<br/>Probst: Previously on Survivor: Merge was on everyone's  mind when the tribes received body paint with tree mail. <br/>If I was a betting woman, and I was in Las Vegas, I'd say  we're merging. <br/>Probst: But the merge never materialized. Reach in and pick a buff. You're now a member of Chapera. Instead, everybody drew buffs to randomly mix up the tribes. What, did you think we were merging? Just switching things up. Against all odds, the tribes stayed intact, merely changing  names, with one exception. Amber-- the only one to change tribes. <br/>I definitely feel like I'm the only one who got screwed in  this whole situation. <br/>Probst: The new Chapera tribe lived it up at their new  beach. <br/>I realized immediately that we were so much better off  over here. <br/>Probst: But the new Mogo Mogo tribe felt their new home  was less that adequate. <br/>It's a crap camp. <br/>Probst: While his tribemates missed their old camp, Rob  just missed Amber. <br/>It kills me to have her over there by herself. <br/>Probst: The Immunity Challenge tested the tribe's  knowledge of Survivorhistory. Mogo Mogo is right. You win immunity. And, in a bold move, Boston Rob offered Lex a deal if he would  save Amber. Before Tribal Council, Amber was aware she was the obvious  target, and tried to turn the heat on Jerri. <br/>Please, Kathy, keep me in the game. Vote for Jerri. <br/>Probst: And Jerri went after Amber, the outsider. <br/>Boston Rob will tell you anything to keep Amber around. <br/>This is when the game changes, when you have to start  making really hard decisions. <br/>Probst: And, at Tribal Council, Lex and Kathy took a  gamble on Rob's future loyalty, and voted Jerri out of the game. Jerri, the tribe has spoken. Nine all-stars are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION [theme  song playing] Getting rid of Jerri Getting rid of Jerri last night at Tribal Council was  horrible. I cut her loose to keep Amber around as a favor to Rob. When I need to cash in with Rob, I'm sure he'll deliver. He's good on his word. <br/>We think that Amber's gone, He's good on his word. <br/>We think that Amber's gone, and it was a very somber mood  around camp. Rob is really sad. That was not only his strong alliance, but, I mean, they're  really dating out here. <br/>I hope Amber is still here. I said some prayers last night and this morning. Not much I can do about it. Maybe Lex came through for me, and that would be great. Ahh! <br/>I've never seen Rob all screwed up like this, but it's  like when a calf's sucking its mama's titty and, when you wean that calf, it  bawls, and it'll go crazy. It tries to go through fences and bushes... Rob's the same way. And it'll take about three days to get a calf weaned from its  mother. A human is about the same. <br/>This situation throws you into a weird kind of arena where  you never know who is going to be your ally. You may think one person is perfect to align with, and then, all  of a sudden, you're, like, what the hell happened, you know? <br/>We can have, like, a little silent alliance going. You know, kind of cover your tracks and be ready. You know what I mean? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I'll be completely alone in this game if Amber is gone. I can't trust anybody. I kind of have a mark on my back, so I got to watch both  shoulders at all times. <br/>I promise you right now. <br/>Okay. <br/>Here's the thing. <br/>If it comes down to it...  If we have...  I promise you, I will fight for you. <br/>I will never write your name down. <br/>All right. <br/>I will never...  I promise you. <br/>...write your name down. <br/>I will never write your name down. <br/>That's it. I won't write your name down. There's no way. I would never screw you over. I'm not going to say that. <br/>I didn't say that to anybody in this game, Alicia. I did not say that to any one person in this came. <br/>Neither did I. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Chapera, come on in! [Jenna L. squeals]  She made it. <br/>Probst: Jerri voted out at the last Tribal Council. Remaining tribe members: Kathy, Shii Ann, Lex and Amber. <br/>Hi, guys. <br/>Hey. <br/>What's up, Kat? <br/>Hey. <br/>Probst: Okay. Let's get to today's Reward Challenge. Even though you are still two tribes, it is an individual Reward  Challenge. Here's how it's going to work. All nine of you will start out on the floating platform. On my go, all nine of you will dive down and retrieve one of  seven pots. Two without a pot will be eliminated. We'll work our way from nine tribe members to seven to five  until we are left with only three. We'll then move to a final round. The three remaining tribe members must transport a heavily  weighted crate from the ocean to the shore. The first person to cross the finish line with their crate wins  Reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>ALL: Yes. <br/>Probst: For the winner, a helicopter will land immediately  following the challenge, take you to a resort. You'll have a nice shower, you'll have a massage, facial, a huge  feast. You'll spend the night-- have a real bed to sleep on. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: In addition, the winner of the challenge will be  allowed to bring two people from either tribe. <br/>That's a biggie. <br/>Wow. <br/>That's big. <br/>Probst: Worth playing for? <br/>ALL: Yes. <br/>Probst: All right, pick your spots out, wait for my go. Here we go, guys. Nine tribe members looking for seven pots. Survivors ready... Go! Get that pot and get back here. First seven move on. Everybody has a pot except for Shii Ann and Jenna. You two are out. We're now down to seven. Looking for five pots. Survivors ready... Go! First five move on to the next round. Everybody back up with their pots. Amber, Kathy are out. <br/>Me and Big Tom were fighting over it. <br/>Probst: We are down to five. The first three to get a pot move on to the final round. Survivors ready... Go! We're looking for three pots. We have our final three. Boston Rob, Rupert, Lex. The other six-- you guys-- can swim on in. All right! It is the final round! First survivor to get their crate across the finish line wins  Reward. [Shii Ann whooping] Survivors ready... Go! Boston Rob swimming out, diving down. Rupert moving with his crate. Lex moving with his crate. Boston Rob still underwater. Rupert with a bit of a lead. Boston Rob still underwater. Rupert with a bit of a lead. Rupert's now on his feet. He's carrying the crate on his shoulder. Boston Rob right behind him. Boston Rob still in it. So is Lex. Boston Rob trying to get it up on his shoulder. It's too heavy. <br/>Go! Go! <br/>Rupert, he's coming! Come on, Rupert! <br/>Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! <br/>Probst: It's a race to the finish. Got to cross the line. Lex falls down. [Jenna L. screaming] Rupert wins Reward! <br/>Way to go, Robbo! <br/>Probst: Rupert, get over here. Nice job. <br/>Won one. <br/>Nice job, Rupert. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Okay, big decision. You can take two people with you on this Reward. It can be any two people you want. Who's going with you? <br/>I honestly wish everybody could come, I do, but Amber, you  can make up for that 24 hours you just spent away from us. You're coming back. <br/>Thank you! <br/>It was a hard one, I know, being away. <br/>Nice. <br/>Jenna. We spent the whole time together. The first Reward we win, we share it. [cheering]  Probst: All right, Rupert, Jenna, Amber, helicopter's  coming in. <br/>Chocolate for me, please. Double chocolate. <br/>Great. Double chocolate. <br/>Great. [Rupert chuckling]  How come I get so [Rupert chuckling]  How come I get so emotional up here? <br/>Ahh! This is so great. <br/>My baby is going to say, "That's my daddy. He is the toughest daddy in the world."  Oh, my gosh, you guys, look where we're landing. Holy crap! In the middle of this? <br/>Oh, my God, that's awesome. I'm so excited. Yeah, dinner, showers, massages, facials and sleep on a bed! <br/>I'm in heaven with two goddesses. [all laughing]  Oh, my God! [gasps]  Look at the shoes! <br/>And we get to keep them, the shoes? <br/>I hope so. <br/>I have not had a reward ever in my Survivorhistory. <br/>These are so fun. <br/>And I took two gorgeous girls. What is this? <br/>It's a skirt. <br/>I want to wear this home. It was a great reward. <br/>There's deodorant... Oh, my God, Amber, they have  deodorant. [women squealing] Motorized toothbrushes...  Mine is blue. <br/>Oh, my gosh, smell the deodorant. Oh, my gosh, smell yours. You get your own. <br/>Oh, please let us be able to take these home. [squeals] No way! Makeup. <br/>Oh, shut up! We can paint our toenails? We're going to get pretty for you tonight. <br/>Beautiful. <br/>Oh, my God, what do you do first? Strip all those dirty clothes off, put on the terry cloth robe  and then take a 20-minute shower using every different sponge available. [water running]  Could you hand me that bar of soap? I'm taking another shower in the morning. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Do you do the deep moisturizing treatment frizz down  before conditioner or after? <br/>Before. <br/>Before? Thank you. <br/>I've never felt so girly. We each get our own Fantastic Lash. That's the kind I use at home, Aqua Smooth. <br/>Really? <br/>Mm-hmm. I wanted to paint my toenails, I wanted to smell good, I wanted  to be pretty. <br/>My lips haven't felt this smooth for so long. <br/>I'm the least girly girl ever. I've never even had a massage or a facial, but after 25 days of  not caring it felt good to care. <br/>Just feels so good. <br/>I'm going to go back there Superman. [chuckling] I can do the last 13 days standing on my head. <br/>I sat down to dinner with Amber and Jenna who were dolled  up to the nines, beautiful lips. I wanted to kiss and hug 'em all over. <br/>To being clean and feeling brand-new. <br/>Brand-new. <br/>Oh, my God, energized and ready for 13 days. No matter how it turns out, when we get home, I have  wholehearted faith in Amber and Rob and Jenna and Big Tom and I. Five strong, solid...  And we have this. I really strongly believe we have this. <br/>I think so. We have a five-way strong no matter what happens. <br/>...happens. We do. <br/>I was a little nervous because I made a deal with Lex and  Kathy that they could come to the end with me, Big Tom and Rob. But I couldn't tell Rupert and Jenna that. <br/>We'll be the powerhouse. <br/>Cheers to that. <br/>I know, my God. [chuckling] It's very good, very good. <br/>We've got mail. Uh-oh. "Rise and shine. It's a good day for competing. If your survival skills aren't sharp, you may take a beating. Make camp life more comfortable, put the horse before the cart. If you don't take your time, it could be over before it  starts."  Survivor skills. <br/>Don't make sense. Never ever in Survivor,they had two rewards back-to-back. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Hello. <br/>Hey, how is it going Jeff Pro-Bodine? <br/>Probst: Now bring in the chopper... Rupert, Amber, Jenna,  returning from their reward. <br/>We missed you. We missed ya. [helicopter whirring]  Probst: Welcome back... Rupert, Jenna, Amber. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Amber, looks like you got your nails done. <br/>I did. <br/>Probst: All right. First things first, Boston Rob... I will take back immunity. A couple of you may realize we are on the former Saboga tribe's  beach. That's because the game is about to change again. Drop your buffs. <br/>Here we go. <br/>Here we go again. [sighs]  Probst: It is time once again for new buffs. <br/>I hope it's a new color we see coming out of there. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob. <br/>No green, no red. <br/>Probst: This time the buff... [cheering] it is the merge  color. [cheering] [Rupert laughing]  Try it on. [cheering and laughing]  We love this. <br/>This is a great color. Didn't like that green. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: All right. Here's how the merge is going to work. You will not be returning to Chapera. You will not be returning to Mogo Mogo. You will live your remaining days right here on Saboga beach. The beach is a little different from when you last left it,  Rupert and Jenna. Strong tides, heavy storms pretty much wiped away your shelter. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: The timber's still here. Your toolbox is still here. You've got plenty of nails and rope and wire. Some of your pots are scattered around here. You're going to have to scavenge, you're gonna have to find this  stuff, but you can build shelter again. You've got Boston Rob who's proven he knows what he's doing. And because you guys have shown that you can survive out here 26  days, we figure you do deserve a little bit of a housewarming gift. In keeping with Survivor: All-Stars...  Oh...! What? <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Probst: We have a few items to help you out with your new  camp. <br/>And a canvas. <br/>Probst: Two Hawaiian slings and a tarp to help keep you  dry, paints for your new tribe flag. You'll need to come up a new tribe name. <br/>Yay! <br/>Probst: The day is already half over. Storms can come in at any time. This is your new home. Get to work. <br/>Yes! <br/>We have Chapera, Mogo We have Chapera, Mogo Mogo and Saboga. <br/>Right. So how about...  Sapera Mogo. I kind of like Bogamopera. Boga... mo... pera. <br/>Hey, you guys? What do you think of Bogamopera? That's all of us combined, all the tribes. <br/>It's not bad. <br/>How about Chaboga Mogo? <br/>Chaboga Mogo...  Sounds like a dance. <br/>Chaboga Mogo Chaboga Mogo Let's do it. I love it! <br/>I'm thrilled to be merged, if for no other reason just  because now the game has changed up. This is where it gets exciting for a game player like me who  just enjoys playing the game of Survivor. <br/>As soon as we merged, Lex comes running over to me,  "Rob, make me feel comfortable. Tell me that I'm safe. Tell me that I'm safe." I will do everything I can, and you  got other friends in the game, too. Yeah. You know what I mean? <br/>Yep. <br/>I'm making the deal, "Save Amber and I'm going to  help you later on." You guys didn't really believe that, did you? Come on! <br/>If I get a sense that, you know, I'm going to end up  getting, you know, doublecrossed, get a knife in my back next Tribal Council,  I certainly won't be happy about that. <br/>I won't stick a knife in your back, man. I ain't gonna do that. <br/>All right. <br/>I haven't played that way this time around at all. I've been playing the game since the second I got here. It's all a game, everything. Make no mistake about it, I am playing the game. When I saw you come out of that challenge, I was, like, so happy  when I seen you, man. I was so happy. Listen, this is the way it has to go down-- we need to get rid  of Lex tomorrow. <br/>Why not Jenna or Rupert first? I'm here because of him. <br/>Don't go soft on me. I know it sucks. I promised him the same thing. He came up to me, first person he came up to. <br/>It's not even that. It's not that... I'm just... I don't know, I'm scared. <br/>Don't be scared. <br/>What if they're targeting us? You and I are stirring all this up. Do you know what I mean? There's too many plans floating around and too many people are  talking. They're going to realize that it's all coming down to us very  soon and then they are going to get rid of us instead of getting rid of  somebody else. <br/>It's not coming down to us because as soon as Lex is gone,  Big Tom doesn't have a leg to stand on. I mean, this is a game, Amber. We're playing for a million bucks over here, you know? Like, let me tell you something, Jenna and Rupert and Big Tom,  they're all gonna try to stick it in our backs, too, all right? <br/>We've got our work cut out for us because we have so many  deals going along with so many people. We have deals with Lex and Kathy. We have deals with Rupert and Jenna. We have a deal with Big Tom. Who the hell knows what's going on with Alicia? It's insane. My mind is like, freaking out right now. <br/>Yeah, I definitely missed you. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! All right. Let's get to today's first individual immunity challenge. Tribal immunity is no more. This is what you covet. <br/>Wow. That's cool. <br/>Probst: As long as you are wearing the immunity necklace,  you are safe from the vote at Tribal Council. When you don't have this on, you are vulnerable, and now that we  are in an individual game, it becomes all that much more important. Today's immunity challenge will test your skills in the water. First round is a traditional hold-your-breath competition. You will be divided into groups of men and women: The two men  who stay down the longest will move on to the final round; the two women who  stay down the longest will move on to the final round. For the final round, you will race along a ladder, which is tethered  to the ocean floor. Along the way, you'll be releasing a series of buoys. The first person to release all ten buoys wins immunity. Here's the twist. We will run the final leg twice. Two men will run the final leg. The winner receives immunity. Two women will run the final leg. The winner receives immunity. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: So at tonight's Tribal Council, two  people...  Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: ...will be wearing the necklace. Two people will be safe from the vote. <br/>That's big. <br/>Probst: I know at this point in the game-- huge stakes. <br/>That's huge. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Swim out. Wait for my go. All right, guys. Here we go. The two women that stay down the longest and the two men to stay  down the longest move on to the final round. Three, two, one, go down. Alicia and Jenna are up. First three women are up. Amber and Kathy are moving on. Rupert can't hang on any longer, Rob, Tom and Lex still fighting  for the final two. Big Tom's out. Lex and Boston Rob moving on to the final. Kathy and Amber moving on to the final. All right. First woman to release all ten buoys wins immunity. Survivors, ready? Go! Kathy and Amber both have their first buoys up. Dead even at two. 3-3. They're dead even at four buoys each. Amber with her fifth. Amber with a slight lead. One buoy. Amber with her sixth buoy. Kathy with her fifth. Amber leads six buoys-five. Kathy still struggling. Get a breath. Kathy, you're still in it. <br/>I can't get the knot. <br/>Probst: Fatigue starting to set in. Kathy with her sixth buoy. We're tied up 6-6. Kathy takes the lead now 7-6. Kathy with eight buoys now. Kathy continues to fight with nine buoys. One left, Kathy. Amber with her seventh buoy. Kathy with a 9-7 lead. [Kathy belches]  This challenge sucks. <br/>Probst: Let's go, Amber, get down and get a buoy. There it is! Kathy has her tenth buoy and the flag. Kathy wins immunity! Incredible effort. [cheering] Here we go. Kathy already has immunity. We are looking for a second immunity winner. Survivors, ready? Go! <br/>We're tied up at five. Go! <br/>We're tied up at five. Both guys are up. Tied up at five. Lex back down, Boston Rob getting his breath. Lex has a lead, 7-6. Lex pulling ahead, eight buoys to six. Boston Rob with his seventh. Lex with a one-buoy lead, 8-7. Lex with his ninth buoy. Boston Rob with his eighth. Lex is one buoy away. Boston Rob ties it up. We're 9-9. We are dead even, one buoy left. Lex can't get it. Still struggling. Boston Rob down a long time. He's got it! Boston Rob comes from behind, wins immunity! Hell of an effort, guys. Congratulations. Nice job. <br/>Thank you. You are safe at the vote tonight. Nice effort. Safe at the vote tonight. <br/>Thank you. Thank you. <br/>Probst: For the first time, guys, two people will be safe  at tonight's Tribal Council. Everyone else is vulnerable. See you at Tribal. <br/>There's something very See you at Tribal. <br/>There's something very telling about the fact that we've  been here now together merged for a whole day and there's been absolutely--  he hasn't lifted a finger to make us feel comfortable. <br/>No, he's pulling our chain. <br/>Yeah, he's yanking on our chain. <br/>I know, and I'm so discouraged by it. <br/>I realize that I made a huge mistake. I made a potentially game-ending blunder in agreeing to keep  Amber and get rid of Jerri, and I think I may be about to pay for it. <br/>I just want to let you know that I appreciate everything  you did to save Amber, but myself, Amber, Big Tom, Jenna, Alicia and,  uh...  Rupert. <br/>...Rupert have agreed to stay together as a group. <br/>I can't even believe what I'm hearing. <br/>I know. <br/>Let me tell you something right now. That was not a game or strategy decision. <br/>It was a strategy decision. You have nothing to be angry about. <br/>It was a brother coming to another brother saying friend  to friend, and you know what, I had my game all worked out, and if I had  gotten rid of Amber, you know what I would have come in here with? I would have come in here with my numbers advantage and I did  that just because you're my friend. <br/>In fact, I-I-I completely... my own game. I screwed my own game up. <br/>I'm sorry, buddy. <br/>I just can't believe what I'm hearing. <br/>You're asking me to screw everybody else now for you. <br/>You've got more allegiance to them than you've got to  me... after asking me for a special friend favor. <br/>I made an agreement with them. I asked you for a favor. <br/>It's about being betrayed by my friend. It's about getting a knife in the back. <br/>Like, honestly, I don't know what you want me to say, Lex. I know, like...  I want you to say that you're going to be truthful to the  word you gave me. <br/>The word I gave you-- make no mistake about it, Lex--  between you and I, and you want to put our friendship on the line, I'll put  our friendship on the line over this. The word I gave you was that if I can take care of you, I will. I'm sorry, I cannot. <br/>We were always thinking of bringing you along, babe--  always, always until the bitter end. He was proud to bring you to the final four. <br/>I'm sorry. <br/>That's brutal. <br/>It is. <br/>It's brutal. <br/>Brutal. <br/>Absolutely brutal. <br/>Brutal. Man, I should have listened to you: "No friends in this  game."  I asked you for a favor and if there was anything I could  do, Lex, I would. <br/>That's just it. There's a lot you can do. <br/>No, the only thing I can do is to break my word and screw  everybody else. <br/>I just, I just don't understand. I mean, you're breaking my heart, I can't... I can't even  believe it. <br/>...and that's why I'm crying because I actually came to  him. <br/>I-I would...  I'm sorry you feel that way. I really, truly am. I'm really sorry that you feel that way. <br/>Despite the fact that Boston Rob is a really nice kid,  there's something inside of him that came out in Marquesas that's still here. And it's just so sad. It's so sad. <br/>He put a knife in my back. <br/>Yeah. Well, this is what I'm doing. I don't want to stay here. [crying]  Sweetie pie, come here. <br/>No, I don't want it. <br/>Honey...  I don't want it. <br/>I don't blame you. <br/>I don't believe it's just a game, not when friendships are  involved, so I would like to give my immunity to Lex tonight and if I get  voted off, I'm gone. I mean, my options are to do that or to come back here cowering. I'm giving it to you tonight. I hate it. <br/>No, no, no, no. <br/>This isn't worth it. <br/>No, no, you earned it. <br/>I can go make a million dollars somewhere. <br/>No, no, no, honey. No, no. <br/>Look. Look at me. If Lex got voted out tonight and Boston Rob got away with it,  uh-uh. I am not doing that. <br/>Probst: Welcome to Tribal I am not doing that. <br/>Probst: Welcome to Tribal Council, where, once again,  tonight you must vote somebody out of this game. A little different stakes tonight, though. The person voted out tonight will become the first member of the  jury. So, from this point forward, it not only matters who you vote  out, but how you vote them out, because ultimately only two of you will make  it to the final two. The other seven will make up the jury, who will decide who wins  the million dollars. Having said that, let's get to the last few days. Rupert, did the game ratchet up a notch today? <br/>Today when we got back to our camp, everything was tested,  you know... alliances were tested, physical endurance was tested. Your mental abilities, everything was tested. Today was a very hard day. <br/>Probst: So there's more to the looks of despair and huge  bags than just the physical. It's the mental part of what is happening right now in the game. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: Can you get it back? Is tomorrow another day? <br/>Tomorrow is most definitely another day. <br/>Hopefully the sun comes out tomorrow. We need the sun. <br/>Tomorrow is most definitely another-- a new day. As the rain comes...  Probst: As the rain starts to send you a signal that  Mother Nature may not be on the same game plan as you. <br/>You got two choices, Jeff, laugh or cry. <br/>Probst: Lex, how much has the game changed in the last 24  hours, now that it is an individual game? <br/>The game has changed in a huge way for those of us who  came from Chapera. For us, life has become much more of a true game of survival, a  struggle. It's a different game for us for sure. <br/>Probst: So it's a long, cold night with eight people who  will be going back that aren't necessarily getting along at this point, fair  to say, Jenna? <br/>Very fair to say. There's a lot of arguments, today, centered around loyalties,  alliances, tribal voting lines, and who is going tonight, and game plans are  spoken aloud and it wasn't nice for anyone to hear. <br/>Probst: Amber, you going to go back to a camp divided? <br/>I think... Yeah. I think going back to camp tonight will be very uncomfortable,  um, but it's a very important vote, a very important vote. <br/>I've got something I want to say. I know we're playing a game, but I know, like, emotions are real  and feelings are real out here, and regardless of what happens, I just want  everybody to know that if I'm your friend, I'm your friend, and after this is  over, you don't want to be my friend, then I can't do anything about that...  But friendship is lasting. <br/>Probst: I just want to give everybody here a hug. Man, you guys look awful. All right. Let's get to the vote. For the first time ever, we have two people with immunity, Kathy  and Boston Rob. As always, if you guys want to give that immunity up for some  reason, you certainly can. Boston Rob, you're shaking, is that a no or just a shiver? <br/>I covet this. <br/>Probst: You're not giving it up. Kathy, you keeping yours? <br/>I thought about it. I'm keeping it. <br/>Probst: Okay. Kathy cannot be voted for. Boston Rob cannot be voted for. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. Big Tom, you're up. <br/>I'd much rather be casting this vote for your little  errand boy, but you're just gonna have to do. <br/>Hey, buddy, sorry about the vote. Thanks for keeping Amber around. I hope we can get over this, man. [Kathy sighs] man. [Kathy sighs]  Amber, you didn't have to tell me that Boston Rob and you  were going to bring us to the final six. I just don't like getting lied to that big. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Probst: Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: "Amber." "Amber." That's two  votes Amber. "Lex." "Lex." That's two votes Lex, two  votes Amber. That's three votes Lex. That's four votes Lex. Tenth person voted out of Survivor: All-Starsand the first  member of our jury, Lex. That's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Good luck, y'all. <br/>Probst: Lex, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Well, you've lasted 27 days. I know it's been a long, wet, rainy day. The rain has stopped. Maybe it's a sign. Either way, you got to dig deep. You got 12 days left-- a one-ineight shot at a million bucks. Grab your torches and head back to camp. Good night. [theme song playing]  Probst: Next time [theme song playing]  Probst: Next time on Survivor:The All-Stars get a glimpse  of home. Maybe give you what you need to get you through these last 11  days. And Kathy stirs things up. <br/>Yeah, you should. I don't want her to win. <br/>I see what's happening right now. I think they are switching. <br/>I think we've got some last-minute scrambling going on in  Panama today. <br/>Wow. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed, but I came into  this game the wealthiest man in the world. I have an amazing wife, two beautiful sons, a loving family and  the greatest group of friends a man could ever hope for. Everything above and beyond that is gravy as far as I'm  concerned. Big Tom, you get out there and give 'em hell. I'll be rooting for you all the way. Love ya.
