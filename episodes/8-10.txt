<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously, on Survivor: After Colby was  ousted by Lex's surprise plan, Jerri celebrated. [Jerri laughs] And Ethan, who was told Jerri was the target,  felt betrayed. <br/>I made an assumption, thought everything was going  smoothly and, boom. <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge, Chapera rolled their way  to victory...  Oh! <br/>Probst: Amber wins the award for Chapera! ...winning them the right to loot Mogo Mogo's rice, grill and  fishing spear. <br/>I've been waiting 20 days to not have to poke fish with a  stick. <br/>Probst: Late that night, Rob and Amber finally connected. <br/>I love that he, you know, keeps me warm at night, and he  makes me feel safe out here. <br/>Probst: The following morning, Rupert realized he wasn't  the sole provider. <br/>I'm just glad he caught a fish. <br/>Boston style. <br/>Boston Rob. He's kind of an arrogant pain in the ass. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, Jerri took a gamble and  put Mogo Mogo's fate in her own hands... Wide to the right. Chapera wins immunity. ...and lost. Back at camp, Jerri was relieved when Lex told her that Ethan  was the target. <br/>I'm just glad it's not me. <br/>Probst: And to avoid blindsiding his friend from Africa,  Lex told Ethan he was next to go. <br/>It has nothing to do with friendship. This is... this is business. <br/>Probst: Ethan scrambled to stay. <br/>Jerri's going to get further than you and Shii Ann. <br/>No. <br/>She might. <br/>Probst: But at Tribal Council, Ethan was trapped and  couldn't fight his way out. Ethan. The last former winner was the eighth all-star to go. The tribe has spoken. Ten all-stars are left. Who will be voted out tonight?

[saw cutting]  Tom and I are definitely the worker bees on Chapera. I'm not happy for anybody to lay their ass around in the shelter  and let me do all the work, but... I can't go in there and say, "Get  your ass out of that bed and go to work." I can't say that. Hopefully, the merge is coming soon, because once we get merged,  there's other people, those Mogo Mogo Mogos hopefully will actually work. <br/>Me and Rupert, we get up early, and the rest of them lays  in, and we go fishing about every morning. And if you see that harpoon, that's the hardest thing to get  that there ever was, 'cause Rupert been the biggest damn hog I've ever seen  on that thing. I've been here 22 days, and I've yet to touch it, and I ain't  leaving here today till I get in that water with that harpoon. I'm gonna catch some fish. <br/>You gonna get in the water? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Right now. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I wondered why you was putting your shoes on. You're gonna go in the water with your shoes on? <br/>TOM: Yeah. <br/>Okay. <br/>I'll see you when I catch one. <br/>Okay, good luck. <br/>...might be dark. <br/>That's okay. I'll sit here all day. <br/>All right. <br/>Bring that whale on in! <br/>All right. <br/>Bring that whale on in! <br/>All right. <br/>Bring that whale on in! Very good, Big Tom, very good. You are the fisher-man. Big Tom did get him a little fish. Not a bad fish for his first fish ever on the spear. That probably hits in the goldfish category. That's a fish tank fish. But Big Tom got it, and he was thrilled. <br/>This rack is wet. thrilled. <br/>This rack is wet. This place sucks. The weather here, it's wet, all the time-- just dank, moldy and  wet, all the time. And it's really, really starting to take its toll on me. <br/>Come on, baby, promise me you got an ember under there. Lots of... lots of patience. Mornings are always tough for me, just 'cause you wake up and  there's just nothing to burn. The wet and rain is just too hard. There's no dry wood. It's just, today, not worth it. And being on a, you know, the losing team all the time, it's  just depressing. <br/>Hey, you guys. We got some tree mail. "Today you may improve your way of life. It's just a means to the ends. It may be a battle royal, or you just might make some  friends."  Huh. <br/>Merge. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think it might be a merge. The tree mail today came with green paint, which we don't know  what to do with yet. Either paint each other or paint something, but it's green. Mogo Mogo colors, so...  I don't know if that's face paint, so don't put it it on  your face yet. <br/>Oh, I wasn't going to. If I was a betting woman and I was in Las Vegas, I'd say we're  merging. <br/>I can't tell if that's body paint or not. I have no idea what the green paint is about. I think at this point, rather than show up looking like a bunch  of, you know, weirdos with paint, we may just bring the pot of paint with us. <br/>Immediately we take the body paint and start to paint each  other. The guys have big bulls on their chest, and the girls do, like,  dots and arrows and... fun stuff. You like that? <br/>I love it. <br/>We took the paint, and tick-tock, pokey-pokey,  rubby-rubby. We was just tickled to death. [bellows]  We know that we're going to go to the challenge. We don't know if it's going to be a merge. We know something is going to happen. <br/>Jeff: Chapera, come on in! Looking good. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: I like it. <br/>We had fun. <br/>We did. Thanks for the paint. <br/>Probst: Mogo Mogo, come on in. Chapera getting your first look at the new Mogo Mogo Tribe. Ethan voted out at the last Tribal Council. <br/>Good. <br/>Probst: What's going on, Mogo Mogo? <br/>How's it going, Jeff? <br/>Hi. <br/>Hey, guys. <br/>Looking dandy in the red. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: All right, first thing I notice, you were both  given a can of paint. Chapera, what made you guys put it on your body? There was no direction. Rob, is this a sign of team spirit in a way? <br/>Yeah, I guess so. We're having a good time over there painting each other. <br/>Probst: At the other end of the spectrum, why did you guys  decide to do nothing, Kathy? <br/>Um, we're just... we're the civil tribe. [laughter] No. We're just, uh... we like to save things, I guess. We like to conserve. <br/>My canvas is full. <br/>Probst: Okay, here's what I want to happen. Mogo Mogo, choose an order, one through four. Chapera, choose an order, one through six, but because you have  two extra people, numbers five and six will not have a say. Huddle up and decide and line up in order. Okay, we're gonna alternate between tribes. Lex, as number one for Mogo Mogo, you will start. Pick one member from Chapera that you would like to sit down and  have a private conversation with, separated from everybody else. <br/>I believe I'll take you, Rob. <br/>'Kay. <br/>Probst: All right, Lex and Rob, over here. You're the first pair. Big Tom, pick somebody from Mogo Mogo. <br/>Uh... I'll take Jerri. <br/>Probst: 'Kay. Jerri and big Tom gonna have a little chat. Shii Ann. <br/>I'm gonna pick Rupert, 'cause we're both here alone. <br/>Probst: All right, Rupert, you and Shii Ann are gonna get  a chance to chat. Alicia, your pick has been made for you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Let's chat. <br/>Probst: Amber and Jenna, you're gonna get a little more  time together. <br/>Yay! [laughter]  Probst: So we thought it might be fun 22 days in to have a  formal chance to get to know people from the other tribe. To make it more enjoyable... we put together a little snack  lunch. [cheering]  Oh, my God! Food. <br/>[laughing]: Yay! Yay! <br/>Thank you! <br/>Probst: Find a spot anywhere you like, have a private  conversation. <br/>I knew this was so peculiar, I thought it was going to be  something devastating. <br/>What a day to pick a good-looking woman. <br/>Oh, shucks, I think I'm blushing. <br/>How perfect is this? I'm glad we get to relax. <br/>I was like, oh, my God, they have to go find out about  each other. <br/>Oh, my God, Rupert! Let's dig in. Oh, those are good. <br/>So what's it like over there all by yourself? Are you getting along? <br/>I love Kathy and I love Lex. Jerri is nice, but she doesn't work as hard as the rest of us. <br/>I was so happy to get away from her. <br/>I was worried about you at first. <br/>I was worried about me. You know what? This game almost broke my spirit. <br/>That's why I'm here. They cannot get you down. We got 18 days. You suck it up, be the stud you are, put your chest out. <br/>It's been a humbling experience, to say the least. <br/>You know, I'm ready for a merge, I'm ready for all of us  to be one tribe, I'm ready for individual challenges, I'm ready to change the  game. <br/>Rob is really the dangerous one. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>It seems, because if we go to individual immunities, that  guy is going to win and win and win and win and win. <br/>I know. <br/>And win. <br/>The fact that we're having this picnic leads me to believe  that we are going to merge. They're just... waiting. <br/>Probst: Fall in right in here. Any order. All right, drop your buffs. <br/>Here we go. <br/>Probst: Drop them at your feet-- time for some new buffs. Lex. Reach in and pick a buff. You're now a member of Chapera. Have a spot on the red map. <br/>Wow. This is sweet. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob... What did you think, we were merging? Just switching things up. Look at that, you're now a member of Mogo Mogo. You look good in green. <br/>I like red. <br/>Probst: Big Tom. Another member of Mogo Mogo. Sticking with Boston Rob. You'll still be living as two separate tribes, it's just new  tribes, that's the only difference. Jerri, member of Chapera. So far, nothing has changed but the color of the buffs. <br/>Wow, that's weird. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob, you don't look pleased about this. <br/>They get our camp now? We're not pleased. Shii Ann, Chapera. It continues. <br/>Weird. <br/>Probst: Rupert, you going to be with your old fellas now? Look at that. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>God! <br/>Probst: So far, six tribe members have picked buffs and  everything is exactly flipped. Maybe Kathy will find a new tribe. Unbelievable. <br/>Weird. This is weird. <br/>Probst: Something about these tribes is just meant to be. All right, Alicia. You got green. Still no change to the make-up of each tribe. <br/>This is just weird. <br/>It is weird. <br/>Probst: We have two buffs left, one red, one green. Jenna. Mogo Mogo. Amber is the only one to change tribes. You stay with Chapera but your tribe members are all new. <br/>Hi, guys. I'll show you around camp. <br/>Probst: Kind of weird, huh, Rupert? <br/>Very weird. <br/>Probst: Like it was meant to be. <br/>Well, Amber should be here. <br/>Amber should be here. <br/>The only change is Amber. All right, so, Lex, Jerri, Amber, Shii Ann, Kathy, you will be  living now at Chapera's camp. Boston Rob, Big Tom, Alicia, Rupert, Jenna, you're going to Mogo  Mogo. Everything you left at camp this morning belongs to the new  owners: the Hawaiian sling, the fish you may have caught, ready to eat. Head on out to your new homes. <br/>This is crazy. <br/>Amber. <br/>Thanks for being  Amber. <br/>Thanks for being  Amber. <br/>Thanks for being our hostess. <br/>I definitely feel like I'm the one who got screwed in this  whole situation. Kind of nice that I'm still back at home. Gosh, I was so mad. When Jeff held up the new pot full of buffs and we're all  picking them out, one by one, really, the main thought that was going through  my head was, "Let me just pull the same color that Rob pulls." This  is our camp. This is our swing. <br/>Look at the sofa. <br/>Oh, my God, look at your sofa! <br/>This is our lounge chair. We have a toilet. <br/>We came back to our new home, I realized immediately that  we were so much better off over here. I was so excited. <br/>This is so cool. <br/>It's beautiful. It's nice to have someplace to sit besides...  And a place for your feet, too. <br/>Oh, my gosh, it is paradise. <br/>It's the freakin' Four Seasons. <br/>And there's so much wood here. <br/>They have huge stacks of logs and dry wood. There's embers in the fire. There's a swing and a bench and, you know, a kitchen area. I mean, it's an organized, beautiful camp. <br/>So you like it? <br/>I'm really-- I'm just amazed. <br/>Yeah! <br/>We almost cried for joy when we saw the  welcome-to-your-newhome basket of food and drink. [cheering]  Wow. Look at the bread. The cheese is so good, you guys. <br/>Toast to... welcome to your new home. Hope I can make it as comfortable as possible. <br/>You already have. You already have, Amber. To some civilized talk and food. <br/>To more fun. It's a little strange having everybody here. It's definitely not home without the people that belong here. It kind of sucks. <br/>The new Mogo Mogo It kind of sucks. <br/>The new Mogo Mogo definitely got the short end of this  stick, because we inherited a camp that is in complete disarray. <br/>I have to go get water, and they only have one pot,  so...  They obviously haven't maintained anything. Their shelter is tiny. They have very little firewood. They haven't cleaned up around camp. <br/>You guys don't want to try to like make a new shelter or nothing? You want to just...  I say we try to make the roof better on that one. I know how bad you want to build another shelter. <br/>It isn't that. I just want to be able to sleep at night and I don't think I'll  be able to sleep in that thing. <br/>Now, all of a sudden, we have to make a living here-- no  blankets, no pillows, nothing. It's a crap camp. It's in the middle of nettles. I don't know why they built it where they did. It's practically getting washed away by the tide, which is  extremely high. They lost their saws, their cooking pot, it's a mess. <br/>Look at that. That red...  Wow. <br/>One nice thing, when we got here, there was a huge tray of  food, and we immediately sat down and started eating it. But, you know, losing Amber and losing our camp all in one fell  swoop, we didn't feel like we had too much to celebrate. <br/>It's a shame Amber's not here. <br/>It is. <br/>It is a shame. <br/>They got all our rice. They got the spear back, they got the shelter, they got all the  food, they got all the blankets, they got all the pillows, they got  everything. <br/>Well, you know what's nice about this? Let them be impressed with what we've done. They're going to go there and realize how well we've been  living. Maybe that will knock 'em down even further, 'cause they suck. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Conditioner. <br/>There's the shampoo. <br/>We're going to wash our hair. My hair is so nappy. <br/>I had a feeling that the shampoo and the toothbrush were  going to be the first things they grabbed. So things like that are hard. <br/>Chaperans rock! I love being a Chaperan. <br/>They're already making themselves at home, it's kind of  weird, but something I'm going to have to get used to. This is the new home. It's the new Chapera. <br/>I was at my lowest point this morning. Those guys are kicking themselves. Unfair trade. <br/>I hope she's all right; I really do. <br/>Amber? She'll be okay. <br/>She's got to be hurting though. <br/>Yeah, she's got to be. <br/>I wish it were me. I would have been able to handle it a lot better. I care about her. It kills me to have her over there over by herself. I know she's tough, but... ...so much of the reason why she was  having such a good time, and why I was having such a good time, was because  of each other. Here's to Amber. <br/>To Amber. <br/>To Amber. <br/>Hope she makes it. <br/>Damn straight. <br/>Yeah, she'll make it. <br/>I don't really care that the other team has our camp now. I don't even really care that they have all of our possessions. As much as we're crying about it over here, it doesn't matter. What aggravates me is they got my girl over there. <br/>The flag is up. my girl over there. <br/>The flag is up. Our first tree mail as Chapera. <br/>What is it? <br/>It's a book. "Mike fell in a fire. Susan's 'rats and snakes.' Ghandia screamed, 'You're way too  close.' The Amazon Women had what it takes. Seven countries later, 112 Have played the game. How well you know your history determines who will  remain."  Wow. <br/>Wow! <br/>Okay. Mike fell in the fire. Mike caught the pig. <br/>Keith couldn't make rice. Kell got caught with beef jerky. <br/>We were boning up on our Survivortrivia before we went to  the challenge and kind of trying to forecast what questions would be asked. <br/>Thailand. John Raymond. <br/>One of the things we went over was the first person booted  from every single Survivor. <br/>Pearl Islands. <br/>That girl. <br/>With the dress. <br/>You don't remember the name of the woman in the blue  dress. <br/>No. <br/>What else? <br/>This is probably the most important challenge yet to me,  throughout the entire game, 'cause I really feel that by wining this  challenge, I'm either keeping my life going in the game of Survivoror ending  my life in the game of Survivor. <br/>How many Jennas have played this game? <br/>Two, two Jennas. <br/>How many Robs? <br/>Four. <br/>Four. <br/>I promised Amber I would take her to the end with me, but  I've got to figure out a way to get her there. I'm gonna do whatever I can do to keep her around as long as  possible over there. Pretty much the next move I make is gonna have consequences for  everybody left in this game-- serious consequences. <br/>Probst: First things first. Take back the immunity idol. You guys didn't earn it, but you inherited it had and you became  the Chapera Tribe. Doesn't matter. Immunity is back up for grabs. Let's get to today's immunity challenge. It's going to test your knowledge about something you should  know a lot about: Survivor. I'm going ask you a series of questions pertaining to Survivorsone  through seven. There are a equal number of questions from each. I'll draw them randomly from this bin. It's a tribal challenge. You will confer, give me one answer. The first tribe to ten wins immunity, guaranteed a one-innine  shot of being the sole survivor in this all-star edition, and a one-in-nine  shot at a million bucks. Make sense? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Take a spot on the bench. <br/>Probst: Ready to get started? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: First question. "In the Marquesas, which survivor's arrival at camp was  best described by another tribe member as 'almost like Cleopatra'?"  Confer, write it down and don't reveal till I ask you to. Let's reveal. "Sarah, Sarah." Both tribes say Sarah. Both tribes are right: 1-1. Next question: "In Africa, which unlikely pair shared a  date at the drive-in movie?" Let's reveal. Mogo Mogo says "Frank and Brandon." Chapera says  "Brandon and Frank." You're both right. Another point for both tribes. We're tied up 2-2. "In what country did Survivor: Africatake  place?"  What is it? <br/>Probst: Reveal. Chapera says "Kenya." That's right. Mogo Mogo says "Nairobi." That's wrong. Chapera scores. 3-2 lead. <br/>Nice, nice. <br/>Probst: "In Survivor: Borneo what specifically did  the "survivors eat in the first-ever food-eating challenge?"  Is that right? <br/>Yes. <br/>Good... I mean, the right term? <br/>Yes. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Reveal. Jenna specifically says: "Butok [bug larvae.]" Butok  is right. Chapera says "grubs." "Grubs" is not  specific enough, not right. We're tied up 3-3. <br/>I was wondering if it was too broad. <br/>Probst: Again from Survivor I:"Which of the original  castaways used the alphabet strategy when voting tribe members off the  island?"  No. Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: Both tribes reveal. Chapera says "Dr. Sean." Mogo Mogo says "Dr. Sean." Both right. We're tied up at four. "Which outback survivor had to be airlifted out of the  game?" Reveal. "Mike Skupin, Mike Skupin." Both tribes right. We are still tied 5-5. Next question: "Which Marquesas survivor picked the unlucky  purple stone during a Tribal Council tiebreaker resulting in their exit from  the game?" Reveal. "Paschal. Paschal." You're both right. You're tied at 6-6. "In Survivor: Thailand,whom did Rob Zubotnik grab by the  neck and toss in the water during a challenge?" Reveal. Chapera says "Clay." Mogo Mogo says "Clay."  Clay is right. You're still tied, 7-7. "In the Pearl Islands, who was a mortician?" Both  tribes reveal. Chapera says "Darrah." Mogo Mogo says  "Darrah." "Darrah" is correct. <br/>I remember Darrah. [wolf whistles]  Probst: We remain tied, 8-8. "In the Pearl Islands, which castaway had to be rescued by  tribe mates during a water challenge?" Reveal. Both tribes say "Osten." Both tribes are right. We are 9-9. "What was Kell accused of smuggling into the outback by his  tribe?" Reveal. "Beef jerky" is right. We're tied up at ten. We move into a tie-breaker. It's going to be a time trial. You'll have 30 seconds to answer this question. "Name the first person voted off each Survivorin  order." Begin. [whispering]  Probst: Ten seconds. Rob working it for Mogo Mogo. [whispering] Got some last-minute additions. <br/>We're done. <br/>Probst: The tribe with the most correct will win immunity. Reveal. Chapera, you say: "Sonya, Deb, Diane, Peter, John and  Ryan." Those first six are right. Number seven, you said "Kim." That is wrong. <br/>Aw...  Probst: You got six of seven. Mogo Mogo you say: "Sonya, Deb, Diane, Peter, John, Brian  and Nicole." Mogo Mogo is right. You win immunity. Congratulations. Who wants it? <br/>I'll grab it for us. <br/>Probst: You're going to be the grabber of immunity? <br/>I'm the taker. <br/>Probst: It seems to stick with you guys, no matter what  color buff you're wearing. Chapera, sadly, Tribal Council tonight. Somebody else from your tribe going home. I'll see you there. Head on back. <br/>If you can, if you can. <br/>Probst: Lex, move it out. <br/>Kind of a bittersweet win there. <br/>Very bittersweet. <br/>Very bittersweet. We did what we needed to do, but...  You're exactly right. <br/>...at the expense of one of our own. <br/>Today, after the challenge was over, I grabbed Lex. I said, "If you can save Amber, I'll remember it, and I'll  help you later on in the game." If Lex is smart, he'll keep her around. <br/>To hoping that Amber can figure out some damn way to stay. <br/>I hope you make it. <br/>Hope you make it, Amber. <br/>Today is hard. It's wicked hard. It hurts a lot. More than anything in the world, I want to take Amber to the  final two. I put an "A" on my arm for Amber. Hopefully she makes it to the next challenge. <br/>Keeps on rolling, man, at Chapera. God! We got back from the challenge, and we lost once again. What else is new? <br/>That's a drag. <br/>So, the interesting dynamic that occurred was, at the end  of the challenge, Boston Rob went up to Lex and said, "To protect Amber,  I'll protect you." I overheard it, and it's such a godfather move. <br/>What do you want to do? 'Cause we've got to make our decision fast. <br/>Well, the thing is, if we keep Amber, we are totally  sucking up to Mariano. <br/>We are, and I don't think Mariano's going to last that  long. Kathy and I are trying to figure out where the possibilities  are. And so far, it still looks like we're going to have to vote out  Amber. <br/>You know, Amber is never going to be on our side ever. <br/>No. That would be the simplest thing. You vote off Amber, that's one less original Chaperan. However...  Mariano is just going to flip. <br/>Mariano's going to flip. He has never, ever...  He's got to be pissed, though, that he's losing his chick. <br/>If we take Amber out, Rob Mariano's going to be pretty  upset. And he's going to... the wrath of God will come down upon us. &gt; So, Amber-Gamber...  So, Kathy? I'm voting for Jerri. That's my desperate attempt. Well, we lost the immunity challenge, so now it's strategy. What am I going to do? I think I'm a better player than Jerri. <br/>You are. <br/>And I'm stronger in the challenges than Jerri. <br/>So, how are you going to get us convinced to vote for  Jerri? [both chuckling]  Do you want me to get down on my knees and beg? Please, Kathy, keep me in the game. Vote for Jerri. Right now, I'm just going to try to make a lot of deals and  promise them a longer time in the game if they promise me a longer time in  the game. This is the deal. In the end, it comes down to you, Lex, me, Rob and Big Tom. That's what I think. <br/>How do we convince Lex to get rid of Jerri? <br/>Well, doesn't he think that Big Tom will be on our side in  the end? <br/>He does think Big Tom will be on our side, yeah. And he thinks Rob will come over, too. <br/>So...  Um, but he's stuck on this tribal loyalty thing. I'll talk to Lex about it. I've just been talking to Amber, and, um, I actually think it  might make sense to keep her. Just because, if we do merge, Mariano is going to carry a grudge  on that one. <br/>[sighing]: All right. <br/>I know. <br/>I need a little time to think about this. <br/>I know. 'Cause I think Mariano is going to hold a grudge. You do realize that he's going to kind of be pissed. <br/>If we delivered, I think he would deliver. <br/>He will deliver. <br/>The only thing about this that just reeks is that it is  just... it is absolutely horrible for Jerri. <br/>I know it is. <br/>But I do think that I can exploit the favor...  Please! <br/>...to our advantage. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Instead of getting rid of Amber tonight, the decision to  vote Jerri out instead makes more strategic sense. So... I need to tell Jerri. You know I love you. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>And you know I have to be straight with you. <br/>Oh, no. Explain to me why. <br/>Well, with the way things are going with the other  tribe... and the alliances that have been made over there, it's a stronger,  more secure play. <br/>I don't understand, like, how everything switched so  drastically. I mean, is it because Amber gave up some information or...? <br/>There's some information that was passed to me by Rob...  at the challenge. <br/>Boston Rob will tell you anything to keep Amber around. It's so obvious. He will say anything. He's got the hots for her, and they've got some sort of thing  going on. He will stab you in the back the second he gets the chance. Please reconsider, Lex. You're giving up somebody who has your back to the very end,  and... that right there is priceless. <br/>Let me... let me think some more. I mean, I... I don't believe in ever making a decision without  thinking about stuff, so... This is when the game really... takes a turn and  changes... when you have to start making really hard decisions. <br/>What happened? <br/>We're trying to hash this out. <br/>Yeah, Jerri's just pleading her case. So, we just want to make sure before we blip somebody off into  the stratosphere. <br/>That we're thinking about everything. <br/>Yeah. <br/>All the options for all of us. <br/>All the options when we get over there. <br/>We probably shouldn't have told her. <br/>Oh, no, you had to. <br/>No, no, no...  No, I mean, I'm glad we did, but now...  'Cause it's making us think of things we hadn't thought  about. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay. <br/>So, we're going to Tribal Council, and no matter what  decision we make, nights like tonight are just, uh... miserable. <br/>Probst: Hello, guys. Let's talk about the past few days. We brought both tribes together, the idea being, we would  shuffle the tribes. The former Mogo Mogo stayed completely together. The only thing that changed is you gained a member. Two big events really transpired when this went down. First one was, you got a new home. Kathy? <br/>Oh! [scoffs] I mean, you know, it's a four-star hotel, you know? We're coming from the 3-M Motel over on Mogo Mogo, so it's so  much better. And you know, I mean, I was embarrassed that we didn't go a  little further with our camp for those poor guys. But no, it's great! I mean, we couldn't be happier. And can you see you get stronger. <br/>Probst: The other big result of this tribe shuffle was one  person shuffled, and that was you, Amber. And the look on your face...  Yeah, I was extremely upset. It was... it was impossible to hide. And that first night, it was really hard. But I woke up the next morning and told myself, "It's a new  day, and so, I'm not going to let myself get down." I had one down  night, and that next morning I woke up, and I was a new tribe. <br/>Probst: So, just like that, the loyalty you had with  Boston Rob and Big Tom and everybody else on your old tribe is gone? <br/>I can't make any guesses what's going to happen in this  game, so I have to play with my new members, and these are my new tribe  members. <br/>Probst: Shii Ann, it's got to be a little hard to trust  that. Obviously, odd person out. So, when she says, "Hey, I'm with you guys," what's  the part of you going, "Hmm, I don't know?"  I mean, it would be silly to think her, you know, 20  some-odd days with those guys is just erased by the last three days. But she's a member of Chapera, just like the rest of us, and  trust is something that is built one day at a time here. <br/>Probst: Jerri, this was a reunion for you. <br/>Yeah. I was just like, "Oh, my Outback sister, she's back with  me!" you know? It was... it was very exciting, but I also realized that it's a  totally different game. Everyone has come into this game with different personalities  and with different goals. <br/>Probst: Lex, in a way, was it nice to get Amber? Because really, your tribe could stay intact, and you could get  rid of the opposition, after having come to a Tribal Council. <br/>I'd be lying if I said it was any other way. And I think that, you know, that's just a harsh reality of the  game. But we all know the game has so many twists and turns, it ain't  over until it's over. <br/>Probst: Amber, if it's you tonight...  If it's me tonight, I know that I went out trying as hard  as I possibly could not to go. So, if I'm leaving tonight, I'm leaving tonight fighting hard to  stay in. <br/>Probst: It is time to vote. Lex, you're up. <br/>Amber, I'm very proud of the Lex, you're up. <br/>Amber, I'm very proud of the way you're playing this game. You did go down fighting. <br/>It's crazy that it's come down to me voting you out to  keep myself in this game. I owe you a huge thanks for that. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Jerri. Amber. One vote Amber, one vote Jerri. Jerri. That's two votes Jerri, one vote Amber. Ninth person voted out of Survivor: All-Stars... Jerri. That's three votes. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>I just want you guys to know, it's been an honor playing  this game with you. Thank you. [chuckling]: I'm going to go eat some chocolate. <br/>Probst: Jerri, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Well, tonight's Tribal Council proved something once again. It ain't over till it's over. Grab your torches. Go back to camp.

I made an alliance with Alicia, and now I've got one with  everyone. <br/>Probst: ...and goes back on his word. <br/>I'm sorry you feel that way. I really, truly am. <br/>This has truly been, again, a life-changing experience. I think I've done the impossible. I have found a way to find peace in a very stressful situation,  and now I'm ready to go out into the world and see what other craziness I can  conquer.
