<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: Deep in the heart of Africa, two tribes  have been battling. Nobody on the Fang goal! How does that happen? Kota, the yellow tribe, has won six out of eight challenges and lives very  well. <br/>Life is good. <br/>The rich are definitely getting richer here at Kota. <br/>Probst: Fang, the red tribe, has struggled with everything, and squandered  most of their food. <br/>It's the Goof Troop. It's ridiculous. <br/>Probst: At Fang, Ace and Sugar were tight with each other and no one else. And Sugar had the hidden immunity idol. <br/>I trust you. <br/>Probst: So when the rest of Fang discovered the idol, they agreed that Sugar  and Ace were the next to go. <br/>See ya, beeyotch. <br/>Probst: The two outsiders got a temporary reprieve when GC got tired of the  game and said he couldn't go on. <br/>He came up to me and said that he's just done with this. He's had enough. <br/>Probst: The tribe saw his weakness and voted him out. GC, the tribe has spoken. Can Fang turn it around? And can Ace and Sugar survive another Tribal Council? 13 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? (metal striking repeatedly)  Nice! <br/>Yay, Matty! <br/>Ah, I'm so happy. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>It's just, like, positive energy now; we're all positive. Nobody is dragging. <br/>You know, tonight was particularly hard. <br/>Yeah, tonight was hard. <br/>Tribal Council is sad. You know, not unexpected. Um... GC had to go. I've got Sugar in my pocket, and I need to try and arrange something that I  can save myself until merge. I just don't know who would be my potential Benedict Arnold. <br/>(sings indistinctly)  Good morning. <br/>How'd you sleep? <br/>Not very good. I was, like, up all night. <br/>That's crazy, dude. <br/>I know what means the most to me in my life. Every night I dream about food, my dog, and my girlfriend. Every night. This is by far the hardest thing I've ever done. But... my whole driving force out here is Jamie-- she's my girlfriend-- so  I'm trying to make some sort of ring-type thing. It's just something to keep myself reminded of her. Because of her, I want to finish this out to the end. I'm in a terrible position, and I feel like I've been in a bad position the  moment this game started with Fang. If somebody approached me with a legitimate, logical, reasonable plan that  might work, for sure I'm on board, man. I am jumping on board and I'm flying with it. * Come over here. What do you think? <br/>I'm just stressed, man. <br/>Why? <br/>Man, I just want to make it as far as possible, you know? <br/>You know, I just... I prefer not to be blindsided. <br/>It all just depends on how close everyone is, you know? I mean, you want to keep Kenny around? Or Crystal, and all them? <br/>Kenny. <br/>I mean, I-I don't really want Sugar to go. You've got your Kenny, I've...  That's fine. Okay, that's cool. That's the deal. <br/>Deal? <br/>Deal. I got my Kenny, and you got your Sugar. <br/>Until merge, you're... on your girl, you're not gonna stab me in the back. <br/>Okay. <br/>I'll... I can guarantee I'm with you. <br/>Okay, what do you have to put it on, then? <br/>My mother's life. <br/>Your mother's life that you're gonna get me to...  Yeah, same as your girl's. <br/>Okay, I'll put it on my girl, then. <br/>Okay? <br/>All right. <br/>I mean, that's huge. My mother's my best friend. <br/>My girl's my everything. I think Ace and I are probably some of the top competitors out here  physically, and I do like him on my side, and... I made a pact with Ace that  I can't break, and I promised on my girlfriend, which is the love of my life. She's my driving force out here, and I'm not gonna break that promise for a  million dollars. Not for $5 million. (theme song playing) Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION  * * (elephant trumpeting)  I know I look like Oliver, but... sorry. <br/>What's on that menu? <br/>Don't drink, or drink at your own risk. <br/>That's the sushi plate? <br/>Randy. Are you gonna eat off this one? <br/>Yeah. <br/>We might have to share together, Bob. <br/>Yep. It works. We've been eating very well, and when we got spices and salt, we started  eating quite a bit. But Dan was shoveling it on with a spoon, and I realized when I served Susie  and I, I put the same number of scoops on my plate for Susie and I to share  as Dan put on for himself. <br/>It doesn't matter if you weigh a hundred pounds more than me, you've still  got the same, like, proportion of food. But Dan's decided that he deserves fourth and fifth servings of food. (indistinct chatter) So now we are going through food at an alarming rate,  and he takes... multiple servings. I'm sick about how much food is being wasted on him. (frustrated grunt) *  Well, what do you guys think? You think there's enough rice to get through nine days? <br/>Here's the thing. We could do two small. Say you want... or one big one later? <br/>So whatever you guys think, man. That's better for digestion: we get two small meals. <br/>Cooking small, it's not that good 'cause a lot of it sticks to the side. <br/>I agree. <br/>Starting on day one, I was talking about how everybody does not reserve the  right to just eating it raw and... and just spilling it all over the place,  and now, of course, we have a shortage of rice. We have about six days' worth. If we don't have rice, we're dead. Basically, we're gone. It's hard for our tribe right now. It's, like, we're at rock bottom. <br/>Hello there. <br/>Hello. <br/>Why? <br/>Yeah. Um... Right? I was trying to hang on to my idol as long as possible, but Ace came and told  me that he thinks they've gone through my bag and found it. So I gave it to Ace for safekeeping. Ace is now in possession of the idol. He's got it in his pocket. I'm really putting a lot of faith in Ace right now. Ace is kind of a snake, but he's my snake, and I'm glad to have him. <br/>It's been a crazy couple of days. It went from me being in a position of no power to a position of supremacy,  having the immunity idol in my pocket. I have Matty's word. I have Sugar. I feel like I've put myself in a very good position, coming from a tribe that  I didn't have any alliance with. And now suddenly, you know, I've got people there. (elephant trumpets) Oh, my God, this is amazing. I just turned around and there's an elephant swimming through the water. Oh, how beautiful. I guess that's one way to get from one side to the other. (trumpeting) *  Probst: Come on in, guys! Kota getting your first look at the new Fang tribe. <br/>(whispers): Jeez... God. <br/>Probst: GC voted out at the last Tribal Council. All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, each tribe will be tethered to a 20-foot-long,  200-pound snake. You will start on opposite sides of the course. On my "go," you will race around the course attempting to catch the  other tribe. If along the way you get tired and become a liability, you can opt out of the  challenge by simply disconnecting from the snake. That will force the rest of your tribe to pick up that extra weight. First tribe to catch the other tribe and touch one tribe member wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. Absolutely. <br/>Probst: I think you're gonna like it. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: Croissants, fruit tarts, chocolate Ã    clairs,  plus everything you need to make a nice cup of coffee... or a hot pot of tea. In addition, the winning tribe'll send one member of the losing tribe to  Exile Island. Worth playing for? <br/>Yeah. Yes. <br/>Probst: Kota, you have one extra member, sitting somebody out, keeping in  mind you cannot sit out the same person in back-to-back challenges. <br/>I'll sit out. <br/>Probst: Corinne's gonna sit this one out. Corinne, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. <br/>Probst: Here we go. For reward. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, Kota. <br/>Probst: Huge reward on the line. This challenge is going to be won by the tribe that wants it the most. <br/>They're turning the corner. They've got a few steps on us. <br/>We're gaining on them, guys. Come on. <br/>Keep this pace. Keep this pace. <br/>Take it easy. <br/>Come on, Kota! You guys got this. <br/>Probst: Fang gets an early lead off the start. <br/>We're all right. <br/>All right, downhill here. Go. Let's go. <br/>Probst: Think about those pastries, that hot cup of coffee. It would be nice to wake up to some of that. <br/>Keep it up, Kelly. <br/>Probst: Kelly barely moving. <br/>Kelly, they're catching up. <br/>I'm coming. <br/>Probst: Kota now gaining on Fang after one lap of this course. You're going to get tired. You're going to want to quit. Every time somebody drops out, you put a bigger burden on the rest of your  tribe. <br/>If you got to drop, drop. Then we'll move. <br/>Kota gaining more ground on Fang. <br/>All right, guys. Here we go. <br/>Come on! <br/>We've got to speed up. <br/>We got to move! <br/>Probst: Kota continues to make up ground. <br/>We're gaining on them. <br/>Probst: Fang is fading very quickly. <br/>Drop half the people and we sprint. Go. Just get off. <br/>Okay. <br/>Sugar, go. Kenny, go. <br/>Run! <br/>Probst: Sugar and Kenny both drop out, and that seems to help Fang. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Probst: They're now moving much more quickly. <br/>Put 'em down right now. <br/>Go, Kelly. Get out of here. Just unhook. <br/>Probst: Kelly has now dropped out. <br/>Let's do this! <br/>Probst: Fang is down to three members. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Probst: Susie drops out for Kota. Fang now getting some distance on Kota now that they've lost Kenny and Sugar  and Kelly. <br/>I'm getting tired. <br/>Probst: Crystal is starting to drag now. <br/>They're dragging. Come on! <br/>Probst: Matty pushing her. Frustrated. <br/>Crystal, just drop out if you can't do it! <br/>Probst: Crystal now drops out. <br/>I can't take all that weight, Matty. <br/>Come on. Let's go! <br/>Probst: It's all on Matty and Ace. Big opening for Kota now. <br/>Yeah, you've got this! <br/>Probst: Kota with five strong guys going up against Matty and Ace, who are  struggling. <br/>Come on the side of me! Come on the side of me, man! (grunting) Come on, grab it! <br/>Probst: Matty carrying half that snake himself. Ace dragging the other half. Ace trying to keep his pants up! Kota closing in on a big win and a huge reward. <br/>Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! <br/>Probst: Kota wins reward. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Not even close. Not even close. Nice. <br/>You all right, Bob? <br/>Oh, God. <br/>If I can do it at your age...  Probst: Kota, congratulations. This reward has enough for you to sample a little now and still have plenty  to take back to camp. <br/>Can you share? <br/>Can we have one? <br/>Uh, no. <br/>Everyone grab one of these. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Ooh, I want some strawberries. <br/>Mmm! <br/>Crystal, what hurts more, losing or seeing this tempting array of food in  front of you and knowing you can't have it? <br/>Losing over and over. (sniffles) It's starting to hurt. <br/>Probst: Something you're not used to. <br/>No. <br/>Waah, waah, waah! <br/>Probst: All right, Kota, who are you going to send from Fang to Exile Island? <br/>Sugar. <br/>Probst: Sugar, for the fourth time, you'll be sent to Exile Island. Sugar, you will return in time for the next immunity challenge. Fang, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>I love winning challenges. More importantly than winning challenges, I absolutely love watching them  lose. <br/>Probst: Kota, congratulations. Come get your reward. <br/>Randy? To me, he's just... He's a troll. He's a troll under the bridge that's just mean and angry with the world. I don't play like that. Do not disrespect me like that. I have a feeling that in the event there's a merge, that old Fang and new  Fang won't get along. <br/>No pun intended, but sweet. <br/>Today's challenge just showed that Kota is a strong, unified team. And I'm so excited to see that. I mean, when it works like a charm in the challenges, there's just no better  feeling. <br/>I think we need a table to sit down and have breakfast at. <br/>Has anyone thought about how we want to split this up? <br/>Charlie had a great idea. Split it up, and each individual person can just eat their share as they want. <br/>Well, I know that, um, there are definitely seven croissants and there's  seven of these jelly things. <br/>Okay. <br/>And then we could figure out how many's in the middle. <br/>So, if someone doesn't want an eclair, they can get an extra one of these. If someone doesn't want a Cinnabon, they can get one of those. <br/>If it wasn't for Dan, we wouldn't have rationing laws, so when the pastries  came back, like, the old Kota members like me, Marcus, and Charlie are  already like, "How are we going to divide this?" So we tried to  make it as fair as possible. <br/>This will be...  This should just be gravy. <br/>What do you mean gravy? <br/>Extra. Go with the original plan, which was cook dinner and, um, you know, this is  just...  Yeah, 'cause that will give us one more meal on the back end. <br/>Exactly. <br/>That's why it's a good idea. <br/>I don't want to be hungry come midnight. <br/>Dan, he has annoyed everybody. He's even annoyed me a little bit. <br/>This is so good. I can't stop. <br/>Yeah, it does. It feels so good when it hits my lips. <br/>My best move might be to just kind of slowly distance myself from Dan as I  bring myself closer to the original Kota. <br/>God, those pastries are good. <br/>Go for it. <br/>If I take one bite, I only have one and a half left. <br/>It's a reward. There's no rationing. <br/>Don't do that. <br/>I knew that they were probably going to send me back to Exile. This is lame. Why-why... Why do I get to come back here and... Eat fruit when everybody is  starving at my tribe, and they're running out of food, and they don't have  anything but rice. And I'm feeling really guilty. I just feel bad knowing that I already have the idol. Actually, I gave Ace the idol in case he needs it before Tribal, but... Well,  we'll see if that happens. <br/>I wouldn't mind getting some more of the fruit. <br/>Hey, this is my opinion. Today it's super mellow out. <br/>Re-hydrate. <br/>Tomorrow we're going to have a big day, and it's probably going to be super  hot. So we might as well get everything done today, get all the canteens filled. <br/>I don't know why you're stressing over it. <br/>I'm not stressing. <br/>Yes, you are. <br/>Fang lost another challenge. We needed that food because I'm, like, withering away, and we have, like,  three scoops of rice. And then, Crystal's reaction of our loss was huge. She just, like, broke down in tears. Personally, I just think her personality sucks. <br/>I know. Like, seriously, that all just, like, sucks. It's like a damper on the team. Like, you don't need to cry, right? <br/>Well, it's just a different sort of cry than uh... Sugar's cry is more a...  Emotional. <br/>Emotional, I'm happy to be here. <br/>Right. <br/>Don't view my tears at today's challenge as a sign of weakness. Because it's far from that. You and Kelly view me as weak now because I was crying? <br/>Not weak. <br/>Where did they go, up by the hill or they went by tree mail? <br/>By tree mail and by the hill. <br/>I hope that they don't put me in the same category as GC, someone that wants  to give up. Because shortly after I got back to camp, I snapped out of my funk. But Kelly hasn't had two words to say to me, and so now she's going to feel  the wrath of Crystal. <br/>Hey, how did you get here? <br/>Same way you got here. <br/>Really? <br/>She walked. <br/>Are you feeling better? <br/>Yeah, I mean, y'all have already had the comforts of food. I mean, you guys have had fish. I've had a pinch of a freaking sardine. You know what I'm saying? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>But, like I tell you and like I tell everybody else in my tribe: don't  mistake my tears as a sign of weakness because at some point, we all get  depressed. It's just that mine come out through my eyes, you know. I mean, I think I can still battle with the best of them and just don't  mistake it as a sign of weakness because it's not. But I'm fine now. <br/>I definitely think that Crystal crying in front of the Kota tribe and our  tribe, it shows a sign of weakness. Like, you could take it either which way, you know. Like, she can explain it to us, but she can't explain it to the Kota tribe. <br/>I think more so with me, it wasn't the danish, it was the pride. <br/>It just sucks, especially when you lose, and we lose every time. <br/>Marcus. A giant turtle. <br/>A giant turtle? <br/>Not giant, but big enough. <br/>Okay, hold on, hold on. Hold on. Let me give you my shirt or something. Untie me. I'll bring the boat around. <br/>Your hands are too important. Hold on. <br/>Listen to me. I don't want you to lose your hand. <br/>It doesn't matter. It's food. <br/>Whoo! <br/>All right, we've got a turtle! I was really excited because it was like winning a reward challenge, except  we did it ourselves, so it had that extra bit of joy to it. <br/>That is neat. <br/>You know... You know how to cook that, right? <br/>That's good size. <br/>Kill it and then crack the shell, break it out, and cut it in cubes and boil  it. <br/>Wow. <br/>Go for it. I'm excited about it. I think it's going to taste good. Have you ever had gumbo turtle soup here in the jungles of Africa? How cool is that? <br/>It's going to be delish. I know it. <br/>That's delicious. <br/>That is so good. Mmm. <br/>I can't complain. <br/>Right now, the Kota tribe is probably at our highest high. The fact that we caught a turtle has just knocked us up ten notches. Fang better watch out. <br/>(muffled): I love it. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. We'll now bring in Sugar, returning from Exile Island. <br/>Howdy. <br/>Hi. <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: First things first. You're hiding it back there, Charlie. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, each tribe will divide into three pairs. Each pair will be tethered together by rope. On my go, the first pair will crawl under a cargo net, race into the jungle,  navigate an obstacle and retrieve two sections of a flagpole, then race back. Then the next pair goes. Each leg of the challenge adds another obstacle, making it more difficult. First tribe to collect all three pairs of flagpole pieces and assemble it  correctly wins immunity. Safe at least one more day in this game. Losers, Tribal Council, somebody going home. Make sense? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Kota, you have one extra member. You're going to have to sit somebody out. Who's it going to be? Susie, you're going to sit this one out? <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: Take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to pair up, and we'll get started. Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready? Go! Bob and Randy for Kota and Kelly and Sugar for Fang. <br/>Nice, Sugar, nice, Kelly! <br/>Probst: Kelly and Sugar getting through the course quickly. Randy dragging it for Kota. Fang looking strong. Sugar against Bob on the ropes. Who's going to have the most nimble fingers, get that first flag sections? Bob has their flagpole sections down. Sugar has hers down! Got to unclip and get back. Randy and Bob heading out. Kelly and Sugar right behind. <br/>Let's go, guys. <br/>Come on. Hustle it out! <br/>Halfway there, come on! <br/>Go, you got it! <br/>Probst: Bob and Randy are back through the crawl-through first. <br/>Come on! Come on! <br/>Probst: Let's go, girls! What are you doing? Fang slowing down. <br/>Come on. You got it! <br/>Probst: Bob and Randy with a bit of a lead for Kota now. <br/>Come on! Come on! <br/>Hustle! Go! Go! <br/>Probst: Gotta get back to the mat before the next pair can go. Corinne and Charlie on the court. Kelly and Sugar are losing a tremendous amount of time for Fang. Kelly is dragging. <br/>Nice! <br/>Probst: Charlie and Corinne through the crawl-through. Ace and Crystal out on the course for Fang. <br/>Come on, baby! <br/>Probst: Kota now at the second obstacle. Fang finishing up the first. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Probst: Charlie and Corinne make quick work of it. Crystal and Ace trying to catch up. <br/>Come on! Let's go. Come on! <br/>Probst: Corinne whipping through the knots for Kota. <br/>Get out of the way. <br/>Probst: Corinne has the second set of flagpole pieces released. Ace trying to pick it up for Fang. Ace has them undone. Got to unclip. <br/>Do it... oh, that hurt! It's all right. <br/>Probst: Charlie and Corinne with a decent lead for Kota. <br/>Come on! <br/>All right, guys! 20 yards! <br/>Probst: Charlie and Corinne moving through the crawl. Ace and Crystal have made up a lot of time for Fang. Fang gaining on Kota. That lead is evaporating now. Corrine and Charlie are back. The final two for Kota. It's Dan and Marcus. <br/>Go! <br/>Probst: Fang's back. The final two for Fang: Matty and Kenny. Matty throwing himself. Matty and Kenny quickly through the crawl-through. <br/>Come on, buddy! Come on! You okay? Come on. <br/>Probst: Dan and Marcus at the second obstacle for Kota. Matty and Kenny right on their tail. Dan and Marcus now at the third obstacle. Matty and Kenny right there. They're going to pass Kota now, climbing over the obstacle. Matty and Kenny have overtaken Marcus and Dan! Fang now in the lead. Matty and Kenny unbelievable in this leg. Kenny has the pieces to the flagpole down. Dan has them down. Matty and Kenny heading back with the final two pieces to that flagpole. Dan and Marcus right behind. They're going on top of the challenge. Fang through first. Kota right behind. <br/>Come on! Come on! <br/>Probst: Fang still with the lead on Kota. We are neck and neck! Matty and Kenny made up a lot of time. Got to get back to the mat. Then you can start work working on the flagpole. Get back, Kenny. You got to get back! <br/>Get up! <br/>Come on, Kenny! <br/>Probst: Go! Gotta untie all six pieces first. Then you start working on assembling it. <br/>That's not it! That's not it! <br/>Probst: This is where teamwork is going to win or lose this challenge. Kota working together very well. <br/>Get out of the way! <br/>Probst: Ace not wanting help from anyone. After coming so close, Fang now falling behind. Ace trying to muscle it in. All the pieces will interlock. You don't need to force anything. Kota quickly working together on assembling their flagpole. <br/>It's not going in! <br/>Probst: Ace still struggling to make sense of this. (cheering) Kota wins immunity once again! <br/>Good job, guys! <br/>Yes! <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Kota, once again, immunity is yours. Kota, not much to say. You continue to dominate in this game. Enjoy it. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Probst: And Fang, once again, Tribal Council, all yours. And if you continue to play like individuals, you'll be there every time. Tonight, one of the six of you going home. You have the afternoon to figure out who it's going to be. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>Ace is a tyrant and a bully and a lot of people see Ace as a strong  competitor, but he's been in our tribe for three or four challenges now, and  we haven't won anything. So, how is he benefiting me? *  The challenge was challenging. There were a couple of people that died right at the end. I was expecting more from Kelly, and she really just sort of petered out. She goes, it strengthens the team, and I think she's just irritating and  really dumb. Kelly's going home tonight. It would be stupid not to send her. <br/>All right, don't get mad at me when I say this, but, uh, if we, if we merge  at nine...  Yeah. <br/>And we go into the last three ,and it's going to be you, Sugar or me, she can  play the idol and I can leave, dude. I think we should flush the idol tonight. You and I and her, that's too much of a risk. Why can't we play it tonight? <br/>Matty, look at me. She can't play the idol. Trust me. <br/>If it's us three...  Trust me. <br/>Okay, all right, I trust you then. <br/>Matty wanted to get the idol out and I just tried to convey to him that he  doesn't really have to worry about that to that extent because although I  don't want to tell him I have the idol; obviously, I do. Man, don't worry about the idol. I promise we'll take care of it. <br/>All right. Kelly, then. <br/>Kelly. <br/>Okay. <br/>The alliance is sound. I would hope to trust Matty. Sugar I pretty much trust completely. I don't see any reason why Kenny would not go with what it is, and I think it  makes sense for everyone to get rid of Kelly. <br/>Why not? <br/>Because it's not going to work. That's what I tried to run by Ace right when I got here. <br/>Why do you trust Ace? <br/>Who said I did? <br/>Well, then, when you went to talk to him in the woods, what did you ask him? What did he say? <br/>He said, "Kelly." "Kelly." I said, "I guess. That sound good to me, dude."  I really want Ace out of here. <br/>We can't vote Ace off. We have to win a freaking immunity...  Have you won one yet since he's been here? Okay. <br/>I don't know what's going through Matty's head. He's running and telling Ace everything and Ace ain't running and telling him  anything. <br/>Let's just get out Kelly. I don't know why we have to get... Let's just start with this. <br/>Okay. I'm still very leery of Ace and Sugar because they are in an alliance, and  Kenny, myself, and Matty, we have to be leery of everything that's going on  around us. <br/>Something is up tonight. <br/>Matty...  No, no. <br/>He's just riding the fence. <br/>Right now, the safest best is to write down Kelly. <br/>Ace is probably writing down Kelly. Sugar is writing down Kelly. <br/>Matty is writing down Kelly. <br/>Matty is writing down Kelly. Right now, I'm really torn 'cause I really want Ace out of here. <br/>Do we trust Ace or Kelly? I don't trust Ace. <br/>I don't trust Ace. <br/>Crystal knows something's up, and she does not trust Matty. Crystal is on to something. Right now, know what Crystal told me? She told me that, "Yeah, I'm worried about Matty, that he's  flipping." And I'm like, "Don't worry. We're sticking together." Crystal said, "Okay."  All that we have to know is that Kelly goes next. That's it. That's all we have to know right now. <br/>Or blindside Ace. <br/>I can't. I made a promise that I can't break. <br/>Yeah, but, man, you can't trust someone like that when they say they have an  agreement. <br/>We made a serious agreement. He swore on his mother. <br/>You got to think it over. Matty, like, you just can't take anybody's word. In order for you and me to guarantee to make the merge, we have to blindside  Ace and then that's a guaranteed merge for you and me. I don't trust Ace at all. I know he's sneaky. I know he has alliances back in the Kota tribe. And Sugar's going to go with Ace no matter what. So I was like, I had to talk to Sugar on a one-on-one basis. It's weird 'cause his game, you see people who are really honest and sweet,  kind of get, like, their heads chopped off by people like...  That's why I connected with Ace. <br/>By people like...  Ace. <br/>Ace. (laughs) So I figured, you know, maybe we could stick together. <br/>I know. I know, huh? <br/>I was so shocked today when Sugar told me that she gave the hidden immunity  idol to Ace. And I was like, "Wait. What?!" Since you gave the idol to Ace, that just shows that you he is...   Well, he didn't ask for it. I gave it to him. <br/>You just gave it to him on your own will. <br/>Yeah. He didn't, like, talk me out of it or anything, but I know Ace is a sneak. <br/>Yeah, he's very sleazy. <br/>I just wanted to let you know that they took the idol out of your bag-- I  mean, out of your jacket-- so you don't think that somebody else did it. <br/>Oh, okay. <br/>But I don't think I need to play it, right? <br/>No. <br/>You're sure I'm good? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay, cool. <br/>All right. <br/>All right. <br/>I told Sugar, "Always keep the idol with you, you know. In case something happens." I just made sure that it's not in the  snake's hands, Ace's hands and it's back to Sugar's hands. <br/>Uh, the deal with Sugar and the idol is she has it, and I think it's quite  possible Sugar thinks "I've used Ace to the extent that I can." I'm  not particularly worried in relation to my own regard at the moment. I'm going in confident. That could be the worst thing possible. (Probst sighs)  Probst: So, out of ten challenges, you have won two. Matty, what is the mood of this tribe? <br/>We're... cursed. (laughing) There's something in our water. There's something in our rice. But I think we have a curse. <br/>Probst: Kelly, what's your take on this tribe? <br/>Um, we just can't come, like, as a team, and just, like, work together. <br/>Probst: I think Kelly hit it on the head. What I saw today at the challenge is a group of people working as individuals. <br/>Jeff, when it came to putting that flag and pole together, I really, honestly  felt like Ace wanted to be the person to put it all together. "We got to try this." We got to try this." I'm like, "We  can all piece it together."  Probst: Ace, do you think you guys were effective in how you were working at  the end, trying to put that flag together? <br/>No, we didn't come together as a group. And I think I can apportion definitely a larger percentage of the blame for  how it went together at the end. <br/>Probst: Crystal, would it be fair to give Ace a vote, simply because you  thought you knew how to do it, and you didn't? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Surprise you, Ace? <br/>Nothing surprises me in Tribal Council, honestly. <br/>Probst: Crystal, you've been upset at a lot of challenges. Tears have come out often. Do you think it's starting to have an impact? <br/>Oh, definitely. Some of my tribemates tend to take it as weakness and will very well use it  against me tonight. <br/>Probst: Kelly, you're nodding your head. <br/>Um, I never said she was weak, but when somebody cries, it's just like,  "Why are you crying?" Clearly something is, like, you're just not  stable. <br/>You don't know where my tears come from. Yeah, I'm hurt because we're losing. We're not eating. We're not winning. And if you don't understand that, you won't last too much longer in the game  yourself. <br/>Okay...  And you took me crying one time as a sign of weakness? I don't think so. <br/>Okay, well, I didn't say that you were weak, so you can take what you want. <br/>Next question, please. <br/>Probst: Now, Kelly didn't say you were weak. Kelly said you were unstable. <br/>Yeah, that's worse. <br/>She didn't explain to us why she was crying. I asked is her afterwards if she was okay. She told me... You don't have to explain. It's understood. And sometimes you don't have to have things written out in black and white. I'm not crying over no doggone danishes, okay? Really, it gets frustrating, Kelly; it really does. We've been down and out from day one. But you wouldn't understand it because you came from a a winning situation. <br/>I'm not banging her down. Like, I just saw her cry. That doesn't mean anything. I wasn't the only one talking about it. Ace talked about it...  Whoa, before you start to try and throw people under busses for no apparent  reason, the only thing I said about Crystal was I actually understood because  it's frustrating losing over and over again, just so it drives you up the  wall. <br/>Probst: Kelly, the whole time Ace was talking, you had a look on your face  like, "Not true."  He is 100% double-talking and it's just just so annoying, I just, like, don't  even know how to explain it. <br/>Honestly, Kelly, I would be impressed if you understood what I was saying  half the time. <br/>He always has to have the last word. It's disgusting. <br/>Probst: Matty, you seem like one of the few guys tonight who might have  reason to actually not be worried. <br/>There's no sort of semblance or logic in this tribe, though. <br/>Probst: That must be maddening when you get to the vote. There are so many people, tonight, it feels like, that are on the chopping  block. <br/>It could be any one of us. It really could be any single one of us tonight. <br/>Probst: Well, it sounds like it's going to be an interesting vote. It is time to vote. Ace, you're up. <br/>My dear, this has been a been a long time in the coming. Hopefully, it happens tonight. <br/>Forget you. Go home. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Kelly. Crystal. One vote Kelly; one vote Crystal. Kelly. Two votes Kelly; one vote Crystal. Kelly. That's three votes Kelly; one vote Crystal. Sixth person voted out of Survivor: Gabon: Kelly. That's four. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Kelly, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Well, tonight was the first Tribal Council that I saw some true passion. Maybe that's what's been missing. Time will tell. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

She doesn't really have the power to push a team when she's the one quitting  half the challenges. I think the Fang tribe is still cursed. I think they're still going to go down. They need to work together. Maybe tonight's Tribal Council, they'll communicate better, but I definitely  wanted to stay in the game, but, you know, if it's my time to go, it's my  time to go.
