<br/> Jeff: Previously on Survivor:  Sash and Brenda were king and queen of the beach. <br/>We're the two most powerful  people in this game. <br/>Jeff: And they  thought everyone else was a peasant. <br/>People need to  remember where their place is. <br/>Jeff: Their alliance  was strengthened by two hidden immunity idols. Brenda's best friend NaOnka had one... It's the key to our  life in the game. <br/>Jeff: ...And Sash had  the other. But some of the peasants were getting restless. <br/>There is a temptation  to want to suddenly just take control and make a move. Whoo! <br/>Yeah, Marty! <br/>Jeff: So at the  reward feast, Marty succumbed to temptation and tried to launch an all-guys  rebellion. <br/>We're taking this  thing to the end, men. <br/>We earned it! <br/>Nice job today, man. <br/>Jeff: Fabio and Benry  immediately jumped on board. <br/>Marty's a smart guy. He knows what he's doing. <br/>Jeff: Sash fooled Marty  by pretending to join up with him. <br/>I tried to boost his  ego so that he'll continue to come back to me. <br/>Jeff: Marty didn't  approach Chase because he was too close with Brenda and Jane. <br/>I wanted to show the  girls they can trust me, and hopefully that will get me further in the game. <br/>Jeff: At tribal  council, Brenda and Sash squashed Marty's plan... Marty, the tribe has spoken. ...And Marty along with him. Now Brenda and Sash have so much power that everyone is looking over their  shoulder. Ten are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Tribal council really  showed where the allegiance really is. Benry, Fabio, and Dan now see that Sash and I aren't on their side. And we took out their little leader Marty. And now it's only a matter of time before they go. I'm gonna get a good night's sleep tonight. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>I think Sash and I  being in control does look like a king and-queen situation. But Sash is more of a queen and I'm more of a king is the way I look at it. <br/>I know. <br/>Jane and I both had  the same feeling: Brenda is basically calling all the shots. So we are totally gonna make a power move before next tribal. I mean, seriously, what do I have to lose? Something has to change, and it has to change soon. Âª This rain is bad, man. The elements out here can really get you. This morning, we woke up, and it looked like it was gonna rain. We all know that it's important that the fire at least stays going. So we moved, like, all of the chests around the fire to protect it from the  rain. That's important. <br/>I got up three times  in the middle of the night, and I was gonna wake you up, and then I didn't. <br/>I've come a long way  in this game. Day five, I was ready to leave, and here I am, sitting here with 14 days left. I'm, like, "My gosh. I could really keep going." so right now, Jane and I, we're trying to  rally a vote against Brenda or Sash. <br/>What happened last  night? <br/>Sash and Brenda told  you guys they were voting for Jane. <br/>Right. <br/>And they switched,  and they voted for Marty. They are in total control. <br/>Sash just backstabbed  him last night. <br/>Terribly! <br/>Terribly. <br/>So how can you trust Brenda  and Sash when what they did at tribal last night? <br/>I can't. <br/>Everybody's listening  to Brenda, including me. Kelly purple crawls up Brenda's ... She does exactly what she wants to do. Brenda is also another threat because she's really good at challenges. And she's gonna take you guys out one by one. <br/>Holly absolutely gave  me a little bit of a wake-up call this morning. She's got a great plan, actually. And I'm all for it, you know? Getting rid of Sash and Brenda is number one on my list right now. <br/>Brenda's the queen  bee and knows this game in and out. She must have been studying this forever. <br/>Brenda is playing  this game so well to where she's over-thinking. She's Marty, jr. She's become a villain. She befriends you, and then she throws you to the wolves. <br/>Brenda, she's like my  best friend out here, but did I come out here all this way from south central  l.A. To go back home with nothing? No. This is a game. And Brenda is a threat. So right now, while we have everybody against her, now is the time to get her  out. <br/>We need to see who  wins individual immunity, and then we need to decide. But I think we're all in a consensus that Brenda has to go first. She's the ringleader. <br/>Things are getting a  little crazy here at camp. There's two alliances now, and I personally think it could be the best  interest to vote Benry out first. I still don't trust Benry. Benry's on his last rope. He screwed up when he voted with Marty, plus he's a big physical threat. And as of right now, I don't think Brenda and Sash have lied to me. So I'm stuck in the middle of two alliances again. <br/>Chase, you've got to  believe me on this one. She is totally running the show. <br/>I think you're wrong. Chase was a little leery about the plan. He was a little concerned about ben. So I'm keeping my eye on Chase just because Chase, I feel I can trust him,  but at this point in the game, he makes me just a little nervous. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys! Guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>All: Yes. <br/>Jeff: For today's  challenge, you will be divided into two teams of five. Using only four barrels, two planks, and ten feet of rope, you must work  together to make your way across the beach to the finished platform without  touching the ground. If anybody from your team touches the ground, the entire team has to go back  to the start. First team to get all five members to the finish platform win reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>All: Yes! <br/>Reporter: The winning  team will travel to the cerro negro, one of the most active volcanoes in the  world. You'll do a little volcano boarding, and then you'll and enjoy pizza, soft  drinks, chocolate brownies. [all groan] Oh, my God, baby. <br/>Jeff: I know it's  worth playing for. We'll do a schoolyard pick to get our teams. We'll get started. On the blue team: Chase, Purple Kelly, Jane, NaOnka, and Fabio. On the yellow team: Sash, Holly, Brenda, Dan, and Benry. For reward. Survivors ready? Go! You have four barrels, two planks of wood, and ten feet of rope. What you do with it will determine who wins this challenge. Both teams off to a good start trying to figure out a system, what's gonna be  the key to moving the entire team of five across the beach when you can't  touch the ground? <br/>Stay low, Chase, stay  low. Stay low. <br/>Keep it close! Keep it close! <br/>Roll that to Sash. <br/>Purple kelly, can you  reach that barrel? <br/>See if you can get  your feet behind you. <br/>Where do you want me? <br/>Jeff: Blue team wants  their last barrel and can't get it. <br/>I don't think we need  it. <br/>I don't either. <br/>Let's go with it. <br/>Jeff: Dan, battling  two bad knees, gonna try to get up on this barrel. Doesn't look like it's comfortable, but he's up there. That's all that matters. Blue team has a system and it is working, only using three of their four  barrels. Yellow team just winging it. A little cirque de soleil going on with Benry. Chase has a very good strategy for the blue team. <br/>Let's do what they're  doing. We're gonna lose that fourth barrel. <br/>Jeff: Blue team  working together, very calm. Yellow team looks like they're in pain, crunched over, confused. <br/>It's rolling! It's rolling! <br/>Jeff: Yellow team,  everybody falls off. Everybody back to the start. Dan is hurt. Dan smashed his hand. Huge setback for the yellow team. The only thing the yellow team can hope for is a mistake by the blue team. Brenda trying to roll on one of the barrels. That'll work, for a minute. <br/>Here, put it between  my legs. <br/>Jeff: Yellow team has  made very little progress in this challenge. If this were life or death, you'd be dead. [Fabio laughs] Y'all stay focused. <br/>Jeff: Rain starting  to come down now. Fabio will be first to cross for the blue team. <br/>Don't jump! Don't jump! That rolls the barrel. <br/>Jeff: Benry still  can't figure it out. Fabio, Purple Kelly, Jane, NaOnka, and Chase win reward! Pizza, brownies, and volcano surfing. Benry makes the best move in the challenge for the yellow team with the  ceremonial loser dismount. <br/>Man, we weren't even  close. <br/>Jeff: Blue team,  congratulations. Here's what's going to happen. You're going to spend the afternoon doing a little volcano boarding. You will then enjoy hot pizza, chocolate brownies, and some soft drinks. Sound like a fun afternoon? <br/>Yes! <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: I forgot to  tell you how you're getting there, by helicopter. [ã    \cheers and applauseã    ] I've never been on a  helicopter! <br/>I've never been in a  helicopter and I never thought I'd even have a passport in this lifetime let  alone be in a helicopter. I'm blown away, blown away. <br/>Oh, look at this! <br/>Check this out! <br/>That's a volcano way  over there. Look at that. <br/>No way! Flying up to the volcano, it was so awesome. I don't think any of us really expected it to be that be beautiful. That is amazing. <br/>We land on this  humongous black mountain, and it was almost like you were walking on the moon. You could see steam rising up, and you could just feel the heat coming up between  you and the ground. <br/>How active do you  think this thing is? <br/>Active. <br/>At the challenge,  jeff had mentioned volcano surfing as part of the reward, so we're actually  going to be cruising down the side of this volcano, and I've never even heard  of that before. That blew my mind, dude. [indistinct yelling] Wow, man! <br/>Dude! <br/>That was crazy! <br/>Hey, I'm hanging with  the kids now. Just because I may be a little bit older than them, I'm not afraid to do this. <br/>Let's go, Jane! <br/>Go, Jane! <br/>Yeah! <br/>That was fun as crap! I loved it. I've ridden one of those electronic bulls, you know, and that's what it was  like, riding a little bull. It was an experience I'll never forget. <br/>What do you guys  think's going down at camp. <br/>I don't care. <br/>Oh, my God, guys. Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Are you serious? <br/>Everything burned. <br/>All of it? <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God, you guys. I'm going to cry. <br/>Look at the machetes. <br/>How did that happen? <br/>Not only did we lose  reward challenge, but we just got back to camp, and pretty much our entire  camp just burned down. Oh, my God. This is un-freaking-believable. We're trying to keep this damn fire going day in and day out. We left and it was raining so we created a little barricade with our three  chests, wooden chests, one of which had all the rest of our food in it. <br/>You guys, did we  really build that fire up that big? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Look how hot it was. Look how the glass melted. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>We're lucky the whole  thing didn't burn down. <br/>We lost all our  machetes. Only the blades are left. We had our flour. We had our mangos. There were a couple of tomatoes left. There was an eggplant left. That was all burned down, and now we have 10 people with a cup of rice a day. I don't know how we're going to do it. <br/>Look at the tarp. It melted. <br/>The tarp, we can--  it's okay. We'll just turn it around. <br/>This is unbelievable. <br/>Do you believe this? <br/>It's not worth  getting upset about. It's just something that we have-- it's already done. We have to clean it up. <br/>Someone should  probably wake me up and tell me that this did not happen. I mean, I guess all we can do is wrangle what we have left and keep it going. But this is a day from hell. <br/>I'm going to have a  piece of everything on this table. <br/>I can't believe it. 25 days, I haven't had chocolate. Reward was awesome! We pigged out. And I mean, everybody put stuff on their plate. I wolfed down a brownie right off the bat. Then hit the banana bread and pizza. And then I sucked down about three glasses of soda. I could have cared less what they're doing back at camp because that was  heaven. <br/>Who do you all think  is running the show? <br/>That is what's so  unclear after everything that happened yesterday. <br/>I think we should try  to get a consensus how we're feeling and how other people are feeling because  it's going to make tomorrow easier. <br/>Come here. Come here. <br/>Why did nay take him  aside. <br/>Nay does that. <br/>On the volcano. <br/>You never talk. <br/>I know, it's kind of  funny. <br/>That makes a lot of  sense, bet you didn't know that. <br/>No, that's for  real-for real. <br/>That's for real,  though. She's sneaky and she's sitting so comfortable right now cause she's just  trying to pick everybody off Naonka pulls me aside  and says we have to work together. We can get Brenda out of here. She's running the show. And I'm thinking, this is great. It just fell right into my hands and I'm totally going to milk it for all  it's worth, you know. And hopefully I can stay under the radar and slither through things. <br/>Like, I want Brenda  gone tomorrow. She wouldn't see this blind side coming at all. <br/>We can't let her hear  about it. <br/>I haven't been saying  anything. <br/>What about Chase? <br/>What about Chase? <br/>Does he want her out? <br/>He's so scatter brained. <br/>If you guys are in,  I'm going to do it. <br/>I'm in. <br/>All right. <br/>In order to win this  game, you must make power moves. You can make a big move that can shift the game in the whole other direction,  but if you make a power move, you're making a move that will push you  forward, and the more you keep making these power moves, everything's just  going to fall in line. <br/>Holly's freaking out. <br/>She's trying to  change the game up right now. <br/>Okay. <br/>When I got back from  the reward, I wanted to talk to Brenda. I just decided to come out and tell her, you know, the plan. That the others have. Well, here's what's going on. There's this plan right now to take you out. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>It's Holly that's  orchestrating it. Holly and ben, I think. For whatever reason, I trust Brenda. That's all it comes down to is I trust her and I put my game plan in her and,  you know, there is no reason or rhyme. It's just the simple fact that I trust her. You know, I've gone with my heart this entire game. There's no reason for me to turn at this point and backstab you. That would just make me look like an ass. <br/>Cool. Luckily, I have Chase, who trusts me 1,000%, and he came and told me the  whole plan. It is a challenge right now. But I still think that I don't have to do anything crazy to beat them. Like, I'm not even that impressed. <br/>What do you think  about Brenda? <br/>She's shady right now. And she has too much power right now. <br/>But I don't think  it's most important to get Brenda out right now. I think it's most important to get Benry. <br/>Whoa, I don't know  about Benry. I think it should be Brenda. <br/>Do you trust Holly? <br/>For now. <br/>I don't right now. Holly and Benry have put together this plan to vote out Brenda next. And I told Brenda that. <br/>Chase has been  running around here like a chicken with his head cut off, telling people's  game plans. Lately, he's been so scatter brained and so nervous that I have to flop. I have to be smart. I have to go with Holly and Jane. I have to go with the people who want to get the strong people out. It's the smart thing to do. We cannot trust Chase. <br/>Really? <br/>We can't. And I know that's mind blowing and it sound like I'm [ã    \bleepã     ]. Do not trust him. He's playing both in the middle. He wants you out next. <br/>Really? What do we do. <br/>We have to get Brenda  out, we have to get Sash out and then get Chase out. <br/>So you're in on this. Chase is crazy. He's been playing with mis heart and emotion this entire game since day two. He is being played by Brenda. Hopefully Chase will grow a pair and realize what's good for him. <br/>Chase is totally  against getting Brenda or Sash out. <br/>You sure about that? <br/>I am so-- Jane, look  at me. I am dead serious. You can't trust Chase right now. And he's like wigging out. <br/>I originally trusted Chase,  but Chase is sucking up to Brenda like he wants to get in her pants or  something. I have no idea what kind of magic spell she's casting over Chase right now,  but if that big old country boy wants to go back on his word, he's going to  catch hell when he gets back to carolina because carolina people don't like  that. <br/>You cannot trust Chase. <br/>I told you. <br/>You cannot. You just can't. <br/>I knew it. <br/>He's not going to  vote for Brenda. <br/>Doesn't he see that Brenda  and Sash are in total charge of this game? <br/>Yeah, he sees it but  he's stupid. <br/>What the ... Is wrong  with Chase? <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: First things  first, Brenda, I'll take it back. Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to stand on a very small platform over  the water. You'll lean back holding on to a rope. Every five minutes, you'll move your hands further down the rope, making it  more difficult. When you can't hold on any longer, you'll fall in the water, you're out of  the challenge. Last person left standing wins immunity and is guaranteed a 1-in-9 shot at a  million dollars. All right, we'll draw for spots. We'll get started. All right, everybody move your hands down to that first knot. We're looking good. This challenge is on. For immunity. And a single-digit shot at a million dollars. Just make sure you do not put your hands above that top knot. <br/>Aahh! <br/>Jeff: Purple Kelly Struggling. Sash is first in the water. Sash is first out. Followed right behind by Purple Kelly. And we are down to eight. Brenda now struggling a little. Holly in the water. Holly's third out. Dan struggling and a nice recovery. Using those guns! You worked hard for those guns! Brenda is out. Dan is out. Fabio's had enough. He releases. We are down to four. Keep digging. You do not want to go home tonight. You do not want to go to tribal council without immunity around your neck. Benry digging deep. Naonka drops out. We are down to three now. Chase, Jane, and Benry. Look at that. The oldest woman in this game going up against two of the youngest and most  fit guys, showing no signs of strain. <br/>Win one for the old  guys, janie. <br/>I'm trying, buddy. <br/>Come on, honey. <br/>Jeff: All right,  we're going to move down to the next knot. <br/>Aarrgg! Aahh! <br/>Jeff: Here we go. You have five seconds to get there. Make your move. Five, four, three, two, one. There we go. You guys are doing great. Dig deep. Right now, think only about holding on to this rope. Don't think about anything else. Keep holding on. And when you're tired, find more strength. Find something else. Go deeper. Benry is out, and we are down to two. <br/>Good job, ben. <br/>Good job, Benry. <br/>Jeff: We are down to Chase  and Jane, arguably the most fit guy out here going against the oldest woman  in this game. A great match-up. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>However you feel Jane,  but I'm staying on here. <br/>Well, my fingers are  about ready to go. <br/>I'm pretty secure. <br/>I'm gonna let go. <br/>Jeff: Why are you  going to let go? <br/>My fingers are  cramping. <br/>Come on, Jane. <br/>Jeff: Jane, dig. Don't you dare give up on this challenge! Both you guys. You've done tougher than this. Keep fighting. <br/>Hang in there, Jane. <br/>Shift your weight  around. Chase is out. Jane wins individual immunity. <br/>Good job, Jane! Good job. <br/>Jeff: You earned a  little help. <br/>Oh, crazy. <br/>I'm glad I lift  80-pound dogs. <br/>Good work. <br/>Crazy. <br/>Jeff: How close were  you to falling off? <br/>My pinkies were,  like, crushed. <br/>Jeff: You hung in  long enough to out-last Chase, immunity tonight. You're still shaking. You won't be shaking tonight at tribal council. You are safe tonight. As for the rest of you, somebody going home. Get your stuff, head back to camp. I'll see you at tribal. Good work. <br/>Man! I wanted to win so bad! And to get beat by Jane! Props to her. She's got some serious superwoman strength deep inside of her. [birds squawking] Oh. <br/>Good job, Jane. <br/>Good job, Jane. <br/>That was a lot harder  than it looked. <br/>A lot harder. <br/>Winning immunity was  great. I feel on top of the world right now. I knew if it was anything physically that had to do with my hands, I would do  okay, 'cause when you're fighting a dog trying to go their toenails, you've  got to have a real good grip, so I'm really happy right now. And I think, unless she ends up with an idol and plays it, Brenda will go  home. [hooting] Okay. Cool. So who do we target first? <br/>I mean, they're our  threats. We should probably think about taking one of them out next, right? <br/>Yeah, I mean, Benry,  right? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I think Benry's the  biggest threat around here. <br/>I say we stick with  that. <br/>Okay. <br/>I personally think we  should vote Benry out first. I've been trying to play this game with people I trust, and right now, I  don't trust Benry. So, I'm trying to protect Brenda, but we may not have the numbers to do it. [birds squawking] He drives me crazy. <br/>He drives me nuts. Yesterday he pissed me off to the highest point of piss-ivity. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Mm. <br/>You want to know  what's going on? <br/>What? <br/>We're trying to vote Brenda  out tonight. And me and you could make a huge power move. And it's gonna be so easy to get people to turn on her. <br/>I know. <br/>Because they see her as  a threat. <br/>If you would have  asked me a few days ago, I'd say that Brenda held a lot of cards in this game. But now, tides have turned a little bit, and this is the first time in the  game that I'm starting to worry a little bit. <br/>You're coming to me  straight, right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>So, what do you think  about the whole thing? <br/>I don't know. I really don't know. 'cause I've tried to... I've sat back and not really... I just think Brenda's  been the ring leader. <br/>She was the ring  leader over at your camp. <br/>Yeah. <br/>She's the ring leader  here. She's just... She's got everybody on her list, and that's how they're going  to go. So, that's how I feel. <br/>Yeah. I've been playing this game with my heart and not my head a lot of the time,  and it absolutely kills me that I might have to vote Brenda out. I don't trust Benry. I don't trust Holly all that much. Dan-- I don't really trust him. Nay-- I don't trust her anymore. So, if Brenda's gone, I'm playing the game with people that I don't really  trust. That's a... That's a scary thought. <br/>A lot of people are  saying you. I don't know if there's any numbers to save you. The thing that changed was nay. <br/>What do you mean? Nay's not gonna vote for me. <br/>Nay swears she's  voting for you. Nay was... Nay's the one that screwed it up. It sure as hell wasn't my idea. <br/>Hmm. It looks like there is operation take-out-Brenda in place. I'm pretty annoyed about it, but I think all I can do is stay cool. The last thing I want to do is start scrambling. It just shows that you're desperate. So, you know, if I show confidence, my friends have confidence in me. It shows that, yeah, I kind of want to stick with Brenda. <br/>Tell her who messed  the five of us first? <br/>Naonka? <br/>Exactly. <br/>But how? <br/>She wants you out. <br/>I trusted her 1,000%. <br/>Me, too. <br/>But then, now what? None of those people are going to be loyal to you. They saw the alliance, and now they're breaking it, though, so, you think  they're going to save you? <br/>What are you thinking? What are you going to do? Maybe you blindside them with your immunity idol. You know what I mean? Because if I get voted out tonight, there's no way you can get the numbers  back. <br/>The idol is  definitely something to be used to not only to protect yourself, but also  someone within your alliance. My goal would be to never have to use it at all. However, at tribal council, the moment came up where I needed to use it to  save Brenda, I'm going to have to consider very strongly doing that. <br/>You don't think Sash  is going to give Brenda the idol? <br/>Hell, no. <br/>I'm just furious that  NaOnka would make such a dumb move. I thought we had a great alliance. I really believed that we would go to the end. But now I don't even want to see NaOnka's face. I wanted to take out Benry, but, hopefully, Sash is going to give me his  immunity idol, and we blindside NaOnka. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring  in the members of our jury. Alina and Marty, voted out at the last tribal council. Sash, were you surprised at the last vote when Marty was sent home? <br/>Yeah, I think a lot  of people were surprised, but since the last tribal council, there's been a  lot of reshuffling in the tribe, and so, I think I'm more out of the loop now  than I've been since the game started. <br/>Jeff: Really? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Jeff: Chase, do you  believe Sash believes he's out of the loop? <br/>I do, because he had  a strong alliance, and now that strong alliance seems to be go gone. <br/>Jeff: Brenda, any  regrets over the last vote? <br/>Yeah. I didn't want to vote Marty. All my peeps know it, but I had to prove something to people who were in my  alliance that they could trust me. <br/>Jeff: How hard is it  for you to trust people out here? <br/>Not hard. I've never had a problem with that from the start. And I thought that there was a really strong core alliance, the strongest one  in this whole game. I know that for a fact. And it looks like what's happening now is there's a break in the alliance  because of NaOnka wanting to jump ship, and this is the most surprising thing  because I was worried about these guys right here. Meanwhile, she's the one that wants to go. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka, that's  a pretty straight-out accusation. <br/>I don't think it was  me, to be honest with you. I think... Jeff: Hold on. You don't think it was you? <br/>It was not me, okay? Everybody could put it on me, but I'll put it like this. Chase was running around yesterday with his head cut off. It's something that Chase does. He didn't know what to do. He was paranoid. <br/>Jeff: So you're  telling Brenda right now, "It wasn't me." It was not me. You know, you've got to follow your intuition in this game, but... Can I get in on this? <br/>It was not me. <br/>I did go to Brenda  because I trusted her. So this is no new news to anybody. <br/>Jeff: Purple Kelly,  weigh in on this. Give us 20 years of wisdom. <br/>Well, let me tell  you, 20 years of wisdom. I think that... Well, I think that this is the first tribal council I felt  completely out of the loop on what's going on, to be completely honest. <br/>Jeff: Have you been  learning stuff tonight? <br/>Yes, completely! Like, my whole... My... The wheels are turning in my head. My game plan, it's... I'm... Like, this... It's enlightening. <br/>Jeff: So, Brenda,  you've heard a lot of people talking. Now where do you sit? What do you think happened? <br/>Why would Sash break  up the best alliance here 'cause he's so smart? And why would Chase let me in on it the day before? He didn't have to tell me. So then, it makes sense that it was NaOnka wanting to jump ship. That makes more sense to me. <br/>Jeff: What happens, Sash,  if you break trust in this game? What do you put at risk? <br/>That you may get sent  home. I think the people here that really know me know that I am trustworthy, and  that's the only reason why I made it to the merge, and hopefully, that's why  I'll stick around for another tribal council. <br/>Jeff: So, Brenda, did  you scramble this afternoon? <br/>I did little things  that I think would help. I knew that if I had a chance, I thought it would be with Chase and with Sash,  and if I talked with both of them, to make them see, like, what the hell?,  maybe they would switch. The rest is, like, "Okay, yeah, they'll vote for me, whatever." but  that was my plan. <br/>Jeff: So, Brenda, you  would argue that you were trying to stay in this game, even now. <br/>Just not scrambling,  yeah. <br/>Jeff: What is it about  the word "Scrambling?" are you too proud for that word? <br/>I think so. It's the truth. I just feel like there are better options, and there's a different way to do  things. <br/>Jeff: So scrambling  is beneath you? <br/>It's just not my  style. <br/>In my opinion, I  think if people see you scrambling, they see you as if you've already lost. "Look at her, she's scrambling. Look at that. Isn't she funny? Don't you feel bad for her?" who can I really change here? It's the people that I've been talking to this whole time. I talk to you one-on-one, I look at you in the eye, and you know that I'm  real. <br/>Jeff: Sash, you got  to be shaking in your boots. This is disastrous for anybody who had an alliance. 'cause right now, this... It's like a little bomb just dropped in here and  ba-boom! <br/>I think since last  tribal council, everyone's alliances have changed a bit. And people have a much different outlook in the game now than they did just a  couple of days ago, and sometimes you have to make changes accordingly. <br/>Jeff: Well, it sounds  like there are a couple of different philosophies about what it takes to keep  yourself in this game. Let's see how it plays out. Jane, you have individual immunity. I know you're keeping it. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: All right, you  cannot vote for Jane. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Dan, you're up. <br/>You should have  scrambled. <br/>You are my real, true  enemy, and I thought you were my friend. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally  the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote-- Brenda. Naonka. Benry. One vote Brenda, one vote Benry, one vote NaOnka. Brenda. That's two votes Brenda. Brenda. That's three votes Brenda, one vote Benry, one vote NaOnka. That's four votes Brenda. Eleventh person voted out and the third member of our jury-- Brenda. That's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Brenda, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Jeff: Time for you to  go. Well, if there's one thing to be learned it's this. If you want to win this game and the million dollars that goes with it,  you've got to fight for it. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for  scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on Survivor...  Naonka's antics have the tribe in an uproar. <br/>I was just shocked  that NaOnka would do something so stupid. <br/>Naonka obviously  wasn't thinking straight. We've got to get her out now. <br/>If one of the guys  had done that, I would have told them to just get the ... Out of here and  don't come back. <br/>I'm still in  disbelief, really, at how outplayed I was by the person that I trusted the  most, NaOnka. It's just funny how the game changed so fast for me. One day I was at the top, and now, I'm out. It was a crazy game that I-I didn't expect would end so soon for me, but, um,  I am kind of sad that it's over.
