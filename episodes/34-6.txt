<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor": At exile island, Debbie was living  in the lap of luxury with cochran.  I'm presenting you with an advantage option.  I'm taking the extra vote.  Jeff: At the Mana tribe, Brad was working his way to the top.  I'm in with Sierra. You just are to stick with us.  Jeff: At the Nuku tribe, Varner and Sandra were at the bottom but Tai became  paranoid.  There's always a chance they might blind side me.  Jeff: At tribal council...  If Tai wants to spit out a name, i'm vote with you, Tai.  What just happened?  I named as you.  Jeff: By throwing Ozzy under the bus. In the end, Sandra was too big of a  threat. Sandra, the tribe has spoken.  Don't do it, Jeff.  Jeff: Debbie joined the Nuku tribe.  That tribal was scarier than exile. [ laughter ]  how was it?  Wooo!  How are you?  Oh, i'm good. I’m may be the only person who has ever got to sit in and be  privy to a tribal council like that without having jury duty. And now Sandra  is gone, and I’m am back with Nuku, where I’m belong. It's good to be home.  It's good to see you.  Oh, God.  I hope exile wasn't too terrible?  It was, but--  hey.  That's why i'm playing this game.  Right.  There was no flipt, you guys?  There was no flint?  No.  So people asked me about exile. Look, what happened on exile stays on exile.  And I’m have no intention of letting myself or mr. Cochran down. Lips are  sealed. &gt;.great to be back.  Me, too. I’m was about to vote Tai out.  You were worried, really? No, you were not.  I was super worried and it's only because it was one of those things--  your name.  Yeah, you're just like oh, my God.  The conversation confused me. I’m said my God. I’m might be at the bottom  right now. And Ozzy is the only name that makes sense. Ozzy is a threat. He  wins individual immunity. I’m say it out loud because I’m think I’m need to  go there. I'm terrible at tribal and that worried me a little bit.  When you guys started talking about Ozzy, I’m covered my hands over and was  peek out like it was a horror movie. I’m was like, "don't you guys turn  on him." I’m was peeking out my fingers. I’m thought oh, my God, this is  worse than exile. Least I’m had peace there.  So in case my name is out there, I’m have two idols, but i'm nervous. Somehow  this thing happens...  You guys really burned a lot of wood.  We did I’m got blindsides big time. Those bitches every one of them. I’m want  to punch them all in the throat boarng every one of them. I'm mad but I’m can't  show it. I’m can't let them know that i'm mad because I’m need them.  I'm so sorry about not including you in the vote tonight. It shouldn't have  happened.  That's fine.  But--  it's a name game, you know, and i've not included people in my plans, too, so  it's my turn to get blindsided and it's okay. I'm still here. I’m would have  voted for her without telling her anything. We didn't have to do all that. I’m  went to work immediately. Why not? I’m mean, why wait? And I’m had a great  conversation Zeke, and Zeke just poured everything out to me.  Here's the deal-- so i'm going to be, like, perfectly honest with you, right?  You can take this information and do what you want with it.  Yeah, yeah.  But I’m want you to know that I’m am very sincere in working with you to the  end of this game. I’m don't want to get you a seat on the jury. I’m want to  get you a seat in the final three. You know.  Yeah.  I've been there.  I understand. I'm all right with it. I’m appreciate it. I’m really like you  and I’m hope we can be friends.  Me, too.  It's all good. Just, you know, you don't have to lie to me.  No more lies from hereon out.  I promise.  Whatever you want to know.  Zeke and I’m have bonded, and I’m think he genuinely feels bad about what he  did to me tonight. So i'm not done just yet. Captioning funded by cbs âª âª  Jeff: Come on in, guys! Mana getting your first look at the new Nuku tribe.  Oh! Sandra.  Jeff: Sandra, the only two-time winner finally voted out of "Survivor"  after 94 days of playing the game.  Wow!  Jeff: And Debbie joins the new Nuku tribe. Shall we get to today's reward  challenge?  Yes!  Jeff: For today's challenge, you're going to work together to unspool ropes  releasing a key. You'll then build a ladder, climb to the top, use the key to  unlock a bag of balls. You'll then squeeze through a net sling to the finish,  will attempt to land the balls in a series of targets. First tribe to get one  ball in each of the five targets wins reward. Want to know what you're  playing for?  Yes.  Yes!  Aah!  Pizza!  Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  Pizza!  Jeff: "Survivor" pizza.  Oh, my God! Can we have a bite just to taste it?  Can we get a sample?  Jeff: No samples. You want it you gotta earn it. 10 pizzas. Pepperoni,  cheese, meat lovers, vegetarian.  Oh, my God!  Hawaiian.  Hawaiian!  Jeff: And ice cold soft drinks to go along with it.  Oh, my God!  Jeff: I’m know it's worth playing for. Give you a minute to strategize and  we'll get started.  Wow!  Jeff: All right, here we go, for reward in the form of pizza and soft drinks,  Survivors ready? Go!  Be still, be still!  Jeff: It is Sierra leading Hali and kayla for Nuku. First part of this is  working together to unspool that rope to drop the key. Ozzy, Andrea, and Sierra  in the lead right now, and Sierra, Hali, and Michaela having a lot of  trouble.  That's it!  Jeff: Great communication by Ozzy, Sarah, and Andrea right now.  You got it! That's it! That's it.  Jeff: They've got it. Unhook! You're good! Get that key and get to the mat!  Now we all go.  Jeff: Nuku with a nice lead now. One person--  Tai, go!  Jeff: Unties the ladder rungs. It's going to be Tai.  Hali, Michaela, under your hook.  Jeff: Mana has their key released.  Let's go!  <br/>Jeff: Let's gMana! Tai is ripping through those knots. It's going to be Aubry  on the knots for Mana. Go! It is now Varner and Zeke working together to  build the ladder. Aubry has made up a lot of time. Aubry's got it, go! It's  now cull pepp cullpepper and Troyzan working together. There's a huge reward  on the line-- pizza and soft drinks. Debbie heads up now to release that bag  of balls. Cullpepper and Troyzan working together.  Faster, Debbie, faster, go, go.  Jeff: Debbie has the balls. Head over Nuku. Mana has got to pick it up!  Go, go, go!  Jeff: Gu, Nuku. Nuku continues to lead in this challenge. Cirie goes to the  top. Nuku making their way through the net swing. Mana losing a lot of time.  Go, Ozzy, go!  Jeff: Alwaysy is through. You can untie the balls.  I got it, I’m got it.  Jeff: Cirie has the balls. Everybody up and over. Mana trying to make up more  time again. Nuku has been in the lead from the get-go.  Here they come, Ozzy, hurry.  Jeff: Ozzy has the balls. He's going to start launching.  You got it, Ozzy.  Jeff: Here's comes Mana. It is not easy to get through that net Ozzy launches  again. Ozzy connects, scores one for Nuku! Go, Sierra!  This is yours, Sierra! This is yours to win.  Jeff: Ozzy launches again for Nuku, and he connects. Ozzy has the second  target. Sierra has the balls free.  There it is, baby.  Jeff: And he connects for Nuku. Nuku with three! Mana with zero! Cullpepper  going to take over for Mana. Ozzy launch again.  Oh, my God, there it is!  Jeff: Just misses. Cullpepper quickly scores with his first hit. Mana has one  now, it is 3-1. Ozzy looking for number four. And he's got it. One left for Nuku.  Cullpepper trying to pick up the pace now. Nuku has four, Ozzy for the win.  And nand out. Opens the door for cullpepper but he can't get it to drop. Ozzy  could win it right here and he does! Nuku wins peets dis pizza and soft  drinks back at camp!  Oh, my God! Oh, my God, pizza!  Jeff: Nuku, nice job, big win, pizza, soft drinks. Come get it. Have a good  afternoon.  Oh, my God.  Nice guy.  Smell natha!  Jeff: All right, Mana, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to  camp.  The pizza would have made a world of difference. I’m mean, i'm from jersey,  i'm as tough as they come, but cerTain things you break down. It's been 17  days. It's rough. It's taxing on you physically, emotionally. So we don't  know what to do. Âª âª  10 pizzas.  It's going to make them slugush.  That's more than a pizza apiece. When we lost 10 whole pizzas, I’m tried to  hold my head high, but I’m am exhausted. I’m haven't ate for three days. I’m can't  sleep at night. I’m feel like i've lost a crap-ton of weight. I’m mean, it is  100% real right now. This game is hard. I’m cried before I’m came. I’m was  like--  me, too. Why are you doing this to yourself? Yeah.  It's so much more than the hunger.  But you love it?  I know. When you get to a cerTain point on "Survivor," your mind  goes to places you don't think it's going to go, and when you get home, it's  really, really hard to explain what you've been through. After I’m played,  when I’m went home, people said, "why are you different?" and I’m couldn't  say why.  Are you crying now? Stop!  I don't ever cry.  I'm kind of crying, too. It's so hard. If you've never done tyou don't  realize what you go through. It's amazing.  It is. It's a long-- a long journey.  You know, I’m played the game. I’m played for 12 days. I’m didn't how hard it  was on monica to get this far.  Yeah.  She got home and she was--- she was different. I’m mean, she hurt. I’m never  understood why she was hurting. I’m mean, it's only been 17 days, but I’m get  it. That's enough for me. God. I’m gotta go wash my clothes. I'll be all  right. I'm good. I'm good. When monica and I’m played "blood and  water" she got all the way to day 39, and I’m don't know I’m truly  appreciated until i, you know, have been here for 17 days. For her to do what  she dshe's a tough cookie. It's kind of been a guide for me. I’m guess she's  been my strength and my compass right on my arm.  I can just say thank you for opening up like that because nobody ever gets at  home everyone is like, "you changed. What's your problem? And i'm like,  "you really don't get it."  no.  So that meant a lot to me.  Okay.  I am consistently amazed at Brad culpepper and his ability to open up. Like, Brad  is to me the most genuine person that i've met out here. And it's the first  time I’m feel like I’m think I’m have a person working with me.  Pure emotion. I’m could feel if. It was, like, palpable. So real.  I appreciate that. I'm impressed with you, girl.  Likewise.  Cirie and Aubry came up and said it's so special you said that because they  saw the real me, and surprisingly, made us feel closer and really galvanized  my relationship between those two. Troyzan, Sierra, and myself have already  got a good connection. So I’m think it sliddifies the five people I’m have on  this side as far as who I’m want to go with. Âª âª  oh, my God. Let's eat! Let's eat! Let's eat!  We dominated the reward challenge. It was epic.  Cheers!  Cheers!  At this stage of the game, it's very important for the tribe moral to win  something like that because the game is just starting to wear on people, and  the extra boost is the most important thing right now.  Oh, my good God!  I'm going to destroy this pizza.  I'll eat this whole thing.  It felt so good to finally jump up and down and say, "we won." but  i'm on the bottom when you look at it. So to win something like that doesn't  mean a damn thing.  Oh, my God, Ozzy, may I’m just say, you're a beast, babe.  It was all you guys just directing me how to do it because I’m cooperate have  done it.  I am thinking to myself, if I’m want to save my own butt out here.  Have to find the way to throw the shade on smebles. Ozzy is well rounded,  he'll win this game. Ozzy is very strong. You let him loose in individual  immunity challenges, he'll win every single one of them so now is the time to  get rid of Ozzy. Now is the time. Guys need me as much as I’m need you when  it comes to a merge.  Absolutely.  And I’m think it will be good.  Yeah. Okay, so, say we merge. Do you feel like you've got people over there  that we can bring in?  Yes.  Okay. Today, after the reward, Varner starts saying, "i really want to  work with you guys." and I’m think we can pull Varner and actually use  him as a number. And I’m really, truly feel we have made that connection. So  do you have your eyes on anyone that you want to get rid of first, ear do you  not care and we can let everyone else decide?  I want to get rid of Ozzy.  You do.  I do?  Just so we all have a fighting chance. I'm sick of watching "Survivor"  where all the a.people get to the end and people like us just sort of sit  there and hope he loses. I’m don't want that. I'd like to win that necklace  every now and then.  I know, I’m want tow win one. Then he says could Ozzy potentially be the  vote? That's what i'm thinking of right now. I’m need to be careful because  that's a huge move but i'm ready to prove why I’m am a game changer.  This is elimination number seven, and that's when you start taking off the  big, physical threats. I'm good. I'm great.  We're close to a merge, and we need to take out who is the biggest threat. It  might be time to cut Ozzy's throat. Âª âª  Jeff: All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?  Yes!  Jeff: First things.  If Aubry, we've got to take it back. Once again, immunity is back up for  grabs. For today's challenge, four members of each tribe swim out to a raft.  You'll then pull yourself to a series of stations. At each station, you'll  dive down, release a set of bowies, place them in a bag. Once you have  collected all the buoys, the three remains tribe members will use them to  solve a 13-letter word puzzle. First tribe to finish wins immiewnts, safe  from the vote. Losers, tribal council, where somebody will be the seventh  person voted out of the "Survivor: Game changers." give you a  minute to strategize, we'll get started. Give you a minute to strategize,  we'll get started. All right, here we go. In the water for Nuku it is Tai, Zeke,  Sarah, Ozzy. In the water for Mana Aubry, Hali, culpepper, Troyzan. For  immunity, Survivors ready? Go! You're only as fast as your slowest swimmer.  Everybody's got to get to that first plattform, then you can start pulling  your raft. Go, Nuku!  Pull!  Jeff: Go, Mana! Both tribes pulling quickly.  Pull!  Jeff: Nuku off to a bit of a lead. Mana slower out of the gate. Once you're  across from the buoy, you can get in the water. Ozzy is in the water.  Culpepper in the water for Mana. It takes Ozzy no time at all. Ozzy releases  that first bag of buoys. Gotta get them all back to the raft! Culpepper pops  up without the first bag, gotta go back down. This is going to open the lead  for Nuku. Culpepper has his released. Nuku looking for that second set of  buoys. Culpepper still trying to get the buoys back to his raft. Ozzy does it  in one breath, releases the next accept the of buoys, and quickly gathers  them. Nuku continues their lead in this challenge. Go, Mana! Culpepper  finally has all the buoys from that first bag. Nuku has their second set of  buoys. They're looking for that third and final set of buoys. Aubry going to  give it a go this time for Mana. Ozzy back in the water for Nuku. And once  again, Ozzy is down and back up, extending the lead for Nuku. Aubry supfor Mana.   Go, go, go, go!  Jeff: Nuku has all their bupeeps they're heading to the finish. Nuku now with  a huge lead. Gotta get it in the bag. Aubry's got to get on! Go, Mana. Nuku  with the bowies. Varner, Debbie, and Andrea working on figuring out that  13-letter puzzle.  You got it, Brad!  Jeff: Culpepper dives back in for Mana. Culpepper back up for Mana with that  last set of buoys, but Nuku is already starting on this word puzzle. Go, Mana!  Mana has their third set of bupeeps they've got a lot of time to make up. Mana  is back. Get those buoys. Now system Cirie, Sierra, and Michaela going to  start working on that word puzzle. It is Andrea, Debbie, and Varner solving  for Nuku. And they've had time to start looking at these letters. Big time  advantage for Nuku.  That's what i'm thinking.  Try "shipmaster."  Jeff: Mana is going to rearrange letters and see if they can figure that out.  Everyone running words in their heads, trying different letter combinations.  What could it be. Andrea and Varner have a new idea. Will this be it?  My God, this is tough.  I know.  Let's try something with the-- with these guys.  Jeff: Andrea now has a different idea. She's moving some letters around.  Let's try it. Let's try it.  Jeff: Mana thinks they have something. A little bit of excitement over at Mana.  They're starting to quickly move letters around. Nuku had a huge lead and  blew it.  I got it, Tai! I’m got it.  Jeff: Could Mana be right?  Culpepper thinks so.  Jeff: What is it?  Metamorphosis.  Jeff: Mana wins immunity with met morph fist. The one word that captures what  "Survivor" is about.  Oh, my goodness!  Jeff: Mana, congratulations. Once again, immunity is yours. [ applause ]  nobody going home from your tribe. Grab your stuff. Head on out. All right, Nuku,  tribal council tonight where somebody will be the seventh person voted out of  this game. See you tonight at tribal.  I know i'm probably in trouble. I'm on my own. I’m have to make everybody  vote for Ozzy. And i'll be doing everything I’m can to guarantee i'm not the  one going home.  Aah! I’m wasn't even close. Was anyone close?  No.  That one is on all of us. We all were standing there staring at those  letters. Nobody did anything wrong.  No.  So it's scramble afternoon, hunahpu? Yeah.  I guess my name is on the block. Can I’m have one-on-one time with everybody?  I'll make my pitch and be at peace. You don't have to lie to me. I’m don't  have an idol.  Anybody need water?  I'll go with you.  Good.  Perfect. Five of us are here.  Okay, my gut-- and it's just my gut. I’m want everybody to talk. If we had to  take a vote now, can we just do it quick. Varner. What does your gut say Sarah?   My gut says get rid of Ozzy.  Tonight?  I trust Varner more than Ozzy at this point. He may not stick with us forever  but for a couple votes. I’m don't think Ozzy will stick with us for a couple  of votes so that's just my perspective but i'll vote wherever you guys vote.  I would like nothing more than keep Varner in the game. I’m like him as a person,  I’m do. But to be honest, I’m think our best best is to stick-- I’m really  think Ozzy wants to vote with us for one or two votes.  I don't know. You guys, i'm really convicted.  I want to safe Jeff Varner, it's very important, but I’m don't want to lose  rawz ozy because the way i've set it up is to have bigger threats out there  than myself. So we're in a precarious position.  What's the probability in your mind that i'm going home tonight?  Honestly, it's about 50%.  Okay.  And i'm just letting you know because I’m like you.  No, I’m appreciate it. I’m told you all to let me go.  Yeah.  So you don't want to get rid of Ozzy.  Look, Varner, i'm going to do what I’m can to save you. I'm going to be  perfectly honest, I’m don't know if I’m can.  Zeke has been my partner and I’m thought I’m could pitch, "let's get rid  of Ozzy," but when I’m threw that out there Zeke shut me down which was  very telling to me because Zeke does not want to get rid of Ozzy. What I’m do  need to do to stay here?  I don't know, but Andrea and Ciera are going to make you feel safe.  A lite bulb went off. As youy and Zeke may be working together. I’m feel like  Zeke is working with Ozzy more than he's working with you and Andrea.  Really?  Zeke sat me down and he said, "you're probably going home."  yeah.  And the girls are going to lie to you.  What?  Because they just don't want you to know. Zeke is working both sides, and I’m  let Sarah know that, and it pissed her off.  Zeke is work Ozzy. He's not on your team. If i'm going thoam tonight, i'm  going to cut them all off at the knees. Zeke is not being truthful. There's  something about Zeke nobody knows. I’m feel like I’m know something about Zeke  that nobody else has picked up on, is insignificant to this game. It means  nothing, but this is not the guy you think he is. There's something else  here. If I’m have to go to tribal tonight and raise mortal hell, i'm going to  do it. I'm not going quietly off this island.  Why would Zeke do that?  Because he's a coward.  That pisses me off, Andrea.  It made me mad, too, I’m was pissed.  I'm irate right now. Zeke threw us under the bus. I’m realize that, but right  now, Zeke is with us, so we'll get through this vote but it's not cool.  Is he? Zeke sat him down and said the girls are going to lie to you just to  make you feel good. And i'm like what? Why would you throw us under the bus  so you could save face. Things are starting to look weird now. Zeke didn't  doesn't want to get rid of Ozzy and Zeke threw Andrea and I’m under the bus  and i'm like this is kind of starting to stink. Do Zeke and Ozzy have  something more going on that I’m don't know about? And that really scares me.  This could be a huge mistake, but maybe we need to get rid of Ozzy, and keep  ventura. Âª âª  Jeff: All right, so at the last tribal council, Sandra's voted out. Varner,  you seemed to think that it meant you would be next.  Yeah, I’m mean, that's logical. Wouldn't you say? I'm on the bottom. I'm  next. I’m tried my best to not be next, but it doesn't look like that worked.   Jeff: You know because you know you're on the bottom or--  i know. I've had conversations with everybody in this group today. I’m know  i'm going home tonight.  Jeff: Debbie, that got a reaction from you.  Yeah, when somebody is that cerTain, a little feeling of unease just creeps  over me like i'm just trying to prepare myself to be absolutely shocked  tonight.  <br/>Jeff: Jeff, tell me what happened at camp? Did everybody just say, "Varner,  you're going home?"  i went and talked to each person individually after the challenge today. I've  been talking to people for the last two and a half days. I’m feel like I’m know--  knew-- where people stood. I’m felt like I’m was getting in the cracks. I’m felt  like I’m was moving off the bottom. But it was revealed to me today how  little I’m knew about what actually is going on here at old camp Nuku. They  are not six strong. Because i've been arguing all day long who do you want to  vote out? Half the group says, "if you get enough numbers to vote Ozzy,  i'll vote Ozzy, because Ozzy is a strategic threat. He is the total  package." so it began to reveal itself to me that there was a secret  alliance between Zeke and Ozzy. Okay? There is deception going on right here,  and you guys are the victims of it. Bottom of the alliance. Boom, boom, and  boom. Bottom. So I’m am proposing tonight vote for Ozzy. We'll take care of  the whole situation if you will vote and you will vote and you will vote.  I'll hook us up. That's the pitch i'm making to you today.  That's good.  There is deception here.  Yeah.  Deceptions on levels, Jeff, that these guys don't even understand. There's  more.  Jeff: Continue.  Why haven't you told anyone you're transgender? What i'm showing is a  deception.  But that's personal.  That has nothing to do with the game.  That's not a deception.  You didn't have to do that.  That is so wrong. For to you bring that up.  I'm not using that as anything negative.  That has nothing to do with the game. That's personal.  I'm not knocking him.  That's not deception--  that was something to reveal who whom he wanted.  I argue for the rights of transgender people every day in the state of north  carolina. I’m would never say or do anything to hurt anyone here. Jeff, i'm  arguing for my life. I’m feel like i've got to throw everything at the wall.  Outing somebody--  i'm not outing him.  Yes, you are! You outed him! Nobody has the right to out anybody.  I agree with Tai. It was for Zeke to discuss when he was comfortable  discussing it.  In two reasons I’m played "Survivor," I’m told nobody.  I don't want the perception to be that i'm this evil, hateful person.  What was your goal in doing that?  To show this deception.  That isn't deceiving us strategically in a game. I’m don't thii don't think  so.  It reveals the ability to deceive.  Jeff: Jeff, when you say by rejeelg that Zeke is transgender, you're proving  that he's deceptive--  i'm not saying, Jeff, that transgender people are deceptive.  Jeff: No, you're saying by him not revealing it that he's capable of  deception. That is a giant leap of logic. Do you honestly not see that?  I do see that. And I’m feel horrible about it. I'm just trying everything  that I’m can. And I’m am so sorry, Zeke. I'm not-- I’m support you.  Jeff: Jerveg you can't unring the bell.  I'm not unringing the bell. I'm just apologizing, Jeff.  Jeff, you should be ashamed of yourself.  I am a little bit.  I should be ashamed of yourself for what you're willing to do to get yourself  further in a game for $1 million. You're playing with people's lives at this  point.  And I’m am so sorry, Zeke.  Jeff: Jeff, when you look at Zeke's expression, who typically is very  connected, and now just visually to me looks a little bit like he's on an  island of his own, do you--  Zeke, i'm sorry.  Jeff: You're sorry?  I'm sorry. That's not the intention I’m had.  There's a great kick tore this. I’m really liked Varner. I’m thought we,  like, connected over the past couple of days. We shared a lot of stories. He  shared a lot about his life. And it's been tearing me up that I’m had to vote  this guy out. And i'm the one who gave him the heads up today because I’m didn't  want to blindside him.  Jeff: Jeff what, do you think the l.g.b.t.ee community reaction will be to  this?  The community around me knows who I’m am. They know what I’m support. My  transgender friends know who I’m am and what I’m support. And they know i'm  not this horrible monster.  Jeff: But in a way, you're saying there is no line, if i'm desperate enough,  I’m will do or say anything.  It's a game for a million dollars, and I’m clearly have made the wrong choice  tonight. And my conscience is in pain. I’m feel horrible. I’m didn't think  that wouldn't reaction. I’m thought he was proud and out and loud about it.  And I’m didn't dnot understand what exactly--  if you thought he was out and proud and loud about it, why did you make it a  point that everybody would have to know that?  Because we haven't discussed it. And he--  because he's not out and proud and loud about it.  I get that now. You guys, i'm going to beat myself up enough already.  Jeff: Jeff, you can't have it both ways. You can't say on one hand the reason  i'm telling people is to prove that he's capable of deception, and then  immediately say, "he was out and proud of it." both can't exist.  And i'm so sorry, Zeke. I'm so sorry.  Jeff: Tai,s as a player in this game, and as a gay man yourself, you are  clearly very upset and let Jeff know it. How are you feeling now?  I think I’m can understand Varner. He was just deps exprat trying to save  himself. I’m think he crossed a line and didn't realize he did. I’m think he  sincerely feels bad about it. And he just has to live with it. But still, I’m  have this really strong stand, whenever you want to come out as a gay person,  as transgender, it's your choice. Nobody should out anybody.  Jeff: Andrea, you had a very big and instant reaction. You're still emotional  about it.  I don't know. I've been playing with Zeke for 18 days. And I’m didn't know.  And just to see someone out someone else is pretty painful. But I’m understand  that Jeff is feeling very on the outs and he's very desperate, so I’m do  believe he regrets it. It's just-- that was really tough. I’m feel-- I’m really  feel for Zeke. You know, it's his right to tell people.  Jeff: Varner, is it starting to hit you the gravity that you didn't just tell  six people. You told millions of people. Is that what's happening? You're  realizing now this was--  Jeff, I’m assumed that everyone in his world knew. So that's my ignorance.  And I’m thought he was just deceiving these people. It never dawned on me  that no one knew. And so, i'm just devastated.  Jeff: Zeke, you've been amazingly strong through this. Was this something that  was a part of your life? Were you out to your friends? Or was it even  anything that was in your normal daily life?  Well, cerTainly. You know, being trans, transitioning, it's a long process.  It's a very difficult process. And, you know, there are people who know. But  then I’m sort of got to a point where I’m stopped telling people because when  people know that about you, that's sort of who you are. There are questions  people ask. People want to know about your life, and they want to know the  this and that. Sort of overwhelms everything else they know about you.  Jeff: You're no longer Zeke.  Right, you're the trans person. And I’m think i've been fortunate to play  "Survivor" as long as i've been playing it and not have that label.  And one of the reasons why I’m didn't want to lead with that and I’m didn't  want to be the "trans" Survivor player and I’m wanted to be Zeke  the Survivor player.  You are.  And I’m feel like I’m am. I’m knew someone might pick up on it or it might be  revealed. So I’m am prepared to talk about it, to have it be part of my  "Survivor" experience. It's kind of crappy the way it's happened.  I'm sorry, Zeke. I'm sorry.  But, you know, metamorphosis is the word of the show. I’m think i've seen  such a met morph fist of myself, today is 52 of the day of played "Survivor."  and I’m don't know the scared kid who hit the map at 33 would be as calm as I’m  am right now. But i've started two fires with just bamboo. I've won  challenges. I've been part of blindsides. I've done all kinds of crazy stuff  and I’m am a changed, stronger, better man today than I’m was then. So, you  know, what? Varner, it's really not cool. But you know, i'm fine.  You don't have a bigger cheerleader in anyone but me.  I don't even need a cheerleader.  I know.  Because I’m know I’m can do whatever I’m want to.  I know. I'm so sorry. Now that I’m can sit here and see what happened, i'm  shocked. I’m can't believe that I’m did that. And I’m feel horrible.  Jeff: Sarah, you're still shake your head at Varner.  I'm-- that's not me. And... Like-- i'm sorry that i'm crying this but --  when you say, "that's not me," what do you mean?  That was a malicious attack, what he did. It was I’m don't care what you  said.  There was not malice in that.  It was. That's your opinion. Mine is that it was.  I know but malice say pretty hefty claim. And there's no malice there.  Okay. I’m don't treat people that way. And--  i don't treat people that way.  I can talk?  Yes, i'm just-- I’m don't want you to paint me as something i'm not.  Judge don't you go ahead.  Jeff: That is an ironic statement.  I know. I’m know.  Um... You know, i'm just thankful that I’m got to know Zeke for who Zeke is.  I've been with him for last 18 days. And he's, like, super kick-ass. And, you  know, i'm from the midwest. I’m come from a very conservative background. So  it's not very diverse when it comes to a lot of gay and lesbian and  transgender and things like that. So i'm not exposed to it as much as most of  these people are. And the fact that I’m can love this guy so much and it  doesn't change anything for me makes me realize that i've grown huge as a  person. , of course, we want to come away with with the million dollars, but  the metamorphosis that i've even made as a person they didn't realize until  this minute is invaluable. And i'm sorry it came out that way, but i'm glad  it did. And, like, i'm so glad that I’m got to know you for Zeke and not, you  know, what you were afraid of us knowing you as. And i'll never look at you  that way.  Thank you.  You know, Jeff, i'm cerTainly not anyone who should be a role model for  anybody else, but maybe there's someone who is a "Survivor" fan and  me being out on the show helps him or helps her or helps someone else. And so  maybe this will lead to a greater good.  Jeff: Well, I’m think I’m know the answer to this question, but there's no  question who's going home tonight, right?  No, sure.  Jeff: Zeke?  No.  Jeff: Debbie?  No.  Tai, Ozzy, Andrea?  No.  It's Varner.  It is.  I'm ready to go.  Jeff: We don't need to vote. Just grab your torch. Just grab your torch.  Jeff: Varner, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go.  Jeff: Well, tonight was a complicated but ultimately beautiful night that  will never be forgotten. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

Jeff: Next time on "Survivor." when 13 game changers come together.  ... We are officially merge.  Oh, my God.  Game is on.  Jeff: It's a scramble for power.  It's just like people are everywhere.  I'm ready to go in guns blation.  I don't even know what I’m was thinking. It was a horrible move. It was me  wrapped up in this game trying to do everything I’m possibly could. But  nobody on this planet should do what I’m did tonight, ever. And i'm so sorry  to anyone I’m offended, especially Zeke and his family and his friends. I’m can't  even talk. I'm sorry.
