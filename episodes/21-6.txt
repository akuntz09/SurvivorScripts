<br/> Jeff: Previously on Survivor. In the battle of old versus young, the younger tribe was thriving. <br/>Hands down, we're the  bomb. <br/>Jeff: And their  hierarchy was clearly established: Brenda, Chase, NaOnka and Sash were on top. <br/>It's a great feeling  to know that you're on the side of the numbers and to have control this early  in the game. <br/>Jeff: Alina and Kelly  B. Were at the bottom. <br/>I don't like you. Never have liked you. I really don't need no charity case on the jury. <br/>Jeff: Drop your buffs. We are switching tribes. But a surprise switch put old and young on both tribes. It is La Flor wearing yellow versus Espada wearing blue. At the new La Flor, the young people were in control. <br/>We're five and three. It looks good. <br/>Jeff: And they took Jane  under their wing. <br/>I like these kids! <br/>Jeff: Despite showing  everyone his hidden immunity idol, Marty ended up at the top of Sash and Brenda's  hit list. <br/>He's coming into our  home and already setting up like he's the king. [ã    \indistinct shoutã    ] Jeff: Fabio wins it  for La Flor! When the new Espada tribe lost the immunity challenge, Holly joined up with  the young people. <br/>I have a better  chance at going farther with the kids. <br/>Jeff: Even though Dan  with his bad knee was a physical liability to the tribe, the young decided  that Tyrone was a bigger threat. <br/>Tyrone right now, Tyrone... Jeff: At tribal  council, everyone voted against Tyrone, except for Yve, who wasn't told about  the youngsters' plans. <br/>Tyrone, the tribe has  spoken. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Jeff: 15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Ten days ago I was  ready to get out of here and if one lesson I've learned out here is quitting  is an easy way out. If you can't handle the rain, the wind, you should have thought of that  before you came. You signed up for something; suck it up and finish. <br/>So what happened? Why do I feel like I was left out in the dark with you and Danny so much? Because I would have been fine with that. I mean... Tyrone? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I don't know if Danny  and I felt that, because you had an alliance with him. <br/>No. No, I didn't. It surprises me that Holly believes that Tyrone and I were an alliance, and  that's why they couldn't tell me, because... We weren't. It's going to be tough for me, but I'm not walking out of here without a  fight. I was kind of thinking you and I had each other's backs a bit but now I'm  kind of feeling like a fish out of water. <br/>Maybe we need to be a  little bit more open and honest with each other. <br/>Mm-hmm. Well... Because... But Danny  told me this morning that he's done. He said, "I think I'm done." and I said "Why?" and he  said "I can't take this weather and this hut and..." I don't want to throw  anybody under the bus, but Danny doesn't want to be here anymore. So I'll take that information and I'll work around that. That's the game of Survivor. You got to do what you got to do to stay alive. <br/>I think they are  starting to appreciate us. You get up, the dishes are clean. It's like at home; mom cleans the dishes. <br/>I feel like we went  from being, like, in a serious drama, you know, before arriving here, and I  feel like I just fell into, like, bill and ted's excellent adventure,you know? <br/>The young tribe is,  like, 180 degrees from where we came from. We would get up, get wood, fish, and these guys sleep all day. I don't know, but we've been dealt a very bad hand by coming on to a team in  minority numbers. I feel like the young ones bonded and bonded really strong. So I definitely feel like they'd get rid of us in a heartbeat if they could. <br/>Morning, Fabio. <br/>Morning. <br/>How are you, man? <br/>Doing well. <br/>Even though we're all  called La Flor, it's still younger tribe and older tribe. Well, actually, it's younger tribe plus Jane. [ã    \laughsã    ] I mean, look at Jane. Jane blends in right away because she's just a natural, genuine helper. So if we go to tribal council, I think what I want to do is have three people  vote for Marty, three people vote for Jill. That way you flush out the idol and... Whatever happens, one of them is going  home. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys! La flor getting your first look at the new Espada tribe. Tyrone voted out at the last tribal council. <br/>Jeff: Guys ready to  get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First thing's  first. Fabio, I will take it back. [ã    \Fabio sighs heavilyã    ] tribal immunity is not what you're  playing for today. Individual immunity is what you seek. Because tonight both tribes are going to tribal council. Both tribes will vote somebody out of this game. There are two individual immunity necklaces, because one person from each  tribe will win immunity, will be safe at tonight's vote. Here's how it works. On my go, you'll race out into an individual digging area. You'll use a paddle to dig up a rope ring. Toss it over your shoulder into a basket on your backside, then race it back  to the start. The first person to get all three rings wins immunity, is safe from the vote,  and moves on to the final round where you will compete for tribal reward. In the final round, the winner from each tribe will square off in a ring toss. First person to land all three of their rings on the target wins a feast for  their tribe. Here's how it works: The winning tribe will go to tribal council first and  vote somebody out. You will then listen in on the other tribe's tribal council while you feast  on chicken and beef kebobs. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes! <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: All right,  we'll draw for spots, we'll get started. All right, Espada lost the rock-paper-scissor. They're going first. One person will win immunity from this tribe. Here we go. Survivors ready? Go. There are three rope rings buried in the sand. Once you find one, toss it over your shoulder, land it in the basket and take  it to the start. Dan drops his ring. Alina gives it a shot. Just misses. Holly has her first ring. Off to a quick start. Alina lands her first one. Yve lands her first one. Benry lands his first one. Holly with her second ring... And lands it. Holly now in the lead with two! One ring left. Dan still struggling. Alina drops her second one. Benry with a nice toss! Benry on the board with his second one. Chase has his first! Dan still nowhere. It is Holly, Alina and Benry each looking for their final ring. Alina has hers. Can she land it? No. Holly scores her final ring! Holly moving on to the final! [ã    \applauseã    ] nicely done, Holly. <br/>Good job, Holly. <br/>Jeff: Holly, safe  from the vote tonight. You'll compete with the winner from La Flor for a tribal feast. Espada, hit your mats. La flor, you're up. All right, La Flor now seeking individual immunity. Survivors ready? Go! One member of La Flor will take on Holly in the final. Sash has his first one. Brenda lands her first one. Brenda and Sash both with one ring. Fabio has his first ring. Marty lands his first one! Jill has her first one. Kelly b. Has her first. Everybody on the board except Jane and Purple Kelly. Jane has her first, heading back. Marty has his second. Kelly b. Has her second. Jill has her second. We got a race! It is Jill, Marty and Kelly B. Looking for their last rings. Jill has her last ring. Can she land it? No. Kelly b. Now has her third. Just misses. Jill with another shot. Jill lands her final ring! Jill wins immunity! Will take on Holly in the final for a feast. Congratulations. <br/>Thank you. Thank you very much. <br/>Jeff: Jill is safe  from the vote. Jill, you will take on Holly for a tribal feast. Let's move. Here we go. First to land all three rings on a hook wins feast for their tribe. Survivors ready? Go. Two people from the original older tribe squaring off in this challenge. <br/>Slow it down! <br/>Jeff: Jill and Holly. <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: Holly lands her  first ring. <br/>Jill, you've got it. Take your time. <br/>Get in the zone! <br/>Nice! <br/>Jeff: Jill lands her  first ring, and the second ring. Jill and Holly both with two! One ring left. Jill or Holly can win it right here. <br/>Go, Jill! <br/>Jeff: Holly just  misses. Jill wins feast for La Flor! <br/>We're gonna eat! <br/>Jeff: All right,  here's what's going to happen. Tonight, La Flor, you will go to tribal council and vote somebody out, then  listen in on Espada's tribal council, and while doing so, you will feast on  chicken and beef kebobs. La flor, Espada, see you tonight at tribal council. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. <br/>Hey! Winner, winner, winner! It's just such a good feeling to know that we're gonna eat tonight. <br/>...For picking me to  be on this team. <br/>Awesome. <br/>One, two, three... La flor! <br/>The little "One,  two, three, La Flor!" that was totally fake. I mean, Jill and Marty, come on. You could see that they're working their minds, they're working their own  little thing. You just feel it. But worst-case scenario happened. Jill won individual immunity, Marty has the hidden immunity idol, so now  we're stuck. But we will somehow vote someone out that we don't want. <br/>So what I was  thinking-- tell me if you were thinking the same thing-- we split the votes,  three votes... For Marty and three votes for Kelly B. We tell Kelly B., though, that our three votes are going for... Jane. Yep. <br/>Jane. <br/>It's just that easy. <br/>That easy. <br/>Okay. Cool. <br/>Cool. <br/>Since Jill won the  individual immunity today, our whole strategy kind of changes at this point. So the plan for tonight is we'll split the vote between Marty and Kelly B.,  and hopefully flush the idol. <br/>Coconut! <br/>Coconut! Yay! <br/>I'm excited about the  plan that we have in store, because Kelly B. Has never been a part of our alliance. You know, she was gunning for me from the start, plus she has a fake leg. So I think people would give Kelly B. A million dollars because they feel bad for her. And, you know, you can't afford to have someone like that around. <br/>So we need to split  three and three? <br/>I mean, I like Jane,  but I feel like our hand was forced. I really wanted to see Jane around here for as long as we could keep her, but  I've been on the outs with the La Flor group so the best thing I can do is  just kind of lay low and vote with everyone else. <br/>Yeah. Tonight's tribal council is not gonna be easy, because I have to, like, make  sure all these pieces are set. And you never know what Fabio's going to do. I mean, he's clueless, so it's going to be a little complicated. <br/>Dude, I have not told  anybody this, not even on my own tribe, but I am... A grand master in chess. And have you ever heard of guillermo vila before? <br/>No, man, all I've  heard of is bobby fischer. <br/>Okay, well, guillermo  vilas is an argentine grand master. When I was a kid, I beat him twice. <br/>Ha! <br/>And when you want to  talk later, man... I'm taking orders,  bro. <br/>If you want to... If  you want to make the biggest move of this game ever in Survivor, I've got it  all laid out. Actually, I'm not a grand master in chess. And the argentine grand master of all time, guillermo vilas, he's one of the  greatest tennis players of all time but clearly has nothing to do with chess. So I could pull anything out of the '70s on these guys and they wouldn't know  what's going on. And you know what the beauty is? You don't have to make any decisions. <br/>When Marty says,  "I am a grand master in chess," I'm just thinking... Duh, like it  makes se... It does make sense, man. He's always talking about it's a numbers game, and you can see him doing all  these numbers in his head, and I'm, like, sign me up. It sounds like a good deal, you know? <br/>You can never be too  cocky, you can never be too confident. But if I can pull this off, it could be a whole new ball game. <br/>Oh. <br/>Fire this baby up. <br/>I just kept tossing  and tossing and I was, like... Oh, don't worry about  it. <br/>I know. For me to win individual immunity is good, but at the same point, the other  tribe gets to watch our tribal council, they get to eat in front of us, so  it's not gonna be a lot of fun. I just kept thinking about food and... For tonight's vote, I have individual  immunity, and the four young Espada members definitely have the numbers  advantage. So at this point, I feel like I have to go with the majority, and the choices  tonight for who we can vote for are Dan and Yve. So what are your thoughts on tonight? I'm getting exhausted with this stuff. It's very hard being here and living here. The food situation is bad, weather situation is bad, everything's bad. And I don't need the money. I got a range rover, I got a ferrari. I mean, why in the world am I doing this? <br/>When you talked to me  this morning, I guess I just want to know... That's not gonna  happen. <br/>Okay. You can't quit. I feel like Dan wants to give up, but now he told me he does not want to go  home. He needs to be honest, because if he doesn't want to be here, there's people  that want to be here. <br/>Why? What are you thinking? <br/>I mean, I think it  should be Yve that goes. I'd much rather go to the merge with Danny. I personally want to get rid of Yve tonight, because I don't want to take her  to the merge. She's a smart player. She's here to play for the million dollars. Dan, I know for a fact he's not a threat to me whatsoever, so it's really a  no-brainer tonight for me to want to vote Yve out. Regardless, us four, if we stick together... Four young. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I know. <br/>We're set. <br/>I know. <br/>The dynamic between  the four original La Flor guys is we say we trust each other, the only one I  really truly trust is NaOnka. Benry and Alina, I think they could switch like that. Best scenario for me tonight? It could possibly be to keep Yve. <br/>Here's what we're  facing. If we keep losing, we have to think about this. Yve's kind of close to me, so I think she would trust me. Dan, the only thing he could be swayed possibly by Benry to, like, blind-side  me or something. <br/>Chase and I, we are  really confused on who we would want out. If it was my choice, I would choose Dan to go home, because there's no way  that if we continue keeping him in this game, we're gonna win. Dan's knees are about to crack. He's about to start walking on his knees. [ã    \laughsã    ] sooner or later, he's about to be  walking on nubs. <br/>Holly won immunity,  and the young tribe, they're pretty tight, so it's me or Dan. And we've been to a lot of tribals when Dan's name gets written down, but  he's not voted out. Maybe he's just got a little someone sitting on his shoulder watching out for  him that I'm hoping jumps ship and comes over to my shoulder tonight. <br/>I have to tell you  girls, I sure as hell don't want to go home, and I'm here committed 100% of  the time. <br/>Well, at this point,  it's still a tribe game, so obviously, we need strong people. I think it's got to be Dan. <br/>Holly said this  morning he said "I'm done." and I'm not here to quit halfway. And out of the three of us, when we do merge, I know all three of them on the  other side more intimately than they do. Which would completely benefit you two... [ã    \indistinctã    ] so anyway, I just wanted to say that,  okay? <br/>No, I think we were  already on the same page. <br/>All right. <br/>Yve came up to me and  NaOnka and she said, "I'm actually valuable to you guys "Because  when we get to the merge, I have really good relationships with the old Espada  tribe." and I'm thinking, if we get you to the merge and you have good  relationships, what makes us think that you're not going to switch on us? Clearly, Dan isn't strong physically. But the problem with Yve is that Yve is playing really hard. So in my head I went, wow, that's the perfect argument to get rid of her. <br/>100%. <br/>Okay. <br/>I think it's always  most important to keep the tribe strong physically, but, then, at the same  time, I think that Yve might do whatever it takes to get herself, you know,  further in the game. So she could be very Dangerous. Just need to be sure this is the right thing for us to do. <br/>You guys got to tell  me what you think. I mean, this is getting down to the wire. <br/>Do not follow your  heart, follow your gut. It would be Dan, because what if we have another challenge that's super  physical and his knees hurt? Then what? First Chase wanted to vote for Dan. Now it sounds like Chase wants Yve taken out. Okay, that's what you guys want to do, tell me. Tell me right now, is that what you guys want me to do, because I'll right  her name down and I'll smile in her face. That's out-win. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. I don't know if you could have guessed it, but we always wanted to get Marty. <br/>Right. <br/>They've been my  enemies from day one. I'll do whatever y'all want me to do, honey. I'm as thick as peanut butter and jelly with the younger La Flor tribe, so I  have a little smile on my face 'cause I believe what goes around comes  around, because those two never pulled me into their alliance. They've been conniving since day one. So I hope it goes the way Brenda's planned it. <br/>No. <br/>What we're thinking  is, we got to flush the idol away from Marty. So we're thinking that we split the votes. Three votes for Marty... And three votes for Kelly B. <br/>Do we want to flush  the idol from Marty? <br/>Why not? I mean, it's Dangerous to have him hold on to it. Marty's a smart guy, he's going to use his idol tonight, okay? <br/>I don't know. <br/>He will, trust me. If you vote for Marty... I don't... Man, I  like Marty. Sash wants me to vote for Marty, but I want Marty to stick around. He's a smart guy, he's let me in on some of his secrets, you know? So I feel like I'm kind of in good with him. <br/>It's just too Dangerous  for him to hold on to that immunity idol until whenever he wants to use it. If everything goes according to plan, we'll be able to kill a couple birds  with one stone. But Fabio is so up in the air all the time, who knows which way the wind is  blowing this evening, so something could go wrong. <br/>I really want to stay  in the game. Anything I can do. I don't want to go home. I mean, are you... Hey, man, you know  what this game's all about, you know? As long as it's not me going home and you guys are straight up and really  honest about that's the way the chips are going to fall, you know, then I'm  good with that. <br/>Okay. <br/>I thought with Fabio  we could maybe shake things up, but I think it's probably too dicey, it's  probably safer to go with Jane tonight. Buys us a little time. <br/>The vote will be  determined by what Marty does with the idol. If he plays the idol, Kelly B.'s going home. If Marty doesn't play the idol, it will be a tie. And we'll have to make a tough decision, because Marty is the number-one  enemy right now, because he's a huge schemer. But on the other hand, why would you want to keep a pissed-off Kelly B. Who can win the whole thing? So enemy; Kelly B. I don't know. <br/>Uh, Fabio didn't feel  comfortable putting his vote for Marty. It's a very, very calculated decision to play or not play the idol. My gut is telling me they will vote for Jane, so I'll hang on to it. It would only buy me one more tribal council anyways. But it could very well be me going home tonight if I make the wrong decision. <br/>Jeff: Marty, obvious  disparity. Five young; three old. Even looking at this group, you and Jill and Jane, you kind of look like you  don't maybe fit in. <br/>Yeah, things changed  radically. You're in one position one day and... Just like that, it all changes. So the important thing is, this tribe is all about winning, so if you  contribute towards that and do your work around camp, I think, you know,  things hopefully go your way. <br/>Jeff: Sash, on day  one of this new tribe, what did Marty do to try to make himself worthy? <br/>Very first day, Marty  kind of called a meeting to not only introduce himself but he also mentioned  to us that he was holding on to the hidden immunity idol. <br/>Jeff: So, Marty, you  told everybody that you had a hidden immunity idol? <br/>Yeah, I mean, I  thought to get off on the best start that I could with this tribe was to come  clean and let them know, hey, listen, I have the idol, I'm going to hang it  right out on the tree, and by doing so, hopefully it bought me some goodwill  and showed them what kind of game I've been playing, which has been a really,  really straight game from day one. <br/>Jeff: Brenda, on one  hand, this is a gesture of goodwill, "I'm going to let you know I have  it." on the other hand, he's saying, "Watch out, I got it." Totally. Yeah, definitely. And so I feel like maybe is he trying to make it look more noble than it  really is. <br/>Jeff: So, Marty, now  you have to figure out, are they going to gun for me and try to get me to  play it, or are they going to tell me I'm safe, hoping I won't play it, and  get rid of me and the idol in one fell swoop? <br/>Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, you don't think I've been thinking about this a little bit, just a  wee bit, over the past few days? This game is also about trusting people that I've talked to, as far as  "Trust" gets you in this game, and, I don't know, I'm getting mixed  vibes, and it'd be terrible to go home tonight with an idol in my pocket, but  you got to trust your instincts and try to stay true to them. <br/>Jeff: Kelly B., Marty  says-- as far as you can trust someone in this game. How far can you trust someone in this game? <br/>I think, like he  said, you have to go with your gut instinct. You know, people are going to tell you what they need to, so I wouldn't trust  too many people. <br/>Jeff: Speaking for Marty  or for yourself? <br/>I mean, for anyone  here. Because, you know, everyone's got their own intentions. <br/>Jeff: And so how  comfortable are you tonight, in terms of trusting these other people? <br/>I feel pretty  comfortable tonight. <br/>Jeff: Jane, how about  you? Do you feel like you're part of the majority? <br/>I mean, they might  consider me one of the "Weaker people," as far as strength goes. <br/>Jeff: Brenda, does Jane  have reason to worry? <br/>No. She has to worry for Jill and Marty voting her out. That's the truth. <br/>I don't understand  that. <br/>Come on, Marty. <br/>Me and Jill are two,  you guys are five, so that's really sweet of you to put that on me. She doesn't have to worry about me and Jill, so appreciate all that. <br/>But what did you tell  me today? <br/>But... That's not...  That's not what we're talking about. You said what she has to worry about. What she has to worry about are numbers. These two numbers here don't add up to a lot. <br/>Five do. So you're wrong. <br/>I know, but... No, I'm just saying  you're wrong. <br/>I'm not campaigning  for Jane to be out; you guys were. <br/>I know exactly what  you're doing. I'm just saying La Flor made the call. I didn't make that call. <br/>But you did say that. <br/>So if I approached  you, it was to get consensus within your tribe to make sure that you guys are  in agreement. I never offered up Jane. <br/>Jeff: Marty, you  feeling more comfortable, less comfortable, same as you were when you walked  in? <br/>Uh, probably less  comfortable simply because I took these guys at face value and I feel there's  a lot of, uh, duplicity, based on some of the comments made here. I never initiated a vote on Jane. That would be moronic of me. That conniving and backstabbing kind of stuff that they said they didn't like  makes me feel a little uneasy, because I misJudged a little bit in the  beginning, you know, what I was seeing, so yeah, more uncomfortable. <br/>Jeff: Well, based on  what's been said tonight, I couldn't even guess who I think is going home. So let's end the suspense and get to the vote Jill, you have individual  immunity. I take it you're keeping that for yourself? Cannot vote for Jill. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. Jill, you're up. <br/>Don't ever fluff off  a southern woman. I ain't no sitting duck, honey. <br/>You're the black  widow, king cobra and black mamba all rolled into one. You may not be going home tonight, but the lines have been drawn. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally  the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. All right, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Marty. Marty. Two votes Marty. Marty. Three votes Marty. Brenda. Three votes Marty; one vote Brenda. Brenda. Two votes Brenda. Kelly b. Three votes Marty; two votes Brenda; one vote Kelly B. Kelly b. Three votes Marty; two votes Brenda; two votes Kelly B; one vote left. We have a tie. Marty has three votes; Kelly B. Has three votes. <br/>Jeff: We have a tie. Marty has three votes; Kelly B. Has three votes. Here's what's going to happen. Marty, Kelly B., you will not vote. Everybody else will vote, and you're voting for Marty or Kelly B. Jane, come get the urn. You're up first. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally  the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote... Marty. Kelly b. One vote Marty; one vote Kelly B. Kelly b. Two votes Kelly B.; one vote Marty. Kelly b. That's three votes Kelly B.; one vote Marty. Sixth person voted out of Survivor: Nicaragua... Kelly b. That's four, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Kelly b., the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. [ã    \thunder rumblingã    ] Jeff: All right,  here's what's going to happen. You are now going to listen in on the tribal council of Espada while you  feast on chicken and beef kebobs. Go ahead and move across. <br/>Going into tonight, I  was pretty sure that there was consensus on the tribe that we were, you know,  going to keep the young people together, and so to be singled out, for  whatever reason, you know, I just never got a vibe that, like, I did  something wrong. I mean, I'm surprised by the decision tonight. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring  in Espada for their tribal council. La flor just finished their tribal council. They voted out Kelly B. They're now going to enjoy a meal while they listen in on your tribal. La flor, start eating. <br/>Jeff: Chase, hard to  watch that? <br/>It's very hard to  watch that. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka, you're  not even looking. <br/>I can't look. I don't want to hurt myself by looking over there. <br/>Jeff: How is it, Fabio? <br/>[ã    \laughingã    ]: So good, man, so good. <br/>You would ask him,  huh? <br/>Jeff: Holly, tough to  sit here having to vote somebody out while watching another tribe feast? <br/>It's very hard. I'd have rather given up my individual immunity for the tribe to be sitting  over there tonight. <br/>Jeff: Dan, you can  hear the ice cubes plunking in the glasses. <br/>If it's not a  martini, it doesn't bother me. [laughter] Jeff: What does  bother you? <br/>Nothing. If things bothered me, I wouldn't be here. <br/>Jeff: Getting voted  out of this game, will that bother you if it happens? <br/>That would bother me,  yes. <br/>Jeff: So, Yve, why  would he say nothing bothers him? <br/>Because that was the  answer he gave you. But when you hear him around camp constantly complaining about the rain, the  cold-- every day something is agitating him to the brink of almost not  wanting to stay. <br/>Jeff: Dan, have you  wanted to quit this game? <br/>No. I mean, there are times when I do complain. You know, I'm out there in the middle of the night with the fire-- that's not  enjoyable. So, uh, sure I say things. <br/>But it's just  consistent, and we need more positive energy and commitment 100% of the time. <br/>Jeff: Benry, is it a  fair statement to say that Dan is a liability at challenges? <br/>Yeah. I mean, it's fair to say. There are definitely some of us on this tribe that are a little more physical  and doing well in these challenges. But I wouldn't say he's incompetent, you know, by any means. <br/>Jeff: Dan, is it fair  to say, when it comes to challenges you're a bit of a liability? <br/>I would say certain  challenges. But I'm still out there. I'm doing whatever I have to do. <br/>Jeff: Yve, what's  wrong with that logic? "I'll give you what I have. Sometimes I can't give you what you need." I give what I have  100% of the time as well, but I don't feel I'm a liability. <br/>Jeff: Do you think Daniel's  a liability? <br/>I do. I mean, I love the guy, I do, but... Really sounds it. That's a heck of a way of saying you love somebody. <br/>Jeff: Do you feel  animosity from Yve? <br/>Absolutely. And I think that she feels tonight might not be a good night for her. <br/>Jeff: Fair statement,  Yve... Fair statement, fair  statement. I do. I feel like my head's on the chopping block. <br/>Jeff: Dan, tell me  why they should get rid of Yve. <br/>Well, I guess you  could hear it in Yve's voice. She's pretty arrogant. <br/>Arrogant? What about me's arrogant? I don't talk about my ferraris and my six cars and my three homes. <br/>I do. <br/>I know. But what about me is arrogant? <br/>It's just your  overall... Just your overall attitude. <br/>Jeff: Alina, is it a  fair statement to say that it appears to be Dan or Yve that's going home? <br/>Yeah. I mean, it's been going around camp all day, do we want to keep somebody who  may be a liability for us but isn't going to be somebody who's a super  competitor, or do we want to keep somebody who is playing really hard and  just makes more competition for you? <br/>Jeff: All right, it  is time to get to the vote, which means, La Flor, it's time for you guys to  go. <br/>Jeff: All right, Holly,  you have individual immunity. I assume you're keeping that for yourself. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: You cannot vote  for Holly. Anybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Dan, you're up. <br/>What can I say, Dan? Looks like it's either me or you, and I'd much rather it be you. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally  the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Yve. Dan. One vote Yve; one vote Dan. Yve. That's two votes Yve; one vote Dan. Yve. That's three votes Yve; one vote Dan. Seventh person voted out of Survivor: Nicaragua... Yve. That's four. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Yve, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Well, based on tonight's vote, it would seem this is one unified tribe. Based on what I heard, not so sure. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for  scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on Survivor. <br/>Why don't I go up to Marty  and tell him, "Give me the idol." Jeff: Sash reveals a  crafty side. <br/>You hand the idol  over. <br/>Jeff: Jane reveals a  sneaky side. <br/>I want me a fish. I'm not gonna take him back to camp. Bon appetit. <br/>Jeff: And Fabio reveals...  Fabio, what are you doing right now? ...Too much information. <br/>I'm using the  restroom. <br/>Jeff: In the pool? <br/>It's frustrating to  be out of this game at this point. Disappointed in myself. It's not what I came here to do. Did I intend to win? That was my goal, but I certainly didn't have any anticipation of going out  so early in the game. I do think it was a mistake to let me go. Perhaps they have reasons for letting me go that I'm clearly not aware of.
