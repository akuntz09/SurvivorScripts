<br/>Probst: Previously on Survivor: In the highlands of Brazil...  Pow! (grunting)  Probst: ...two tough tribes, Jalapao and Timbira, battled it out. The winning tribe at each reward challenge got to send someone from the  losing tribe to Exile Island. <br/>Probst: But in a new twist... Brendan, choose one member of the winning tribe  to join you at Exile Island. <br/>Probst: This gave the Exiles an opportunity to form a cross-tribal alliance. <br/>We got another clue. <br/>We got another clue! (laughing)  Perfect! <br/>Probst: Which they did, sharing clues to immunity idols hidden at each of  their camps. <br/>Probst: They made plans to strengthen their alliance by bringing in Brendan's  tribemate, Sierra, and Taj's tribemate, Stephen. <br/>Do you want to be a part of the biggest upset on Survivor history? <br/>Yes, I do. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: But Brendan never had a chance to inform Sierra, leaving Taj to do it  the next time at Exile Island. <br/>Once we get to the merge, we'll have a four-way alliance that no one knows  about and can't break up. <br/>Awesome. <br/>Probst: Taj zeroed in on the whereabouts of the hidden immunity idol at  Jalapao. <br/>It's back at my home camp at tree mail. <br/>Probst: But she didn't have a chance to look for it. However...  Yes! <br/>Probst: Brendan made the discovery at Timbira. At the last immunity challenge...  Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Timbira does win immunity! Timbira evened things up when they forced Jalapao to lose another member. Sandy, the tribe has spoken. With the tribes dead even at six apiece, it's anyone's game. 12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? (Taj moaning)  Just... (grunting) Yes, right there! Yes, yes! Itchy, ooh! Ahh, yes! Oh, my God. You're doing it, baby. You are doing it. We got rid of Sandy last night. I only wrote Joe's name down on the paper at, uh, Tribal Council because I  didn't want to put Sandy's name down. I need to get some more water. I'm out of water. <br/>I'll go with you. <br/>Yeah, we can go fill up the bottles together. <br/>Right now, everything with Brendan, Sierra, and Stephen is in place. We have the Exile Island alliance intact. Our main focus right now is to find the idol. We're just set with the four people in place. Now, all we need is the extra ammunition and then it's on. Something has to be... Something must be something. 'Cause it says, "Why the sad frown?"  That's what it is: "Why the sad frown?"  That was the last clue. "You get your mail from it every day," and, uh, something  "round, and you'll ask it why the sad frown."  I swear to you... Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! I found the immunity idol, and I felt a very huge sense of relief because  everything is complete now. We have the foursome in place. We have both the idols in place. All we have to do now is make it to the merge with everybody intact. "If you intend to use the idol, you must reveal it or give it away to  someone else... the votes have been cast... " All right. I just love it when a perfect plan comes together. It's so much fun! (laughing) Okay, stuff this in your pocket. Do something with it. Hide it. <br/>Should we bury it or do you think I should put it in my pants? <br/>Um, I think we should keep it. They won't suspect you. They're looking at me. <br/>Right. <br/>So, keep it on you. Keep it on you close. Um, you know, if you bend down, be cognizant that something will show, the  shape of your pockets will show, so always protect yourself. Grab the bottle. Let's get back. <br/>Taj and I found the idol together and she immediately handed it off to me  because I was the one with pockets so I could better conceal it. <br/>Ooh, I'm sweating. <br/>Oh, my God! We got it, girl! <br/>I know, I know, I told you it was going to work out. I'm telling you, once we make it to the merge, it's smooth sailing. <br/>I mean, I'm delighted to have it but, you know, as long as it's in my  possession, I'm going to try to keep it in my possession. Theoretically and ostensibly, it is mine. I'm the one wearing the idol around my neck. (theme song playing) Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION  *  Ready to get cranking? <br/>Yeah, want me to put the beans on, get a fire going? <br/>Yeah. I gotta go down to the river and wash pots and get water and all that good  stuff, so...  Yeah, might as well get going. <br/>Okay. <br/>Are you coming, Brendan? <br/>He's working on the fire. <br/>Yeah, I'm going to get the fire going. <br/>Hey, Deb! Who's all down there? <br/>Coach and Tyson. <br/>Okay, I wanted to know if you need any extra hands. <br/>We got it, I think. Thanks. You rest. <br/>Okay. <br/>So...  Dude, you didn't tell me. I was standing there and I walk in and she's like, "I gotta tell you  about this four-way alliance." And I was like... (laughing) I'm gonna  kill you. <br/>Dude, but it works. All right, so...  Were you going to tell me? You bastard. <br/>Yes! I didn't have a chance to speak with Sierra before the challenge, so, I  didn't tell her about the plan with Taj. It could have been disaster. It could have blown the whole thing up. <br/>And then she got the clue. <br/>Yeah. <br/>She turned around to me and she showed it to me. <br/>Yep. Yep, I have it. <br/>Every single kind of stage that we've set has worked and every time we've  layered more people into the plan, you know, we've gotten more and more  powerful. Good, right? <br/>That four-way alliance is insane. <br/>Perfect. <br/>We're going down to the end no matter what. <br/>Yeah, perfect. Uh-huh. <br/>It's over. Hallelujah, praise the Lord. Amen, Jesus! After three days of being a loser when I first got here, I'm proud of myself. I formed an amazing alliance. It's really quite brilliant. We're going to take over the whole world. That's right. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Timbira getting your first look at the new Jalapao tribe. Sandy voted out at the last Tribal Council. <br/>Only a matter of time. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Today's challenge will be played in rounds. Each round, one tribe member will be seated on a spinning platform. On my "go," another tribe member will race while pulling a rope  attached to that platform, causing the tribe member to get dizzy. The dizzy tribe member must then make their way across the balance beam to  the finish line. Each time you win a round for your tribe, you score a point. First tribe to three points wins a reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: For today's reward, you will be taken to the Charmin  CafÃ    ...  Oh! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: ...where you will enjoy some nice, strong coffee, pastries. You'll also have a modern toilet and plenty of Charmin. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: In addition, the winning tribe will choose one member of the losing  tribe to go to Exile. That person will select somebody from the winning tribe to join them, which  means one person from the winning tribe will not enjoy the Charmin  CafÃ    . <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Big stakes. I'll give you a minute to strategize. Then we'll get started. Here we go. First round, for Jalapao, Joe will be pulling Taj. For Timbira, Brendan will be pulling Tyson. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, Joe! <br/>Joe, you got this, Joe. <br/>Probst: Here they go! Taj getting a spin. Tyson getting a spin. <br/>Come on, Brendan! <br/>You got it, Joe. You got it, Joe! <br/>Hold on, Tyson, hold on. <br/>Probst: Joe and Brendan very even. Gotta get up and off while you're dizzy. <br/>Whoo, whoo! <br/>Probst: Taj giving it a go. <br/>Whoa! <br/>Come on, Taj! Come on, Taj! <br/>Taj, come on! <br/>I'm coming! <br/>Hey, relax, Taj, relax. <br/>Come on, Tyson. Come on, baby. <br/>Probst: Tyson taking his time. If you fall off, you have to go back. <br/>Slow down, Taj, slow down, Taj, slow down. <br/>Oh, come on, Taj! <br/>She's back at the start, Tyson. Take your time. <br/>Hurry, hurry, hurry! <br/>Probst: We are neck and neck. Tyson and Taj, both very close. Tyson's across. <br/>Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby! <br/>Probst: Tyson wins for Timbira! Timbira up 1-zip. Playing to three. Next round, Stephen will be pulling Spencer. Coach will be pulling Erinn. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>You got this, boy! <br/>Go, Stephen! <br/>Get it down there! <br/>Probst: Coach pulling Erinn. Erinn really spinning. Stephen pulling Spencer. <br/>Oh! <br/>Go, Erinn! Erinn, off, off! <br/>Go, Stephen, go, go! Here we go. <br/>Take your time, Erinn, take your time. <br/>Breathe, breathe. <br/>Take your time. <br/>Take a second. <br/>Let it get off you. Let it get off you. <br/>That's a boy, Spence. <br/>Yeah, Spence! Keep going, baby! <br/>Take your time, Erinn, take your time. <br/>He's off! He's off! <br/>Probst: Erinn with a big lead if she can hang on. She doesn't. <br/>She's off. <br/>Come on, Spencer! <br/>Probst: Spencer now with a shot. <br/>Come on, Spence! <br/>Look at those steady little legs! <br/>Whoa! <br/>Probst: Spencer's across! <br/>Probst: Jalapao wins! Jalapao evens it up, 1-1. <br/>That was like beer goggles, man. <br/>Probst: Next round, Joe will be spinning J.T. Brendan will be spinning Sierra. Survivors ready? Go. <br/>Joe and Brendan dead even. Big sprints. <br/>Hold on, Sierra. Hold on. <br/>Atta boy, Joe. <br/>Probst: J.T. spinning. Sierra is flying. <br/>Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. <br/>You got it, Joe. You got it, Joe. <br/>Good job. <br/>Sierra! <br/>Breathe, breathe, breathe. Breathe. You're okay. You're okay. <br/>Focus, J.! <br/>Probst: J.T. trying to get rid of that dizziness. Like the end of a bad Friday night for J.T. Sierra struggling with the dizziness. Take your time, girl. <br/>You got it, J.T. Give it a go, J.T. Give it a go. <br/>Come on, girl. You got this. <br/>Take your time, Sierra. <br/>Probst: J.T. falls off quickly, Sierra with the early lead. <br/>He's way back. Take your time. <br/>He's not even on it. <br/>Relax, J.T., relax. Use your arms to balance. <br/>Probst: She can't hang on. Sierra's off. J.T. nearly across. J.T. is across. Jalapao wins round three. Jalapao leads 2-1. Playing to three. Next round, Stephen pulling Sydney. Coach pulling Debra. Timbira, got to win this round to stay alive. Jalapao wins, you win reward. Survivors ready? Go. <br/>Let's go, Stephen! <br/>Probst: This is it, Timbira's last chance. <br/>Coach, you got this! <br/>Go, Steve-o, go, Steve-o, go! <br/>Atta boy, Steve-o! <br/>Come on! Stephen, you're beating him, baby! <br/>Atta boy, Stephen! Come on! <br/>Probst: This is it. Both women are free. <br/>Come on, Syd. <br/>Take a breather. <br/>Come you, you little ballerina. <br/>Probst: Debbie up on the balance beam first. <br/>Come on, Debbie! <br/>Probst: Sydney making quick work of the first half of the balance beam. <br/>Come on, Syd. <br/>Probst: Sydney almost, but not enough. Debbie can tie things up for Timbira if she hangs on. Sydney hustling to catch Debbie. <br/>Hurry, Deb. <br/>Go, Deb! <br/>You got this, Sydney. <br/>Come on, Syd. <br/>Go, go go, go, go! <br/>Probst: Sydney is across! Jalapao wins reward at The Charmin CafÃ    . Jalapao, congratulations. Nice afternoon awaiting you guys. Let's get down to the business at hand. Who are you going to choose from Timbira to go to Exile Island? <br/>We're going to send Brendan again. <br/>Brendan going back to Exile Island for Timbira. You're smiling. <br/>It's evil to be able to pick somebody that just won a reward and take them  out of it. <br/>Probst: All right, Brendan, who are you choosing from Jalapao to go with you? <br/>Stephen. <br/>What? <br/>I love you. <br/>Oh...  Brendan, that was a classy move, man. That was classy, dude. <br/>I don't know what's going on in Brendan's head, but, uh, he's made a lot of  contact with the other tribe. Whether he's built up friendships or alliances, I don't know. But, uh, he definitely seems to have some of their respect, and it could get  dangerous. <br/>Probst: Jalapao, congratulations. Grab your stuff. Head out. <br/>Enjoy. Have some for us. <br/>Probst: You guys have a fun afternoon in store. The Charmin CafÃ     is waiting. <br/>The Charmin CafÃ    . <br/>Charmin. <br/>Yay! <br/>I like Charmin. <br/>That's awesome. <br/>Aww. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>We can lay down after we eat. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>What are these? <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God, y'all. <br/>Who wants one of these? <br/>I want one of everything. <br/>I want everything. <br/>This is so good. <br/>I was very excited to go on a reward because every time we win the reward  challenge, I end up going to Exile, every time. I'm going to eat until I hurt. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>All that food. All the coffee and the juice and the fresh water. I didn't know what to do. I forgot my name. I was just going crazy. I was so happy. <br/>Look over there. <br/>A potty! <br/>With soap. There's soap over there! <br/>I'll take this over fishing gear any day. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>It's cool getting to know my tribe because every time you go to Exile, you  just separate yourself from the tribe. But I'm not really worried about that because there's a whole 'nother story  going on with the secret alliance that no one even knows about. So, since I do have a plan B, I don't feel so nervous. You spun me around like a damn tornado. <br/>I think Taj being gone all this time really hurts her. All the rest of us, we've been able to really kind of gain some trust with  each other, and even talk strategy, and she hasn't had the opportunity to  create a tighter bond. <br/>Hey, you guys! <br/>What's over there? <br/>Oh, cool! What is it? <br/>What is it? <br/>I don't know what it is. <br/>Is that a menu? <br/>Maybe it's a gift certificate. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God. What is this? <br/>No way, dude. <br/>Oh, it is a letter. Oh, my God! <br/>From my family. <br/>Oh! <br/>Yeah! <br/>No way! (squeals)  I'm so happy! <br/>No way! "Everybody misses you like crazy."  My mom would write two pages. <br/>J.T. found letters from home, and it was not something that we expected. And it was definitely the most important reward we've had so far, as far as  just for mental strength. <br/>Aw...  To have that reminder that, hey, your family is at home waiting for you. There is something outside the game. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>All my nieces gave me something. <br/>Oh, this is good, man. (crying)  Oh, my gosh. <br/>I know, y'all. <br/>Sorry. <br/>Tears of joy. It's the first time my dad's ever said something like, "Be careful and  be safe."  She said it there? <br/>She told me at the end. I almost started crying. <br/>Yeah, I almost lost it there for...  Oh, God. Being out here for so long, you almost forget what home is like and what the  people are like that you love and to get a letter, and to just hear them tell  you that they miss you and they're proud of you and they just... Oh! That was just the icing on the cake. I would have been sick if I had to go to Exile and miss that. <br/>This is not much for us to eat, you know. <br/>Out of all the challenges so far, I wanted that one the most. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. Brendan right now, the way he's going to Exile, and the people that he's  choosing for Exile, is making strong allies. If we merge, he has control of the game, and I'm a bystander. And I certainly don't want that to happen. Feel the breeze shift? I've noticed that the wind blows this way predominantly. But when there's a storm coming, it switches directions. It turns this way. But it doesn't look too crazy because it looks like the clouds are breaking  up on the horizon. (thunder rumbles)  Oh, my gosh. Coach is kind of a jackass. He's been running his mouth about the weather at camp. I think Coach really, truly wants to be this, like, "Survivor Man."  I would not be surprised if, when this game is all said and done, Coach said,  "Gotcha! I'm an accountant. I've never left Nebraska."  So, uh, this is your Brazilian hideaway? <br/>This is my vacation pad. <br/>It's-it's quite stunning. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay, cool. So this will be fun. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Awesome. Awesome, awesome, awesome. I picked Stephen to go to Exile in order to put the final piece of the puzzle  in place. He didn't know me, didn't know Sierra, so I'm really excited to catch up with  him about, you know, how we could work together, just to make him feel  comfortable with that alliance. So this is the view from the top. <br/>Oh, man. Oh, wow. <br/>It's pretty, right? <br/>It is. <br/>It's crazy. It's like an oasis. <br/>We've got the hidden immunity idol. <br/>You brought it with you? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, nice. You guys actually have it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I was concerned she didn't have it. <br/>No. We got it this morning. <br/>You did? <br/>Yeah. <br/>When Stephen and I first arrived, we started talking immediately, and he told  me that he had the hidden immunity idol. I told him I had also had found the idol, so now this four-person alliance  has both immunity idols, which is great because it's going to put us in a  powerful spot. <br/>Yeah. So, there's more wood. We should probably just go grab more big trunks like that and load up for  tonight. <br/>Cool. Brendan. My first impression of him is positive, but wary. He's obviously an extremely strong player. He's mentally strong and he's clearly strategically strong. But, you know, it's hard to trust someone who... You know, I've known him for  five minutes. I can't place my entire faith in the game on him. So, I might keep this two-tribe alliance in the back of my head as something  that might be there, but I can't place my entire faith on this four-person  alliance. <br/>I had a crazy dream last night. <br/>About what? <br/>My boyfriend, Kelly. He had, like, a salsa... a, like, chips and salsa thing in his hand as this  earthquake was going on. It was just really strange. But it was nice to see Kelly. <br/>Right. <br/>I woke up. I'm like, "I have to marry this guy." I can't live without this  guy." So, no girls to whet your appetite? No one does it for you? <br/>None, uh... None right now. There are a lot of cute girls at U.F., though. <br/>Yeah? <br/>A lot of them, yeah. I'm not in a rush. There's, there are those people who just need to be in a relationship. They just need to have that person. I'm like, I'm not one of those people. <br/>Yeah. <br/>So I don't know. <br/>It's nice to be free. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Especially at your age. <br/>Feel like that's pretty cool. My tribe mates are not aware that I'm gay. I haven't told them, only because I feel like, in the culture that we live  in, there's nothing really to gain, or not much to gain, by people finding  out that you are gay. I figure, I've got time in the future. I'm not getting married anytime soon. <br/>Gosh, all you have is time. <br/>I know, so... I don't like hiding it, though. I would like to be able to have those conversations. When we're talking about girls, I-I wouldn't mind, you know, making like,  "Spencer, what type of guy do you like?" or something. But I know that that's not the best option for me in the game at this point,  so...  Tree mail! "Connecting with your tribe will keep you alive. Battling the others is part of the game. The meek and the slow will lose one more. The aggressive protect their flame."  "Connecting with your tribe."  "Connecting with your tribe."  Guys like J.T., typical Southerners, you know, people who are generally not  quite as accepting of homosexuality, and I don't know if he's one of those  guys, but they are maybe inclined to get rid of somebody like me just based  on fact that I am gay. <br/>This is definitely my kind of game right here. I can catch and throw anything. <br/>And that's disappointing. And it's one of the reasons why I keep it a secret. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Brendan and Stephen, returning from Exile Island. <br/>Welcome back. <br/>What's up, Stevie? <br/>Hello. <br/>Oh. You need some water? <br/>Awesome. <br/>Probst: Guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: First things first; Debbie, give it up. <br/>I missed you guys. <br/>Probst: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, two members of each tribe will alternate launching  balls out onto the course, where the remaining tribe members will catch the  ball. It doesn't matter what color the ball is. You catch a ball from either tribe, you score a point for your tribe. First tribe to five wins immunity. Losing tribe, Tribal Council, where somebody will be voted out of this game. Worth playing for? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: All right, give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. Here we go. The launchers for Jalapao: Sydney and Stephen. For Timbira: Erinn and Debbie. Guarding each other: Brendan and Taj; Coach and Joe; Spencer and Tyson;  Sierra and J.T. It's first to five. Survivors ready? Three, two, one, launch! Erinn goes short over to Brendan, who just misses. <br/>J.T.! <br/>Probst: Sydney goes deep to J.T. J.T. with a great snag for Jalapao! <br/>J.T.! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Jalapao on the board with their first point. Okay, here we go. Next round. Three, two, one, launch. Debbie goes deep. Stephen goes deep. <br/>Wow! <br/>Probst: J.T. with another great catch! Joe! <br/>In his hand. <br/>Probst: In and out, in and out. Does not count. Got to catch it in the net. J.T. snags one for Jalapao. We are now at 2-zip. <br/>Oh, boy. <br/>Probst: Here we go. Three, two, one, launch. Erinn and Sydney both release their balls. Brendan with a nice stab. J.T. just misses. Timbira on the board now with their first point. <br/>All right, Brendan! <br/>Probst: Jalapao leads 2-1. <br/>Let's go, guys. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one, launch. Both balls in the air. Brendan with a great snag for Timbira. We are now at 2-2. <br/>Taj, come on, baby. <br/>Hey, I am doing my best. <br/>Probst: Taj is wearing down. That's giving Brendan a big opening. Here we go. Three, two, one, launch. Both balls in the air. J.T. snags another one for Jalapao! <br/>Oh, he knocked a tooth. <br/>We've got a tooth out. <br/>He just lost a tooth. <br/>Probst: Ah. J.T. has lost a tooth. <br/>J.T.! <br/>Probst: Wait, J.T., did you just throw it? <br/>Probst: Let's find the tooth. Let's find the tooth. You're going to want that tooth. <br/>It's only half of it. <br/>I-I didn't see him get hit. <br/>Is that it? You want this back, J.T.? <br/>No, it-it don't matter. <br/>Probst: Here, I'll hold it. Give it to me. (Taj groans)  Oh, my God. (Sydney exhales sharply)  Are you bleeding, J.T.? You all right, man? <br/>Probst: For the first time ever in the history of Survivor, a point was  scored while losing a tooth. We are now at 3-2. Jalapao leads. Here we go. Three, two, one, launch. Both balls in the air. Tyson almost snags it for Timbira. <br/>Yeah, J.T.! <br/>Probst: J.T., unbelievable! Another catch for Jalapao! <br/>Yeah, J.T.! <br/>Probst: We are now at 4-2. Jalapao needs just one more point to win. <br/>Yeah! We got this. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one, launch. <br/>Get it, Spencer! <br/>Come on, Spence! <br/>Probst: Tyson, nice grab for Timbira. <br/>Tyson! <br/>Come on, Spence. <br/>Probst: Tyson keeps Timbira alive. <br/>Yeah, Tyson! <br/>Probst: Jalapao leads 4-3. <br/>Let it go, Spence. Let's do this. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one, launch. Debbie short, Stephen long. <br/>Get it, Spence! <br/>Probst: Tyson right there! Tyson snags another one for Timbira! <br/>Let's go, Tyson. <br/>Probst: Jalapao's lead has evaporated. We're now tied 4-4, playing to five. Whoever scores the next point wins immunity. <br/>They want them shorter, yeah. <br/>Here we go, guys. Here we go, guys. <br/>Probst: Three...  Short, short! <br/>Probst: ...two, one, launch. Erinn goes short. Sydney goes deep. Tyson scores for Timbira! J.T. just misses for Jalapao. Timbira wins immunity! (women shrieking) (J.T. grunts)  Good job, guys. <br/>Good job. <br/>My man! Mwah! <br/>Probst: Timbira, congratulations, immunity again. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: No Tribal Council, nobody going home. Grab your stuff. Head back camp. Have a good night. <br/>Good job, y'all. <br/>Great job, J.T. <br/>Probst: J.T., amazing effort, almost single-handedly won that challenge for  Jalapao. Instead, you came up short. The only thing I have for you is your tooth. Tribal Council tonight, Jalapao. Somebody going home. You have the afternoon to figure out who it's going to be. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you at Tribal. <br/>I'm doing everything I can to win. Broke the back half of my front tooth off, but it just seemed like some  people wasn't giving it all. I don't want to get rid of anyone, but it's got to be Spencer. (birds chirping)  I was hot today. I was so hot, I was exhausted. And I was hot meaning angry. Today's challenge frustrated me to no end. I just, I'm telling you, I just really felt like it was brutal. <br/>No, it's already scabbed up a little bit. <br/>Oh, yeah, it is swollen up around it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Joe and J.T. got beat up bad. And I was angry because I fell short today. I think I'm a target, but I completely believe that they're crazy to keep  Spencer over me if they're trying to keep the tribe strong because I think,  uh, Spencer, his play today was far worse than anybody else's. We're only down one. I think whatever we need to do next needs to be the best chance to make it  even, 5-5 at the merge. That means everybody needs to leave their little emotions out of it and think  for the team. Everybody. You, him, everybody. I'm-I'm hot today. So I don't give a ... what nobody thinks about me today. Everybody can kiss my ass. <br/>Can we talk through this thing? <br/>We can talk, but I just want it to be... I'm not going to sit here and talk  bull. I'm not going to sit here and talk stuff, and then we do something different  at Tribal Council. Do what's going to be best for the team. <br/>If it makes you feel any better, Taj, I trust you more than I do other people  in the tribe. <br/>Well, thank you. <br/>Me, too. <br/>I trust you, for sure. <br/>You trust me? <br/>I trust everybody here. <br/>Why haven't you never come to me for an-an ally? Why have you never come to me like that? No, you've never come to me like that. You've never said to me and said, "Let's do this together" or  "Let's try to..." You've never...  It's a two-way road, right? <br/>Hey, I've tried to talk to you. I'm not attacking you. I'm just pissed today, and I'm sick of this game, sick of it. <br/>Taj was-was hot at me. I-I really don't know why. She can bat every eyelash and raise every feather that she has, but, you  know, I think moves like that out here will get you voted off, bottom line. And if Taj has the idol, I think it's the best decision. <br/>I think she's just scared. I mean, you know, at least... she has an emotional outburst, but it's totally  honest. What do you think? <br/>I have a really tough choice ahead tonight because, theoretically, I am  better served by Taj going home without the idol because that means it's mine  to keep, but right now, Taj, she's my real connection with the Timbira side  of the Exile alliance, Brendan and Sierra. So I'm not totally clear what I'm going to do. <br/>I'm just pissed off, man. I'm so pissed off. I feel like we just let that one go. It could very well possibly be it for me tonight, but I still have the  immunity idol. And I have Steve kind of keeping an ear out for everything that's going on. He'll let me know if I really need to pull it out or not. They're down there whispering, so if you all want to get a piece, go ahead. <br/>Today's challenge was very frustrating because I'm a competitive person. And I hate not only to lose, but also to perform badly. And I knew that J.T. was probably going to be frustrated with me. <br/>I don't have any problem writing his name down because Spencer try and guess  where it was going. That was obvious. He's not going to listen to what you tell him. He's going to do it his way. He wants everybody to do it his way. His way... you know. Whatever. I just want to win, man. <br/>We have to win now. <br/>Yeah, I hate losing. <br/>It's rough around camp. It's very, very tense. And it's scary for sure because things switch so quickly in this game. <br/>What do you think, Spencer? <br/>I figured you'd come back pissed at me, so...  I was pissed at you, especially the challenge. <br/>You think I wasn't giving my effort? <br/>It didn't look like you tackled him. I said, "Tackle him."  I knew I was probably going to be on the chopping block, so...  I can't speak for the whole team. I'm just telling you how I feel, you know. <br/>I know, but, obviously, you have pull in the tribe, and... I feel like it  would be beneficial to the tribe to keep me for the next immunity challenge. I feel... obviously, I want to stay, but I feel like I'm not the worst person  to keep around. But that's... obviously up to the other five people who are voting, not just  me. Who do you think should go? <br/>I don't know. <br/>You can tell me. <br/>I think you or Taj. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about today's challenge. Spencer, how did you feel about your performance today? <br/>My performance today was pretty pathetic. I definitely felt like I let my guys down, and I was just very upset with  myself just the whole time. <br/>Probst: Taj, do you feel this tribe is still staying together well or, after  a loss, can you feel the effect of losing? <br/>We can definitely feel the the effect of losing. And, of course, everybody's frustrated, so we're just trying to believe that  the next challenge we'll be able to tie it up and go into the merge even, at  least. <br/>Probst: So how does that manifest itself back at camp? <br/>Well, initially, we all kind of blew up. Well, I won't say we all... I kind of blew up because I just felt like it was  so mismatched that... I don't know, I just felt like we could have definitely  done a better job, and I got upset. <br/>Probst: Joe, what does it feel like to have somebody walk up and start  attacking you? <br/>You don't ever like to walk into a room and have fingers pointed at you,  especially when it's not necessarily even warranted. <br/>Probst: Taj, does it worry you that you could have an outburst that could  cost you in this game? <br/>Anything you do could cost you this game. So an outburst is just another form of anything that can happen to get you  out of this game. And at that point, I felt like I was on my way out the door. <br/>Probst: And what made feel that, your performance? <br/>You know what, I don't know, it's just a feeling you get that your head is  next. And I was pissed off because, at every challenge, I do give 110%, no matter  if we lose or win, and to even have the idea that you're going to go out, and  I'm trying to figure out why. I was hot. So whoever was there was going to get it, and I didn't care who. <br/>Probst: Spencer, do you know what she's talking about in terms of just a gut:  "People aren't talking to me the same way, or they're avoiding me."   Absolutely. It definitely changes when you get back to camp, and you know that your head  could be on the chopping block. Today, I had the same feeling because of my performance in the challenge and  the frustration with J.T. during the challenge. I came back knowing that I could very well be going home tonight. It's not a feeling that is enjoyable, for sure. But I know what she's talking about, and I definitely felt it a bit today,  too. <br/>Probst: Taj, you've spent a lot of time out on Exile Island. <br/>That I have. <br/>Probst: That can work two ways: you're gone so much, they don't have any  reason to get rid of you; you're gone so much they don't know you, might as  well get rid of her. <br/>Yeah, and, I mean, what can I do about it? I don't ask to go to Exile, so it's not like I had a choice. There's nothing I can do about it except for fit in when I come back. <br/>Probst: Do you feel the target on your back, spending so much time away from  the tribe? <br/>I didn't start feeling that until maybe this week, just because we're down to  no more expendable people. I'm, like, that person, I guess, if they thought I had the idol, they didn't  think I'd need to be here because, obviously, I would be a threat. <br/>Probst: Joe, how do you deal with Taj, knowing she's been out there three  times, a lot of opportunities to find the hidden immunity idol. <br/>You can't ever be certain. She could definitely have it. I haven't actually heard her say the words, "I do not have the immunity  idol."  Would you like me to say it now? <br/>No, you don't have to. <br/>Okay. <br/>See, so stuff like that makes you think that she's really being aggressive  about hiding this thing or lying about it if she does have it. <br/>If I did say something, would it mean I did had it. <br/>No, I'm just saying, little indicators like that,  I can't win. <br/>So she hasn't slipped once, so I believe her. <br/>Probst: And yet she still has not said she doesn't have it. <br/>You want to say it for me? <br/>I do not have the idol. <br/>Okay, see, I believe her. <br/>Should I say it to everyone here? <br/>I believe her. <br/>Probst: And that is what it comes down to: whether or not you believe what  the people in your tribe are telling you. Somebody is about to find out the truth. It is time to vote. Joe, you're up. <br/>I'm pretty sure it's either me or you tonight. <br/>You played a hell of a game and I'm sorry it came down to this. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would  the time to do so. All right, once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Spencer. Taj. One vote Spencer; one vote Taj. Spencer. Two votes Spencer; one vote Taj. Spencer. That's three votes Spencer; one vote Taj. Fifth person voted out of Survivor: Tocantins: Spencer. That's four votes. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Spencer, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Bye, guys. <br/>Probst: Well, you've lost two immunity challenges in a row, two tribe members  in a row. Worse than that, you lost momentum. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

You're solid, right? <br/>Probst: Join us next time. <br/>To the strains...  Probst: ...for a special episode of Survivor: Tocantins. <br/>* Ba-ba-ba  Who is this jackass? <br/>Well, I just got voted out. I lasted 15 days, but definitely could have lasted a lot longer. I definitely made some friends when I was out there and I hope they feel the  same way. It's just frustrating that they feel like I wasn't useful enough in  challenges. It was just a really bad challenge for me today, and I feel like as far as my  attitude in tense situations. I'm going to work on that.
