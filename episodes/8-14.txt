<br/>Probst: Previously on Survivor: As the last original Mogo  Mogo member Shii Ann was in trouble...  My best chance is to call everyone on their game and stir  it up before I leave. If you make it to the final two with your current strategy, I'll  be shocked. <br/>Probst: At the Reward Challenge, a feast was on the line. Everything from a bowl of rice to a full-on steak dinner with  all the fixings. The winner will be in the charge of that menu. The game exposed the tribe's true feelings. Who does not deserve to be an All-Star? Alicia. <br/>That's a shot in the heart. I'll get 'em all later. <br/>Probst: Rupert was the last one standing, earning the  right to divvy up the meal. Back at camp, Alicia was upset at being named an undeserving  All-Star. <br/>You know, it's never fun to hear things about yourself  that aren't flattering. <br/>She's just being a big baby about it. <br/>Probst: At the reward dinner, a clear pecking order was  exposed when Rupert gave the best meals to himself, Rob, Jenna and Amber. <br/>I'm sure the fifth, sixth and seventh weren't too happy,  but, hey, what can you do about that? <br/>Probst: The next day Shii Ann was still at risk despite  her scrambling. <br/>Yeah, we should talk actually. <br/>I don't want to hear it. There's a plan, Shii Ann, and it's too late for anything to  change. <br/>Probst: With her neck on the line, Shii Ann came through  for herself at the Immunity Challenge. <br/>Yes, take that! I need this more than all of you guys! <br/>Yeah, don't get too cocky, though. You've got to live with us, Shii Ann. <br/>Probst: Shii Ann's victory meant all bets were off. <br/>Should have been cutting deals with me, stupid people. Let me just say that again: Stupid players. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Alicia, Rupert and Boston Rob  were all at risk, but in the end, Alicia was voted out. Alicia...  Yes? <br/>Probst: ...the tribe has spoken. Six are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION [theme  song playing] It's so nice out. <br/>It's so nice out. <br/>This is the first beautiful day that I've experienced here  on Chaboga Mogo and I've got to be honest. It's not really brightening my mood because the longer I stay  here, the more I realize I have very few friends and now I'm stuck in a tribe  with five other people who don't necessarily trust me or even like me, and  it's very alienating. It's really unpleasant out here. <br/>There you go. Oh, my God-- nice, fresh milk. <br/>That's it? <br/>Yup. I'm cooking, too. I'm not having plantains today. You want them, you can cook them yourself. I'm not eating them. <br/>I'm just really tired of Jenna. I cannot stand her. The girl's a bitch, let's face it, and, uh, she's bossier than  anybody else here on this tribe. <br/>I like eating off the fire, so just take it, put it on the  log and then we'll eat it. <br/>She drives me crazy. I just wanna strangle her! <br/>Rupert, you're the man. <br/>I had a couple of them that got off the spear that were  monsters, just monsters. I'd like to gut these guys. We'll come back and get 'em, clean 'em and eat 'em. When I came out of the ocean, I realized that nobody was going  to help me clean fish, but they all want to eat the fish. I'm feeling used and abused. If somebody comes up and asks which fish is theirs, I'll  probably tell them the one that they caught and the one that they cleaned. <br/>We usually get one fish per person. <br/>If everybody gutted one, they'd be all done. <br/>Rupert catches all the fish, but Rupert catches all the  fish because he's a big man who can handle those tides. At 120 pounds, those tides would literally crush me against the  He comes up and only brings one fish up to cook for himself. It was like a slap in the face. Like next time when I'm hungry, I'll cook only enough plantains  for me, because I'm doing that job. So, I wanted to tell him that I thought that was a bad move. <br/>Everybody can go down there and gut a fish and put it on  the fire. <br/>Yes. You go out there and spend that hour and a half fishing. We can't physically do that. If we...  How many fish have you cleaned? <br/>I've cleaned one. <br/>How many have they cleaned? None. <br/>But you're talking to someone who does help out. I'm just saying we're doing the other things that...  But don't be mad at me because I'm starving and come back  and put a fish on the fire. <br/>No, but my thing is all of us, Rupert. I know you're bigger. We all have the same hunger pangs. <br/>Everybody could have gotten up and cleaned their own damn  fish. <br/>I was cooking. <br/>And everybody else? What was everybody else doing? <br/>I know. I'm not talking for everyone else. <br/>My little Jenna had the nerve to bitch at me about putting  one of my fish on the grill. She's just getting really a pain in the ass, and I'm very sorry  that I have an alliance with her. Jenna just got mad at me for throwing the fish on there and  saying that I was eating in front of you guys. <br/>You know what? You eat that fish. Nobody is complaining. You can eat all those fishes. You don't have to share with us at all. I think that the dynamics are changing a lot in this tribe, and  I wouldn't count me out yet because she-devil has some tricks up her sleeves,  and I'll be playing them. <br/>Probst: Have a seat on the bench. All right. Today's challenge is for reward. And we thought this time maybe we'll show you what the reward is  before we tell you about the challenge. Amber, here's your mom, Sheryl. Come on in, Sheryl! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: Amber, get on that mat. <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: All right, Sheryl. Sheryl, just take a spot right there behind the rope. Rob, here's your brother, Mike. <br/>Yeah! <br/>You look good. You grew a beard, too. Losing weight. <br/>You too, huh? <br/>Yeah, on the South Beach Diet. <br/>Probst: Shii Ann, here's your mom, Lily. <br/>Oh, mom. Oh, I love you. I miss you. I'm sorry. <br/>Don't be sorry. <br/>This is my mom, Lily. <br/>Probst: How does she look, Mom? <br/>LILY: Great. <br/>Probst: Big Tom. Get down here and say hello to your son. Get in here. <br/>There he is, Big Dad. <br/>Oh, Tommy boy! What's happening? <br/>Mom said she's getting buff. You'd better watch out. <br/>You working? <br/>No, no. Hey, I wanted to go here anyhow. [ applause]  Probst: Jenna, here's your brother, Ji. <br/>Ji! How are the girls? <br/>They're great. They're really fine. Everyone's wonderful. Everything's great. Everyone's just thinking about you. <br/>Probst: Okay. Is that everybody? <br/>No. <br/>Laura! <br/>Probst: I'm kidding. Rupert, come say hello to your wife, Laura. <br/>JENNA M.: Oh! <br/>You just stay here for a while. <br/>LAURA: Oh, my gosh. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Probst: Whoa, Rupert. Whoa! All right, Laura, I gotta break it up. Okay, let's get to the We've put together a menu of indigenous  items from every place we've been at on Survivor. Each round will feature a different food item. Each round we will lose one person. We'll start with six, we'll work our way down to one. For the winner, here's what you get: an overnight-- loved one  and survivor. We're down to eight days. Eight days and six people, a one-in-six shot at a million bucks. You could refill their tank in a way that could be the  difference in this game. A lot at stake. And in case you haven't figured it out by now, you ain't eating  nothing. You guys are doing the eating. <br/>You got this, Ji. <br/>Oh, Mommy! <br/>Mind over matter. <br/>Probst: I'll get the first item. <br/>Mind over matter, guy. Fish heads, very popular in Malaysia. Okay. Let me explain the rules. Last person to finish is out. So the first five move on. You need to show me an empty mouth. Once I say okay, you're good. You can take a drink of water after that. Everything's got to go down. Here we go. Three, two, one, eat. <br/>Go, Ji, the whole thing. <br/>Probst: First five to get it down move on. Ji's got it all ready, all of it in his mouth. <br/>Oh, my gosh. My mom is not going to be able to finish it. <br/>Probst: Lily fighting it a little bit. It's all right. You're getting it down. <br/>Nice job, Ji. Get that down. Show him your empty mouth. <br/>Probst: Ji is good. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Lily's good. <br/>Come on, Mike. <br/>Bo is good, Laura is good, Coming down to the two on the  end, Mike and Sheryl. <br/>Come on. Three, two, one, swallow it. There it is. <br/>Probst: Mike's good. [ applause]  This way you don't have to eat anything else. <br/>Spit it, Mike. You can rinse and spit. <br/>Probst: Sheryl, now comes the hard part. <br/>I know. <br/>Probst: You got to go. No hugs good-bye. <br/>I won't. Love you. Everyone sends their love. <br/>Love you, Mom. <br/>Love you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: These are flying cockroaches from right here in  Panama. Ji, one for you and, Laura, a nice plump cockroach for you. Three, two, one, eat. Ji's good. Bo's good. Laura, Lily and Mike. Laura is good. It's between Mike and Laura. <br/>Oh, I love you. <br/>Probst: Mike is good. Lily, I'm sorry, you're out. <br/>That's okay, Mommy. You don't want to live here anyway. It's horrible. <br/>Probst: Lily, it's time for you to go. <br/>Mom, I love you. Just tell everybody I love them and I say hi. <br/>Love you. <br/>I'll be home soon. <br/>Probst: Good-bye, Lily. <br/>Love you, Mommy. Bye-bye. <br/>Probst: This is fafuru, the worst-smelling stuff in the  world. <br/>Don't smell it, Mike. Don't smell it. <br/>Probst: Fish that's been marinating in seawater in the sun  for three days. Boston Rob remembers it well, and to make it fun we'll do just  like we did in the Marquesas, hands behind your back. Here we go. Three will move on. Three, two, one, eat. <br/>Swallow it down, Mike. Just swallow the whole thing whole. <br/>Probst: Bo's face says it all. <br/>Swallow it, swallow, Mike. <br/>Probst: Bo trying to keep it down. Bo's got it. You're good. You're moving on. <br/>Ji, it's mind over matter. He's got it down. I can smell that burp. Ji's in. We're looking for one more. It's Laura or Mike. <br/>Come on, Mike. <br/>Probst: Mind over matter. Swallow. Swallow that last bit on your tongue. Mike's in. <br/>Yeah! <br/>I give you credit for yours. <br/>Probst: Laura, it's time to say good-bye. <br/>Okay. <br/>I'll be home soon. <br/>I know. <br/>I love you. <br/>Probst: Next item... tarantulas. We featured these in Thailand. They've been cooked, so they're not harmful, and only two of you  will move on. Make sure you show me that mouth and make sure it's empty. Hands on the table. Three, two, one, eat. <br/>Go, Ji. <br/>Probst: Bo not wasting any time. Shoves half of it down. <br/>That's it, Mike. <br/>Probst: No, no, no, no. Ji, I'm sorry, you took a drink of water, you're out. <br/>No one said we couldn't. <br/>Not during the timing you can't. <br/>Probst: Yeah, I did say you can't do it. <br/>Mm-mm. <br/>Probst: Yeah, I did. I clearly did. Ji, you're out. Bo and Mike you're moving on. Ji, you might not remember, but I clearly said, "Show me an  empty mouth. Once I clear you, if it comes "up, you're okay, and then  you can take a drink of water." I know you don't like the decision, but  you're out. It's time for you to go. <br/>Gotcha. I love you, baby. <br/>Love you, too. Bye. <br/>Probst: It is down to Bo and Mike. Final round, wichity grubs from Australia, and these are alive. When you have an empty mouth, completely empty, you show it to  me. You ready to do this? Three, two, one, eat. Bo shoves the whole thing in his mouth, it's down and he's in! <br/>Who's your daddy now? <br/>Whoa! <br/>Wow! <br/>Probst: Wow! <br/>Wow! <br/>You're a sick kid. <br/>I didn't even see that. <br/>Neither did I. <br/>Hey, you get this far, you might as well go after it. <br/>Probst: I like that attitude. Mike? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: great effort. It was nice having you out here. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: It is time for you to go. <br/>Bring it home, baby. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Take care, guys. <br/>Nice to meet you, Mike. <br/>Probst: Big Tom, join him out there. [ grunts]  Oh, me old son, me old son. Me old boy, me old boy. <br/>Wicked, wicked. <br/>Probst: Okay, here's the deal. We've taken Camp Chapera where you used to live and we've  upgraded it a little bit, Probably like you wish it had been when you lived  there. You're going to spend the night with pop, see what it's like  being a survivor, and hey, if it's good for two, it's better for four, right? So Big Tom, choose one survivor, we'll bring their loved one  back, and the four of you will spend the night at Chapera. <br/>Rupert. Rupert with Laura. <br/>I'm gonna pick aggravation right there. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob. Mike, get on back here. You're not done yet. Boy, it is going to be a party tonight with the four of you. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Home again, home again! <br/>Home sweet home. <br/>Wow, look at the food. <br/>That's the best thing I've tasted in the last 31 days. <br/>Here's to friends and family. <br/>To friends and family. <br/>Ooh, baby. It's good to drink beer with my I wished it had been his mother  or my neighbor's sister... after I seen what a romantic And I could have  picked old Rupert, but I couldn't have stand to see him. I've never seen a man slobber over a woman like he did his wife. There was slobber hanging down in his beard. <br/>What do you think about everybody back at camp? <br/>Me? <br/>Yeah. What do you think they're doing right about now? <br/>Amber's getting high on life or getting low on the ground. Rupert's probably kissing and hunting his harpoon. Jenna is running that mouth like a bell clapper and Shii Ann is  trying to make an alliance with a bush because she's tried everybody else. [ all chuckle]  That's all we've got left. <br/>Man, you both on that swing? Swing away, swing away. <br/>One, two, three. <br/>Oh! Swing low, sweet chariot Coming to carry me home. [ drunken yelling]  BOTH: Who's your daddy? <br/>We tore it up. We partied hard all night long. This is definitely what I needed to get to the end, just to  finish my game, you know, a little visit from home. <br/>Let's go for a walk on the beach and we'll give you guys  some time, all right? <br/>All right. <br/>To be completely honest with you, right now I'm in an  alliance with Amber first and foremost. <br/>What I got to do now is I got to get Rob and Amber to keep  me with them. <br/>I was, like, "Lex, do me a favor, keep the girl and  I'll help you out on the reverse side." He goes, "All right."  Sweet. And the dumbass actually kept her and then I snaked him. <br/>I think me and Rob might be first and second. That's all we said we was gonna do. <br/>You know who my solid is? It's Amber. <br/>Don't freakin' bank on it. <br/>I'm banked on it. Dude, I'm telling you, she won't switch. I'm guaranteeing, Mike. I guarantee. I feel it that she's not gonna. Big Tom, though...  You've got to do what you got to do. <br/>I don't trust him as far as I can throw him. <br/>Welcome home. far as I can throw him. <br/>Welcome home. <br/>Don't even tell us how it was. Did you eat pizza, Rob? How you doing? <br/>Okay, how you doing? <br/>Today, Bo and Mike came back from their little adventure  with Big Tom and Rob. We need wood! We need wood. Let's get 'em to... As soon as they came in, instead of letting  them sit down and rest and enjoy their visit here, we put them to work, got  them started, you know, helping us out at camp. <br/>That boy has been on the farm all his life. When he gets up in the morning, he knows what work is. He's used to it. <br/>On the other hand, Rob and his brother wouldn't help us  get the wood. <br/>They didn't get diddley-squat. <br/>Just take a nice cozy seat here. <br/>Go spear yourself a fish. <br/>You feeling pretty good? <br/>Yeah. <br/>This will probably be the only time you'll be in the  ocean. <br/>Is the tide deep, or...? <br/>It's not bad. I took Bo out spearfishing. Big Tom wanted him to spearfish badly, and I wasn't even going  to give Bo a spear. <br/>Okay. <br/>He won't kill you, Rupert. <br/>You know, I kind of protect those spears, even though I  don't talk about it. I protect those spears. This is hard fishing, you know. Bo wasn't the greatest swimmer. He was using the spear to propel himself more than to fish. As we were fishing, I look at Bo's spear, and the head of it is  gone. I had my flashbacks to when Sean lost his spear tip in Pearl  Island. <br/>A fine bunch of seamen. What did he do? <br/>Lose the spear. <br/>Oh, my God, no. <br/>I'm not as worried about it because I've got my spear that  is now going to be considered mine. They want to keep eating, they will let me use the damn spear. <br/>What happened? <br/>I did it. <br/>You did it? Bo is a bigger dumbass than his dad. I mean, Big Tom is pretty dumb, but Bo is just-- he's out there,  too. All right. You guys, you got to police your zone and go...  See you soon, all right? <br/>It's kind of like a dream to come down here and see my  brother. And remember, trust no one. <br/>All right. <br/>I think my brother definitely knows what he's doing, but  you know, he only has seven days to go I believe, so you're going to see a  lot of sneaky activity going on. Have fun. <br/>All right, buddy. Tell everybody I'm all set, all right? <br/>I can say once you get to a certain point, the pressure is  on you and you need to do some things and my old man, he'll fight to the end,  as long as he's walking, he'll fight so I ain't got to worry about him. <br/>Who's your mama? Berry picking bucket. <br/>Berries. <br/>Got a big-time challenge. <br/>"If you think this next challenge is buckets of fun,  you'll build your own fire, then go for a run. The first person with your flame in the sky, you'll be safe for  the vote for someone else's good-bye."  Wow. Well, we got some tree mail. It's got a bucket with a hole in it and a letter basically  saying that it's going to be buckets of fun. I know I'm still a huge target and I know if I don't win  immunity, I may be the next to go. <br/>Probst: All right. Let's get to today's immunity challenge. Shii Ann, give it up. <br/>I hate to part with it. <br/>Probst: I know you do. Once again, immunity back up for grabs. Today's immunity challenge is going to test your ability to make  fire quickly and keep it going. Here's how it works. You'll have two buckets. One bucket you will use to build fire. The second bucket you will fill with water. As you fill that second bucket, the weight of the water will  cause that bucket to drop. That will cause the fire bucket to lift. Your goal: get that fire bucket high enough to light a fuse  which will ignite the wok at the top of your structure. The first person to get their fire to light the fuse wins  immunity. Here's the rub. The bucket that you're putting water in has a hole in it, so  you're going to have to keep an eye on your fire, making sure you don't run  out of matches while you chase down more water. Make sense? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: we'll draw numbers for your positions and we'll  get started. For immunity, survivors ready? Go! Mariano takes his entire pile. So does Amber. <br/>First step is getting that fire going. Rupert's already has got fire. Shii Ann taking her time. Rupert has fire and he's going for water. Big Tom has fire. Big Tom going for the water. Rupert and Big Tom filling up their water buckets. Mariano has fire. Boston Rob, Rupert and Big Tom filling their water buckets. Jenna has fire. Shii Ann with a good fire going, building something that's going  to last. Amber still trying to get her fire going. Boston Rob's bucket is moving. This may do it. His fire bucket is up. It doesn't look like the fire is going to be strong enough. Don't touch it, let it fall. Work that fire. Boston Rob's fire went out. He had enough water but he had no flame once it went up. That's why you guys got to keep an eye on your fire, make sure  your fire is still going or you're wasting your time. All the water's drained out of Big Tom's bucket. Shii Ann's fire has gone out. Everybody is starting over. We're dead even once again. Got to tend to your fire, build a fire that's going to last. Boston Rob is down to his last match. Make sure you light something that's going to stay lit. Wind playing a factor, got to protect that flame. <br/>I'm out. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob is out of matches and has no fire, out  of the competition. Boy, even with matches you guys are having a tough time getting  fire. <br/>I'm out. <br/>Probst: Amber is out of matches. Boston Rob and Amber out of the competition. You out of matches, Rupert? <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: Rupert's out of matches. Rupert out of the competition. Big Tom has another flame. Can he keep this one going? <br/>That's it, I'm out. <br/>Probst: Jenna is out of matches. Down to Big Tom and Shii Ann and Big Tom has a fire going. <br/>I'm out of patience. <br/>Where are the fire gods when you need them? <br/>Probst: Tom, really doing a good job with the fire right  now. Patience is paying off. <br/>Go get that water. <br/>Probst: Shii Ann getting close. <br/>Nice. <br/>Probst: Each time you get a little closer, Big Tom. <br/>Come on, Tom. You got it. <br/>Probst: Shii Ann has fire. <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Probst: Shii Ann's fire getting stronger. <br/>Tom, a little momentum, not quite enough. This could be enough. This one might do it. Question is, is his fire going to be strong enough? Close, close, close, just shy. That's it. Big Tom! Wins immunity. <br/>Way to go, Tom. Very good. <br/>Probst: Came down to two and nobody gave up. Big Tom pulled it out. Turn around here, buddy. Put this on. <br/>Thank you, man. <br/>Probst: You got it? <br/>My first...  Probst: Nice job. You are safe tonight at Tribal Council. The other five of you, not as secure. Somebody going home tonight. You have the afternoon to think about who that's going to be. We'll see you all at Tribal Council. Go back to camp. <br/>I'm going to surprise everybody. Here I come. Here comes Big Tom. Here he comes. I worried myself to death. I guess like everybody I've worried myself to death... I won  immunity. I finally got one. I was proud of it. See ya later. <br/>I find the dynamics in the tribe very interesting at this  point, because now it's down to six and if anybody wants to take a power  position, they're going to have to use me as a swing vote. I mean, if you went to Rob and talked to him about voting for  Jenna instead of me, maybe, but that's pretty risky. You need to talk to Amber. <br/>Well, I've said all along, tonight I'd rather have Jenna  go. I told you that. <br/>Well, here's the thing. What I don't understand is, if you want Jenna gone, why don't  you just go talk to Amber? <br/>You're putting me like I'm a damn hero here. I can't do nothing. I'm like you. Why don't you vote her off? Me and you, we've got two votes. <br/>Yeah. I'll vote her off. <br/>All right, well, there's two. Now what are we going to do? The only way she can save herself is to get three other people  to vote off... Well, I'd like to vote Jenna off. I'd want Jenna gone because Rob and Amber pulls Jenna in, my  butt is on a highway to hell. <br/>Big Tom wants Jenna out. <br/>Yeah, he hates Jenna. <br/>He hates Jenna. <br/>I don't care who goes as long as it's not me. <br/>I'm not going to leave without trying. <br/>If you can get them to vote Jenna off, it would be  beautiful. <br/>I'm feeling out a few people. I'm trying to see if there's any way I can get a tentative  alliance. I mean, each one of them is planning to take a knife out and  stab the other in the back. So, I'll tell you who Big Tom wants to vote out, and you  tell...  Rupert. <br/>No. <br/>Jenna. If you would be willing to do that. <br/>He told me that he was annoyed with her. <br/>He hates her. <br/>But unless he voted with me, I can't do it. <br/>But would you do it? <br/>Shii Ann is talking about getting out Jenna. I don't know necessarily if I'm gonna, you know, 100% go along  with it, but I'm gonna entertain the idea, because this is the All-Star. It's, uh, hard-core. You've got to play this game, I think, more intense than you did  before. <br/>This looks like fun time for girl talk. <br/>We're just talking about the stuff I'm gonna eat. <br/>What are you gonna eat, Shii Ann? <br/>Oh, my God, so much. <br/>Shii Ann's a scrambler. I can't even deal with her. I'm very, very annoyed with her. Let's put it that way. She opens her mouth, and I feel like putting a gun in mine. <br/>No, but the only thing is, I made a deal. <br/>I realize you've got to go all the way, and if you can't  go all the way, you've got to go all the way fighting. And that is how I'm choosing to play the game. I can't wait to see what's gonna happen. I mean...  It's going to be interesting. <br/>It's gonna be real interesting, because, you know, I know  a lot of things about this tribe, and it's all gonna come out tonight at  Tribal. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury... Lex,  Kathy and Alicia-- voted out at the last Tribal Council. All right, guys, let's talk a little about roles. Jenna, who's working? Who isn't? <br/>Uh, Rupert's always working, catching fish and lugging  some wood along with Big Tom. Um, I've been the only person to go get plantains. <br/>Probst: What's Amber doing? <br/>Uh, Amber helps make the plantains. She got water, and we cook. <br/>Probst: How about Boston Rob? What's he doing to keep a place in this tribe? <br/>Boston Rob has been trying to fish, but the majority of  the work is definitely Rupert and... Big Tom combined. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob, do you agree with the assessment,  you're not really doing that much? <br/>Uh, I don't think that was the assessment, Jeff. <br/>I think I said...  I probably haven't been as productive. I mean, I've fished almost as much as Rupert, maybe not as much,  but I've tried as much. I haven't been as productive as getting them, but I'm out there  giving it a shot. <br/>Probst: Amber, do you take the past 33 days and look at  the actions of people and factor that in to who really still is trustworthy? <br/>I'm definitely factoring in the actions that people have  made in the last couple of days, let alone the whole entire game. People have changed a little bit since day one. I know for me, paranoia around camp is... it's insane, it's  ridiculous, you can't escape it, and... it's gotten to the point where I'm  annoyed with it. <br/>Probst: Rupert, are you noticing that the paranoia is  causing an annoyance to the point that it's starting to fracture  relationships? <br/>The paranoia in our tribe has at times started to rip our  tribe apart, rip alliances apart, rip friends apart. <br/>This is funny, 'cause you are the most paranoid person. [ Jenna and Rupert talking]  Probst: Wait. So what happened, Rupert? <br/>When I brought fish home, and I looked at everybody and  said, "I'm taking one and putting it on the fire right now and I'm  eating it, and I don't give a damn what anybody else does," it kind of  freaked them out a little bit. <br/>Probst: Well, it's a fair question, though. If your role is to provide fish, why should you be entitled to  the first one? Somebody else is doing fire. Do they get to sit next... closer to the fire? <br/>And if somebody's doing plantains, do they get to eat all  that they want and then you cook yours later? <br/>That is why it freaked everybody out-- because... I just  stepped up and said, "Mine."  I wasn't freaked out. I thought he deserved to eat a fish before the challenge. He went and caught it. <br/>You know, it's so funny, this paranoia about the food is  mostly caused by one person pointing it out, and that person would be Jenna. The person at camp who monitors food, plantains, fish, coconut,  who makes it, who tells us when we can make it, is Jenna. <br/>Probst: So, Shii Ann, why are you asking Jenna? <br/>You've never asked me. <br/>Jenna, stop monitoring what what everyone is eating. And if Rupert catches 20 fish and he wants to eat them all, let  him. Rupert, you deserve every single one of those fish. No one else here catches as many fish or does as much work as  Rupert. So I don't blame him for putting that first fish on the fire. I don't blame him if he wants to eat all 20 fish, because, gosh  darn it, he earned it. I mean, I'm just gonna call it as see it. The people who are remaining, there's two power pairs, right? There's Rupert and Jenna, there's Rob and Amber, there's no  secret. I keep wondering why they've decided not to take Tom and I, who  are swing votes, to eliminate one of the two of the power pairs. You know, take one power couple and just cut it up. <br/>Probst: you got everything out? <br/>No, uh, what should I say? No, I... See, I'm very torn tonight about who I should cast my  vote for. Whether or not I should cast a vote for the person who I found  most annoying on the tribe, or... if I should cast a vote for the person who  I think might win this game, and point them out. <br/>Probst: When you say, by making that vote, you'll expose  them? <br/>Well, I'm not... By making that vote, I will be making a  statement. You know, I'm just going to say this. Tonight I'm going to be casting my vote for the person who I  think is playing the game the best, for the person who I think everyone else  on the tribe should be looking out for, and for the person who I think, if  people don't watch, will win the million dollars. So maybe this will help shake it up. <br/>Probst: Is that your goal? <br/>Yeah. I love the unpredictable. I want to see what happens. <br/>Probst: Big Tom, you have the coveted immunity. Formally, I will ask you if you want to give it up. <br/>I don't... That's the ignorantest thing that's been said  here tonight. No-no offense to you, but, no, I don't want to give it up. <br/>Probst: Big Tom gonna hold on to immunity. You cannot vote for Big Tom. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to find out what exactly is going on within this  tribe. Boston Rob, you're up. <br/>It's time for you Boston Rob, you're up. <br/>It's time for you to go, and if you're wondering if you  can eat and how much you can, because you think that I monitor that, eat a  lot, Shii Ann, eat a lot. <br/>Amber, this vote is Ann, eat a lot. <br/>Amber, this vote is for you out of respect. You are the mastermind right now, so from one she-devil to  another, this is the vote I'm casting tonight. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Shii Ann. Shii Ann. Two votes Shii Ann. Amber. Two votes Shii Ann, one vote Amber. Shii Ann. Three votes Shii Ann, one vote Amber. The 13th person voted out of the tribe... Shii Ann. That's enough-- you need to bring me your torch. Shii Ann, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Good luck, everyone. <br/>Probst: It's time for you to go. Well, Shii Ann went out of this game playing until the very end. Obviously she wanted to stir things up a little bit in camp. Guess the next few days will show us what, if any, impact her  words had. Grab your torches. Head on back to camp.

Did you or did you not tell me we needed to get Rob off? <br/>The she-devil did her best. I really tried. I played this game as hard as I could. I played with the best of the best, but you know what? I knew I was outnumbered, and I knew they were gonna vote me  off, so I just wanted to warn everyone, don't forget little Amber with her  big green eyes and her beautiful smile. Don't forget, she's playing for a million dollars.
