<br/>Episode 12 -  <br/>Jeff: previously on "Survivor":  Ometepe shall live long in "Survivor" lore, as  long as we stick together. <br/>Jeff: Since the merge, the former Ometepe tribe has been  unstoppable. <br/>We're guaranteed to go to the final six. <br/>We have the numbers, so it makes perfect sense to take out  the Zapatera people one by one by one. <br/>Jeff: They've won challenge after challenge. Grant wins immunity! Andrea wins. Rob wins immunity! And whittled the former Zapatera tribe down to two. <br/>Ho, ho, ho. <br/>Jeff: The only crack in their alliance appeared when Phillip's  antics got to be too much. <br/>Every time I make an argument with one of those guys I'm [  bleep ] crazy. <br/>He just brought in the race card. <br/>Jeff: Andrea also came under fire when she continued to  show an attachment to Matt. <br/>Andrea still has a soft spot for Matt so it just makes  sense to get her out. <br/>Jeff: But at the last tribal council, they took out Ralph,  and in a second, surprise vote, the Ometepe six did what few alliances have  done before-- Steve, the tribe has spoken-- stick together from the beginning  and decimate an entire tribe. Now they face their most fearsome enemy yet-- each other-- and Steve  and Ralph head to Redemption Island where they will face Mike and Matt in the  first-ever four-way duel. <br/>Hey, guys. <br/>Ralph! <br/>What do you say? What do you say? What do you say? <br/>There he is. How are you, man? Good to see you. <br/>What's been going on? <br/>What's been going on? Me and Steve fighting with Phillip for a little rice and all  that good stuff. I bet you Steve lost 40 pounds. <br/>PRobably. <br/>I mean, he's pitiful. He didn't think he was going to make it back to camp today after  the game. <br/>Wow. <br/>I don't know. <br/>Hey. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You guys got room for one more? <br/>Steve! <br/>Steve! <br/>What up, brother! <br/>What are you doing? <br/>We were just talking about you. [ laughter ]  I'll tell you what, Redemption Island keeps on getting  crazier and crazier. <br/>Lordy me! <br/>We've got the three remaining Zapatera here at Redemption  Island. And Matt. <br/>I've missed you, man. <br/>It's just so nice to see three of the really friendly  faces compared to the Ometepe tribe. I just did not want to go back there tonight. <br/>Six Ometepe left. <br/>Wow. <br/>What are they going to do now? <br/>The jury is going to be all Zapatera. <br/>All Zapatera. <br/>Julie, David, myself, Matt, Ralph, Steve. That's six right there. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>I see daylight ahead now. If one of us Zapatera guys gets into the top three, we've got  this thing won. And I want to be that guy. So I'm going to give it all I've got. <br/>Yeah, yeah! <br/>Whooo! <br/>Tribal council was pretty much amazing because in one  tribal council, we got rid of the remaining two Zapatera tribe members so now  it's just the Ometepe six. <br/>Ometepe! <br/>It is a little scary that now we have to take out one of  our own, but it's also a little exciting because for the last, what, five  votes we've been on cruise control so now we can actually get into the game  of which I'm excited. <br/>Hey, nat, you okay? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Is it happy tears or sad? <br/>I don't know. It's hormone tears. <br/>I'm sorry. <br/>I think I started getting kind of emotional just because  now we have to start knocking everybody off, and from there, it just, like,  started thinking about home and missing my family, missing my friends,  missing regular life. I just don't want you to think I'm crying because I'm-- like I  don't want to be here or anything. It just has nothing to do with--  You're just having a moment? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's okay. <br/>Yeah. <br/>There have been times out here where Natalie has just been  mature beyond her years and then there have been other times when, you know,  her youth just shows through. She's 19. You know, being out here for 30 days, it takes its toll on you. And it's critical for me to comfort her. I mean, she's my main alliance in this game, and I want to make  sure she's all right. We're concerned about you, and we care about you, and, you know,  when we see you all of a sudden start to cry for no reason, we want to know  what's wrong. I've got eight days left, eight days. I've just got to keep everybody happy, and as long as they don't  start talking to each other and realize that I'm the one that should be  going, I'll be all se set. <br/>Tree mail! Sprint open first. <br/>Oh, my god! Is this family? <br/>We got tree mail this morning and we got a box, and on the  top of the box it said "Sprint. <br/>Oh, my god. You've got to be joking me right now. <br/>Cell phones, baby! <br/>"Another got voted out but are they out for sure? Come to the arena and see who will leave and who will endure. First, check videos for a surprise."  Yeah! <br/>No! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>We got, like, a message about the duel which we kind of  discarded because then it said, "Check videos."  Everybody be quiet. <br/>Hi, I'm tracy, Natalie's mom. It's hard that you've been gone so long, and I'm so proud of you  that you stuck this out, and we all miss you. Daddy's very proud of you. I hope that you are strong. I can't wait to see you. I love you. <br/>Natalie was a little upset, you know, after we got out of  tribal. And it was perfect timing for her and really for all of us. <br/>My daddy! <br/>Hi, Andrea, we all miss you. Your sisters can't wait to see you again. It seems like you've been gone so long. We'll see you soon. <br/>Oh! <br/>Beautiful! <br/>I'm tracy, Phillip's sister. I just want to tell you how profoundly I miss you. We are all thinking about you. We're on your side. <br/>Hey, Rob. We are so proud of you. You have made it so far. Mom and dad send their love. Stay strong. You've done a great job. We're so proud of you. <br/>Grant. <br/>That's my sister's husband. <br/>You should know that adrien, she is newly pregnant. Good luck. Win this game, and come home. <br/>Hey, Ashley! Oh, my gosh. We all miss you so much, honey. Love you and come home safe to us, sweetheart. Hang in there. <br/>Oh! <br/>Come here! <br/>It's day 31, and, like, you feel exhausted, but when you  hear from home, it just lifts your spirits so much. And it was a really, really good surprise. <br/>Sprint 4g, follow the path to the arena where you will  compete in a duel. Check videos for a surprise. <br/>Oh, my goodness! The videos! Tree mail today, I thought it was just going to be walk out  there, maybe get a note to a duel. But oh! We're going to get to see videos of our loved ones. <br/>All right. <br/>Hey, Ralph. Having a good time? I want you to know we all miss you here at home. All the cows are doing great. A couple of the chickens got killed, though. Hope you're not upset about that. We're really proud of you. Can't wait to see you back home. <br/>That's awesome! <br/>We all miss you and hope that you are-- you are well, and  you are safe. <br/>I've never gone for 31 days without being able to speak to  any of my family, even when I was in the marine corps. We could still reach out via e-mail. So it was really touching to see a message from my mom. Love you, mom. <br/>Hey, brother, just wanted to let you know that the folks  are wishing all the love for you. We're thinking a lot about you. I'm going to get emotional here. A big steak and cold beers are on me next time we see each other. <br/>That's awesome. <br/>Hey, Matt. I just want to say love you. I hope you're healthy. I hope you're staying strong. <br/>I just see my brother and I'm just thinking-- I just want  to die right there, just seeing him. <br/>We all love you and miss you like crazy. Can't wait to see you very soon. <br/>It makes every struggle, every hard time I've gone through  on Redemption Island completely worth it. <br/>Three, two... That's it. If there's a chance that I can spend any time with me brother, I  will do anything I can to win today. <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the competitors for today's duel. Matt, Mike, Ralph, and Steve. Good morning. <br/>Good morning. <br/>Jeff: This morning in tree mail, both camps received the  epic 4g, only from sprint. I will take the phones back. Grant. So love from home on a sprint phone is pretty nice. That's what we learned. Love in person will be even better. <br/>Don't do this. <br/>Jeff: The winner of today's duel will get the opportunity  to spend some time with their loved one in person. First, you gotta win the duel. It is a four-person duel, first time we've had one of these. Here's how it works. You each have four tiles. Each round, you will toss a ball trying to break a tile. The first three people to break all their tiles stay alive in  this game. The loser is out for good, their quest for the money is over. In addition, the first person to finish this challenge wins love  from home. [ applause ] there is a lot at stake. This is it. One shot, take your spots. Let's go. The way this will work, you'll throw, one person at a time, in  rounds. Matt, you're up first. Matt a little chip, that won't do it. Mike. Mike one toss, breaks his first tile. Ralph makes a toss, very close. Steve short. At the end of the first round, Mike has one. Everybody else nothing. Matt, you're up. Matt breaks a tile. Mike breaks his second tile. Ralph breaks a tile. Steve breaks a tile. At the end of this round, Mike has two tiles broken. Everybody else has one tile broken. Matt, you're up. Matt breaks his second tile. Tying him with Mike. Mike breaks his third tile. Ralph breaks his second tile. Steve just misses. Here's where we stand now. Mike has three tiles broken. Matt has two broken. Ralph has two broken, and Steve has one broken. Matt, you're up. Oh! Just misses. Mike could win the duel right here. And he does! Mike not only stays alive in this game and on Redemption Island. Mike has just won the opportunity for for some in-person,  up-close love from family. It is now down to Matt, Ralph, and Steve. Two more people are going to stay alive in this game. One of you will be going home. Ralph, you're up. Just misses. Steve. Take your shot. Steve short again. Matt has two tiles broken. Looking for a third. And he gets it. Ralph has two tiles broken. He's looking for a third. And he gets it. Steve needs to get a second one right here. And he doesn't. Matt and Ralph both only have one tile left to break. Matt stays alive. He joins Mike. Ralph, break this tile. You stay alive. And he does. Ralph will live to see another day on Redemption Island. The journey for Steve has come to an end. Mike, first of all, congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Surviving another duel and winning some love. Steve, unfortunately, the game is over, but you are not going  home. You are going to be a member of the jury. Take your buff. Put it in the urn. See you at the next tribal council. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. [ applause ]  Bye, Steve. <br/>Jeff: Now to the reward part of this duel. Mike, come on over here. So as part of winning this duel, you have won time with your  loved one, your mom, jane. Let's bring her out. How's she look? <br/>Amazing, as always. <br/>Jeff: So your mom is 10 feet away. But before you guys embrace, you have a decision to make. If you want, you can forgo your own love with your mom, and  instead you could try to buy some good will in a jury situation should you be  the one that reenters the game by giving the love instead to the two guys  you've been living with out here on Redemption Island. <br/>What's up! <br/>Jeff: There's Matt's brother burton, and Ralph's buddy,  ronnie. [ applause ]  Ralph. <br/>Jeff: That's your first choice. Your second choice is you can instead give love to everybody  left in this game. <br/>Oh! <br/>There's Andrea's dad. There's Grant's brother-in-law. Steve. That looks like Rob's sister, heather. There's Natalie's mom. Tracy. Phillip's sister, tracy. And Ashley's mom, terry. So, Mike, very big potentially million-dollar decision. Take me through the thought process. <br/>The decision is almost clear in my head. Yesterday, I was reading it was either Matthew or mark, and  jesus was asked of all the commandments, what are the greatest? And he responded, "Love your brother like you would love  yourself." so I think if I give the most good to the most people and  make friends from enemies, I think that's the only play here. <br/>Jeff: let me make sure I'm clear on what you're doing. You're giving up your love with your mom, and you're giving up  the love for Ralph and Matt, and you are giving it to the six people who  singlehandedly decimated your tribe. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: I gotta tell you, I thought the odds of that  happening were less than zero. Jane, does this decision surprise you? <br/>No. This is who my son is. He is a hero. Honey, I'm so very proud of you. <br/>See you soon. <br/>Jeff: All right, jane, burton, ronnie, time for you guys  to head out. <br/>Matt, stay strong. Love you. <br/>I love you, honey. <br/>See you soon. <br/>Okay. <br/>Bye, you guys. <br/>Jeff: All right, so, you've made a huge decision in the  game. I hope it pays off for you. Mike, Matt, Ralph, grab your stuff. Head back and await news of your next duel. <br/>Thank you, Mike. <br/>Thank you, Mike. <br/>You're welcome. Don't vote me off again. [ laughter ]  Jeff: Only one thing left to do-- join your loved ones. You guys will head back to camp and spend the afternoon  together. <br/>Today I would have accepted if Mike would have kept his  mother and hung around with her the rest of the evening, no hard feelings  whatsoever. But I'm sure he's looking for winning a million dollars and was  hoping to pull in more votes, so he let family see them six and that really  pissed me off. That was very hard, Mike. You have the old feather in the game. That's what you're looking for. <br/>It's not. <br/>It sucked. <br/>I think it was kind of stupid, him and the good lord,  whatever. He said that's the way he wanted to do it. That's something he has to live with. But if I had been in his shoes, I would have spent it with my  mom. <br/>Mike, I'm glad I didn't win because I couldn't have done  that. I mean--  The way they treated me--  Yeah, I mean, seriously, me, too. <br/>I wouldn't have given it to them. <br/>I asked god to help me win and I think that's what he  asked of me. The decision I made today was not a strategic one. It wasn't to earn the good graces of the Ometepe tribe. It was just the right decision to make and the right thing to  do. If I make it deep into this game and it earns me a vote or two  on the jury, then that will be a great bonus. I'm sorry, guys. <br/>No, no, don't be sorry. Man, that's more than I've done the whole time I've been out  here, just that one moment, you know. <br/>I feel bad for Matt and his brother, Ralph and his friend,  but I've apologized to them for that. That's the best I can do, and it's hard for me know I've let my  friends down, but, you know, it is what it is at this point. [ cheers ]  This is our shelter. <br/>I'll show you where we sleep. <br/>Walking into camp with our loved ones feels so surreal. I got to show my mom where I've been living, and it was just  like everything I needed, and so much more. <br/>I keep the calendar every day. <br/>Oh wow. <br/>I mark it off. Like, yesterday, was 30. <br/>Everybody says, "Tell him we love him!"  Okay. <br/>Tell him we're so proud. <br/>Cool. <br/>How do you keep your hair so nice? It's looking great. You're wasting money all these years. <br/>Adrien sends her love. She wishes she could be here. I wish everybody should see this. <br/>It's so motivating, actually physically seeing somebody  and hearing them talk to you and being able to look into their eyes, it's  priceless, man. <br/>I'm fine. <br/>I know. <br/>I have never been away from home more than two weeks. I've talked to my mom every day, so it was just good to see her  and for her to tell me how she's proud of me and how my family is doing back home. And it just made me feel like I-- I can do it, and I can push  through the next seven, eight days. <br/>This is a social game. <br/>Right. <br/>I'm prepared to go crazy if I have to. That's what works for me, you know. Just seeing my sister and seeing her confidence in me empowered  me and renewed me at another level to continue to dominate. Continue to dominate. And be who I am. <br/>Phillip's a nut job. He's a whacko, but he's, like, the biggest goat. He's pissed everybody here off. <br/>Oh, really. <br/>If I drag him to the end, he doesn't get any votes. <br/>Right. <br/>You know? But you have to, like, always adjust your strategy day by day. Grant thinks it's me and him. Natalie thinks it's me and her. All they have to do is talk to each other, but they won't, you know. I feel like right now I'm playing my best game, but even  everything that's happened up until right now, means nothing unless I can  finish it. I need this. It's to make a better life for my wife and my kids. Even though we're at a point now where some people might be  taking a break from the game and thinking about home, it just makes me focus. I want to win "Survivor." this is something I've been  trying to do for 10 years now. I'm eight days away. So there's nothing that's going to stop me. <br/>Ba-da-bum! Good morning, tree mail. Rise and shine. It says, "Feeling pressured to step it up? Is strategy on the rise? It's an uphill battle, no Matter how you tread when immunity is  the prize."  There's three in a row. <br/>This morning we got tree mail, looks like another immunity  challenge. But tonight, I feel like it's not going to be too difficult. There's just one person that can't win today. The vote will pRobably go towards Andrea. She's great at the challenges, and strategically, she pRobably  knows more about this game than everyone except Grant and I. Therefore, she's got to go. My sister gave me a shirt with amber and my daughter, lucia, on  it, and I'm going to work my ass off to make sure Andrea doesn't win  immunity. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! Looks a little daunting? <br/>A little bit. <br/>Jeff: Guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>We are. <br/>Jeff: First things first, mariano, once again, I'll take  it back. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you are going to race to collect a series  of puzzle steps. You must then place the steps in order from bottom to top,  completing a very tall staircase. First person to finish their staircase and get to the top wins  immunity and is safe at the vote. Losers, tribal council where somebody will be voted out and sent  to Redemption Island. I know it's worth playing for. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. Whatever you have in your tank you need to use right now. Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready? Go! First you have to untie the knots. Then you have to get these puzzle steps to your plank. Then you've got to figure out which one goes first. Rob's got his first board in. Grant has one in. Andrea's in it. If you're wrong, you've got to go back down. You can only bring one plank at a time. You've got to know what you're doing or you're going to lose  time. Andrea in the lead. She's moving on to her second set of steps. Rob has his first set. Grant finishes his first set. Ashley going to finish up her first set. Phillip is going very slow. Natalie having no luck at all. It is Rob, Grant, and Andrea working on their second set of  puzzle steps. Grant's wrong. He heads back down. Andrea has her first step. Rob has his first step of the second set. Ashley struggling to stay in this. Grant has his first board. Andrea now in the lead with her second board. Rob picked the wrong board. Gotta go back down. It is Andrea and Grant right now. You need to pick it up if you want to win! Second place buys you nothing in this challenge. <br/>No! <br/>Jeff: Andrea with a big mistake. She grabbed the wrong board. It is Rob and Grant now. Grant has his second set finished. It's about 110 degrees today. Adding to the difficulty. Rob has completed his second set. Grant has completed his second set. Grant working on the third, and final set of puzzle steps. Andrea's completed her second set. Phillip, Ashley, Natalie, have fallen out of this challenge. Grant is wrong. He's going to have to head back down. Once again, the lead could change. Rob has it right! Andrea has hers right! Grant is wrong again! Two mistakes for Grant. Opening the door for Rob and Andrea. Andrea has her second board, Grant has his first board. Rob struggling to get up these steps. He is literally carrying his family on his back! Grant now making up ground. Grant has his second board. Rob has his third board. Andrea right behind. Andrea's going to need a mistake from Rob. Grant has his third board. Rob has his fourth board in place. Rob has two steps left. Grant has three, Andrea has three. It is Grant and Rob. Tied. Both with two steps left. Andrea now with two steps left. Rob his legs nearly buckling, crawling up these steps. Rob has one step left! Grant has two! Andrea right behind. As long as Rob can get up, he will win this challenge. Grant has one step left. Andrea, she's got one step left. Rob with his last puzzle step. Struggling to make it up without collapsing. 32 days of exhaustion setting in. Grant racing to the top. This is it. Rob crawls to the top. Mariano wins immunity! Great effort from everybody. You all right, Rob? <br/>It's hot. My legs are burning. I'll live, dude. Let's go. <br/>Jeff: No, no, no, relax, man. <br/>Some water? <br/>Jeff: Got it? Are you cramping? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh! God help me. <br/>Jeff: Do you want me to have medical look at you? <br/>No. I think if I could stand, it would be better. <br/>Hey, could you guys help me stand up? Yeah, that's better. I'm all right. I'm all right. Let's go. We'll go back to camp. Let's go. <br/>Jeff: Mariano, can you hobble over here? <br/>Yes. [ applause ]  Way to go, Rob! <br/>Jeff: Once again, barely standing, mariano safe at  tonight's tribal council. As for the rest of you, after 32 days together in one solid  group of six, this alliance is about to be broken up. See you tonight at tribal council where somebody will be voted  out and sent to Redemption Island. Take care of yourself. <br/>Thanks. [ applause ]  Oh, man, my legs are like jell-o. <br/>I know. <br/>I thought it was like-- I couldn't breathe, you know? Physically, the challenge, I had to literally give everything I  had. Afterwards, I thought I was going to die. But I figure, I'm seven days away. And I'm giving it everything I got. One of us has to go to Redemption Island. I mean, that's a fact. There are two main things that I gain from winning immunity  today. Number one, I'm not going home no Matter what. And number two, all my options are open, and I can decide who's  going home. <br/>So we're all good, right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, right? <br/>Tonight we're going to vote off Andrea. She's one of the strongest competitors in the challenges, plus  her relationship with Matt on Redemption Island is still a threat. <br/>Are we voting Phillip? Is that the plan? Like, for sure? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It will be a shock to her, I think, but there is no more Zapatera  left at camp. So she needs to go. <br/>She has no idea. She's not going to see it coming. <br/>Lovers are going to be reunited. <br/>Phillip, somebody's going to come back from redemption,  and I don't want them sleeping next to me. <br/>There's plenty down on the side there. They'll have to patch it up. <br/>We're all completely set on getting rid of Andrea, and  then all of a sudden, Phillip regains his spot in our tribe as annoyance  number one. He started driving everyone crazy. <br/>There's a wasp near you, be careful. Don't move your arms so quickly. <br/>Don't yell at me! <br/>I'm just trying to tell you when you do quick actions  around them that upsets them. <br/>I'm not stupid. <br/>Well, you were moving your arms quickly. <br/>Straight back to normal felipe. <br/>I'm telling you man, that feeling in my stomach hasn't  changed since day one. <br/>I could be wrong, but I'm not concerned about going home  tonight because early on in the game, I made myself the villain. So that everyone in my tribe feels that their best chance of  winning against anybody is me. It's brilliant strategy, and I need to kind of put a little salt  on that wound every now and then to make sure folks don't forget that. These fishnets remained in place, the entire time. All of a sudden, both of them end up like this. You mangled my net. I'm worried about your roof? The hell you say? I think Rob feels very strongly that if it's him and I in the  final, that he can win the million dollars. But I have an oral argument that nobody here on my tribe,  including him, has thought of it. I know exactly what to say to make everybody think twice about  voting for him, regardless of everything else I've said. Honestly, I think I could defeat Rob. <br/>Dude, we're almost there. It's pretty simple, right? We get rid of Andrea tonight. <br/>I don't know. I don't want to rock the boat, but I'm thinking maybe we should  vote out Phillip. It's just that since day one, there's something I haven't  trusted. To be honest with you, I'm having some second thoughts as to who  I want to sit there with at the end. If I were to keep Phillip around, he's terrible in challenges. And he's a goat, perfect person to take to the end. At the same time, Phillip could be playing me. He's pretty good with words. He's a good speaker. So when it comes down to the jury, that could be a pRoblem. Is he that good? I don't know. <br/>Has he said anything to you? <br/>He hasn't said anything at all. On the other hand, Andrea's a competittor. If she sits at the end she could possibly beat me. If I make the wrong decision, 32 days of hard work could be gone  just like that. <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the members of our jury. David, Julie, and Steve. The time has finally come. After dominating for 32 days and voting everybody else out of  this game, this tight group of six has to vote one of their own out of this  game. Andrea, concerned at all as we sit here right now? <br/>For myself? <br/>Jeff: Yeah. <br/>I feel confident in the relationships I've built within  the Ometepe six, so I feel safe tonight. I mean, you can never be certain in this game, but as of now, I  feel like I'm trusting the right people. <br/>Jeff: So, Natalie, is it kind of exciting to be at tribal  council? Is it terrifying? <br/>It's a totally different tribal council tonight. It's nerve-racking. It's scary. And it's not fun. It's definitely not fun tonight. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, you made a point about saying, "I'm  the sixth man on this group, and I'm fine with that." well, there's only  six people left. So it seems like there's a very good chance it should be you  tonight. Is there any part of you that might be lying down and saying,  "You know what? I don't even want to look like a threat." because you and Natalie  weren't even competitive today. <br/>Today, it was 110 degrees. I'm a 52-year-old man. Clearly, on that particular event, I was out of my league. I've been waiting and hoping that we would do something that  required upper body strength because when I went in the army, at 29, out of  1500 men, no man could outrun me, do more push-ups, more sit-ups. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, I'm making the argument the reason to keep  you is because you aren't a threat and you raise your hand and say, "I'm  a huge threat. I just haven't had the right challenge." Andrea, you were  very competitive today. Are we at a point in the game where ability to be competitive  still might make you a target because you could win your way to the end? <br/>I realize that it's an individual game but we also want to  keep our tribe strong because whoever is coming back from redemption, we need  to beat them. <br/>Jeff: So, Grant, are you having to play your own  psychological game of this is why you should keep me and not get rid of me. <br/>To a certain degree. I came into this game knowing myself and this is who I am. There's one thing you can't take away from anybody, if they're  being themselves, their true selves you can tell and if they're being fake,  you can tell that, too, and putting on a front just to say, "Hey, I want  a million dollars."  Jeff: Phillip, share with me some insight based on your  background as counter-intelligence, at this point in the game, can you make  it to the end if you are truthful? <br/>Absolutely. I'll make the case with myself. I have formed no alliances where I, you know, broke them. I think everybody knows me to be, you know, the senior  statesman. I'm a guy who leads by example. Don't know for sure, but I think I'm a guy that you want to have  around. <br/>Jeff: here's the great thing about the vote tonight,  unless I'm wrong, does anybody truly feel insecure at this moment? Rob, that's the pro and the con of what you guys have built. The pro is you were so solid, you were able to destroy another  tribe. The con is you're so solid, somebody's about to get blindsided. <br/>Yeah, I mean, and this is a tough decision tonight, but I  feel a lot better with this around my neck. But I'll tell you, had Grant won this today or anybody else for  that Matter, I would be feeling it. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, before we vote, share one little nugget  that you think your great-grandfather would say if he were here right now. <br/>He'd say, "You've done everything right to get to  this point. Hold the faith."  Jeff: Okay, it is time to vote. Rob has the necklace. You cannot vote for Rob. Everybody else is fair game. Natalie, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Andrea. Phillip. Andrea. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Jeff: Two votes Andrea, one vote Phillip. <br/>She got blindsided. <br/>Jeff: Andrea. That's three votes Andrea, one vote Phillip. 14th person voted out. Andrea. That's four. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Tricky, tricky. <br/>Jeff: Andrea, the tribe has spoken. You will have a chance to get back in this game. Grab your torch. Head to redemption. Good luck. Well, that's one blindside. I have a feeling it won't be the last. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor":  And then there were five! <br/>I love blindsides. <br/>Jeff: This close to the end. <br/>Splitting them up is the best route. <br/>Know that I have your back. Ashley can't be trusted. <br/>Jeff: Every...  That is a snake, bro. <br/>Jeff: Moment...  I don't give a [ bleep ]. <br/>Get out of our face. <br/>Jeff: Counts. <br/>One thing you don't want to happen, it happened. <br/>Well, obviously, I'm a little bitter. All of them, except for Phillip, you know, looked me in the eyes  and said we're voting Phillip, and somewhere during the day they all went  behind my back and said we're voting Andrea. It is really hard to be living with these people for 32 days and  have these relationships and what you think is trust and find out that  they've been lying to you the entire time.
