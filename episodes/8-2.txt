<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously, on Survivor... For the first  time, 18 former castaways return to the game as three tribes, Chapera, Mogo  Mogo and Saboga. And they soon found out just how crucial fire would be. [ grunting]  This ain't a little boy's game. This is for the big boys. <br/>Probst: Because no fire meant no water. <br/>You can't drink it right out of the well. There's potential brain parasites. <br/>Probst: At Saboga, Rudy approached Rupert with a plan. <br/>Me and you ought to think about an alliance. <br/>He and I will stick together through the end of the game. <br/>Probst: And at Chapera, Boston Rob and Amber made a  connection. <br/>What do you think? You want to make an alliance? <br/>I don't know if I can take you seriously or not. <br/>I'm being 100 percent serious. <br/>Probst: Go! In a very close immunity challenge, Saboga fell behind, giving  Chapera and Mogo Mogo shared immunity. [ cheering] Back at camp, Jenna campaigned to vote out the  previous winners. <br/>Tonight, I think it's important to take out the two winners  first. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Ethan felt vulnerable. But Tina was the first All-Star voted out. Tina, the tribe has spoken. With all the tribes denied fire for three days, the castaways  face severe dehydration. 17 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? [ theme song playing] Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT  NETWORK TELEVISION  Coming back from Tribal NETWORK TELEVISION  Coming back from Tribal Council without fire was  devastating. With Tina gone, pouring rain, dying of thirst, them thinking  that we're going to bring fire home. So, we leave a pot of water-- of well water, contaminated  water-- in the pot instead of an open, empty pot to catch rain water is a bad  way to end day three. <br/>I don't think I've ever gone this long without food. <br/>Last night was the most miserable night of my life. I tried to sleep. I didn't get a single wink of sleep all night long. I sat upright in the shelter all night, rocking back and forth,  trying to stay warm, 'cause we were all soaking wet. <br/>Vietnam was the same as this place, you know. You get wet, and...  You stay wet? <br/>...and your boots never dried. <br/>You were in Vietnam? <br/>Yeah, we were down in the Mekong Delta. <br/>You ever scared? <br/>Was I scared? Yeah, for a whole year. [ chuckling]  Rudy is one of a kind. He sleeps on the ground when the rest of us are squeezing  together in our shelter. And he was drinking well water before we could boil safely, even  after we'd been told specifically that there are some crazy parasites in  there that will put you in a coma. Rudy, are you still drinking that well water? <br/>Oh, yes, he is. <br/>Well, at this point, he's drank so much. [ laughing]  It doesn't taste like rot? <br/>I'm still standing at noon, don't drink it. [ chuckling]  Water contamination will hit you pretty quick. But once Rudy decides he wants to drink the well water, there's  no telling him no. He does what he wants. <br/>There used to be a little bar next to where we lived in  Utah. You know, they'd serve ice, which was rare. And I asked them, "Where did you get the water?" They  said the reservoir. At any given time, you could see six bodies floating around in  that reservoir, you know? <br/>Aw...  Did you drink it with ice? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, geez. <br/>And I should worry about this? <br/>Wow. [ chuckles]  Dehydration may be our biggest concern at this point. We haven't been able to achieve fire, thus we have not been able  to boil the water from our water source. <br/>Our tongues had turned white. It was just so hot. We were just dying of thirst. <br/>Initially, the rain came, and you're thinking, "Okay,  I got to keep dry." But after a few minutes of that, the light bulb went  on. And all of us realized that fresh water was falling from the  sky. <br/>I never thought I'd be so happy to see tropical rain. We were like animals gone wild. I mean, we hadto have water. That water was sosweet. <br/>I think if it keeps going like this for a few more  minutes, I'll drink my fill. <br/>Hopefully, it'll rain for quite a while. It's nice and warm. It's just wet, wet, wet, wet, wet. <br/>My take on Richard's choice to be, you know, a nudist out  here... honestly it doesn't bother me in the least. Every time he drops trou, and comes just stumbling back into  camp without a stitch of clothing on, it was hilarious. <br/>It's nice out there. It's not cold. My thing is, sitting under there trying to avoid drops, it gets  cold. <br/>The bad part is, the rest of us are becoming comfortable  with it. That's what's even spooky. We got an overweight, gay, naked man walking around, and no one  seems to let it bother them. I don't know. Unfortunately, I think he wants us all to be naked and natural  walking around. That I don't see happening. <br/>We got some water  We got some water We got some water. <br/>Whoo! <br/>You would have thought that maybe we were drinking  champagne, but it was just getting water from the rain. <br/>Nobody knows The words But it's all good today And I know  We're going to drink Some water I want to know Have you ever seen the rain? Coming down Over me... [ laughing] [ cheering] [ chanting]  Uh-oh. <br/>"Don't open. Very valuable. Keep dry."  We see a big crate, and there's three padlocks on the  crate. So, we have no idea what's inside. <br/>It looks like we're playing for a set of keys, yeah? <br/>I don't know. It feels like something substantial, whatever it is. <br/>Maybe it's an animal. It's always interesting when they give you boxes. You know, you go through all the options of what you'd want to  be in there...  Food. <br/>Matches or something. <br/>Anything, at this point, that you get to open is fun,  'cause it's like a gift. <br/>They brought this so we could stare at it and wonder  what's in it for the next two hours. <br/>This is, like, such a tease. <br/>Hold on, hold on...  Oh, yeah, I tried...  Hold on. I just had an idea. You guys want to open it? When we first got that box, my first inclination was,  "Forget about the note. We're starving over here." We just smash it open. <br/>No, I don't want to ruin our chances at anything...  You win the challenge, the challenge...  But then, all of a sudden, everybody else was saying,  "Oh, no, we don't want to do that. We might upset Pretty Boy Probst or something." [  chanting]  Probst: Come on in, guys. Mogo Mogo, Chapera getting their first look at the new Saboga  tribe. Tina voted out, first Tribal Council. Okay, let's get to today's reward challenge. We're building a staircase to the stars. Here's how it works. There are five logs tethered out in the ocean. On my "go," five members of each tribe will swim out  and get the furthest log. Once there, you'll unclip the log, bring it back, put it in the  staircase as the first leg. Then four tribe members, then three, then two, until we get to  the last log. One tribe member will retrieve the final log, place it in the  staircase. First tribe to get all five pieces and get to the top of the platform  wins reward. This isgoing to be grueling, especially for your anchors, 'cause  they're swimming every leg. Now, you want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Please. <br/>Probst: Blankets. Keep you warm at night. <br/>That's nice. <br/>Probst: Come in handy. Chapera, Mogo Mogo, 'cause you have one extra member, you're  sitting somebody out. Keeping in mind, you cannot sit out the same person in  back-to-back challenges. Chapera, who's sitting out? <br/>Big Tom. <br/>Probst: Big Tom. Mogo Mogo, who's sitting out? <br/>Jenna. <br/>Probst: Jenna. Everybody else, wait for my "go." For reward,  survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, guys. <br/>Whoo-ya! Let's go! Come on, Big Red! <br/>Probst: Swimming out to the furthest log first. <br/>Let's suck some seawater! Let's go! <br/>Probst: Chapera first at their log. Unclips, heading back. Saboga heading back. Moga Mogo heading back. We're dead even. Stay with that log, guys. Stay with your log. <br/>Stay with the log. You got it. Let's go! Go right. What are you doing? <br/>Let's go! <br/>Probst: Got to be together. <br/>Come on, Rudy. We need you, buddy. Come on, Rudy. Come on. <br/>Probst: Jenna working with Rudy. <br/>Come on! You just have to get to the beach. <br/>Probst: Mogo Mogo together. Chapera's together. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Probst: Hang in there, Rudy. You're there. Place it once you have it in. <br/>I got to get some air. <br/>Probst: All three tribes are neck and neck. Shii Ann is sitting out for Mogo Mogo. Rudy taking a sit. Alicia taking a sit. Four tribe members now swimming out for the fourth log. Let's go, keep moving! You can rest tonight. Saboga has their second log. Mogo Mogo has their second log. <br/>Let's go, guys! <br/>Probst: Chapera unhooked and heading back! <br/>Let's go, guys! Let's go! <br/>Probst: Saboga first out the water. Mogo Mogo right behind them. Saboga with their second step in the ladder. <br/>[ groans loudly]  Probst: Mogo Mogo heading back out. Here comes Chapera. <br/>Let's go, guys! <br/>Probst: Jenna sitting out. Kathy sitting out. Rob, Amber, Sue, going back. Swimming really taking its toll. <br/>They're slowing down. Hell! The turtle wins the race! <br/>Probst: Saboga has their third log, heading back. Mogo Mogo has their third log, heading back. Sue, Rob and Amber still struggling. <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>Come on, guys, please! <br/>Probst: Once again, Saboga first out of the water. <br/>Probst: Can't put it in till everybody's there. <br/>You're so close! <br/>Probst: Let's go, Mogo Mogo. You're still in this. <br/>Come on, you can do it. <br/>Probst: Rupert and Ethan heading back out. <br/>Come on, you guys! <br/>Probst: Lex and Richard heading back out for Mogo Mogo  while Chapera comes in with their third log. Boston Rob and Sue heading back out. Can they close the gap? Saboga with the big lead. <br/>Come on, you guys! <br/>Probst: Rupert looking strong as ever. Ethan right there with him. <br/>Come on! Hurry up! <br/>Come on, let's go! <br/>Guys, come on! <br/>Probst: Saboga again first out of the water. Mogo Mogo on their tail. <br/>Let's go! <br/>Catch up! Let's go, Mogo Mogo. You're still in this. Ethan taking the last leg for Saboga. <br/>Go! Go! Go! <br/>Probst: Hatch has a lot of ground to make up on Ethan. Can he do it? Mariano taking the last leg for Chapera. <br/>You're catching up! Let's go! <br/>This is everything, Ethan. Come on. <br/>Come on, Ethan! <br/>Ethan, we love you! <br/>Probst: A lot of swimming with no food and no water in  your belly. Boston Rob having a tough time. <br/>Go... Ethan. <br/>Probst: Ethan close to winning it for Saboga. Hatch still a lot of ground to make up. Ethan with the final log for Saboga. Got to get to the top. <br/>Go, Ethan, go! <br/>Probst: Saboga wins reward. <br/>You did it. And we showed them. <br/>Get in here, Rudy. <br/>Probst: All right. Saboga, congratulations. And your reward, blankets. <br/>Yay. <br/>Probst: Before you take the blankets, I want to make a proposition  to you. Each tribe today received a lock box. I'm going to tell you what's in the lock box: Rice. <br/>ALL: Oh! <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Probst: Only problem is, that lock box and the rice in it  does you no good, because you need three keys to get it open, and even if you  had it open without fire, you can't cook the rice. So, here's the offer. You can trade the blankets for this-- the first clue to finding  the first key to get in your lock box. Flint. You'll have a constant source of fire, and a pot to cook that  rice in. There's a rub. If you take... the pot with the clue and the map and the flint  instead of the blankets, Mogo Mogo gets it, as well as Chapera. <br/>Oh. [ all talking]  Is that good with you? <br/>What are you going to do? <br/>I say we still take it, give everybody. <br/>Give everybody...  Oh! <br/>Yes! <br/>Oh, yeah! <br/>Thank you. [ cheering]  Probst: Here you go. I'm throwing it up. [ cheering]  Toss it up here, Jeffy. <br/>I can't believe they  Toss it up here, Jeffy. <br/>I can't believe they ousted Tina. <br/>Holy...  Oh, my God, that is... That is such a shock. <br/>I would have put a lot of money that Rudy was gone. Holy crap. That thing kind of blew me out of the water. Tina, first one out. Big targets on the winners, except me. No. It was a big target on me. Ha! We'll see. <br/>Me, I'm surprised, but at the same time, it's cool,  because it sets the tone for the whole game. <br/>There's no...  Tina's first out. We all know what... It's business this time. <br/>It was tough. That was probably the toughest challenge I've ever  experienced...  That might be the hardest challenge I've done on Survivor. <br/>...in any Survivor. <br/>When we showed up to the challenge, and I saw Tina was  voted out of the game, that made me very excited, because I think that she's  a big phony. And if it means that the winners are going next, that's all  right by me. But the last time I checked, I didn't have a million dollars  yet. <br/>You want to get some fire going? <br/>Let's try to get the fire. Let's go, Tommy, first try. There it is, there it is, there it is. <br/>Yeah, there's a coating on the flint, and you got to get  all the coating off, and then you can strike it. <br/>Big Tom knows what he's doing. <br/>I came back here, and I knew exactly how to build a fire  and get it started, but of course, Boston Rob and Big Tom-- these guys are so  macho. They're the men. They're the men of the tribe. <br/>Tommy, you're getting sparks already. <br/>Can we build a nest right on it and-and light it from  here, as opposed to that little...? <br/>Yeah, let's try to do it. <br/>Because...  Well, uh, really that's great, but, uh...  Can I try it? <br/>Yeah, try it. <br/>Right now, old farm boy's just got to keep his mouth shut. It's too early in the game to be bossy. I think we got four or five bosses and maybe one Indian. <br/>Make sure it's fluffy. <br/>Want me to scrape a little bit of the magnesium on there? <br/>Yeah, you want air. <br/>Yeah, go ahead, scrape a little magnesium on it. <br/>Lots of air. <br/>Awesome. That's good. That's all you have to do. <br/>Alicia's just talking a little bit too much. <br/>Don't-don't move away from the fire. <br/>She walks around giving orders constantly. It's her nature. She got a big mouth. She needs to learn to shut it. <br/>You got it. There you go, you got it. That's it. That's all we needed. Beautiful. <br/>Yee-ha! <br/>That was...  We got it. We got it going on. <br/>There you go. <br/>Sweet. <br/>There'll be no more rubbing of sticks together. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh! [ grunts]  That was flame. Oh, my God. In the first two min... Oh, my God, I'm getting excited. <br/>Our lives are about to change for the better. <br/>It's still going to be very hard. This is showing me that I'm not... You know, I thought I was an  outdoors man, and I am, with a lighter. [ laughs]  Hello, water. I don't know. You're much stronger than I am. <br/>You don't think I'm the biggest...? After my display today, you don't think I'm the biggest target  that's out there right now? <br/>Yeah. I felt really bad for Ethan, because he knows he's on the  chopping block. And then, it was even worse at the reward challenge when he did  so well. And I went to congratulate him like I did everyone else, and I  was, like, "Great job." And he's, like, "Yeah." 'Cause he  knows it's all for naught. We don't know when we're going to lose immunity. We might not lose. It might be nine days. Who knows? Just give it a couple of days rest, okay? <br/>I already had a talk with Jenna Lewis. She says, "Well, you know, maybe we'll keep you around a  little longer, you know, if that's what you wanted." Oh, thanks, Jenna. You know, thanks for granting me that one wish. It's like she's, like, so cocky, calling the shots and stuff,  and it just bugs me. <br/>Whoa! <br/>Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah...  Wait. Don't blow too hard, you're just gonna blow it out. <br/>There's a fire. There's a fire going. <br/>Sticks, more sticks. <br/>There you are. There you go. <br/>Some more, some more. More sticks. <br/>I'll blow it from this side. <br/>We got plenty of sticks. Whoo! <br/>Jesus! Aah, aah. Damn it. I'm all right. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Stupid me puts my face two inches from the fire. Whap! It singed all of the hair off the front of my head, but we have  fire. It's like the power of the gods. <br/>I see that. <br/>Yay! <br/>Yay! <br/>We got fire! Yay! <br/>It's joy. <br/>It's wet. Here comes the rain. <br/>It starts pouring, we may need to postpone this. We made a huge effort to try to make fire. I don't know what the deal is. I don't know if it's... if, at this point, it's a function of  our materials or our level of energy that there are too many conditions that  are working against us, because the humidity's so high. <br/>Oh! <br/>Let me blow from the bottom. <br/>It's going to pour any second. <br/>No, it's not. <br/>Look at that. <br/>Should we maybe consider not making fire until the storm  passes? <br/>Until tomorrow morning. <br/>Yeah. <br/>No. Why not keep trying? <br/>I don't want to waste material...  I mean, we have an opportunity to make fire. Why not? [ thunder rumbling] [ rain pouring]  Why is it so cold? <br/>I hate the fact we don't have fire. <br/>Oh. We should have done the fire right when we got back. <br/>I know. <br/>We're freezing because our lame boys didn't make the fire. Lex now regrets how he didn't get on it, so I'm just trying to  warm up, 'cause we're all soaking wet. I'm having a great time. [ birds squawking]  We need more fuel, sticks. We finally got fire, and, uh, I mean, fire is everything. It's food, it's water. You know, it gives you a purpose. Oh, my God, we've got fire. <br/>"...past the forest where roots sprout from the  ground, the outermost point is where it can be found. Carved in the side of the hill is a cave. Tucked deep inside is the key that you crave."  I think it's that way. <br/>We decided to go look for the key for one of the three  locks on the treasure chest of what I guess now we found out is rice. [ squawking]  No? <br/>No, not that I can find. <br/>What? <br/>We found it. <br/>You did? <br/>Put it back. I wanted to see where it is. <br/>Cool box. <br/>Here we go. <br/>Let's see, let's see, let's see. <br/>Found it, no problem. It was deep within the cave. Anybody looking would think of today as huge, given that we got  water and fire and a key to the trunk. That's all extraneous crap to me. That's not Survivor. The game's all the interpersonal stuff. Yeah, you roar. We got it, whoa! [ blows raspberry] You know, that's outside the game. That just isn't in me. <br/>Is he still limping? <br/>He's kind of stumbling, even just walking over those  rocks. <br/>Yeah, I know. <br/>But he's walking. He's getting around. He's... you know... a tough old man. <br/>My foot hurts when I walk. You know, it, uh... it sort of makes me limp a little. I don't know what's wrong. It... probably in a week, it'll be back to normal. <br/>How's it doing today? Any better? No? <br/>Not much. <br/>Why don't you sit down, take it easy? <br/>I wanted to see if I could run. I can't. <br/>Rudy's not doing okay. His feet... he's got a big blister, but also he did something to  the bone inside that's been really hurting. And he tells me he can't walk, he can't run. <br/>I sure hope it's not a running challenge today, 'cause  we'll be dead alive. <br/>Probst: First things first. 'cause we'll be dead alive. <br/>Probst: First things first. Thank you, Amber. Shii Ann. Shared immunity for two tribes back up for grabs. Ready for today's challenge? Each tribe will start out an a floating platform. On my "go," all five tribe members will dive out, get  to the bottom of the ocean floor, where you will find a sunken boat loaded  with 14 very heavy crates. Untying a series of slipknots, you'll release the crates. Then you have to get the crates out of your boat. Once all 14 crates are out, the boat will float to the top. You'll drag it back to your platform, flip it over and start  bailing out the water. You get your paddles. It is a race back to shore. The first two tribes to cross the finish line with all members  and their boat wins immunity. Chapera, Mogo Mogo, because you have extra members, you're  sitting somebody out. For Chapera, who's sitting out this one? Alicia. Mogo Mogo? All right, Shii Ann. Everybody else, swim out. Here we go, guys. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! Everybody got to get a hand on the pontoon. Start diving! <br/>We got them all. <br/>Okay. <br/>I got two boxes off. <br/>Probst: Take your time. 2,000 pounds of weight in that boat. [ indistinct voices]  Oh! [ splutters]  I got one. [ coughs]  Probst: Jenna heads back for [ coughs]  Probst: Jenna heads back for Saboga to the platform. <br/>Go, Rupert. It's right there. <br/>Probst: Saboga, the first tribe with their boat up,  dragging their boat back to the platform. Saboga at the platform. platform. Saboga at the platform. <br/>Right there. Let it up, let it up. <br/>Probst: Chapera with their boat up. Mogo Mogo has their boat up. <br/>Come on! <br/>Push! <br/>Probst: Chapera catching up. Saboga already bailing. [ indistinct voices]  Pick it up, pick it up! Just bail, just bail. <br/>Probst: Saboga bailing water. Chapera starting to flip their boat. Mogo Mogo almost back to the platform. Saboga still bailing water. Chapera trying to flip their boat. Chapera, Mogo Mogo trying to get their boat flipped. [ indistinct voices] Chapera flipping their boat. Chapera's boat is empty. Mogo Mogo working on flipping that boat. Saboga still bailing water. <br/>Get out of the boat! [ shouting]  Probst: Mogo Mogo's flipped their boat. Chapera takes the lead. [ shouting] Mogo Mogo trying to bail water. Saboga trying to bail water. Saboga lost a bailing bucket. <br/>Okay, we got it. Saboga lost a bailing bucket. <br/>Okay, we got it. One, two...  Probst: Mogo Mogo paddling while they bail. A risky strategy. Saboga was the first tribe back to the platform. They are still at the platform. Saboga forgets a paddle, another mistake. <br/>Rudy, get in the boat! <br/>Rupert! <br/>It's sinking! Bail! <br/>Probst: Hatch takes a dump. <br/>Bail in the back, bail in the back! <br/>CHAPERA: One, two, row! <br/>Damn it. <br/>Team, let's go! <br/>Damn it. <br/>Team, let's go! Rudy, get your butt up here! Where is he? Where is he? <br/>Probst: Chapera with a big lead. <br/>CHAPERA: One, two. [ grunting]  Probst: Mogo Mogo sinking deeper. Saboga, you still have a shot. The first two tribes win immunity. <br/>Everybody out. Everybody out. Everybody out. <br/>Probst: Chapera first to the beach. <br/>Come on, we can do it. [ cheering]  Say it, Jeff, say it! "Chapera."  Whoo! <br/>Drop that puppy! <br/>Probst: Chapera, first to cross, wins immunity. [ cheering] It is a race for second place. <br/>Come on, Mogo Mogo. We're still in the hunt. [ yelling]  Probst: Mogo Mogo wins immunity. <br/>Yeah, baby! Whoo! <br/>Probst: For the second straight time, Saboga going to  Tribal Council. Chapera, congratulations. Tribal Council. Chapera, congratulations. Immunity...  Whoo! <br/>Probst: ...once again. Safe from Tribal Council, three more days out in Panama. <br/>Put it up, let's go! Whoo! <br/>Probst: Mogo Mogo, who wants it? Safe from Tribal Council three more days out in Panama. What's to say, Saboga? Great effort, another tough challenge, another visit to Tribal  Council. Another tribe member going home. I'll see you there. You guys can head back to camp. <br/>We had it. <br/>We played stronger, we just didn't play smarter. <br/>I was so frantic. I wanted to get going already. <br/>I know. Then once you and Jerri climbed in, it was sunk again. And we had to lift it back up. It was just a stupid mistake. <br/>One stupid mistake. <br/>Today's immunity challenge was a hugeletdown, and each one  of us is blaming ourselves for some part of what happened. <br/>Ethan gets way too excited at challenges. This time, even though he helped so much at the beginning, he  hurt us at the end of the challenge, and he knew it. Are you going to see if you can catch fish? <br/>Well, tonight we got to go to Tribal Council. And based on last Tribal Council, you know, I'm going to go  tonight. And it's scary, you know. I'm in limbo. I'm hanging on by a thread right now. I got to make sure people want me here, so why not try to start  spear fishing? However, if they or we expect to win any more challenges, you  know, Rudy has to go home. <br/>Rudy came to me. <br/>Rudy what? <br/>Listen to me. Then we all have to vote for him. Are you okay with that? [ sighs] I hear you. <br/>Rudy is most definitely a hero... more so than any other  person here. He deserves to be here. 75 years old and doing [ blip] I can't? [ voice breaking]: It's killing meto be here. Rudy came to me on the first day saying, "I need a  buddy."  I know what you're saying. I adore him. But we're losing bad. <br/>Even though, right now, discussion is about voting off  Rudy 'cause he's our weakest link, he's tough as nails. He never once complained about anything out here, not once. <br/>I don't want to write anybody's name down. I'd write my own [ blip] name down. <br/>Do you want to vote for Ethan? <br/>I'm not writing Rudy's name down. I know that. I'm not writing Rudy's name down. <br/>Bounces off. <br/>Bounces off of them? Probably a good-sized fish, too. <br/>Yeah, they're, like, that big. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Ethan was out there by the rocks trying his new spear, and  he came up empty-handed. I think Ethan was trying to make himself more of an asset to the  team, and if he could get fish as well as Rupert, it would be harder to vote  him off. And then Rupert walks out into the water, and it's amazing. A fish?! <br/>We got our first one. <br/>Well done. <br/>We're having fish tonight. <br/>Damn straight. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>He's little, but he's got some meat. Oh-ho...! <br/>Wow! <br/>Now, Rupert goes out. Five minutes later, he comes back with a fish. Great. <br/>Come here, Ethan. Dig in there. <br/>Wow, that's yummy. <br/>That ain't a bad fish, you know? <br/>Love trigger. He's a great fish. <br/>You know, I'm struggling out here. I'm trying to find my niche, and it's not working. <br/>Probst: So, Rupert, how has it's not working. <br/>Probst: So, Rupert, how has fire improved life at camp? <br/>Last time we were here, we were... sad, we were whipped. Three days with no food and water. Day four came, we won the challenge, we gave everybody fire. We were the victors. Whew! It was a great day. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about today's challenge. From where I was watching, I was trying to figure out who was  going to come in second, because Saboga clearly had it won. And then, Ethan, what happened? <br/>Well, we made a silly mistake. Instead of pulling the boat up entirely out of the water and  dumping it, we tried to bail it while it was still full. <br/>Probst: Jerri, did today's loss set you guys back in terms  of, now you're going to be down to four after tonight? <br/>Absolutely. It's our second time in a row here, and that always sucks. It just sucks coming here, period. <br/>Probst: How about you, Rudy? What is it about this game that continues to appeal to you? You've survived situations much worse than this. <br/>I really don't know why I'm here again. [ chuckles] I'm three years slower, that's for sure. But I like it. You know, putting up with the people is the survival part, not  putting up with the elements. <br/>Probst: How are you hanging in there physically? <br/>Good. I got a sore ankle, but I think it's going away. <br/>Probst: Rupert, new guy on the block, but obviously, you  could be odd man out. <br/>Oh, yes. I'm always going to feel that odd man out. Um, my one saving grace right now, I caught a fish. I caught a fish. [ laughter] I poked it with a stick. I caught a fish. <br/>Probst: Rupert starts catching fish, he becomes much more  valuable. Ethan? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Did you have any reaction when Rupert came in with  the fish? <br/>I was psyched that I was going to eat. [ laughter] I mean, yeah, I didn't catch a fish first, but it  doesn't mean I'm not going to catch ten tomorrow. <br/>Probst: Ethan, it appeared last time that Tina was voted  out, if for no other reason than she's won this game before, and nobody  wanted her to win again. The only other guy on this block tonight that's won this game is  you. So how are you feeling? <br/>I feel nervous. Tribal Council's a scary place. My insides are upside down, flipping around, just like that fish  we caught today. I have a target on my back, and it's out there in the open. <br/>Probst: So how do you vote tonight? Jenna, is there a chance that it's still a money issue? <br/>Yeah, there's still a chance. People are voted out of this game all the time for being too  strong, too alpha male, too much of a provider. What's the difference? Those people don't deserve to go. They're providing for their tribes, but people see them as  competition. The winners have already won. That's a strong competition. So it's just like any other way to vote, if you see it that way. <br/>Probst: Okay, it's time to vote. Jerri, you're up. <br/>Rudy, it was an honor to be on your team, but this is  purely strategical. <br/>Ethan, you're tough. purely strategical. <br/>Ethan, you're tough. Rudy and I made a pact, and I am not voting for Rudy. I got to vote for you, Ethan. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Rudy. Ethan. One vote Ethan, one vote Rudy. Ethan. Two votes Ethan, one vote Rudy. Rudy. Two votes Rudy, two votes Ethan. I'll read the last vote. Second person voted out of the Saboga Tribe... Rudy. You need to bring me your torch. Rudy, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Well, Tribal Council is an interesting place, always emotional. Tonight was no exception. How could you not like Rudy? 75-year-old former Navy SEAL, hanging with kids a third of his  age: a hero in anybody's book. I know you didn't want to vote him out, and yet somebody had to  go, which is exactly what makes Survivorwhat it is: complicated. Grab your torches, head on back to camp. Good night.

Rupert and Jerri go  head-to-head. <br/>I know what I did, 'cause I've done my ... for years. <br/>Rupert's a complete control freak. Let's just ... do it. <br/>Jerri and Rupert got in a fight. Perfect. That's just what I wanted. <br/>Probst: While Richard faces off with a shark. <br/>Screw it-- I'm not leaving the thing there, I'm going home  with food. <br/>I talked to these people about two hours ago, and  everything was all set up to vote Ethan off. And, uh, I can see Ethan voting against me, but I can't see the  other two people voting against me, and if I was them, I'd stay clear of me. I got a lot of friends. That's about all I got to say.
