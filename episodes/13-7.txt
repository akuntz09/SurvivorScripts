<br/>[ theme music playing]  Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK  TELEVISION TELEVISION  JEFF Probst: Tonight, on a special edition of Survivor: Cook Island...  We play for our team. <br/>Right. <br/>And when we're in the merge together, we keep an eye out for each other, and  that's going to be the difference between our culture verses others. <br/>Probst: You'll see 14 scenes of all-new footage. <br/>Let's get this party started. Keep it going, dog. <br/>Throw it. <br/>Stefannie had about three swigs, and she's delirious. <br/>Oh, yeah, hold her up. <br/>Oh, yeah, hold her up. [ laughter] [ laughter]  I mean, we're getting blown away from our island. <br/>I know. I don't know what to do about it. <br/>What is that? <br/>I hope that's not them flipped over. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Probst: You'll see highlights from the first 18 days of this adventure. <br/>Ah! <br/>No! <br/>Ah, stop! I am so sorry. <br/>I came here to play the game. That's my dream. My prize isn't even the million dollars. My prize was I fell in love in this game, love at first sight. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>What? <br/>The little chick. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>This thing is newborn, like today. <br/>Wow. I am really sorry. I mean it. <br/>Probst: And we'll delve deeper into Survivor'smost controversial season ever. <br/>This was a racially based set of tribes. I think it'll be interesting to see if there really is cultural bias. You know, the Asian tribe, they're not all from one country, per se, I'm  assuming. And I'm a white guy, but I'm a white Jew. <br/>You represent your race. It's not about avoiding. It's always a wall. We can never let that wall down to interact or be honest with others. <br/>It's a little bit uncomfortable for me. It's like you're trying to change the world in 39 days, and that just made  the game that that just made the game that much harder. much harder. <br/>Watch it, watch it, watch it! <br/>Probst: 18 days ago, 20 Americans began the adventure of a lifetime. They had just two minutes to gather everything they would gather everything  they would need for the next 39 days. need for the next 39 days. 30 seconds! <br/>The chicken! <br/>Forget about the chicken! Let's go! <br/>Get overboard! <br/>Paddle. <br/>Where's the Hawaiian sling? <br/>The teams were actually devised by ethnicity. You had a Latino team. You had an Asian team. You had a Caucasian team. And then you had an African[1]American  team. So I was like, "Oh, snap, you know, I'm not the only token brother for  once."  Ah! <br/>I personally feel like the division is kind of strange. Like, I've never been separated because of my skin color before, and I don't  really like it. <br/>Row, row! <br/>The Asian invasion! <br/>I'm pretty, you know, as Americanized as you can get. At the same time, I mean, growing up, there were times when people would make  presumptions about me or make fun of me or insult me because of my ethnicity. I remember when I was a kid, every time we put up Christmas lights, young  kids would come by lights, young kids would come by and smash our Christmas  lights. and smash our Christmas lights. <br/>To me, being a Dominican American is just a conversation piece. Because, like, being a Dominican, what is that going to do for me out here? I think that means squat. I think the content of your character means everything. Building stuff, there should be the shelter, plus I know how to make a toilet. <br/>You want the machete? <br/>Well, no. First I'll just explain it to you, and then we'll all be, like, on the same  page. We'll all have the blueprint. <br/>Do you want them with us? <br/>They're going to do the leaves and stuff. They don't really need to hear all this part. <br/>Probst: At Aitu, Billy quickly found himself on the outs...  It was kind of obvious to me that he didn't really know exactly what he was  doing. <br/>Probst: ...forcing Ozzy to step up. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>I mean, he may not be very big, but he's an athlete, and he's somebody who'd  be pretty good at this game. <br/>Really good job. <br/>Good job. <br/>Probst: On Puka...  You've got a touch of bad wind. <br/>Probst: ...Cao Boi resorted to some traditional healing. <br/>There, you'll feel better now. <br/>It looks like it's burned. Does it hurt? <br/>I've never been accepted by the Asian community. I just don't fit the stereotype. It's a very dangerous position for me to be in. <br/>You all know what this is, right? Represent, represent, represent! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: At Hiki, Sekou quickly emerged as a natural leader. <br/>Okay, everybody, focus, okay? Focus on what we're doing. <br/>Is it smoking? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Come on, oh, yes! <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: And then almost as quickly...  I need a break. <br/>Probst: ...burned out. <br/>Want to do it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's all for you. <br/>Hey, y'all, look, a boat! Look! <br/>What? <br/>Yeah, we upgraded! <br/>Probst: But as this never[1]before-seen  footage shows, it wasn't just Sekou who lacked outdoor skills at Hiki. outdoor skills at Hiki. <br/>Be careful. <br/>Be careful. <br/>Look at all the water in our boat. <br/>You know, we thought we were all canoe tight, like, "Yeah, we're going  to row this thing out." That was easier said than done. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, no! <br/>I'm trying to hold it! <br/>We're a bunch of city kids. It's not that we are black, white, Asian, Latino. It's not that. We're city kids. We have one person who's from the South. <br/>Oh, no! Oh, you okay? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's harder than it looks. <br/>You know paddling isn't our specialty. <br/>No, the whole boat experience, rafts, boats, experience, rafts, boats,  anything on water that... anything on water that...  I don't know everything, but I never got on a boat that did that. that. <br/>I have no clue. <br/>I have no clue. <br/>So are you getting in the front? <br/>It really doesn't matter to me. I'll do it either way. <br/>I'll be in the driver's seat. <br/>We're about to go out, Candice and I, catch us some food. Ready? I'm dying for some protein, so hopefully we can catch some fish and get that. Hopefully by the end of the day Hopefully by the end of the day we'll have  all that for us. we'll have all that for us. <br/>Probst: Day two at Raro found Adam and Candice eager for an Adam and Candice  eager for an adventure. adventure. <br/>Probst: But when the weather turned, the adventure went south. <br/>I mean, we're getting pulled away from our island. <br/>I know. I don't know what to do about I don't know what to do about it. it. Found a little sandbar here to hang out at, because every time we try to  start paddling, the current's so strong, it actually current's so strong, it  actually brings us straight back. brings us straight back. Cold? <br/>Yeah. <br/>We'd been out there for hours. We were exhausted. It was awful. I mean, we were shivering. My knees were shaking. My jaw was shivering. We were wet, and it's just the frustration wearing on you. It's the worst situation I've been in in a long, long time. I want to do something. I don't want to sit...  Yeah, I don't think we can paddle it. I really don't. <br/>You know, we're just going to have to sacrifice the boat. <br/>What is that? <br/>I hope that's not them flipped over. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>I don't even see a boat. <br/>You know, with the wind and the current, I mean, we were shivering, and we  were freezing, and we were exhausted. It was awful. But we finally made it back. <br/>Can you see the little speck out there? <br/>That's our boat? <br/>Yeah, I think so. <br/>Did it flip over? <br/>No. <br/>Wait, it's not flipped over or anything? <br/>No, no. It's anchored to the sandbar. <br/>You couldn't paddle it? You guys were too tired? I was concerned about Candice and Adam, when they came back without the boat,  and they're, like, shivering and purple. And then after I got over my initial concern, I'm concerned about the boat. We need that to go fishing. Like, we need food. <br/>I just can't stand giving up, you know? you know? <br/>Yeah, I know. <br/>Yeah, I know. <br/>Save the other leaves for when we make the tent for tomorrow. <br/>Why do you say we need more cross bars? <br/>Because when you look underneath, they're starting to bow. We probably just need one more. <br/>Oh, okay, that's fine. <br/>All right. <br/>There's a couple here. <br/>Probst: While the Aitu tribe worked on their shelter, Billy, in this new  footage, went to in this new footage, went to work on Aitu. work on Aitu. <br/>Well, strategically, first I went up to J.P., and I set up an alliance with  him right away. Me and him to the end, that was the first thing I said. And he didn't want to hear why. And he didn't want to hear why. He was just happy with it. He was just happy with it. But we don't want to get caught, like, a surprise challenge, then we lose,  and then right away we go to tribal, and then we don't know what we're doing. The next thing I did was I went up to Christa and Cecilia, and I put the idea  in her head. It's like you want to hope for the best, but you got to prepare for the worst. If you two are going to get together, then I want to be with you two. <br/>Right. <br/>You know, it's out there so we don't get caught. We can just like... you know, whatever, give a sign. <br/>Okay. <br/>And then we know. I was trying to play both sides of the fence, because this game shifts so  much that if you rely on just one alliance or one person to get you to the  end, you're not going to make it. <br/>Probst: Hiki has their torch! They're coming back! At the first immunity challenge on day three... Puka wins the challenge! ...Puka, Aitu, and Raro won immunity and flint to make fire. Hiki was not so lucky. No fire for you, somebody going home. But a surprise was revealed. The losing tribe will choose one person from any of the other tribes to go to  Exile Island. And the two men of Hiki chose Jonathan. On Exile Island, Jonathan searched for the hidden immunity idol. <br/>The idol! I'm cold, miserable, shivering. I'm cold, miserable, shivering. Exile Island's really terrible. Exile Island's really terrible. <br/>Probst: Back at the Hiki camp, as this new footage reveals, the tribe  considered the consequences of losing the first challenge. <br/>I think today we learned a lot about working as a team. <br/>Rather than us trying to do 50 things? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I don't like being on a losing team. I don't like it. But you know, we're sticking together. We're keeping our spirits up. <br/>You know, it's only natural  You know, it's only natural that we're all just like... that we're all just  like... I mean, I might not even say it, but I think it. <br/>Of course. <br/>And it's just...  If you have any ounce of awareness, you know, I think you do. <br/>I knew that I gave it my all and that should be enough. But now, because it's been divided by race, it's not enough. And that's how the group pretty much feels, because we do, on some level,  feel like we're representing a race. If whatever we... if we lose a challenge or we don't succeed in something, it  has nothing to do with the color of our skin. <br/>No! <br/>Nothing. We're just all people trying to succeed in a game. Now it was just figuring out who was the weak link within our tribe, which,  again, doesn't have anything to do with the color of a person's skin, just  personality, who clashes. <br/>Probst: At the first tribal council... First person voted out of Survivor:  Cook Islands... ...the women of Hiki decided that Sekou was their weak link. Sekou, the tribe has spoken. <br/>I knew my head was on the chopping block. Nathan kept warning me all along that the sisters would stick together. I don't know, maybe they felt I was taking a leadership role and they needed  to get me out. There were some things that I'm not knowledgeable about, but I was willing to  come out here and learn. I take a lot of pride in that. You know, that's what made it You know, that's what made it such an adventure  for me. such an adventure for me. <br/>Let me just say straight out, like, I trust you. <br/>No, that's what... you were from the very beginning, yeah. <br/>Probst: On day three, Yul and Becky formed an alliance at Puka. <br/>Sticking together, obviously, would help us in the game. <br/>I want to stay together. I agree. Yul and I are both Asian, both Korean, that we're automatically going to form  alliances because of that. In Korean, you call an older brother an opa,and he seems sort of like an  older brother to me, and I trust him a lot. <br/>Oh, this is good eating. These are some kind of nuts. I don't know what they call them. <br/>Probst: Later, Cao Boi and Yul searched for food and common ground. <br/>You mentioned the other day that people assume that you're Japanese. Why? <br/>I look... I look Japanese. I go to Vietnam, they all try to speak Japanese to me. But then I tell them, "No, why don't you look at a history book? This is your ancestor's face." "No!" "All of you look  Chinese to me." They don't like that, but they do. <br/>A lot of people can't differentiate among Asian Americans. I mean, "Asian American" is a very broad term that encompasses a  broad range of communities, and we're not all alike. <br/>Each one of us is an ambassador of our own race, right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>We play for our team. <br/>Right. <br/>And when we're in the merge together, we keep an eye out for each other. That's going to be the difference between our culture versus others. <br/>All right. <br/>I'll see you, brother. Good job. Thank you. <br/>Probst: At Aitu, Billy wasn't pulling his weight. <br/>We lose Billy, we come back stronger than ever. <br/>Probst: So Ozzy suggested a bold plan to throw the challenge and oust Billy. <br/>Billy is just dead weight, so we might as well cut our losses now and get on  with the game. <br/>Probst: J.P. was on board, but Christina was skeptical. <br/>I'm thinking, "You know, this doesn't seem right." I don't know if  I can trust Oscar anymore. <br/>Probst: But at the challenge... Puka's on the course. Raro's on the course. Hiki's on the course. ...Ozzy's plan went into action. Aitu completely unconcerned about this challenge. Puka, Raro, Hiki all safe from tribal council. Aitu came in dead last and chose Yul from the Puka tribe to go to Exile  Island. Yul, boat's waiting for you now. Before the tribes parted, Billy thought he and Candice made a thought he and  Candice made a connection. connection. <br/>Probst: At Aitu's tribal council on night six, J.P. confronted Billy about his work ethic. <br/>I came here to play the game. That's my dream. <br/>Part of the game is trying to involve yourself. That way, people find...  Well, excuse me, I'm still talking here. <br/>That way, people find you as value...  I'm still talking here. You'll get your turn. <br/>That way, people find you as valuable. <br/>I'm still talking here. You'll get your turn, Mr. Bully. <br/>Because obviously you're not valuable. <br/>My prize isn't even the million dollars. My prize was I fell in love in this game, love at first sight. Her name is Candice, and in between... [ laughter]  Probst: Candice from Raro tribe? <br/>Yeah. After the last challenge, we sort of mouthed the words "I love you"  to one another. So that was my prize. My prize was her. <br/>Probst: In the end, Billy's tribe mates cut him lose. tribe mates cut him lose. Billy, the tribe has spoken. Billy, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Wow. I learned so much about myself. First of all, I learned what my priority was. I learned that I'm not motivated by money. I never was. This game definitely favors those that are willing to stoop. That part of the game, I kind of wish I'd have did without and just played,  you know, to have a good time. I'm definitely not the conniving type or whatever. That's not for me. That was definitely the wrong That was definitely the wrong way to go. way to go. <br/>Probst: On day six, Yul made the most of his time on Exile the most of his  time on Exile Island. Island. <br/>Oh, mama. I found the immunity idol, which is probably the single biggest stroke of  luck I could have had. <br/>Probst: and in this never[1]before-seen  footage, Yul destroyed the note and covered up all evidence of him finding  the hidden immunity idol. <br/>I didn't want the box lying around on the island, so I constructed a little  raft made out of coconut husk, and I'm out of coconut husk, and I'm going to  set it adrift. going to set it adrift. <br/>Probst: With the idol gone, everyone else searched in vain. <br/>Okay. "Use the mast and an island to form a letter. Block out the south, and you'll be doing better." Okay. So many places it can be. I'm just going to cover a big, wide swath 20 feet long and three feet down. If I don't find it, well, it's not from want of trying, you know. Boy, I could use a toothbrush Boy, I could use a toothbrush real bad. real bad. <br/>I have a good chance of finding it if I'm digging in the right place, but I  guess anybody has a good chance of finding it if they're digging in the right  place. And it's got to be in between here somewhere. <br/>"If the southern isle vanishes, a salvation you'll find." That  makes me think that I That makes me think that I should head that way. should head that way. <br/>I don't know if the idol is even still here. Right now I'm just kind of digging wherever. <br/>Probst: All right, drop your buffs. On day seven, the four ethnically divided tribes merged into two very diverse  groups. You are the new Aitu tribe. You are the new Raro tribe. Two new tribes, a whole new game. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! [ cheering] [ cheering]  One, two, three, Raro! <br/>You just moved up, girl. [ laughter]  At first it's going to be all smiles and "A pleasure to meet you, and  we're glad you're here." But in the back of your mind, it's a game, and  you're in it to win it for yourself-- and first and foremost, cold, hard cash. [ cheering]  Probst: At the new Aitu tribe, Jonathan and Becky understood this  immediately, and the game was on. <br/>I trust Yul. I trust Candice. <br/>I totally agree. Becky came right to me. She said, "Yul and I would like to get together with you and  Candice." I said, "I believe that I have Flicka." Stay with me  and Candice, and we'll take these other two, and the five of us will go to  the merge. <br/>Probst: And Yul solidified his bond with Becky. <br/>I found the idol. <br/>Oh, I'm so excited! I'm so proud of you. That's so awesome. <br/>Probst: Back at Raro, Parvati saw an opening of her own. <br/>There are so many men on this tribe now. It seems like we got all the, like, really big, buff guys. Your pants are falling off, Nate. I'm absolutely going to flirt with them. with them. It's what I do best. It's what I do best. <br/>I think Parvati feels really safe because the guys love her. She's, you know, a happy-go[1]lucky,  young, adorable girl, and I don't think they want to see her go at all. She's entertainment for them. You know, it's like watching a movie to them, sitting around and letting her  be adorable. <br/>Bombs away. <br/>Okay, mama, you do that one more time, I'm going to come up there... When I  first saw Parvati, I was like, "Damn!"  Boys will be boys, you know? There's nothing else going on on this island. There's no music, no anything. So what else are they going to think about? They're bored, you know? <br/>She likes to put on her buff as a miniskirt. It's great scenery. <br/>So I want to get in tight with all the guys, work on them and manipulate them  and stuff like that. Like, I haven't even begun to work my feminine ways. It's all a game. The dating game, the game of survival, it's all the same. <br/>Give it all you got, go! <br/>Probst: During the immunity challenge... Yul going to try to fight them off  as long as he can. ...Aitu was outmatched by the brawn of the new Raro tribe. Raro wins immunity! Raro sent Candice to Exile Island, saving her from tribal council and jeopardizing  the new council and jeopardizing the new Aitu alliance. Aitu alliance. <br/>Probst: Suddenly, Becky was on the chopping block. on the chopping block. <br/>Jonathan! <br/>Jonathan! <br/>I thought Flicka was with me. So we've got a serious problem here. <br/>We have to let Becky go. She's a princess out here. <br/>She's not, like, weak. She's strong. <br/>Probst: Yul and Jonathan scrambled to save Becky. <br/>If five of us vote for Cecilia and three of you vote for Becky, then all of a  sudden you're on the outside, you know what I mean? <br/>That's so not the point, though. <br/>Well, what is the point? <br/>She is the weaker link. <br/>I'm trying to think ahead of that. <br/>I'm not thinking ahead. I'm not...  But this is a game. This is like a chess game. <br/>Hmm. <br/>Probst: At tribal council, Jonathan and Yul's efforts paid off. Cao Boi and Jessica flipped, saving Becky and sacrificing Cecilia, Ozzy's  original tribe mate. Cecilia, the tribe has spoken. <br/>I didn't sell out for a chance to be on that island another three days. Given that I did try to play the game with some sort of integrity, really, my  word meant a lot, so those people missed out. <br/>Probst: On night eight, the mood at Raro was confident and serene. <br/>How about "Amazing grace"? Everyone knows that, right? <br/>âª Amazing grace how sweet the  sound âª That saved a wretch like me âª I once was lost but now I'm  found âª Was blind but now I see... âª  Yeah! <br/>Thank you. [ applause]  That was tight! <br/>That was beautiful. <br/>You're really good! <br/>That was very good. <br/>That was touching. <br/>That was touching. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Ah, ah, ah! <br/>Probst: On day 11, the kid in Cao Boi got the best of him. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>What? <br/>Aw. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>A little chick. <br/>It fell out? <br/>Wow. I am really sorry. I mean it. <br/>This thing is newborn, like today. I mean, what do you with this? <br/>I cannot put the nest back up. <br/>We can try. <br/>Okay, buddy, I'm going to put it back for you, okay? Curiosity got the best of me, birdie. I'm sorry. That kid in me just keeps wanting to do stupid things. I feel really bad. I'm really humbled. <br/>Forgive us, please. <br/>Forgive us. I'm sorry. I intrude in your house. There, secure, okay? <br/>Nice, good job. <br/>I'm sorry. <br/>Probst: Meanwhile, the men of Raro were content to kick back. <br/>It's like Sunday Night Footballor something or Sunday morning football. <br/>I know. <br/>The guys are starting to, like, rule the roost a little bit. It was kind of annoying. Because they know that we need Because they know that we need them; they're  strong. them; they're strong. <br/>No way. <br/>You think they were? <br/>Even if they all do think, what's that going to do to us? Nothing. These girls, they're going to need manpower, so the four-guy alliance is  definitely relaxed. <br/>Probst: What J.P. Didn't know was that his cocky attitude was becoming a real thorn in the  girls' side. <br/>Parvati, can you hand me the machete? <br/>Where is it? Oh, yeah. J.P. is very demanding. He's like, "Oh, hand he that machete." You know, "Serve  me." That just doesn't fly with me at all. <br/>Probst: While the men of Raro were taking it easy, Ozzy was bringing in the  big haul for Aitu. <br/>He's the fishing star, for sure. Ozzy's a mad fisherman. <br/>This is so great! <br/>I'm happy being the sole provider of this tribe. If they lose me, then they're going to be losing a lot of strength. <br/>I think we should call him Poseidon now or something. <br/>Yes. <br/>Poseidon! <br/>King Neptune. <br/>Probst: And Ozzy raised his Survivorstock even further... Ozzy just made up a  lot of time with the long run! <br/>Go, Ozzy! <br/>Ozzy first to the mast! ...when he and Cao Boi brought home the victory for Aitu. <br/>Here it comes. <br/>Probst: Aitu wins immunity! <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Great job. <br/>Probst: Back at Raro...  Keep our heads up, guys. <br/>Probst: ...Stephannie  Probst: ...Stephannie expressed some self-doubt. expressed some self-doubt. <br/>Probst: ...opening a door for her tribe to make an easy her tribe to make an  easy decision. decision. <br/>Someone doesn't want to be here, I'm not going to keep you here. <br/>Probst: But Rebecca and Jenny concocted a different plan. <br/>Why don't we switch this up and just have all the girls align right now and  get rid of J.P.? <br/>That's what I say. Women should stick together. It's five women, four men. So if we're going to do any type of alliance, it needs to be done right now,  tonight, if any of the women really want to stay in the women really want to  stay in the game. the game. <br/>Probst: But when Artie expressed reluctance, the girls expressed reluctance,  the girls approached Brad. approached Brad. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: And, as seen in this new footage, they approached Nate as well. Nate as well. <br/>Hey, listen. <br/>Hey, listen. <br/>Whoa! No! <br/>Yeah. <br/>No! <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>No! You guys are stupid! That's not smart. We need his strength. <br/>We'll be fine. We're still stronger than the other team. I thought it was Stephannie too, but...  Probst: But J.P. was kept completely in the dark. <br/>And I was just so pissed at myself and wanting us to win so badly and not  feel like I had given it 100%. <br/>Yeah, I hear you. But you know it kills everybody. <br/>I just set myself up to go home. <br/>You're a beautiful, beautiful person. <br/>Thank you. He actually came up very confident that I'm leaving tonight, and I played right  along with him and said, "You know, thanks. I've had a great time. I'll miss you guys." So I basically played my tail off on that one. You know, I hate that it has to be like this, but, you know, you do what you  do, and you go out on top, and you smile, hold your head high. <br/>You've been... your face just makes me... kept me going. Definitely, definitely. And I will think about your face every single day. <br/>Oh! Thank you, baby. I appreciate it. <br/>I think this will be the hardest vote ever any of us will ever have to do. <br/>Probst: J.P. never saw it coming. At tribal council, everyone but Nate pitched in and gave him the boot. Fourth person voted out of the Cook Islands...  Wow. <br/>Probst: J.P., you need to bring me your torch. <br/>Damn, you guys outwitted me big time. <br/>Probst: J.P., the tribe has  Probst: J.P., the tribe has spoken. spoken. <br/>My biggest attribute is my loyalty, and I think my biggest attribute was my  biggest downfall, because I think I trusted people too much, and everyone  that I trusted ended up not working out for me. <br/>Probst: On day 12, Aitu let the reward challenge slip from their fingers. Jessica drops out. Raro wins reward! [ cheering] And Raro took home wine and fishing supplies. <br/>That's what I'm talking about! <br/>Probst: that night, as seen in this new footage, Raro celebrated. <br/>Are we just going to drink out of the bottle? <br/>Yeah. <br/>We're swigging out of the bottle. <br/>I'm down with that. <br/>We won some wine, so we're getting our fade on, which is quite nice. <br/>That's what I'm talking about, dog. <br/>You know, we can all get loose, and I think everyone's real personalities are  going to kind of come out when we get a little booze in us-- especially  Stephannie. She don't ever drink. <br/>Is it good? <br/>It tastes like a buttery Chardonnay. <br/>We're all happy. <br/>No! [ laughter]  Let's get this party started! Keep it going, dog! <br/>She's a lightweight here. <br/>She drunk? <br/>Mama's drunk. <br/>I'm taking care of my mama. I'm taking care of my mama. <br/>Mama needs to lay down. She hasn't eaten anything. <br/>Oh, my god! She's wasted. [ laughter]  Stephannie's, like, on some drugs right now. She is torn back. <br/>Give her another shot! [ laughter]  It's funny, though, because you can tell she's like the good old Southern mom  who doesn't get faded. So, like, a couple of sips, so she's kind of like... she's more than drunk. Home girl's on another level. <br/>You all right? <br/>Hold her up! <br/>Stephannie had about, probably, like, three swigs, and she's delirious. She's just talking nonsense and kind of almost passing out. It's really cute. <br/>Walk this way. <br/>Walk this way. <br/>Good girl! <br/>Good girl! <br/>Okay, we need to get...  What are we doing with it? <br/>We need some coconut juice. We need to open up some coconuts. We need coconut pieces and then a little bit of saltwater. <br/>Probst: On day 13, Christina was getting on Raro's nerves. <br/>Then we got to that pot, take it to the water. <br/>We're all annoyed by Christina. She tells people, "Can you do this? this? Can do you that?" Can do you that?" Christina is coming across as,  like, our new J.P. like, our new J.P. So she better watch herself. So she better watch herself. <br/>Mine are worse, aren't they? Are mine worse? <br/>Yours aren't that bad. <br/>Probst: At Aitu, Ozzy had a difficult time getting Candice, Sundra, and Becky  motivated. <br/>Do any of you guys want to go out in the boat to the reef, go out in the boat  to the reef, go do some relaxing diving? do some relaxing diving? <br/>Yeah. The fish are right out there. <br/>The reason that I hesitate to go is that I get really cold. <br/>Yeah. <br/>If it was sunny, I would be out there all day. I feel like once I get really cold, I'm just, like, sitting there, and I'm no  good for doing anything. <br/>It's starting to get really trying on my patience, and it's getting harder  and harder for me to motivate to want to go out and fish when I know that I  get one-eighth of the fish that I catch, and the rest of it goes to, you  know, some people that aren't as deserving. <br/>Go for it, guys. It'll be a little hot. <br/>Everyone get a crab who wants a crab? <br/>I'll eat the bones when you're done if you're not going to eat them. <br/>Eat the bones? <br/>I'm annoyed that these princesses sit around. They eat the most. They consume the most calories, and they expend the least. They don't appreciate a darn thing. They appreciate when they eat it that it tastes great. But watch out, there's a knife poised at your back at all poised at your back  at all times. times. <br/>Probst: Later, Ozzy, Cao Boi, and Jessica set out to explore the neighboring  island. <br/>I don't want to go back, almost. <br/>Probst: And they made a surprising discovery. <br/>Why is their tribe here? <br/>How you doing? <br/>Probst: And Raro was not  Probst: And Raro was not pleased. pleased. <br/>How are you, my man? <br/>Hi, Cao Boi. <br/>Parvati. <br/>You're Parv...  Parvati. <br/>Par...  Par-va-ti. <br/>Par-va-ti. <br/>I didn't like it at all. I don't think they should be on our island. This is our turf. This is our territory. This is our territory. They got their own island. They got their own island. <br/>Probst: On day 14, Aitu won the immunity challenge. Aitu wins immunity! <br/>Damn! <br/>Probst: And Raro was united  Probst: And Raro was united on who should go next. on who should go next. <br/>Okay. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>Probst: But Stephannie's talk of home...  I can easily see myself going home and getting some mashed potatoes and gravy. <br/>Probst: ...made the tribe question their decision. <br/>She's already mentally checked out. <br/>Probst: At tribal council, Christina realized she was on shaky ground. <br/>Just her personality. You know, it can be a little nerve-racking sometimes. <br/>Probst: Fifth person voted out of the Cook Islands... But it was Stephannie  who was sent back to the home she missed so much. Stephannie, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Actually, I'm extremely proud that I made it for 14 days. Sure, I would have loved to have stayed in the game a lot longer. You know, anybody would be. I think what took me out of the game was the emotional aspect of missing my  family, and that really started messing with my really started messing with  my psyche. psyche. <br/>Probst: After tribal council, Christina confronted her accusers. <br/>For the past few days, you guys have been kind of rude, and I've notice it,  like when it comes to passing things. You snapped at me twice. <br/>I said you were annoying. It's just the way... I mean, it's just the way it is. <br/>I never thought that's what they thought of me. But I'm going to stick my head up high still. You know, I've gone through a lot of stuff. I've been shot and all that stuff. I mean, yeah, that's a tragedy of my life. I know I survived a lot of other things in my life, and I'll survive this. <br/>Probst: But the next day, Christina couldn't let it go. <br/>I'm not a robot. Just because I'm a cop doesn't mean I don't have emotions. I have emotions just like you and anyone else. <br/>Right. <br/>And you know what? I was going to say something, and I'm like, "You know, what? If they have a problem, they'll say something to me." And I actually asked  Adam in the boat, "Is everything okay? Why are you yelling?" You didn't say anything about You didn't say  anything about being annoying. being annoying. <br/>I'm just like, settle down. I mean, it just... it's nerve[1]racking  sometimes. <br/>Well, then you should have said something. <br/>I said you were annoying. <br/>No, you didn't say it. <br/>I don't know how else to tell you. <br/>Honestly, you didn't say it. I swear to God you didn't say it, and I never swear to God. <br/>Well, I swear I did. <br/>Maybe you thought you did. <br/>Christina, I said it to you. <br/>Nope. <br/>She said over and over again that she wished we would tell her the way she is  and be open and up front. You know, if she needs to know it, then I'll tell her. <br/>Probst: At the challenge... Good news/bad news. Good news is the winners will feast. Bad news is you'll be feasting at tribal council, because win or lose, both  tribes are going to tribal council tonight. <br/>Ooh! <br/>Probst: Go! <br/>Let go. <br/>Probst: Aitu endured a brutal test of physical strength... Jonathan and Yul  taking on Nate. ...and handed Raro a beat down. Aitu wins the challenge! Here's how it's going to work tonight. Aitu will go to tribal council first. You will vote somebody out. You will then enjoy your feast while listening in on Raro's tribal council. Thinking Jonathan had the immunity idol, Cao Boi dreamed up a scheme to get  the idol out up a scheme to get the idol out in the open. in the open. <br/>Plan Voodoo would split our votes between Jonathan and Candice. I think the plan is ingenious. I know that neither Jonathan or Candice has the immunity idol, because I have  it. <br/>Probst: At tribal council... Sixth person voted out of Survivor: Cook Islands. ...Plan Voodoo never came to fruition. Cao Boi, the tribe has spoken. And Cao Boi's wild ways finally got him voted him out. <br/>I was perfectly comfortable in terms of survival. It was the human element that I overlooked. The Puka tribe caught me by surprise. I thought their parents had taught them honor. I thought they would know what's right and what's wrong about not screwing  somebody over or back[1]stabbing  anybody, but I guessed it wrong. <br/>Probst: After Cao Boi's departure, Aitu indulged in a succulent reward...  People in our group plain out said, "You're annoying."  Probst: ...while listening in on Raro's drama. <br/>Unfortunately, she just found out our true feelings. <br/>Probst: Then another surprise. Aitu, you will now kidnap one member from the Raro tribe. They will be a part of your tribe through the next reward challenge. Aitu, who are you going to kidnap? <br/>Nate. <br/>Probst: Nate, I owe you some food. Nate had a hearty meal... Seventh person voted out of the Cook Islands... ...before  Christina was sent packing. Christine, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Being a police officer, you know, you would think you come into a game  playing it a certain way and use my experience. But you know, at the same time, you realize you're human. You're a person. You're going to have emotions. You're going to go through different things like anyone else. I would do it all over again, and I'm glad I got the opportunity to do it. <br/>Probst: Where 20 once stood, only 13 remain. How will Nate's time at the Aitu tribe affect strategy? <br/>I've got my eyes open very much. <br/>Probst: What further adventures will the survivors face next? What future twists will impact the game. The losing tribe will take back to camp with them this bottle. You have ten seconds to decide whether or not you change your fate in this  game.

I'd rather be on the same page and know what's going on. <br/>Probst: ...Nate causes stress for Aitu. <br/>I was a little bit uneasy about the fact that they we're having this  conversation right in front of Nate. <br/>He looks like a monkey. <br/>Probst: Ozzy's stock skyrockets. <br/>Good job, Oz. <br/>Probst: And one exiled  Probst: And one exiled survivor takes a beating. survivor takes a beating.
