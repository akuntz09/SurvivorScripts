<br/>Â Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: Drop your  buffs, we are switching tribes. The fans and favorites were mixed, putting an  even number of fans and favorites on both sides.  <br/>Oh, don't look so pissed off.  <br/>Jeff: After the switch, it became obvious how much the  fans suffered.  <br/>I'm amazed they're still alive, poor things. They should  be dead.  <br/>Jeff: And how much the favorites thrived.  <br/>Those guys are tough as nails.  <br/>Jeff: The new Airai gelled immediately... Airai wins!  ...and went on a winning streak. But they lost Jonathan due it an  injury.  <br/>I couldn't have done anything else. They did everything  they could They did everything they could do. do.  <br/>Jeff: On Exile Island, Ozzy found the hidden immunity idol  and replaced it with a fake one as a decoy, which was discovered by  Jason.  <br/>I guess this is the hidden immunity idol.  <br/>Help me, help me, somebody.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie is losing it.  <br/>Help me, help me!  <br/>Jeff: Airai has it! When the new Malakal lost their third  challenge in a row, Chet volunteered to be voted out. And at tribal council  Erik received two throwaway votes...  <br/>I vowed never to vote for Chet.  <br/>Jeff: ...and Chet got the rest... Sixth person voted out  of Survivor: Fans Versus Favorites,Chet. ...leaving two fans, Tracy and Erik,  on Ozzy's tribe. 13 are left. 13 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who  will be voted out tonight?  <br/>A lot of crab.  <br/>A lot of crab.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>I think we should have the damn thing cut open right now.  It's only laying two eggs anyway.  <br/>Well, let's kill them right now, all three of them. Oh,  the chicken issue. Come on, girls. I think Tracy started it for some reason.  I'm going to blame it on Tracy. We've got three chickens that lay three eggs  almost every single day. Hey, it's a renewable resource. You want to take out  a renewable resource? That makes no sense.  <br/>Like, you're not going to kill them as soon as some more  people get off so you can have more meat for yourself?  <br/>No. No. Not going to happen.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter the way this game  works.  <br/>It's three weeks, three chickens.  <br/>Tracy is breeding a lot of insecurity around camp. Of  course, she's trying to play the game. She's trying to scramble to save her  own ass, but we don't need that. Look at this-- crabs. We've got massive  crabs. There's plenty of other food. We just have to, like, get it.  <br/>Ozzy is in control of this tribe. He's like the kingpin.  He tells you what you can and can't do. He tells you when you're going to  eat. He cooks the food and then we have to wait until Ozzy says eat it. It's  crazy. I mean, it's just crazy. Ozzy is going to win this thing if we don't  get him out of this if we don't get him out of this game. game.

I just want to  get clean. Oh, yeah. Another day in the lap of luxury. How do we do it,  ladies?  <br/>They complain about the rain. But they didn't get wet  because we were in the cave. I mean, you could be like it was before--  outside, under a bush, getting pummeled by this rain.  <br/>I bet nothing can capture the true essence of the stench  and this funk.  <br/>And how filthy we are right now.  <br/>Deal with the funk. It couldn't have smelled any better  than what they were in before. Just relax. We're not going to be here  forever. This is a game called called Survivor.  <br/>I don't even see where there's...  <br/>A sign of hope?  <br/>No.  <br/>Is my face just dirty?  <br/>This is just the stupidest thing I ever did in my life.  Probably because I'm just... I'm crabby. I'm not a morning person.  <br/>Oh, baby.  <br/>The moods out here are you're on one day and feeling good,  and the next day it's just all crap. Today, this morning is a crap day.  <br/>Could we just get a day of sunshine, please? Wash and dry  our clothes.  <br/>Oh, my god. Thinking of home and my washer and dryer and  my food and my daughter and my husband, and... Well, it's going to make me  cry. It's going to make me want to be there. Nope, still here. Nope, still  here. Damn! Damn!  <br/>Ozzy is amazing. I honestly like Ozzy. He's an awesome  guy, and I want to learn. I want to grow. I want to go outside the small  scope that I've lived in and just see a lot more of the world. And everybody  thinks Ozzy is, look, the wonderkid, or whatever. And I'm just like, "I  can do that. I can climb a coconut tree, too."  <br/>Some of them look like they're stable, but then you'll  pull it, and they'll just pull right off. When you grab the green palm frond,  give it a little test.  <br/>Erik and Ozzy are like The Lion King,the father, when he  was teaching the cub. And you can just see, like, stars. Whenever he says  Ozzy's name, like, stardust comes out of his mouth. Erik just is like,  "Ozzy..."  <br/>A couple of more steps and you're there.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Cool, huh? Good job, dude.  <br/>They're bonding right now.  <br/>Oh, my god.  <br/>Yes!  <br/>You've got good nuts now.  <br/>I think if Ozzy were to propose marriage to Erik right  now, done deal.  <br/>I want to move the boat.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>To the back beach.  <br/>Oh, wow.  <br/>It makes way more sense to have it on that side. It will  be fast.  <br/>They asked me to help move the boat to the back beach.  We'd better be able to get back, I know that, before it's sundown. Everybody  knows, it's no secret, I'm not a strong swimmer, but being a team player, you  think you can get more fish on the back beach, I'll help you row to back  beach, I'll help you row to the back beach. the back beach. When we get way  out in the middle of nowhere, and Ozzy decides, "well, the reef is right  there, come on, we can get really big fish at the reef," I'm nervous as  hell. I've never been out that far in the ocean in a little wooden the ocean  in a little wooden boat. boat.  <br/>I can see! I can see what you can see! Yeah, you.  <br/>Just trust me for a little bit. There could be a giant  clam out there that will feed us for the rest of the time. Maybe there will  be a pearl in there I can give Cirie for paddling out here.  <br/>Ozzy is about numero uno,and  <br/>Ozzy is about numero uno,and that's Oscar. that's Oscar.  Yay, reef, reef.  <br/>Cirie! Oh, you're unhappy!  <br/>So they'll have this little reef adventure at my expense  today, but it won't happen today, but it won't happen again. again.  again.  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! Airai getting your first look at  the new Malakal tribe. Chet voted out at the last Chet voted out at the last  tribal council. tribal council. You guys ready to get to today's  challenge?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: This is a traditional Micronesian money stone. For  years, these stones were the currency in Micronesia. The larger the stone,  the more value. Today they're a part of your challenge. For today's  challenge, four of you will be blindfolded. The other two tribe members will  use verbal direction to guide you as you push a giant money stone through the  jungle course. Along the way, you will crush the tiles at four stations  revealing a pair of smaller money stones. You'll then use those eight stones  to solve a rotating cog puzzle. First tribe to get it right wins reward. Want  to know what you're playing for?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: Close your eyes and imagine you're under a beautiful  refreshing waterfall.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Oh, god!  <br/>Jeff: And you're cleaning your body, and you're washing  your hair.  <br/>Oh, you got to...  <br/>That's your reward. It is the herbal essence great escape  spa. The winning tribe will be taken to an island. You'll have plenty of  products. You can wash up, get clean. When you're finished, a nice little  snack to round out the day. Worth playing for?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Absolutely.  <br/>Jeff: In addition, the winning tribe will send one member  from the losing tribe to Exile Island. You will also choose somebody, again,  from your own tribe to join them. Airai, you have one extra member. Who is  going to sit this one out?  <br/>I am.  <br/>Jeff: All right, Natalie, take a spot over here. Give the  rest of you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right, here we go.  For reward. Survivors ready? Go!  <br/>Come on, guys. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come  on, come on, come on. Keep coming.  <br/>Okay, follow my voice, follow my voice. Keep coming  straight.

Right, right, right.  <br/>Okay, stop! Come across!  <br/>Jeff: Malakal is through their first tile.  <br/>Keep going. Okay, you're at the thing. You feel it? You've  got to pivot left a little. Okay, straight. Keep going! Keep going. Straight.  There you go. You broke the stone.  <br/>Jeff: Airai is through the first tile. They have their  first two money stones.  <br/>To your left. No, no, I'm sorry. To your right. To your  right.  <br/>Okay, now toward the left, toward the left, toward the  left, toward the left.  <br/>Now back up.

Got it, got it!  <br/>Jeff: Malakal smashes their second tile.  <br/>Perfect, perfect! Straight. Okay, you broke it.  <br/>Jeff: Airai smashes their second tile.  <br/>Over here. Come on, come on!  <br/>Haul ass! Go, go, go!  <br/>Stop! Now come forward. Slow, slow.  <br/>Jeff: Malakal lined up for their third tile, and they have  it.  <br/>Over here!  <br/>Jeff: One tile left to break before you start working on  that puzzle.  <br/>Come straight towards me, straight toward me. It didn't  break. It didn't break. Back it up. Back it up, back it up.  <br/>Which way do we move it now?  <br/>Shut up and listen!  <br/>Pivot right, pivot right. Now come straight through, come  straight through. Yes.  <br/>Jeff: Airai smashes their third tile.  <br/>Turn to your right a little more. Straight across, right  now!  <br/>Jeff: Cirie not messing around. They're straight through.  Malakal has all eight. Start working on the puzzle. Three people.  <br/>Okay, you're almost at the last one guys. Keep coming  straight. Okay, now, perfect. You should be able to come straight through.  Yes, good job, good job, good job.  <br/>Jeff: Airai has their eighth and final money stone. Start  working on the puzzle. It's Erik, Cirie, and Ozzy working for Malakal. Eliza,  Kathy, and James working the puzzle for Airai. This puzzle will only go  together one way. That does not mean certain pieces won't fit in and appear  to be right and still be wrong.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Jeff: It is trial and error.  <br/>There we go.  <br/>I don't think you have to force it that much.  <br/>Jeff: James hoping it's in the right spot.  <br/>This one right here. This one right here. This is  right.  <br/>Jeff: Eliza, James, Kathy, not making much progress.  <br/>That's it, that's it, Ozzy.  <br/>Jeff: Malakal thinks they're getting closer.  <br/>We need one more. Do we got it?  <br/>We got it! Jeff!  <br/>Jeff: Malakal thinks they have it. have it. Malakal wins  reward! Malakal wins reward!  <br/>Yes!  <br/>Jeff: Malakal, congratulations.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Jeff: Nice big reward coming your way. First things  first-- choosing somebody from Airai to go to Exile Island.  <br/>Jason.  <br/>Jeff: Jason, you're going back to Exile Island. Now,  Malakal, you have to choose somebody from your own tribe to go to Exile  Island, which means they will not go on the spa reward.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Wow!  <br/>Can you take one for the team?  <br/>Me? Oh, god. I'm going to Exile.  <br/>Jeff: All right, Tracy, Jason, get your stuff. Jason, get  your stuff. The boat's waiting on you. The boat's waiting on you. Airai, got  nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Head  back to camp. Malakal, come get your stuff. Malakal, come get your stuff. The  boat is waiting for you. The boat is waiting for you.  <br/>Yeah! Oh, damn! [ cheering]  <br/>Muffins.  <br/>Cookies!  <br/>It was so funny to see Erik. For one, he was experiencing  a reward for the first time since he's been here.  <br/>I am so happy right now.  <br/>It was really cool. I mean, he's like a wide-eyed kid in a  candy store. It made me feel proud that we were able to win and bring him in  and let him experience this.  <br/>That was nice.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>What is that? I think that's our shower right there.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>You want to go shower?  <br/>I'll come scrub your back when you're halfway  through.  <br/>Oh, yeah!  <br/>Oh, my gosh.  <br/>Oh, yeah!  <br/>Ami, come on!  <br/>I'm getting naked. I don't care.  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>Everyone, get naked.  <br/>My goodness. Ooh-wee. I don't know. I just looked over and  there's, like, a couple of pair of boobs, and Ozzy's head smack dab in the  middle. I'm like, "Okay." The only thing funnier was Erik drooling  from the sight. [ laughs] Hey, to each his own. If you feel free like that,  then by all means, get free. I just wouldn't do it.  <br/>Oh, oh, man. This is as perfect as I could This is as  perfect as I could have ever hoped for. have ever hoped for.  <br/>This came on so fast.  <br/>It's a freaking mon-freakingsoon.  <br/>It just came out of nowhere.  <br/>It's completely different. You watch this show at home,  and when they show the rain, they show it for, like, 30 seconds. They're not  showing that you're standing in the rain or trying to sleep while you're  being rained on for five, six hours rained on for five, six hours straight,  non-stop. straight, non-stop. We had to stand out there, and James went out  in the rain and caught a clam, and we had to sit around and eat a raw clam,  because there's no fire, and you're all just digging in it with your hands  like you're animals.  <br/>You guys okay if I put a little on my lemon?  <br/>You people are disgusting. I was just talking about how I  think...  <br/>And it's full of sand, and it's full of dirt. And the  coconut you're cleaning falls on the ground, but you don't care. You just put  it back in, because it's food. And it's just savagery. It's like you're  cavemen, you know? Never in a million years would I Never in a million years  would I ever do this twice. ever do this twice.  <br/>Is it scary in there?  <br/>It just rained, and it rained, and we crawled way down  into the cave. And it's miserable. And it's awful. And it's dirty. And you  don't even know what's dead and crawling. Son of a bitch! We sleep in the  caves with bats and rats and crawly things.  <br/>Ow!  <br/>It's hard to explain that experience, that it's just...  it's just so uncomfortable. It's so unpleasant. And I said it myself the  other day, "This is the stupidest thing I've ever done in my life. This  is the dumbest thing I've This is the dumbest thing I've ever done."  ever done." Well, when I woke up this morning, I hadn't gotten any  sleep. Again, we were in the cave. It rained all night. And I was looking for  some kind of strength, and I couldn't find it. I was thinking of putting some  wood on the beach, but I don't know how high the tide will come in. Can I  have one more hug, one more? I need one more hug to get me through the day.  I'm just so out of it, James.  <br/>It's okay. Everybody has their days.  <br/>You know, I was trying to send... it sounds so stupid. I  was trying to send, like, vibes to my daughter, Maddie. You know, "Can  you hear me? You can feel me? I need your help. I need your help to help me  through this because I can't do this." And I couldn't... I couldn't feel  her. feel her. I can't feel my family. I can't feel my family. I don't know  what it is, but I'm just downward spiraling, and I can't take another minute,  I can't. I can't. I know it's sunny, it's beautiful, it's like,  "Ooh," But I can't. I can't be here one more minute. I can't take  it. And I just want you guys to be okay and not hate me for it. I just can't  take it one more I just can't take it one more minute, I can't. minute, I  can't.  <br/>You have to be 100% sure.  <br/>I'm 100% sure. I can't. I can't do it anymore.  <br/>Not to make light of how you're feeling, but we all feel  like that today. We're all going bananas. And I'm not trying to make light of  what's going on in your head.  <br/>It's a tough day.  <br/>It's just a hard day.  <br/>Let's walk in the sun a little bit.  <br/>Come here, come here.  <br/>I want to go now.  <br/>It's okay. I want them to come and get a boat and pick me  up and take me away, because I can't do this anymore. I can't. I tried so  hard.  <br/>I know, sweetie, I know.  <br/>I tried so hard.  <br/>I know.  <br/>I think it was a horrible night, and I think it just took  its toll on Kathy. Kathy just really got in her head today. Like, everything  just compiled and built up one upon another, and she's just severely  depressed.  <br/>I just want to go.  <br/>She just came up to us on the beach, bawling, crying, and  told us that she can't take another day out here and she has to go. Like,  she's done. Like, she's done. She's quitting the game. She's quitting the  game.  <br/>Jeff: Hello, guys.  <br/>Hi.  <br/>Hi.  <br/>Jeff: So, well, I got word that you wanted to see me.  You've had enough? What's going on? It's 19 days you've been out here.  <br/>I know.  <br/>Jeff: Let me come over... let me just come over  here.  <br/>I kind of sat on the boat for a while today, and I  couldn't feel my family, you know? And I'm never leaving my baby girl or  husband again ever for this amount of time, ever again.  <br/>Jeff: So what is it that... you've had a tough time out  here. You've had as tough... you've had it as tough as anybody with all the  time on Exile. But you've weathered all that. So you want to leave, you're  leaving. There's no... I'm not here to talk you into staying. That's for  sure.  <br/>Right.  <br/>Jeff: I just want to understand it.  <br/>I was doing it for everybody else. Doing it for my  husband. Doing it for my sister who wants to live vicariously through me. I  don't want to hurt these people. So I want to stay to help them. This is,  like, the first decision I've made that's, like, for me, you know, because I  don't want to let anybody down. I don't want anybody to hate me. I don't want  anybody to think that I'm quitting.  <br/>Jeff: This adventure means different things to different  people. It represents different things to different people. You've certainly  given it your best.  <br/>Yeah. Oh, god.  <br/>Jeff: And all's going to be okay. Ready to get out of  here?  <br/>I am.  <br/>I am.  <br/>Jeff: Let's get your stuff.  <br/>Jeff: Let's get your stuff.  <br/>I'm sorry, guys.  <br/>Don't apologize.  <br/>Don't apologize.  <br/>I'm sorry.  <br/>I'm sorry.  <br/>You know, Kathy's been through a lot, and most of it is  she lost most of her motivation. So what's the point of going through the  suffering?  <br/>It was nice to get to know you these last couple of  days.  <br/>She just said she's had enough, and she's quitting. Which  is sad, but still and all, I mean, it's up to her. You can't fault her. You  can't be upset with her. Hope she has a good trip, and I'm sure I'll see her  again.  <br/>Jeff: So the Airai tribe is down to six in spite of  winning challenges. Game continues. Game continues. See you soon. See you  soon.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Kathy leaving, it's sad, but at the same time, life goes  on here, and there's a reality to the fact that the sun is going down, and we  haven't had water in three days, and we haven't had a cooked meal because we  haven't had fire. You know, so Survivorcontinues You know, so  Survivorcontinues for the rest of us. for the rest of us.  <br/>I think you got a dose of who Oscar really is with the  boat ride yesterday. And...  <br/>I'm starting to see that.  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>He's kind of arrogant.  <br/>You think?  <br/>Kind of bothering me.  <br/>Hmm. Amanda got to see how there's a selfish, arrogant  part to Ozzy.  <br/>It's so sad. Very sad.  <br/>And if I got that out of the trip, then, okay, I can suck  it up, because there was a benefit to it-- letting her see, you know, Ozzy is  about Ozzy.  <br/>I don't know. Like, I've been trying to figure out if  people really think Ozzy is, like, the best thing in the world or if they're  just playing.  <br/>Did you hear Erik? "Oh, my god, if he wasn't here  we'd die." It's like, "Shut up, Erik." How can we vote Erik,  though? How many of us is it? Because Ozzy is not going to vote Erik. He's  kind of in love with Erik right now. They climbed that coconut tree. And  because he just worships the ground that he walks on, he'll never get rid of  Erik.  <br/>I think it's the best move to make.  <br/>To get rid of Erik?  <br/>Maybe.  <br/>Ozzy's not going to do it.  <br/>We just have to let him think he's in complete  control.  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>You know what I'm saying?  <br/>You know what I'm saying?  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys.  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. Malakal, getting your first look  at the new Airai tribe. Kathy has left the game.  <br/>Kathy?  <br/>What?  <br/>Jeff: We'll bring Jason and Tracy in from Exile. I'll  explain what happened.  <br/>Well, hello!  <br/>Hi.  <br/>Hey.  <br/>Jeff: Let me kitchen everybody up on what's going on.  Yesterday, Kathy sent word that she wanted out of the game. I went over to  Airai's camp. She said, "I've had enough. I need to go." We packed  up her belongings. She quit. Both tribes at six. All right, you guys ready to  get to today's immunity challenge?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: First things first.  <br/>Jeff: First things first. Give it up, Eliza. Give it up,  Eliza. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. On my go, one member of  each tribe will race across a floating bridge carrying one end of a piece of  rope. When you reach the platform, you'll clip the rope into a large puzzle  piece, and then hang on as the rest of the tribe will crank a giant winch,  pulling you and the puzzle piece back to shore. Once you've collected all  five puzzle pieces, two tribe members will unfold those bundles and use the  pieces to solve a puzzle in the form of a perfect square. Make sense?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: I'll give you a minute to strategize, we'll get  started. Eliza and Ozzy first off. Here we go, for immunity, Survivors ready?

Natalie losing a lot  of time for Airai. Ozzy's coming back with that fifth and final piece.  Natalie's at the platform and clipped in.  <br/>Hold on!  <br/>Jeff: Malakal pulling him back. Ozzy really working it  like it's a board. Malakal has all five pieces. Go! Two puzzle makers.  <br/>Go, go, go!  <br/>Jeff: Amanda and Cirie start working on the puzzle for  Malakal. Eliza heads out for that fifth and final puzzle piece per Airai.  Malakal already working on that puzzle with a big lead. This puzzle will form  a perfect square.  <br/>Go, go, go!  <br/>Jeff: Eliza clips in to the fifth puzzle piece for Airai.  The quicker you get started, the faster you will finish. Eliza back with the  final piece! Go! Jason and Eliza going to work on the puzzle. Amanda and  Cirie working on the puzzle for Malakal. Immunity on the line.  <br/>You guys are doing great!  <br/>Jeff: These pieces are heavy, going to be hard to move.  Jason and Eliza still untying.  <br/>It's okay, guys, get them untied.  <br/>We've got them untied. We just need to get them out. Help  me get them out.  <br/>Jeff: Malakal with a big lead already starting to work on  this puzzle. Eliza and Jason have all five of their pieces untied. They're  starting to work on forming the puzzle.  <br/>Use that one.  <br/>This one?  <br/>Right here, yeah. Push that one over, Amanda!  <br/>Jeff: Amanda and Cirie now starting to struggle a bit.  Jason and Eliza have a different strategy, spreading all the piss out,  looking for patterns.  <br/>Help her pull this one! Help her pull this one!  <br/>Jeff: Cirie and Amanda really slowing down. Eliza and  Jason starting to make a little progress.  <br/>This one at the bottom?  <br/>Yeah, yeah. Flip it around. There you go. There you  go.  <br/>Turn it, turn it! Right here, right here.  <br/>That one might be the center.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie and Amanda taking their time.  <br/>That one right there, that one right there. Right in the  middle.  <br/>Jeff: Eliza and Jason trying to shove one last piece in.  Will it fit? Is it right? Is it right? Airai wins immunity! Airai wins  immunity! Airai, congratulations. Immunity is yours once again. For the third  straight time, Airai wins immunity, safe from tribal council. Malakal, tribal  council tonight, where one of you is going home. Grab your stuff. See you  there. Airai, head out. Airai, head out. Nice job. Nice job.  <br/>Hey, Oz, I'm so sorry about the puzzle. I feel like crap  about it.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah. It was so easy. It was so easy.  <br/>So then who do we choose?  <br/>I think it just makes more sense if Tracy...  <br/>Ozzy is wanting Erik to stay because he's got a good  relationship going with Erik, but I just feel like I can work more with  Tracy. She's more into the game, and being third or fourth among Cirie, Ozzy,  and Amanda is something that's definitely always on my mind. Could I betray  him if it comes down to that? Sometimes you have to pull the dirty cards to  stay in the game. Let me tell you what's happening. The girls want to get rid  of Erik. Ozzy wants to get rid of you. It was his idea to send you to  Exile.  <br/>I know.  <br/>And so if we can get Ozzy to vote for you and us three  girls to vote for, Erik, then you, me, and Erik can vote for Ozzy and get  Ozzy out of here.  <br/>The plan that Tracy and I talked about is talk Amanda and  Cirie into voting for Erik, which they want to do anyway. Tell them that I'll  vote with them. Go for that. We all three say we're voting for Erik. Ozzy  doesn't know, and doesn't want to vote for Erik, so he'll vote for Tracy,  thinking we're all going to vote for Tracy. Well, underneath all of that, Tracy,  Erik, and I are going to vote for Ozzy, and just take vote for Ozzy, and just  take Ozzy out at the knees. Ozzy out at the knees.  <br/>Mm-hmm. You're next after me. If you think you are.  <br/>In order to pull off voting out Ozzy at this point, we  have to either pull in Cirie and Amanda. If this doesn't work out, I have to  vote Tracy. If I voted Ozzy with Tracy, they would flip out, and I would be  would flip out, and I would be so done, whatever came next. so done, whatever  came next.  <br/>Well, I know Ozzy wants me. But I'd like to stay. And you  got to think right now what you're going to do. Would you rather go up  against me or would you rather go up against Ozzy? Would you rather go up  against Erik or would you rather go up Erik or would you rather go up against  me? against me? As long as you two say that that's good.  <br/>So you feel like Erik, right, because of...  <br/>Well, yeah. Are you? Do you think that's the best  decision?  <br/>I'm just nervous about what Ozzy might have planned on the  other side with Erik and those girls.  <br/>If I was definitely set on wanting Erik out tonight, he'd  be gone tonight. I guarantee you. But I don't know at this point if I will be  able to turn on Ozzy or not. If I go against Ozzy, then I can pretty much  kiss that relationship good-bye. I mean, there are so many people that you  have to vote out. You're going to hurt someone's feelings in this game.  feelings in this game. It's inevitable. It's inevitable.  <br/>Don't look at me!  <br/>If Cirie and Amanda don't vote with me, there's a whole  other path that could be taken. I'm kind of going both ways in my head still.  Am I going to take Ozzy out, or am I going to stick with these people that  I've known from the beginning and vote out one of the fans? Tonight's  decision is a very big decision. It could change the game in a It could  change the game in a serious way. serious way.  <br/>Jeff: Let's get straight to it. This tribe is obviously in  trouble. You've lost three straight immunity challenges. The only reason  you're even halfway in it is because of odd circumstances-- Penner having to  be medically pulled out of the game, and Kathy deciding to quit. Tracy, who  is leading this tribe?  <br/>Ozzy. Ozzy is leading this tribe. I mean, Ozzy was the  first one that looked at me and said, "You need to go to Exile Island  for the tribe." Ozzy tells us who is going to compete, when you're going  to eat, and what you're going to eat.  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy, you had a big reaction when Tracy said you're  the leader.  <br/>Oh, yeah, just... it's ridiculous. If I'm the leader of  this tribe, I haven't known about it. I do what needs to get done at certain  times, but I really don't feel like I'm the leader of the tribe. And I  definitely don't feel like I'm deciding who eats what when. That doesn't make  any sense, and doesn't jibe with me at all.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie, somebody's got to be leading the tribe to one  degree or another.  <br/>In a way I kind of see where Tracy's coming from. I'm not  saying that Ozzy is the leader of the tribe, but just about 90% of everything  that we do, everyone checks with Ozzy first.  <br/>Jeff: Erik, do you see what everybody's talking about, the  dynamics right now?  <br/>There's a conflict going on. There's a conflict in this  tribe. And, I mean, I understand Ozzy's point. Nobody wants to be the leader,  but things need to get done. Things need to happen, and he's doing so much  for this tribe. If he was gone, we would fall apart faster than we are right  now.  <br/>Jeff: Ami, there are two different approaches this tribe  could take right now-- short- term thinking, which is, "We need to win  challenges." Long-term thinking is, "I need to start getting rid of  people who could beat me in this game." Take me down that line.  <br/>Well, you always have to be looking out for, "Which  one of these people is going to be the biggest threat to me, and when's the  best time to get rid of them?" And you've got to play your cards when it  makes the most sense.  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy, when you hear Ami talking about getting rid of  the people more threatening, make you a little concerned?  <br/>Oh, yeah, it does. I'm not that naive to think that people  don't want me gone even if they need me to win challenges. I'm still going to  give it my all, and I'm still going to be loyal to the people that I've said  I'm going to be loyal to. Nothing's going to change that. So if I'm a threat  and people want to get rid of me, you know, that's one strategy. But the  other strategy is they can be with me and we can try and go to the end  together.  <br/>Jeff: Tracy, why keep you tonight?  <br/>I think I'd be a better tribe member than somebody's  that's going to demolish you if you do go to the merge. And I think that's  that needs to be a thought that all these people need to think about. I would  be less of a threat than Ozzy to Ami, to Amanda, to Cirie, than Ozzy. It's  just as simple as that. It's black and white. There's no gray.  <br/>Jeff: All right, let's get to it. It is time to vote. It  is time to vote. Amanda, you're up. Amanda, you're up.  <br/>You said you were honest, and  <br/>You said you were honest, and that's bull. that's  bull.  <br/>This is because you wanted me out. Good player. Good  player. No hard feelings. No hard feelings.  <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the  <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has the  hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be time to play it,  now would be time to do so. do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the  decision is final.

He's out!  <br/>Going up against the favorites was quite difficult. Ozzy's  a wonderful player in this game. He is manipulative and he is strategic. He  will definitely take the rest of the tribe down. They need to get rid of him  ASAP or else they don't stand a chance. I wish I could have stayed in longer.  I went out kicking. I did everything I could, and I did everything I could,  and I'm just grateful to be here.
