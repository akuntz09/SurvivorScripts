<br/>Jeff: We're onboard a 38- squadron Caribou DHC-4 military  aircraft on loan from the Royal Australian Air Force. Normally, these planes are used to rescue people in dangerous,  life threatening situations. Today, however, we have a different mission. These 16 Americans are about to be abandoned. This plane will land in the heart of one of the most unforgiving  places anywhere on earth: the Australian outback. For the next 42 days, they'll be left to fend for themselves,  forced to work together to create a new society while battling the elements  and each other. They must learn to adapt, or they'll be voted from the tribe. In the end, one will remain and will claim the million-dollar  prize. 42 days, 16 people, one survivor. [ retching] survivor. [ retching] As this plane touches down on a remote strip of land  in the Australian outback, these 16 strangers begin the adventure of a  lifetime. They have never spoken to each other, and the rules state they  must remain quiet until after the plane has landed, dropped them off, and  abandoned them. They have been separated into two competing tribes: Kucha and  Ogakor. One crate of supplies awaits each tribe, and once the plane has  taken off, they will have only five minutes to salvage whatever they can  carry. They then face a grueling 5-mile hike that will take them deep  into the outback and their new homes for the next 42 days. The Kucha tribe, which will always wear blue, consists of Kimmi  Kappenberg, a bartender from Long Island; Michael Skupin, a father and  software publisher and distributor from White Lake, Michigan; Alicia Calaway,  a personal trainer from New York City; Rodger Bingham, a farmer and school  teacher from Crittenden, Kentucky; Elisabeth Filarsky, a footwear designer from  Newton, Massachusetts; Nick Brown, a Harvard law student from San Francisco;  Debb Eaton, a corrections officer from Berlin, New Hampshire; and Jeff  Varner, an Internet projects manager from Greensboro, North Carolina. <br/>Jeff V.: Whoo! So cold. <br/>Jeff: Ogakor tribe, which will always wear green, consists  of Maralyn Hershey, a retired police officer from Wakefield, Virginia; Colby  Donaldson, an auto customizer from Christoval, Texas; Amber Brkich, an  administrative assistant from Beaver, Pennsylvania; Mitchell Olson, a  singer-songwriter from Vermillion, South Dakota; Tina Wesson, a mother and  personal nurse from Knoxville, Tennessee; Keith Famie, a chef from West  Bloomfield, Michigan; Jerri Manthey, an aspiring actress from Los Angeles,  and Kel Gleason, an Army intelligence officer from Fort Hood, Texas. [ cheering]  Nick: Wait, guys, there's got a be a way to prop it open,  I think. <br/>Amber: "Welcome to the Australian Outback. As of right now, you are "completely cut off from the  outside world."  Alicia: "These are the only supplies you'll be given. Choose wisely, since you still "have a long way to carry  them. Fresh water is essential to your survival. "Unfortunately, all of the water you will need for the next  few days must be taken from your box "because the river water must be  boiled, and you may not be able to make a fire."  Debb: We're Kucha? <br/>Kucha? <br/>Amber: Ogakor. <br/>Maralyn: Ogre Kor. <br/>Amber: Ogakor. <br/>Tina: We have the map. <br/>Nick: Start... I guess we're starting here. <br/>Elisabeth: Yeah. <br/>Nick: Okay, that's north. <br/>How much do you need? <br/>Debb: I don't know the names yet. In the green hat right here. Can you help her get one side of this undone? <br/>Maralyn: Can we pee soon? <br/>Take every, every everything. <br/>Michael: Come on, guys, we need to go now. <br/>Grab something, all right? <br/>All right, we'll get it, we'll get it. <br/>Jeff: The tribes will split we'll get it. <br/>Jeff: The tribes will split up and head in opposite  directions. Their camps are situated four miles apart, along the shore of  the Herbert River. Each beach has a flag and a canoe. Finding these sites will be the first unofficial challenge for  the new survivors. <br/>Kimmi: Whoever's got the compass... Okay, northeast we  have to go? <br/>Nick: It seems like it's not, but, okay...  Kimmi: That's north. <br/>Nick: That's north right now, so northeast is, like,  across back that way. <br/>Kimmi: That way. We're going the wrong way. We're going the wrong way. <br/>Alicia: When they dropped us off, you know, everybody was  designated a certain thing to do, and, uh, they gave Nick the compass. For some reason, although the compass said one way... we kept  going the wrong way. <br/>Debb: Tell me something. He's telling me we're moving this way. <br/>Alicia: I know we are. Yankees? <br/>Debb: Are we moving in the right direction? <br/>Alicia: Absolutely, all the way, baby. <br/>I think we should check, like every...  Debb: All right, then that's where we're going. Nick? Nick? Stay in the front, Nick, and keep us going north to northeast,  okay, but keep us going north...  Michael: There's a... there's a beaten path. <br/>Kimmi: What's your name again? <br/>Michael: Mike. <br/>Alicia: Mike. <br/>Debb: Let's just stop for one second and look at the map. <br/>Michael: All right. <br/>Debb: And look at the compass. <br/>Michael: All right. <br/>Debb: Just to make sure, 'cause it's a long ways to where  we're going. <br/>Nick: Even from the beginning, I was finding, like, people  were automatically getting on people's nerves. Um, yeah, we were walking through the grass, and Kimmi was like,  "I can't stand, uh, Debb."  Debb: See, if we're going southwest, how are we going to  hit the dry creek bed? <br/>Kimmi: Because that's north! <br/>Debb: That's right, so we're not going to hit it unless we  go that way. <br/>Kimmi: Debb's not even a bad person. She means well. It's just she's not somebody that in the outside world that I  would talk to, because... she'd make me crazy. <br/>Maralyn: When you traverse something that I could bust my  butt on, let me know. The hike, uh... it was a little intimidating. Um, I was afraid. "Good grief, what if I get so winded that I can't keep  up?" Do you see the flag? Wait a minute, hang on. <br/>Colby: You all right, Maralyn? That trek let me know that this was for real. That was a long trek we had through deep sand with a lot of  heavy equipment, and I was packing more weight than anyone else, so I was  really struggling. It was a long trip, and that was... that fired me up, because  that is the quickest way to find out what people are made of. <br/>Amber: [ groans] I'm a little tired. This rice is very heavy. I really want to get there soon. <br/>Colby: We don't know how far away we are, so I'm going to  run up this and do a little reconnaissance, see if we can't find out where  we're at. I figure if it's really far, we'll drape some of our stuff here,  and we won't take it. If we're not far, then we'll buck up and get it there. Yeah, I'm going to keep going. We're just going to follow the creek bed here, and, uh, make  sure if it looks like it's getting too dark, you turn back and come get us. <br/>Jerri: Keith actually ran ahead to go scout out where the  camp was, 'cause we were all getting pretty tired, and the last leg of that  walk was really difficult. <br/>Colby: I wish the snakes difficult. <br/>Colby: I wish the snakes would...  Maralyn: Never let 'em see you sweat. <br/>Kel: Keith? <br/>Keith: Here I come. <br/>Kel: Okay, what do you see? <br/>Keith: I found it. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Yay! <br/>Let's go! <br/>Jerri: Whoo! [ laughing]  Whoo! <br/>Jerri: Whoo! <br/>Yeah! [ cheering] [ grunts]  Jeff V.: I'm feeling really weak, and, um, on the verge of  throwing up just ever since I got here. I mean, it started with the plane flight. In the beginning, it was really fun, and it was kind of cool and  groovy, and I was enjoying the ride, and then all of a sudden, I just got  sort of nauseous, and I kept thinking to myself, 'I'm not going to get sick. 'I'm not going to get sick. I will not throw up.' So I sort of went into this little zone  and breathed, and I don't remember any of it. <br/>Kimmi: Rodger carried one of the big water jugs. Mike had a big water jug. Poor Elisabeth had the board on her head, and then I had the  eight bottled waters wrapped around me, so the-the four of us kind of got  separated from the other four when we were walking to our campground. <br/>Elisabeth: I mean, everything was heavy to carry. You can't discount any of our equipment as easy to carry, but  some of it was just more awkward. And some of the crossings, we had to go, you know, down a sharp  valley of rocks. and up again, and kind of wind and balance across a river. And it was frustrating, too, but with the water jugs and, you  know, the water canteens, and... I mean, that stuff is just awkward. <br/>Oh, I see the flag. awkward. <br/>Oh, I see the flag. Oh, my God! Welcome to our home. <br/>Right up there. <br/>Kimmi: When we arrived, it was just a moment of ecstasy,  'cause it's like, "Yes! I've worked this far just to see this silly thing." I  mean... And not just physically from here, but just mentally preparing  yourself the whole journey, like, all the airplane flights from New York to  California to Australia, from the other part of Australia to here to there. You know, there were just so many things in sequence to get you  to that flag that just being at that flag is just an accomplishment. [ yelling] [ cheering] [ thunder rumbling] [ cheering] [ thunder  rumbling]  Debb: We should be up-up in the trees to some degree. There's no shelter here at all. <br/>Elisabeth: As soon as we got out of the river, I think we  just... this kind of realization. We got a little cold, and we realized that we're going to... we  have to sleep somewhere, and we just wanted to feel a little safe and dry. So we got to work as much as we could on building the basis of a  home. <br/>Debb: We got enough rocks here, too! We could build a pretty decent shelter just using rocks! <br/>Michael: [ groans] It's going to make is softer to sleep  on. <br/>Alicia: Want to see a what? <br/>Debb: That means there's snakes in there. <br/>Michael: When we started building the shelter, I thought  everybody started chipping in, because there was the wood gatherers, and  there was the people that were building, and, uh, I had worked a lot of, uh,  you know, some construction in my life, and I-I had a reasonable sense of,  uh, of-of construction. What we're going to have to do is just cut little holes in here,  and then just tie it around the top here about this high, so that we can just  make it right here. Um, we need one to go right about halfway up along this support  right here. <br/>Debb: It seems like one individual in the group is...  ordering everybody around, and if you guys haven't figured it out, it's Mike. <br/>Michael: Rodger, get the level out and see how we're  doing. <br/>Elisabeth: Okay. <br/>Debb: You can't have one person step in and start ordering  everybody around, 'cause it's not going to play, and it's not playing right  now, and not just with me, but with others. <br/>Michael: Here. Push up. Push that up a little bit, Rodger, so I can give me a little...  Push this up a little bit. <br/>Debb: Rodger used to build homes. Rodger is the one who helped to build this shelter. He knows what he's doing. Well, Mike comes over and starts telling him how to build it,  and-and Rodger was like, "No, that isn't going to work."  Rodger: It's going to give us fall this way plus both  directions. <br/>Michael: I mean, do you think it's enough of a pitch here  to... so the rain's going to come off good? [ grunts] We're never going to want to leave this place. <br/>Rodger: I don't know about that. <br/>Very quickly. <br/>Yeah, we're doing really well. <br/>Keith: All right, so, what makes the most sense as far as  building where we'd want to live? Do we want to live by the water, or do we want to take a walk up  on the high ground and take a look at it? <br/>Maralyn: Well, there's a lot of electrical storms. <br/>Yeah, good point. <br/>There's going to be a lot of bugs down by the water,  though. <br/>Jerri: We want to definitely be under some trees, 'cause,  I mean...  Okay. <br/>Jerri: When the sun comes out, it's going to be hot. <br/>Maralyn: Probably the sun is going to be out at certain  times, so at certain times, there's still going to be shade, based on the  position of the sun. <br/>Do you have a compass with you? <br/>Keith: As soon as we hit the beach, and it was really kind  of amazing, collectively, we all dispersed to do something different. <br/>Jerri: When we got to our camp, I was considering at that  point anything and everything anybody was doing or saying as a strategic  move. <br/>Mitchell: Colby-- his luxury item was the Texan flag,  which was great, because it served as the tarp that covers... covers us and  blocks us from the wind and the sun. <br/>Colby: I really did bring the flag to serve as shelter,  but, you know, don't get me wrong. When I wake up in the morning, there's two things I'm thankful  for: I'm thankful I'm alive, and I'm thankful I'm a Texan. <br/>It's not going to work. <br/>Jerri: We don't need to risk ripping this if there's a  stick that's two inches shorter. <br/>Keith: Yeah, you don't need to go that far, though. <br/>Jerri: It was... No, but it's not going to stay. That's what I'm saying. The tension between Keith and I... I think him and I kind of...  rubbed each other the wrong way. <br/>Keith: Watch, right here, watch. Let me just show you. Right there. <br/>Kel: It's sticking now. <br/>Keith: It's set. It's-it's... That's-that's working. And before it was here. <br/>Jerri: But, see, we put it on the grommet for a reason: so  that the flag wouldn't rip. <br/>Keith: You can't. You won't be able to go through that on a flat surface. <br/>Jerri: Keith and I didn't start off on a very good foot,  just because of some of the condescending mark... remarks he made to me, and  he might very well not even be aware that he does it, but I'm not the kind of  person to just let it slide off my back. All right, all right. <br/>You got to share something about yourself that's really  embarrassing. <br/>Okay. <br/>Embarrassing or just deep? <br/>Kimmi: I just got naked in a tent with a bunch of  strangers. <br/>Rodger: That's what I was getting ready to say. <br/>Alicia: Give us the dirt, girl. <br/>Like boyfriend, husband, wife. <br/>Kimmi: Okay, A, not married. Don't believe in marriage until I'm 35. <br/>Okay, don't say you're a virgin, 'cause I swear to God,  I'll... [ laughter]  Kimmi: I'll tell you what my main concern was: when and  how am I going to masturbate out here with... [ laughter]  You have got to be kidding me! <br/>Debb: Kimmi is a happy-golucky person who's got... I-I  don't even know how to describe her. I don't know what the right word is. You know, nothing is taboo with her-- nothing at all. <br/>Kimmi: Listen to me! You guys might like a skin wig, however... on occasion. <br/>Jeff V.: Kimmi will not shut up. You know, I'm tired at night. I want to go to sleep, and they're constantly talking, and with  the headache that I have, it just reverberates. Kimmi cannot say a single thing without screaming it. <br/>Kimmi: All right, someone just stuck their finger in my  ...! <br/>Debb: Well, it was on my head. <br/>Jeff: All of a sudden, out of the blue, with that accent  that just talks and talks and talks and talks... I just want to grab her by  the neck and shake the ... out of her, you know? <br/>Kimmi: Oh, my God, I love you! I can take my braids out! And you had a threesome. We went back-to-back. You farted in my ... and rebounded it...  Michael: I think we're rebounded it...  Michael: I think we're starting to get to know each other,  and people are not accustomed to this kind of lifestyle yet. I'm a little accustomed to this lifestyle, because I do hunt,  and I do fish, and I do camp, so it's not that foreign to me. Kucha, we got food! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Right, like, right under our noses. <br/>Is it better? <br/>Michael: Yeah, I think you can eat 'em. When I saw those figs, it was a big rush, and two or three  people came over and helped pick the figs, and we brought 'em back, and,  uh... I bit into one right off the tree. [ yelling] [ spitting] [ yelling] Don't! <br/>What? What? What? <br/>Michael: [ spitting] Don't bite into one. <br/>Dang fruit flies. <br/>I know. Well, we're going to put the...  Can we eat 'em green? <br/>Look at that. <br/>That's not bugs, is it? <br/>No, that's not bugs. If they're not... if they're not moving. <br/>Jeff V.: I'm looking at bugs. <br/>Debb: All over the place here with this. <br/>Jeff V.: Let's see. Mike, he opens up these figs, and he's... showing us these bugs,  and I'm just wanting to eat that thing so bad, 'cause I'm starving, and these  bugs are just creepy and flying around, and I don't eat anyth... You know,  I-I cook my food. <br/>Alicia: And if the bugs don't fly out, I'm going to eat  them, so...  Jeff V.: Speak for yourself, baby. <br/>Debb: We very well might be cold and hungry tonight, but  not if we can help it. The fire is the most important thing for survival. We need to eat, and we need to boil water. That's all I care about. If we put enough sand in there, I think it's good. Put that cotton right at the bottom. <br/>Michael: Well, the problem is we get too much sand in  here, we're not... we're... it's dumping on all of our tinder. This wood's not going to catch fire. The tinder's going to catch fire. <br/>Debb: Just... you need to keep that...  Michael: But if you keep putting sand in there, it-it puts  out the tinder. <br/>Debb: I know. It's just that the book said you needed friction. <br/>Kimmi: Debb works very hard, and she means well, but she's  like, "Well, in the camping book, it says to do it like this."  And-and you know what? We could have the wrong wood. We could have the wrong rocks, something. She's making herself an authority on something actively on what  she read and not on actually doing. Had she went and practiced this stuff at home, I would take her  opinion a lot more, you know, seriously. <br/>All right. <br/>Rodger: One thing we tried to do in starting the fire was  use my Bible, which I had brought along. It was my luxury item. And, uh, we tore some pages out of it. Uh, it wasn't the pages that actually had any scripture in it,  but I would've used that. You know, if you're... You got to do with what you got. <br/>Next? <br/>I don't know. I don't...  Rodger: Yeah. There's a letter from my son-inlaw he wrote me. <br/>Oh. <br/>Rodger: Read it. I don't have my glasses. <br/>Kimmi: Do you want me to read it to you out loud...  Rodger: I don't care. I can't; I don't have my glasses. <br/>Kimmi: "Dear Dad, best of luck. "You have many people who believe you can do anything you  "put your mind to. Just be yourself. "Things'll be fine in Kentucky. Focus on your task at hand. "You can do this. It's not going to be easy, but "a challenge such as this  shouldn't be easy. Just try your best."  All right. <br/>Kimmi: It says "KJA", and then he put in  parentheses "141", so I don't know if that...  Rodger: 141? Yeah. <br/>Kimmi: Oh! <br/>That's pretty cool. <br/>Kimmi: You got love notes. <br/>Rodger: That was a nice little piece of home when you...  when you least-least expect it, you know. Then it said go to page 200, and then go to page 150, and we  went through that about seven or eight times, I think, till we... till we  finally came to the end. <br/>Kimmi: Can you give us the page of the burning bush? <br/>Rodger: And it was a little sentimental for me, to tell  you the truth, to... to hear it. <br/>I think you wrote the book, huh? <br/>Keith: My son is in Cub Scouts. If I start this fire, I will be his hero. [ laughter]  Colby: Ooh, this side got hot. <br/>Jerri: Are we far enough away from the water? <br/>Mitchell: Just what I was going to say right there. <br/>Keith: Oh, it doesn't... I think we start the fire, we can  dig anywhere we want to. We pull off making the fire...  Jerri: Well, I don't even really want to attempt to start  it until we get it where we want to keep it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jerri: 'Cause if we move it, it's going out. <br/>Keith: Well, let me keep trying on this. <br/>Jerri: If you get lucky, and you spark that thing, and  it's ready to go, and you try and pick it up and move it, and we don't have  anywhere to put it, then...  Keith: Then I can just keep it burning here and a little  one going, and we can always move this. <br/>Jerri: All right, I'm going to go see if I can find a  better place. <br/>Mitchell: Bad news. <br/>Keith: I've never started a fire before from scratch, but,  you know, I knew nightfall was coming. We'd have no light, and we'd be able to cook nothing, um... and  we wouldn't have a bonfire, so it was... it was pretty critical. <br/>Colby: Keith is just licking his chops. He's wanting to cook so bad, he can't stand it, and so you can  bet he's going to work on this fire thing until we lick it. <br/>Amber: Uh-oh. <br/>Keith: Oh. Since Jerri and I had our little confrontation before, I  thought, you know, this is a great time to get her involved with this  process, to be a part of it somehow, with something she brought that was  important to her. <br/>Jerri: Fire. Ah! <br/>Keith: [ indistinguishable]  Jerri: Whoo! <br/>Keith: I can feel it. <br/>Jerri: Whoo! Oh, my God! [ screams]  Keith: Oh, my God! <br/>Jerri: Wow. Are you guys okay? <br/>Maralyn: Until we can get a fire and boil water... we're  not going to be eating much of anything. <br/>Kimmi: I got the mail...  No way! [ cheering]  Debb: All right! Read it. Read it to me. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>All right, what does it say? <br/>Kimmi: "You expected dry weather, but then you slept  in the rain, and you can't get a "spark no matter how hard you strain. To get your tribe's fire, pay "heed to this note: the  winners take matches, the losers cast first the vote."  Oh! <br/>Debb: Yeah! <br/>Elisabeth: We are getting matches! <br/>When, though? When? <br/>We are definitely...  Matches! <br/>Kimmi: All right, we just got our notice for the first  immunity challenge, and we're going to go kick some butt, 'cause we're all  together on this, and we're going to go get us some fire, and we're going to  go, uh, get us some food. Fire means food, so that's what we're going to go do. We're going to go there, we're going to fight hard and win. <br/>Elisabeth: Winning immunity is the most important thing. We need to... beat, beat, beat the other tribe. We'll let them eliminate someone on their team first. <br/>Mitchell: This immunity challenge is extremely important,  because we have to show the other team that we're better, you know, and plus,  we have to have fire in order to start eating rice. <br/>Jeff: What's up, guys? Gather up. So, uh, anybody have any luck with fire? <br/>Alicia: No luck. We came close. <br/>Almost. <br/>Michael: We got a lot of smoke. <br/>Jeff: All right, I got something that's going to help the  smoke. Waterproof matches. One of the things we're playing for tonight, right here, a  little canister full. We're also playing for something else much more important than  waterproof matches. Right here: the immunity idol. You want to know this guy really well, because the tribe that  wins the immunity idol will not have to go to Tribal Council and vote out one  of their own members. That brings us to challenge number one. You're playing for fire. You're playing for immunity. There are four legs in the race. You'll be carrying a lit torch. If somebody falls in the water at any time and their torch goes  out, your tribe is done. Somebody's going home tomorrow. So that is key. Here's how the game is played. First leg starts at the old bridge. You'll make your way across using two planks to help you bridge  the gaps. On the second leg, you'll cross over the island, where you'll  find, in the water, a small torch-carrying raft. Put your lighted torch on the raft and, as a tribe, swim across  to the other side of the bank. When you get over there, you'll find two sets of wooden rungs. Take them with you. For the third leg, you're going to get on another raft, and  using a rope, pull yourself across the river. Using the rungs, climb up the ladder, light the torch. Winners: maybe a hot meal tonight, security of knowing you're  going to be here a while. Losers: cold, somebody's going to be the first person voted out  of the tribe. Make sense? Let's take our spots, wait for my start. Let's go. All right, at stake, fire... and immunity! Survivors, ready?! <br/>Ready! <br/>Jeff: Go! <br/>We won, we won, we won! Continue to move forward! Move it forward! Move it forward! Go, go, go! <br/>This is a team. This is a team. <br/>Go, go, go, go, let's go. We got it. <br/>Nick: Go, go. Help her a little. Help. Go, go, go. <br/>We're even. Go, guys, run. Go, go, go, go. <br/>Get the fire. Hand on the raft. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Come on, come on! <br/>Alicia: Let's go, let's go. <br/>Put your hand on the raft, Kel. <br/>Rodger: Okay, I'm okay. Go. Kel. <br/>Rodger: Okay, I'm okay. Go. <br/>Debb: Wait. <br/>Wait, his foot's caught. Oh, my God. <br/>Watch your step, watch your Oh, my God. <br/>Watch your step, watch your step! <br/>Alicia: We're almost there. <br/>Work, work, work. <br/>Jerri: Whoo! Yeah! [ cheering]  Mitchell. [ cheering]  Mitchell. <br/>Go. <br/>Back up, back up. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Jerri: Mitchell! <br/>We got it. Don't lean too far right. <br/>Good job! You got it! <br/>Mitchell! [ cheering] Damn, we're good. Damn, we're good. <br/>My God! <br/>Jeff: Ogakor, congratulations. <br/>Tina: Whoo! <br/>Jeff: Nice work. <br/>Colby: Ow! <br/>Jeff: Guys, your reward, right here: waterproof matches. <br/>Jerri: Yeah! <br/>Amber: Yeah! <br/>Jeff: And much more important, I think, you're in  possession...  Amber: Wow...  Jeff: ...of the immunity idol. [ cheering]  We need to stay positive now, okay? <br/>Jeff: Guys, tomorrow, somebody from Kucha will be the  first person voted out of the tribe. You'll have that to think about tonight. I know you're already a close group. It's going to be a tough decision. You guys can head on back to camp. Ogakor, you guys can light this up in celebration. <br/>Rodger: Yesterday's immunity challenge was a big letdown,  uh, uh, not only physically, but emotionally. I think probably more so emotionally. As far as the Tribal Council goes tonight, which are... which we  have to go to, uh, I don't think any of us are looking forward to it. [ gagging] [ retching]  Jeff is not well. <br/>Elisabeth: You need to sit down. You're so shaky, you're scaring me. <br/>Jeff V.: That's okay. <br/>Debb: I don't know. I'm not betting on me getting voted off, but I think it's-it's  down to, like, me, Rodger or maybe, um... Jeff, because he hasn't been  feeling good. My personal opinion is the strong survive. If you were going to vote for someone, who would you be voting  for right now? <br/>Rodger: Jeff. <br/>Debb: Me, too. I really love the guy. <br/>Rodger: I like him. I like him. He's a good kid. <br/>Debb: But he's sick. He's sick. <br/>Jeff V.: Debb. She wants to go, too, by the way. <br/>Alicia: Really? <br/>Jeff V.: Yeah. <br/>Alicia: She told me that you wanted to go. She sure did. <br/>Jeff V.: What? <br/>Alicia: She told me that you wanted to go. <br/>Jeff V.: That is a bald-faced lie. <br/>Alicia: Okay, scandalous. She told me you wanted to go. <br/>Debb: I-I'm going to probably vote for Jeff. And I was talking with him today, you know, and he doesn't even  seem that upset at the thought of it. <br/>Rodger: Yeah. <br/>Debb: He's like... he wants a pizza and a coke. <br/>Rodger: He-he might've...  Alicia: She said, "He's falling apart, doesn't feel  good." I was like, "Yeah, okay."  Jeff V.: Are you kidding me? <br/>Alicia: No, I'm not kidding you. I wouldn't tell you that if she didn't say it. <br/>Jeff V.: It's like there's a part of me that's a little  paranoid about who's talking to who. I see these two standing over across, um... Mike and Rodger  standing across the river talking. They're not fishing. They're not doing anything. They're just talking, and uh, the wheels start turning, and  just... my eyes are going around. <br/>Michael: I mean, it's two different games, you know? <br/>Jeff V.: Just because we've said what we're doing doesn't  necessarily mean it's going to happen, and I haven't been with these people  long enough to know for sure how well... I mean, I'm not going to trust  anybody, but there's a certain... to a certain point, you have to. <br/>Jeff V.: I puked on camera. How embarrassing. <br/>Michael: You puked? <br/>Debb: Couple times already. <br/>Michael: Did you save it? <br/>Debb: Would you stop? [ laughing]  Kimmi: It's like going to court. Tribal Council is going to court. Nobody likes to go to court, you know, but if you broke the law,  you got to go, and we broke the law by not winning. So we, you know, we got to go face our punishment. Our punishment... is to get rid of one of our own. <br/>Michael: The people that I think that are in jeopardy  tonight are potentially Jeff, because of the health issues, and Rodger might  not be safe. He could be a liability in the challenges, and especially  swimming challenges and climbing challenges. And it's not just Rodger. It would be anybody over 50 years old. <br/>Jeff V.: I mean, I-I'm looking forward to voting somebody  out, 'cause it's the game, and I'm here to play the game. I'm not here to make friends. I'm not here for that. People have got to go, and I look forward to walking up, writing  somebody's name on a card and talking about 'em. [ laughs] Um... I'm getting ready to do it. <br/>Jeff: Guys, come on in. it. <br/>Jeff: Guys, come on in. We begin your first Tribal Council with a ritual. Behind each of you is a torch. Grab a torch and approach a flame. Dip your torches in and... get some fire, put 'em back in their  slots. We do this because fire does represent life here. These torches will now represent your life, your identity at  Tribal Council. You'll bring these torches with you to each Tribal Council, and  the good news is when you return home tonight, you will have fire. Before we get into this, I just want you guys to take a second  and look around at where we're at. We're on top of a granite waterfall. Can't think of a more spectacular place for the drama that's  going to go down here every three days. This is where you account for your actions. Some of those actions tonight are going to help you. Going to stay here a few more days. Some of those actions may come back to haunt you. One thing's for certain. One of you guys will be the first person voted out of a tribe. So before we get to that, let's do a little gauge in how the  first few days were. Debb, what about finding the camp? Was it a celebration or was it fall down, "I'm  exhausted"? <br/>Debb: Celebration. Celebration. It was celebration all the way in. Hop in the water and then regret it afterwards when we were  freezing and had no fire. <br/>Jeff: Yeah, let's talk a little about that. Fire. You've-you've been one really trying to get this fire going. Yeah, I been the one trying and getting no fire. I mean, I've tried everything those damn books said to do. The bow, the-the... this thing. That's crazy. <br/>Jeff: Well, you'll have fire tonight when you go home. <br/>Debb: Yeah, yeah. That's good to know. It's been a little cold a couple nights here. <br/>Jeff: Have you guys formed any impressions about the other  tribe in the limited time you've seen them? <br/>Michael: We haven't really had a lot of contact with them,  but, uh, right now, we totally see them as the enemy. We haven't had a chance to bond with them. We haven't had a chance to talk with them at all. I didn't even look at 'em when we lost. <br/>Nick: Yesterday's event was just a physical challenge, and  I would've put money on us any day to win that challenge, but they went  through, and then we had problems. <br/>Jeff: Rodger, leadership come up? Did anybody emerge as a leader? <br/>Rodger: Uh, yes. I would say probably, uh, Mike has. Uh, uh, as far as building the hut, I think we both probably  shared in on that, 'cause my knowledge on that is pretty extensive in-in that  I teach a carpentry class, and, uh... But overall, I'd say he's probably  taken the lead, and-and that's fine, 'cause he's a very knowledgeable person. We all... we all get along great. Tonight is, uh, really a hard deal for us. Uh, personally, I-I thought that the first vote off would be  easy, because you would probably have somebody that would be slacking, but we  just haven't had that. I mean, every one of these people have worked and worked hard,  and that's-that's what makes tonight's vote so hard. <br/>Jeff: All right, it's time to vote. Here's how it's going to work. One by one, you guys will go across the bridge to the voting  confessional. You'll write down in big clear letters the name of the person  you're voting for, hold it up, speak your peace-- why you're voting the way  you're voting-- then fold it up, put it in the voting container, come back  and have a seat. Make sense? We'll start here with you, Debb. You're up. <br/>Debb: I love this guy dearly, You're up. <br/>Debb: I love this guy dearly, but I came here deciding  that I was going to vote on the strongest surviving. Jeff's been the sickest of all of us, and he's still not over  it, so I'm going to vote for Jeff, and I hate to do it. I love him. <br/>Rodger: No real reason, actually. She's as hard a worker as anybody out there, and, uh... somebody  had to go. <br/>Kimmi: I'm voting for Debb somebody had to go. <br/>Kimmi: I'm voting for Debb because... she's a great worker  and everything, but she does feel isolated. You know, when we're together all in the tent at night, she just  chooses... to be independent, and... she's just a strong-willed person. It's not a bad thing. It's just not what I need. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. I need to remind you that once the votes are tallied, the  decision is final. The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. You'll do so across this bridge here. Take the bridge up, over the rocks, down to a confessional where  you can speak as long as you want about your time here in the Outback. I'll read the votes. First vote... Debb. Debb. Jeff. Debb. Four votes for Debb, one vote for Jeff. First person voted out of the tribe... is Debb. No point in revealing the other two votes. You need to bring your torch. <br/>Debb: Do good. Kick ...  Jeff: Over here, Debb. The tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. <br/>Kimmi: Good-bye, Debb. <br/>Jeff: You survived your first Tribal Council. Grab your torches. You'll have fire. Head back to camp, I'll see you tomorrow. Stay tuned for scenes from our I'll see you tomorrow. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. Next time on Survivor,Kel is accused of smuggling food. <br/>Mitchell: Jerri blatantly said that she saw something that  looked just like beef jerky. <br/>Kel: It was a blade of grass, and I was chewing on that. <br/>Jerri: It was nowhere near any grass. <br/>Jeff: Kimmi struggles with the immunity challenge. [ screams] You got cow brain there. <br/>Kimmi: I can't eat a brain. <br/>You're good. <br/>Debb: I wouldn't have minded getting voted off if I had  fell... fallen during a competition, if I was lazy, if I wasn't a team  player, but when I come here, and I give all of that, and I still get voted  off, I bet you if Jeff had read every one of those votes, it would have been  seven to one, and that's-that's a shame. I still thought a lot of it boiled down to mental toughness and  physical ability, and none of that even mattered.
