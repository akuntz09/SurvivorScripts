<br/>Jeff: "Survivor" is back. 18 strangers are about to begin an adventure that will forever  change their lives. They'll be abandoned and forced to work together while voting  each other out in the greatest social experiment on television. In the end, only one will remain to claim the $1 million prize. 39 days, 18 people, 1 Survivor! <br/>Jeff: Welcome to the 35th season of "Survivor."  [cheering and applause] for the first time you've been divided into three tribes  based on the positive traits most associated with you by others. This is how the world sees you. First group, you are the Hero tribe. [applause]  I'll take that. <br/>I'll take that. <br/>Jeff: You are heralded for your courage, your achieve. S, for your ideals for which you stand. Guy in the cowboy hat, what's your name? <br/>Ben. <br/>Jeff: Does this ring true to you? What is your world about? <br/>Well, I have a family, a wife and two kids. I was in the marine corps and served our country. <br/>Jeff: So being in the armed services, you have to have  heard the word Hero associated with you. <br/>Some people might say that. To us it's just us doing our job and fighting for our country. We'll go out and lay our lives on the line. <br/>Jeff: What else would we expect from someone else that  serves our country than to say, "It's just our job."  That's all it is, Jeff. <br/>I definitely think I belong  on the Hero tribe. <br/>I feel proud of having  had a career and then stopped and stayed home to take care of my kids and  then came back to an awesome career, but I need the really downplay that  because I don't want people to think, she already makes a lot of money, so we  don't want her to win a lot of money. <br/>Jeff: Okay. Next group, you are the Healer tribe. You receive gratitude for your acts of service helping others  relieve their physical pain or emotional pain. Guy in the middle, what's your name? <br/>Cole. <br/>Jeff: What do you do? <br/>We take teens into the outdoors and teach them lessons  like making fire and survival skills. The outdoors opened up my world. I want to open up other people's worlds with the same thing that  made mine so amazing. <br/>Jeff: Guy here in the front with the glasses, what's your  name? <br/>Mike. <br/>Jeff: What do you do? <br/>I’m a sex doctor. I'm a urologist and I specialize in sexual dysfunction and male  infertility. <br/>Jeff: You receive a lot of gratitude from guys all the  time in  Most guys are pretty happy when they're through with me. Winning "Survivor" is the biggest dream in my life. My wife thinks I’m crazy for doing this, my kids think I’m going  to die, but I’m going to rise to the occasion and win. <br/>Jeff: All right. That brings us to our last group. You are the Hustler tribe. You are respected for your hard work ethic. Your mantra is get it done no matter what, 100% all the time. Woman in the middle, what's your name? <br/>Ali. <br/>Jeff: What do you do? <br/>I’m a personal assistant. I work for someone at youtube, daily disk duties. Sometimes I do her make-up if she doesn't have make-up artist. I cook for her if she doesn't have a cook. I fill in the gaps. I wake up that day and find out what I have to do, and I do it. <br/>Drew: Being part of a group that's respected for work  ethics rings very true to you? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Just looking at our tribe, I think it's a strong group. I hope they're macho enough and they know how the build a  shelter and crack a conut. I'm going to defer to them. I'm 125 pounds soaking wet. I don't drink and I don't have a girlfriend. Who wants to Align with me? <br/>Jeff: All right. We have three good groups. This season is called "Survivor: Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers." let me give you your buffs. <br/>It's like christmas. <br/>Blue. <br/>Jeff: This is your first opportunity to prove your value  to your tribe. This boat is loaded with supplies. Your job is to get as many of the supplies from this boat to  your boat. In addition, there's an even bigger reward at stake. On the beach, each tribe has a burning urn 15 feet high. When you hear mehring this bell, that's your cue to get all six  tribe members on the boat and start paddling to shore. When you get to shore, you must lift one person high enough to  light their torch. First tribe to get fire wins fire in the form of a massive  fire-making kit that will be waiting for you back at camp. [applause] second tribe to finish, not as pretty but gets the  job done, flint. With this you can make fire. The last tribe to finish, otherwise known as the losers, will go  back to camp with no fire. This is day one of a 39-day, $1 million adventure, and it begins  now. "Survivor" is on. Let's go! <br/>Who can swim, who can swim? <br/>I can. <br/>Let's do this! <br/> Jeff: This is it. This is the moment you've been waiting for, and it's happening  right now. <br/>Go! <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Out of the gate it is chaos. People already going overboard with lots of supplies left on the  boat. So far there is no plan at all. <br/>Let's go, guys. <br/>Jeff: Wow, people launching stuff, Patrick launching fruit  like a quarterback with no receiver. <br/>Let's go, let's go. <br/>Jeff: 30 seconds. Remember, when I hit that bell, you can head out. <br/>Let's go, guys. <br/>I see something labeled  secret advantage. I am super excited. My hands are trembling. I was like, whoo. <br/>Jeff: Lots of fruit in the water. Now it becomes getting it to your boat. <br/>A little bit more. <br/>Jeff: Everybody over. You have to get out of here now. Let's go, dude. Get over! That means now. Get in your boat and start heading to the beach. <br/>Get in, get in. <br/>Jeff: Now it's first to get fire. <br/>Let's hit it. <br/>Go! <br/>Jeff: The Hustler tribe is struggling to even get in their  boat. Healers really working together well. Heroes right on their tail. And the Hustler tribe pointing the wrong way. They're heading to a different beach. <br/>Which way are we going, guys? <br/>Spin it right. <br/>Let's go, let's go. <br/>Jeff: Healers going to get to the beach first. Then the Heroes with the Hustlers literally lost at sea. <br/>Come on, come on. Someone jump out and help me. <br/>Jeff: Healers get here first. You got to hook that boat. Here comes the Hero tribe. <br/>Let's go, guys. Come on. <br/>Drew: We are neck and neck right now. Both tribes very even. You're good. Start untying your torch. You're good, Hero tribe. Start untying your torch. <br/>Come on. <br/>Jeff: Okay. Paul has the torch for the Healer tribe. <br/>You're the lightest. You're the lightest. <br/>No way. <br/>Jeff: You got to get somebody high enough to get that  fire. <br/>You hold the torch, you hold the torch. <br/>Jeff: This is going to come down to a very close finish. Healers there. Healers close. Yes! You got it. Healers get fire fire in a massive fire reward. Heroes have it. It is Healers and Heroes with the Hustlers still trying to  figure out what show they're on. All right. Healer tribe, you will have waiting for you at camp a massive  fire-making kit, and you will know you're at your beach when you see the fire  already burning. Nice job. [applause] Hero tribe, flint, you can make fire with this. All right. Each tribe has a map in your boat. Get in your boat, start paddling and good luck. <br/>Coming from that horrible competition, I was just pretty  pissed. I'm hoping that our work ethic and our strength alone can push  us to come together and get it done, but at this point I’m very nervous. <br/>As we row in, we see the biggest fire any of us have ever  seen. And it sets us off on the right foot. <br/>I’m so proud of us. <br/>I know. Way to go, team. <br/>Healers are definitely a team-based group in terms of how  we approach our careers, in terms of how we approach our lives, and I think  that's a really distinct difference between us and the other two. <br/>I’m literally with the  three females. There's a group strength, right? And you, you got the eight pack. <br/>Cole is tarzan, I like him a lot. He's fun. He's trying not to be the tough guy, but he is. I mean, he's ripped. He has beautiful, tan skin, blonde hair, blue eyes. I think I’m in love. <br/>I’m so glad we have this  tribe. Even if we have an off day, we're still safe. <br/>I just don't see it. It's all about communication. It's about communication. That's what we do for a living. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I wanted to be in the  tribe they could easily manipulate, and I feel that when you're a Healer, you  have a big heart, and when you have a big heart, you don't think with your  mind, you think with your heart. I'm a Healer in the fact that my main job is rehabilitation, but  I’m not a from base officer when I’m out here. I came out here to win. I'm probably more strategic than everyone altogether. So they're all my victims at this point. <br/>Whew. <br/>Big piece on the bottom, little piece on top. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Yeah? <br/>Now we're happening. <br/>Need help with that? The qualities of being a Hero are going to help in "Survivor,"  because the whole idea of being a Hero, you're putting others before yourself,  which makes for a really strong tribe. What about firewood? But game on. The Hero cape falls off and automatically you're thinking  alliances, conversations need to happen. So it will definitely start to get interesting. <br/>What are you thinking? <br/>I like cowboy. <br/>What's up? <br/>I like cowboy? <br/>Yeah, me, you, cowboy? That's pretty good? <br/>He's smart and useful. <br/>I think we can make that  work. <br/>I played in the n.F.L. For nine years, and after you play for a while, you can see who  is a tempo setter. Just now, I got a sense of how people are playing the game. <br/>We're going to need a lot more. <br/>I’m definitely going to  play the game, which for me is full tilt sprint out the gate. Who are you thinking of working with? We need to win challenges. We need strength. <br/>Absolutely. We have to win. <br/>We need strength. J.T. Is an asset. You and Ashley, that's four right there. We're going to explode on that. <br/>Okay. <br/>I work with so many  firefighters and soon-to-be firefighters. You remind me so much of all of them. <br/>Oh, yeah? <br/>They must be pretty cool guys. <br/>They're all my best friends. <br/>I've been watching those two for a while. I honestly think Ashley and JPM. Are working together, so I want the make them believe I'll work  with them, but this power couple or whatever they got going on is over. <br/>They're going to go get water. <br/>Nice. <br/>Hey, y'all, four, right? <br/>Yeah. Yeah. <br/>I wanted us four from the  beginning. <br/>Right now we're looking at a core four, and that's me, Alan,  Ashley, and JP We're all younger, we're fit, and then we got the two moms, Chrissy  and Katrina. <br/>The whole young crowd. <br/>It is. <br/>If you and I don't work together at some level...  No, no, we have to. <br/>We've labeled them the mom squad. That's an easy target at this point. <br/>Keep it strong. That's it. We're done. Winning is the most important thing right now for this tribe. <br/>We're going to be fine. <br/>When it comes down to it, we have each other's backs. <br/>Can I make a suggestion? <br/>Yeah. <br/>We need to be over here, away from this over here,  because, you know, there's critters and spiders and snakes. I'm just disappointed we didn't win the challenge, but at the  same time, let's not give up. <br/>Get it in there, baby. <br/>Being Hustler, we're hard workers, so we kind of kick it  in gear. I like it. <br/>This is what we need to do the rest of this game. Really if we play as a team, we'll be fine. If not we're going to be screwed. <br/>That's a walking stick. <br/>Should I eat it? <br/>No. <br/>You don't think so? <br/>No. <br/>My priorities for day one are to make sure that I connect  with people, and Patrick seems like he's meshing well with the group just  from the very beginning, so I kind of want the see where his head is at. <br/>I forgot I have a crab in  my pants. <br/>I know if we never lose,  we don't have to worry about an alliance, but the way we looked in the first  challenge, we should probably start talking now. How do you feel about it? <br/>I feel we have a good  team. We've got to win first tribal, though. Definitely want to make a game plan. <br/>You at least have to have the mind set, but I got your  back if you got mine. <br/>I got your back. Ali, she's a very smart girl. On an island where we can trust no one, I feel I can trust her,  but it's "Survivor," so you can't know for sure. I feel good, but I’m not certain. <br/>Now I’m wondering who got the clue on the boat. <br/>You think someone found something? <br/>If not, somebody overlooked it. It was on there. <br/>I found an advantage on  the boat. Nobody knows about it. It's in my pants. I'm dying to know what it is. For the first time someone is dying to get in my pants. I kind of just wait for the perfect moment to get away. I go into the jungle by myself. I am super excited. I have never had an advantage in my entire life. I'm a Hustler. Hustlers don't get advantages, and the Hustler got an advantage. <br/>You have found an immunity superidol. It can be played after the votes have been read and will save  whoever you play it for. Oh, my God. This could be my power to win this game. I have a super immunity idol. That could be used after the votes have been read. That gives you so much power. A twist. It's only good at the first tribal council. If your tribe wins immunity, that means you will not go to the  first tribal council. You must send somebody to the losing tribe. The recipient will not know who sent it. <br/>If we pull out a win, I have to give it to a member of the  losing tribe that goes to tribal. That means that I have the most power right now in this game,  and nobody else has any clue whatsoever. <br/>Okay. I'm ready for marching orders. <br/>Lest gather some more bamboo so we have everything here. <br/>That sounds good. The shelter will go over here I think. <br/>I’m fortunate to be part  of the Healer tribe. We're in high spirits. We know that first and foremost we can communicate, and as long  as we do that in camp life, everything runs smoothly. Holy crap, nice. <br/>I know. <br/>My son told me to look for the idol. He's ten years old, and he watches Survivor. If my ten-year-old son knows to look for the idol, I should go  looking for it, and so should everybody else. <br/>I think the only concern  is being this close to mosquitoes. <br/>Should we check the fire? <br/>I'll go check it. <br/>My biggest fear going into thi game is being voted out first. I left my kids and my wife behind to play this crazy game, but I  did not come out here for an adventure. I am out here to win $1 million and be the best "Survivor"  player ever. So I am willing to do what it takes to win this game. <br/>Nice. <br/>When Mike comes back, I’m going to ask him to draw us map  of the island, because he knows it like the back of his hand, like legit. He knows everything. <br/>Mike is definitely a player, and I’m a tad bit concerned  that he's running around trying to find the idol. So I think he wanted to look for the idol. Now he's probably going to be no m. <br/>He's getting firewood. <br/>I have a great lie  detector, and I’m thinking Mike is not a trustworthy guy. <br/>We undid the bad with the bandannas on the other side,  too. <br/>Mike's suspect running around this island. I personally think he has the idol. <br/>I wish I did, that would  be awesome. <br/>So you looked through this whole island and you didn't  find nothing? <br/>I haven't looked through  the whole island yet. <br/>We both watch the game. <br/>I’m honored that you  think I’m a Hustler. <br/>No, no, no, the thing is I respect you enough to come see  you individually right or wrong. <br/>That's nice. <br/>I respect that. Hopefully you respect me, as well, that's all I’m saying. <br/>I do respect you. I don't trust Joe for one second. He's pulled me aside to have a man-to-man talk with me to  essentially bully me into telling him that I went looking for the immunity  idol. <br/>I wanted you to be aware  that we are all aware. That's what I’m saying. <br/>But at the same time it puts me at risk. Perception is 90% of reality, unfortunately. And with that you don't want to be having to fight perceptions. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>This is so light right now. I don't know who got all the weight, but it's not me. <br/>I feel like it's me. <br/>Three, two, one, drop... Good work. These first impressions are crucial, and I really like having Devon  in this group because he's different than me. <br/>Devon, what do you do again? <br/>Teach kids how to surf. I don't make a lot, but it pays my rent. <br/>He seems like a guy who is looking for someone who is more  strategically sound. So I’m waiting for the perfect moment when everybody is cleared  out of camp so I can build a connection. So I found an advantage yesterday. <br/>You did? <br/>On the boat, yeah. Only for the first tribal. I have the idol that could be played after the votes. Yeah. And that's it. And if we don't go to tribal, I have to give it to somebody else  on their tribe. <br/>Okay. I'm so happy, dude. Dude, I was so scared to be first one. <br/>You're not going to be first one. <br/>No, no. <br/>Ryan tells me about this special immunity idol and said he  will be willing to use the idol for me. Ryan and I have the same mindset, same ideas, our chemistry is  perfect. We're going to cause chaos together. <br/>I haven't told anyone  else and I’m not. <br/>Keep it, keep it. <br/>That's how much I trust you. <br/>Cool. <br/>She was about to hit me. Did you see that? <br/>I did. If you were closer I would have hit you you were just too far  away. <br/>It's not first time? <br/>First time what, for us to fight? <br/>I know there's something  going on between JP And Ashley. It's red flags all over the place between those two. I need to let everybody know those two are stronger together  right now than question are all as individuals. <br/>Yo, you got the idol. It's cool if he got it. <br/>I don't have the idol,  100%. <br/>How far are you willing to go to move -- to prove that? Let's go to the swim. Let's go to the water's edge right now. <br/>I swear on my mom's  grave. <br/>I don't want to do that. <br/>Man's handshake. <br/>I don't need that. Just put your hands up. <br/>I swear the God. <br/>I know where the idol is  right now. I know where it's at right now. I just kind of know what's going on. <br/>Trust me, I promise. <br/>What did you just say, I know what's going on? <br/>Are we four strong or not? <br/>I thought so. You are tripping like you're tripping, tripping. <br/>I don't know if they have  an idol. I didn't actually see anything. I just threw it out there. I know I look like the crazy man, but now I got suspicion going,  and I just put target on their back if it worked the way it's supposed to  work. <br/>You're insinuating that there's something going on that  you don't know about, and there's not. <br/>Nothing going on that I don't know about? <br/>No. <br/>Will is no idol? <br/>There is no idol. <br/>Alan is a crazy man. He gets this crazy look in his eye and it's his drama and  everything he causes is I think maybe not worth his strength. Just a loose cannon like that rocks the ship. <br/>Are we four strong? <br/>Yes. <br/>Dude, you're tripping hard right now. <br/>I know, I know, because  it looks like I’m tripping, right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>So the idol in your pants I’m tripping about? <br/>If he has an idol, I know nothing about it. <br/>Don't turn around, why are you turning around? I know you got the idol, my man? Where is it at? <br/>Alan is starting to lose his mind. He made JP Strip to check his pants for an idol, so my mind is literally  blown right now. His paranoia is so bad, like where is this coming from all of a  sudden, because I trusted him and I thought he trusted me, but just like  that, trust is tournament window. So moving forward with him seems like it could be a liability  down the road. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. You guys ready to get to your first immunity challenge? [applause]  Yeah. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, you're going the race up a  cargo net to the top of a tower. You'll then pull a heavy cart up, hop in, and careen down to the  bottom where you will find a choice of three "Survivor" table  mazes. The first tribe here gets first choice. Second tribe to arrive gets to choose between the remaining two. The last tribe gets what's left. You'll then work together to get that maze to the top of an even  taller tower, where two players will maneuver three balls through the maze. First two tribes to finish win immunity. These are the immunity idols. This is what you want. With one of these in your possession, you are safe in this game. Losers, tribal council where somebody will be the first person  voted out. In addition, Hustlers, you are still playing for fire in the  form of flint. One more thing, at tribal council this season, tie votes are  back in. Give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. Let's do it. All right. Here we go. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! You got to get up that cargo net. Attack it. Heroes first on their part, then the Healers, then the Hustlers. Those carts are heavy. This is where adrenaline is your friend. It gives you strength you didn't know you had. Healers get to the top first, then the Heroes, then the Hustlers. Once you're in, release it. <br/>Go, go. <br/>Jeff: Hustlers get out first, then the Hero, then the Healers. That is how you do it. <br/>Come on, come on, everybody. <br/>Jeff: Heroes here first. You have first choice. What do you want? They choose three. Hustlers have a choice between the remaining. Two they choose one. Healers left with number two. Next phase is getting to the top now. Heroes out of the gate first. <br/>You got it. <br/>Jeff: Now you got to get two people to the top. <br/>Go up top. <br/>Jeff: Alan going up, Ashley going up for the Heroes. It is Cole and Joe for the Healers. It is Lauren and Ryan, a surprising choice to be pulling for the  Hustlers. This sled is heavy. It's going to take a lot of teamwork. Joe taking a long time to even get to the top. They can't start pulling until he gets there. <br/>Three, two, one! Three, two, one! Three, two, one! <br/>Jeff: Cole and Joe going to pull for the Healers. <br/>Watch out. Watch your leg. <br/>Jeff: The Healers working to make up some time. <br/>Guide us in, guide us in. <br/>Jeff: Hustlers get up first. Heros have theirs. Healers now have theirs. You got to lock in your handles now. It is Chrissy and Ben for the Heroes in a traditional phase, Devon  and Ali for the Hustlers on the obstacle maze. Mike and Desi for the Healers. This is where adrenaline works against you because you brain is  playing, please slow down so I can think. There is definitely a learning curve, like most "Survivor"  challenges. You've got to figure it out. <br/>When there is a bar on the right. Lean a little right. <br/>Good. <br/>That's it. <br/>Now lean a little left. Yes, yes! <br/>Jeff: Healers with a nice touch. And they have it. The Healers have their first ball. <br/>Great job, you guys. You have this now. <br/>Jeff: Now the Heroes and Hustlers are feeling that  pressure. Nice move by the Heroes. They're figuring it out. Hustlers getting close. <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: Hustlers have their first point. It is now Healers with one, Hustlers with one, Heroes yet to get  on the board. Heros have their first ball. Moving on to their second. We are tied now 1-1. Healers are through. They're close to their second if they can save it. They have the second ball for the Healers. Hustlers very close to landing their second ball. Heroes are once again very close. Heroes in and out. Heroes have their second. And the Hustlers drop right behind them. It is 2-2-2. Healers very close. <br/>Steady, Mike. <br/>Jeff: Dr. Mike and Desi trying to'd that in for the win. Healers win first immunity. They are safe from tribal council. <br/>Jeff, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: We're looking for one more. <br/>Slow, slow. <br/>Jeff: Hustlers are around their difficult spot. They are very close to closing this out. This is the big move right here for the Hero tribe. Toughest spot on their maze. Chrissy and Ben with a nation move and they're through. <br/>Too far back, too far back. <br/>Jeff: There is a showdown. Who can get that third ball to drop first? Heros in and out. <br/>Slow. <br/>Jeff: Both tribes maneuvering that ball to get it to drop. Hustlers win immunity, sending the Hero tribe to tribal council. <br/>Good job. <br/>We have to work together. <br/>Oh, my God, yes! Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Healer tribe, congratulations. Impressive start, two wins in a row. Nobody going home from your tribe. Hustlers, nobody going home from your tribe, as well. In addition, fire in the form of flint. Good luck with that. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, are you all right? Chrissy, do you need a hand? Do you want medical or do you want your tribe to help? <br/>I just...  Jeff: That's it. Let it out. We have medical here if you need it, Chrissy. <br/>You'll be all right. <br/>You can't say that we didn't give our all. <br/>We did our best. <br/>We're going the make lemonade out of lemons. <br/>Jeff: This is what "Survivor" is all acted. You rely on each other, and the complication is you have to get  rid of each other. Somebody going home tonight, first person voted out of "Survivor:  Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers." grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>Okay. I'm good. <br/>I found this super  immunity idol. It is only good for the first tribal council. So I now have to give toilet a member of that losing tribe. I can give this to someone who is in the minority and save them  tonight, and they can take out someone who may be a threat and change the  game. <br/>Before last night this vote was easy. <br/>I love our tribe the way  it is. It's too bad it has to change, huh? <br/>Yeah. <br/>This is not how it was supposed to start. <br/>Alan created basically a spectacle out of nothing. <br/>Go get some water? <br/>Go get firewood. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Do you want me to come? <br/>Yeah. <br/>In less than 12 hours, everything went from 100% we're  safe, solid four, to there really is no trust. <br/>All right. Katrina, we all good? <br/>I’m good. <br/>For tonight? <br/>Ash? <br/>Easy, right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>You? <br/>I’m good. <br/>Let's keep it simple. <br/>Ashley and JP Think that I’m still in the core four with them, but I don't  trust Ashley and JP Further than I can throw them. They might be like, Alan got to go. So whatever they trying to do, I’m blowing it up. <br/>What are you thinking? <br/>Ain't nobody been talking to me about game? <br/>Nobody has. <br/>We got to work together. <br/>We still got only two votes. <br/>We could go with Chrissy and ben? <br/>Chrissy? Come here. <br/>What do you want to do? <br/>This is what I’m thinking? I nobody has talked game with me. She's saying no one has talked game with her either. So that's two. <br/>So you think it's you and you think it's you, because I think  it's me? <br/>Yeah, yeah. I do think the three of us plus Ben can make a strong four. <br/>I don't feel safe. I don't have a good alliance on the team. I knew I need to get people to vote together. We need four people to vote for somebody. <br/>We're have a quick powwow. We're trying to figure out a plan. <br/>Ashley and j.F.K. Talk. They probably have a plan. <br/>If that was the case, who right now? <br/>Ashley. <br/>Right now I think I have plan with Chrissy, Alan, and ben. I have to put faith in three people I’m not sure totally have my  back. Hopefully it works. <br/>I’m with you. It keeps us strong. <br/>I just know Ashley, she's  a wild card. <br/>We're still keeping our eyes open. <br/>If everyone would have stucked to the plan and calm down  and talked it out, we'd be fine. But here we are, day three, and we've all just blown up. <br/>I feel good with the  plan. <br/>Good plan. <br/>Yep. At tribal council tonight, there's two ways Alan and I can go. We can go with the mom squad and go straight for Ashley, or we  can go with JP And Ashley and get Chrissy or Katrina out. I'm a little worried about Ashley and JP Having something going on, but as a tribe, we have to stay  strong, and the two older women are probably the weakest links in our tribe. Whether or not you go with strength or loyalty, in the long run  it's about Alan and I, who we trust most. We're getting low on time, y'all. <br/>I was getting ready for  tribal. I looked in my bag. I see a package. I have no idea what it is. <br/>Oh, my gosh. Someone has secretly chosen you to receive immense power early  in the game. Oh, my gosh. This is an immunity super idol. This idol can be played after the votes have been read, but it  can only be used at tonight's tribal council. Wow. How lucky did I get? I got the super immunity idol, and it feels incredible. I think the decision of what I do with this super idol is  extremely important, especially since half the tribe is potentially on the  chopping block, Katrina, me, Ashley, Alan, we don't know. Clearly if it's me on the block, I’m using it to save myself. I just want to see what plays out, and I’m going to let the  discussion at tribal council dictate whether I play it and for whom. <br/>Jeff: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch. Dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual of tribal council, because fire  represents life. And when your fire is gone, so are you. Sadly, that will be the case for somebody. Ben, are you feeling, man, the game really does move this fast? <br/>It's exciting. It's scary. <br/>Jeff: But? <br/>But that's the game we all came to play. So...  Jeff: Chrissy, what was the vibe those first few moments  when you hit the beach? <br/>Immediately I felt that I did not belong with this group. <br/>Jeff: Really? <br/>Yeah, I honestly felt that the four major physical threats  would probably get together. <br/>Jeff: And who is that? <br/>Ashley, JP, Alan, and ben. <br/>Jeff: Katrina, did you have the same feeling? <br/>Yeah, being older than a lot of these other people here,  they might look to us to be voted out first service somebody else. <br/>Jeff: Ashley, one of the unique things about this game is  you find yourself with people that you might not ever even meet otherwise. The people out here will tell you exactly what they think, true  or not, we never know. <br/>Right. There's a lot that you never know in this game. You kind of figure that out. <br/>Jeff: How so? <br/>Day two and a half there was already a little commotion  going on. Alan pulls JP And me and says, we have an idol. No clue where that came from. <br/>Either an idol or a clue. <br/>I’m not going to back  down from saying that. <br/>Jeff, we tried our best to convince him that what he  thinks he saw is not true. <br/>But that's not going to change my mind, you deny, deny,  deny, deny. <br/>He had JP Strip all his clothes to check for a non-existent idol. <br/>Jeff: So JP, you're wrapped up in this, as well. <br/>I guess a little bit. <br/>Jeff: A little bit? You took your clothes off to prove you don't have an idol. <br/>It's part of the game. Everybody is welcome to their opinions. You can only do so much. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, one thing about Survivor is the minute you  get linked with somebody else, now you're seen as two votes. <br/>Yeah. And that really is what happened in this situation. People are concerned that we had a power couple. To have the term power couple even thrown around is ridiculous  to me. There is no me and JP There has been no conversation other than right in front of you. <br/>Think thing was to let the tribe know that there's  something stronger in the tribe than the tribe, whether these folks believe  what I believe, I know what I know. I'm not crazy. I'm confident. <br/>You're going to feel very silly. <br/>If I go home tonight because I’m silly, so be it. But I don't think we need to bicker and banter about. This we are labeled the Heroes. We need to have the mentality that we can do what we planned and  make our team strong and then we'll hash out whatever we need the hash out  later. <br/>Jeff: Alan, that sounds like Ben has another plan that  he's trying to make sure that's what's happening. <br/>Definitely. I could have afforded to sit back with my feet up and be  comfortable. I could have. Because everybody has had the talk about getting rid of Katrina. Everybody is throwing out names to get rid of Chrissy. But that's the risk I had to take to let people know exactly  what's going on. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, Alan said, I'll tell you what the early  talk was, the two older women. <br/>That feels terrible, of course. I think that would be unwise. I think that voting me off is losing my skills. <br/>Jeff, I think there's a point where everybody is at the  chopping block at some point and we have to do what we can do to connect with  people, because if we can all stay more honest about what's really happening,  we'll get further in the tribe than pretending these things don't exist. <br/>Jeff, I have no clue what's going to happen tonight. We had a plan, but it's up in the air. We're going to have to do some damage control one way or the  other. Period. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Katrina, you're up. Katrina, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote Katrina. Ashley. Katrina. That's two votes Katrina. Katrina. Three votes Katrina. One vote Ashley. First person voted out of "Survivor: Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers," Katrina. That's four. S that enough. You need to bring me your torch. Katrina, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Good luck, guys. Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. <br/>Jeff: Well, while the vote was united, this tribe is  clearly not. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Captioned by media access group at wgbh
