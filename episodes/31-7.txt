<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," welcome to "Survivor: Second  chance." 16 days ago 20 former players started their second chance to  play the game they love.  I need to go through this again.  I'm back for some redemption.  Jeff: They all came with baggage from their past.  I feel exactly like I felt last time, out of place on a tribe, a fish out of  water once again.  Jeff: Some even have a history with each other.  You have zero chance of winning the game. Kass and I have feuded and we've  hated each other.  Jeff: And with redemption on the line, it was clear the game would be played  hard and fast.  When the merge come, all hell breaks loose.  Jeff: The Bayon tribe agreed to stay strong.  We have the stronger group. We have to stick together and have each other's  backs.  Jeff: But after a twist in theãi game -- we are switching from two tribes to three  tribes.  Shut the front door.  Jeff: The former Bayon were forced to make new deals.  I'm trying to pull in as many people as I can.  Jeff: Everyone was shocked when Terry left the game. Your son is in the  hospital. But they were even more surprised by a second switch. Two tribes  will be Ta Keo and Bayon.  I'm excited. I just want to win.  Jeff: The new Bayon came out the stronger tribe.  Oh, hell, yeah.  Jeff: And they won the last immunity idol. Bayon wins immunity. At the new Ta  Keo, Spencer was the odd man out. But Spencer and Kass put aside their past  differences.  No one will expect us to do anything. I didn't want to play with Spencer, but  can I use Spencer right now?  Jeff: And at tribal council, Kass saved Spencer, blaine siding Woo and  shocking Wiglesworth and Savage. The tribe has spoken. 13 are left. Who will  be voted out tonight?  One of the great things about second chance, there are so many layers of  relationship.  Yeah.  Even though you say you're going to start fresh, you get on a tribe with  someone who maybe betrayed you in the past.  A very tough night for me. I go to tribal. I thought it was a lock. They  didn't include me. And they're incredible liars. I thought I could read  people pretty well. They're professional. These folks are professional. I hope  you believe me that had you come to me, I would have just said, forget it.  It was nothing personal against anyone. It was just pure red flag.  Yeah.  I feel the most betrayed by Kass. I thought she wasn't really strong with the  Bayon, but after last night she became a Ta Keo. And I’m not going to go down  without a fight. I’m a big-hearted guy and I am loyal, and I had you guys'  backs from day one. My only pitch is take me to the merge and use me, use me  down the road. There's a merge coming. If I have to bite my tongue, act like  a wimpy little non-leader, under the radar screen kind of guy, which is the  antithesis of me, i'll do it. I need to get to ma merge.  I think we're all on the same page. We want to win. Do I have your word you  don't want to go after me again in.  I will never write your name down again. I swear.  Okay. Okay.  Savage is feeling foolish and he's feeling guilty because he got caught red  handed trying to blindside me, but I’m going to have to make peace because I’m  actually making relationships this time that have saved me. It took 17 days,  but finally I have a group.  This is maybe the start of what should have happened.  This is a second chance.  It is.  Kass and I went against each other a lot in the past, but this time I have to  rely on Kass. I truly have changed and progressed in this game, and that's  why I’m here today.  Here ye, here ye.  In bamboo, no nothing, just one page, short and sweet.  Bayon tribe, that's us, head down toward the end of your beach and await  visitors.  What?  No way.  This is a merge?  I'm a fan of "Survivor." this early couldn't be a merge. It's  usually nine or ten people.  They're not coming to this rat hole.  If it is a merge situation, my brain is spent. I'd be back with Kass and Spencer.  We have some bagage, too, so I’m really nervous.  Ta Keo tribe, gather everything at your camp that you will want to continue  this adventure and follow this map to your new home.  Does this mean a merge? I’m really nervous with Savage, who is disappointed  that we lied to him, it makes mer nervous to take somebody like that to the  merge.  What do you think is going on?  I don't know. We need to stick together. And remember, someone over there  will be on the bottom.  Find the crack.  Find the crack.  A beautiful merge. My dream to make the merge. I suffered. I am praying to a  "Survivor" God stronger that you can imagine that today is  something really good like a merge an I’m back with my Bayon brothers.  Yeah.  Yes.  We head over the hill, and all of a sudden I look out and I see this little  tribe of the Ta Keo. I’m thinking 13, there's no way it can be a merge.  That's such a big number.  You all ready?  All right. Keith, congratulations. You have merged.  Everyone's excited, but we're like, uh-oh, there's a lot of people here.  You better get moving. Once you make the merge, you know things are about to  change.  Welcome back, brother.  We made the merge.  Whole new game. Game on. Day one again. It's dangerous. But it's fun.  The 13 best losers ever.  All right. Should we start opening stuff in let's open things.  I'm so excited. I’m just freaking out inside. I didn't make the merge last  time, which was my goal number one, so to at least make the merge this time,  i've hit one step of where I wanted to be. But, you know, I want to push  through, and I want to get to the end. There's one winner. One person gets $1  million at the end of "Survivor." I came here to play. Were you  shocked?  We were very shocked?  Who did you vote for?  Spencer. So did wiggles and Savage, all voted for Spencer.  So you put his name down in.  No.  Wow? I worked with him.  In a bizarre twist, Spencer left his fate in my hands, and I did not abuse  it.  Chaos Kass, my savior.  Last night I pretty much decided to save Spencer, and I feel like Spencer  really trusts me because of supporting him and not lying to him. So I can  play that card with Spencer. I’m the one who saved him.  I'm officially in a food coma.  The cheese is starting to weigh me down.  I was just sitting there ready to pounce because everyone knew that as soon  as that feast broke up, it was going to be chaos. You have to hit the ground  running in "Survivor." you need to make an alliance of seven to get  the majority for the first vote.  Like the good old days.  I am the happiest man alive right now. Back at my home, my original home, Bayon.   It scares me, what happened last night, you can in the believe how fast they  are. It could have been me. This is going to go down really fast. Right now  they could have six of them coming against you or me, and we wouldn't even  know it. It's all about Bayon versus Ta Keo.  Yes.  We need our seven.  We need Tasha.  What about Fishbach.  Fishbach is down. Kimmi is down. We could pull in Wiglesworth.  We have Wiglesworth. Wiglesworth has told me she has my back. She wasn't in  the original Bayon, but Wiglesworth is hugely loyal from what I can tell. We  need seven. So from a numbers standpoint, I have to do everything I can to go  after Joe to just reconfirm that he would like to be part of the Bayon. What  we form will lay the foundation for the next two weeks.  Yes, yes.  It's all good, right?  Yes.  Jeremy and Savage and those guys are definitely together. Who else can we  pull, Abi?  She can't win.  Who else? We need one more.  We have hunter for sure right now.  Good.  Which is weird.  We pull in Abi and Spencer, that's seven. That's good.  Right now I am working with Kass, Ciera, Keith and hopefully we have Joe,  because when I was back at the old Ta Keo camp, we had made aã±r final five  deal.  We're good then.  Kass thinks we have Abi, but then I have Spencer and Joe, who are a little  bit of a wild card. Like I do want to talk to them to see exactly where they  are, because I need to make sure, like if they're on board. It's very clear  right now Spencer and Joe, they're going to be power players who are in  control of this game. This is it. It's so important.  I was doing the numbers last night, and it made me realize it's critical that  I reconnect with Joe face to face and just confirm how strong our bond is  because we need him. My pitch today is we can do this. Just stick together.  We got the numbers. It's really, really simple. Here's the thing, we have our  Bayon, and I think we can make it.  Everyone's in. Let me tell you who is on the list and you tell me. We have us  two, we have Jeremy, tash, yeah we have Kimmi, Stephen, and we have Wiglesworth.  We have Bayon. I'll tell you, honestly, we get to day 30, then we'll figure  it out.  Savage is really playing this game with his heart and he's really wearing it  on his sleeve, and I think that I can trust him, but I had a plan back with Ta  Keo, so I’m not limiting my options in this game. I’m just going to talk to  everybody today, feel everybody out.  You have a concerned look on your face.  I'm just like a little overwhelmed trying to figure out everything that's  happening.  I haven't seen Spencer in a long time. I want to check in with him to make  sure he wants to work with me.  Who do you want the play with right now?  Looking at the two groups, I trust Kass, Ciera, you, Abi. I trust that group  more than Tasha. Does that make sense?  The only two I’m not sure of because I haven't talked to are Joe and Keith.  Keith is 100%. I can promise you that.  You think?  Absolutely. I know him.  That's huge. And Joe?  I need to have a conversation with him to feel him out and make sure he's not  going to flip.  Right now there are two warring groups. Apparently Joe and I are smack dab in  the middle. Joe is a guy I wouldn't mind sticking with and swinging with in  that perhaps I could even make a move with down the road. I don't have any  allies for more than a day.  Which sucks.  I haven't had to go to tribal, so I haven't had to test my trust with people  yet, so I don't know where everyone stands. I think there's definitely a Bayon  group, like Jeremy...  Jeremy, tash, Stephen.  Joe and I were talking through who is aligned with who. So I tried to put  things in Joe language and say, all right, Joe, it's like a football play, we  have the lines in the sand, and there's this person and this person and this  person. I think there's five you can count on here and I think there's five  you can count on here.  We're kind of like in the middle.  At this point there's a line and I’m either over here or over here.  We have to wash each other's backs.  Yep.  I feel like I’m grounded. It's rainy day and I’m having to sit in my  grandma's sewing room.  I have a poem to share with you all. God's grandeur. "the world is  charged with the gann jury of God. It will flame out. It gathers to greatness  like oil crushed. Why do men then now not wreck the rod. And through all this  nature is never spent. There are those that deep down think. Because the holy  ghost over the bent breast."  nice.  You should do that every day for us.  Fishbach.  I feel there is a bro-down going on in Bayon. They're all together. And I think  I have the most connections. And I probably am most likely to pull in the  numbers we need to go against the Savage, Jeremy, Stephen clan over there.  This game has changed a lot since the beginning. A lot of people are... With  all the different swaps and stuff, this is really murky.  Uh-huh.  There's a split.  You could be on the list because you're a big challenge person.  I'm not a big challenge person. Everybody in this game is a big challenge  person.  I had a conversation in Kass, and I fell like she was fishing for  information, but I know Kass is working with Ta Keo. So I figured i'd just  give her a begus story about my alliance.  I don't think we're Bayon strong. I’m in the tight with Stephen.  So Bayon is no more?  I would say no. Kass was the reason for me going home the first time I played.  I put my trust in Kass, and what did she do? She flipped. In this second  chance, there is no way I will allow Kass another opportunity to ruin my  game.  It's whoever the group wants.  I tried the talk to Tasha. I was telling the truth, but I didn't get the same  sincerity. It was very clear. She doesn't trust me. She never trusted me.  She's still hung up on kagayan. This is it. Don't mess with my second chance.  You just unleashed the beast.  I think the lines are emerging today.  You think so?  Indeed.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I know Tasha can be a firecracker, and I’m definitely ready to rumble.  Thank you.  You're welcome. It's really the original Bayon people that are going to run  this show unless someone here is willing to upset the applecart. God forbid  it's chaos Kass that actually does that.  I feel like yesterday went bad.  Well, you did say to me that the Bayon thing is no more.  How would I say Bayon's no more when that's all I’m working with.  But I asked you point blank.  Kass, I’m not going to tell you what I really think because I didn't trust  you, so for you to even trust what I said was a real conversation is...  It's the old Tasha. You didn't learn from your last game.  All I’m saying is... Actually, I did, I learned not to trust you. That's what  I learned.  Tasha planted all these seeds of deception. I don't think it was smart of  her. She played right into my hand. I could tell all of her little allies Tasha  told me bye-bye Bayon.  Here's the deal. You just told me all I need to know. Here's the line. It's  been drawn. Game on. I want the win second chance, and if I have to use chaos  Kass, I will.  I had a conversation with Kass. And just so people know, she told me a false  story. She said no more Bayon to me.  I did not say no more. How could I say no more Bayon.  You just said it to me.  How can I say bye-bye Bayon.  You just admitted that you told me that.  You think I’m going to tell you the truth.  You guys are bringing in history, can we just do a clean slate?  Not when someone tells me a lie.  Kass...  People should think about who they're working with and how they're behaving. Tasha  doesn't trust me.  Tasha walks in with Kass and it created chaos around camp about how people  are turning on each other. But I can use that for my advantage. So this is  definitely a strong group, Bayon. So I wanted to plant a little bit of doubt  and break them up. Let's see how that plays out.  We saw how close Savage was getting to Woo. Savage and Woo made comments to  me and Kass that wow were a big threat.  So Woo and Savage made a deal to come after Jeremy.  No, no, no. They didn't make a deal. It was a comment that was made with Woo  and Savage that there were big people at the merge who needed to go, and you  and Joe were one of them.  Tasha and Kass are just going at us, and then suddenly Ciera was saying something  about me.  You just woke up a raging bull. I never mentioned his name or Joe and there  is not any chance in hell I would ever go after them. So don't create that  impression, don't lie...  I am not lying. I’m not backtracking on what was said.  You have a really nasty, two-headed dragon that's wreaking havoc in our  beautiful little tribe, and we're going to take one of the heads and just lop  it off.  Jeff: Come on in, guys. So, Ciera, tell me about the merge. How did I got?  With all the chaos and all the conversations going on around camp, we don't  really know where lines are drawn yet. We could figure that out at the first  tribal, so it's definitely a good time to have that necklace around your  neck.  Jeff: You guys ready to get to your first individual immunity idol?  Yes.  Jeff: First things first. Ciera, i'll take back tribal immunity. Thank you.  Tribal immunity is no more. Individual immunity is now what you seek.  Fancy.  Jeff: It's a beauty. And it will look really good around your neck. With this  you are safe from the vote. Without it you are vulnerable. Shall we get to  today's challenge? For today's challenge, you're going to stand on a narrow  beam while balancing a ball on a platform. Regular intervals. Your feet are  going to move down to a more narrow beam and your hand will move further down  the pole, making it more difficult to balance. At any point you fall off the  beam, drop your ball, you're out of the challenge. Last person left standing  wins immunity, safe from the vote. Losers, tribal council, where somebody  will be the seventh person voted out of this game. This challenge first ran  in brains versus brawn versus beauty. Spencer, Kass, Tasha, all three ran it,  came down to a showdown between Spencer and Tasha. Tasha won immunity. So second  chance opportunities here for Spencer sure. We'll drop -- draw for spots,  we'll get started. All right. Here we go. Everybody put your balls on top of  your platform. I’m going to count you down from five. Your hand has to be off  when we get to one. Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one... Release your  hands. This challenge is on. We'll do ten minutes in each section for those  of you who last. Stephen Fishbach first person out. Take a spot on the bench.  We're down to 12 just like that. Only a few seconds in our first person drops  this is a challenge in which, if you stop thinking about what you're doing  even for a moment, that is all it will take and you'll be out. Keith, a lot  of movement. Keith is out.  Dang.  Jeff: Keith joins Fishbach, second person out. Ciera starting to move. Ciera  can't hang on. Third person out. Kimmi drops out. Ten seconds left in this  round. Almost there. Hang in there. Five, four, three, two, one. Everybody  put your hand on your ball. You are safe. You're now going to move down to  the second level. It is more narrow, and you're going to move your hand down  further on the pole. All right. Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one.  Everybody release. And we are back on. Abi is out one second into this second  round. You're holding a lot more pole now, and the beam is more narrow. You  have less wiggle room in both aspects of this challenge. Kass drops out. No  second chance redemption for Kass. Just like that Wiglesworth drops.  Wentworth drops. We're now down to four men, one woman, and the one woman is  the woman who won this the only other time it has played. 15 seconds left in  this section. Hang in there. Five, four, three, two, one. Everybody's safe.  Move down to the next section. [applause]ãi all right. Everybody is now in the third section.  I’m going to count you in. Five, four, three, two, one. This challenge is  back on.  Come on.  Jeff: Savage with a nice recovery, but he can't keep it. Savage is the first  out. We're down to four. This is a very tough section. Two newbies to this  challenge, Joe and Jeremy, two veterans, the only people who have played this  challenge, Spencer and Tasha. Who will win today? Jeremy right on the edge  but a nice recovery. Tasha with a nice recovery. Can she do it again? No. Tasha  is out. Jeremy is out. We are down to two, just like that. It is Joe and Spencer.  Big second chance story for Spencer. He lost to Tasha the first time we did  this challenge during brains, brawn and beauty. Can he redeem right here  against one of the most fierce competitors in the game, Joe. Spencer  wobbling. Nice recovery. Huge recovery. Can he keep it? Another recovery. But  he can't do it. Spencer drops. Joe wins first individual immunity. [applause]   congratulation, Joe.  Jeff: Joe, come on over.  Beautiful, beautiful.  Jeff: First individual immunity win. Safe from the vote at tribal council  tonight. As for the rest of you, after 19 days in your second-chance  adventure, somebody will come up short. You have the afternoon to figure out  who that's going to be. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight  at tribal.  Big decision tonight. I've been put in a spot where myself and Spencer are  big swing votes, and all I know is I’m glad I have the necklace, because it's  going to be one hell of a tribal.  Good job, brother.  First immunity challenge, I just wanted to win. I wanted to make a statement.   You look like a gladiator.  There are these young studs. I wanted to show I can hang with them. But Kass  and Ciera didn't win immunity.  In my season, I never lied to anyone. And here I have never lied to anyone.  The ringleader was Kass with Ciera right behind her. They're coming up with  lies, they're almost believable. That's what's so dangerous about them. But  from my perspective,'d rather have Ciera go. Ly never forget what Ciera did.  And in my mind she's done.  It seems like an easy decision right, after this morning.  I will tell you guys, I can't trust Ciera. She's super dangerous. She makes  up these lies that are kind of believable. They're always...  She wasn't even the worst. I thought Kass was much worst.  I think they're both feeding off each other.  How do we do this?  I feel like Kass is kind of stirring up the most right now.  With this vote i'd rather have Ciera go. She is so dangerous. For me she's  public enemy number one and has to go.  I'm leaning toward Kass.  That's a an across-the-board vote.  At this point if the majority wants Kass, sometimes it's best just to go with  the majority, because Kass is almost a little ruthless and a little bit  haphazard, and that scares me.  As far as who you want to do? It's got to be someone who is causing problems.  Who do you think?  I'm thinking Kass.  Kass.  That's the move. You know what I mean? That's fine and dandy with me.  I've been conflicted about which way to go, but I feel the numbers going  where they're going, and not stopping to wait for me. Kass was the only  person on the last vote that was willing to play with me, and even though I want  to save her, I’m not sure I can.  I don't think she does.  It looks like everybody is voting Kass. But Kass could have an idol, you know  what I mean? It's always good to split votes.  I know I’m voting Kass.  Kass.  Kass.  We have the numbers to vote her out.  Say she has an idol, how do you stop that?  It's 5-4 split.  Five Kass, four Ciera.  So five Kass, four Ciera.  I think that's foolproof, right?  That's the ideal way.  I hate to say, this you know, but if they want Kass down, I’m down for it.  She stirs up a lot of bickering. At this point i'd just al-azawi soon let her  go.  The bree down is happening.  It's such an ugly sight just to watch. What's the name of that thing that  eats people, vultures? Is that what it's called?  They're just... Whatever.  I should have anticipated this. It started with Tasha. Now I think Keith's  going with the majority. Why would they be sitting there talking?  They'll split the vote. They'll split five-four.  They have the majority. So they might split the vote, and if I can get five  people to agree to vote tash, Tasha's gone.  They're splitting.  All we need is five. They're splitting votes.  If we all vote Tasha, they're all stuck in it. If we can get to Spencer,  we're good with him, we'll see what's up?  Being second-time players, I think we all understand they could be splitting  the vote. After the huge blowout fight today, there is a definite chance that  it could be me going home tonight. &gt;&gt;ideally I would love if Kass could  get Spencer so we could make a move before it's too late.  They're splitting votes. If we get five, we can get out.  Yeah.  Abi and Ciera and wentworth said she would do it.  We all voting Tasha?  We are.  This is a chance to make a move that furthers both of us.  I know. Okay.  You had my back.  Let's do it.  Okay.  There will be a vote tonight between Kass and Ciera and Tasha.  It's getting ugly for no reason.  It will be better after tonight.  My decision tonight will determine who goes home. I always thought Tasha was  a friend, but Kass and Ciera actually had my back and saved me. My luck has  truly turned around. I have never been in this position before to influence  the game.  Jeff: For those of you who don't yet have a torch, go ahead and grab one, dip  it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual at tribal council because fire  represents your life. When your fire is gone, so are you. So biggest tribal  council we've ever had. Ciera, today at the challenge, I just briefly asked  how things were going, and the response I got led me to believe that it's  pretty chaotic.  Chaotic is putting it mildly. I knew coming into this second-chance season it  was going to be quick and fast, but, man, it's beyond words how crazy it's  been.  Jeff: Kass, is there a point even for someone like you who thrives in total  chaos where you think, this is too much even for me?  Well, I’m not playing the chaos game this time. I find it funny that some  people who claim to be calm are in the center of chaos.  Jeff: Like who?  Like Tasha?  Don't even play. Don't even play. Do not even play with me right now. Chaos  is what she operates in. I don't operate in that. So if there is chaos,  that's her m.o., that's not mine. But I’m going to call you on your stuff.  She told me the Bayon alliance was over.  No, I did not.  But Kass in some regard is not creating lies. Some things she's saying are  true.  Don't spin it in a way that's advantageous for you and said, Tasha said  bye-bye buyon. I don't speak like that.  Jeff: Are you talking to Kass or Ciera?  I'm talking to both.  Jeff: Ciera are you concerned about guilt by association?  Yes. You never want to be part of nikkeiors in this game or have anybody  looking to you. But obviously my name was brought up, so that's the reality  of the game.  Jeff: So Joe, it sounds to me that despite the fact of sierra's name has been  mentioned, Kass has been mentioned, tash has been in an argument. It could be  anybody.  It could be anybody, but it's the first vote after the merge, and everyone is  afraid to jump on one side of the fence or the other, so the easiest vote are  these three right here.  Jeff: Ciera how does it feel ho-to-have Joe say it seems easy, Ciera, Kass or  Tasha.  It should not be easy. It should be going for the jugular, like if this is  such an easy vote, you're not playing the right vote. And I don't lake  playing with people who are scared the play. I want the win. It's not fun to  play with people who don't want to win?  Jeff: What does that mean? Everybody wants to win.  Only one person will win this game. So everybody should be looking out for  themselves. I have played in a situation where I played for six. Don't. Let's  play for one, whatever that means to you. If it means getting rid of me, go  play to win.  Jeff: Spencer, I’m guessing you would say, I am playing.  Well, I think playing is different things to different people. Every day of  the game. Tomorrow playing may look very different.  Jeff: Row. Fishbach, that's a big comment. Because typically in this game you  say, Jeff, we've got a tight five, got a tight six. Spencer is saying  tonight's vote is tonight's vote and tomorrow is a whole new thing.  This game is moving so fast, it's so strange. What typical merge has three  small women as their presumptive roots? Things are changing now, not just in  this game but I think in the history of "Survivor" strategy. I think  we're seeing an evolution in the way the entire game is played.  Jeff: Spencer. Maybe you don't need an alliance at all. You just need voting  blocs for each tribal.  I think given the last three days and given the pace of this game, I would  not be surprised at anything changing.  Jeff: Ciera, is that what you're looking for, is that kind of game play,  which is, yeah, I’m with you, for the moment?  Not necessarily. There is an element to trusting people, but you want to be  in your one, two, three, four, you don't want to be six, seven, eight, nine.  And somebody here is six, seven, eight, nine. When you realize that's where  you're at, that's where game mode comes in. Let's play. That's all I’m saying.   Jeff: It is time to vote. When worth, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. If  anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it, now would be the  time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person  voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll  read the votes. First vote Kass. Ciera. Tasha. One vote Kass, one vote Ciera,  one vote Tasha. Kass. Ciera. Tasha. Two votes Kass, two votes Ciera, two  votes Tasha. Kass. Ciera. Savage. That's three votes Kass, three votes Ciera,  two votes Tasha, one vote Savage. Kass. Ciera. We're tied again. Four votes Kass,  four votes Ciera, two votes Tasha, one vote Savage. Kass. Five votes Kass.  Four votes Ciera. One vote left. Seventh person voted out of "Survivor:  Second chance" and the first member of our jury, Kass. You need to bring  me your torch.  Sorry, Kass.  Jeff: Kass, the tribe has spoken. Well, if tonight's tribal is any indication  of how the rest of the season is going to gosh, it's going to be a wild ride.  Grab your torch, head back to camp. Good night.  Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.  Jeff: Next time on "Survivor"...  I made a big move  Jeff: Everyone is worried about big moves.  It's time to do something here. It's time to go for someone who is a real  threat to win this game.  Jeff: The only question is: Who will strike first?  People will only be loyal so long.  This time I came in, and I wanted to build relationships with people and work  on my social game, and I think I had a good change for the 18 days. I wasn't  on the radar for anything, but I tried to bring out chaos Kass and really threw  a bomb on my game. I just got caught. So it's on me.
