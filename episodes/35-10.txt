<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," after the merge,  the majority alliance was running the game. <br/>We need a Healer gone. <br/>Jeff: But trust came into question. <br/>I thought I trusted Ryan,  man. <br/>Jeff: And cracks began to form. <br/>People are starting to feel steam rolled by you. <br/>No, no, they are not. <br/>At this way it's ben's way or the highway. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Mike tried to change the game. <br/>Trust me. <br/>Jeff: He caused chaos. <br/>I think you guys are  showing poor moral character here. <br/>Do you want the bury yourself? You didn't have to open your mouth. <br/>I’m playing it for me. <br/>Jeff: In the end, the majority stuck together and sent Cole  to the jury. Cole, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Jeff: Nine are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Mike, that was hilarious. Thank you for not informing me. <br/>My pleasure. I had to do something to spice it up a little bit. <br/>Spice it up a little bit, but that was a stupid reason to  play your idol, though. <br/>Tribal council was crazy and fun. The seven accomplished exactly what they needed to accomplish,  which was mainly vote out Cole. But the best part of the night was when out of left field dr. Mike played an idol, for in reason at all. It was icing on the cake. So at this point, we have two Healers left to vote out. Joe and Mike are dead men walking. <br/>It doesn't make any sense. <br/>I'll tell you what. <br/>Tell me later. <br/>I'll tell you later. I had to play my idol for two reasons. One, because I’m not going to be that idiot that goes home with  an idol in his pocket. But I also knew there was chance that they might write Joe  instead of me, and I need him with me. So I had the make sure they were going to write my name. Now my vote comes along with another vote, so we're a bloc of  two, versus Cole staying here, I’m still just a bloc of one. So make sure you're still here. <br/>I appreciate that,  but...  Nice try, lady liberty. <br/>It didn't go anywhere. <br/>At tribal make just exploded. He was the villain, which I was upset because that's my role,  that's my lane. But he definitely messed up with the idol, because no one knew  he had an idol, so we could have used it down the road for a blind side for  him and I to move forward in the game. Now we're just two swing votes with no alliance, no power, and  no idol. <br/>If you try to do something as a team thing, you have to  like talk it out first. Let me know what's going on. I'm over there like, what? <br/>It appears that I might have put a target on my back after  this tribal council, but the reality is I already had a target on my back. I needed to start playing my game, and my game is I’m going to  convince you seven why you need to crack. <br/>No, man. <br/>Where did Mike go? <br/>He's looking for another idol. <br/>Everybody thinks I’m that crazy doctor, but I’m here to  win this game. I'm not here the make it to nine or to eight or to seven. The seven has the break up at some point. Now is going to be the time to act some, yes, it might appear I’m  on the bottom right now, but stay tuned. I think it's about to get really good. I think it's about to get really good. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. Let's get to today's reward challenge. For today's challenge, you're going to use your feet only. On my go you'll release a rope that. Will drop blocks into a bin. You will then stack those blocks in a circle and place a flag in  the center. First person to finish wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Sure. <br/>Jeff: You'll be taken on a sea plane for an aerial tour of  the sacred island, truly one of the most beautiful places in fiji. You will then enjoy cheeseburgers. <br/>Oh. <br/>Jeff: French fries. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Ice-cold beer. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: I know it's worth playing for. Take your spots. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. For reward, Survivors ready? Go! You are barefoot using only your feet. The first step is to untie that rope, release those pieces. Everybody has their blocks released. Now you start building a foundation. You're going to rely on that to get you all the way to the top. Another metaphor for "Survivor." building foundations  every day, trying to get an alliance that you can trust, knowing it could  topple at any moment, which will happen out here. Lauren off to a fast start. Mike making fast work of this. Ashley getting some momentum going. Once you get that bottom level, you start on that second level. But you got to keep it stable, because there is a third level. And then a flag. Lauren working on that second level. Mike starting on his second level. Here goes Ashley. JP Starting on his second level. Right now it is Lauren in the lead. Mike right on her tail. Ryan still working on that bottom level. Ben taking his time. Devon taking his time. Joe trying the stay in it. You never ever know what skills will be required on "Survivor."  Mike with another piece. Mike now working on his third level. It's now Mike in the lead. Lauren right next to him feeling that panic. You could be so close to a cheeseburger and not taste it if you  don't win. Chrissy getting close to finishing that second level. Ashley now working on that top level. Lauren with another piece. Mike with another piece. After a crazy tribal council, who knows where Mike stands in  this game. Reward would be nice. Mike with another piece. Here comes Ashley with another piece up top. Chrissy now at the top row. It is now Mike, then Lauren, Ashley, and Chrissy. Everybody hoping Mike will drop and open the door, but Mike has  got a rhythm, and it is working. Mike down to one piece left. Mike places his last piece on the top. If he can get it to stick, a lot of action with those toes. It's there. Mike now going for the flag. Lauren trying to adjust. Ashley picking up the pace. Mike could win it right here if he can get that flag up and over  no! Mike drops a piece. Got to put the flag back in the hole, get that piece back in  your bin, and repair it. That opens the door now. Ashley can feel it. Lauren can feel it. Now it is Lauren going for the flag. Can she get that last element, a skinny little flag up over the  top and into its slot? Lauren hovering. Here goes Mike trying again for the flag. Lauren does it! Lauren wins individual reward. Second challenge win in a row. <br/>There you go, Lauren. <br/>Nice job. <br/>Nice job, Lauren. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, come on over. [applause]  Feels good. <br/>Jeff: It feels good? <br/>Yeah, it feels really good. <br/>Jeff: All right, Lauren. So tricky part of this reward is you're going to bring somebody  with you. 25 days into this game, alliances have been all over the map,  never know who you can trust, who are you bringing? <br/>Devon. <br/>Jeff: Devon, come on over. [applause]  Jeff: There's room on that sea plane for another person. Who are you going to bring? <br/>Ben. <br/>Jeff: Ben joins Devon. One last seat, one final choice, and in picking one person to  join you, you send five people back to camp for rice and coconut and extreme  heat. <br/>Ashley. <br/>Jeff: Didn't even hesitate. <br/>Love you. <br/>Jeff: Ryan, do you read into this? Is this "Survivor" as usual, somebody wins and they  make their move? <br/>No, I don't read into it. Devon is a big guy, and he needs that sustenance, and Ben and Ashley  haven't been on a reward, so I support Lauren in her decision. <br/>Jeff: All right. Lauren, Devon, ben, Ashley, nice afternoon. Sea plane, cheeseburgers, fries. Grab your stuff and head out. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Jeff: JP, Ryan, Joe, Mike, Chrissy, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>I picked those people for  strategic reasons. This reward would be a good opportunity to change the future of  my game tremendously. They do think they're a strong group of seven, and it's in the a  strong group of seven. It's getting ready to blow up. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>This is faster than any jet-ski I've been on. <br/>You can sigh the reefs perfectly. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>That's our home over there. <br/>Is that it? That's it. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>Bye-bye. <br/>There's people. <br/>Joe. Ha, ha. <br/>It's very low. My wife would be mad at me if I was on that thing. I am mad. The reward challenge was mine to win, and I lost it. It sucks. And now I’m stuck on the beach with Chrissy, Ryan, and JP, who  are literally just blinded by the seven. They just want to play a comfortable game, let's get Joe and Mike  out. So it's a day for Joe and I to stir things up. We're like siskel and ebert. <br/>It's like an eenie meenie miney mo situation. <br/>Can you do me a favor and get into another fight with Chrissy. <br/>Maybe I'll leave with a bang. <br/>Mike, you're in rare form this afternoon. <br/>Mike, what are we going to call our table? <br/>Kids table? <br/>What are we going to call it? I think we should start our own. <br/>The cocoa nuts. It describes his dominican roots, which is slightly cocoa, and  it describes my urology. <br/>We're the cocoa nut. <br/>I love cheeseburgers. I'm absolutely starving. And now I have to continue to wipe the coconut comedy show. It's getting annoying, but it's been so beneficial to have  people like Mike and Joe on the outside who nobody want to work with, so it's  making it a lot easier to get to that seven than it normally should be in a  season of "Survivor."  I do think we need to get  Joe out next to avoid any sort of weird... I think that is because he's a  good player. <br/>I think so, too. <br/>So who do you think after next two? <br/>If I had to do it right now, Ben seven, Lauren six, and...  Ben's got to go. We still have to get out Mike and Joe, but me and Chrissy are  looking down the road. Our focus at this point is on Ben has the first vote going into  the seven. Ben's a strong player. He's going to be really tough the beat in the end, and it's so  funny, ben's the one that's saying, let's stick with the seven, stick with  the seven, yeah, we're sticking with it, but you're going to be number seven. <br/>I am being stupid that  thinking that the seven of us will get to the seven? <br/>I think it's going to  happen. <br/>I think it's going to  happen, too. My intuition tells me that we're going to do it. <br/>100%. <br/>Hey, everybody. <br/>Beautiful. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Burgers. <br/>Heaven on earth. It didn't take me two seconds to eat that chooseburger. I dropped mustard on my pants. I'm thinking, I ain't had a bath in 20-something days. What's mustard going to hurt now? The whole time I’m thinking let everybody eat, feel good, and  then we can start talking serious business. <br/>Thank you, Lauren. <br/>Yes, thank you, Lauren. <br/>You know what, we've all worked really hard. I honestly, like right now, we're all here individually playing against  each other. But you have to have a certain amount of people to get control  of the game, and Chrissy, Ryan, and JP, they're fooling themselves if they  think they're going to keep the seven together forever. This is perfect timing. This is why I picked you guys. I think this is a good group, you know, and I mean, you would be  Hero, Hero, Hustler, Hustler. I'm going to keep right on hustling. Seven is a great number to get to, but that seven will not last  forever. And if you're stupid enough to think it will last, something is  wrong. JP, Chrissy and Ryan feel a little bit too comfortable right  now. So to me it's the perfect time to beat them to the punch and  break up the numbers before it breaks up on us. Let's get all out in the open, what do you know what, do I know,  what do you know, and what do you know? Let's take all this information and use it against them? <br/>Ryan has an idol. Ryan has the merge idol. Ryan told me I was the only one he was telling, and he told me  not to tell anyone, and I have trusted Ryan. <br/>I found a secret  advantage, and it's still in play. Okay. And what it is is basically I have an extra vote. <br/>Damn. <br/>There's a lot of telling of things and this girl hasn't  been told anything. <br/>Lauren's plan the break from the seven early is an awesome  idea. And if I want to be in on this stuff and really be the one  making decisions and not justing with told what to do, then I need to step up  the aggression. I need to step up my game play. <br/>They're never going to expect Ben and Joe together. If you can put your differences aside and you can put your  differences aside and play the game the way we need to go ahead and play it,  because this is not personal, this is business. <br/>Here's where the tricky part comes in. <br/>Well, the tricky part is Joe and Mike need to stick around  for a little while. <br/>It's impossible to live with Joe. <br/>I’m sick of being called  king arthur. I'm sick of trying to keep everyone in line and straight. But right now if I need to keep Joe, I'll do it. <br/>With t whole circle roundtable, that's going to hurt you. They're going to aim for you right off the bat. <br/>That's why I’m on board. Ly ride to the end with you four. <br/>Can we solidify this right now? <br/>Over a beer. <br/>We can take control of the game. <br/>To the final four. <br/>To the final four. <br/>This is awesome. <br/>Beautiful. I love it. <br/>Lauren has been surprising me. She came into this game talking no strategy, and now I’m seeing  this other side of her, and she's really good. She's like as good as me. And I’m happy she's on my side. And I think this plan is going to work. This is what "Survivor" is all about. This moment. <br/>Anyone want any more burger patties. You never know what can happen at rewards. <br/>Oh. Oh, my gosh, guys. These are letters. <br/>No! <br/>I got a letter from my  daughter, and it just said, "Dear mama, and that was it." I lost  it. I am a single mother. I have to fight for every time that I've gotten. And it's a good reminder that I have to make big moves for her. That's the whole point of me being here is to not give up on  her. I'm not here just for myself. I'm here for her and for her future. It's not for me. <br/>Thank you, Lauren. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>Yeah, thank you. <br/>And for those guys to get it also, I think it meant a lot  to them, and I think that it actually brought us closer together. So we can actually make this happen. <br/>I really am glad that I won  today. <br/>I am, too. <br/>I am, too. <br/>This bonded us even more than that cheers. I'm in the walking away from this. <br/>This is where we flip the game. Beautiful. <br/>It's a start the a new day. What better way the start the day than hearing from your family? So sitting up there with my wife and my two kids, I know it's a  letter, but you can hear her talking those words, you know? And wyatt wrote me a letter, too, and his writing is getting  better. And I love my wife. I love her to death. She changed my life. She saved my life. When you go through combat and you come back, a lot of people  have a hard time doing it, and I qloa her the world. She's why I’m out here. I'm here to play the game. My family just gave me the gas and the fuel I need the play this  game. <br/>Oh, my God. Out of nowhere I see an ax and it says "Dig." at first  I think there's an immunity idol, but it's a clue to where the immunity idol  is sitting. I've been looking since day one for an idol. I lost it. No way. No the marine in me, when there is a mission or a task to be  done, it is go time. Right now I have map. I have an objective, and I’m going to go get the job done. My mission now is to get to this idol. You know, I’m sweeping the area like I would clearing a room. It's got to be right around here somewhere. You have to keep a keen you out for something that looks out of  place. And I have to find this, but you have to keep a calm and cool  head, think quickly, but think clearly. A clay pot in the middle of the hook. A big clay pot in the middle of the hook. A big clay pot in the middle of a hook. Oh, my gosh. Thank you, family. Thank you so much. I found an idol on "Survivor." I have never been in  happy in my entire life to wear a darn necklace of shells. Huge. Huge. At this point the seventh blowing up and my name has been thrun  around. I'm being called king arthur. So I need the idol. And I ain't telling no one about it, because nobody around here  can keep a darn secret. Oh, my gosh. This gets me one step closer to a million. Oh, my gosh, I needed this so bad. And I believe my wife helped me find this idol. So thank you, honey, this one is for you, and this one is from  you. <br/>Jeff: All right. Let's get to today's immunity challenge. First things first, Lauren, got to take back the necklace. Thank you. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's chang you're going to bAlance on a triangular  platform with your feet perched on very narrow footholds. At regular intervals we'll move up making it more difficult. If at any point your hands touch the structure or you fall off,  you're out. Last person left standing wins immunity, safe from the vote. Losers tribal council will somebody will be the tenth person  voted out and become the third member of our jury. 27 days into this game, there's been a lot of talk about  alliances, a roundtable, a secure seven. Well, if you feel really secure with your position in the game  right now, I’m going to offer you something that may be hard to pass up. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: You can forego this challenge that's going to be  certain pain and instead indulge in something that is guaranteed pleasure. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: You can skip today's challenge and instead feast on  peanut butter and chocolate. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: I'll give you a minute to think about it, and we'll  get started. All right. Decisions have been made. Devon, ben, and Lauren decided to sit out of the challenge and  participate in eating chocolate and peanut butter, giving up their shot at  immunity, while Mike, Ashley, Ryan, Chrissy, Joe, and JP Said, nope, I’m not that secure, I’m going to try to win it. All right. This is heavy. There is no way you can eat it all. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Jeff: You can eat until the challenge ends. Everybody take your first position. Hold on until you get comfortable, and then I'll count you in. <br/>Come on, Mike, we got this. <br/>Jeff: Five, four, three, two, one... All right. Everybody is in their first position. And this challenge is on. We'll be here 20 minutes. Hands cannot touch, butt cannot touch. This would be almost impossible to do on a fully rested, fully  fueled body, let alone after 27 days on "Survivor." you're tested  on every level, and now you're out in the middle of the ocean bAlancing on a  triangular platform. Mike, what will your kids think when they see this, you and your  filthy yellow shirt still competing on "Survivor" with only nine  people left? <br/>I just have to convince  them I’m not crazy, Jeff, and then they'll be proud of me. <br/>Too late for that. <br/>Coconuts, Mike. <br/>Yep, we're the coconut. He's cocoa and I’m nuts. <br/>Jeff: A little water movement. There and JP Almost got caught off bAlance. That's how fast you get lulled into sleep. You've got to stay limber and loose. Anticipate. Ryan with a nice one. It will catch you quickly. You feel it. It comes out of nowhere. Joe really struggling. If you touch, you're out. JP With a big stretch, nice recovery. <br/>Hey, Jeff, do you want to get down on this? <br/>New york I’m good. That's for you guys. Thanks, ben. A lot of fun being had over here. It's amazing what peanut butter and chocolate does for the  spirit. <br/>Jeff: JP Another nice save. JP Has been all over the place but has not fallen. <br/>He's going down. <br/>Jeff: JP Can't hang in any longer. JP Is first out. No shot at immunity. We are down to five. You're halfway through this section. Then we'll move up. All right. It is time now to move enter your final spot, where you will be  for the rest of the challenge. Everybody is safe. You can touch. Hold on until you get your bAlance. Everybody move up on to that top level now. <br/>Whoa, that is not easy. <br/>Jeff: Now it gets fun. Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one. And we are back. Chrissy can only hang for a second. Mike almost drops. Nice recovery. Joe with a nice save. Joe really struggling to stay up there. Joe can't do it. Joe is now out. We're down to three. Three very different positions. Mike sideways, turned away from everybody. Ashley head-on like she is surfing, and Ryan crouched, all  fighting for immunity 27 days into "Survivor."  I’m in the heaving "Survivor"  without winning an immunity. <br/>Jeff: Ashley flirting with disaster. Ryan playing with fire with those hand, bAlancing on one foot  and then the toes of the other, but he doesn't want to try to move. Too risky. Ashley really struggling. Ryan can't hold his position anymore. Ryan drops. We're down to two. And they are side by side. It is dr. Mike and Ashley, a Healer and a Hero battling it out on day 27  for immunity on "Survivor." Ashley rock solid. <br/>That's what I like to hear. <br/>Jeff: Mike right on the edge of disaster. Fatigue now starting to set in. Ashley with a little bit of movement. Mike out of nowhere drops. It's over. Ashley wins individual immunity, safe from the vote tonight at  tribal council. What a challenge. Ashley, come on over. [applause] Ashley safe tonight at tribal after 27 day, will not  be voted out of this game. As for the rest of you, I know how hard it is out here. I know 39 days is a goal. For somebody tonight that will cut short. Tenth person voted out, third member of our jury. Grab your stuff. Swim out and see you at survival. <br/>JP, Chrissy and Ryan didn't win, and that works perfectly  for our plan. I'm like a giddy little kid about this vote tonight. Now it's time to pull the trigger and make it happen. <br/>Awesome job, ash. <br/>Good job, Ashley. Good job, Mike. I was impressed, Mike. BAlance isn't usually your thing. <br/>Mike, you have many more skills than you let on. <br/>I was very surprised that  ben, Lauren, and Devon chose to eat. I thought we had a job to do in taking out Joe and Mike. What am I, a romanian gymnast, like I’m going to be doing  backflips on the platform? That led a bad taste in my mouth, and luckily Ashley won. Now we get to decide who will stay between Mike and Joe. What are you thinking for tonight? <br/>I guess Mike is starting  to become quite the commander. <br/>I would be happy with  either one. <br/>Joe is more likely to find the idol. <br/>I don't care. Just let me know. <br/>I don't care. They're both the same. <br/>I’m with you. <br/>I feel very comfortable  with our alliance of seven. We're definitely unified in wanting to get out Joe or Mike. I can't wait to get rid of both of them, but getting rid of one  of them will break up this new coconut Alike, which is making us all bananas. <br/>Everybody expects Joe to go next. I think it would be a little bit fun to vote out Mike and leave Joel  until the end. I feel like that would be fun. <br/>Boys on Mike, girls on Joe? <br/>Okay. <br/>I look at Chrissy and Ryan,  and I see the power blinding them. I see the cluelessness in how confident they're acting. It's mind blowing. That needs to be changed, and myself along with my alliance is  going to be the one to change that. <br/>Look, this whole trust in the seven alliance is crap. We have to think about ourselves. There's no point in getting rid of Joe and Mike. Who do we take out first? Right now is the point in this game that we have to take control  and break up JP, Chrissy, and Ryan. They're all threats, in my opinion. Chrissy is just a huge thinker. She is such a mastermind. JP Is a huge threat because he might not be good at bAlancing, but  he is good at everything else. And Ryan is a huge threat because he has an idol. This is a great time to flush that idol and get rid of him. Starting tonight, the game is really on. <br/>It's up to us to take charge. <br/>We don't do it now, then we're not going to have the  numbers. <br/>It's going down tonight, but moving forward, we need the  maintain control. After the biggest blind side yet, so I've come up with a plan to  do it very subtly. <br/>Hey, big guy. <br/>Hey. <br/>What's up? <br/>This is what I think. I think you should vote Mike. <br/>Really? <br/>Because obviously ben's with us. We don't want Ben to know. We don't want Joe to know. We don't want Mike to know. Ben is with us, yet he's going to pretend like he's not with us. So after tribal council, Chrissy, Ryan, or JP, whoever is left,  will come running to him. They're in for a rude awakening, and it's going to be classic to  see the looks on their faces. I mean, this is what "Survivor" is all about. But ben's voting with them, we need Mike and Joe to vote with us  to just keep numbers. <br/>If they know Ben is a part of it, they could switch over. <br/>All right. I'm down with that. Are you down with that? <br/>My mission now is to stay on the inside of JP, Chrissy, and  Ryan, and infill trail when we get back the tribal. What do you guys think? <br/>I’m good with Mike. <br/>We'll have the numbers. <br/>They're going to be lived. <br/>Tribal council is going to be fun to watch. Because we're going to pull the rug out from underneath them. So I got to get me acting shoes on, and they need to get Mike  and Joe. <br/>We want the talk to you guys. They still think seven strong and you two are out. <br/>Yeah. <br/>That's not going to happen. <br/>Fair enough. <br/>Us five, and Ben is still going to think it's seven  strong, and if you don't believe me, you'll see at tribal, you'll be here. <br/>Oh, my gosh, it's happening. The seven has split, as I knew they would. <br/>Just talk to me. <br/>I will vote whoever you  want me to vote for. <br/>All of a sudden the court jesser the has become merlin and  I’m going to make them disappear one by one. <br/>Chrissy, JP, and Ryan have no idea that we're actually  tricking them, which is the funny part. They think they're in charge, and I’m glad that's the pace  they're on, because I’m a page ahead of them. You have to think about every little scenario, because once you  make the play, there is no taking it back. Tribal is going to be a huge blind side. I mean, the seven is going to get blown up, and it's going to be  fireworks at camp tonight. Fourth of july is coming early. <br/>Jeff: Now bring in the members of our jury. Desi and Cole voted out at the last tribal council. So dr. Mike, last tribal council the Healers were in trouble. You played an idol, Cole was voted out. Was there any fallout? <br/>You know, it looked like I was crazy at the last tribal  the reality was I needed to reinvent the game. I needed to say the same thing that Joe said but because I’m a  doctor hope that people believe it because I say it. <br/>Jeff: That's crazy than what he said last tribal council,  that because he's a doctor, people would believe him. It's as if Mike and Joe are just these little toys you are  playing with, batting back and forth. <br/>Well, we're not necessarily playing with them. I think comedy routine started with the two of them, and they  are giving us a show. All day long. <br/>Jeff: Mike, is that an angle, just tir them enter thinking  I’m so nuts they become charmed by me? <br/>Absolutely. Look at us, we're two votes. That was the goal of last tribal. It's to keep Joe around for us to be a two-vote bloc, and we're  out there. Two votes. <br/>Ryan, is that part of the threat, that they're cocoa-nuts. <br/>It's a package deal, buy one get one free, but Mike's  pitches to me are completely inaccurate about what's actually happening  within the seven because we have been so strong. Yeah, you could use Mike and Joe as the swing vote, but it just  doesn't make a lot of sense, but again, I give them credit for at least  trying. <br/>Jeff: Joe, Ryan is saying, if you're going to make a  pitch, the pitch has to line up with my vision. <br/>That's the problem. Me and Mike may line up with someone else's vision. <br/>Jeff: Wow, Devon, Joe just said a few words, but he said I  don't have to line up with everybody, just somebody. <br/>That's all these two need, they're looking for cracks. Maybe one day they will find one, maybe they won't. There's no saying. <br/>Jeff: So Lauren, if it is seven strong, is this the calm  before the storm? <br/>I have a feeling it's getting  ready to be a perfect storm. This can only last for so long. You know, I wish there were seven seats at the very end, there  isn't, there's only three. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, the seven is ultimately still a mirage, as Lauren  said, the game doesn't end with seven. <br/>Well, clearly we all have different relationships with  each other. Some of us have just been on tribes with each other longer, so I  don't think that any of us have the same equal relationship with each of the  six other people on the tribe. The question is: How do we manage our own ways to the end. I don't know. <br/>Jeff: Joe, that's the opening that you and Mike are  looking for, is when one smaller group tries to figure out another smaller  group and you try to get right in there and say, I’m the missing vote you  need. <br/>She said one of the other six. We're not in the tribe. They don't even consider us. We're the two kids in the neighborhood, we want the play "Survivor,"  but they don't let us play. The seven don't understand that we're two solid votes. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, you all have sat here and talked about this  seven. But the minute we actually get down to it, everybody does seem  to be in agreement, yeah, I’m pretty sure there's some alliances within the  seven. <br/>Let's just say we're not all sitting at the fire as seven,  saying, okay, which one of us seven is going to go next. We're not doing that, you know what I mean? <br/>Jeff: Ryan, when does that moment happen? <br/>It happens when people don't know what's happening. If you don't think it's happening, that's when you know it's  happening. <br/>On top of, that you can't get to plan "B" unless  you get through plan "A." sometimes you get caught looking so far  down the game you forget what's happening in front of your face and before  you know it, you're the one going home. <br/>I don't think we're  playing this game as poorly as Joe would like to think. We're not all thinking this is a magical seven, but it tarts  there. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, what Ryan said is late terrifying. It's happening when you don't know it's happening. <br/>Which is why you can never stop playing this game. You have to play it while you sleep. You have to play it while you eat. Who -- you have the play it while you pee. The moment you stop playing, there are conversations behind you  and you're request in the dust. <br/>Jeff: It's exhausting. <br/>I think the best way is  to find the people you trust in your game. They are your eyes and your ears. It gives you a break because you know they're thinking with you. <br/>Jeff: Ben, how comfortable are you thinking that you could  look at somebody in your alliance and say, you in particular, I believe I can  trust? <br/>Trust is going to get you to the end of the game. You have to trust two or three other people. That's a fact. But finding trust in a game of so much distrust is the hard  part. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, how confident are you that you can trust  the people in your alliance that you've only known 27 days and those 27 days  have been on "Survivor"? <br/>I would like to believe  that I can fully trust the people in my closest alliance, and I feel they  have come through for me in the past and have proven their loyalty and their  trust. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Ryan, you're up. <br/>See you later, cocoa-nut. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now will be the time to do so. Once the votes are read, the decision is final, person voted out  will be asked the leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Mike. Joe. Mike. Two votes Mike. One vote Joe. Mike. Three votes Mike, one vote Joe. JP One vote JP JP That's two votes JP We're tied. Three votes JP, three votes Mike, one vote Joe. JP That's four votes JP, three votes Mike. One vote Joe, one vote left. Tenth person voted out and the third member of our jury, JP, you  need to bring me your torch. JP, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Damn, they got me good. <br/>Jeff: Well, based on the shocked reaction, it sounds like Ryan  had it right. When is it happening? When you don't know it's happening. Grab you torches, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Can someone please explain what happened? So how did that play out? <br/>If we're going to tell you, absolutely not we're not going  to tell you. Do we look like idiots? We're coconut, but we're not idiot. Just be lucky it wasn't you. <br/>It was well played coming from a guy who said he would  never be a puppet. <br/>You could be upset and bitter. Me and Mike have been in the bottom for how long? We've never been bitter. We've been happy around camp. Just be happy you're around camp. <br/>I’m upset about the blind  side, but I’m more upset about the way that those five treated us three when  we got back to camp. Am I allowed to ask how long... When the plan was crafted? Am I allowed to ask that? <br/>You can ask, but I’m not going to answer? <br/>Blind sides are part of the game, being snarky to your  friends is not. That is the part that's frustrating to me. Clearly they're not friends. Whatever. <br/>Thank you for saving me, you know. <br/>So I tried to be very gracious. I just said, good move, everybody, well played. Even though I’m infuriated. I thought I had it made. I'm just happy to be here. <br/>You're fine. <br/>It's a very new feeling being on the bottom. I really need to think how I’m going to recover from this. <br/>I never make a move and  share. <br/>You didn't make a move. You got drug along. <br/>Guess what...  The great puppet guy who will never be a puppet. That's what happened. <br/>It wasn't you, ben. <br/>Mike and Joe are pretty much in the dark of me working  with Ashley, Devon, and Lauren, but Joe is walking around like it was his  damn idea to blind side JP <br/>Buy one, get one free. You keep me, Mike sticks around. <br/>He did what a good little puppet would do. You pull the strings, you make sure you write JP, and he did. What was the reason for JP, out of curiosity? <br/>You guys are asking confidential information. <br/>I should get an award for  the performance I put on after I got back the camp. I'm doing my best double agent whatever you want to call it. I'm playing the role of being on the outs with Chrissy and Ryan  to gather intel when I know that I have my alliance of four in Lauren, Devon,  Ashley and myself. <br/>JP Going homeworked out as planned. And it was perfect timing because it gave us the upper hand. It just reversed the role. Chrissy, JP, and Ryan felt like they were on the top. Now Ryan and Chrissy are sitting on the bottom. They know it. <br/>Well played. <br/>That was really well played. <br/>That was good. Chrissy and Ryan think that I’m in with them. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And I'll get Ryan to play his idol. <br/>And you are going to tell us. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Dude, I had to do it, man. <br/>You know I’m in the mad at you. <br/>I know, I know. I know you're not. <br/>I never thought I would  have to repair my trust with Devon. Devon and I have been together since day one. I have given him every single ounce of information that I've had  in this game. And he blind sided me. He could have sent me home. <br/>The reason you didn't know about this vote was because...  Well, you told me that I was going, you and me. <br/> No, you were the only one I told. <br/>Ever since Ryan lied to me about him and I being the only  ones about the idol, that lie caused me to no longer trusted him anymore. <br/>I have never wavered from  me, you, and Lauren from going to the final three. I voted the way we said we were going to vote. <br/>I trust Ashley and I trust  Lauren and I want to trust you, but that scared me. To be honest, that really scared me. We've had an alliance since day one, but it is a selfish game in  the end. And I have my own plan to get me to win that million, and he's  no longer a part of it. <br/>All right. Everyone come get a seashell. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I grew up watching "Survivor,"  but you don't realize how mentally straining it is, and my whole game up  until this point has been very cloudy, but now everything is becoming much  more clear. Is it just me or are you feeling like really good? <br/>I’m really good. <br/>You did so well. But you realize we vote off one more person and we're guaranteed  final four, because then we have the majority and then we can be open. <br/>All right. <br/>We don't even have to hide. <br/>Even right now we have Lauren's vote. It really doesn't matter, because once we have us four a majority,  we're set. Having Ben being our secret agent, I know where the idol is. I know where the advantages are, and I know what every single  player is thinking. <br/>It's between Chrissy and Joe for sure. The only reason I want the keep Joe over Chrissy is I think Chrissy's  more of a challenge threat than Joe. For the first time in this game I’m calling the shots, and I don't  think anyone knows that I’m as good at this game as I am. So I’m sitting in the best possible seat in this game. So I’m sitting in the best possible seat in this game. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. Let's get to today's reward challenge. For today's challenge, we're going to randomly divide into two  teams of four. On my go, you'll swim out the a boat, then paddle to shore,  collecting three bags of logs along the way. You'll then use those logs to push puzzle pieces through a  tunnel. Once all the pieces are out, you will use them to complete a Survivor  puzzle. First four to finish wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>The winning four will enjoy a Survivor spa. You will enjoy a nice shower. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: You'll then enjoy massages. And then you'll eat chicken, veggie wraps, fresh fruit, and for  dessert, key lime and pecan pie. <br/>No, way. Yummy. <br/>Pecan pie. I like it. <br/>Jeff: Losers, nothing. We'll draw for teams. We'll get started. Let's do this! All right. We randomly divided into teams. We have Lauren, Ryan, Mike, and Chrissy taking on ben, Ashley, Joe,  and Devon. For reward, Survivors ready? Go! First you got to get everybody in the boat. Mike is trying to get up in the boat for red. Devon trying to get up in there for blue. Start paddling. Red finally has everyone in the boat. It is blue off to the early lead now, working toward that first  platform. Devon's got first bag. And they are heavy. Blue with the early lead. Here comes red. <br/>Wait, wait, wait. <br/>Push it down, push it down. <br/>Jeff: Can Ryan get that bag off the platform? It weighs more than he does. He's going to need help. Now it's in the water. <br/>Give me your hand, give me your hand so you won't fall. <br/>Jeff: Red finally has their first bag. Ben now has the second bag for blue. The blue boat now has paddled away from ben. He can't put the pieces in now. You've got to get back the that platform. <br/>Come on. Get the pieces in. <br/>Jeff: Blue struggling now. <br/>Come on, they're struggling, let's go. <br/>Jeff: Ben makes it. You're good, blue. Red now has made up a lot of time. Mike hops off. Has the puzzle pieces for red. Blue heading for their third and final bag of logs. Here comes red. Mike is going to jump off for red. Blue with a much easier time this time. Paddle to shore now. Red has their third bag. Paddle to shore. They are dead even again. Both teams now trying to clip in. You're good, blue. You're good, red. Now you have to get all the pieces up the beach. Cannot start untying until you have all three bags. Lauren taking one by herself, and a lot of weight. This is now where blue's strength is coming into play. They get all three bags up quickly. Start untying. <br/>I need help with this  one. <br/>Red really struggling. Chrissy and Ryan cannot get out that bag. Blue, you're good. You can start shoving logs through. Here comes Ryan and Chrissy. You're good. Start untying. You have to get all your logs through this tunnel, and as you  push those logs, you are pushing your puzzle pieces out the other side. That is your next goal. Blue now extending their lead. Devon and Ben alternating pushing those logs through. And with every push, they release more puzzle pieces. <br/>Go, Lauren! <br/>Jeff: Red has theirs free. Red can start pushing. Blue has all of theirs through. You're good, blue. Now you have to get all the pieces up on your puzzle table. Let's go, red! Lauren using her whole body to push these logs through. Wood digging into skin. She doesn't care. It's "Survivor." Ben and Ashley starting on the puzzle  for blue. Lauren has been a workhorse in this challenge using her body to  shove these logs through. That will do it. Go, red. Ben and Ashley have had a lot of time to start getting used to  this puzzle. <br/>To the left of it. <br/>Jeff: It's going to be Mike and Chrissy working for red,  and they have a big task ahead of them. Blue has had a big hea start. This would be a gigantic comeback for Mike and Chrissy if they  can pull it off. Ben and Ashley now have to trade pieces around. Something is not right. That's opening the door for red. Devon sees its. Something is not right. Panic starts to set in and then you start the make more  mistakes. Momentum can shift quickly. Red is starting to make some progress over here. <br/>That way, that way, that way. <br/>Jeff: They can sense they're back in this because Ashley  and Ben are slowing down. <br/>You guys got it? You guys got it? Something is not right on blue. And this is exactly what red was hoping for. <br/>That way, that way. <br/>Jeff: A mistake. <br/>Here, here. <br/>Jeff: Ben and Ashley making quick moves. They think they have it. <br/>We got it, we got it, we got it. <br/>Heroes versus Healers, versus Hustlers. <br/>Jeff: You're good! Reward for Joe, Devon, ben, and Ashley. <br/>We had a minute left. <br/>We could have gotten it. <br/>Jeff: Joe, ben, Ashley and Devon waiting for you a Survivor  spa, while the other four, Lauren, Chrissy, Ryan, and Mike can do nothing but  wish it was them. Grab your stuff. <br/>I felt confident we were  going to win, and we won. It feels great. I no longer am on the bottom, and I have a true alliance. The tables have turned. Massage. <br/>To our win. <br/>Salude. <br/>Good job. I'm so proud of us. This is going to boost our game. The reward is amazing. To have a spa day and shower and get massages and heat wraps. It's like hitting a restart button on my body. <br/>Try one of these. <br/>But there is still strategy in mind. So Ben is still playing the role of the dethroned king, and Joe  is still eating it up. <br/>I love living this way. Like a king. <br/>Right. <br/>You should feel right at home then, king arthur. <br/>You're a jerk. <br/>To king arthur. <br/>Cheers to my disloyal knights. <br/>It would be nice to kick back and relax with Devon and Ashley,  but I’m still playing my part as being on the outs, but that is kind of fun  for me now just because I’m messing with Joe and he don't even know it. Any time I can mess with Joe, I'll take it  Life is good. <br/>When your alliance turns on you, it's not so fun. Did you have that planned from the get-go, or when did... You  don't have to answer, but...  I don't know. <br/>My lips are sealed. <br/>I'd rather not talk about it honestly. <br/>All right. That's fair. <br/>That's just a move we made and the game moves on. <br/>Ben has been the leader of this pack. He doesn't know how to play this game without power and control. He wants to talk about the game obviously, and we're just like,  dude, we're not going to talk about it. Now he knows how I felt. <br/>Well, hopefully I’m not next, that's all I’m going the  say. <br/>You're a dangerous man, but there are a lot of dangerous  people out here. <br/>Ben is still putting on his academy award performance as a  very disappointed king arthur, and he sells it like I've never seen a story  sold. It's awesome. But he's playing a really good game, and that's pretty scary. But he's playing a really good game, and that's pretty scary. <br/>That looks good on you. <br/>Howdy, partner. <br/>You're lucky we got to know each other that well. <br/>This is awesome. <br/>We're getting together. <br/>Last night was like the turning point of this entire game  for me and you. <br/>Yeah. Because we finally made a big move. <br/>And now everyone is scrambling. <br/>I’m feeling like this  game just up to a whole other level for me. Coming into the merge, I definitely took a backseat in my own  game, but my game play has really evolved, and I feel like I’m finally  playing "Survivor."  It's good. It's a good feeling. <br/>Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. <br/>Making that big move set the pace for some more big moves  down the road. I honestly feel like this is my game to lose. <br/>It was a fun challenge today, though. <br/>Fun? Was it, though? <br/>Where is fun in that challenge? <br/>I feel like nothing is  going my way. I can't win a veggie wrap. That's how bad things are going right now. I have an idol in my pocket, but I don't want to just play it  once and then just go home the next time, so I need to talk to Mike, because  if we can work together and we can show that we both have been left out of  votes, we have both within on the bottom, I think it would endear us to each  other and just maybe I could swing him over and have the numbers back on our  side. <br/>"Survivor" is very situational. <br/>Extremely. I mean, it's not just five, you, Lauren, Devon, Joe and  yourself? And again, I know, you don't have to...  I can't say. <br/>I got it. <br/>When you look at where I was three tribals ago to where I am  today, I went from the bottom to the top, and now I have a nice alliance of  five. We have a plan to work together, and I’m sticking to that plan. <br/>I still want the work  with you, Mike. <br/>You never wanted to work with me. I gave you so many opportunities to work with me. <br/>No question. <br/>For a week I gave you opportunities to work with me. <br/>The game changes, you know that. <br/>Uh-huh. The game does change. <br/>I went up to Ryan every  day for at least a week and said, let's work together, and he said no. I think I’m pretty good right now, unfortunately. Well, unfortunately for you. You know? He said to me right before tribal council he wasn't voting for  me, and then he voted for me, and he has the nerve to come up to me the next  day and say, you know, Mike I've always wanted to work with you. Well, isn't it just a buck late and a dollar short? <br/>This might sound totally bizarre, because you and I have  not talked strategy. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>But Ryan and I have talked strategy prior to yesterday. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>I expected Chrissy to try  to want the talk to me, and I just, uh-huh, uh-huh, but that's as far as it  goes. It's very annoying. <br/>He has talked about going final three with you. I don't know if he's mentioned it to you. <br/>No, but I mean...  I don't know what your  sort of plan is, what your personal path to the end is...  I'll listen to you all day long, but that doesn't mean I’m  going to change my mind. <br/>Let's start having conversations. <br/>Who else are you having conversations with? <br/>Well, if you wanted to work with me you would have talked  to me several weeks ago and not today. <br/>I've jumped ship once. I'm not going to jump ship again. <br/>I believe that ben, Ryan,  and I are the next ones to be voted off. So Lauren does somewhat have my fate in her hands. <br/>I opened the topic, but  she just didn't want to talk strategy with me. <br/>This is so wonderful. <br/>Isn't it, though? They don't want to be seen as desperate, but that's how I’m feeling  today. This game is kicking my butt, and it is a new feeling for me. And right now I am definitely in trouble, because I don't want  to  Are you okay? <br/>New york I think that I’m just... I’m just hungry. <br/>Hungry, tired of sleeping on bamboo, wet, cold? <br/>Do you need a hug or anything? <br/>Being out here, being stripped down to nothing is way  harder than I thought it would be, because in the real world, I’m always in  control of everything. And it's hard for me to not be in control of my own fate. That is why this game kicks your ass. I really don't want it to be the end of the line. <br/>Thank you for cooking the rice. This has been my years for 16 years, and what I do as an actuary  is come up with all of the possible outcome, so I will always keep thinking  of different combinations and different ways that I can get myself back on  top. I hope that I can have the last laugh. I hope that I can have the last laugh. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. <br/>Wow. <br/>Hell no. <br/>That looks hard. <br/>Jeff: All right. Shall we get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First things first, Ashley, got the take back the necklace. <br/>All right, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Thank you. <br/>Hard to give up. <br/>Jeff: I know it is. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's chang, you're going to use a "Survivor"  driving wheel to transport a key through a series of obstacles. That key will unlock a set of block puzzle pieces. You'll transport those to the finish and use them to solve a  word puzzle. First person to finish wins immunity, guaranteed a one in seven  shot at getting to the end. Losers, tribal council where somebody will be the 11th person  voted out, the fourths member of our jury. Draw for spots, get it on. All right. Here we go. For immonti, guaranteed spot in the final seven, Survivors  ready? Go! First stage, transport that key through these obstacles. If it drops, you've got to go back. Ashley up first. There's ben. There goes Devon and Ryan. Ashley drops. She's got to go back. Ben is good. Devon, you're good. Ryan drops. He's got to go back. Lauren's got to go back. Here comes Joe. He's good. Mike drops, got to go back, Chrissy is good. Now you got to go across a bAlance beam. Ben really working it carefully. It is Devon, ben, Joe, and Chrissy now in this second section. A little more difficult. You have some speed bumps. Ben is good again. Ben can now unrock his puzzle pieces. Devon is across. Start unlocking now. Joe slow and steady. Joe is across. Ben releases his pieces. Ashley coming across now. You're good, Ashley. Now you got to stack your pieces and get to the finish. Chrissy, you're good. Here comes Mike. Mike drops again. Ryan and Mike still back in the first section. Lauren, you're good. Ben now has his pieces free. Ben taking this first section with four pieces. Here goes Devon with four pieces. He's moving quickly. Devon now in the lead. It is Devon and ben, dump them in and go back and get more. You have to get them all in the bin before you can go back. Ben right on Devon's tale with four. Devon in the lead, then ben. Joe drops. Got to start again. Here comes Ashley with four. It is now Devon and Ben racing, carrying those driving wheels. Get them all in the ben, Ashley. Immunity on the line. You do not want to go home tonight. Here comes Chrissy with four. Devon with four more. Lauren now with her first four. Mike is through the first section. Ryan is through the first section. He's now in the second section. Devon in the lead, then ben. Then Joe, Chrissy, Lauren and Ashley. Devon with his last four puzzle blocks. Ben going to be right behind him. There's Ashley now getting very creative with eight blocks at  once. Devon has all his. Start working on the puzzle. Ashley's across. Just like that Ashley is back in this. Huge move by Ashley and it works. She won the last immunity challenge. Would love to win it again. And Devon, Ashley, and Ben already starting on their puzzle. Chrissy drops three more. She's got to go back. Chrissy is taking a long time, but trying to get back in this. We're this close to the million dollars. You have to dig in right now. There is one word: You solve it, you are safe in this game. It won't be easy. You know that. This is "Survivor."  No idea. <br/>Jeff: Lauren coming back with her final four puzzle  pieces. Chrissy with her last four pieces. You're still in this. Let's go! We are close. Anybody could win this right now. Chrissy putting pieces in. Lauren putting pieces in. One word: What could it be? You can see the wear and tear of 30 days, not easy. Eight people all fighting for immunity, security tonight at  tribal council. Chrissy places one letter and another. Devon stepping back to look at Chrissy's puzzle, all is fair in  "Survivor." Devon now quickly races up and thinks he has something. Devon is movings a fast as he can. Ben looking for some help. Ben now has an idea. Ashley now getting in on this. It's going to coming down to how fast you can solve this puzzle. Chrissy one block after another, Devon thinks he has it. Ben thinks he has something. <br/>Got it! <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, say it:  Invulnerable! <br/>Jeff: Chrissy pulls it out, wins individual immunity, safe  from tribal council. <br/>Good job, baby. <br/>Thanks! <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, come on over. <br/>I've been waiting for this for 16 years. <br/>Jeff: Really? You are beaming right now. What is this dreaming when you dream about playing "Survivor"  and you pull off one of the most iconic moments, winning  I really needed it  tonight. It's an incredible feeling to know I'll be here tomorrow on day  31. <br/>Jeff: Guaranteed a spot in the final seven. As for the rest of you, sadly for one of you tonight, 11th person  voted out, fourth member of our jury, it won't be you. Grab your stuff back at camp. See you tonight at tribal council. It won't be you. <br/>Thank you. I am invulnerable. Finally won an individual immunity challenge. I really believe I was the one who was going to go home, so  coming home with this necklace is just beautiful in so many  Good job, Chrissy. <br/>I knew I was done. <br/>A 12-letter word? I don't even have a 12-letter word in my vocabulary. <br/>After the challenge, even with Chrissy winning, there are  three other people to pick and send home, so no harm no foul. Now we just need to get to getting and figure out who is voted  out next. <br/>Number-one thing is who we're voting out. <br/>Joe. We don't need Joe anymore, yo. We don't need Joe. <br/>We really don't. Let's do Joe. Easy, simple, Joe. Done deal. <br/>My alliance of four is going to vote Joe. Now, we have to come up with this whole new pitch to Joe and Mike. So why don't we just tell Joe and Mike we're going to use your  extra vote tonight, but we're not going to use it some we'll tell them, me, Joe,  and Mike will all vote Ryan, and you'll say you, and Ashley and your extra  vote will vote ben. That way we're safe, and then we're only voting Joe out. I come up with this idea to tell them to split the votes between  Ryan and ben, but the reality is myself, Ashley, Lauren, and ben, are going  to vote Joer and Joe will go home. <br/>All right. We have a plan. Lauren's got an extra vote. <br/>Whenever I want the use it. <br/>We're going to use it tonight. So here's what we're going to do. You, Mike, and me are going to vote Ryan. Lauren, her extra geaux vote ben. Ryan plays the idol, they revote and we all vote ben. <br/>They don't know about the extra vote? <br/>No. <br/>This is amazing. Lauren has an advantage which gives her the ability to actually  vote twice. So right now I mean I’m ecstatic. I feel so much safer just knowing that advantage is going to be  used. <br/>We have plan. <br/>I’m solid, guys. I ain't going nowhere. <br/>Honestly, I can't wait to see Ben go. He's the biggest threat in this game. I'm excited for Ben to go home because Ben is the biggest threat  out here at this point. He will do anything to win this game. <br/>So we don't even need the talk about it anymore. It's set. <br/>And Ben has betrayed me multiple times. Full me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I'm not going to let Ben fool me again. <br/>Let me say, this I think any way they split the votes it's  going to be you. <br/>If they're smart. <br/>Yeah. I mean, they have to know that we would vote as a bloc. <br/>Who would you guys want to vote for? <br/>I got to get Ashley and Devon  out. Devon screwed you, too. And Ashley screwed me. <br/>What Ashley did to you...  How did we get tricked by two 25 year old surfers? <br/>Gosh dang it, that stinks, y'all. <br/>This whole act that I’m putting on, y'all, it is late  exhausting. But it's for a good cause to this point. So I just need to get through one more tribal and play the poor  me, why me, oh, me card. <br/>They novi the idol. <br/>Everybody knows. <br/>I might play it. I might not. I don't know. <br/>I would. If I had one, I would play it. It gets you to day 31. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Whatever happens, it's been a pleasure. <br/>I still have an idol, but  I don't feel I need to play it. And for tonight to actually happen the way it's supposed to  happen, put a sucker in my hand and a balloon in the other, an I'll be  sitting there like a little kid in a candy store just watching Joe get his  torch snuffed. <br/>I’m just thinking, we  would be crazy to take him to four. <br/>I agree 100%, citizenning  next to him. <br/>Everyone would vote ben. <br/>Yeah. <br/>He's a strong, a leader, the kids. Shoot, I would vote ben. <br/>Timing is everything in this game. And it could be the time to vote Ben out, because he has made  big decision, and he has been the king in his roundtable and all that stuff. You know why don't Joe and Mike use the votes we need to use  them. Me, and you and Devon need the talk about us three, vote Ben out. <br/>Right now it's ben, myself, Lauren, and Devon. And Joe is the one we're voting out, but it seems like Ben would  be a huge threat at the end, and I realize that this game you have to be  aggressive, and I’m starting to do that. <br/>It's nothing against ben, but he'll win. <br/>Taking out the stronger players is I think... Ben could go  home tonight. This could be our chance to make that happen. <br/>I am considering an  alternative plan about getting Ben out. <br/>Are you serious? <br/>Yes. <br/>Oh, my gosh. Wow. <br/>Shhh. That's a move right there for both of us. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Ben's thinking of big moves. Ben is dangerous. <br/>And it would have to be 100% a blindside. <br/>I don't know. It's between Ben and Joe. <br/>Which one do you think? <br/>This is hard. This is a difficult decision. I'm having a hard time here thinking. <br/>This vote is not an easy one. Ben is included in our alliance, but I realize that Ben is a big  threat. I need to make big moves in this game to succeed, so I got to  keep doing what I’m doing, and I got to be ruthless, but also I have to be  smart and make the right decision. <br/>Jeff: We now bring in the members of our jury. Desi, Cole, and JP Voted out at the last tribal council. Mike, let's start with you. You walk into tribal down sill, day, 30 smiling. <br/>I’m just loving it, Jeff. I mean, I’m living a dream. I'm still here. My tribe vibes me. I vibe them. I think I’m doing pretty good. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, you had a little bit of that excitement  today. You win this challenge, and you said 16 years been waiting on  this moment. <br/>I started trying to play  this game in 2001. I finally got the dream, and then I got to win individual  immunity some you can't help but be joyful even at a time like tribal council  where somebody has to go home and it very well could have been me had I not  had this beautiful necklace on my neck. <br/>Jeff: Joe, can you relate the crisis. Even though tribal is where people are voted out, but there is  this excitement that this is where the game is won and lost. <br/>Tribal is exciting because we want to see how strong our  alliances are and how this game is going to go. Are people going to play safe or be risky. <br/>Jeff: Ben, Joe really said something interesting. At tribal is where you really test those alliances. <br/>That's right. Last week Chrissy, Ryan, and myself were blind sided. The three rogue nights and the two jesters have formed up, and  looks like I’m probably going home tonight, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Ryan, so Ben is being pretty clear that he believes  you, himself, and Chrissy are in trouble, and now it's not a seven, it's a  five. <br/>I think Ben put it  perfectly. You have Mike and Joe in the middle, and three people took  advantage of them. I don't know if it was complacency on our part or just  comfortability within the seven that we felt. <br/>Jeff: Owe is already shaking your head. Why are you shaking your head? <br/>It was never a seven. Ben failed to realize he wasn't king Ben with six knights. He was king Ben with queens and kings around him. He put his guard down and look what happened. <br/>Jeff: So do you take a little joy? <br/>A little? No. I take a lot of joy. <br/>I think "Survivor"  is one or lost by alliance management. I don't think they were managing their alliance appropriately. <br/>To address Joe's answer there, Jeff, he called every one  of us puppets, a bunch of goats and sheep and stuff like, that but now he's  sitting here calling his alliance kings and queens because he's knows he's on  the bottom. <br/>Jeff: Mike, Ben is basically saying, now you're in a  group, but you're still on the bottom because you and the other coconut are  the freelancers. <br/>You can see we're on the bottom of the group, but there is  an equal exchange of information from all five of us every time we get  together. Just because we're the newest members doesn't mean we're the  least important members of the alliance. <br/>He's right, looking from the outside in, they're trying to  find cracks. But I feel this is a true alliance and right now what's best for  us is to stick together. <br/>But that is exactly what was criticized about our old  alliance, and now that there's a five-person alliance instead of a seven, it's  a very tight diversion from what has been said believe tribal councils by  these exact people. <br/>I like they try the say  they did it with seven and we did it with five and why would we expect  something different. I look at it like two surgeons go into the operating room to do  the same operation and there is a different outcome? What is the difference? They're different surgeons. Because you didn't do it right doesn't mean we're not going to  do it right. <br/>Jeff: Devon, it's like "Survivor" is a white  board and you lay out your whole plan and the minute you do one plan, you  have to erase it and you have to have a brand-new plan hour by hour. <br/>Yeah, every tribal council is a completely new plan. And every time you vote someone off, that could affect your game  plan and turn it completely different direction. <br/>Jeff: Ashley, are you surprised at how much of this goes  on in "Survivor," or were you able to anticipate it just from being  a fan? <br/>I think the amount of ups  and downs in this game is impossible to anticipate, but it is all a test of  alliances, so you have to really pay attention because the ups and downs are  constant  So Chrissy, we're down to eight. At what point does it feel like maybe you can't penetrate an  alliance. There's just not enough time and not enough people left? <br/>I think that even if an  alliance is strong, you always keep trying to look for those cracks. You know, I suppose the time that you can't penetrate any longer  is when the next tribal council begins. <br/>Tribal council is like prom. You go with somebody you think you really like. At the end of the night you may leave with somebody else. Now, I've never been to prom, but I can imagine that's what it's  like. <br/>Jeff: So Joe, for many tribals you've been hanging on the  edge of the mountain. Do you feel more comfortable tonight? <br/>Yeah, I think this is first time in tribal I feel  comfortable. You know, and tonight I don't have an idol, so, yeah, I mean, I trust  the five that I’m with. <br/>Jeff: So ben, that's a pretty clear statement that our  alliance is built better than the other alliance was built. And that's why it's more powerful and going to stick together. <br/>Jeff, that's what every comfortable alliance says in this  game, and just like us, every comfortable alliance gets blind sided. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Mike, you're up. Mike, you're up. <br/>You're a dangerous player, so now it's time for you to go  home. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anyone has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. <br/>Jeff. I'm playing it. It's for me. <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Ryan will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote Ryan. Does not count. Ryan. Does not count. Ashley. Ashley. Two votes Ashley. Joe. That's two votes Ashley, one vote Joe. Joe. Two votes Ashley, two votes Joe. Joe. That's three votes Joe, two votes Ashley. One vote left. 11th person voted out and the fourth member of our jury. Joe, you need to bring me your torch. <br/>Good play, y'all. You're good players. <br/>Good game, Joe. <br/>That was an incredibly tight alliance. <br/>Jeff: Joe, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Well, that's two tribals in a row where everything  is not what it seem, which is why this game is so much fun to watch and so  difficult to play. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

Love brings everyone together. But it's every man for themselves. <br/>Something is definitely going on around here. Community necklace? I have to do whatever I have to do to keep myself in this game. <br/>Oh. They definitely got me. It was a good call on their part. We had an alliance of five, and obviously they really didn't  want me in that alliance. They just needed numbers. But I said like I says I was going the play. I played aggressive. I found a couple idols. I played my game. Kudos to them. I'm looking forward to seeing who is in the final three.
