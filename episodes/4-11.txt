<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor, the Soliantu camp embraced a new spirit. <br/>This is a new day we're starting here! <br/>The people that play this game fairly have a good chance to get to the top. <br/>Probst: The remaining members of John's shattered alliance fought with each other to stay in the game. <br/>From the get go, I didn't like you. <br/>Probst: Sean and Paschal won a Marquesan feast in the reward challenge. <br/>Felt like Julius Caesar, man. <br/>Probst: And they smuggled some food back to share with the rest of the tribe. <br/>Thank you so much for bringing food back. That is so nice of you. <br/>Probst: Tammy won a crucial immunity challenge. <br/>Whoo! Yes, yes, yes! <br/>Probst: And Soliantu went to Tribal Council, where Zoe was voted out of the tribe. Zoe, the tribe has spoken. Seven are left. Who will be voted out tonight? [ theme song playing] Day 28. [ theme song playing] Day 28. <br/>Ain't got long, sweetheart. <br/>I know. 11 days. 11 days to go, that's it. <br/>It was cold last night. <br/>It was freezing last night. <br/>Good morning. How you doing, Sean? <br/>Can't sleep. <br/>Can't sleep. My mattress. <br/>It's got some lumps. Lumpy.It's lumpy. Lumpy. <br/>We're all one big family, man, we spoon, we snuggle, but it's strictly for keeping warm. I mean the whole love tribe aspect of this game has been a fallacy to a certain point. Let's call ourselves the love tribe when this game is over, like will you really call me? Will I really call you? I think there are certain people who genuinely are affectionate and feel family vibes. But in the context of a game where people are trying to position themselves, can a love tribe truly exist? <br/>Don't you know it's your birthday? You're not supposed to be working on your birthday. <br/>Well, it is my birthday. <br/>Is it true? <br/>Yes, it is. <br/>Oh, my God, are you 20? Or 21. <br/>Happy birthday, girlfriend. Birthday girl! <br/>Got to blow it out. <br/>In celebration of V's birthday, we cut open the last two bananas and mango. Made her a little candle and sang to her this morning, 'cause we knew that was going to be the best meal of the day, so... Thank you, guys, so much. <br/>Happy birthday. <br/>If I wasn't at home, you guys are the next best thing to be with. <br/>That's very sweet. <br/>V's birthday was pretty subdued, but as much as I could, I kept trying to make her feel a little bit special, being that, you know, she's not with her husband and her family. <br/>I feel like we're all like used spark plugs, because I'm telling you it's a very, very difficult time for me food wise and just from the energy perspective. <br/>We don't really have much choice in our dinner, lunch and breakfast menu is pretty much troko, taro and definitely coconut. <br/>You know, we tried in the beginning, everybody's been out there, trying to catch something. And even though we talk about it I think our energy wanes as the day goes on, and the odds of us actually catching a fish are unfortunately diminishing. <br/>There are black tip baby sharks right here, in our front yard. And I'm determined. They swim right under my feet. I'm going to see if I can whack it because they come so close. You can see their little black fins popping out of the water. They're right here. But there's too much wave action here to see them. They're taunting us, it's crazy. It would be great food. <br/>You know what? From today's reward challenge, I would give anything if the reward was food. <br/>I never thought I could feel the inside of my ribs, but I do. <br/>Oh, I'd give anything if it was Oreo cookies and have, like, Twix or Snickers ice cream to put on top of the Oreo cookie, and just inhale. <br/>All the food that we've been dreaming about. <br/>Snickers, s'mores. <br/>Oh, big fudge brownie. <br/>Big fudge brownie. <br/>A hot skillet with caramel. <br/>Oh, God! Oh, that sounds so good! <br/>I think the sugar food fantasy is making things worse for everybody. They just sort of get people lethargic on a raft, thinking about it and talking about it instead of getting up and taking some action to find new food. It's fun, but at the same time. I do think the diversion is wrong. I don't think it's healthy. So I'm going to try to do some different things for food, and also mentally it's just a diversion. It feels better than sitting around talking about sweets. <br/>V, I'm holding on to a thread, baby. threat. What are you talking about? <br/>Just my energy, I can't put it into words. I'm just trying to hold on. <br/>We're just trying to conserve energy. It is a pull to through the day now. This is without a doubt the worst place I have ever been on Earth. And it's just a constant battle of dirt, filth, heat, sand, wind, insects. Everything about it is nasty, dirty, filthy-- it's just pure hell. <br/>See if my check came in. <br/>Let's see. A place mat. <br/>"You're about to hit rock bottom." All right, let's show this to everybody else. <br/>Was there anything else in there? <br/>Let me see. Yep. Here. Birthday wish, baby. Come on, give me a birthday hug. I got it. Happy Birthday to You. Happy Birthay Dear sepia and I wanna say Happy Birthday to you. <br/>Oh, my brother. Thank you so much. <br/>I know how much this means to be away from home and our family on this day. I just want to tell you happy birthday, sister, I love you, okay? <br/>No one likes to be away from home on their birthday, of course not. But at that point that was kind of tough. Because I really hadn't thought too much about being away from Leander on my birthday. So it was a little special and a little sad as well. I miss him so much. I can't wait to see him. <br/>I know. <br/>But we are here and we are going to do this. God is with us, each and every day. <br/>We've been blessed beyond our means, okay. We can head back and give it 100%. We'll have a nice meal there. <br/>That's right. We gotta remember that. <br/>Exactly. <br/>You guys, we got some good tree mail! <br/>Very good. <br/>Somebody may be getting a nice hot shower. <br/>Ready? "Should we just give you treasures, I wouldn't hold your breath. "You're about to hit rock bottom if you're faster than the rest. "The style of the rich and famous, pampered like a king, "hot showers, clean clothes, great food. That's what victory brings." Oh, my gosh! <br/>God, we have to dive again. <br/>Yeah, we got to go down. <br/>Down, and it's going to be tough going underwater. [indistinct chatter] I can swim to save my life if you give me a short distance, but I don't really feel too comfortable in a whole lot of water. <br/>The worst thing you can do is be over anxious, like over jealous or anxious. You just got to be real calm. <br/>Either way it's going to be tough. <br/>Oh, God, it's going to be hard. <br/>Well, hey, I'd like to win a reward. I'd like to win something. I need something. <br/>Look around, man, all of us are on our last leg. <br/>Probst: Good morning, guys. Today's reward challenge is an island version of musical chairs. First round starts with all seven of you. Scattered along the bottom of the ocean floor are six shells. They're marked by yellow rocks to make them more visible. The seven of you are going to dive down. Who ever comes up without a shell is eliminated. Next round, six people dive down for only five shells; we'll do this until we have four tribe members left. Those four will compete then in a final sprint from the dock to the shore carrying a 40-pound rock underwater. First one to drop the rock at my feet wins the reward. This is what you're playing for. [laughter] My personal Visa. Which I will loan you for one night. You'll take this Visa and you'll book yourself a room on a luxury cruise ship. That cruise ship right out there. [horn blowing] So you go on board, check in, make your way to your room. I imagine you'll want to take a nice, long, hot shower with all the amenities, and a fresh set of clothes. New clothes for the first time in 28 days. You'll then make your way to one of the observation decks where you will enjoy a full course meal. All right. Take a spot, wait for my go. There are six shells, first six of you back with these shells move onto the next round. Survivors ready! <br/>Yeah. Probst: Go! <br/>Probst: General and Paschal got a shell. Tammy's got one. Kathy's got a shell. There are still shells down there guys, don't quit. V, are you giving up? <br/>I'm giving up. <br/>Probst: Okay. Sean, there's the opportunity, baby. Let go of that buoy, swim over, find a shell and get it. <br/>I know, I just have to catch my breath. I am going to go there. <br/>Probst: Look at that. Neleh's got a shell. Find that little bit of extra strength and grab it. Look at that! Sean got a shell! Yes! [cheering] Nice job. <br/>Way to go. Whoo! <br/>Probst: Now you just got to do it again. Moving on to the next round. V, you can head back to the beach. This round we're looking for five. There are five shells. Survivors ready! GoÂ ! General and Paschal got a shell. Tammy's got one. Kathy's got a shell. Neleh's got a shell. There it is. We got all five. Nice work. Kathy, General, Neleh, Tammy, Paschal, moving on. Sean, when you get your breath, you're swimming in. Nice effort. Here we go, guys. First four back with shells move on to the final round. Survivors ready! Go! Kathy's got one. Tammy's got one. Paschal's got one. General's got it. That's it, Neleh. Catch your breath. Neleh is going to swim on back. You four stay here. Wait for my go. First one to bring a yellow stone back to me wins. Survivors ready! Go! <br/>Come on pap! Come on, Pappy! Bring it home! <br/>Yeah, Pappy! <br/>Come on, Pap! <br/>Probst: Paschal is pulling away. [cheering] Come on, baby! <br/>Come on, baby, come on now! <br/>Come on, Pappy! <br/>Bring it home! <br/>Don't look back. Don't look back. You're doing great. Come on, man. <br/>Come on, Paps. [all cheering Paschal on] Probst: Nice job. Well earned. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Here's the deal. I'll hold on to the Visa card, we're going to bring the cruise ship to you. We'll get you a shower and some food. Guys, good effort, everybody out there. <br/>Wow, Pappy, your own cruise ship. There it is! Oh, Pap, way to go, baby. <br/>Very cool. <br/>All of a sudden there's this cruise ship, and the closer the ship got, the more excited I got. And I was ready to swim out to it. It's a beautiful sight.All for me. <br/>Don't cheat yourself on the desserts, Pas, you know that. <br/>You know what's really good, bananas foster, because we're on French Polynesia. <br/>That's the thing to get? <br/>That's a French dessert. <br/>Just open up the menu and say okay, bring it all on. <br/>Paschal! Come on aboard. <br/>Bye, guys! <br/>Bye! <br/>Bye, Pappy. He's going to be in a warm shower in no time. <br/>Probst: Okay, I got to tell you. I hate for you to have this great experience all alone. <br/>Okay, Probst: So, is there one tribe member you want to bring? <br/>You got to be kidding me. <br/>Probst: No. <br/>Neleh! [Neleh screams] Oh, wow. <br/>Have fun, Neleh! <br/>There was no conscious decision; it was automatic spontaneous reaction. She's just the epitome of a young lady that deserves it. It was a wonderful opportunity to enjoy something together. [Neleh shrieks] You deserved it.I mean you deserved it. <br/>Did she deserve as much as anybody else? I mean, to me, it was V's birthday that day. She was feeling a little down, and I don't know, had I won I would definitely have picked V. [Neleh screaming] Bye! <br/>Oh, my God! Oh, that is so sweet. <br/>If I go home tomorrow, I will be like the happiest woman in the whole wide world. We were just beside ourselves with excitement. I've never been on a cruise ship before, and I had never thought that it would be that beautiful. <br/>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Alright Thanky you. Oh, it smells so good, Paschal. Here, Pappy and I, we're these grubby little rugrats coming on to this really, really nice cruise ship. It was just awesome. <br/>Probst: Here's the deal, my Visa card. Michelle's going to check you in. Enjoy your night. <br/>We appreciate it. <br/>Probst: Okay. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Bye, guys. <br/>Bye, bye, Jeff. Thanks. Hello, how you doing? Good . This is really something. This is beautiful. <br/>This is your room key. Welcome aboard. <br/>Thank you so much. We're going to take you to your Oh, wow! <br/>Oh, look at this. <br/>Oh, my heavens. Paschal, there's candy right away! Our clothes-- we haven't had forever! <br/>Look at the view! Oh, How cool is this! I mean look at this! This is our own boat. The ship was just absolutely beautiful. I can imagine how the royalties of people on Earth must live, because that's what we were presented with. <br/>Oh, my gosh, Paschal, look at yourself in the mirror. <br/>Oh, no! <br/>It was just so weird to see myself for the first time. My hair looked like it was dark brown, just greasy dread locks. It was just gross. It just felt so refreshing to have hot water just pouring down your body. I mean, this was like luxury. I put my hair up in this nice fluffy white towel, put lotion all over. <br/>Whoo! Gosh! That was wonderful! I haven't felt this good in over a month. <br/>I felt like a whole new person. I didn't even feel like I was in the game anymore, to tell you the truth. This is a dream come true, paschal. We are so lucky to be here. I'm so lucky to be here with you. <br/>Oh, my heck! Oh, cool. We went around the corner and there's this one table set up, with the white linen cloth, like ten pieces of silverware. <br/>Cheers, darling, my little daughter. <br/>Cheers, Pappy. <br/>Oh, look what's coming. <br/>Don't even. Oh, my gosh, it's bread! <br/>Thanks. Oh, wow. Oh, my heck. <br/>The best bread I've ever had. <br/>The best butter I've ever had. <br/>To see them go off onto that boat and we came back here to prepare our muscley troko shells That was a tough one. None of us was happy. <br/>Neleh is probably ordering desert first. And then again desserts. <br/>Neleh's hair is probably nicely conditioned and shampooed, and it's probably just flowing so nicely right now. <br/>I bet you she got it blow dried. <br/>Just beautiful, and having a really good time. <br/>You guys think they'll be able to smuggle any food back? <br/>Yeah. <br/>So the next thing that came out was, oh, what's it called, what's the delicacy? <br/>Escargot, that's for you, sir. <br/>Thank you so much. I don't think I've ever had escargot. I knew what escargot was, but I couldn't envision that snail would taste good. <br/>Wow. <br/>Oh. <br/>Yum! <br/>Oh, my heck. Cream potatoes, vegetables. <br/>Oh, my heck. <br/>Would you care to have some wine? <br/>I wouldn't care for any. <br/>I wouldn't either. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I just hope they don't get upset and vote me out because of this. <br/>Paschal! <br/>Dessert was the final course and it was creme brulee which I've never eaten in my life. <br/>Ooh, what is that? <br/>It is so sugary. Man, that was good. I was really looking forward to the bill because I had no idea what something like this would cost, I figured maybe $150. <br/>Holy cow! Oh, my heck! <br/>The bill was $312. Which of course I didn't flinch because it was not my money. It could have been $3,000 and it wouldn't have mattered to me. Tip. That's $200. <br/>Thank you, sir. <br/>Worth every penny of it. <br/>Thank you, sir. Have a nice evening. <br/>Thank you. <br/>$200 tip. <br/>Paschal, I can't laugh anymore. I'm going to puke. <br/>They're going to have beer breath. <br/>No Neleh doesn't drink and neither does Paschal. They got the wrong people on board to do some drinking. <br/>Boy, that's for sure. <br/>I would have been throwing them back. <br/>We were all sitting on the raft waiting for them to come back. Everybody sitting there wondering, do you think they're going to bring food back? <br/>Hi! <br/>Hi. Did you have a great time? <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>Look at your blow-dried hair. <br/>We had the best time. <br/>Don't get near me, I smell. <br/>Oh, I'm going to puke if I get too close. <br/>Hi, guys. <br/>Look how cleaned up you guys are. <br/>The first thing I did was I stuck my face in Neleh's hair, and her hair just smelled fantastic. <br/>There's a bathroom off to the right and they had, you know,two sets of the shampoo and the like a loofah sponge. I had to take the loofah sponge and literally scrub. It's almost like when you peel stuff off your body, it's like that black flaky stuff. <br/>She was going on a little too much about her shower and how clean she was. She's so damn sweet. <br/>Anyway, and so the first thing they brought out was a big basket of bread. And then after that... The food sounded really good. It kind of sucked listening to them describe it in detail. <br/>I wish so bad I could have brought something back, you guys. I feel horrible telling you guys about this. Did you guys feel horrible telling us? <br/>No, but then we also brought back some food. <br/>The only thing I have left to share is this mint that I shoved in my mouth really fast. So if everybody wants to take a little nibble. <br/>I'm okay, sweetheart. <br/>No, you guys. It's good, it's a little hard mint; I don't want it. <br/>You're offering seven starving adults a piece of candy out of your mouth. Keep your mint candy, man. You know, that's like saying anybody want this piece of doo-doo. <br/>Nobody wants this? <br/>Morning, guys. <br/>Good morning. <br/>Look how clean you are. <br/>Oh, man. I had the best night's sleep ever. <br/>The next morning when we wake up, Neleh is still on the clean kick, just kind of being the princess. And has her feet propped up in her new clean clothes, looking at her nails. <br/>Can't believe my skin is clean. <br/>This is so weird. <br/>Who cares if your nails are clean or dirty? I mean, there's chores to be done and there's regular living back on Soliantu. She's one of those people who cleverly will have the perception that she's working, but I don't really see her carrying jugs. I don't see her lifting wood, I don't really see her doing the work that she says she's doing. But she's always the first one to go, "I have so much energy." I'm like I would too, if I wasn't doing anything but taking naps and walking and relaxing. <br/>How is your porridge coming, Kath? <br/>Well, let me see the ingredients. <br/>I think it's going to taste just like it did the other day. <br/>Yuck. <br/>Do you want porridge or do we want flank steak? [Paschal chuckling] [Paschal chuckling] I hear you, Pappy. <br/>You do? <br/>I think Neleh has definitely snowed Paschal and everyone else. I think she's playing this game harder than anybody left on this island, and she's playing sweet little girl next-door, and before you know it, hey, I'm in the finals and I'm so happy, and oh, God, this is, oh heck. <br/>And the bread, then you dip it... Hey, Neleh, you want to get green leaves for our taro? <br/>Absolutely. Porridge hot, porridge cold. <br/>I think Neleh has about 60 to 70% sweetness and about 30% or 40% she's working it. I think it's a little much right now, and she's working it too hard. She genuinely cares for everyone here, but I think she's working it with Paschal. She's hovering under his wings for protection. <br/>Paschal, do you want any taro? <br/>No thank you, not right now. <br/>Where is that creme brulee? <br/>Hey, big man, come here and sit in the shade. <br/>I just had a little coconut, and now I'm ready to do pig snare. Who wants to help? <br/>A pig snare? <br/>Sure. He comes out here every night, and he's about this tall. I got a good look at him. So I got a pig that comes down into our camp every night. I'm getting a little tired of him taunting me, so I want to go and catch that thing and make some pork chops. I figured this one, we bend it over that way. That way we won't really have to bend it that far, but when he lashes it, he'll be up. <br/>Rob is building a pig snare. I think because not only he's a little bit frustrated that we haven't got a pig, but I think Rob wants to secure his place in the tribe. If he doesn't win, you know, the next immunity challenge or the following immunity challenge, at least if he wins a pig, he can hold that up and say, "Hey, I'm a valuable member of this tribe. Don't vote me out." It might hold if this one was farther down. <br/>Whoa, it's all right. I got it. <br/>I catch a pig tonight, you win immunity, and I'm going to tell them, look, she's immune, I caught the pig. You can't get rid of me and not let me have any of my pig, you got to keep me, I got a pig. And then he'll pull, look at that release. <br/>Guys, we got mail! <br/>Guys, we got mail! <br/>Mail, at this hour, weird. <br/>Sounds like it's happening tonight. <br/>Happening tonight? <br/>Big wow. <br/>Big wow. All right, guys, ready? <br/>Yeah. <br/>"Race against the others until you're feeling hot. "The most basic skill of survival, show them what you've got. "Food, water and protection, most important in this game. "You may as well just pack your bags if you fail to strike flame." Guess what we're doing tonight. We're going to have to make fire tonight. <br/>We've got to make fire. <br/>That's what it sounds like. <br/>Yeah, we've got to make fire. Yet another curve ball. I've been busting my butt all day, you know, chopping wood, making a new pig snare and everything like that. These other people have been sleeping all day and resting. I wish I knew that. You know, I thought it was a day off. It's big stakes for me. I think I don't win, I could go. <br/>Probst: Welcome guys to Tribal Beach. First things first. Tammy, you want to give back that immunity necklace. Thank you. Once again, immunity, up for grabs. Okay. Here's the deal. Tonight's game is especially tough because it takes place in the dark. First, you're going to run to the end of the course and gather firewood from the perimeter. You will build a fire under a wok to heat oil to pop popcorn. Once you've popped one kernel of popcorn, you'll move to a final station where you will light your pyre from the bottom to ignite the top. You'll start your fire in a way you haven't done yet. Magnesium, flint and steel. First person to ignite the top of their pyre wins immunity, cannot be voted out, guaranteed three more days in this game. Everything clear? Take your spots. Wait for my go. Survivors ready! Go! <br/>Whoa. <br/>Probst: Think about stuff that's really going to ignite. Coconut husks work really well. There you go, V. V has fire. General's got fire. V and the General have fire. Everybody else is still working. That a way Sean. Keep it going. Kathy's got fire. Sean's got fire. <br/>You don't got any matches, do you, Jeff? <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Neleh's got fire. <br/>Whoo! How close are we to having popcorn? Very close, look at that oil, really heating up. Let's go, General, get one kernel to pop and you're moving on. <br/>I hear sizzle, man, I hear sizzle. Look at that, look at that. Look at that. It popped, right there. <br/>Probst: General, you got popcorn, baby. Moving on to the third station, you're done here. General's in the lead. It's getting close. Wok's heating up. There it is. V's got popcorn, moving to the final station. First one to ignite the top wins immunity. General's got a good healthy fire going, V. You'd better get that fire going fast. General's looking good, very close. Very close, General. V's catching up. They're neck and neck, guys. <br/>Come on, baby. Yeah! You're close, baby. <br/>Probst: General. Yeah! Nice work.Immunity, brother. Turn around here and let me put this on. <br/>Sanctuary. Probst: You cannot be voted out. Congratulations. <br/>You ain't going nowhere. I'm going to try my damnedest. [laughter] How tall do you think this is, you guys? Probably about 250 feet, maybe higher. <br/>No, about 100 feet. <br/>100 feet? <br/>Just won immunity, feeling a little relieved, knowing I'm definitely going to be here another three days. <br/>Who else gets this? <br/>It's like being in a torrential downpour and it's gorgeous. <br/>The win was very big for me, just lifted me up and bringing me back to life. I was feeling a little down, and now I'm feeling really good about myself again. That was refreshing. I'm definitely a little bummed that it looks like Tammy is on the way out. She's like a sister to me. I'd like to see if I could do something to save her. <br/>I think Tammy has a play for tonight. I just don't know what it is. I think it's something that's going to get pulled out of a hat and we're all going to come tumbling down. All right. <br/>Over. <br/>Hike, hike! <br/>Over, hike, hike! <br/>I'm not used to losing. I'm super competitive. And you know what? I'm not giving up on this game until I hear my name read at Tribal Council. <br/>I'm telling you something. That Tammy is waiting for any opening. <br/>Oh, Tammy's waiting for anything. She's like a pit bull. <br/>She's waiting there to take advantage of something. <br/>That's why I'm saying, you know, if she comes up with some plan, I can see her getting V over on her side. <br/>V has definitely flipped more than anybody in this game. Maybe Rob and Tammy could somehow convince Sean and V to join their pact. <br/>A few moments we get to have. If V and I hooked up with Tammy and Rob, point blank, it would put us in the final four. My thing is, I'm approaching you on this angle. Neleh got mad game. She's playing the girl next-door role to the hilt. It's important that V and I vote Neleh off. Because she's so young and because she has this angelic girl-next-door, everybody is being deceived by aww, aww, and not realizing the more sympathy you have, the stronger this girl gets. She talks a good game, let's go do this, let's go do this, but don't do much but sleep and take walks. <br/>Every now and then she'll turn around and pick up something and make it look like... See, you see exactly what I'm saying. <br/>It would be a sure bet if V and I hooked up with Tammy and Rob, but then again, it might not be a sure bet, because they may very well go to the other force, and say hey, look, these two tried to hook up with us and save their own ass. Then we're on the chopping block. <br/>I'm ready to end this game in a bang, baby. We are close. All right. So we'll see what happens. Okay. <br/>Probst: I will now bring in the two members of our jury. I'll remind you the jury is here merely to observe. This is the beginning of the shift in the game, when the power leaves those who are still in it and goes now to those who are out of it. So how you vote becomes very important in this game. Tonight I want to talk about what you are tired of, after 30 days. <br/>Neleh.A big part of it is that you are covered in dirt. You know, you wake up in the morning, there's dirt and no-nos stuck inside your eyes. It's just, it's absolutely disgusting, and I mean the nights are bad here. <br/>Probst: Kathy? <br/>I can't stay on the beach. For various reasons, it's the bugs, the monotony, it's the grime. And my skin is literally ready to fall off, I've got so many rashes and infections, it's disgusting. <br/>Probst: Paschal, what are you sick of out here? <br/>Just the daily grinds, the monotony, the same food, the same living conditions, the same everything. And the closer we get to the end, it seems the more difficult it becomes. <br/>Probst: On a scale of one to ten, how valuable was the reward of going to a cruise ship and being able to take a shower and get clean clothes and have a good meal? <br/>Seven million. Neleh and I sat on the deck of that ship and talked about it. There was nothing, nothing that I could have received that would have invigorated me more and made me feel better. It was absolutely amazing. <br/>Probst: Kathy, what was your reaction? Paschal and Neleh come back, not only did they have a shower, they're clipping their nails,. They're doing a little buff pad, I mean it was like they went to a spa. <br/>Hey, there is no doubt about it, I was jealous. I think all of us had a difficult time listening to the blow by blow description of Neleh's shower. But Paschal did an incredible job on that challenge, man, so I think when you win, you deserve it. And Neleh going, so be it. You know I wanted to get him really dirt the next day. <br/>Probst: General, you own immunity. If it made sense, you could assign that immunity to somebody else. Have you talked about that, is there somebody here you want to give that up to? Do you feel safe enough? <br/>No, I got to stay. <br/>Probst: It's time to vote. Neleh, you're first. <br/>Tammy, Tammy, you're one cool chick but lethal competition. Take it easy. <br/>You don't seem to pull your weight actually as much as everybody else pulls theirs. So that's why I'm voting for you tonight Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Tammy. Tammy. Vecepia. Vecepia. Two votes Tammy, two votes V. That's three votes Tammy. Tammy. That's four, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Tammy, the tribe has spoken. Well, you made it 30 days; I know you're having a hard time, but nobody ever said Survivor was going to be easy. Nine more days left. Hang in there. You guys can head back to camp. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor: Only six remain at Soliantu, and island life has taken its toll on all of them. <br/>We're just depleted energy wise, and it's really uncanny to see what's happening with our mental stability. <br/>Probst: And an event occurs that will shakeup the entire tribe. <br/>It takes an experience like this to realize what really is important in your life. <br/>Even though I knew tonight was coming, and it was my turn, it still sucks to be voted off. I've played this game exactly the way I said I was going to play it and I'm proud of the way I played it. This is the game of Survivor, the people that are left, I hope that they have it in them to last the rest of the time, because I'm not so sure they do.
