<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: Despite having three of the strongest  players in the game, including a former Olympic athlete, the Fang tribe lost  three challenges in a row. Fang is walking, literally walking! They thought they could turn things around by picking GC to be their leader. <br/>If I was volunteered, I'll take it. If they want me to roll with it, I mean, I'll do it. <br/>Probst: But he quit after one day. <br/>We don't need a damn leader. I'm younger than all y'all, so what I'm being the leader for? <br/>Probst: The Kota tribe was on a roll. They were hard-working and upbeat. <br/>I don't envision us losing ever. <br/>Probst: So it was a shock to everyone... Fang wins reward! ...when Fang finally won a challenge. (cheering) They sent Sugar to Exile Island...  Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God! (shrieks)  ...thinking she was so weak she'd never find the hidden immunity idol. <br/>Oh, my God, I found it. Okay, I'm going to cry. (laughs)  Probst: Sugar kept the idol secret from everyone except her closest ally Ace. At the next immunity challenge, Fang won again. (cheering) Fang wins immunity! In their first trip to Tribal Council, Kota demonstrated their tribe unity by  voting out their smallest and weakest player in a landslide. Paloma's lone ally was Kelly, who voted for Ace. Paloma, the tribe has spoken. 15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Well, that kind of sucked. I don't really want to do that anymore. <br/>I really didn't like that. <br/>Me, neither. <br/>We just got back from Tribal Council. Paloma got voted off. I definitely lost a partner in the game who I can, like, talk to about things. And now I'm worried about the chopping block. But things can change all the time. My strategy right now is I want Ace off. I just don't like Ace. <br/>How do you feel about Tribal? How was it for you? <br/>It was a bloody godawful experience. Tribal Council was probably one of the most un-pleasurable things I have done  in recent history. It was, uh, right there with my wisdom teeth being pulled. That was not fun going there. <br/>No. <br/>I didn't know she had that much pent-up animosity towards me. <br/>I didn't, either. <br/>I think Kelly voted for me, and, uh, she will be the next lamb to the  slaughter. (theme song playing) Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION  (hippopotamus grunts)  Do you think I could try cooking some sweet rice? <br/>Have you seen the rice? We're over halfway done. <br/>We-we should be eating one meal a day right now and... Uh, I will, I will  make my speech, and then I'm going to shut up, and you guys can decide. But we need to be eating one meal a day, period. We're all going to be hungry. That's why it's called Survivor. The rice, quite simply, is running out. Strategically, I know that Crystal, Kenny, and GC are not with me. They hadn't listened to a word I've said since I've been here. <br/>I'll catch up with you guys. Matty, Susie, and Dan, they're not my allies, but they're my friends. And I'm just not sure how to play it right now. <br/>I ain't never seen Dan go pick fruit a day since we've been here, and all of  a sudden, he going to go pick some fruit. <br/>Exactly. They're going to go talk right now. They got four r-right now. There's three of us here. <br/>That's four. <br/>And there's four there. So they could be trying to do, you know, something right now. All I know, it seem like the tightest three is right here. <br/>Those three alienated me from the beginning. <br/>Th-They alienate everybody. <br/>I could tell GC the sky is blue, and he's gonna argue with me. <br/>Matty's having a hard time with Crystal, and I'm having a hard time with  Crystal. <br/>She's hard for me to deal with. <br/>And Kenny, he-he's like Mini-Me to GC. <br/>And then GC is given and he accepts the role as leader, and he flails and he  gives it back. <br/>We have a cancer, and this cancer's name is GC. And at the right time, this cancer is going to have to be cut out. We are all totally on the same page with this. <br/>No matter what, Susie. <br/>No matter what. <br/>I finally feel like I've solidified my four with Dan, Randy, and Susie. And I really, truly feel that this alliance that I've-- we've created is  going to be solid for a while. Think it's going to carry me pretty far. <br/>We don't need to talk about this anymore. <br/>No. <br/>Just put it in. <br/>All that matters is the four of us. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Kota, come on in. Fang getting your first look at the new Kota. Paloma voted out at the last Tribal Council. You guys ready to get to it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Probst: You've been out here ten days, know each other pretty well. Now we're going to put that knowledge to use. Today, you are going to rank your tribe from top to bottom according to  importance in your tribe. One would be the highest ranking; you'll work your way down. Once you're finished, I'll have you take your spot according to rank on the  colored pedestal. Got a tally board for each of you. Don't unwrap these yet. You will fill these out in private. Find a spot on the beach, get started. <br/>Probst: All right, this is how you guys ranked yourselves in terms of  importance. The person that Kota ranked as the most important on their tribe is Marcus. <br/>I'm totally shocked to be ranked number one. I was just happy that they felt that way about me. On the other hand, are they going to start thinking that maybe that's a  threat that needs to be, uh, moved off to the side as quickly as possible? <br/>Probst: Person voted second-most important on the Kota tribe: Ace. Third: Bob. Fourth: Charlie. Fifth for the Kota tribe: Jacquie. Sixth: Corinne. The seventh: Sugar. Leaving Kelly as the least valuable member of the tribe. Kelly, how's it feel? <br/>It's interesting. Being the last one. I've never been the last picked ever, so it's kind of different. <br/>Kelly's devastated. "Why am I picked last? Why is everybody not kissing my ass?" 'Cause you're a whiny little cow,  and, um... you don't do anything. <br/>Probst: On the number one pedestal for Fang: Matty. Second on the Fang tribe: Dan. Third: Randy. Fourth: Crystal. <br/>What the hell? I'm out there busting my butt, and then they're going to rank me number four  after someone who can't even barely walk and barely do anything, and all he  does is sit around and fuss and curse everyone? I was very insulted when I saw that. <br/>Probst: Fifth for the Fang tribe: Ken. Sixth: GC. <br/>Wow. Kenny got picked before me? Damn, this is, this is not looking too good. (chuckles) Yeah, this is not looking too good for a pimp out here. <br/>Probst: Leaving Susie as the least valuable tribe member. So this is it. This is how you guys ranked yourselves. Marcus, any surprises to you on the Fang tribe? <br/>I'm surprised Randy is up as high as he is. I really thought that we'd see a girl in the top two or three on their tribe. So that comes as a surprise. <br/>Probst: Randy, you're getting a sneak peek inside the Kota tribe. What kind of insight do you take from this? <br/>I really don't think anything. <br/>Probst: Really? <br/>I mean, this shows friendliness; this shows physicality in, uh, challenges,  but it doesn't show a thing about who's hooking up with who. <br/>Probst: All right. Well, now you're going to take all this insight and put it to good use  because we are picking new tribes. <br/>What?! <br/>No, no, no. <br/>Oh, no. Oh, wow. <br/>Probst: Drop your buffs. <br/>No! (groaning)  I had it all perfect. Dan, Randy, and Susie and I solidified our foursome, and I was super content  with it. I was happy. I was comfortable with that foursome. And then Jeff's like, "We're going to switch teams." And I was just  like, "Oh, no." That was just such a buzz-kill. I didn't even want to hear that. <br/>Probst: Here's how it is going to work. Marcus and Matty, because you were voted the most important person in your  tribe, you will remain members of that tribe. You will be captains, and you will get us started on picking new tribes. Marcus take a spot on the Kota mat. Matty, take a spot on the Fong mat. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>Probst: Kota will choose first. Marcus, you're now going to choose somebody from the Fang tribe. Who are you going to select to be your first tribe member? <br/>I'm going to take Dan. <br/>Probst: Dan joins Marcus on the new Kota tribe. Matty, make your first selection. You're choosing somebody from Kota. <br/>I'm going to take Ace. <br/>Probst: Ace joins Matty on the new Fang tribe. All right, Dan. You are now choosing somebody from Kota. <br/>Charlie. <br/>Probst: Charlie joins his old teammate Marcus and his new tribe member, Dan. <br/>I am thrilled to be with Marcus. My biggest fear in this game is that Marcus and I would separate because we  have each other's backs, like... I just love Marcus. (laughing)  Probst: Ace, you are now choosing somebody from the Fang tribe. <br/>Since she beat me up so bad, Crystal, come on down. <br/>Probst: Crystal, first woman selected. Charlie, you are now choosing somebody from Fang. <br/>Randy. (clicking tongue)  Probst: Randy on the new Kota. <br/>Probst: Crystal, you are choosing somebody from the Kota tribe. <br/>I'm going to go with Jacquie. <br/>Probst: Jacquie joins Crystal, Matty, and Ace. Randy, you are now choosing somebody from the Kota tribe. <br/>Corinne. <br/>Probst: Corinne joins Marcus and Charlie, Dan, and Randy. Jacquie, you are now choosing somebody from the Fang tribe. <br/>I'm going to go with Ken. <br/>Probst: Ken joins Matty, Crystal, Ace, and Jacquie. All right, Corinne, your choice. Are you choosing somebody from Fang. You have only two choices: GC, who was ranked number six, or Susie, who is  ranked last. <br/>It doesn't matter who they pick; it's a game. <br/>Probst: All right, Corinne. I hope the information you're getting is good info. <br/>Well, I don't want to be the only girl, so we're going to take Susie. Come on over. <br/>Probst: Corinne chooses Susie, leaving GC as the last remaining member of  Fang. GC, nobody chose you. <br/>Well, it's cool. You know. It doesn't feel good. But the last few days have been pretty hard for me, and I think I probably  rubbed a few people the wrong way. <br/>Probst: All right, Ken, you're now making a selection. You're choosing between three remaining Kota members, Bob, Sugar, and Kelly. <br/>I don't know Kelly. <br/>No? <br/>Probst: Bob still left up there. Bob, a little surprised? You were ranked so high by your own tribe, and yet nobody's chosen you? Are you a diamond in the rough? Are they missing some gold here? <br/>Um... I think so, but that... You know, time will tell. <br/>Probst: All right, Ken, make your choice. <br/>Jeff, for myself, I've always been last picked sometimes and I know how it  feels to be left out, so I'm going to go with Kelly. I want to get to know her, and she's hot. (laughter)  Probst: That may be the most surprising decision in ten days out here, Ken. Susie, you're choosing between Bob, ranked the third most valuable tribe  member, or Sugar, ranked next to last. <br/>I'm going to go with Bob. <br/>Probst: Finally, Bob joins Susie, Marcus, Charlie, Corinne, Dan, and Randy. <br/>Probst: Kelly, you have one choice. <br/>G-Sizzle. <br/>G-Sizzle! Come back home. <br/>Probst: GC joins Kelly, Matty, Ken, Crystal, Ace, and Jacquie. The new Fang tribe, which leaves you, Sugar. <br/>What does that mean? <br/>Probst: You will go to Exile Island. <br/>Aah! <br/>Oh, no! <br/>Probst: You will remain on Exile until after the next Tribal Council. You will then join the tribe that loses a member, evening us up at 7-7. Ready to head to Exile? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Here is a map. Not that you don't know the way. <br/>Bye. <br/>Probst: It's going to be a long stay out there, Sugar. <br/>Bye. <br/>Probst: Kota, new tribe buffs. Fresh, clean. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Fang, new tribe buffs. All right, we have our new tribes. For some of you, this is a brand-new start. For others, it could mean the end of your game. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>You guys, this is your new home. Feel comfortable. <br/>Welcome hone, guys. <br/>You guys are really going to like it here. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I'm so happy. <br/>Look at this. <br/>This tribe has a completely different personality. If Matty was here, it would be, like, the perfect tribe. <br/>The new Kota tribe is four Kota members: Bob, Marcus, Corinne, and Charlie;  three old Fang members: Susie and Dan and me. If Kota loses the next challenge, I do think the original Kota will stick  together and pick one of the three Fang members off. If it's not me, I'll go along with it. If it is me, I'll burn the camp down. <br/>This is unbelievable. It's, like, the most comfortable thing I've sat on in a week. <br/>Bob works in his sleep, too. He wakes up every hour. <br/>Yeah, Bob wakes up in the middle of the night and builds stuff. He's going to build us some bunk beds, I think. <br/>Unbelievable. <br/>He's awesome, Bob. The Kota tribe has it together. They're just functioning really well. I see Bob is their worker, and I think Marcus and Corinne and Charlie, they  really appreciate that. So, my strategy right now at Kota is to just keep working hard at camp. And I'm hoping that they see that as a positive and say, "She's worth  keeping."  Comfort time! When I got to Exile, there was a choice between comfort and the clue. And I already have the idol, so I chose comfort. Home, sweet home. I walked up to my Sugar shack. It was like Christmas morning. There was pineapple and oranges and apples and coconut. Oh, my God. This is so good. (laughing) (sighs) This game is so crazy because I don't know what team I'm  going to be on when I get back. I'm hoping that I go back to Fang, so that I can be with Ace. And hopefully they'll vote off Kelly, and then I can come take her spot. I'm sure they will. They're not idiots. <br/>All right, guys. Welcome to Fang! <br/>I like it. <br/>This is our home. <br/>Is it different than your guys' house? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Really? <br/>I mean, the hut looks similar. <br/>This tribe switch is great for me. I still got four people of my original tribe, and I think it is great, you  know what I mean? I don't think I could be in a better position right now. <br/>If we walk around and pull ginger, you can cut the root and you can put it  right into the rice. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Same with the watercress. <br/>Oh, yeah, and ferns. <br/>We can't find the ginger. <br/>Oh, I can show you it. <br/>Oh! Thank you! Thank you! <br/>Yeah. <br/>Because you guys didn't really invite anybody else with you guys wherever you  went. <br/>Listening to Kelly talk, she felt like an outcast. She felt like she needed to belong somewhere, and maybe she really does belong  with Fang. <br/>I was starting to count down the days and the hours. <br/>Not much we can do, but...  Yeah. <br/>I don't know, it's so weird. They are just so fake. Like, I'm a salesperson. I know I can analyze people and, like, get along with all personalities. And even change my personality, and act like something sometimes. But, to them, it was just like, I would sit there and just, like, listen to  them. I definitely would rather jump ship and go with Fang than I would with old  Kota. 'Cause, you know what? They didn't even give me a chance. And I think Crystal and G-Sizzle and Ken have something going on. So, I definitely want to be a part of that because they overrule all the  votes. <br/>What you see. (imitating): "Cool, awesome!" "What's up? Like, cool!"  Oh, he's got two. <br/>Oh, he pimp daddy. <br/>Sweet! <br/>He's pimp daddy Ace. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, my God. Duh. My girl. <br/>Uh, cha-ching. <br/>Okay, it can be done. <br/>That's money in the bank. <br/>The numbers are here. <br/>When I saw Kelly on that mat and she was the last one picked, I knew I could  sway her to my side because she did not get along with Kota. Oh, yeah, she's also hot. There you go. <br/>I know. I'm so happy that I get to, like, talk, and you guys, like, talk back. <br/>Right now, I am only using her for a vote. <br/>We got tree mail! <br/>Oh, my God. It's a lacrosse stick. <br/>Oh, crap. <br/>Is that a ball? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Aw! <br/>"Practice, practice, shoot and toss. Like water polo meets lacrosse, Time to show them who is boss, You can never  afford an immunity loss." I really am trying physically to try my best,  but, man, this game takes a toll on a 47-year-old woman like me. (laughs) It just does. <br/>You use your left hand and your right. It will go faster. Here, somebody else can try. <br/>I don't know that Randy and Susie can really pull their weight when it comes  to the challenges themselves. I think it will be really hard to put Randy out before Susie, but it's  certainly not out of the question. Susie is doing a great job around camp. And if Randy has a poor performance on a challenge and he's not really doing  much around camp, shoot, I would rather keep Susie around. The question will really be, "How does Randy perform when it comes time  to do the challenges?" (all laughing)  Randy. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: First things first. GC, take back immunity. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will each have a raft and a paddle. On my go, I'll toss a ball into the water. You will race to gain possession of the ball. Using your paddles, you will pass the ball from one tribe mate to another  until you are close enough that you can toss the ball into your opponent's  goal, scoring a point for your tribe. First tribe to three wins immunity, is safe in this game. Losers go to Tribal Council where the fourth person will be voted out. Make sense? <br/>ALL: Yes. <br/>Probst: We'll get you in the boats. We'll get started. All right, here we go. For immunity. It takes three points to win. Survivors ready? Go! These boats are not easy to control. Maneuvering is going to be half the battle. Your goal is to pass from one tribe mate to another until you are close  enough to score. <br/>That's my girl! <br/>Probst: Jacquie going to get to the ball first for Fang. Jacquie has it, loses it quickly. Jacquie struggling now to get back to it. Marcus taking his time, scoops it up easily. Ace in the goalie position. Marcus just moving it down, nobody even attacking Marcus. Crystal just watching. <br/>Get it, Ken! <br/>Probst: Kelly not doing anything. Kenny can't do anything. Marcus passes in closer to Randy. Randy's got it. Going to take a shot at the goal, and he scores! Just like that. <br/>Take that! Let's go! Come on! <br/>Probst: Kota on the board. <br/>That's a boy, Randy! <br/>Probst: Here we go. Kota leads, 1-zip. Playing to three. Survivors ready? Go! Matty out quickly for Fang. <br/>Come on, Matty! Get to it! <br/>Probst: Marcus fighting to get there first. Kelly making no progress. Ace now out of the goalie spot using his hands. He's now out on the course. Marcus going to get there first for Kota. Marcus with a nice little pass to himself. Marcus like he's done this before. <br/>Kelly, get up there, too! <br/>Kelly! Kelly, the ball! <br/>Come on, Kelly! Get to it! <br/>Get over there, Randy. <br/>Randy's open! <br/>Take your time. Take your time. <br/>Probst: Kelly not doing much. Marcus passes down to Randy. He's got a free goal if he can get to it. <br/>Randy, go! <br/>Probst: Nobody on the Fang goal! How does that happen? <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Kota scores their second point. <br/>Nice, guys, nice! <br/>Good job! <br/>Probst: Fang could not make that easier! <br/>I can't control the boat. <br/>Probst: Here we go. Kota leads 2-zip. It only takes three to win. Survivors ready? Go! Marcus once again out quickly for Kota. Ace racing to get possession. Marcus once again gets to the ball first. <br/>Nice, Ace, get to it! <br/>Probst: Trying to control it. Loses it to Ace. Ace having trouble getting back to it. Kelly just hanging back. Marcus tosses it between Kenny and Crystal and now Marcus is going to pass  Kenny. <br/>Come on, Kenny, go! <br/>Probst: Kenny virtually useless in this challenge. <br/>Ace, yeah! <br/>Atta, boys! <br/>Probst: Ace coming to get in on this. <br/>Marcus, do it! <br/>Watch out. Ace is behind you. <br/>Probst: No hands! <br/>Let's go, Marcus! <br/>Give it to me, man. <br/>Probst: Marcus tosses to Randy down close. Randy's got a shot on goal. <br/>Randy, go for it! <br/>You've got this, Randy. <br/>Probst: This could do it. No, just short. <br/>Yeah, Matty! <br/>Probst: Dan and Matty fighting for that ball right at the goal. No, Matty with a great block! Dan, you're out of your boat. You're not in it until you're back in your boat. <br/>Get to that corner! <br/>Oh, my God! Go, Randy! <br/>Probst: Ace knocks it out of Randy. Now Ace is out of his boat. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Randy scores for Kota! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Kota wins immunity. <br/>Yes, yeah! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: One of the most lopsided challenges thus far. Kota, congratulations. Immunity and no Tribal Council. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Fang, without question, one of the worst performances I've seen at a  challenge. I got nothing for you except a date with me tonight at Tribal Council where  today's performance will cost somebody a shot at a million dollars. That's what you have to figure out this afternoon. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you at Tribal. Kota, congratulations. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>(tribal chanting) (yawning fiercely)  The immunity challenge was so much fun. It was like we were legless chickens racing against sleek weasels and losing  badly along the way. <br/>It seemed like the plan failed from the very start. <br/>Kenny, you okay? <br/>Yeah, I mean, I was...  Kenny, you sucked out there. <br/>I'm sorry. <br/>Kenny, you were stuck in the same spot. <br/>I don't understand how that worked. Like, 'cause I kept on turning around in circles. <br/>That was bad. That was bad, Kenny. <br/>You were pretty good, Jacquie. <br/>It's hard to play defense in that game. Should've, could've, would've. <br/>Over it. <br/>Originally we were thinking about voting for Ace or Jacquie tonight, but  judging by the way that Kelly performed today, Kelly's going home tonight is  what I'm thinking. Um, I'm going to talk to the others. I'm going to talk to Kenny and Crystal, and I'm sure everybody will be fine  with voting Kelly out tonight. <br/>So, G, what do you think? <br/>I don't know. I think, uh... I think we should definitely keep Ace. He's, uh, you seen him today. Yeah, I mean, um, but I think, I mean, maybe we should switch it to Kelly,  man. She kind of has a bad attitude about stuff and she... Jacquie did at least  all right today. Are you all cool with that? <br/>I'm good with Kelly. I'll put it out. <br/>I don't want to lose no more. <br/>The dangerous thing about that is, if, if Sugar has the immunity idol, I  think she'll be more than likely to give it to Ace than to Jacquie. She won't give it to Kelly. <br/>That's the only flip side. <br/>And who knows if she even has it. <br/>I know. Like, voting Kelly tonight, it would be a risk. <br/>Yeah, if we vote off Kelly tonight...  It would be a risk. <br/>The deal was, whoever lost the immunity challenge, ends up picking up Sugar. And, unfortunately, that's us. She could have the immunity idol and the last thing we want is for Ace, Sugar  and Jacquie to become the power in this tribe. So, what's the deal? <br/>No. <br/>Not Kelly? Jacquie? <br/>Yeah, Jacquie. <br/>Because if Sugar comes here with the immunity idol, it'll take...  She'll share it among those three. <br/>With Jacquie. <br/>She was close to Jacquie and Ace. <br/>Which means they'll have three. <br/>I don't want him to have any kind of power in our tribe, not even three. The closest he'll have is two. <br/>Nah, tell us how you feel. <br/>I think Kelly. I think Kelly's the weakest link. We were gonna vote out Sue next. What's the difference in Sue and Kelly? Not a damn thing. <br/>The difference is, uh, Sugar may have the immunity idol. Ace, Sugar, and Jacquie-- those three right now is real deadly. <br/>You cool? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I was talking to Crystal, GC, and Kenny. So I go... so I go, "We can't rid of the strong people; we can't get rid  off the strong people; there's no way," and he started to believe me. And then they wanted... then they were talking about taking out you, and I  was, like, "No, no, no, we can't take out Jacquie, she's too strong,  she's too strong, she's too strong," but they're, like, worried that you  and Ace are allied, so when what's-her-face comes back that you and him are  gonna be allied...  Matty told me that everybody assumes that Sugar's gonna have the idol coming  back 'cause she'll be out there for four days now. And they all want to vote me out. I'm feeling totally on the outs right now. I'm really, really nervous. <br/>I work off my ass off in the challenges. <br/>People are scared. <br/>But you guys would still help, like...  No, it's not that. It's just, like...  I want to be with you guys. 'Cause I'm on the outskirts of anything, so if I try even to join with Ace  and Sugar, I know they're not gonna bring me to the end. <br/>Jacquie seems very genuine. After I had a talk with Jacquie, I kind of wanted to go take out Kelly before  Jacquie. If we make the wrong choice right now, it will hurt really bad later. So my mind is not made up right now. I can try to vote for Kelly tonight, but... it's not gonna do anything. You really need to talk to Crystal. <br/>It sucks. So, I just... like, I was, like, "Well, is there any way that I could  get in, like, a tight alliance with you guys," you know? <br/>We thought you and... you and Ace were fairly close. <br/>We never had an alliance. It would be awesome if we had, like, a really strong united...  You did a... you did a hell of a job today. <br/>I worked my ass off, and I, like, actually want to be here. <br/>Yeah, you played your ass off. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I was, like, "Damn."  I want to be here so bad...  Jacquie is a nervous wreck. Jacquie was just pretty much begging and pleading with me, "Crystal,  please keep me in the game. I've tried so hard. I want to be here."  ...close with GC and Kenny? <br/>Yeah. <br/>'Cause you guys need a fourth. <br/>Yeah, that's the thing. <br/>I want to be the fourth so bad, please... (laughs)  And the whole time she's talking to me, she's-she's welling up and she is  pulling at my heartstrings. You know, because I'm, like, "Damn, this girl played her ass off today,  and maybe she really does want to be here."  I would be with you guys till the end. So anyways, I just wanted to talk to you 'cause I didn't get to talk to you. And I'm, like... I'm, like, "Kenny, I feel like... (continues indistinctly)   As of right now, I don't know what to do because I need someone on my team  that's gonna fight... and that's gonna work hard, you know, and that's what  she is. *  Probst: Welcome to another Tribal Council starring the Fang Tribe. GC, it's got to be getting old. <br/>I like to see you, Jeff. But I don't like seeing you under these circumstances. You know, it's good to have the strongest team as possible. Anytime you lose somebody, it just hurts your team even more. <br/>Probst: Matty, is that the criteria right now: Keep this tribe as strong as  possible? <br/>Yeah, according to Matty, it is. And, uh, after today's performance, I was completely embarrassed. So yeah, I want to keep this tribe as strong as possible. <br/>Probst: Kenny, let's talk about the switch. You lose Dan, Randy, and Susie, but you gain Jacquie, Ace, and Kelly. Can you trust them? <br/>Um, right now, in three days, it's really hard to trust anybody, Jeff. You have to build trust from the beginning and see who they really are, and  that's how you trust somebody. <br/>Probst: Matty, do you trust Ace now, as a Fang member? <br/>I don't know if I trust Ace, but I want Ace on my side. He's a powerful contributor, and I want him on my team right now. <br/>Probst: Ace, should they trust you guys? <br/>You know, Ken's completely right. Until we prove ourselves, it's hard to be, like, "Trust me, trust me,  trust me," even if we're telling the complete truth. Right now you go and try and make us as strong as possible and just do what's  best for the tribe. <br/>Probst: Jacquie, how frustrating is it to come from a tribe that really had  it together, to come to this tribe, where it's almost as if there's something  in the water? You just... dissolve. <br/>When I came to the tribe, I thought we would have, like, awesome teamwork. Like, I thought we were for sure gonna win any challenge over Kota Tribe, and  I was working my butt off. Like, I was hoping that we'd win. I definitely didn't want to be here. <br/>Probst: Kelly, you haven't been with this tribe very long. Concerned at all that it's you tonight? <br/>Well, I'm definitely concerned, but there's other Fang members that clearly  were weak today. <br/>Probst: Who's weaker than you? <br/>Kenny was weaker than me today, and Crystal was weaker than me today. <br/>That's just one challenge; I'm not weaker than her. <br/>Exactly. But it's just, like... I'm just saying that, like, I was moving in the  situation and I was, like, going after it. <br/>I didn't just sit and watch. I tried to move that rowboat as fast as and as best as I could, but it wasn't  moving. So I was in the game. I just wasn't participating as much as I normally do. That just wasn't my cup of tea today. <br/>Probst: It was really clear, the three people who contributed. It was Jacquie, Ace, and Matty. Ace, if this group is truly trying to keep its tribe strong-- even though  you're a former Kota member-- do you feel safe? <br/>No. I'm scared. But, like, I mean, I don't think it would be the best strategic move on their  part to knock me out now, just 'cause I can help, physically, mentally as  possible. <br/>Probst: Jacquie, if the truth is, this tribe wants to keep this tribe strong,  you are arguably one of the strongest people, men or women. <br/>I know, but I'm so nervous. I-I don't feel safe at all because all of us Kota members are in the minority. I mean, there's only three of us, and I just feel like I could easily just  get picked off. <br/>Probst: Kenny, if the four Fang vote together tonight, who should be most  worried? <br/>I would say Kelly or Jacquie would have to be worried tonight because we do  need physical players on this tribe to start winning challenges. So either one of them. *  Probst: All right, it's time to get to the vote. Matty, you're up. *  (whispers): Kel, you voted for me last time. There's nothing like returning the favor. <br/>(whispers): Sorry. <br/>It probably would have been smarter to keep you, but this is how it is. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. *  Probst: If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you wanted to play it, now  would be the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out'll be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote. Jacquie. Kelly. One vote Jacquie; one vote Kelly. Kelly. Two votes Kelly; one vote Jacquie. Jacquie. We're tied. Two votes Kelly; two votes Jacquie. Jacquie. That's three votes Jacquie; two votes Kelly. Fourth person voted out of Survivor: Gabon: Jacquie. That's four; that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. * Jacquie, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Well, one thing is for certain: Sugar will be returning from Exile Island and  will become the newest member of the Fang Tribe. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. * Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION Captioned by Media  Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org  Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Next time on Survivor: (indistinct talking)  (whispers): Quiet! <br/>...Mother Nature pays a visit... (elephant trumpeting) ...and GC goes missing...  ...right before a challenge. <br/>BOTH: GC! <br/>So, I just got voted out of Survivor, and I'm so upset. I'm... I... kind of thought coming, if I would have stayed in more one round,  I feel like I could have made it all the way in this game. So they were probably smart in saving their own butts. But I'll be waiting for when they get kicked off. (chuckles)
