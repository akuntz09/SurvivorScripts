<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor: Michael provided fish and  took his leadership role to new heights. <br/>Michael: Dear God, thanks for making me the leader of the  troops. <br/>Kimmi: Mike thanks God for making him the leader of the  tribe. I don't know when he was anointed, but apparently my back was  turned. <br/>Jeff: At Ogakor, Kel, the loner, was the one serious about  fishing. <br/>Kel: We do need to get some fish. <br/>Keith: Our plan for getting food is, uh... we don't really  have a good plan, actually. <br/>Jeff: And Jerry muscled in on Chef Keith's domain. <br/>Jerri: There's a bunch more things we can have than rice  and I'm ready to start making some of them. <br/>Keith: She if she wants to cook some tortillas for  breakfast, I think that's fantastic. No worries me. <br/>Jeff: Rodger struggled with the reward challenge. <br/>Rodger: Water is not my finest point. <br/>Kimmi: Come on, Rodger! <br/>Jeff: At the immunity challenge, Kimmi, the vegetarian,  secured a victory for Kucha by swallowing a mangrove worm, sending Ogakor to  Tribal Counsel were Kel was voted out. <br/>Jeff: Kel, the tribe has spoken. 14 people are left. Tonight, one more will go. Tonight, one more will go. game is about the million dollars, but you need to take small  steps along the way to get there. And some of the small steps along the way to get there are  eating, because none of us are going to win the million dollars if we don't  have protein in our bodies and we can win the challenges. You guys, there's more food to be had that we haven't explored  yet. We still don't have food as a priority in this camp. <br/>Rodger: What's your chances of catching a pig? <br/>Jeff V.: Pig hunting, since we haven't seen, like, an  abundance of them, you know, there's like one out there. <br/>Rodger: Or any. <br/>Jeff V.: You know what I mean? We just walk around and hope that during day we run into this  big pig the size of a table. Mike wants to go out four hours a day and look for food because  Mike is hungry. Nobody else is up for that. <br/>Michael: I am going to find something that's alive that we  are going to kill. I am very, very determined to get a pig. They got to drink sometime and there's got to be tracks  somewhere and I'm going to ambush one. Hey, Jeff, where's that spear you made? <br/>Jeff V.: I didn't finish it. But if you're going to use it for a spear, then...  Michael: Once I see a pig, it's going to be a, you know,  an incredible act of exertion to try and get. But I'm going to build a spear with the with the knife on the  end, and then I'm going to run one down, and I'm going to get as close as I  can. And I'm just going to kind of, you know, figure it out from  there. <br/>Elisabeth: We should be looking for tracks right now. <br/>Alicia: This isn't about running out looking for a  hardcore hunter. This is about doing something that's realistic. That is not realistic. <br/>Jeff V.: Mike, I'm a little worried you're going to lose  that knife. <br/>Michael: And I'm glad you brought that to my attention,  and I will absolutely, positively not lose this knife. <br/>Jeff V.: I hope he loses our knife, just to give a  valuable reason to go off on the bastard. <br/>Elisabeth: We have one knife, and that one knife, it might  as well be food, but he wants to go and spear a pig. Really, have we seen a pig? We haven't seen a pig. I haven't seen a pig. Believe me, if I see a pig, I'll want to eat it, but to just go  spear just because you want to come back with one or your stick and be like  "rah, rah"? I don't know. <br/>Michael: This is a pig killer. <br/>Jeff V.: The spear. The spear, the stupid spear. "I'm going to go catch pigs." And he takes our knife  and our rope. That's classic Mike. He's an idiot. I want to see your pig. Go get me a pig. [ chuckling]  Tina: To be honest, I didn't [ chuckling]  Tina: To be honest, I didn't expect this adventure to be  this hard. I find myself just craving food. Doritos. I want a bag of Doritos more than anything in the world. <br/>Colby: We haven't had any meat in a week now, and the lack  of protein hasn't taken its toll yet, but it's going to. <br/>Maralyn: I think I'm going to go check for messages. There it is. Oh, late aboriginal fathers, be kind to us. I haven't opened it yet. "It's time to rise to the top or make a big flop on your  shoulders will rest the tribe's fate, for the food you've been wishing, you  only get in damn fishing, so try not to get crushed by the wake."  Jerri: Sure as hell to be some fishing line. Oh, my God. I think the main thing that's been keeping us from getting fish  is our fishing line. So this is a huge reward today. <br/>Amber: I'm worried about running out of food and running  out of rice. And we've been trying to eat it sparingly, but...  Maralyn: You got to eat. <br/>Amber: ...it's going to run out sooner or later. And I would love to catch a fish out there or something. <br/>Keith: It's going to be physical, no matter had you look  at it. But what we're trying to decide is if it's a group effort or it  depends on only one person. And if we have to choose one person, well, it makes no sense not  to choose, uh, Colby. He's the strongest, my God. You're the strongest. <br/>Colby: Yeah, I saw you throw that one up real quick. <br/>Keith: You got 20 years on me. <br/>Maralyn: A cowboy can handle any challenge. <br/>Tina: He would die before he would fail us. <br/>Colby: I would like to think that, win or lose on this  deal, my stock wouldn't fluctuate at all. And people can say, "Colby, don't worry about it. We don't want to put any pressure on you if you don't. If you don't pull through, it's no big deal." But internally,  I don't think that's the case. <br/>Jeff: Good morning, guys. Today we got a great challenge. Before we get to it, though, I want to show you the reward. It's an outback fishing package, complete with line, hooks,  lures and a net. You got your nylon. Now that we know what we're playing for, here's the challenge. It tests your strength, balance and endurance. The object is for both tribes to get all these buckets of water  loaded onto the shoulders of the other tribe's strongest member. The one who holds the buckets the longest without falling or  quitting wins. Each tribe is going to select one person to be the water bearer. It should be your strongest person. You're also going to have a person who is your loader. This person's going to be loading the buckets of water onto the  shoulders of your water bearer. So when you get out there, Ogakor will take the water from Kucha  and vice versa, and you will load it onto your water bearer. The rest of the people are going to transport the water out  there, and you're going to do so with one of the beams across your shoulders,  a bucket full of water on either side, and you'll make your way across the  balancing beams. If you fall, you got to start over. You want as much water in your buckets as you can handle because  your water is going on the opposing tribe's water bearer. Ogakor, you've chosen Colby to be your water bearer. Kucha, you've chosen Michael. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Ogakor! Ogakor! Ogakor! <br/>Go, Kucha! <br/>Rodger: Hang on, Liz. <br/>Go, Kucha! <br/>Rodger: Hang on, Liz. Get your balance. [ indistinct conversations]  That a girl. No worries. <br/>Rodger: Take your time. Do your turn. [ cheering]  All right, Elisabeth. Yeah, girl. <br/>Keith: No. No. No. <br/>All right, Kimmi. Good job. <br/>Good job. Good job. <br/>Jerri: Damn it! <br/>Rodger: All right, Elisabeth. Way to go. <br/>Michael: Keep it going, Kucha. <br/>That away, Maralyn. Good job. <br/>Tina: That a way, Mad Dog. [ indistinct conversations] [ cheering]  Come on, Jeffrey, you got it, buddy. <br/>Jeff: You guys run out of buckets, it's endurance. <br/>Maralyn: Well, take good care of you tonight, cowboy. <br/>Don't even think about that one. <br/>Colby: This sucks. This sucks. <br/>Jeff: Colby and Michael, you guys now have all the  buckets. That means you're each holding more than 400 pounds of water. Whoever holds on the longest wins. <br/>Let's go, Mike! [ screams]  Elisabeth: Let them bring it on. You can take ten more, Mike. You're the man! Whoo-hoo! [ various shouts]  We believe in you, Mike! [ various shouts of encouragement]  Jeff: Hold on. of encouragement]  Jeff: Hold on. No decision. <br/>Elisabeth: Great job, Mike. Great job! <br/>Jeff: 66 buckets, both these guys took on their shoulders. Michael's pole broke before anybody quit. That means there's no winner-- so now you guys are going to do a  runoff. We're going to do a five-minute timed race. The tribe that gets the most buckets on the other tribe's water  bearer's shoulders wins this. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Nicely done. <br/>That a girl. <br/>Jeff: You got four minutes. Eight buckets Ogakor, six buckets Kucha. We're all even at ten. Two minutes. Kucha, 14. Ogakor, 12. 20 seconds. Ogakor up by two. <br/>Hang tough. Hang tough. Make it there, Kimmi. <br/>Jeff: Five, four, three, two, one. Ogakor! [ cheering]  Maralyn! <br/>Michael: Let's get out of here. I don't want to stay here anymore. <br/>Tina: I can't wait to get the food you don't have to work  your butt off so to hard to get. I mean, we have done fantastic on a small amount of food. You get food in us, and we're going to be unstoppable. <br/>Colby: Winning this competition means a lot more to us  than just bringing home a bag of fishing supplies. These are the days when it comes down to morale, and the mental  edge going into this. And we're three and one now. The stats are pretty good for us. I certainly don't think this answers everything. We still got to catch the fish. The fish aren't going to jump into our camp. <br/>Mitchell: At the time, I didn't think that reward  challenge was very important because something told me there really wasn't a  lot of fish out here. And it sucks that they didn't give us the fish, they give us the  means to catch the fish. <br/>Amber: You have one. I saw it. <br/>Jerri: Yes, I did. Whoa! <br/>Mitchell: That is awesome. <br/>Amber: I don't know what part we can touch that he won't  slice us. <br/>Jerri: Okay. All right. <br/>Amber: I'm proud of you. <br/>Mitchell: Good job. <br/>Jerri: I got it off the hook. I couldn't stop smiling. Keith said there were no fish. He said, "There's no fish out there." Him and Kel both  were saying that for days and days. Holy... They were practically jumping in the boat. <br/>Mitchell: Chef Keith, you're going to be proud of us. <br/>Keith: Here we go now. We need the fish gutted and scaled. When they came back with fish, they immediately said, "Oh,  where's the chef?" The "chef" word's never been used before. <br/>Mitchell: Check that out. <br/>Keith: As a chef, my strategy was could come in here and  create just spectacular dinners and meals, and until now, we've had zero luck  at doing anything from the rivers or from the floor, for that matter. <br/>Amber: Today is day seven, and we have caught our first  fish, so actually, that's not too bad. It did take us a week, but hey, it's better than two weeks. <br/>Keith: How did I know that once the fish is caught, I'd be  the guy filleting these? <br/>Amber: You're doing that really well. <br/>Colby: Especially with a dull knife. He's doing exceptionally well. <br/>Mitchell: Yeah, really. <br/>Jerri: I think right now, everybody's pretty happy that  Keith is there to cook the fish that we've been catching. I know sometimes he says things to other people that kind of rub  them the wrong way, but I'm probably the one who gets irritated with him the most. I'm aware of that. <br/>Keith: Here we go. We'll just bread those in the flour, crush up the salt a little  bit. Put the salt on it and bread it with the flour. We just don't have oil, but it'll be okay. <br/>Jerri: I say we don't waste the flour. <br/>Colby: The most tension in the tribe seems to be between  Jerri and Keith. With the cooking and everyone responding well to her cooking, [  whistles] that put them on a level playing field there, and so there's not  really a power struggle yet, but it could definitely come to that point. <br/>Maralyn: Keith, we're all hovering over you like a bunch  of greedy sharks. <br/>Keith: Like I'm doing a cooking class. <br/>Colby: Even when Keith was over filleting the fish, I  noticed there were several eyes paying attention, and what that tells me is  that his stock didn't go up at all. All he did was basically play the role of instructor on how to  cook fish. <br/>Mitchell: Ooh, it looks a little bit like a fish Friday. <br/>Colby: Oh, it smells so good. <br/>Tina: Yes, it does, indeedy. <br/>Amber: I can't wait to try it. <br/>Keith: Maralyn. <br/>Mitchell: After a week of rice...  Maralyn: Oh, wow! Thank you. Oh, yes. <br/>Colby: Keith, I am so excited. <br/>Tina: That's good. <br/>Keith: You like that? <br/>Tina: Yeah. The fish that Keith made was excellent. That was like a blessing 'cause we were starving. We were so hungry. <br/>Mitchell: Mmm. So his first meal wasn't that great, but his first meal of fish  was fantastic. <br/>Amber: Oh, my God, it is so good. <br/>Keith: Tonight's dinner was definitely a success. <br/>Jerri: Oh, my God. <br/>Keith: Since cooking the fish, I think my stock's gone up  a good amount. I think the team has been pretty excited about what I've been  able to do for them. <br/>Mitchell: It is so good. I've never had such a great meal. But you know what? Jerri could do that, I could even do that. So having a chef out here isn't as crucial as he may think,  because we don't have a lot to work with. <br/>Kimmi: I'm usually on top of the water. I filled up eight jugs this morning, and now I refilled up...  this is the second one, so now I've done ten jugs of water. <br/>Elisabeth: Are you all right, Kimmi? <br/>Kimmi: Yeah. It's a lot of work because you've got to boil this crocodile  creek water before you can drink it. You got to go down and fill the big jug and then go up, boil the  water, let the water cool, put it in the big container. I mean, it doesn't seem like you're contributing a lot because  it's gone, as soon as it's there, it's gone. I got to go tend to the water. <br/>Rodger: I have noticed the amount of work that Kimmi has  been doing. And it seems to be a whole lot more than really just about anybody  else. She's really worried that she's going to be the next one to go. <br/>Kimmi: I sometimes feel vulnerable because I don't have a  tight, tight bond with somebody that could be pulling for me in my corner. Yeah, that might be a bad thing because I might be just like,  "Oh, easy target, pick Kimmi off." This means that I boiled  everything in this jug. <br/>Michael: Really? <br/>Alicia: Every job and task that Kimmi takes on in this  camp can be taken over by somebody else, for sure. <br/>Kimmi: Kentucky? <br/>Rodger: Yes, ma'am, what? Do you have lotion? You all good? <br/>Rodger: Yeah, I just put some on a little while ago,  thanks. <br/>Jeff V.: Well, there's sort of a little battle between  Kentucky Joe and Kimmi. Some of the people in the tribe feel that we will be stronger  without Kentucky Joe. <br/>Rodger: I'm going to try to catch some fish this morning. Make a new line. <br/>Elisabeth: I know in the beginning there was talk of  voting Rodger off and I tried really hard to rally people not to do it just  'cause I feel strongly for him. <br/>Alicia: Kentucky Joe, though he's not a strong member of  this tribe as far as challenges are concerned, he knows what he's doing  outside. <br/>Rodger: If I can draw them, maybe I'll be able to catch  one this time. I always heard that the best place to catch them is where a  stream runs into a river. I was out here looking for sinkers to make a new fishing pole  with, and I found a little rock out here about that tall shaped like a heart. <br/>Elisabeth: He said here you go. What's that look like? And I said, "a heart." He said, "You take that  with you, give it to your boyfriend when you get back." And he said,  "You just know I care." And it just... it just touched me. Thanks a lot. <br/>Rodger: You're welcome. Me and her, it just seemed like we hit it off right off the bat. <br/>Elisabeth: You're so sweet. <br/>Rodger: Well, thank you. You're a sweet little gal, too, I tell you what. Your parents got a lot to be proud of with you. <br/>Alicia: Elisabeth said she won't vote off Kentucky Joe,  and she protects him. <br/>Elisabeth: It matters so much to me that he's around, so  I'm not writing his name down. Uh-uh. I will not spell that man's name. name. <br/>Tina: Hey, you, girly girl. <br/>Maralyn: Hello. <br/>Tina: I just followed your voice. <br/>Maralyn: Was it that loud? <br/>Tina: Maralyn, she's kind of like our little song bird and  our little cheerleader in our camp, so Maralyn and I have bonded more so than  I have with any of the other people. It might be our ages, it might be that we just kind of took up  for one another. Mad Dog? Nothing hurts Mad Dog? <br/>Maralyn: Tina is a fabulous woman. She is a star. I trust Tina the most. Um, I do not trust Jerri. <br/>Colby: You like crunchy peanut butter or creamy? <br/>Jerri: Crunchy. <br/>Colby: Got to have crunchy. <br/>Jerri: Yeah. <br/>Colby: Black coffee or cream and sugar? <br/>Jerri: Cream and sugar. <br/>Amber: There could be something going on between Jerri and  Colby. I mean from the very first day, she told me how cute she thought  he was. And at first she didn't think that he liked her. And I was are like, "Jerri, it's only the second  day."  Jerri: I'd really like it if Colby and I got together. He's exactly my type, plus, he's a cowboy and I'm such a sucker  for cowboys. <br/>Colby: Cake or ice cream? <br/>Jerri: Oh, cake. <br/>Colby: Oh... I dig ice cream. Oh, Jerri, Jerri and I are getting along great. Every day we have more fun flirting with each other and seeing  how far we can kind of push it. Chocolate chip cookie or oatmeal raisin? <br/>Jerri: Chocolate chip. <br/>Colby: That wasn't really a fair competition. Oatmeal raisin never stood a chance in that battle. <br/>Keith: Oh, I think Jerri is legitimately attracted to  Colby. But I'm sure that strategic play is involved, there's no  question. <br/>Colby: You don't have to give me a massage...  Jerri: That's all right, though. I really, I don't mind, especially after today, what you did to  your back. <br/>Keith: I think Jerri's approach is just a lot of... she  wants to really feel important. She's already got Colby on her side, but she gets on his side  rubbing his back and, you know, nuzzling at night, you know, that whole  thing, sharing the blanket, all that kind of stuff. So it's natural for Colby just to gravitate and a little smoke  screen goes up and so he doesn't necessarily see certain things. Or maybe he does and I'm just not aware of it. [ Colby moans, Jerri laughs]  Colby: At this point, I'm not sure if Jerri has ulterior  motives. Jerri is very capable of deceiving me or anyone else in the  tribe. And maybe she's not. Maybe I'm wrong, but, uh, I still can't let my guard down. <br/>Jerri: Relax. If it came down to me having to vote for Colby.... I would. <br/>Alicia: This is spear grass. See how tall that is? <br/>Jeff V.: Yeah, that's definitely spear grass. <br/>Alicia: That is spear grass. <br/>Jeff V.: Alicia and I, we went for that foraging walk  together intentionally. I've thought a lot about the voting, and I wanted to be able to  get away with her and just have her think about the future and who would be  the most valuable to have with us in a final four, that we could beat. You and I committed to each other for that final four. <br/>Alicia: Right, because the truth of the matter is, I feel  like you're the only one that I really trust, at this point. Wow! Look at the size of that one. <br/>Jeff V.: That is a major spider. <br/>Alicia: Jeff and I are constantly scheming and planning  about how this thing should go. <br/>Jeff V.: Now, Elisabeth can't be in the final four. <br/>Alicia: She can't be because she'll make it to the end. <br/>Jeff V.: No. And I don't think Nick can be either. We talked about, you know, who we're going to vote for now, who  we're going to vote for next time, who we trust, who we don't trust. <br/>Alicia: Nick flies under the radar. <br/>Jeff V.: Nick flies very much under the radar, and Nick is  a total player. I don't trust him as far as I can spit. I mean, I feel Nick would screw all of us. Nick is very lazy. Don't let me take the fire with me, as I drag this through here. He won't pick up anything, he won't lift anything. If you ask him to help you, he'll act like he doesn't hear you. <br/>Nick: I'm sorry. I didn't even hear what you said. <br/>Jeff V.: That's okay. <br/>Nick: I'm zoning out. <br/>Alicia: You know what? He's too secure in his position right now. <br/>Jeff V.: Yeah, absolutely. He's done our kitchen, which is lovely. And he's built a lovely little outdoor chair and he's built a  lovely little patio but only because he doesn't want to do anything else. <br/>Nick: Mentally, you need to feel like you're comfortable  where you are. And that's why I built the kitchen. You know, the kitchen serves little purpose, but it looks good,  it makes you feel comfortable. It's noticeable that you're doing work, which makes people  happy. <br/>Elisabeth: Nice! <br/>Nick: Hey, I made you a recliner, Rodger. <br/>Rodger: Hey, you get that done where I can sleep in it. <br/>Kimmi: I just don't see the necessity in making benches  when we need firewood. I think that that's not a priority, I think that's is a luxury. <br/>Jeff V.: Unfortunately, we need him, so, you know, what  can we do? He's one of our stronger people, but when we get to a point  where somebody in our group has to go, he's going to be the first. [ thunder rumbling]  Mitchell: When it rains, it's a scary moment. If the fire goes out, everything around us gets wet, and we only  have a couple matches. <br/>Jerri: It was at the point where it was almost out, and  there was hardly any light coming off of it. And no heat at all. <br/>Keith: Do you have some of that grass? It was really raining hard. We were not going to let the rain win over our fire. It just wasn't going to happen. <br/>Tina: I'm tired. That was a rough one. Cold, rainy, pretty miserable. <br/>Mitchell: My side of the tent was all wet, so I had to  sleep in wet clothes with a wet blanket and sand, and I can't recall sleeping  even a full hour. <br/>Maralyn: Last night was a hard night. It poured, I mean not just a little drizzle, it just poured. <br/>Keith: People fight, sometimes, to put the fire out. We were up all night trying to keep that fire going. I think the hardest thing for me, so far, has just been trying  to catch up enough sleep so the body's ready to go into combat in our  challenges. <br/>Jerri: Everybody's kind of getting a little lethargic. The fish definitely helped. That was a big morale booster, but ever since, we're kind of on  a downslide right now and it kind of scares me a little bit. <br/>Mitchell: When you think about how low you are on  nutrition and how hungry you are, being tired just... just quadruples it. Getting mail is always an exciting thing, but I was so weak  walking up that hill to get the mail, it was treacherous for me. And I knew, I knew that, inside, there would be a challenge that  I may not be able to do, and that was a depressing thought for me. We got mail. <br/>Colby: Sweet! <br/>Jerri: Percussion! <br/>Mitchell: "I think that you'll find that your tribe's  in a bind, between a hard place and a rock. But if you work as a team, it's not as hard as it seems. Pull together and you'll win as a lock."  Jerri: Ropes-- maybe tug of war? <br/>Colby: Bind in here, which means maybe something's bound  with ropes. <br/>Amber: Maybe we're all going to be tied up or something. <br/>Colby: "Rock and a hard place," it's probably  going to have to do with rocks. <br/>Mitchell: Gosh... I'm a little weak for climbing rocks. <br/>Colby: It's not the time to be weak, brother. <br/>Mitchell: I know. <br/>Colby: I'm dragging. This is the most tired I've been. Personally, I'm a little worried about myself. I know I'm not going to be as strong going into this one as I  have been in the past. <br/>Jeff: Come on down, guys. Welcome to your toughest challenge yet on Survivor. Let me get that immunity idol. Today's challenge is very simple in concept and very tough in  execution. It's an obstacle course. You're going to start by racing through a log chute, then you'll  go down a steep sand slide into the river. On the other side, you'll go through a series of obstacles. Then, finally, you're going to sprint across the sand to the  finish line. It's going to require a lot of physical endurance, flexibility,  and teamwork, because here's the twist: you're going to go tethered as a  team. [ laughter, groaning]  Jeff V.: Oh, God! <br/>Jeff: You're only as fast as your slowest member. <br/>Amber: Wow! <br/>Jeff: If somewhere along the way, a tribe member can't go  any longer, you can carry them. But they have to finish. The first tribe to get all their members across the finish line  wins immunity. Here we go, guys. Survivors ready... Go! <br/>Go, go, go, go, go! <br/>Good, good, good, good! Good, good... Good... good...  Come on, back there. Come on, come on, come on...  Good, good, good. <br/>Look out, look out, look out. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Come on, come on, come on! <br/>Hang on, hang on, hang on. <br/>Come on, come on, come on! <br/>Wait, wait, wait...  Go, go, go! <br/>Go, go! We got it! We got it! <br/>Wait! <br/>Don't pull, don't pull. <br/>You gotta ease up a little. Careful...  Go, go! <br/>Dig deep, dig deep, dig deep! <br/>Go, pick it up, pick it up! <br/>Come on, come on. <br/>Go... go...  Come on! <br/>Come on now! <br/>Go! [ indistinct shouts]  Come on! Come on! [ indistinct shouting]  Go, go, go! Pick up your feet! <br/>Stay on your feet... Stay on your feet, guys. <br/>Jeff: Right here's the finish! <br/>Ouch! <br/>Stand up and walk! <br/>Jeff: Last member across! Last member across! <br/>Watch the table...  Everybody...  Watch the table...  Jeff: Kucha! [ cheering]  Immunity! <br/>Elisabeth: Good job! <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God! Good job, good job! Oh, my God...  Jeff V.: Yeah! [ whooping] [ trilling] [ all gasping, muttering]  Jeff: Kucha, this is yours. You want this, Jeff? <br/>Oh, my God! [ whooping, cheering]  Jeff: Ogakor, you guys know what I'm here to tell you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Tribal council, one of you guys will be going home. <br/>Kimmi: You guys always said, when it comes to teamwork and  heart, Kucha's got it. <br/>Elisabeth: Kucha's got it. <br/>Keith: Our last immunity challenge was a real tough one. Mad Dog Maralyn, you know, she had a difficult time. <br/>Mitchell: Had we voted for Maralyn last week, and not Kel,  I can almost guarantee you we'd have immunity right now. <br/>Colby: She's ready. She'll be very understanding. <br/>Tina: We're going to need Keith. <br/>Tina: The mood in the camp is a sad mood, but it's also a  very strategic move. Everybody's thinking, "Who's thinking what?"  Jerri: There's been five of us: myself, Colby, Mitchell,  Amber and Tina, who've kind of decided to all vote the same. <br/>Keith: My vote's not going towards Maralyn. We've had a lot of physical challenges up till now, but I'm sure  some of them are going to be mental, and I think Maralyn could prove to be an  asset. Why should we lose her? For what, 'cause she fell a few times, 'cause she's older? Why? What kind of team is that? She works her ass off. She's the first one up every morning-- you, me and her. Mitchell does all right, but he struggles. He doesn't do a lot of work. When was the last time you've seen him go up the hill and get  wood? Never. Mitchell's the weakest of our strength of getting a lot of heavy  work done. When it comes to the challenges, Maralyn, I think, is stronger  than he is in the challenges. All we need is just the four of us. No pressure. <br/>Tina: Thanks, Keith. <br/>Keith: I could be cutting my own throat doing this. At least with Colby, we can discuss it, probably disagree upon  it and it'll stay with us. <br/>Colby: Keith's wanting to put you on the chopping block  tonight. And he's got Maralyn with him and he came to me and Tina. Strategies are starting to develop more and go in different  directions, and the more we learn about each other, the more you start to  second-guess what you've done. <br/>Mitchell: Keith is trying to pull around a swing vote to  try to get me out. Why would we want to kick off our fun Maralyn and then keep the  pessimist and the backstabber? <br/>Keith: You guys ready? <br/>Colby: At this point, Keith and Mitchell and Maralyn are  neck-and-neck for tribal council tonight. <br/>Jeff: So let's talk about the council tonight. <br/>Jeff: So let's talk about the fact that you guys have been  here... nine days? <br/>Maralyn: Yes. <br/>Jeff: You're in the honeymoon stage. It hasn't even begun yet. So I just want to talk about a couple of big topics: trust. Colby, is there anybody here that you don't trust, that you  wouldn't trust? <br/>Colby: Sure. Sure. <br/>Jeff: Tell me about that. <br/>Colby: Well, I think that's part of the game. It's way too early to tell exactly who you can trust, I think. <br/>Jeff: What about you, Mitchell? You trust everybody here for 42 days? <br/>Mitchell: Well, I think the motto is "trust no  one." I have a lot of faith in a good number of these people, but I  couldn't give 100% of my trust. <br/>Jeff: What about you, Mad Dog? Are these all your buddies? <br/>Maralyn: Yes. Yes, and Jeff, I trust with my heart. <br/>Jeff: Jerri, who here would you say you're closest to, so  far? <br/>Jerri: Um... I've been very fortunate in my ability to  bond with Amber and Mitchell and Colby, in particular. I think friendship does enter into it at some point, but it's  very important to keep that separate from the game. It's two totally different things, and that's where it gets  tricky. <br/>Jeff: Keith, who have you bonded with? <br/>Keith: Several individuals. You know, and I guess I equate the bonding different than  friendship. I think it's more of a camaraderie for me than it is actual  friendship. <br/>Maralyn: Jeff, I'm conjoined with Tina. <br/>Jeff: Really? <br/>Maralyn: Yes. [ Jerri laughs]  Maralyn: She is a constellation. And... the cowboy. Yeah. Oh, the poor cowboy has dragged me around so many times. <br/>Colby: I'd do it again. <br/>Maralyn: I appreciate it, Cowboy. You hear that, he'd do it again? <br/>Colby: I'd do it again. <br/>Jeff: Colby, are you sad at all tonight? <br/>Colby: Yeah, yeah, I am. Because any way the vote goes on this, the seven of us are  really tight, so the inevitable is here. We're broken up after tonight, and that's tough. No matter which way it goes. <br/>Jeff: It's time to vote. Mad Dog, you're up first. <br/>Keith: Mitchell, it just seems like you're tired. <br/>Jerri: This is probably one of the most difficult things  for me to do right now. It's purely strategic. It's nothing personal. I am going to miss you dearly. <br/>Tina: Mad Dog, I love you, I value your friendship more  than anything. This vote has everything to do with a promise I made. It has nothing to do with you. I hope you'll understand. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are tallied, votes. Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final, and the  person will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. The first vote... Jerri. Maralyn. Mitchell. Mad Dog. Three votes, Mad Dog. And a very sad Mad Dog. You need to bring me your torch, Mad Dog. Mad Dog, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. <br/>Bye. <br/>Jeff: Well, I don't think I have to ask how you guys are  feeling tonight. I think the last vote probably says it all. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Stay tuned for scenes from next time, and Maralyn's final words. Next time on Survivor: Will Keith and Tina wage war against  Jerri? <br/>Keith: I didn't come out here to be pushed around by a  bartender wanna-be actress. [ raspy laughter]  Jeff: And at Kucha, has Michael's blood lust gone too far? <br/>Kimmi: Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God...  Alicia: We've reached a new level. <br/>Michael: If I go out, I'm going out full. [ wry laughter]  Maralyn: I cannot thank you enough for selecting me, and  this experience has meant so much to me. At 52, I could feel myself really coming alive. Oh, hell, I'm tired. Did this all really happen? Did I... did I do this?
