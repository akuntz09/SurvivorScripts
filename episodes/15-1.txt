<br/>Jeff Probst: I'm on the steps of a 16th century Buddhist monastery in one of  the oldest countries in the world, China. 16 Americans are beginning the adventure of a lifetime in ultramodern  Shanghai. But as their journey continues, these 16 strangers are being transported back  in time. Over the next 39 days, the survivors will experience a culture that dates  back nearly 5,000 years. These survivors come from a wide variety of backgrounds. A former Miss Montana. A middle school lunch lady. A Christian radio talk show host. A gay Mormon flight attendant. A professional wrestler. A University of South Carolina honor student. A chicken farmer from Virginia. A professional poker player. There's a fourth grade school teacher, a Nashville musician. A gravedigger from Louisiana. A jewelry designer from Los Angeles. A New York City waitress. A surfing instructor. A bartender and former model. And a 20-year-old student and athlete, the youngest survivor ever. Their adventure will play out in a remote section of China where they will  live in the shadows of this temple on the Lake of a Thousand Islands, a harsh  and remote land that will challenge even the strongest of survivors. It is the ultimate challenge, 16 people, all from different walks of life,  forced to work together to create a new society while battling the elements  and each other. They must learn to adapt or they'll be voted out. In the end, only one will remain to claim the million dollar prize. 39 days, 16 people, one survivor. (theme song playing) Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION   I walked in, and, you know, it was an adventure for me. I was just like a damn kid at a carnival. I ain't never been nowhere. But I loved it. <br/>Being Chinese, it's so amazing coming to do Survivor in China. My grandfather passed away, like, a couple of weeks ago. And he would have just gotten such a kick out of seeing me here, you know. <br/>Probst: Welcome to Survivor: China. I hope you have enjoyed your journey so far. Before the game can begin, you are going to participate in a Buddhist  ceremony inside this 400-year-old temple. I want to assure everybody, because I realize everybody has different  beliefs, this is not a worship ceremony. The people of this land want you to feel welcome. That's the whole point. So, when you're finished, return back out here to me. (chanting)  I work as a lunch lady behind the counter in the cafeteria, and to actually  be in a temple like that, what a great experience. It almost made me cry, to tell you the truth. It was just spiritual. It was very emotional for me. <br/>I'm a waitress from New York City, dude. What do you think? Do you think I know how to do any of this stuff? I'm not trying to be a monk here. I'm tired. I want to sit back with the lemonade. Like, I don't really want to be, like, bowing 37 times. And we bowed... we bowed for, like, days. I swear to God, we were there forever. <br/>I'm a believer in Jesus Christ, and in the Bible it says, "Thou shall  not bow down to any other god." You know, it really felt like worship. I mean, we're in a temple. There's the Buddha. I just couldn't do it. It was emotional for me. Because I knew I did the right thing. But it was so hard. <br/>Probst: Okay, so, Leslie, you didn't make it through the whole ceremony. What happened? <br/>You know, I'm not a religious person, but I have a relationship with Jesus  Christ, and the only time I'm going to put my face on the floor is for him. <br/>Probst: So even though I had said this was a welcome...  I really didn't want to be disrespectful. But it felt like worship. <br/>Probst: Worried that it might impact the next 39 days? <br/>You know, I'm really not. I'm just going to play the game and be me. If they like me, great. If they don't, you know, I'll deal with that. <br/>Probst: A big theme in Buddhism is the leaving behind of your worldly  possessions. That applies to suitcases. It means you will be going into this game wearing the clothes on your back. <br/>Aarrggh! <br/>These are, like, 20 pounds each. <br/>I don't have on a bra. <br/>Probst: Well, that's going to make you either very popular... (laughter) ...or  a big liability if you let it get in the way of challenges or camp life. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right, the game is about to begin. We're going to divide into tribes. There's a bag over here for each of you with your name on it. Come find your bag, put on your buff. <br/>God! <br/>Ashley. <br/>Probst: If you have yellow, head to the left. If you have red, head over here to the right. Put your buff. Yellow tribe-- your name is Zhan Hu, which means "fighting tiger."  We have Frosti, Dave, Jaime, Erik, Peih-gee, Sherea, Ashley, and Chicken. <br/>From the get go, I saw we had a pretty strong team. I'm the youngest and the smallest guy out here, so I got to prove my worth. <br/>Probst: Red tribe, your name is Fei Long. It means "flying dragon." We have Jean-Robert, Leslie, Amanda,  Courtney, Denise, James, Todd, and Aaron. <br/>I am so happy to be a Fei Long member. Because I think James and Aaron are definitely two of our strongest members. So, I think we're going to be a powerhouse in challenges. <br/>Probst: All right, you are about to engage in a battle. For the next 39 days, you will be involved in a struggle for survival. The single greatest document on the history of strategy was written by the  Chinese, The Art of War. Look through this. There is wisdom about strategy in battle that could help you win this game  and the million dollars. (laughter) I also have a map for each tribe to your new home. Fei Long, come get your Art of War and your map. Head out and go to the right. The boat will be waiting for you. Zhan Hu, come get your Art of War and your map. Head out and go to the left of the temple. The boat will be waiting for you. Good luck, guys. (applause)  The person farthest back has the count. <br/>I have a question, does anybody know how to do this? <br/>Let's just all calm down and, like, nice and easy. So we're all going straight rather than spinning in circles. So, we were on this lake in the middle of China. We have no idea where we are. You know, it's like rice paddies and tropical rain forest. And I don't think my tribe for the most part knows what's going on. Right side, everybody. Everybody, right side. No left side. I see myself as a leader, but I try and do it as subtly as possible. I don't want the target on my back. (cheers)  Fei Long! <br/>We've got a great team. <br/>We do have a good team. <br/>We've got, like, an axe thing. We've got rice, you guys! <br/>Is that all that's in there, is rice? <br/>Yeah, just great big bag of rice. <br/>We're going to keep that dry, you guys. <br/>Oh, no. It's raining. <br/>What do you do, Todd? <br/>I'm a flight attendant. <br/>You're a flight attendant? No way. You are so cute. <br/>I'm sorry, I am easily irritated. I seem like to be, like, sort of marooned in a land of flight attendants and  Sunday school teachers. Like, come on. I live in a city. People who live in New York don't act like this. <br/>All right, let's do this. Yeah, Fei Long! <br/>This is like my own private hell. They're, like, exactly the kind of people that I don't like being around, who  are all, like, "Everything's always great. Isn't it amazing? Like you're doing a really good job with that."  High five. <br/>High five! <br/>Yeah, dog. Come on, now. <br/>It's going to be our tree mail, dude. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>There's nothing here. <br/>You said you were a flight attendant? <br/>Yeah. <br/>You really a flight attendant? <br/>Yeah, I really am. <br/>For some reason, I don't... I don't know. <br/>You don't believe me? <br/>It's like I kind of believe you but...  Why would I lie about a job like that? <br/>I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. I like you. I like you, but for some reason, I... you seem a little devious. I'm a professional poker player. And one of the strengths that I have is my ability to read players. I'm just letting you know that I know that you're sharp. I don't know why. My gut feeling tells me you're particularly sharp. My conversation with Todd was deliberate. I wanted him to know that, "Listen, I know that you're the clever guy. Hey, I'm on to you. Don't come this way, and we'll be all right."  Right now, honestly, and I mean this, is I really want to be here. Like, I just really, really, really want to be here, and I will do whatever  to stay, you know. <br/>Jean-Robert was very right. I will do whatever I need to do to win that million dollars. Can I ask you, though, to not tell other people you think I'm sharp? <br/>I mean, I'm not saying that I am, but I don't want to become that one. I can't have someone walking around saying, "Watch out for Todd."  I'm saying, "Watch out for Jean-Robert" now. I'm here to win a million dollars. It's a million dollars. That's a lot of money. <br/>We made it. We got a pot. I'm so hoping we'd have a pot. What are we going to do about shelter, something for the night? <br/>All right, let's start thinking. <br/>When I first walked up, I have on a dress with heels. I'm a southern girl, but I'm not an outdoorsy girl, and this situation is so  disgusting and so nasty. Camp sucks. This is way harder than I expected. <br/>Definitely build some kind of lean-to with it. <br/>Right. <br/>I mean, if we can salvage any of this...  Yeah. <br/>It would be helpful. <br/>Ready? All right, good, good. Watch that big piece of wood. It's rotting. It's... that's okay. <br/>Let's think about this a minute. When you get that up, it ain't going to be big enough for all of us to sleep  under, even you can use that. <br/>Okay, so what do you suggest? <br/>I suggest we build one. <br/>Okay. Well, let's build it. <br/>This is essentially what we, you know--  We could use the foundation of the wood to build it. <br/>Plus we have more back there. <br/>I've got an opinion just like everyone else. Go ahead. I'm from Virginia. I lived in the woods. I've got a lot of experience over these characters. Do you think this here is going to hold up? Seriously, come on. <br/>We have to build something. <br/>We have to build something, though. So let's stop being negative and let's just start being proactive. <br/>I was just giving my opinion, and nobody wanted it, so I'm done suggesting,  you know. I won't do that no more. (loud noise)  Oh, God! <br/>I'm sorry. I've got a little gas. I can't help it. <br/>I don't mind, really. I'm around wrestlers every day of my life. <br/>I seriously can't believe you're a wrestler. <br/>It's so fun. It's the greatest job in the world. It's the funnest job ever. I'm a WW Diva, and I wrestle for a living. I compete. I think that it's probably prepared me a great deal more for this game. I need to chop something up, y'all. Because there is that competitive nature you have within the locker room, and  that's a great positive that I'm going to have going into this game. We are going to have a really awesome shelter. I don't want to go home a loser, you know what I mean? Because I know my fans are going to want me to win. Oh, hell, no, I can't dance at all. I'm the worst. My girlfriends in the locker room, like, they always play music while we're  getting ready. I'm not doing it! I can't. <br/>I think I'm on the lazy tribe. Just seeing, like, half the people wanting to just stand around and talk  about the most ridiculous stuff I'd ever heard. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>What song? <br/>It don't matter. <br/>I can't connect to the wackiness out here. Like, I mean, I could probably do it at home, but I just... I feel like so  serious. <br/>Why can't we do the shelter right here? Because it's much more open and cleaner than up there under the trees. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Honestly, we just need to make a decision. <br/>Why am I here?! <br/>Oh, God, please help us. (laughter)  I need some vines. <br/>Is that helping, you guys? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Let's get more, though. <br/>Yeah, oh, yeah. <br/>Timber. <br/>I just need a few more for the bed. <br/>You guys are, like, regular lumbermen. <br/>Timber! <br/>We're getting a lot accomplished with our shelter. We are a very strong tribe. We get along great, and we work well together. <br/>How you doing, James? <br/>Hey, man. <br/>I think James is amazing. He's, like, Superman. I've never seen... he just works. But I'm worried about James because he's just been very quiet. I mean, you're an interesting guy. What do you do? <br/>You bury people. That's interesting. Are you serious? <br/>Yeah. Yeah, I'm a grave digger. I like that work because, you know, I'm kind of by myself. That's part of my problem over here now. I'm used to being by myself. <br/>You know what, charm is deceptive. You be you and you'll be fine. The whole initiation of the social thing, talking and trying to strategize,  that's going to kill me. <br/>Okay, ask people questions, because they love to talk about themselves. <br/>I'm definitely worried about the social aspect. I need to pay more attention to that, so I need to do a little bit more  hustling. Hopefully, pull out the challenges and make them love me. <br/>The heavens unzipped on us. <br/>Where we put the shelter is very important, and this was, obviously, a  temporary thing. <br/>Yeah, this, obviously...  It was a terrible idea. <br/>What do y'all want to do? <br/>Build a shelter. <br/>Yeah, what do you want? Here, here, up there? Last night was really wet. It's a reality check for these guys up here. We'll try to straighten this mess up a little bit. Maybe everybody will come together today, you know. <br/>There you go. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Does someone want to find stuff with me? <br/>What are you going to do? <br/>I'm going to find, like, some leaves. <br/>I think we need fronds and vines. <br/>I'm not feeling so good. My first night was pretty rough. I was soaking wet for the whole night. I think I'm pretty sick. I have chills, like, really bad. And, like, I keep dry heaving. Like I want to throw up but there's just nothing in there. <br/>What about Ashley? She does not look good at all. <br/>I feel so worried for her. <br/>I've wrestled sick before. I've wrestled with 104 fever before. I have to stay in the game. I'm not leaving. Hopefully, it will pass. <br/>I know, if you're feeling bad don't start thinking you're on the block just  because of this. Okay? Ashley, I thought she'd be a lot stronger person, considering her profession  and how her demeanor is. But if Ashley's health stays the same, Ashley's going first. <br/>We've got some tree mail. Waa! Dude, check this out. <br/>You guys, we got some tree mail. <br/>Fei Long! <br/>You guys, check out how cool, eh. <br/>"The untested enemy you must face today. They may have the power to send one of you away. With your namesake held above you, and with honor in your heart, will you  lead your tribe to victory or be the first one to depart?" This is  immunity, obviously. <br/>Obviously. Game is on, huh? <br/>That book, Art of War, we should take a look at that probably before our  challenge. <br/>Yeah. <br/>All right. Chapter one, "The commander stands for the general's qualities of  wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness."  In a way, it's saying we need a commander, and I can't help but notice that  you've kind of taken that position. We do need someone who's strong and knows how to take lead, and you're very  good at it. <br/>It feels weird, but, I think I can do it. <br/>Okay. Aaron's a very strong player. And I'm very, very smart in trying to push the leader role more so on to  Aaron, because I don't want to take that position, but also to keep him close  to me. I want him to trust me. <br/>It will be like, a... it will be like a democracy. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Being in the leadership role, it's not someplace that I want to be. But leadership is just going for it. I'm ready, but I'm nervous. <br/>"With your namesake held above you, and with honor in your heart, will  you lead your tribe to victory or be the first one to depart?"  Ashley, you hanging in there? <br/>Yes, I'm going to pull through. <br/>If it's like obstacles, I should be, probably... I'm thinking I'm probably  one of the better guys. I'm small, too, so it's easy for me. But climbing stuff isn't hard. I'm a parkour and free-running performer. It is under control. Parkour basically comes down to what's the best, fastest, most efficient,  safest way to get over anything. So if there's a wall, you're going to run up it, jump over it. If it there's rails, you're going to bolt them. Whatever it takes. There we go, we've got it. I'm going to use my skills to do whatever I can to get my team across the  finish line first and win. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. So, tell me about the first three days. Chicken, how has life been at Zhan Hu? <br/>About as well as expected. (laughs) Overall, we're doing okay. We're okay. <br/>Probst: Jean-Robert, what's the worst part? <br/>The worst part, honestly, Jeff, is just being fully drenched and trying to  sleep. I haven't gotten a wink yet. <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready to get to your first challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, each tribe will be tethered to and carrying a  ceremonial mascot that is both awkward and heavy. On my go, you must maneuver through a series of obstacles. When you get to the locked gate, one tribe member will race ahead and scale  two walls, releasing a drawbridge at each wall. You'll then retrieve a key, race back, unlock the gate, bring the rest of the  tribe. You must then make your way through a swamp to the finish platform, where you  will need to solve the puzzle. Each tribe member must place their pole in the correct spot. The first tribe to do so wins the challenge. You want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes, please! <br/>Probst: The single most important thing in this game is immunity. This is the immunity idol. (cheers and applause) When you have this in your possession, you cannot be  voted out of this game. Winning tribe gets immunity, and winning tribe gets fire. (applause) Fire in the form of flint. This will dramatically change camp life. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: One more thing, you were given your running shoes for this challenge. You can take them back to camp with you. (applause) Take your spots. We'll get started. Here we go. It is the first challenge of Survivor: China. At the head of the dragon and retrieving the key for Fei Long is James. At the head of the tiger for Zhan Hu, Frosti. For immunity and fire, survivors ready? Go! Denise falls for Fei Long. Zhan Hu trying to figure it out. We're dead even early on. The tribe that works together the best will win this challenge. Still dead even going up the first platforms. Fei Long in the lead with the red dragon. <br/>Up top. <br/>Probst: Zhan Hu slow going with the yellow tiger. Fei Long with a bit of a lead. James got to unclip. James having trouble getting unclipped. Zhan Hu is catching up. <br/>Go, go! <br/>Probst: Frosti is now unclipped. So is James. Both guys leap the first wall. Frosti forgot to lower his drawbridge. He lost some time. James now with a bit of a lead for Fei Long. Frosti right behind. Got to unlock the gate and then clip back in. James has his lock open. Frosti got it open. Both are clipping in. You've got to get clipped in. We are neck and neck again. Neck and neck going into the swamp. Got to stick together. Zhan Hu struggling with the yellow tiger. Fei Long taking that red dragon in the lead. Fei Long first to the finish platform. Zhan Hu falling behind. Zhan Hu now to the finish platform. <br/>Over here! <br/>Probst: You've got to put your poles in the correct order. They go in one way and only one way. Fei Long with some progress. Zhan Hu getting nowhere with the puzzle. Fei Long thinks they have it. Fei Long wins immunity and fire! <br/>Woo-hoo! <br/>Yeah! Way to go, baby. <br/>Probst: Fei Long, immunity. <br/>Yeah! (applause)  Probst: Nobody going home tonight. Denise wants the flint. There's your fire. Zhan Hu, you've got a date with me, tribal council tonight, where one of the  eight of you will earn the distinction of being the first person voted out of  Survivor: China. You have the afternoon to figure it out. See you at tribal. <br/>I need to air out my shoes. <br/>Full of mud. <br/>I need to go have a seat down there. <br/>Have a seat, take a break. You need five minutes? Do what you got to do. <br/>I need, like, more than that. <br/>Take... hey, hey. Let it all out. Don't care if you cry. Bawl your little head off, okay. Don't sweat it. As I see it right now, we are all still a complete tribe. I'd like to see us function as such, pretty please. We have unfortunate business to do tonight. It sucks. It is a fact of life. <br/>We need to all, like, really pitch in at camp because I just feel like, I  know everybody is doing stuff, and I just feel like there's so much to do. And it just sucks... like, it sucks to know that, you know. <br/>We are not going to win any challenges if we don't have, like, a decent  shelter. <br/>It is hard out here. More so than I ever imagined. And I'm trying to get through it without being down about it. We have to do two crossbeams under like this. We need two more of these things. What do you think is the best way? Do you think do it the same way is the best way? <br/>You need to get everybody's opinion. <br/>I'm asking your opinion. <br/>I agree with you. <br/>I wasn't stating my opinion. I was asking yours. <br/>I agree with you. That'll work. <br/>But I just, I say the two options. So which one do you think is better in your opinion? <br/>I would put two more pieces down like you said. <br/>I know you want to put two more pieces, but how? Chicken won't give an opinion on how he thinks anything should be done. It's not worth anything to me if he chooses not to apply his strength. We're going to try to keep the instruments, if they're not in use just in one  area so everybody knows where they are, and, like, they don't get lost. <br/>Peih-gee, all of a sudden, she's sort of barking out orders and trying to  step into this leadership position. <br/>Take these two jugs and pour them out into that big thing. <br/>All righty. <br/>If you're going to do that, then you shouldn't be crying after challenges. You know, that's not a leader role. I know we have to work and everything, but we still have to think what we're  going to do at tribal council. <br/>I would hope to think I'm not going to be voted out by anybody because I'm  not sick at all. I feel a million times better than I did before. I see what can do. I would hate to think one day of being sick would dominate over everything. <br/>She was sick yesterday. So.... <br/>That's not the point. <br/>That's true. <br/>I didn't ask if she was sick. I just asked you what she done yesterday. Whether (inaudible), whether you fell down the bank and sprained you ankle,  or you got a damn headache, or whatever, it's an ailment that can take you  out of the game. It's just that, you know... it's just that simple. I feel like Ashley's gone. That's what I'm writing down tonight. She ain't done nothing since she's landed down here. What are you doing? You don't know? <br/>I need to figure stuff out. <br/>Whatever happens, happens. You know, I don't even know if I'm 100% safe tonight, you know, for whatever  reason. That's what makes the element of the game. <br/>I think the heads on the block tonight are Chicken, Ashley, and Peih-gee. Chicken, I, you know, we're the two oldest guys. And I've got nothing against youth, but, you know in this kind of environment  situation, I would prefer to have a little more experience in our tribe right  now. I don't wish anybody bad here. But I want our tribe to be strong. And it's time to make stuff happen. <br/>Probst: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch. Approach the flame. This is part of the ritual of tribal council because in this game fire  represents your life. As long as you have fire, still in the game; when your fire's gone, so are  you. Let's talk about the first few days. Peih-gee, was this more than you bargained for? <br/>You know, I came in here thinking this was a piece of cake, but it is mud  everywhere. Trying to build a shelter is hard because you don't have the right implements. <br/>Probst: Chicken, you held up two fingers. <br/>It took us two days to do that. We should have had it by dark the first day. <br/>Probst: Did you try to become the leader and say, "Hey, let's go,  guys."  I'm not grabbing the bull by the horns and done that, no, I haven't. But I guess somebody's going to have to before we come together. That's what's going to have to be done. <br/>Probst: Show of hands-- anybody here willing to say right now, "I will  step up and be the leader of this tribe?" Well, you've got two, one man,  one woman. <br/>We don't have time to mess around. I did not want to step in to this position at all. And you know what? If I don't step up and kick someone in the butt to do something, I don't know  what's going to happen, but I will step up and do what I can to help get this  tribe together and proficient and then focus on the challenges at hand, and  hopefully get it really nice and tight. <br/>Probst: Peih-gee, you put your hand up. What would you bring as a leader? <br/>It is hard because you don't want to be bossy. These are grown people and I don't want to be sitting around trying to tell  people what to do, but on the other hand, somebody has to kind of do it if  it's not happening naturally. If you're just floundering around, you're going to die out here. <br/>Probst: So, did you guys just make a decision, your first tribe decision? <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: But after tonight's tribal council, there will only be seven people  left, so you're probably wise to always be a little concerned. Okay, so made a little progress as a tribe. Now you have to make your first big decision. Who do you get rid of? Dave, what does this tribe need to do with tonight's vote to make it a better  tribe? <br/>Trying to trim the least-productive people out of it. <br/>Probst: Chicken, what are you going to base your vote on tonight? <br/>I'll base my vote on tonight the person who has done the least in the last  three days. It's just cut and dried. <br/>Probst: Erik, how important is it whether somebody is pulling their weight or  not pulling their weight? <br/>I think contributions is huge. I mean, especially now that we've realized how long it takes to build a  shelter. And so I think we're going to really have to hold each other accountable. <br/>Probst: Ashley, think you're fitting in with this group? <br/>I did for a while. And I mean, now that I'm hearing everybody speak freely, I kind of feel like  that if you broke it down per day, I was throwing up, I was laying on the  ground. I pretty much was feeling like I was going to die. And I guess if you put that in the equation, then I would have technically  been the one who has done the least amount of work. I don't feel like I should be judged on that. <br/>Probst: So you're feeling a little uneasy. <br/>Right now I am because I hear how they're talking. <br/>Probst: Chicken, how do you think you're fitting? <br/>I don't fit in. You know, I don't. But, I'm not the one that's done the least amount of work, and you're out  there in the middle of a jungle. You ain't got nothing. So do you want the guy that don't fit in or do you want the guy that works? You know, if we don't open our eyes, we going to be seeing you a lot. <br/>Probst: Okay, so, it sounds like you have a plan to have leadership in your  tribe. Now you have to make the first big decision-- who to get rid of. It is time to vote. Frosti, you're up. <br/>I'm voting for Peih-gee because I feel like the group already has a leader,  and that's Dave. <br/>Just bad luck. Wrong time, wrong place. <br/>Chicken, I think you've truly lived up to your nickname. You've been too afraid to step up to anything, and we don't need that right  now. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Probst: Once the votes are read, the decision is final.

First person voted out of Survivor: China-- Chicken. <br/>Damn! <br/>Probst: That's four. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Chicken, the tribe has spoken. <br/>I heard 'em. <br/>Probst: Time for you to go. Well, if there's one good thing about coming to tribal council tonight, you  will go back to camp with your torches, which means you will have fire. <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>Probst: Here's flint. <br/>Yes! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor: At Fei Long, the poker player's bluff is  called. <br/>Jean-Robert, you need to start pulling your weight. <br/>Why don't we all rest? <br/>Probst: Dave takes command at Zhan Hu. <br/>You're the leader and I'll let you do what you want. <br/>How many fires have you built, sweetheart?

They're just playing by the seat of their pants. I put a lot of thought going into it but I never got nowhere. There's no one more proud to be such a small part of one big adventure. It was truly an honor to be here. Without a doubt.
