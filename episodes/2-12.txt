<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor: with Jerri gone, Amber was  on her own. <br/>Keith: She's kind of a lone lamb. I think Amber made a tactical mistake by staying tight with  Jerri. <br/>Jeff: The food situation was desperate. <br/>Amber: This is how much rice we have left to last us 14  days. <br/>Jeff: And the tribe was running on empty. <br/>Elisabeth: I feel so weak. I'm feeling terrible. <br/>Jeff: The rising waters were a growing threat to the  Barramundi camp. <br/>Elisabeth: A storm could come and just wash our tent right  out. It's right in line with the riverbed. <br/>Jeff: At the immunity challenge, Colby's dwindling  strength didn't stop him from winning the talisman. [ Colby yelling]  Jeff: Back at camp, the tribe was offered more food. You've got 13 days left, and I don't think you're going to make  it. But it came with a hefty price. I need something of value. I'm talking camp: your tarps and that Texas flag. <br/>Tina: I think it was a fair trade. There's worse things in life than being wet, such as starving to  death. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Jerri and Alicia returned as  members of the jury, and Nick was voted out. Six remain. Who will be the next to go? <br/>Elisabeth: This game, in the past three days, has become  drastically primal. We are just beings out here that need food. <br/>Amber: The servings are so small. It's, like, maybe four spoonfuls. <br/>Elisabeth: It's turned into a nightmare, all of a sudden. You just can't think about it. The things that are important have become really clear here. You know, you shed yourself of all excess, and we just gave up  our shelter for food. And that is a pretty, pretty extreme situation. <br/>Amber: When we got our new rice, we decided we needed to  be very, very careful with it this time. The risk of losing it again just wasn't going to be an option. So we measured out the rice cup by cup by cup by cup. This is the least amount of rice we've ever had. <br/>Tina: No wonder we're all so weak and tired. This is all we're living on. <br/>Elisabeth: Anyone want some scrapings from the pot? <br/>Colby: Oh, sure. <br/>Tina: That rice gave me hope that I was not going to have  to be out here starving to death for the next 11 days, which, to be honest,  that's what I thought was going to occur. <br/>Amber: Hope factors in a huge amount for your existence  here. I mean, you always have to hope for the next day to come, hope  for a fish, a nice night with no rain. And I just keep hoping that the next three days to come, I'm  still here and the next three days to come that I'm still here. <br/>Elisabeth: Keith, Colby and Tina are three together. And they see Amber, although she's grown a lot, they don't see  that she is a strong person. <br/>Tina: Amber's a sweet girl, but you can't get by just on  flying below the radar. She never really proved to me that she could stand on her own  two feet. Now, she has proved to me that she's a tougher little girl than  I made her out to be. <br/>Elisabeth: The people who are in control are basically  going to push your eject button one time or another. And you just hope it's not the next time. <br/>Colby: Rodger and Elisabeth both know that we brought them  along this entire time with the intent to eliminate them before we eliminate  ourselves. And they are well aware of the fact that they've got to win  immunity in order to stick around. <br/>Elisabeth: The next challenges are very important to me. Reward and immunity. I don't care how hungry and weak I am, there's no holding me  back. I need them. <br/>Jeff: How are you feeling? I need them. <br/>Jeff: How are you feeling? <br/>Rodger: Good. <br/>Tina: All right. <br/>Jeff: Okay, today's challenge is for a reward. It's a ropes course, and it's designed to be confusing. It's a jungle rope maze. You'll have four checkpoints along the way. At each checkpoint, there are several ropes that lead either directly  or indirectly to the next one. We'll have two carabiners. One carabiner needs to be attached to your rope at all times. So, whenever you change ropes, you take the other carabiner  that's free, clip to the new rope, then unclip from the existing rope. First person to reach all four checkpoints, get to the finish,  wins the reward. The reward is a food reward with a twist. Yo, come on in! As you know, in the Outback... Yeah, lots of cattle, lots of  cattle ranches. Stockmen-- Australian cowboys-- are the guys who take care of  the cattle. <br/>Amber: Oh, my God! <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, look at how beautiful. <br/>Jeff: You're going to saddle up on a horse with these  guys, spend the night. You'll have a trek through the Outback on horseback, you'll go  back to their camp, have some authentic stockman grub. What are you having? What's for dinner tonight? <br/>Beef cubes, beans and bread and butter...  Jeff: All the Bud Light you can drink to go with that? Sounds good. What about breakfast? <br/>You can have some bacon and eggs for breakfast. <br/>Amber: Oh, God. <br/>Jeff: You'll also have a cot to sleep on. <br/>Amber: Wow. That's a good reward. <br/>Jeff: Let's head to the game. We'll see you guys at the end. Thanks. <br/>Amber: Bye. <br/>Elisabeth: Bye. <br/>Jeff: Let's go. <br/>Jeff: Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Jeff: Almost there! Go! <br/>Jeff: Almost there! Keep going, Amber. He's wearing down. Nice job. [ Amber groaning] Way to go, Rodger. You're coming in for the bronze. That-a-way, Rodg. <br/>Amber: Way to go, Tina. <br/>Jeff: Way to finish, Elisabeth. You got it, girl. <br/>Tina: Go, girl! All the way! <br/>Jeff: That-a-way, Chef. Finish strong. Colby, come here. I want to give you a little taste of some of the food you're  going to have tonight. They call this damper. No, it's for him. <br/>Colby: Can I give it to them? <br/>Jeff: No. I'm sorry, you can't. <br/>Tina: Thanks, Colby. That's okay, Colby. <br/>Jeff: This is just a little sample here. Take a little bite of this. They make this up all the time. Good stuff? You can take this on your horseback ride. The boys are waiting for you just up ahead. <br/>Tina: Enjoy it. <br/>Rodger: Have fun. <br/>Jeff: Have a good time, man. See you tomorrow. <br/>Colby: Thanks, guys. <br/>Elisabeth: You tell us all about it. <br/>Rodger: Put some pork and beans in your pocket to bring  back. <br/>Tina: Get strong. We'll miss you tonight. <br/>Colby: I'm ready. We'll miss you tonight. <br/>Colby: I'm ready. [ thunder rumbling] [ thunder booms] [ thunder rumbling] [  thunder booms]  Colby: The storm hit about ten minutes into the ride. We went right into the face of the storm, and that kind of  startled the horses a little bit. [ horse whinnies] Heavy, heavy, heavy winds. You couldn't see anything around you. It felt like hail, the raindrops were coming down so hard. There was so much water running, it really looked like there was  water running uphill. It was bad stuff. Worse than any storm I've ever been through. I feel sorry for all those guys that had to go back to a very  wet Barramundi Beach. <br/>Rodger: Wow, how fast did that come? <br/>Keith: Unbelievable. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my gosh. <br/>Amber: This is unbelievable. <br/>Elisabeth: This is... all this weather happened in an  hour. We came across here, and there was one puddle. <br/>Keith: Let's hope our riverbed didn't get flooded like  this. Our camp is gone. <br/>Rodger: After seeing this, where we've got our camp is  called a dry creek bed. I doubt it if it's dry right now. <br/>Tina: The thing is, I don't know how we're going to get  across. <br/>Rodger: It's going to be a good while before we get across  here. We're talking some hours here. We had to wait two or three hours till the creeks had gone down. [ thunder rumbling] Everybody had kind of quit talking, but I  knew what was on everybody's mind. Everybody was thinking what's going to be left back there when  we get back there. <br/>Rodger: We're okay, girls, we get back there. <br/>Rodger: We're okay, girls, I think. <br/>Keith: Don't jump to conclusions. <br/>Rodger: Oh, gosh. conclusions. <br/>Rodger: Oh, gosh. <br/>Amber: We have barely anything. <br/>Rodger: Oh, gosh. When I first come down the bank there, I could see some blankets  hanging on the line, I thought, oh, everything's okay. Then I walked another 20 feet, where I could see on over, and I  could see that everything wasn't okay. It looked like a small hurricane or something went through  there. <br/>Amber: Wow...  Rodger: It's here, but barely. I hope the rice is here. <br/>Amber: Oh, my God! <br/>Rodger: Where was the rice can? <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God. <br/>Amber: I don't know where the rice can was at! <br/>Rodger: Don't worry about it. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my gosh...  Rodger: The rice tin was right over here. <br/>Amber: The rice tin probably washed away. <br/>Elisabeth: It looks like the rice is gone, you guys. <br/>Rodger: No supper. <br/>Elisabeth: Whoa. We were really wondering if we'd get back here and find our dry  riverbed not so dry, and... despite all optimism and hope, our entire  campsite was washed out. <br/>Amber: Looks like a tornado went through here. <br/>Rodger: The rice is gone, our knives are gone...  Tina: Absolutely incredible. <br/>Rodger: Where's our fishing tackle? <br/>Elisabeth: Gone. Everything that was on that box, that table. <br/>Rodger: Yeah, we had the hooks right up in there. <br/>Keith: That water came through like a flurry and just took  everything with it. It was just... there was no way to describe it. Especially when we're out here with so little, and we lost  everything. <br/>Tina: I walked down the hill and I saw the devastation. And my first thought was, you know, that's our home. <br/>Rodger: Let's just see if some of that stuff may have been  stuck in here. <br/>Tina: Washed away our food, our cooking, our knives,  everything. Everything's just gone. And to be honest, I was just really, really mad. I don't know who I was mad at or what I was mad at. I was just angry. <br/>Elisabeth: We have no food. <br/>Amber: No, none. <br/>Elisabeth: We have no food. We can't even fish. We don't have any fishing rods. We haven't eaten all day. [ thunder rumbilng]  Colby: That challenge-and- [ thunder rumbilng]  Colby: That challenge-andreward combination was tailor-  made for me. Hey, Jeff! <br/>Jeff: You look like you would were born to ride. <br/>Colby: We've been having a great time. To be able to jump on horseback and go ride out to a camp with a  bunch of cowboys and sit around a campfire and eat beans and beef stew. I mean, that's something I would do at home. Thank you very much. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>Colby: Oh, man, this is so good. <br/>Jeff: So how do you assess your shot now: Nine days  tomorrow, when you go back. You're obviously going to have a leg up, because right now, this  food's going to give you a lot of energy. <br/>Colby: Well, physically, maybe, you have a leg up. Politically, you're a leg down, especially because this is my  second reward in a row. You know, inevitably there's got to be some resentment there. And a lot of that goes through your head. You think of the politics, you think, well, do I pull up five  feet and let Amber win this...  Jeff: Really! <br/>Colby: And then you... you just say no. You are here to win, you're here to compete. And it may happen. I may get voted off in the next couple of tribal councils and if  does, I'm going to be glad I ate this tonight. I feel just about as fortunate as I have in 33 days to be able  to not only get a warm hot meal but also get a warm dry bed to sleep in. <br/>Jeff: Colby, final cheer. I'm going to down this. I'm gonna leave you. <br/>Colby: Thanks, Jeff. It's a very bittersweet time, when you realize what you're  doing. Virtually, what I'm doing by enjoying coffee and enjoying a cot  is taking that opportunity away from somebody else. <br/>This song's called "Drinking Beer With Your  Mates." âª So set the drinks up, barman 'Cause I've only got one day âª  And keep 'em comin' Talk fast, and wind will blow our bay âª At night,  around our campfire, It's great to listen there The stories get a whole  better When you've got a heap of beer... âª  Colby: Yeah! <br/>Amber: When I got back to the camp, we didn't really have  much to say to each other because we were all just devastated. <br/>Keith: I'm going to go further down because that food  should float, you know? <br/>Elisabeth: The stuff could be caught, dragged under here. Well, Tina and Keith thought of going downriver and seeing if  they can find something that washed up on shore. <br/>Keith: So I just walked the riverbank and realized that on  the other side, our tin of food was there. It was still sealed. <br/>Tina: We can cross down here, where the current's not so  strong and go across the bank. <br/>Keith: That's a little deep there. <br/>Tina: It may be deep. You're going to try to cross this current? You're crazy. Trust me, you can't cross that. You'll slip. <br/>Keith: I'd rather try that. <br/>Rodger: Well, be careful out in that current. I wasn't so much worried about him getting knocked down off the  log on into the river. I was worried about him falling backwards. You want a rope or something to put around you? I was afraid he'd get swept down underneath that log and get  caught on some limbs down underneath there, and there'd have been no way in  the world anybody would have been able to get him out of there. <br/>Tina: Keith, how do you think you're going to get it back  across? <br/>Rodger: You'll never make it. <br/>Tina: I went on downriver. I think Keith was trying to cross the wrong way. I saw that the current was strong... your adrenaline gets  pumping, and you just know: I can do anything. <br/>Amber: Keith... oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. <br/>Amber: Tina's across, Keith! Keith come back! Oh, they're making me so nervous. <br/>Elisabeth: I just don't want to take my eyes off them. <br/>Rodger: If you can't bring it all, just bring one plastic  bag of it over or something. Leave the can over there. Throw it behind you, and the rapids will bring it right down to  you. Ready? Watch this turn-- that current. <br/>Keith: Ready? <br/>Tina: Yeah. <br/>Rodger: Y'all surprised me. <br/>Tina: Yeah. <br/>Rodger: Y'all surprised me. I wouldn't have thought the chance of finding that was one in  10,000. <br/>Amber: I don't know how you guys saw that. <br/>Keith: Our food. <br/>Rodger: I can't believe the lid stayed on that thing. <br/>Elisabeth: You guys are... you are amazing. <br/>Rodger: Hey, good job, buddy. <br/>You make me want to cry. <br/>Rodger: Tina, good job. <br/>Tina: Thank you. <br/>Rodger: One heck of a job. <br/>Tina: Thank you. <br/>Amber: Thank you so much. We're going to start a fire, Tina, we're going to get you warmed  up. <br/>Tina: We were very hungry. It's the thing that we feel most out here. And there was nothing that would keep me from getting that rice  can. It's just survival of the fittest, and I want to eat, plain and  simple. I want the rice. <br/>Keith: Food's everything to us at this stage. Geez, we gave up our shelter for our food. Then we lose it in the rain? That's not going to happen. <br/>Rodger: Hey, Keith, do we have our matches? <br/>Keith: No. They got wet. They were there in my coat. And the coat got wet. They're wet. <br/>Rodger: We got the rice and no fire. <br/>Amber: We were cold and we were wet. And we were thinking at least we can light a fire and dry off. And we had no way of starting the fire. It was just devastating. I mean, it's like nothing else could have gone wrong. <br/>Rodger: I'd suggest to anybody who don't have on dry  clothes needs to be doing it before dark falls here, 'cause we're all going  to be freezing tonight. <br/>You can look forward to a good warm night's sleep, eh,  Colb? <br/>Colby: Oh, man. The cot, yeah. Breakfast in the morning. <br/>Bacon and eggs. <br/>Colby: Golly. [ laughing] I'm going to have to pace myself a little better  than I did tonight. I dug in too fast tonight. I was hungry and I dove in. And the first plate I had just went straight through me. I felt awful. We were so used to eating nothing but rice out here. My stomach just, it twisted and turned. As soon as that second or third spoonful went in, I knew it was  going to be trouble. <br/>You couldn't help it? <br/>Colby: It went through me, man. I just, I couldn't help it. It's been too long since I've had any good food. <br/>Elisabeth: This is Survivor, you guys. This is the stuff that you just didn't plan for. <br/>Rodger: You can't begin to tell anybody back home what  you've been through. <br/>Amber: You can't even describe this. <br/>Rodger: No. <br/>Amber: It's something you can't even describe. <br/>Rodger: Survivoris definitely real. <br/>Amber: This is no longer a game. This is...  Rodger: This is, this is...  Amber: No, this is life right now. <br/>Colby: Unequivocally the best peanut butter and jelly I've  ever had in my life. I'm stuffed already. We hadn't even broken into the bacon and eggs, and I don't give  a damn. I'm going to eat as much as I can here and then I'm going to go  sit by the fire and eat as much as I can over there. I may have to stop and use the bathroom four times on the way  back to camp, and it doesn't matter. Mm... [ sizzling]  Hey, Colby, how do you want your eggs, mate? Didn't you say you wanted them fairly runny? <br/>Colby: Yeah. I appreciated the opportunity to eat incredibly. Just the opportunity, no matter how sick it made me and no  matter how sick I feel now. I had that choice. I had the choice to eat, and eat and eat. I'm very fortunate. Boy, that's good, Pedro. Bacon, eggs, perfect. The beans are good. Mm...  Keith: That was the most Mm...  Keith: That was the most miserable night in my entire  life. I can now say that. I will never have a more miserable night. I hope not. <br/>Elisabeth: We just have to make sure that tonight's a  little more safe from the weather than last night. Building a shelter. This is our first priority right now. <br/>Tina: Hey, Rodger, the sand's actually dry in there, in  our thing. <br/>Amber: Are we thinking of staying down there? <br/>Keith: Right there at the top of the ridge. Nothing to build a little shelter. <br/>Rodger: I had laid awake all night thinking about the  shelter. And I definitely did not want to put it back down there on that  sand. <br/>Tina: There's no good place to hide here. It's very frustrating. Where the heck do we build it, you know? In the river bed where it's going to flood or up on the high  point where we can get struck by lightning? <br/>Rodger: If we can get the roof on it the first thing, get  it like we want it, we can at least get underneath that tonight. at least get underneath that tonight. <br/>Colby: I think this is the worst-case scenario that could  possibly happen, returning to camp and having to see what all your tribe  mates went through the night before. We tell each other over and over, "When you win a reward,  don't feel guilty." But, inevitably, you feel guilty. And it wiped everything out, you know, including a good portion  of everybody's emotional steam. Oh, my gosh. I can't believe this. I'm so sorry y'all had to go through this. It'll be all right. How are you, Tina? <br/>Tina: Did you have a good time? I know you were thinking about us. <br/>Colby: I was. <br/>Tina: I know you were. <br/>Colby: Oh, man. Guys, I just... I can't believe what happened. When I walked up this morning...  Rodger: Sickening, wasn't it? <br/>Colby: ...it's sickening, you're right. Everyone's going through the ringer right now. And out of all six of us, I've been the luckiest. This immunity challenge is such a double-edged sword for me. I'm worried about saving my own butt, but a bigger part of me is  worried about winning another challenge and how that's going to affect the  way I'm viewed. challenge and how that's going to affect the way I'm viewed. <br/>Jeff: You look worn out. <br/>Rodger: We are. <br/>Jeff: Quite a day yesterday. <br/>Amber: We'll be okay. We've made it up until now. We only have nine days left. We're going to make it. <br/>Jeff: Well, tonight we have a tribal council. I'll take back the immunity talisman. This is becoming very important at this stage of the game. Now, let's get to today's immunity challenge. You'll each have three plates and a slingshot as a weapon. For ammo, Australian macadamia nuts. Your goal: break the other tribe member's plates before they  break yours. When all your plates are broken, you're out of the game. The last person left standing with a plate intact wins immunity  and you make the final five. Take your spot at a weapon. Wait for my start. Remember, you each have three plates. The last person with a plate intact wins. Survivors, ready... aim... fire. <br/>Colby: Ooh...! Hey. <br/>Keith: Sorry, bro. <br/>Colby: What's up with that? <br/>Keith: It's the pretty blue. I love that color. <br/>Colby: You want to play like that, huh? <br/>Jeff: Aim... fire. <br/>Colby: Oh...  Jeff: First one down. <br/>Colby: The chef is cooked. <br/>Keith: Ouch. <br/>Colby: Ooh, that hurt. <br/>Jeff: Aim... fire. <br/>Jeff: Elisabeth and Amber. <br/>Rodger: Sorry, Amber. This is one straight away. <br/>Jeff: Amber, Elisabeth, Keith all have one plate out. Aim... fire. <br/>Amber: Hey, buddy! <br/>Jeff: Elisabeth, a gunslinger. Amber, down to one plate. Ready... aim... fire. Tina. <br/>Colby: Sorry. It was the closest one to me. <br/>Jeff: Aim... fire. <br/>Keith: Sorry, bro. <br/>Colby: It's all right. <br/>Jeff: Keith got even. Rodger has no plates out. <br/>Rodger: Shh. Shh, don't... You don't have to tell them all that. <br/>Jeff: Aim... fire. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: Boy, that meal did you some good. <br/>Colby: Hey, I don't know what it was. <br/>Jeff: Eyesight is sharp. Everybody has a plate out. Amber has two. Aim... fire. Aim... fire. Amber, you're out of the game. Who took out Amber? <br/>Colby: I did. It's nothing personal. <br/>Amber: I'm paying attention. <br/>Jeff: Ready... aim... fire. <br/>Tina: Whoo! <br/>Jeff: Keith down to one plate. Rodger, you're down to one plate. Ready... aim... fire. <br/>Colby: Ooh. <br/>Oh! <br/>Colby: Tina, wow. <br/>Rodger: Sorry, sister. <br/>Keith: You get Colby over there and I'll get Colby over  here. <br/>Keith: That's fine. <br/>Colby: Now, come on, guys. <br/>Jeff: Ready... aim... fire. Colby down to one plate. Aim... fire. Oh, Keith's out of the game. Take a seat next to Amber. Ready... aim... fire. Tina, out of the game. <br/>Colby: See ya, Tina. <br/>Jeff: Colby, you've taken a lot of people out of this  game. <br/>Tina: What's wrong with this picture, Colby? <br/>Colby: All the Ogakor. What is wrong with this? I'm jumping ship. <br/>Jeff: Here we go, guys. Ready... aim... fire. <br/>Colby: You're gone, Rodg. <br/>Jeff: Rodger's out of the game. Here's where we're at. Elisabeth, two plates perfectly intact. Colby down to one already nicked. Another winger will take it out. <br/>Amber: Elisabeth, you've got a lot of pressure on you,  girl. <br/>Which one are you going for, Elisabeth? There's three plates up there. <br/>Jeff: Ready... aim... fire. Oh...  Elisabeth: Oh, boy. <br/>Jeff: You're down to one plate each. Take your time and your shot. This is for immunity. Ready... aim... fire. Elisabeth's out of the game. Colby, this is becoming a regular thing. <br/>Colby: Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Congratulations. Well, good luck with your camp. You'll have fire after tonight's tribal council. Okay, guys, I'll see you tonight. <br/>Keith: Going to tribal council is not a fun thing. I mean, you have no real good reason for picking to vote  somebody off other than you're trying to get to the end. <br/>Amber: It's sad to see another person go out of your  group. You know, it's less people, less comfort, less conversations. I never ever look forward to going to tribal council, never. I hate it. <br/>Elisabeth: This group has really endured a lot and  persevered through some really torrential natural problems. Tribal council becomes really tough. I think this is going to be one of the toughest ones I've had to  go to. <br/>Jeff: We out now bring in the go to. <br/>Jeff: We out now bring in the jury: Alicia, Jerry and  Nick. I'll just remind you, the jury's not to be addressed. They won't be addressing you, just gathering information. So when you last left here, I said, "I wish for you dry  weather and no rain." Obviously, my rain dance didn't work out too well. Rodger, there are two seasons in the outback-- dry season, the  wet season. This landscape has changed from brown to green since we've been  here. Yet you guys put your camp in the mouth of a dry river bed. Whose idea was it to put it there? <br/>Rodger: It was not my idea. I was wanting to go up on the hill and build. But when the two tribes merged at that time, we took a  consensus, and mostly the females thought the sand would sleep better. I sure do wish we had went with mine. And then there was another one or two that felt like we  should've went up on the hill, too. But we did all pull together today. I mean, everybody pitched in and we're going to be all right. <br/>Jeff: Elisabeth, how much more difficult is this than what  you expected? <br/>Elisabeth: I can say this: every single day, especially  within the past four days, each one has gotten exponentially more challenging  and difficult. And I have gone from playing this game challenge-to-challenge to  playing it day-to-day, and now I just play it minute-tominute. <br/>Keith: After experiencing what we experienced last night,  it's hard to put the game into focus. No one person could've stayed warm by themselves last night. It took every person together. <br/>Jeff: Tina, you seem to be playing the political game--  which it is still very political-- but in as friendly a manner as you can. Was that a plan all along? <br/>Tina: For me, that was exactly my plan. And I would rather spend the last couple of weeks with people  who get along, are team players and you know, want to see each other do well. And to me, that just means more. <br/>Jeff: Let me follow that up, then. Is it fair to say that out of the 16, the six most deserving are  still here? <br/>Tina: Um... I don't know if I could say that the six most  deserving, but I can say that the six that are remaining are... you know,  these people are all deserving, every one of them. <br/>Jeff: Well, you guys have obviously bonded as Barramundi,  a new tribe. But I'd be remiss if I didn't point out the fact there's still  four Ogakor members and two Kucha. Rodger, you've been pretty secure every time you've come to  tribal council. Still feeling that secure tonight? <br/>Rodger: Oh, no. The only way I would feel secure is if I was wearing this  necklace that Colby's wearing. And you never know what's going to happen when you come here. And I do think that eventually the Kucha tribe will be an  extinct tribe, somewhere down the line. <br/>Jeff: Well, Colby's on a run, that's for sure. <br/>Rodger: He certainly is. <br/>Jeff: You're the only person who can't be voted for  tonight, yet you still get a vote. Good place to be. Let's vote. Elisabeth, you're up. <br/>Elisabeth: Amber, this is my Elisabeth, you're up. <br/>Elisabeth: Amber, this is my toughest vote yet. It has to be done, nothing personal. <br/>Rodger: Really a sweet girl, personal. <br/>Rodger: Really a sweet girl, very tough decision for me to  make. <br/>Colby: Rodger, just sticking with the batting order. <br/>Amber: Rodger, I just want to thank you for all the  comfort that you've brought into camp. It was like having a dad around. I'm going to hate to see you go. I'm going to miss you a lot. <br/>Keith: You're a really tough competitor, and at this stage  of the game, you're hard to beat. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are tallied, the votes. Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final. The person voted out of the tribe will be asked to leave the  tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Rodger. Amber. Rodger. Amber. Two votes Amber, two votes Rodger. Three votes Amber. Last vote... Amber. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Amber: I'll miss you guys. Stay strong. <br/>Jeff: Amber, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Well, based on tonight's vote, I guess it's very clear the old  tribal lines of Kucha and Ogakor are gone. Take your new fire, head back to camp and try to get a good  night's sleep. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes night's sleep. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode and hear  what Amber has to say. Next time on Survivor... A reward challenge brings messages from  home. <br/>Elisabeth: I can't even contain myself. <br/>Jeff: Is that a little tear in your eye? "We miss you and we're very proud of you." But it's  not one happy family back at camp. <br/>Colby: Keith is cooking way too much rice. Said the brown rice yields less. <br/>Keith: No, I said you have to use more water. <br/>Colby: The guy's a bozo. My game with Keith is done, it's over. <br/>Amber: I don't hold anything against anybody. You guys were the best five people I could have spent my last  couple of nights with. I'm actually kind of relieved. Those last couple of nights were really, really rough. I'm very proud of myself to make it this far, and I'm going to  be thinking about you guys a lot. You're going to be in my prayers and thoughts. I will never, ever, ever, regret anything that's happened here.
