<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously, on... J.T. and Boston Rob go at it hard. ...Survivor: Coach takes a hard hit. By day 12, it was all-out war between the Heroes and the Villains... Whoa! Stop, stop! ...and James was the latest casualty. But the biggest battle was back at the Villains' camp. Parvati was fighting for her life. <br/>Move your arms like this. <br/>Parvati is the most dangerous player on our tribe. <br/>Probst: Meanwhile, Russell and Rob battled it out for tribal supremacy. <br/>It's personal with me and Rob. He thinks he's tough? May the best man win. <br/>Probst: Russell believed he was in an alliance with Danielle and Parvati, and  he had the hidden immunity idol. Rob believed he was aligned with everyone else. Rob jumps down on the final piece! Villains win immunity! But when Rob led the Villains to yet another victory, his battle with Russell  was postponed. Villains, congratulations. While the Heroes were marching into another vote, James' injury made him a  liability, and Candice considered voting with the outsiders, Tom and Colby,  to take him out. <br/>You can't lug around dead weight-- and James is a lot of dead weight. <br/>Probst: But at Tribal Council she played it safe and voted with the majority  to take out Tom... The tribe has spoken. ...making Colby the odd man out in a tribe going nowhere fast. 15 are left. 15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Really? <br/>At Tribal tonight, Tom went home, and, uh... I voted for him because there's  no reason to throw a vote away and make the people that are going to be  people that are going to be coming home tonight mad at me. coming home tonight mad at me. <br/>Everyone's annoyed with Candice. <br/>In reality, nobody trusts her. She was gunning for James. I'm so sick of Candice right now. now. So... Candice has to go. So... Candice has to go. <br/>I'm just sitting around and... thinking too much. I don't want to be at your throat, I don't want you to be at my throat. I've decided to have a conversation with Rob to make him think that I'm not  after him, which I am. I don't care how strong he is. I don't care who he is. He's threatening Russell Hantz-- when you do that, you go. <br/>A lot of people are mad, though, that you went looking for that idol...  because we all said nobody's gonna look for it, and if they were, then you're  going to be marked. <br/>I went looking for it, but... if I get the next clue, I'll find it, 'cause  I'll go looking find it, 'cause I'll go looking for it again. for it again. <br/>Russell's going to find out soon enough that he's out of his league. I just did everything I could to make him as more paranoid as I could, to see  he runs around I could, to see he runs around like a crazy man. like a crazy man. ...but a lot of people are mad that you went looking for that idol. They want your ass off. He's not playing with the amateurs anymore. He's playing with the big boys now. I'm just telling you, watch I'm just telling you, watch your back, man. your back, man. <br/>Well, same thing for you, man. [laughs] man. [laughs] Watch your back. Watch your back. Watch your back. <br/>All right. <br/>All right. <br/>All right. [theme song playing] [theme song playing] [theme song playing]  Treemail! <br/>Yay! <br/>"When things look desperate, never lose hope. Never throw in the towel, you just have to cope. And never, ever give up, even when you're at the end of your rope."  Doesn't say whether it's for reward or immunity. Treemail was a bit vague this morning. We don't know whether it's reward, immunity or both. The biggest question to me is, what does it mean for James? I would put a whole lot of money on the fact that there will be challenges in  our future that James simply will not be able to do... not be able to do...  because of his injury. because of his injury. because of his injury. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Villains getting your first look at the new tribe of Heroes. Tom voted out at the last Tribal Council. <br/>[whispers]: James is still  [whispers]: James is still there. there. <br/>Probst: Danielle... surprised at this vote? <br/>Yes, definitely. We for sure thought James would be gone, but he must have a strong alliance  on the other side. <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: First things first. Sandra? [Sandra chuckles] I'll take it back. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. Today it's a little different. Today you'll be competing as individuals... against your own tribe, seeking  to win... individual immunity, which will keep you safe at tonight's Tribal  Council-- because tonight both tribes are going to Tribal Council. <br/>[whispers]: Wow! <br/>Probst: Both tribes are voting somebody out. This is your chance to make sure it is not you. So both tribes will run this challenge separately. Here's how it works. Each person will be attached to a long rope that is threaded through a series  of obstacles. You'll climb over, crawl under, maneuver around those obstacles as you make  your way to the finish. First person to the finish wins individual immunity, is safe at Tribal  Council. After both tribes have run this challenge, the two winners-- one from each  tribe-- will then square off in a showdown. The winner of thatchallenge wins for their tribe hot dogs, fixin's, soft  drinks, which you will enjoy tonight as you listen in on the other tribe's  Tribal Council. So you not only win food, you get insight into the dynamics of the other  tribe. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: A lot at stake. One thing of note. Coach, J.T. and Tyson all competed in this challenge in their season. J.T. and Tyson went on to the final; Tyson ultimately won this challenge. All right, we'll rock, paper, scissor to see who goes first. scissor to see who goes first. We'll get started. We'll get started. Villains won the rock, paper, scissor. They want the Heroes to go first. Fighting for individual immunity. Survivors ready? Go! You got to follow the rope through the course. Your body has to go wherever that rope goes. You're going to have to throw yourself through this course if you want a shot  at winning. James, even with a bad knee, is fighting to stay in this. <br/>Man! <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: Definitely affecting his mobility, but not his spirit. Amanda now in the lead. Candice right there in it. There are going to be a lot of scrapes, bumps, bruises when scrapes, bumps,  bruises when this is over. this is over. James now in the lead in this challenge. Who would have ever predicted this? <br/>Amazing! <br/>Probst: It is J.T., Candice, Rupert and James. Colby still stuck in the middle. Hung up. Amanda falling behind. Candice through the first section before anybody else! J.T. now through the first section. It's J.T. and Candice! Individual immunity on the line. Only way to make sure you're safe tonight is to win this. Amanda now in the second section. Rupert now in the second section. Candice wins individual Candice wins individual immunity! immunity! <br/>Candice is the only thing stopping Colby from going home next, and when she  won immunity he had to be thinking, "You know what? I just done me in."  Probst: Candice, congratulations. Candice safe at tonight's Tribal Council. I'll take a hug. Everybody else unbelt, take your spots on the bench, Villains, we'll get you  hooked up. up. Nice work. Nice work. All right, next round. Villains now fighting for individual immunity. Survivors ready? Go! See if they learned anything by See if they learned anything by watching the  Heroes do it first. watching the Heroes do it first. Rob and Tyson throwing themselves through this challenge. Russell squirming through this fairly quickly. Danielle trying to make a go of it. Parvati's right there in it. Sandra stuck early. Jerri struggling to get through. You cannot be timid in this challenge. It will not work. Right off the bat, it is Rob, Tyson, Russell. Parvati doing very well. Sandra making no progress at all. Coach launches himself through this. Rob's still fighting. Danielle trying to stay in it. Parvati is in this. It's Parvati, Russell, Tyson, Rob and Coach leading the way right now. Boston Rob is through the first section first. Tyson now through to the second section. It is Boston Rob and Tyson! Russell now through to the second section! Boston Rob, Tyson, Russell battling for individual immunity! Boston Rob is through! Boston Rob is through! Boston Rob wins immunity! Boston Rob wins immunity! Rob, congratulations. Rob is safe at tonight's Tribal Council for the Villains. You will now take on Candice in a showdown. Unhook. Unhook. We'll move on to the showdown. We'll move on to the showdown. Here we go. For the showdown round, we have Boston Rob from the Villains taking on  Candice from the Heroes. Winner of this challenge wins hot dogs and soft drinks which you will enjoy  tonight while listening in on the other tribe's Tribal Council. Survivors ready. Go. <br/>Go, Boston Rob! <br/>You got it, Rob! <br/>You got it, Rob! You got it! <br/>Focus, Candice! <br/>Probst: We've added a third level to this challenge, and it is three times as  high. This is going to be a lot more difficult than the first round. <br/>Come on, Candice! <br/>It's all you, Rob. It's all you. <br/>Probst: Rob with a bit of a lead, but Candice right on his tail. Both Rob and Candice are safe for the vote tonight. They're fighting now to win food for their tribe. <br/>Go steady, girl! <br/>Go...  Keep it going, Rob. Keep it going. <br/>Probst: Not only do you win food, you win the right to get a little insight  into the dynamics of the other tribe. <br/>Awesome, Rob! You look great. <br/>Rob, go. <br/>Probst: Rob still with the lead, but Candice still right there. Candice has not lost much ground. <br/>Right on his butt. You're right on his butt. <br/>Come on, Candice! You're right there. Don't give up now! Come on! You're right on him. <br/>Probst: A lot of support from both tribes. <br/>Great job, Rob! Great job. <br/>Good job. You're doing awesome! <br/>Really good job. <br/>Come on, girl! This is your honeymoon, girl! <br/>Come on, Candice! You're right there! <br/>Your honeymoon night, baby. Come on, girl. <br/>Steady, girl. <br/>Stay focused! Yes! <br/>Nice! <br/>Probst: Rob getting very close now. <br/>Good job, Rob! Good job, Rob! <br/>Probst: Candice got to pick it up. <br/>Come on, Rob. You got it, man. It's all you! <br/>Probst: Rob with the last move. Rob wins for the Villains! [cheering and applause] Villains will eat tonight at Tribal Council. <br/>You get the biggest hot dog! Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right, so here's how it's going to work. Villains, you will go to Tribal Council first, where Boston Rob has immunity,  cannot be voted out. After you've completed your Tribal Council, we will serve you hot dogs and  soft drinks as you listen in on the Heroes' Tribal Council, where Candice has  immunity, cannot be voted out. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you both at Tribal Council. <br/>I can certainly see where the tribe might decide I'm the weak link, so my gut  tells me I'll be going home tonight. But you never know what your future holds. There's so much that's truly up There's so much that's truly up to those  you're playing with. to those you're playing with. <br/>Boston Rob saves the day! <br/>Hot dog! [whooping]  Nice work, Rob! <br/>Ooh, I beat a girl. <br/>I know. <br/>I feel so... [roars]  Feel like a big man? Feel like a big man? <br/>Job well done. <br/>I went into that immunity challenge thinking, I have to win this one, and  then Rob wins! And I'm, like, "What?! No!" Rob having the immunity necklace puts him in a big position of  power. <br/>...like the other day. <br/>Gather round, gather round. <br/>What is it? <br/>Settled on Parvati, everybody? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>But we have to make sure they think it's Russell so that he plays the idol. [indistinct chatter]  Yeah. <br/>Russell sucks me this way, Tyson and Boston Rob pull me this way. You know, I'm totally the middleman. I'm smack dab in the center of two alliances, but we all know that the dragon  slayer is a man of his word, and when he says he's going to go this  direction, come hell or high water, that's who I'm voting for. I'm voting for Parvati. <br/>Let's get her out of here. I'm over it. I'm over it. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Just be careful, man, because I'm telling you, if you really don't have that  idol, you need to go get it. <br/>I don't have it. <br/>Well... it's been real. <br/>So, you're-you're telling me, uh...  I'm telling you...  ...if I don't find the idol, they'll vote for me tonight? <br/>Better to play with me than against me. <br/>Boston Rob tells me, "It's better to play with me than against me."  Oh, really? I believe I'm going to get him I believe I'm going to get him to eat them  words. to eat them words. <br/>Rob told me it's going to be me. I ain't stupid. They're going to vote Parvati. But this is what I want to do. I want to put Tyson's name down. I want to give you the idol tonight. If it doesn't work, I go home, but I ain't that stupid. but I ain't that stupid. They're trying to blindside you. They're trying to blindside you. <br/>I needed an A-plus performance today, and it didn't happen. James-- with a brace and all-- managed to beat me. So, uh, not an impressive So, uh, not an impressive showing, uh, for me today. showing, uh, for me today. Well, I just want to say one thing, guys. I know I'm going home tonight, so there's no... there's no need for any  scrambling or anything like that. There's absolutely no hard feelings on my part. So let's just have a good, relaxed afternoon and go on in there tonight. I say we give them as little information as we can. information as we can. They're going to be sitting in. They're going to be sitting in. I see the pecking order, and since Candice had sealed up immunity, I'm the  next one to go... Enjoyed it, Rupe. ...so I just said, "Listen, enjoy our afternoon, head to Tribal Council  tonight." Tribal Council tonight." Um... and I meant it. Um... and I meant it. ...I haven't had a lot of fun, I mean, I still love this game, I mean, I  still love this game, you know? you know? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Granted, I still think I can kick your ass. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>But you-you the Great Colby. <br/>But you-you the Great Colby. <br/>It wasn't too good today,  It wasn't too good today, that's for sure. that's for sure. that's for sure. <br/>Right. <br/>Right. <br/>You know what I'm saying? <br/>I hear you. <br/>Colby doesn't want to be here. There's no way that's the Colby of old-- one of the baddest competitors ever. He has not done anything. It is bring... almost brought me to tears. It's like my Superman sucks. All his muscles are gone, so it's very disappointing just to see a grown man  give it up like see a grown man give it up like that. that. <br/>We're losing our team. <br/>I mean, Colby's a good guy. <br/>I know. <br/>I know. <br/>But even with James' leg, my foot, Colby was last. <br/>I'm just... I'm really shocked that Colby hasn't really pulled through in  anything yet. You know? <br/>I know. <br/>But, still, James is hurt. <br/>We just got to decide which one of these is going to suit us best, because  even the... You know, we all had an alliance with James, but... I mean, even  James knows, at I mean, even James knows, at this point, we have to win. this point, we have to win. <br/>He's a competitor. Like, no matter what will happen, he will give his all until we win, but we  do need to...  But see...  But if you're giving your all, and your knee blows out, our five has to be  the strongest possible five we could have. We just have to think, you know...  We have to think who's been overall best competitor, given the circumstances  right now. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Is what we have to do. <br/>Is what we have to do. <br/>Well, how is it going to help me? I mean...  I'm serious. And you can't steal any more bananas when we come to camp. <br/>Steal any more bananas? What the ...  You're taking bananas when we come into camp. <br/>Everybody eats bananas. What does that mean? <br/>James, you take three of them. <br/>Yeah. I'm...  You're pissing people off. I'm just telling you what's going on. James just has to prove that he's okay. They're also mad about it, 'cause James, like... He tends to take a lot of  bananas 'cause he's a big guy. Like, he's hungry, obviously, but you know, you're out here with no food--  it's a big deal to people. <br/>Everybody eats bananas. It's so...  Yeah, but when you get a banana, you get one for everyone else. It's, like, an etiquette. <br/>Really? <br/>Yes. <br/>I mean, I understand. Whatever. <br/>Well, I want to know exactly what you can do, because if you show them,  you're fine, then you're fine. They want you here. Everyone wants you here. But if there is a chance that you're not okay...  Well, yeah, there might be, but, uh... I don't know. It's up to y'all. <br/>Ugh. <br/>Ugh. <br/>I'm tired of the talking. <br/>I'm tired of the talking. <br/>I'm tired of the talking. <br/>What's up? <br/>What's up? <br/>James wants to show us that he's tough. <br/>Oh, God. Are you serious? [Rupert chuckles]  Who am I racing? <br/>If you're racing me, you already won. [laughing]  We're about to have a race. He's going to show us that his leg is okay. Who do we keep? James, who is fighting to stay in the game? Or Colby, who's ready to walk out. <br/>So I'm running in this thing, huh? <br/>Yeah, I damn sure ain't running by myself! [Rupert laughs] I wanted to prove to y'all that I'm all right. Straight up. I mean... &gt; I don't want to see James go. James is a hundred percent ally on my side. Colby is not. I'm just gonna say, "Ready, go." James is a fighter. Colby is not. James is power. Ready? Colby is not. Go! [Rupert grunting]  Damn it! [Rupert laughing]  You all right? <br/>Damn it! You got me! Nah, I'm good. It don't hurt. <br/>James is not the kind of person that's gonna say, "You know what, I don't  think I can go anymore." You'll never know it until the man's in a  stretcher that he was hurt. <br/>You still would have beat me. <br/>We have to see the big picture here, look outside of our friendships and find...  the winning combination. <br/>Hey, J.T., would you like a banana? banana? [laughing] [laughing] [laughing]  Yes, my love? <br/>Yes, my love? <br/>No. We need to split the vote. I'm telling you, three of us vote for Parvati, three of us vote for Russell. The three of them are going to put somebody up, probably you. I'm telling you, if we vote three and three and there's a tie, then there's a  revote. That means either one of those two are going home. If he plays the idol, then she's going home. If he gives her the idol, he's going home. Do you understand? We can't lose. You can't lose that way. This other way, it's too risky. I was just thinking to myself, you know, Tyson's one of my allies, and if it  were me that didn't win immunity they'd be coming after me, and I know  they're coming after him, and I was just thinking of a way so that Russell  doesn't get the better of us if he does have the idol. <br/>It's Parvati first option, Russell second option. <br/>Basically, I threw out an insurance policy, if you will. There's no way they can backdoor us with the idol, and we'll all be safe. As long as we split our votes, one of them two goes home. <br/>That's it. <br/>I think the vote's going to be pretty... pretty straightforward tonight. Rob, myself, Sandra, we're voting for Russell. Courtney, Coach and Jerri are voting for Parvati. <br/>Don't sweat it. I'm telling you. <br/>It's not rocket science, but I don't have immunity, and anytime I don't have  immunity I feel a little uneasy. Let me see you for a second, Tyson. Tyson. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. <br/>I know. <br/>And I just wanted to tell you I'll do what I have to do to stay in the game. There's nothing I can do to help her. So I'm going to vote for Parvati. <br/>Yeah, you need to. <br/>And then... that'll be it. She'll go home. You know, if there's any way I could've tried to save her, I would have, but  I started thinking, you know, I got to play this game for myself. <br/>Okay. When Russell came and told me that he wanted to vote out Parvati, I thought  it was actually an excellent opportunity maybe to swap my vote to Parvati. I mean, I want her out. <br/>Man, I don't like doing it, but... got to. <br/>I hope there's not a revote, but I just want to get it over with and get some  hot dog in my mouth. <br/>All right, man. <br/>Yep. We're tight, dude. <br/>You know, the smartest thing for them to do is make it a three-way tie. That would force the idol. Then they can play however they want to play on the second vote. That would be a genius move. I don't know they're that smart. I don't know if it would be the right thing giving Parvati the idol. It's just... this is a really tough decision here. Way worse than last time. It's... it is really bad. it is really bad. <br/>Probst: Jerri, going all the way back to season two, what is one significant  way Survivor's changed? <br/>It's, like, you get out here and it's game on. Like, trying to create alliances, that sort of thing, right from the get-go,  and it seems like the typical survival things, now they're not as important. <br/>Probst: Rob, what's another element that's different now that we didn't have  back in season four? <br/>Hidden immunity idols. That puts a whole other twist in the game. I mean, you can use it to protect yourself, to protect somebody else. You don't know whether somebody has it or not. has it or not. <br/>We all know who has it. <br/>We all know who has it. Russell, if you don't have it and you didn't find it, you'd best look for it. Point-blank. <br/>Probst: So, Russell, there's at least one person in here who's certain you  have it, and if you don't, that makes it tough for you. <br/>Not really. I mean, if you ain't got it, you can't play it. So it don't make it too tough for me. <br/>Probst: Tyson, do you think it's better if you do have the idol, or it's  something you really want nothing to do with it? <br/>Well, I guess it can help you in some instances, but when the numbers are  this big still, it's... it's not gonna be that beneficial. <br/>Probst: Parvati, as a tribe, you guys have done very well. But still, there have to be things about each person on this tribe that  you're a little suspect of, shady about. What's the take on Tyson? <br/>Tyson's a threat, because he's really charming and he's funny and he also has  connections with Coach, with J.T. on the other side. He's tight with Rob, he's tight with Sandra. Tyson's a huge threat. <br/>Probst: Sandra, what's the big concern about Parvati? <br/>Well, we keep going back to the fact that she has connections on the other  side. <br/>Probst: Courtney, what's the take on Rob? <br/>There seems to be a polarizing affect. People either like him, or they're really bugged by him. You know, he's at the center of controversy a lot of times. <br/>Probst: All right, well, there's at least a couple of people clearly on the  hot seat, and what appears to be a fair amount of uncertainty about which way  this vote was going to go. Let's get to it. Rob has the immunity necklace around his neck. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Cannot vote for Rob. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. It's time to vote. Danielle, you're up. Danielle, you're up. Danielle, you're up. <br/>Welcome to the big leagues. <br/>Welcome to the big leagues. <br/>You're so damn charming, and that's what makes you dangerous. That and your friends on the other side. other side. Night-night. Night-night. <br/>You need to get in the ocean and wash your ass. I can't stand you, and I can't wait for you to go home. wait for you to go home. Adios. Adios. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody does have the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now  would be the time play it, now would be the time to do so. to do so. <br/>Probst: If anybody does have the hidden immunity idol and you want to play  it, now would be the time to do so. <br/>I think I'm gonna take the  I think I'm gonna take the target off of my back. target off of my back. You know, Coach, you always say loyal, honesty and trust is the best thing. No matter how this comes out tonight, I'm gonna stick to that. Parvati. <br/>Are you serious? <br/>Are you serious? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. I guess I'm playing it. I guess I'm playing it. Such a gentleman. <br/>Probst: The rules of Survivor state that if a hidden immunity idol is played,  then any votes cast against that person will not count, and the person with  the next highest number of votes will be voted out. This is, indeed, a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Parvati will not count. This is a bold move by Russell. This is a bold move by Russell. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote... First vote... Russell. Russell. Russell. Russell. Two votes Russell. Two votes Russell. Parvati. Parvati. Does not count. Does not count. Parvati. Parvati. Does not count. Does not count. Parvati. Does not count. We're still at two votes Russell. Parvati. Does not count. Tyson. That's two votes-- Russell, one vote-- Tyson. Tyson. We're tied. Two votes-- Russell, two votes-- Tyson. One vote left. Sixth person voted out of Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains... Villains... Tyson. Tyson. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: Tyson, the tribe has spoken. spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. Well, that was definitely a crazy Tribal Council. In a moment, we're going to bring in the Heroes for their Tribal Council,  which you will get to listen in on while enjoying hot dogs and soft drinks. I'll give you a moment to move I'll give you a moment to move your torches,  we'll get started. your torches, we'll get started. <br/>Oh, man, I have nobody to blame but myself. I was the victim of my own stupidity. Russell probably gained a little bit of respect and a little bit of power by  his risky move today. Giving the idol to Parvati was kind of a shocker. It ended up being my demise. I wish I would have stuck to the split vote. I would have come out victorious, and Russell would have gone home. What you gonna do? What you gonna do? I'm still pretty awesome. I'm still pretty awesome. <br/>Probst: Heroes getting your first look at the new Villain tribe. Tyson voted out of tonight's Tribal Council. All right, Heroes, as you know, part of the reward of today's challenge-- the  Villains earned the right to sit in and listen in on your Tribal Council and  enjoy hot dogs and soft drinks. [thunder rumbling] You guys can remove the covers You guys can remove the  covers and get started. and get started. <br/>Damn. [rain falling]  Don't drop the buns. <br/>This is so evil. <br/>Wasn't our idea. <br/>Buns. [laughter]  Probst: Rupert, you haven't taken your eyes off that food, even while I'm  asking you the question. <br/>No. I would have already had a couple of them dogs down. [rolling thunder] [loud, rumbling thunder]  Yes, at least it's raining on y'all parade. <br/>Probst: Rupert, sitting this close to the entire tribe of Villains, it's kind  of a reflection of where we're at in this game. This tribe is dwindling. They're still full, so to speak. <br/>Literally and physically, they are. You know, the line between Hero and Villain is so blurred right now. The Villains are showing the Heroes how the hell this game is supposed to be  played. <br/>Probst: James, let's talk about today's challenge. There's a big sort of question surrounding you. Was there any talk about, "You did great, man. I'm so glad we kept you," or was there even a question? <br/>There were questions. And then, I had to race J.T., and I lost, so I gave up...  Probst: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You raced J.T.? <br/>I really want the best for the tribe, and I don't want to obligate anybody to  keep me over here, so, I'm like this. "Let's go get it, let's have a race." Well, I sucked, and the dude  from Alabama beat me. <br/>Probst: Amanda, to be fair, I would think a lot of people would lose, in a  foot race, to J.T. <br/>It's something to consider, because if we have a challenge tomorrow, that's  running. I mean, it's on everyone's mind. <br/>Probst: Colby, the last few Tribal Councils, you've been on the outside of  the conversations, you've been in disagreement with the vote, and you've  said, "Sooner or later, it will be me." What do you do in a game  like this? Can you scramble? <br/>I just went back to camp and sat down and had a conversation with James about  how bad we both want to be in this game, 'cause we're the two guys in  question. <br/>Probst: Did you get the feeling from James that he definitely wanted to still  be in this game? <br/>Absolutely, and he asked me the same thing. <br/>Probst: So, James, you weren't sure. <br/>This is pretty much one of the baddest survivors ever growing up. <br/>I'm not that old! <br/>But you know what I mean! [laughter] Watching the show forever. I get here, he got slammed by the dragon slayer. Picked up and brought in the van. Today, he got beat by a cripple and fat dude on an obstacle course. It's like finding out Superman was in a big girdle. You see the muscles, and you get up close, and it's nothing but a fat suit. So, I'm, like, "Honestly, do you want to be here? 'Cause if not, I'll stay here, 'cause I like it here." Some of us are  doers, and some of us are sayers. I'm more of a doer. Like, they told me today, there's such a thing as a banana etiquette. <br/>Probst: Banana etiquette? <br/>If you go get a banana, you have to ask every person who's in your vicinity  if they would like a banana. [laughter] Which is great, but in my world, if your ass is hungry, you go get  a banana. [laughter]  Probst: Colby, what's it like to hear James say, it's like seeing Superman is  wearing a fat suit? <br/>I mean, hearing that's certainly not as bad as living it. You know, that's the worst. I mean, it's a reality. It's a reality. Up to this point, I have not performed as well as I would have hoped to. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to get to the vote, which means, Villains,  finish what's in your mouth...  Ha-ha! <br/>Probst: Grab your torches,  Probst: Grab your torches, head back to camp. head back to camp. <br/>Oh, my God, there's bread up  Oh, my God, there's bread up there. there. <br/>Probst: All right, Candice, you have the individual immunity necklace. <br/>Keeping it. <br/>Probst: Cannot vote for Candice. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. It's time to vote. Rupert, you're up. Rupert, you're up. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote-- Colby. First vote-- Colby. James. One vote-- Colby, one vote-- James. James. Two votes-- James, one vote-- Colby. James. That's three votes-- James, one vote-- Colby. Seventh person voted out of Heroes vs. Villains--James. That's four. That's enough. That's enough. You need to bring your torch. You need to bring your torch. You need to bring your torch. <br/>Bye, babe. <br/>Bye, babe. <br/>Probst: James, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Have a shot for us. <br/>Oh, I'm going to be good and  Oh, I'm going to be good and drunk in the next five minutes. drunk in the next five minutes. <br/>Probst: Well, from the sounds of tonight's Tribal Council, an alliance was  broken, and hopefully, a tribe was unified. Grab your torches, head back to camp. camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor. Without his idol, nothing can save Russell from the wrath of Rob. <br/>He's dangerous. Anybody that gives away immunity and leaves himself blank-- it's like a  suicide bomber. You can't stop someone like that. If they don't care about their own fate in the game, that's a wild card. wild card. He'll do anything. He'll do anything. <br/>I have banana etiquette. That's just a little bit too much. But hopefully, they can finally pacify Colby into actually being a teammate,  and actually having the team together. Hopefully, they'll do better. But it's a game. It was fun. I just happened to have bad luck on this thing with injuries. And they got me a little bit And they got me a little bit earlier than they  should have.
