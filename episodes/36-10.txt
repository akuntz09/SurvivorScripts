<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," facing tribal council, Desiree was  willing to jump ship on her alliance.  I'm ready to take out Kellyn, Wendell, and dom.  Jeff: But lauren warned dom.  Oh, my God. Things are about to go bust out here.  Jeff: At tribal council, Domenick, Wendell, and Kellyn struck first. Desiree,  the tribe has spoken. Ten are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning  funded by cbs  tribal council was quite the dramatic scene. It was a huge challenge to figure  out who is telling the truth and who is lying. Laurel had told me that the Naviti  girls were looking the take myself, Kellyn, and Wendell out of this game, so  thank God for Laurel.  I just want to say thank you for saving my ass.  Thank you for saving me.  Listen, if you didn't do what you did, one of us would be gone. I appreciate  it.  For the first time I feel really great about my spot in the game. I feel like  I have just locked in protection from Kellyn, Domenick, and Wendell, because  I saved them tonight.  I apologize for having doubted you.  You guys had your reasons.  Yeah. Ongoing.  Even before this vote, it... I think that solidified you in the way that all  went down. It's a good group of people. Even though Laurel saved my life in  this game, I’m still not 100% sure I want to work with her moving forward. The  good news is Naviti is still ahead in the numbers, and that's how i'll get to  the end of the game, by staying Naviti strong.  If we do get another ripe papaya, I think we should do a free rice batch.  11 days. The finish line is in sight. It's crazy. I promise you. I promise  you.  Bro, bro, bro.  We'll put our brains together.  We can. We can.  It's obvious to everyone that Domenick and I are allies. It's obvious. Everyone  knows it. People have targeted us before. It's nothing new. But I don't think  people realize that Laurel and Donathan are also with us. We're all keeping  it on the low. I think that's our best strategy to get to the end.  Dom, if we go at each other, we're both going to die out here.  Yes.  Do you understand that in.  I completely 1,000% agree. We can't do that.  Wendell and i's relationship is crazy. We're really good friends. But I came  here to win this money for my family, so if it means I have to cut this bond  that I have with Wendell, that's a risk I’m willing to take when the time is  right.  I already have an idol in my possession, but Michael played an idol a couple  days ago, so if there is a new one planted on this island, I intend to get my  hands on it. I can't give up at this point. I need to do this for my wife and  my kids.  I have been living at this camp since day one, so I kind of know the  landmarks across the beach where I can look for trees that look suspicious in  some way or another. Or rocks that need to be placed somewhere that just  doesn't look normal. I think that's my one leg up on some of the other  players out here right now, and I’m passing this grove again, and I look down  and I see this coconut with an emblem on it. And I knew I struck gold. Feeling  the weight of it, it seems like something solid is in here. I can't wait to  have a moment to open it up. I got to lose this thing in a second. Congratulations.  You have found something that may offer you power, although it may not be the  power you expect. This is david's authentic fake idol that he used to fool  jay in Survivor's 33rd season.  Wow. This grove actually reminded me of the millennials general x season. Having  made it to the final six, jay did the same thing you just did.  How stupid.  He pick up a coconut and found david's fake idol.  There's another one.  Believing it to be real.  You got to be quicker than that.  Jay let his guard down. It was a costly mistake.  Jeff: This is a work of art but not a hidden immunity idol.  Jay was voted out that night.  Oh, my God.  This tainted idol has not matured into a real idol, so because it has no  power, there is no way to reverse the curse. Instead, your opportunity to  gain power lies in your ability to fool another player. The question is, are  you clever enough to pull it off. I’m going to stash this. David fooled jay  with this, and jay ended up going home that night. It was a beautiful play,  and it's something I hope I can replicate out here. The question is do I want  to just plant this idol somewhere or do I want to figure out a way to  specifically target someone? There's no one that's going to pull this off  better than I am.  Jeff: Come on in, guys! All right. You guys ready to get to today's immunity  challenge?  Yes, sir.  Jeff: First things first, Chelsea. I have to take back the necklace. Thank you.   All right. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,  you're going to pull up on a bar, clamping a ball between two sets of jaws. If  at any point you release the pressure, that ball will drop, and you're out of  the challenge. Today there's a twist. Because not one, but two people will  win immunity.  Oh, my God.  Jeff: And two people will be voted out tonight. Because we are having two  separate tribal councils.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Whoa.  Jeff: Here's how it's going to work: We're going to draw for two temporary  new tribes, five orange, five purple. The last person left standing for  orange wins immunity and is safe at their tribal council.  Whoa.  Jeff: The last person left standing for purple wins immunity, is safe at  their tribal council. So two people are going home, and for a little added  incentive to hang in there, the last person left standing for all ten of you  earns the right for their tribe to go to tribal council last, so they will  know who was voted out first.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  Jeff: All right. Do-or-die time. No Ghost Island today. Enough stakes. We're going  to draw for our two tribes. We'll get started. All right. We have our two  tribes. On one tribe, wearing orange, Michael, Laurel, Domenick, Wendell, and  Kellyn all competing against each other. One of the five going home tonight. On  the other five, Chelsea, Sebastian, Angela, Jenna, and Donathan. You are only  competing against each other, as well. One of you will win immunity. One of  you is going home. Everybody grab your handles. Lift up. All right. Everybody  is good and this challenge is on. A new challenge and another new twist for Survivor  in its 36th season. This is all about your arms. If you release the pressure,  that too will pull that handle down. Your ball will drop, an you'll be on the  sitout bench. Only five people on each tribe, immunity is so important tonight.  Kellyn now with her first slip. The slightest bit of release on that  pressure, that's all it takes. And Kellyn with a second drop. Kellyn is the  first out. Kellyn, no shot at immunity tonight. A deceiving challenge. As long  as you keep pulling up you will keep those jaws clamped. Michael drops, steps  off, Michael is out. Michael, no shot at immunity. Michael takes a spot on  the bench. That's how quickly it can happen. We are down to three for orange,  all five of the purple still in it and looking strong. The pressure will only  get worse from here. Because if you do release a little and that ball starts  to drop, it becomes that much more difficult to hold it up. And just like  that Donathan, one little move and he's out. We're down to four on purple,  three on orange. Laurel losing a little pressure. That ball inching closer  and closer to the end. Laurel drops. Laurel is out of the challenge. We are  down to two left on orange. Domenick and Wendell side by side battling for  that immunity necklace.  He will not beat me.  Jeff, I’m winning.  He's not going to beat me, jeff.  Jeff: A lot of talking. Further down wearing purple, Chelsea, Sebastian, Angela,  and Jenna battling for immunity.  It hurts.  Hold strong.  Jeff: Sebastian with his first slip. Jeab now with her first slip. Jenna with  another slip. Sebastian and Jenna both in trouble. Sebastian drops. He's out.  Jenna trying to readjust. No. Jenna drops. She's out. We are down to two on  each tribe. Individual immuneity for either Domenick and Wendell or either Chelsea  or Angela could be worth $1 million.  Hell, yeah.  Jeff: You've been out there 15 minutes. Wendell's arms now shaking. Domenick's  forearms moving. Angela has not moved at all. Chelsea, out of nowhere, her  ball starts to move. Chelsea struggling to stay in this. She's been strong  for a long time. Chelsea's whole body now moving. She's still in it, though. Angela  out of nowhere drops. Chelsea wins individual immunity. And that's all it  takes. Chelsea's out, and that means purple will be going to tribal council  first. She's safe either way. Now we have one showdown, Domenick versus Wendell.  Not only will you win immunity and be safe, you will go to tribal council  second and have the advantage of information.  I want that necklace.  Well, you got to stand up here for another thundershower get that necklace.  That's fine, I don't care.  Sorry, guys. He's stubborn.  I'm stubborn.  I got nowhere to go.  Neither do i, jeff.  Jeff: We've been out here over 30 minutes now. Wendell with a lot of  movement, but that ball is not moving.  Just end it already. Stop the nonsense. You know I’m not going anywhere.  Jeff: Domenick trying to seize with it the verbal assault.  I got eight brothers and sisters. We kill each other for the last chicken  nugget at the dinner table, jeff. You understand?  Uh-oh. It's starting.  I'm chilling. I’m chilling.  Jeff: First bit of movement.  Don't let it go.  Jeff: Domenick with his first movement. Wow, that got a look from Wendell.  I've been watching this show since day one. I’m putting this necklace on  tonight. This is mine. My wife and kids are sitting on that bench watching me  right now. I ain't losing.  Glen's my lucky color.  Jeff: Good. Domenick versus Wendell for all the marbles. This is just sheer  will. More movement from Wendell. Body shaking. Forearms burning.  Good luck, dom.  Jeff: Wendell drops out. Domenick wins individual immunity, safe tonight at  tribal council and earns the right for orange to go to tribal council second,  seeing what purple does when they go first. Chelsea, come on over. [applause]   good job, Chelsea.  Jeff: Second time in a row. Individual immunity is yours. You are safe  tonight. Domenick, come on over. Domenick safe tonight at tribal council.  Good job, dom.  Jeff: Chelsea cannot be voted out. Domenick cannot be voted out. Sadly Jenna,  accept, Angela, Donathan, you'll go to tribal council first where one of the  four of you will be voted out of this game. Then Kellyn, Michael, Laurel, Wendell,  one of you will be voted out. Two people going home tonight, two dreams  coming to an end. It will not be Chelsea. It will not be Domenick. Grab your  stuff. Head back the tribal. See you guys tonight. Congrats. Congrats.  I had to win this one, and I don't know really what happened. And now I’m up  against three original Naviti. I need to try and figure something out,  because I do not want to go home tonight.  Looking a little like deeãjaaã vu. Chels.  Congrats.  Thank you.  You're a true warrior.  You guys are so sweet.  Chelsea, dom, good job.  Appreciate it.  That was hard.  Going into tribal tonight, we have two groups of five. First one is Chelsea, Donathan,  Jenna, Sebastian and Angela.  That was definitely a twist, you guys, that I didn't see.  That was scary.  "Survivor" slapped us tonight.  I'm set up on my team with myself, Wendell, Laurel, Michael, and Kellyn.  Congrats.  So that's how it feels? So going into tonight the plan is to put votes on Michael.  It should be easy now. We can get rid of him. It shouldn't be an issue.  What's been the beach talk in what's going on for you guys?  Well, I hate the play my idol tonight, and that's the one decision I haven't  made up my mind about yet.  Coming back the camp, I know it's probably me going home, so I wanted to talk  to Donathan as soon as I could, because Donathan has an idol, and in my eye,  that's pretty much one of the only options I have left. Could I ask a favor  of you?  What?  Since we're in separate tribals tonight, would you let me borrow it just for  like the next hour to show one of them so they think I have one?  No.  You wouldn't?  No?  Because I don't want it linked back to me.  I know, but I don't see how it would. No one suspects...  It's in my bag and I have it packed away. Even though I like Michael, I can't  give Michael my idol. I’m out here the play for me and win $1 million. I have  to put my best interests first. I never want to let it slip I have an idol.  I'm having my own pity party. Donathan gave me a pretty republican and simple  answer, but I would have liked to have heard something different. So even  though it's a huge risk to lie, if I say I have an idol, I might be able to  leverage that to the best of my ability just to save myself for one more  night. If I can pull this off, it will be pretty freakin' sweet.  I have to really trust you 100%. Can i? I have an idol. I’m playing it  regardless. I’m not going home tonight.  Holy cow. He has an idol. I’m like, darn it. It feels like things are more  dangerous now than they ever have been.  Tonight if we can do this, I am with you for the long haul.  I have not had --  i'm with you for the listening haul if this happens. I’m dead serious.  I feel like she does believe I have the idol. I convinced her that I am  playing it tonight. You know, I have really didn't all I can I think, and at  this point, you know, it's hali mary. I hope my work pays off. I hope I stay  another day.  You're not telling Laurel you have the idol, right?  God no. We're good.  Michael has found two idols already in this game, so it's possible he has  another one. I’m really worried if Michael puts his vote on me, I’m going  home.  He says he has an idol.  He doesn't.  Are you sure?  I promise you. Look at my face. I know when someone is pulling the wool over  my eyes. He doesn't have one.  He said he found it the day after --  tell him to show it to you. Show it to me.  I'm not going home tonight.  Kellyn may be losing it, because I don't think Michael has an idol, so it's  risky, but I’m voting for Michael. This guy just won't go away. We need to  get rid of Michael.  I don't buy it. Look, I’m not a genius, but I’m a pretty good read. I don't  believe he has anything.  Domenick is reassuring me that I’m still safe. But I’m just so worried that Michael  has yet another idol. I am scared it might be me tonight, Chelsea.  Why?  Michael, mr. Idol finder. It just feels like he has one. I don't know. Truly it  does. I've been thinking I might vote Laurel. A vote for Laurel seems like a  safer bet because I don't think she has an idol. As long as Wendell feels  good with me, we can keep Naviti together. He has an idol. And he is playing  his idol tonight no matter what.  He is acting like he has one. That sounds believable.  Yep.  But...  I believe him. Are we willing the sacrifice Laurel if he does have that idol?   Kellyn, who gets super emotional, wants to place a vote on Laurel, but she  doesn't know that Laurel happens to be my ally, so I need to talk to Laurel  and see what's going on with her, because we need some kind of a plan. Today it  does seem like Michael has given up or he has something.  So if he pulled out an idol, then what would happen?  If you vote for Kellyn, she goes home.  And if I didn't, I go home.  Michael has shown himself to be a fierce competitor, so it makes sense to  vote for Michael, but if he pulls out an idol, I very well could be going  home. It's frustrating knowing my game comes down to whether or not Michael  has an idol.  What do you think I should do? I’m not thinking clear because I’m stressed  out because you don't want Kellyn out.  She can go whenever if you ask me.  Wendell and Domenick are two of my closest allies out here. I feel like right  now they need to protect me through this next vote and vote for Kellyn,  because Kellyn could try to flip on me and get me out.  I feel like I’m going to vote for Kellyn because it's the safest thing for  me.  Tonight it should be such a straight shot. I would like the see Michael going  to, but if I have to vote for Kellyn in order to save Laurel, I’m willing to  do that.  I feel so good. I’m not even worried.  The clock is ticking down, and I’m going back and forth on this all day. I have  my secret advantage that I won at Ghost Island, so I have an extra piece of  parchment where I can cross out mckayla's name and write down someone else,  and one extra vote is a huge power. So I’m going to use my extra vote  tonight, and put two votes on Laurel, just in case Michael does have an idol.   It should be straightforward, right?  I'm in the looking to do anything crazy. I want...  I feel like we should make sure our people understand.  Today has been super busy. Lots of conversations, lots of people walking  away, because there will be two tribal councils tonight. We have a few people  on our hit list, so my hope is that we could take both of them out in one  night. But I’m willing to make a big move out here. I’m willing to take risks  out here to protect my alliance.  I'm saying that if we're going to do it...  I don't know what's going on on that side, but obviously we have the numbers.   Yeah.  The five people on my tribe are me, Chelsea, Angela, Donathan, and Jenna. That's  two Malolo, three Naviti. We've literally had the numbers since day one. So I  couldn't be happier. Jenna is going home, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think we just have to be super freaking convincing.  We're going to vote for Jenna, and tell her that we're all voting for Donathan  straight up.  There's just so many different things running through my head, like what are  your opportunity and your chances of going home tonight? I’m on the same  tribe with Donathan, who has the idol. We're down on numbers. Being from Malolo,  we know we're on the bottom. We know we're on the chopping block. So I assume  that it's me or Donathan.  I think she was going to come down in a little bit.  Is there any way you can vote Donathan.  That's what we're doing. We're voting for Donathan. He's that swing vote that  nobody wants here.  This is where relationships do come into play. Chelsea and Sebastian seem to  be willing to keep me around again, so I want to make sure Donathan thinks  it's me so he doesn't play his idol on himself tonight, because if he does,  that means I’m going home and I do not want that. Sebastian is like we're  voting you.  It's worth a shot.  I know. This is the game. It's frustrating. But just know that I love you and  I’m glad we got to play this game together.  Sebastian said that he's going to vote Jenna out. I have my idol, so I can  feel like I’m safe, but i'd hate to see Jenna go. Maybe I can save her  tonight. You all right?  Yeah.  What's wrong?  I'm trying to get Wendell or Domenick to make a move on Kellyn.  I'm not sure if I want to play it on me or Jenna. It's nerve-racking for me. Laurel,  she's my greatest ally out here. She's on the other side. It sounds like Laurel  could actually go tonight, and that terrifies me. Malolo has had to struggle  throughout this whole thing. I would hate to see Jenna go, as well.  This game, this game.  I know. I know.  Sebastian -- I may use it on you.  Are you willing to play that idol?  If you're 100% with me right now.  Write down.  You'll find out?  I did a good job lying. Donathan was willing the play an idol for me. He's an  idiot and I’m willing to vote him out, so I have to act surprised when he  gets sent to the jury. I’m super grateful that he's willing to play it on me.   I told Jenna that i'd play that idol on you tonight, flu are so many  variables in this game. It depends on what my gut tells me at tribal tonight.  It's a huge risk for my game, but I think about how it was between tai and  scot, who didn't save a friend. I intend to reverse the curse for Malolo.  Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Chris, Libby, and Desiree  voted out at the last tribal council. So Donathan, huge twist today.  Definitely.  Jeff: You guys are divided into two temporary tribes. You're going to come to  tribal. You already know the question I’m going to ask.  It shook things up at camp. Me and Jenna is here. We have three Naviti around  us. So we're back where we was from the start.  Jeff: So Sebastian, is it a pretty simple vote, the Naviti are going to stick  together and Malolo is in trouble?  Yeah, Malolo's been getting the low end of the stick since the beginning of  this game, and you have to feel wad for them, because there's nothing they  can do, so, yeah, it's pretty obvious. There's three and a half information  and two Malolo here.  Jeff: And yet if you look at the jury, that hasn't been the case. There's two  Naviti and one Malolo. So Jenna, did there seem to be any cracks that you  could try to get into?  No cracks. The Naviti are staying strong. And it is pretty obvious that I’m the  one going home tonight. I’m ready to vote.  Jeff: Wow. Meaning you're done?  I'm not done, but i've been on the bottom this whole time, and today I was  super excited for the opportunity of two different tribal, but it's the same Naviti  strong. Everyone is honest an up front at camp.  Jeff: Sebastian, when you hear, that do you feel like, wow, I thought you'd  fight a little harder.  Yeah, that's very interesting that she said that. You want to fight to stay  in this game. That's a very blunt statement to make right off the bat.  Jeff: Donathan, hearing Jenna say it's me and I’m ready, is there a part of  you that says, okay, at least I’m still alive. It does, but there's always  tricks up people's sleesms you never know if they are telling you you're  staying, but Jenna could get the surprise of her life and it could be me  going tonight.  Jeff: Chelsea, why would that make sense when you have a 3-2? Is it because  the concern of idols?  When you have a 3-2 split, there is nothing you can do to save yourself if  either of these two had an idol. Essentially if you vote wrong, one of the Naviti  three that you think are strong is now going home.  Jeff: So Donathan, what did you do this afternoon to try to switch the Naviti  and make something else happen?  I think that these three Navitis might be scared to rub some of the other  ones the wrong way, so that's why me and Jenna are hopeless tonight.  Jeff: And Jenna, that brings us back to you and why you feel you have no  chance.  Yeah, it's definitely a Malolo tonight. Just based off of conversations I had,  my suspicions are it's me.  Jeff: So is this really all we need at tribal? Are you guys really ready to  vote? Wow. This may be the fewest questions i've ever asked at a tribal  council. All right. It is time to vote. Angela, you're up. Angela, you're up.  I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want  the play it, now would be the time to do so.  Jeff.  Oh, my God. Okay. So this is the super idol. This is the one that scot had,  and this is the one that tai had. They didn't get to complete their super  idol then, and I complete these two now. And it creates a regular idol, and I’m  going to save it. Sorry, Jenna. I’m playing this for myself tonight.  Jeff: Okay. Thanks, Donathan. When combined these two do form an idol. Any votes  cast for Donathan will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote Donathan. Does  not count. Sebastian. That's one vote Sebastian. Jenna. One vote accept, one  vote Jenna. Jenna. That's two votes Jenna, one vote Sebastian, one vote left.  11th person voted out and the fourth member of our jury, Jenna. You need to  bring me your torch. Jenna, the tribe has spoken. Jenna, tonight you can take  your spot immediately with the jury next to Desiree.  It's okay.  Jeff: All right. Your work here is done. Grab your torches. Head back to  camp. We'll bring in the next tribe. Go ahead and have a seat, and we will  get started.  Jeff: So let's start with first big news. You're getting your first look. Jenna  just voted out. Laurel, what does that say to you?  It sucks to see Jenna over, there because it shows Naviti continues the play  the same game they've been playing since we got here. We're in the same position.  I come here every day and say the same thing and it's the same story today.  Jeff: And yet Domenick just luck of draw, Naviti once again on paper has the  numbers.  It was crazy. We did a completely random draw for two teams, and once again Naviti  had the majority on both sides. It's just been the story this entire season.  Jeff: And Wendell, is it that simple?  It's either Michael or Laurel and just keep it clean?  That's the easy move.  Jeff: Kellyn, does that mean it's the right move?  You're playing "Survivor." do you think the easy move is ever the  right move? I don't know. It sounds easy, right? And then you think about the  idol king sitting over there, and so then you have to count numbers, and it's  scary. I am sitting here very, very scared.  Jeff: Wendell, is this a little bit like animals in the jungle with the  predator and prey. They get so good that they can sense when something is  off. Is that what you guys are talking about, that all of this centers around  whether or not you bereave one person has an idol and so what you're doing is  studying him to determine if he's telling the truth or not?  Absolutely, jeff. All eyes have been on mike federal day one.  I mean, look at the kid, first of all. Of course. You can at least own that.  Thank you, Kellyn.  Jeff: Domenick, you look like you want to say something.  I want to mention to the people i've been working out, I know Michael has a  strong history of idols of finding idols, but I think we shouldn't panic. I’m  sticking to my game plan, because I haven't seen anything at this point. And  I don't brief he has it.  Jeff: Michael, what would be the logic of showing him the idol given that  there are five and the only other choice is Laurel?  I don't know what logic. Maybe to sway the vote. Other than that it wouldn't  make a whole lot of sense. I mean, the prey can tell that predators are out  there, and I think it would be something i'd want the keep on the low and  just play the secure myself for one more time.  Fair enough.  Jeff: Laurel, puts you in a really interesting position, because all eyes are  focused on Michael, but there is this question: What if he does have an idol.  So on the one hand you could join Naviti and say, i'll do whatever you tell  me. On the other hand you might be the prey.  First of all, I’m jealous that no one has called me pretty tonight. I wish I was  getting some compliments, but I saw what happened to Libby last time they  tried the take a shot at him and they missed. So I feel like I’m in the same  position. My game hinges upon their read on Michael.  Jeff: Wendell, do you worry if you are wrong tonight it could bust your game  up?  Absolutely. If we shoot the wrong way and an innocent bystander gets hit,  kind of like a Libby, there are implications and there are things that will  happen down the line. So we're trying to shoot the best shot tonight.  Jeff: Kellyn, this is the kind of moment you dream of when you dream of  playing "Survivor." a huge question in the air. We have to be right,  or we're wrong. And right away dom is talking to Wendell. There is no  certainty.  Hopefully they're just singing the a, b, cs, because I thought everything was  golden.  Jeff: Does this make you nervous?  I was nervous already before. I’m still nervous. There is a one in four shot  of going home right now. One in four shot.  Jeff: So far you're not included in the Naviti conversation. Wow, Laurel. Now  how are you feeling?  This is what it's like to be Malolo person. This is what happens back at camp.  They powwow. I’m guessing they're going back and forth on whether or not  they're going to take the shot at Michael. I feel like they were saying they  were coming in taking the shot. They had to powwow. They probably changed  their mind. So right now I’m feeling like it's me.  Jeff: Kellyn, if "Survivor" is a roller coaster, where are we on  the ride?  How I feel is we're in the loop and I’m hanging upside down, very, very  uncomfortable, and until someone comes and pushes us for the rest of the  ride, I questions we're just waiting for this next vote.  Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Laurel, you're up. If anybody has a  hidden immunity idol and you want the play it, now would be the time to do  so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted  out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the  votes. First vote Kellyn. Wendell. Laurel. Michael. One vote Wendell, one  vote Laurel, one vote Michael, one vote Kellyn. Michael. That's two votes Michael,  one vote Wendell, one vote Laurel, one vote Kellyn. One vote left. Laurel. We're  tied. That's two votes Laurel, two votes Michael. We're going to have a  revote. Here's how it's going to work. Laurel and Michael, you will not vote.  Domenick, Wendell, Kellyn, you can only vote for one of those two. Domenick,  you're up. Come grab the urn.  There were six votes. I had an extra vote. Someone had an extra vote.  Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. I'll read the votes. Michael. One vote Michael.  12th person voted out and the fifth member of our jury. Michael. That's two. That's  enough.
