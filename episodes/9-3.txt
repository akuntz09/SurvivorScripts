<br/> <br/>Jeff Probst: Previously, on Survivor: There was a divide  in the Yasur tribe.  <br/>I definitely see groups forming. I think Lisa liked being  in the younger group and I think I gravitate more towards the older  group.  <br/>Probst: At Lopevi, John P. also worried about the division  between the young and the old.  <br/>You're so friggin' dangerous, man. You're too big of a  threat.  <br/>Right now, it's five against three. Those aren't good  odds.  <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge, the tribes played for a  hammock, blankets and some pillows. Once again, the balance beam proved to be  a challenge for the men and the women waltzed their way to victory. Yasur  wins their second challenge in a row. Back at Lopevi, the women's victory  dance upset Rory.  <br/>I don't think we would have intentionally shoved  somebody's nose into it. That was classless.  <br/>It was a game. I mean, we lost.  <br/>I understand it's a competition, but if she was a man,  would you have taken that, Sarge?  <br/>One person that's striking me as wrong as rain.  <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, Sarge lead Lopevi to  their first victory... Lopevi wins immunity! [ cheering] ...giving them flint  for fire. Before Tribal Council, Dolly couldn't commit to either group, so  she made deals to vote out both Eliza and Leann.  <br/>I've got myself in a cluster-you-know-what.  <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Twila pointed out the  differences in work ethic...  <br/>Leann, Scout and Ami, us four did a lot of work.  <br/>Probst: ...and Dolly's indecision cost her the game.  Forced to save herself, Eliza betrayed her group and voted with the older  women. Dolly, the tribe has spoken. 16 are left. Who will be voted out  tonight? [ theme song playing] Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT CBS  PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION NETWORK TELEVISION NETWORK TELEVISION [  rumbling] [ rumbling]  <br/>Dolly was totally blindsided at Tribal Council tonight.  She thought she was the one who was the swing vote and she would be the one  deciding who went home tonight, and, you know, that's not how the chips fell,  so...  <br/>How the hell did the vote switch to Dolly?  <br/>I think Mia and Julie and Lisa are a little upset with me  right now, but I did what I had to do to make sure I was staying in this  game. I thought she was writing my name down tonight. She sat there and  looked me in the eye and said, "I'm going to vote for a random  person." I... I couldn't get...  <br/>Hey, how about clueing us in, Eliza?  <br/>I know, but when was there time? It was like you guys  knew... like you were off in the woods.  <br/>We thought Eliza was strong with us, but I guess she  conspired with the other girls and decided to vote off Dolly without telling  us. So, yeah, we don't trust Eliza. So Lisa and Julie are the only girls I  trust right now and I guess we'll have to talk to Eliza tomorrow and see  where her head was at on this, but we're head was at on this, but we're all  very shocked right now. all very shocked right now.  <br/>We'll stack them. You guys, like, free wrap it and stack  it and free wrap it... and just keep crossing it so it kind of binds as you  go.  <br/>Uh-oh. Too short?  <br/>Too short.  <br/>Too short.  <br/>Hmm. Hey, where's Rory? Is he okay?  <br/>Look at this! Vitamin C! Vitamin C! Mm. Mm.  <br/>Hey, here comes Rory.  <br/>What's up?  <br/>When it comes to Rory, the thing that really gets under my  skin is he doesn't do a lot of, you know, physical work. He's not a team  player. He's an individualist. But in a team, you can't be your own man all  the time. It has to be about the team. Rory, I'm so used to supervising 40  people. I see what everybody's doing. I can't just sit here and do what Sarge  is doing.  <br/>Do you feel I'm not pulling my weight?  <br/>I saw you go on a lot of walks.  <br/>This is why I go on all my walks.  <br/>Yeah. You found that? That's cool.  <br/>Sarge wants to dictate when people take a crap, when  people take a bath. I'm a grown ass man and I don't take orders real well.  Sarge, if you don't feel that I'm pulling my weight, then you come to me and  say, "Rory, you need to do a little more."  <br/>All I said was, "What is he doing?" You know,  "people are really working hard and he's going on walks." I had to  hold back a lot of comments and stuff, you know, like...  <br/>And you think I haven't?  <br/>Rory has been very opinionated and he's been isolating  himself from the group. Sarge is key in decision-making for the five  guys.  <br/>I'm hoping he'll say, "Hey, maybe we should take J.P.  because we're having too much conflict with one of the much conflict with one  of the guys in the main alliance." guys in the main  alliance."  <br/>Looks like it's going to be a sunny day today. We need to  go on a serious food hunt. You want to go hunting for food today? Like, I  want to seriously go Like, I want to seriously go hunting for fruit. hunting  for fruit.  <br/>How are people complaining about people not doing work?  Somebody may be starting a fire, but who's getting firewood? Somebody might  be doing the shelter, but who's getting the palm fronds? So, I...  <br/>No, honey. Just listen.  <br/>Last night was ridiculous. &gt; Am I on your side or  what?  <br/>Now, wait a minute. We've all asked you all...  <br/>Twila, we've done a ton of work.  <br/>I'm not saying you didn't.  <br/>You start a fire in the morning. We could easily start  that fire in the morning if you were not here. You played it up last night,  and it's bull... It's the card that you're playing, and it's going to  backfire.  <br/>I'm not saying that you all didn't do any work. I said  some do more than others.  <br/>Because you play the martyr and you take on that role. You  take the martyr and you play on that role. If you were not here, we would  still have fire and shelter and food. That's it.  <br/>You stay here five minutes, then your asses go down there  in the ocean, so don't give me no bull, bitch, because I will whip your  butt.  <br/>It's your only card. Keep playing it. Bitch. Twila and I  were fighting about the fact that she threw us all under the bus last night,  the young'uns in the group, about being lazy. We've all pulled our weight  around here and I'm going to call her out as much as possible, because I  can't stand Twila-- I want her out.  <br/>No, you didn't say that. You're lying. If it's the damn  truth, it would be different, but you're damn lying!  <br/>Whatever, Twila. You play the martyr. I don't care. We all  do our ... around here.  <br/>I didn't say everybody...  <br/>Yes, you did. You called our asses out last night.  <br/>Mia's mad because she knows I was right. Get off your ass  and do something. Quit sitting on the beach and going swimming when everybody  else's working. Who was swimming down there...  <br/>Twila, because we were swimming for ten minutes? Who built  this shelter? Who got all the bamboo and the palm fronds?  <br/>You honestly haven't seen...  <br/>Don't think you're going to sit there and talk about me  and then today it's going to be nice and lovey-dovey and kissy, because you  want to be fake.  <br/>I'm not going to sit there and argue with her because  she's mad, but I ain't taking her crap, I'll tell you that. I'll whip the  little scrawny bitch's ass because I don't care. I ain't in it here to make  no I ain't in it here to make no friends. friends.  <br/>So, what's up with you now? Because everyone thinks you're  sketchy.  <br/>I feel like I am sketchy, but I didn't ever make an  alliance with them. I just said, "This time, we've got to get rid of  Dolly."  <br/>Okay, so there isn't like a permanent thing going  on?  <br/>No, no, no. Julie and I went to get tree mail and Julie  was like, "Eliza, are you still with us?" And I was like, "I  did what I needed to do because, you know, I didn't trust Dolly and I thought  that she was going to vote for me."  <br/>Tree mail!  <br/>Oh, hey, you two. Just the people we want to see.  <br/>Mia and Lisa walk up to meet Julie and I, who are coming  back from getting tree mail. I'm with you 100%.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>I was like, "I'm with you guys 100%."  <br/>Let's get rid of Twila. I can't stand that bitch anymore.  I'm about to bust ass. Dude, Eliza, don't switch.  <br/>Please. Please.  <br/>As long as the four of us are still strong, we'll pull  somebody else in.  <br/>Well, I'm not so sure that Eliza is in with us. Even then,  I don't know if I trust her. But I've got a backup plan, so we'll see what  happens.  <br/>Okay, ready? "This next challenge is a tough one.  Both tribes should feel quite stressed. The island's aura darkens. Today, all  friendships will be put to the test. A long day and night for everyone. Yes,  there is need to worry."  <br/>Oh, no!  <br/>"With immunity on the line, you better finish in a  hurry."  <br/>Immunity! Oh, my God!  <br/>Immunity, again? Back-to-back ones?  <br/>We went to Tribal Council last night and we have tree mail  talking about immunity. And that bites because yesterday sucked big time and  I don't want to go through it again two days to go through it again two days  in a row. in a row.  <br/>Probst: What's up, guys? You look good.  <br/>Feel good, Jeff.  <br/>Probst: Yasur, come on in! Guys, get your first look at  the new Yasur tribe, minus one member.  <br/>Who's gone, then?  <br/>Probst: Dolly, voted out at the last Tribal Council.  <br/>Dolly?  <br/>Dolly, the blonde.  <br/>Oh, Barbie's gone.  <br/>Probst: All right, first things first. Chad, take back  immunity. Immunity back up for grabs. Today, you are playing for both reward  and immunity. [ applause] Here's the twist: both tribes will vote out one  member tonight. Separate Tribal Councils, two people going home.  <br/>No!  <br/>Probst: You'll first compete tribe versus tribe for  reward. The winning tribe will then move on and take part in an individual  immunity challenge where one person will win immunity. They will be safe from  the vote. The losing tribe, they will go to a separate Tribal Council. They  will vote out one member. To be clear: two people going home by the end of  the day. Okay, let me explain the reward challenge. You'll make your way  through three caged walls. First wall, you're going to untie a series of  planks, get yourself through a gate. For the second wall, you'll use  grappling hooks, toss them out, retrieve three rings with keys from the sand.  Then open three locks, release that gate, climb through. For the third wall,  you'll untie a series of interlocking poles until you can slide up the center  section, climb through. First tribe to get all eight members on their finish mat  wins reward and a shot at individual immunity. Big enough stakes?  <br/>Roger.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Want to know what the reward is?  <br/>Yeah! [ applause]  <br/>Probst: Fishing kit, Hawaiian sling, mask, line,  hooks...  <br/>That's what we want.  <br/>Probst: ... and sinkers. And today, what you covet:  Individual immunity for the winner of the second phase of the challenge.  Anything not clear? Take your spots. Wait for my go. Here we go, for reward  and a shot at individual immunity. Survivors, ready? Survivors, ready? Go!  Go!  <br/>Okay, this knot is important.  <br/>I got one off on the bottom.  <br/>Bottom board's loose from the outside, guys.  <br/>Probst: Two different strategies.  <br/>Don't forget about the inside ropes.  <br/>Probst: Lopevi really spread out; they have a plan. Yasur  all grouped together. They have a plan.  <br/>I got this one.  <br/>The lower ones, guys. Lower.  <br/>Yes, I got this one.  <br/>Work with me on the outside, guys.  <br/>Probst: Guys are on their final knot.  <br/>Start doing it. One will do. One will do.  <br/>Right there.  <br/>Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!  <br/>Probst: Lopevi's through to the second wall. Let's go,  Yasur. You're moving slow.  <br/>Watch out. Watch out for this one.  <br/>Probst: Bubba and J.P. with the hooks, looking for three  keys.  <br/>Go, go, go, go!  <br/>There you go! There you go!  <br/>Yeah, baby!  <br/>Probst: Easy, easy, easy.  <br/>You can't jerk it.  <br/>Probst: Bubba had one and he lost it.  <br/>What about this one? We can go?  <br/>Probst: Yasur getting through.  <br/>Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!  <br/>Probst: You're in this, guys. Let's go!  <br/>Now really chuck it.  <br/>Right there.  <br/>Probst: J. P.'s got a ring hooked.  <br/>Swing it over. Over.  <br/>Try again. Try again, honey.  <br/>Probst: Scout with a short toss; that's not going to  work.  <br/>Just a little bit faster. Pull it straight. I got  it.  <br/>There it is. There's one! There's one!  <br/>Probst: J.P. has his first key for Lopevi.  <br/>There you go, all right! Pull from here.  <br/>Probst: Yasur's hooked a ring.  <br/>Good job, Twila.  <br/>Probst: Twila pulling that ring in. She's got it hooked.  Yasur has their first key.  <br/>Aim past it, dude. He's got it. He's got it.  <br/>Probst: J. P.'s got another one.  <br/>Take your time, J.P. Take your time, buddy.  <br/>Get ready, get ready, get ready. Get ready. All  right!  <br/>Probst: Lopevi with their second key. One more to  go.  <br/>Aw!  <br/>Probst: Lopevi's lost one of their grappling hooks. Yasur  going for their second key.  <br/>You're on fire, Scout.  <br/>Probst: Scout, you going to throw that thing or dance with  it?  <br/>Come on, guys, faster. Let's throw it.  <br/>I got one.  <br/>I got it.  <br/>Wait! Go slow, because we could get a key.  <br/>Come on, quick, quick!  <br/>Probst: Leann and Twila working together. They've got another  one. Yasur's tied it up.  <br/>Okay, okay, okay.  <br/>Probst: Lopevi trying to get their grappling hook back,  pulling it in.  <br/>Scout, come on!  <br/>Damn it!  <br/>Probst: Another short toss by Scout.  <br/>I got it!  <br/>You got it, got it, got it. Bring it, bring it, bring  it.  <br/>Got it, got it. Here, here, here.  <br/>Probst: Lopevi has their last key. Yasur still needs one  more.  <br/>Go for another one. Go for another one.  <br/>Got it, got it!  <br/>Got it. Let's go. Go, go, go.  <br/>Probst: Lopevi's got all the locks they need and they are  through.  <br/>Go, go, go, go, go, go.  <br/>Probst: Moving on to the last gate. Let's go, Yasur.  <br/>Nice!  <br/>Probst: Twila pulling in Yasur's last key.  <br/>Here, key! Right here, right here. Right here.  <br/>Come on, guys.  <br/>Pull that one out.  <br/>Probst: Sarge removing a pole.  <br/>Pull it out!  <br/>Probst: John removing a pole.  <br/>Oh, we're good.  <br/>Don't! Get off! What are you doing? Go through!  <br/>Probst: Sarge barking out orders.  <br/>Don't step on that!  <br/>Probst: Brady throwing tribe members through.  <br/>Guys, I got it, I got it!  <br/>Right over here, Twila! Twila!  <br/>Probst: And here comes Sarge bringing up the  caboose.  <br/>Lopevi!  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: Lopevi wins reward and a shot at individual  immunity!  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: Yasur, take a seat on the mat. You'll be sitting  this next challenge out. All right, Lopevi, congratulations.  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: You now have a Hawaiian sling, fishing gear and a  mask. You're also going to take part in an individual immunity challenge.  Here's how it works. Buried in each of these lanes are seven ladder rungs.  Your job: to dig up the rungs, put your ladder together. Keep in mind, each  rung is unique and will not fit in every slot. First person to put their  ladder together correctly and get to the top wins immunity. Make sense?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Take a spot. Wait for my go. Here we go, guys. At  stake: individual immunity, ensuring your safety at tonight's Tribal Council.  Survivors, ready? Go! Brady trying to figure out how deep they are. Sarge has  his first piece. So does Chad. John, there's his first. Brady on the board.  Bubba, I don't know what he's looking for. [ laughter] Chad has two. Rory  putting his feet to work digging. John with another piece. [ cheers] Bubba  finally on the board. [ laughter] Chad digging into that sand, finds another  one. John with five. Chad with six, looking for seven. Chris with another  piece, up to five. Only two shy. Chad has his seventh piece. He's got to  start putting his puzzle together. John has his seventh piece. Going to start  putting his ladder together. Remember, guys, this is a puzzle. Each rung only  fits one way into the ladder. Chad's got another piece. John with another  piece. Chad with five. J.P. with his seventh piece. He's putting his ladder  together. Chad trying to find out which piece is not right. John working on  his last piece. He's got it. John wins immunity!  <br/>Good job, John.  <br/>Probst: Came from behind. Nice job. Congratulations.  You're safe at tonight's Tribal Council. There's one other thing. Come on  down.  <br/>One other thing.  <br/>Probst: John, you're now going to leave and go back to  camp with Yasur. Join them. [ laughter and applause]  <br/>Whoo!  <br/>Welcome.  <br/>Probst: Now, before you get too excited, it's not forever.  You're going to go back to Camp Yasur. You'll be gathering information for a  very big decision, because tonight you will return to Tribal Council where  you will meet Lopevi. You guys will have your own Tribal Council. You'll be  safe. One of these guys is going home. When your tribal is over, you will  stay behind. Yasur comes in. You will give your immunity to one member from  Yasur. You're not to discuss who you are giving your immunity to. You'll keep  that a secret until we get to Tribal Council.  <br/>All right.  <br/>All right.  <br/>Probst: Head on out, guys.  <br/>Probst: Head on out, guys.  <br/>Because I won the immunity challenge, I can't get voted  off tonight. But, strangely, there was a little twist and I got a chance to  meet the women, see their camp, and then pick one that can have the necklace  for their Tribal Council. So, who knows what's going to happen tonight with  both tribes voting people off? It could really change the dynamics of both  groups, big time. Everyone that voted for Dolly, raise your hand. All right.  You guys, this way.  <br/>When we hit the beach, John immediately made a stand. It's  like, "Girls who voted for Dolly over here and girls who voted for Leann  over here," which made no sense. What does it matter? I thought it was  completely ridiculous.  <br/>All right, guys.  <br/>All right, guys. Check it out. Check it out.  <br/>All right, these four guys were planning on voting me out  last night.  <br/>Take that back.  <br/>Wait a minute, wait a minute.  <br/>Okay, okay, okay. I didn't want John thinking that this  was some five-person alliance, because that's definitely not what it was. I  felt like I needed to explain to him that it was because my head was on the  chopping block. I go, "Dolly, look me in the eye and tell me you're not  writing my name down." She's like, "I don't know. I don't want to  vote with either side. I'm just going to vote for someone random." And I  go, "Oh, she's voting against me." And then, it was like...  <br/>She was trying to play both sides.  <br/>Yeah, she was.  <br/>It was a few...  <br/>JOHN: And she got caught.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>It was a few hours before Tribal Council and Dolly  goes...  <br/>That's all I need to know, yeah.  <br/>I'm just going to go talk to them.  <br/>She went up there and she goes...  <br/>I'm just going to go talk to them.  <br/>There's no way he's giving her immunity, you know?  <br/>He's not going to give any of them immunity.  <br/>Unless he wants to...  <br/>Good, Eliza, keep talking. Dig yourself in a hole, Eliza.  Stupid.  <br/>Yeah, and she won't let anybody else talk.  <br/>I know, please.  <br/>Yesterday, after we lost the immunity challenge, if you  would have looked at me, I was crying. It was so sad. Like, we all get along  so well. Like, really, it's been amazing.  <br/>Mm-hmm. Eliza just didn't stop talking. She just kept  talking and talking and talking. I mean, she seems really sweet. I'm sure  she's really nice, but the bottom line is, "Oh, my God, would you please  stop talking?" Hi, I'm John.  <br/>Mia.  <br/>JOHN: Nice to meet you.  <br/>I'm Lisa.  <br/>Julie.  <br/>JOHN: Nice to meet you. All right, here's my question:  flat out, who do you guys think you need to get off?  <br/>Just don't give it to Twila, please.  <br/>JOHN: No, I won't give it to Twila.  <br/>Please.  <br/>Or Eliza.  <br/>JOHN: The girls told me not to give the immunity necklace  to Eliza and Twila, but I could care less who gets voted off of this tribe. I  just want them to not be mad at me for whoever gets voted off, because I  might merge with them and it would be nice to have them on my side later  on.  <br/>Here she comes. She's going to work us now.  <br/>Oh, no, tell her to go away. Whoa, this is our time.  <br/>Have you guys found any grubs?  <br/>No.  <br/>So, what's up with you?  <br/>Yeah, dude, what's up? Teetering?  <br/>I am not teetering.  <br/>You're notvoting for me tonight.  <br/>No way in hell. Scout is a detriment in challenges.  <br/>I don't want to vote for Scout.  <br/>She thinks we can't...  <br/>I don't want to vote for Scout.  <br/>I do.  <br/>I don't.  <br/>I do. If it goes five-three?  <br/>I would rather vote for Twila than Scout.  <br/>Then it would be a tie for me.  <br/>I don't know what's going on with them, I just know they  are not too happy with each other. To see some conflict like that, it's going  to fun to pick a girl to not get voted off.  <br/>You just keep saying you don't want there to be a tie,  well...  <br/>I know... Honestly, I don't trust you, Eliza.  <br/>Shh, let's not do this right now.  <br/>Fine, don't trust me. Fine, fine, because I'm going to be  the first one out anyhow. You've been mad at me since I voted for Dolly and I  understand why, but, like...  <br/>I'm over it.  <br/>Me, too.  <br/>I just want to know what's up tonight.  <br/>Eliza, if we can get rid of one of them tonight, it's us  four strong again, and they're out. Eliza seems to be teetering a little bit,  but tonight at Tribal Council I'm almost positive it's going to be a tie. I  mean, me and Twila had one of our famous fights this morning, so I think that  me and Julie and Lisa and Eliza are going to be voting for Twila, and I'm  pretty sure that Leann and Ami and Twila and Scout will be voting for me  tonight. But, there's still individual immunity to be given out, too, so I  don't know what's going to so I don't know what's going to happen. happen.  <br/>Man, we kicked ass on those rings, didn't we? Man, oh,  man. We won the reward challenge. It was a great feeling. And then, after  that, we ran into the immunity challenge. Out of most of the other guys, I  needed it the most, so I think that I'm going to be quite vulnerable tonight.  I would actually like to use the term "dead man walking." Brady's  in the same boat. We're the youngest guys there. We're the strongest there.  And right now, it's five against And right now, it's five against three. three.  We've got to plant the seed in Sarge's head, saying, "Sarge, ally with  us or think about getting rid of Rory," because the Sarge and Rory are  the last few days have been having some conflict. What about this idea of  after the merge? You need the group of guys that you think, if they hang  together, will be the last people in the game.  <br/>Right.  <br/>If one of the four of us can win most of the challenges,  we just look out for each other and we make sure we're the last four.  <br/>It's possible. It's possible.  <br/>It's simple. It's not underhanded. And we know our four  votes are And we know our four votes are going in one direction. going in one  direction.  <br/>I don't know. I got a real bad feeling about one of our  pact, man. He's just got a sorry attitude.  <br/>You don't have to worry about no one in our pact, I  guarantee you that.  <br/>No, I ain't... I'm not worried about that. I have trouble  working next to him and being around him right now.  <br/>Rory?  <br/>Yeah! I'm like... I mean...  <br/>Dude, I understand what you're saying, and we'll deal with  it, but this just deal with it, but this just isn't the time. isn't the  time.  <br/>I hate Tribal Council. I hate building a team of men or  survivors, building them up to a fine-tuned team and then tearing them down.  That's not me. But I'm playing this game, and during this game I have to do  during this game I have to do that. that.  <br/>Probst: Bring in John. He spent the afternoon over at the  Yasur camp. I'm sure you had an interesting afternoon.  <br/>Yes, I did.  <br/>Probst: We'll get to that in a minute. First, though, I  want to talk about the tribe. Chad, how have you seen this tribe change and  grow?  <br/>We've had camaraderie since the very get-go, and I think  that we've gained a lot of confidence by winning some of the challenges, and  that's brought us closer together.  <br/>Probst: Brady, any first impressions here that have  changed?  <br/>I don't know if it's better or worse, but I certainly had  a different impression of Sarge. Sarge is kind of a loud, booming personality,  but Sarge is a much more personable guy than most people would probably give  him credit for and that most people see.  <br/>Probst: So, John, while these guys are back at camp,  you're over with the women. How aggressive were the women in terms of working  you for that thing around your neck, immunity?  <br/>You know what, as soon as I went in there, I said,  "people who voted for Dolly," I said, "go over there. People  who didn't vote for Dolly, go over there." And as soon as I divided  them, I figured out what their alliances were, and it was really easy after I  divided them.  <br/>Good job.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Probst: Who knew young John was this bright?  <br/>Good job!  <br/>Probst: So you feel very confident in the decision you're  making?  <br/>I feel 150% confident.  <br/>Probst: Now, let's get to this vote. J. P, what are you  basing your vote on?  <br/>I think you want this group as strong as possible going  into that next challenge. Who are those individuals that have the particular  strengths, the skill-sets, the mesh, the personality that can move forward  and prepare for that merge?  <br/>Probst: Sarge, tough vote for you, or is this easy because  friendship isn't part of this game?  <br/>Friendships... I have friendships here, but I'm here to  play a game. The person going home tonight is a casualty of war.  <br/>Probst: Okay, it's time to vote. John, you're wearing the  immunity necklace. You're the only person safe. Everybody else is fair game.  Everybody else is fair game. John, you're up first. John, you're up  first.  <br/>I'm voting for you. I might be weaker than you physically,  but I'm stronger than you mentally. than you mentally. It's just a game. It's  just a game.  <br/>Ain't nothing personal, man.  <br/>Ain't nothing personal, man. I'm just being consistent.  I'm just being consistent.  <br/>I'm voting for Rory tonight because you are the weakest  guy in the tribe. Hopefully, there will be four votes to get you out. votes  to get you out. Or tie with me. Or tie with me.  <br/>This is our strategy.  <br/>This is our strategy. Sorry, my friend. Sorry, my  friend.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are  read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the  Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Rory. J. P.  J. P. That's two votes J.P. Rory. Two votes Rory; two votes J.P. Rory. Three  votes Rory; two votes J.P. Tied. Three votes J P. Three votes Rory. Four  votes J.P. Three votes Rory. Last vote. Third person voted out of Survivor:  Vanuatu, J.P. Survivor: Vanuatu, J.P. Please bring me your torch. Please  bring me your torch. J. P., the tribe has spoken. J. P., the tribe has  spoken. It's time for you to go. It's time for you to go. Well, both times,  you guys have been to Tribal Council, the consensus has been that the vote  was based on keeping the tribe strong. You voted out two of your strongest  members. Interesting strategy. See if it works. John, you'll stay behind for  the next Tribal Council. The rest of you guys take your torches with you back  to camp. torches with you back to camp. Good night. Good night.  <br/>Well, what can I say? I survived seven days. I was hoping  to stay a little bit longer, but there's no way that I think I was outwitted,  outlasted, outplayed. Coming to the island and being part of something that I  couldn't even imagine, I'll tell couldn't even imagine, I'll tell you, what  an experience. you, what an experience.  <br/>Probst: Welcome back to Tribal Council. Lopevi has already  voted somebody out. John is staying behind because, as you know, he's going  to award one of you his immunity necklace which will make you safe from the  vote tonight. You know who you're going to give it to? give it to?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: So, Yasur, one of you is about to become immune  from the vote. the vote. John, give it up. John, give it up. Why Ami?  <br/>Because, out of everyone there, she was not getting voted  off tonight no matter what-- and I think you guys need to figure out who you  want to vote out. And because I picked her, it's probably going to be who it  was going to be anyway, and you'll figure out a lot about your own tribe,  because you guys are two sides. Grab your torch...  <br/>Take it easy, guys.  <br/>Probst: ... find the rest of your tribe.  <br/>Bye, John.  <br/>Bye, John.  <br/>Probst: Good night. Ami, surprised?  <br/>A little surprised, yeah. I thought that he would put it  on someone's head that he thought might get voted out tonight.  <br/>Probst: Scout, you leave here after a very surprising vote  to a lot of people. You go back to camp. It's a tough night. You get up in  the morning, and what happens?  <br/>It was obvious that Mia was a little pissed off at the  vote, didn't understand it. This morning, when they got up, Twila and Mia  really got into it.  <br/>Probst: Mia, what's your take?  <br/>It had nothing really to do about the vote. It just had to  do about Twila's comments about the young ones not doing anything, not  pulling their weight. And it really did upset me, so I confronted her about  it this morning.  <br/>Probst: Twila, did you make a comment about  workload?  <br/>She was offended by what I said last night at Tribal  Council. I don't know why I offended her so bad, but I just said what I felt.  I felt like I was telling the truth.  <br/>Probst: Julie, what's the result of that?  <br/>I think it goes a little deeper than the comment. Speaking  for myself, I haven't felt like Twila's made any effort to communicate or  build anything with me, so, you know, without that bridge, it's frustrating,  and I think Mia got frustrated.  <br/>They haven't given me an opportunity to talk to them. I  mean, why would I want to walk up to somebody that rolls their eyes at me all  the time and acts like they can't stand to be around me? Why would I even  want to try?  <br/>Twila, you talk to me in one-word answers. I'm not going  to try to pull a conversation out of you.  <br/>That's just my personality, and that's just how I  am.  <br/>You have plenty of conversations with everybody else  except for a couple of us.  <br/>I just communicate better with men than I do women. I  always have, always will. I am the tomboy. I do weld. I do fix trucks. I do  those things. And it's hard for me to bring up conversation with these women  that I feel I have nothing in common with. You know, until you walk in  somebody else's shoes, don't judge.  <br/>Have you taken the time to walk in these girls' shoes and  realize they're just girls? They like to play on the beach. They like to do  girly stuff. Like, have you taken that time?  <br/>No, I haven't. I'll be honest with you. I haven't.  <br/>Do you realize that right now is your opportunity to,  like, find the feminine side of you and just let go of "this is what I  am" and realize there's so much more to you than just that? There is a  wonderful, feminine...  <br/>Maybe I don't have a feminine side to me, I don't  know.  <br/>Yes, you do. Just say, "you know what? Will you guys  French-braid my hair tomorrow? Will one of you French..." you know?  Something silly like that. I know, it sounds crazy. Give it a go. It feels  nice to have someone else French-braid your hair.  <br/>I can try that. We can start with the hair. That'd be  working. Even do my nails, too, while you're at it, would you? Yeah, that'd  be great. That'd be great.  <br/>Probst: Scout, what are you basing your vote on  tonight?  <br/>Maintaining a healthy, emotional attitude in camp.  <br/>Probst: Your vote tonight is to get rid of somebody that  you think is causing disharmony, chaos, problems.  <br/>Yeah, chaos, agitation, disharmony, yeah.  <br/>Probst: Mia, you're shaking your head, rolling your eyes,  closing your eyes. You're like the little doggie in the window.  <br/>I feel like Scout's statement is definitely pointed toward  me and the disharmony was our fight today. And I think it was on both sides,  so I don't see where I'm causing emotional distress in the tribe at  all.  <br/>Probst: Eliza, decided who you're voting for?  <br/>I think Scout's statement about disharmony is a good one,  but if I had the choice to keep everyone here I definitely would.  <br/>Probst: With that, it is time to vote. Ami is the only  person you cannot vote for. Everybody else is fair game. Everybody else is  fair game. Mia, you're up. Mia, you're up.  <br/>Twila, I'm voting for you. You said you can't relate to  women, and, unfortunately, you got stuck on an all women's tribe. I don't  want to spend another I don't want to spend another day on the island with  you. day on the island with you.  <br/>Mia, your volcano erupts more than I like. Good luck in  finding a husband Good luck in finding a husband that will put up with you. that  will put up with you.  <br/>I think you're a young woman that's got a big chip on her  shoulder. I think that you got a mouth- and-a-half and I think you need to  go. to go. That's all. That's all.  <br/>Twila, my vote's for you. I think you have an amazing work  ethic, but you can't be here anymore. Sorry.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are  read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the  Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Twila. Mia.

Bring me your torch.  Mia, the tribe has spoken.  <br/>Thanks. Kick ass, ladies. Kick ass, ladies.  <br/>Bye, Mia.  <br/>Bye, Mia.  <br/>Probst: Well, if there was one clear theme from tonight's  Tribal Council, it was that the seven of you desire to be a strong group of  women with emotional harmony. The question is: did tonight's vote bring you  any closer? Ami, you can leave that necklace behind. Grab your torches. Head  back to camp.

Um, Twila, you have  been extremely deceiving with all the girls. I thought you were absolutely  horrendous to me, and I think that you did not have the social skills to play  this game at all, and that's going to wear on the girls, um, and hopefully  you'll girls, um, and hopefully you'll get voted off next.
