<br/>Jeff: Hello, Survivor fans! We are live backstage at cbs in los angeles for  the two-hour, season finale of "Survivor:game changers. Here they are,  the game cherngz. You knew it was going to be bleed when Malcolm went out  early, Sandra was dethroned. Even this nut, Tony, couldn't get any traction.  This season had some of the most enterTaining and risky game play ever, and  the good news, it's not over. More history will happen tonight. All right,  here's what's going on. We have a two-hour season finale. We're going to read  the votes. We'll announce the winner. Then we bring everybody on stage for  the live reunion show, and there is a lot to cover, including one of the most  talked about moments in the history of "Survivor," when Zeke was  outed as being transgender. If you have questions or comments for the group  it's not to late upon you can hit me up @Jeffprobst. To late upon you can hit  me up @Jeffprobst. We have a packed house here on cbs. [ cheers and applause  ] they are ready. I’m know you are. Here's the deal-- six people lowest. Tai  has patiently held on to two idols. Troyzan has an idol. Sarah has the legacy  advantage. It's a lot of game-changing power still left in the game. And once  again, we go into a finale still very uncerTain who will take home the title  of Survivor and the million dollars. Here it is, the season finale of "Survivor"!   Jeff: For the first time ever, we brought 20 of "Survivor's"  biggest game changers to fiji to battle against each other.  You gotta go big or go home.  Woooo!  Jeff: The game play started early.  They're going to be looking for spy shacks. They ain't going to be looking  for an underground bunker. As they revolutionizinged "Survivor"  again. With bold moves. Wild game play--  i was loyal to you completely and you crushed my heart! It's frustrating, and  i'm pissed!  Jeff: And unforgettable tribal councils.  What the hell is going on here, Jeff?  Jeff: Oh, my gosh! Where risky idol plays--  i'm going to give the idol to pretty lady.  I'm gog vomit.  Jeff: Epic face-offs... J.T.  Damn.  <br/>Jeff: And raw emotion.  I didn't want to be, like, the tran "Survivor" player. I’m want to  be Zeke the "Survivor" player.  Are you.  I feel like I’m am.  You are.  Jeff: All leading to a slew of devastating blindsides. The tribe has spoken.  And at the last tribal council.  There is a rat in this group, so I’m am going to steal Sarah's vote.  Well, actually, that's my advantage. It's nontransferable. It says it on the  bottom.  Jeff: Cirie, Sarah is the only person who can use that advantage. A foiled attempt  by Cirie to flip the game upside down resulted in more chaos.  You know what, Jeff? I’m am going to use my advantage.  Jeff: Whose vote are you going to steal?  I'm going to take Tai's.  Jeff: And Michaela was sent to the jury. Michaela, the tribe has spoken.  Leaving everyone scrambling for a seat in the final three. Now, only six  remain. Sarah, since the merge, she has played an aggressive game, bouncing  from one alliance to another taking out anyone standing in her way.  You're my, like, "it" girl out here.  Jeff: Sierra.  I will be giving it to Sarah.  It worked.  Jeff: With the legacy advantage guaranteeing her a spot in the final five,  she is in a power position to shift the game again.  I deserve to be a game changer. I’m didn't leave my son for 39 days to not  win $1 million.  Jeff: Troyzan, for weeks, he has quietly played from the bottom.  Oh, my God!  Good job, guyes.  Jeff: But with a hidden immunity idol instill his pocket, and alliances in  turmoil, the timing may be right for Troyzan to make a move.  When everything is not looking your way, there is something always in you, Troyzan,  that is going to click and say, "never give up. You can make it through  anything."  Jeff: Tai, his uncanny ability to find hidden immunity idols--  holy cow! "Survivor" Gods really looked at me.  Jeff: ...and his patience to not play them leaves Tai in a powerful position  with two idols and only three tribal councils remaining.  I'm not afraid to make big moves. You want to make big moves, you have to  take the bull and own it.  Jeff: Culpepper. His social game was dominant early.  You've got to think about what's best for your game. Are you in it for him or  you?  Jeff: But since merge, he has been on the wrong side of the numbers.  Everybody's on board to vote culpepper.  Yeah.  I have to win immunity for me to be able to make it another day.  Jeff: With no immunity idols or advantages, winning challenges may be of the  only way culpepper can make it to the final tribal council.  Playing "Survivor," your guard is always up. And if you relax, if  you nap on the job, you're going home.  Jeff: Aubry-- it's been another season of highs and lows for this strategic  force. Aubry has it!  It really felt great at the immunity challenge winning. But had a good  relationship with Andrea, so, naturally, she's killed off too,.  Jeff: But she is once again within striking distance of the end. Can Aubry  find her way back to the final three or will she be voted out for the first  time in her "Survivor" career.  I'm in deep doo-doo, but that's the Aubry way-- always hanging on by the skin  of my teeth.  Jeff: Cirie, this "Survivor" legend and perennial fan favorite has  once again relied on social relationships and savvy game play.  Tai sees Sarah as a threat.  I need to get Tai comfortable enough to trust me.  I can believe you?  When you see me stand up and play that advantage, you still can't believe me?   Okay.  Jeff: In her four seasons, Cirie has never found an idol or won an individual  immunity challenge.  You got it, Cirie.  Jeff: But with the million dollars once again in sight, is this when it  finally all comes together?  To stay in this game at this point, you have to see everything. And if you  skip over the picture that's right in front of you because you're looking  down the road, it will get your torch extinguished. Trust me. I’m know.  Jeff: With six game-changing players, three idols, and the legacy advantage  still in play, the stage is set for a wild and historic finish. Who will have  what it takes to outwit, outplay, and outlast all the rest to win the million  dollars and the title of "sole Survivor." captioning funded by cbs  and ford. We go further, so you can.  All right, I’m want to know who the rat was.  I want to know what did Michaela do?  Nothing.  So it was just random--  i felt betrayed by Cirie at tribal council playing my "steal a  vote." so I’m targeted Michaela because Michaela is Cirie's right-hand  man. But now, I’m don't know who I’m can trust. Fortunately, I’m still have  the legacy advantage, which can be played at six. So I’m know i'm safe. That  was my advantage to use, not yours. Why would you take my vote?  Because Tai said, "Sarah, she's the biggest threat." if somebody  says your name, you need to go--  Cirie, you need to talk to me about this. If we're going to be in an alliance  together. I’m wanted to use that at another time and now I’m can't because of  you.  This is true, this is true. I'm in a lot of trouble right now. Sarah is  really pissed and thinks i'm trying to pull an okey-doke on her. It felt  like, "whoa. I'm trying to do you a favor." but as the saying goes,  "no good deed goes unpunished." hopefully there's something to be  saved, salvaged. I’m don't know.  I want to know who the rat was supposed to be exposed?  Honestly?  Yeah.  I felt that Tai was playing you, me, and them.  Nope.  Aubry, you know. You've been a part of those conversations. Tai said this we  should get Sarah out. So I’m told him about the advantage. Now, I’m didn't  tell you about my advantage?  I just found that out.  Just found it out when? Observer we went to tribal.  Tonight.  Did you tonight, before we left.  No.  Oh, my God!  Tai, are the one that threw my name out there? Just answer that honestly to  me. Was it you?  I did say that. I’m just said theoretically who is the biggest threat?  You were going to vote me out tonight.  Yes because she told me--  i apologize.  I've been trying to tell you this--  i approximation.  I don't need to hear anymore right now. You're going to [bleep] vote me out  tonight! I’m put my ass on the line for you, and I’m would have gone home  tonight because you stabbed me in the back. So I’m don't need to hear  anymore.  She set me up--  no, Tai.  With you.  Then why would you vote me out?  I don't know. I’m panicked. Last time I’m played I’m didn't do any lying,  didn't do anything. And this time I’m said this is "game changer."  I’m want to play a little bit. I’m felt like I’m was doing what everybody  else was doing anyway but I’m got caught. Now I’m am "Tai the  liar." I’m think I’m screwed up my game. Now my options are limited.  Luckily, I’m still have two idols that nobody knows about. Maybe I’m can use  them to gain trust? I’m need to have someone to lean on.  I found one here.  And found one... I’m was going to tell you and Sarah at the same time.  Don't tell Sarah.  I'm not, i'm not. She's so pissed off. I'm not. I'm with you now.  Okay, okay.  I'll play it today, play it tomorrow without telling you, but I’m feel I’m owe  you that. Tell me what you want me to do with it.  Just hold on to it for right now. Tai's whole game has imploded. He got  caught in a web of lies. He felt so bad this morning he wanted to make amendz  with me and told me he had two idols. Now, do I’m really believe him? I’m don't  know. I’m haven't trusted Tai since he voted out Sierra. I’m can help him get  further in the game, but I’m have to have collateral. You want to keep  playing i'm your key.  Yes.  Don't fall into any trap.  I'm not.  We'll keep it locked. I’m manipulated him on the first one, and i'm going to  manipulate him on these two as well. Ies lied to me numerous times. I’m have  no problem throwing him under the expwus voting him out with his own idol.  Jeff: Come on in, guys!  Jeff: Day 36, six people left. Shall we get to today' today's I’m challenge?  Yes.  Jeff: First things first, culpepper, take it back. Thank you. Once again,  immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to race  through a giant maze, collecting three bags of puzzle pieces along the way.  Once you have all your bags, you'll use the pieces inside to solve a compass  rose puzzles. First to finish wins immunity, safe from the vote. Losers,  tribal council, where somebody will be the 15th person voted out of this game  and become the eighth member of our jury. In addition, you're playing for  reward.  Wow.  Oh!  Jeff: The winner will have delivered to them at camp chicken parm.  Oh, man!  Jeff: Spa get wemeat sauce. Garlic bread, and key lime pie.  Damn.  Jeff: For dessert.  A little florida.  Jeff: Ready to play? We'll draw spots and get it on. Here we go, for  immunity, guaranteed spot in the final five, and a nice reward. Survivors ready?  Go! There are two sides to this maze. Troyzan, Aubry, and Sierra are working  one side. Culpepper, Tai, and Sarah working the other. You have three bags  total that you have to collect from your side. That's it. Once you have all  three bags, you start working on that puzzle. Troyzan at his first station,  culpepper heading to his first station. Tai right on his Tail. Troyzan has  his first bag. He's heading back. Culpepper coming back with his first bag.  Culpepper takes a big fall! Tai right behind him. Tai father down now! Troyzan  is back with his first bag. Culpepper coming back with his first bag. Tai  right behind him, literally just following the path that culpepper is legend.  Culpepper drops his first, heads back out. Tai heading back out for his second  bag. Aubry has her first bag. Cirie now has her first bag. Sarah has her  first bag. She's heading back. After 36 days, who wants it more? Cirie right  on Aubry's Tail now. Sarah has her first. She's looking for her second. Troyzan  is in the lead. He has that second bag. Culpepper at the second station. And  once again, Tai is just trying to follow culpepper. Aubry untying that second  bag. She's heading back now. Troyzan drops his second bag. But he dropped it  at the wrong puzzle.  I'm color blind.  I'll take it!  Jeff: Culpepper back with his second bag. He has distanced himself from Tai.  It is Aubry, Troyzan, culpepper, and Tai all looking for their third and  final bag as Sarah and Cirie head back with their second. Sarah looking lost  in that maze. Aubry trying to get to that third station. And she's done it! Aubry  has her third bag. She starts untying. Aubry has her third bag. She's heading  back. Culpepper's now racing back with his third bag. Sarah back out now.  Culpepper will be back first. He can start working on that puzzle. Aubry  right behind culpepper. Here comes Cirie. It is culpepper, Cirie, octoberry,  and Troyzan with the early lead working on their puzzles. Huge stakes,  guaranteed cerTainty tonight at tribal. There are 41 pieces in this puzzle. All  you have to do is figure out where they go. Tai back with his third bag. Sarah  coming back with her third bag. 36 days in. You want to get to 37, you will  most definitely earn it. A lot of these pieces require another piece or two.  You have to figure out where they go, remember, and then find the supporting  piece that goes with it. Right now it is culpepper and Aubry with the most  pieces placed. Sarah's got a couple of pieces in there. Slow going for Tai  right now. Both Cirie and Troyzan taking a different approach, studying their  pieces first. Sarah working methodically. Now culpepper pulling pieces out,  trying to rearrange them. It is difficult. But once you start to figure out  how this puzzle working, you can get on a roll. Culpepper with another piece.  Sarah with another piece. Aubry starting to fall behind. Tai struggling. Troyzan  trying to get in on this. Cirie has yet to place a single piece. Culpepper  down to 12 pieces left. Sarah slowly, piece by piece, gaining on Brad's lead.  But it's Sarah and culpepper right now battling it out for immunity.  Culpepper now down to six pieces left. Sarah trying to catch up. Can she do  it? Culpepper reworking it now. Sarah looking for the right pieces. Culpepper  down to his last piece but something isn't right.  I'm missing pieces. No wonder.  Jeff: Culpepper now searching bags for a missing piece. And it's been in his  bag the entire time. Will that make a difference? Can Sarah catch culpepper?  Culpepper adds another. Culpepper down to his last two pieces. It would be  his third individual immunity win.  Got it, Jeff.  Jeff: He does. Culpepper wins individual immunity and reward!  Wow.  Jeff: Guaranteed a spot in the final five.  Holy...  Pretty good for a dumb jock.  Jeff: Culpepper, come on over. [ applause ]for the third time, individual  immunity is yours. You are safe tonight at tribal council. Cannot be voted  out of this game. In addition, you have won reward. Choose one person that  will join you at camp to enjoy this meal.  Troy.  Jeff: Didn't even hesitate with Troyzan.  He hasn't been on anything in a long time.  Jeff: Troyzan going to enjoy the meal tonight.  Thank you so much.  Jeff: Choose one more person. Everybody hungry. Big decision because you are  choosing one person to eat with you and three that will not.  Sarah.  Jeff: Sarah, come on over.  Thank you.  Jeff: All right, so here's what's going to happen. You guys are all going  back to camp. Food will be delivered for you three. After you eat, I’m will  see you tonight at tribal, where somebody will be the 15th person voted out  of this game and become the eighth member of the jury. It will not be you.  Congrats. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp, guys. See you guys at tribal.  Given the drama that happened at the last tribal council, i'm not really sure  where I’m stand with people. And this reward is what I’m needed. I've got to  find out who is willing to go to the end with me. And i'm going to do  whatever I’m have to do to solidify my spot.  I cannot even tell you how good this tastes. The fact that Brad won is just  outstanding. Brad and i, we're as solid as it gets. So if he wins, I’m win.  And I’m have an idol which I’m can play either tonight or the next tribal  council, which makes me feel safe. So I’m feel like i'm in a good place. But  we've got stuff to do. We have to win immunities. We have to play immunity  idols. We have to be smart. Amazing victory.  Thank you, Brad.  Let's do this thing.  I've got the legacy advantage, and nobody knows about it. So i'm lucky that  i'm safe tonight. But at this point, I’m have to go with people that are  gonna take me to the end. I’m felt betrayed by Cirie at tribal council, and Tai,  I’m clearly can't trust him. So the only choice I’m have right now is to go  with Brad and troy. Who do you guys want to vote out, though?  I think we put votes on Tai and votes on Aubry.  I think Aubry is a bigger immunity threat than him.  Let's all three vote Aubry.  Okay.  I'm gonna make him play an idol. Then we'll get him next. Tai informed me  this morning he has two idols. That puts Tai in a power position that makes  me super leery because i've seen him flip a couple of times. So I’m need to  get back to camp and make sure everybody is on the right page because I’m don't  want any funky business with two idols tonight.  What's up? Do you want to go to the end?  I want to go to the end.  Okay, good. Here's the plan. Aubry's going home. Okay?  Okay.  You're going to give me your other one to hold. Because I’m don't want any  funny business. It's just I’m need a leap of faith from you because of the  way things have been.  I know. Brad come back, and he said, "this is what needs to happen. Aubry's  going home, but in order to gain complete trust from me, you can't have both  idols. You need to give me one." and that raised a lot of alarm. I’m said  damn. I’m feel like a dog, someone leading me.  You want to go to the end, that's what you've got to do.  You're serious?  Listen, every single tribal council I’m have gone to has not gone as I’m expected.  And i'm not going in there tonight with you playing an idol and somebody else  playing an idol, and it all goes haywire.  Well, maybe you did. It's in my hands. Your destiny now is tonight, and  that's it. You've done that.  Brad was really intense and he created fear in me. But if I’m do that, he'll  bring me to the final three. I’m said, "great, now I’m belong  somewhere." but the back of my mind, I’m worry if I’m give the idol to Brad,  he'll make a fool out of me.  Two?  The only way i'll believe in you is if you give me the second idol.  I'm putting all my faith in you guys.  Just give it to him.  Not right now, I’m have to think thist through.  Tai showed me his two idols and i'm like holy crap. I’m guess in some way  he's reaching out like, "i want to be a trustworthy guy," but at  the same time, he's still acting sketchy.  The thing is he could play it tonight, he could play it tomorrow.  He's not getting it back. I'm getting it. We're voting him out tomorrow.  We're making him the fool.  You need to help me. I’m have an idol. Actually I’m have two idols. I’m showed  it to Brad. And he said, I’m won't go home. You're the one that's going home.  And he'll take me to the final. But the way he's telling me, he's bullying me  into it. So tonight play with you.  Okay.  But I’m tell you--  are you being straight with me, Tai?  I'm being so straight with you.  I know, I’m know. Okay, what do you want to do?  Cirie's here.  You gonna show her?  No.  I know, Tai, after everything, it's hard for you to trust me. I’m understand  that. However, if we don't do anything, they're going to just pick us off one  by one. At this point, Sarah, Troyzan, and Brad just came from the reward.  And i'm not sure what they discussed. After last night's tribal, i'd be  surprised if they weren't going to come after me. So I’m tried to tell Tai we  need to put all our differences aside and come together and get on rid one of  those three. We can't do Brad. It's either Sarah or Troyzan. We have to do  something. I’m promise I’m won't betray you. Right hand to God, I’m promise I’m  won't screw you, Tai. The only thing is, Tai knows everything that happened  to him last night was because of me, so i'm sure he doesn't trust me. Please,  Tai, i'm sorry--  go, go.  Okay, okay.  What do you want to do?  I don't know.  Once again, I’m feel like my life in the game is in Tai's hands, which kind  of sucks because 10 minutes before tribal, he's having an emotional  breakdown.  Like what?  Tai has two idols.  He's got two?  Yeah.  So did he give Brad one of them?  Not yet.  I can't decide what to do. Brad, he ordered me around. It's like a threat. At  the same time, I’m don't trust Cirie at all. She screwed me first. So how  dumb am I’m to fall on Cirie's trap?  Are we sure he's going to vote with us?  I don't know. What else do we have right now?  Nothing.  Honestly, nobody really cares about me. They just want something from me. And  it's painful. I’m don't know. I’m need to toughen up. I'm still here. I’m still  have two idols, and I’m just have to figure out what's best for me.  Jeff: We'll now brun bring in the members of our jury. Hali, Ozzy, Debbie, Zeke,  Sierra, "an draerk and Michaela voted out at the last tribal council.  All right, let's get straight into it. Aubry, what was your take on the  fallout from the last tribal?  There was a lot of talking when we went back to camp. It was kind of a  therapy session, and we kind of got to the bottom of what things were.  Jeff: What conclusion did you come to?  That we had a rat in our midst. Tai.  Jeff: Tai. Is that what happened? You went back to camp, and all the fingers  ended up pointing at you?  Yes. It did. It's a game of lie and deceit. Everybody lies. Everybody  deceives. But somehow, I’m was the only bad guy here and I’m take all the  blame.  But you were going to vote me out!  No.  You were. That's a lie right there.  Because Cirie told me you were targeting me first. This is a game of deceit  and a game of lying. Everybody does that.  Jeff: It sounds like Tai is making the point that we were all caught lying.  Why am I’m the one that's getting the most heat?  The reason all the heat is coming on Tai is because he's not taking any  responsibility for his lies.  I think this is so hypocritical.  It's not. I’m have not lied to you.  Hypocritical.  Your whole alliance wanted you out yesterday.  Jeff: Sarah, it's an interesting situation. There's a group of six. Three  shared a reward today. Are you concerned that with Brad choicing Troyzan and  you, that the appearance would be that the three of are you tight, and that  might push these three to try to do something?  I think at this point, you have five people that are tight.  Jeff: Meaning everybody but Tai?  Yeah. Clearly, you can tell by the way everybody's frustrated with Tai that  nobody's on the same page as Tai right now.  Jeff: Troyzan, is it likely that Tai could recover this late in the game?  Honestly, I’m say no, like, 90% no.  Jeff: Cirie, have you ever seen somebody in this kind of a hole before?  This game is like no other. I've seen people in worse holes than this and  somehow make it to the end. So I’m never say "never."  Jeff: So, Tai, where are you right now, emotionally, day 36? You've made it  to six. You have a lot of enemies right now.  They all say i'm doing all the lying. On top of that, there was a  conversation with me already. A lot of offers, a lot of bribes. Like  threaten. As well.  Jeff: So you're saying people came to you and offered to make a deal with  you.  Yes.  Jeff: Culpepper, are you surprised to hear Tai say he was approached today  with offers?  No, I’m mean, we're late in the game. You need numbers. So it makes sense  that someone would try to repair something fair vote.  Jeff: Does it concern you?  Buyer beware if you try to do a deal with Tai. It could maybe benefit you or  bite you in the ass.  Jeff: Tai, what do you think is going to happen tonight?  The only thing I’m know is my vote, who i'm writing down. That's the only  thing I’m can tell.  Jeff:you how about you, Cirie? How confident are you about tonight's vote?  I feel as confident as the people around me that I’m can trust. Which is not  saying a lot.  Jeff: Wow. Aubry, this game truly is alive and moving moment by moment. You  think there's something stable, and then it shifts.  I don't know. I’m feel like i've been kind of hanging on by the bottom rung,  and i'm going to keep the faith tonight.  Jeff: All right, it is time to vote. Sarah, you're up. Sarah, you're up.  Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you  want to play it, now would be the time to do so.  Jeff. I'd like to play this for myself.  Jeff: Okay. And I’m have another one. A red one. I’m would like it play for Aubry.   Jeff: Thanks, Tai.  Thank you.  Jeff: These are both hidden immunity idols. Any votes cast for Tai and Aubry,  will not count.  Hey, Jeff. This is a secret advantage which is a legacy advantage. This is  only good for right now. And I’m don't need a souvenir. So there you go.  Jeff: All right. This is the legacy advantage. Any votes cast for Sarah will  not count.  Jeff. [ laughter ]  oh!  Oh, my God!  I'm going to get on the immunity train and give you that, because I’m just  feel like being in the final five.  Jeff: All right. This is also a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Troyzan  will not count. So, any votes cast for Tai, Aubry, Sarah, Troyzan, will not  count. You could not vote for culpepper. He had immunity, which means Cirie,  it doesn't matter what votes are in the urn, because the only person who can  receive votes...  Is me.  Jeff: Is you. For what it's worth, not a single vote in here has your name on  it. This is a historic tribal council. Most idols ever played at a tribal,  three. Most people ever safe at a tribal, five. And the most significant and  devastating part of tonight's history-making tribal for you, Cirie, is you  become the first person in 34 seasons to be voted out simply because their  literally is no other choice. There's no need to revote.  Wow.  Jeff: Cirie, you came out here 11 years ago to play this game. You've played  it four times now. You famously got up off the couch to see what you were  made of. You had another moment this season where you conquered a personal  obstacle. If this is the end of your "Survivor" run, what is the  story?  This has been one of the most grand experiences of my life. It changed me. I’m  would have never done any of this stuff if I’m didn't get off that couch 11  years ago. I’m would never have met so many different people. I’m would have  never had so many amazing experiences. So it's bittersweet. However, i'm  going out in grand style. It never happened before. And it just makes this  experience that much more special for me.  Jeff: Cirie, how many days of "Survivor" have you played now?  Not enough.  Jeff: Cirie, I’m have to say, you have played every day of "Survivor"  with grace, and it has been an honor to have you be a part of the "Survivor"  family. You are the 15th voted out of this season. You become the eighth  member of the jury. You need to grab your torch.  Sure. [ applause ]  Jeff: Cirie, you want to say it?  The tribe has spoken. [ laughs ] oh! Thank you, Jeff.  Jeff: Time for you to go.  Jeff: Thank you, Cirie.  Jeff: Well, a "Survivor" legend goes out in legendary style. You  have made it to the final five. But this game is clearly far from over. Grab  your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.  It's a very bittersweet moment for me. But i'm so thankful to have had every  single day. I'm going to encourage my boys and my family to get off the couch  and live because look at what you miss out on if you don't try. Look out,  world. You never know where you might see Cirie. [ cheers and applause ].  Jeff: Well, they don't come much classier than Cirie. Cirie, come out here.  So close, and once again, a unique set of circumstances. Come here, girl! [  cheers and applause ] look at that!  Oh, my God!  Jeff: What does that feel like, a standing ovation?  Um... Wow.  Jeff: Take it in. You've given a lot. Take some back. Thank you. All right,  let's hear what she has to say. So, Cirie, first, that. And, you know, it's  interesting to me that I’m rarely comment on somebody personally in "Survivor."  I’m try to remain neutral, even though people would say that's not true. But  with you, in that moment, it was undeniable to say what a part of this and  what you represent. So what is it liketo come out here after a decade of  exposing yourself to all of your vulnerabilities and feel that love?  It's amazing. I’m don't feel worthy. It's-- life changing. It just-- it tells  the world what a great thing a great game this is, and what you can  accomplish if you just try. These people would have never known Cirie  fieldes.  Jeff: I'm going to hug you now. Oh, you're one of a kind. "Survivor: Game  changers," season finale. So far from over. Next time I’m see you, i'll  have the votes. Enjoy it, woman! Take a bow! [ cheers and applause ] all  right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? First things  first, for the third time, culpepper other I’m will take it back. Once again,  immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to use  paddles to maneuver a ball through a series of obstacles. If the ball drops,  you go back to the start and begin again. The first person to transfer three  balls to the finish wins immunity. Safe from the vote, guaranteed a spot in  the final four. Losers, tribal council, where somebody will be the 16th  person voted out of "Survivor," become the ninth member of our  jury. We'll draw for spots and we'll get started. All right, here we go. For  immunity. Guaranteed spot in the final four. Survivors ready? Go. Definitely  a learning curve to this challenge. You're going to be dropping balls and  starting over. That's part of it. Sarah working on that first transition.  She's got it. Culpepper makes that first transition. Tai is through his first  obstacle. Sarah's through that second obstacle. Culpepper working around that  second obstacle. Tai now heading for the second obstacle. Tai drops. He's got  to go back. Sarah naf gates that third obstacle. Culpepper right at the third  obstacle. Aubry and Troyzan struggling to get out of the gate.  What the hell am I’m doing?  Jeff: Culpepper neither that final obstacle. Sarah right behind him. It's  culpepper and Sarah at the same spot in the challenge. Culpepper makes the  final transition. Sarah does not. Sarah has to go back. Culpepper now very  close to the finish with his first ball. Culpepper drops and has his first of  three balls. Culpepper now knows it is possible. He can do it. Tai, Aubry, Troyzan  trying to get something going. Aubry having no luck at all. Sarah now at the  third obstacle. Culpepper now at the third obstacle. But he's on his second  ball. Culpepper naf gates it now, heading into that final obstacle. Sarah  still sitting on that third obstacle, ball really moving and it drops. Sarah  once again losing all of her progress, has to begin again. Culpepper very  close to finishing his second ball. Culpepper has his second ball. One ball  left for immunity. It would be culpepper's fourth individual immunity win and  would put him within striking distance of the "Survivor" record,  which is five, held by a very small and elite group. Troyzan at the fourth  and final obstacle. He's got to move. Troyzan drops. All progress lost. Has  to start again. Nobody else even close. Culpepper working his way up that  final obstacle. Aubry just going to watch now. It would be a dominating  fourth individual immunity win within one of the record. Culpepper wins his  fourth individual immunity! Guaranteed a spot in the final four!  Nice job, Brad.  Jeff: Culpepper, come on over. [ applause ] that was for monica.  Jeff: Where is the emotion? What's happening? That one was for her?  Yeah, yeah.  Jeff: Fourth individual immunity win. Culpepper is guaranteed a spot in the  final four. You will see day 38. As for everybody else, for somebody, this is  the end. Tribal council tonight. Somebody will be the 16th person voted out  of this game and the ninth member of our jury. Grab your stuff. Head back to  camp. See you tonight at tribal. Congrats.  Thank you.  Brad smoked us all, and the tough part is Brad doesn't seem to really want to  work with me. So I’m feel like I’m could be going home. So i'm going to make  a pitch to save myself, but I’m need the numbers right now.  Nicely done!  How did do you that?  I've got one of those in my house. I’m won my fourth individual immunity  today. Walking into those challenges, i'm so focused on what i've got to do  that all I’m think about is the challenge itself. Being a part of the record  is a side note. My eye of eye is on the prize and I’m think i'm really close  to take the bell.  You're looking kind of golden right now, buddy.  This is gonna be the easiest vote of the whole season.  We want Aubry out, correct?  Correct.  Okay.  My alliance is solid with Brad and Sarah is with us as well. That's a  majority. So we're going to vote out Aubry next because when it comes to the  fienlt tribal council speeches, Tai is easier to beat. But you tell me what's  been easy in this game, and i'll be like this. This is-- zero. Nothing's been  easy.  I think that there are some very clear things in this game. Like, if i'm not  hir tomorrow and Brad wins immunity again, you guys have a 50% shot of making  the final three because he's keeping Troyzan, no matter.  If we get rid of troy--  it maximizes.  We have to pick between the two of us. If Brad wins the immunity challenge  tomorrow he will be taking Troyzan to the finale with him. Then Sarah and Tai  each have a 50% shot at vying for that final spot. If, however, we make a  move tonight together to take out Troyzan, that leaves two spots open. I’m don't  want to be wiped out by the boys.  I agree.  After we have worked together off and on or whatever. This is a chance to  say, look, we actually pulled it together when it mattered.  Right. I’m agree. The story of my game this whole season is i'm always in the  middle. So i've got a decision to make tonight. But first, I’m need to make  sure that I’m can trust Tai.  We're good, right, you and i?  Well, are we?  Yes. Yeah. Because you were--  if you knew out of anyone in this entire game you are the one person they  cared about the whole time. And that's why I’m got so hurt.  Because you felt-- yeah.  Tai, i'm telling you, i've had your back the whole game.  I know.  So give me what you would like to do, and i'll tell you if I’m think it's a  good idea or not.  I think get Aubry out.  Is that what you want to do? If you want to, i'm okay with that.  Are you okay with that?  Yeah.  I love Aubry as a person. But she's also a really good player. So she's the  one who needs to go home because I’m can't beat her.  I'll shake with you right now.  I'll shake with you. We're not going home tonight. And we're voting out Aubry.  Perfect.  Tai, i'll just put it to you like this-- I’m control who goes to final four.  I’m do.  Yes, you do.  I can control who goes to final four. I’m give you to tomorrow, you have to  assure me from hereon out, you're voting whatever I’m vote.  Okay.  It's not complicated.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you understand that?  Yes.  Okay.  Do you believe that? I’m believe it. You're very sincere. Every time you say  it, I’m believe it.  It's not about me. It's what you believe. Are you really gog have my back  tonight and tomorrow night?  I will have your back tonight and tomorrow night.  Vote Aubry.  Yeah.  I'll see what you vote because i'm going to be here tomorrow.  Brad and I’m happen to want the same thing, but the way he talked to me is,  like, I’m am the minority or subserveiant or something. It's not an equal  partnership. He has no respect for me. He's intimidating big time to me  because i'm a little guy. Brad and I’m talked. He said if I’m don't want to  go home tonight, I’m have to make him a promise.  Okay.  They vote whatever he tell me tonight. And he said I’m have no choice but to  go with him plans. I’m don't take orders from nobody. We can flip on him.  Okay.  And vote freeway zahn, we flip on him tonight.  Tonight is huge. This could be a million-dollar move. And sure enough, Tai is  changing his mind again at the last minute. Tonight is actually the biggest  vote of the game. It's going to determine who will be in the final four. So Tai  and I’m have to figure out which way to go. So Tai and I’m have to figure out  which way to go.  Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Hali. Ozzy. Debbie. Zeke. Sierra.  Andrea. Michaela. And Cirie, voted out at the last tribal council. All right,  so let's get straight into it. Culpepper's fourth individual immunity win. Troyzan,  what's the feeling for you when you see it happening again and again? Because  we're at the point in the game now where culpepper could win his way to the  end.  Yeah, it's tough, you know. The last time I’m played, you know, I’m felt like  challenges were my deal. And looking at this guy just romp through it like  it's nothing. It's tough to see and it's, you know, i'm hoping that the next  challenge, if i'm there, will be something right down my alley.  Jeff: Aubry, why are you smiling during this? We're talking about culpepper  dominating, and you're smiling.  I mean, that's "Survivor." sometimes it's with you, and sometimes  it's not.  Jeff: Where is it for you tonight?  I'm definitely on the chopping block.  Jeff: So, Sarah, what does the conversation center around with five people  left?  People are just trying to survive one day at a time right now. It's kind of  where the conversation circulates is how do I’m make it through tonight's  tribal council?  Jeff: So, Troyzan, is everybody pitching everybody?  Yeah, pretty much, that's how it goes because this is where it's critical  that you basically negotiate yourself into a final three thing.  Jeff: Aubry, this really is about final three at this point.  It is. And you know the social dynamics and you can make some logical  conclusions about where things are going, and I’m believe that Brad and Troyzan  will be two of the spots in the final three if one of them wins immunity  tomorrow. So if someone wants to have a higher chance of going to the end,  there's another way to go.  Jeff: Which would be voting out Troyzan. That's only option. You can't vote  out culpepper.  Yes.  Jeff: Tai did Aubry pitch thu?  Yeah. Aubry has talked to me about it with percentage. It's interesting  argument and i'm taking that into consideration.  Jeff: Sarah, what would be the advantage of going with Aubry's strategy?  At that point, that's where you have to start considering who you're willing  to put on the jury and who you would like to sit next to. And what's right  for me, what's right for Aubry, what's right for Tai could all be the same  thing or they could all be different things. I'm not sure.  Jeff: Troyzan are, you aware that there's this feeling that you and culpepper  are connected?  Not as much as Aubry says because that's her opinion. How do you know I’m don't  win immunity and there's two spots left with me. So, hello.  Jeff: Culpepper, just because you have immunity today doesn't mean you can  sit on your hands because you have to make sure that if you don't win the  next challenge, you've got a shot.  Absolutely. I’m mean, i've talked to everybody just like everybody else  talked to everybody else. But from what i'm hearing tonight tsounds like I’m have  to win to get in.  Jeff: Culpepper, are there people in the game for you think if I’m go to the  end with them, i'm not sure I’m could win?  Yes.  Jeff: How about you, sara, people you are concerned you can't beat?  Absolutely.  Jeff: Tai?  Yup, definitely.  Jeff: How about you, Aubry?  Yeah, there are people I’m think I’m can't beat.  Jeff: Troyzan?  No.  Jeff: So you feel confident.  Yes.  Wow.  Jeff: Sarah, it is interesting that Aubry's case is against Troyzan, and Troyzan  is the one guy that says, "i can beat anybody here in this game."  you know, if Troyzan feels he can beat everybody here, then maybe he's not  someone I’m want to go with. So if it's about a final three right now  tonight, then you better pick the right final three.  Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Aubry, you're up.  Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you  want to play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are  read, the decision it final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the  tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Aubry. Troyzan.  One vote Aubry, one vote Troyzan. Aubry. Two votes Aubry, one vote Troyzan.  16th person voted out and the ninth member of our jury, Aubry. That's three  upon. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.  Jeff: Aubry, the tribe has spoken.  The full experience!  Jeff: You can leave it here.  Oh!  Jeff: Well, you've made it to the final four. Tomorrow, you will compete in  your final immunity challenge. You are this close. Grab your torches. Head  back to camp. Good night.  I decide to not be cagey and go for broke if tribal, but "Survivor"  has taught me you can't control everything, and I’m gave it my best shot. And  I’m took everything that I’m could from the experience. I'm so excited to be  on the jury. I'm so freaking excited to watch these psychopaths.  Jeff: All right, you guys ready to get to your final immunity challenge?  Yes.  Yes.  Jeff: First things first, culpepper, for the fourth time, I’m will take it  back. For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's  challenge, you're going to race through an obstacle and down a giant water  slide conflicting bags of puzzle pieces as you go. Once you have all three  bags, you'll use the pieces inside to solve a lighthouse puzzle. First on  finish guarantees themselves a spot at that final tribal council. Losers, one  of you will be the 17th person voted out and the tenth and final member of  our jury. This is the biggest challenge of the game. Win, you go to the end.  Lose, you may not. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. Good luck. All  right, here we go. Final immunity, guaranteed a spot at that final tribal  council. Survivors ready? Go! First job, untie those knots, get that for us  ring of keys and head through the obstacle. Who will be out of the gate  first? It is culpepper. Then Sarah. Then Tai and Troyzan. Got to make your  way through that first obstacle. Halfway through, you're going to get your  first bag of pieces and you've got multiple keys. You need a little luck  right here to find the right one as a matter asfast as possible. Sarah has  her first bag. Troyzan has his first bag. Sarah flying through this obstacle.  Culpepper now has his first bag. Tai has his first bag. Troyzan heading down.  Sarah heading up for her second set of keys. Troyzan heading back out.  Culpepper and Tai side by side with their first bags, down the pole they go.  Get them on the table and head out! It is Sarah up the slide first. You have  to untie that second set of keys. Sarah has it, down the slide. Dhoothat's  how do you it. Culpepper has his second set of keys. Troyzan working on his  second set. Troyzan has his keys. He's headed down. Culpepper heading down  now with his second set of keys. Here comes Tai! Sarah releases her second bag,  still in the lead. Troyzan at his second bag. Culpepper is at his second bag.  Tai at his second bag. Everybody trying keys now as Sarah extends her lead.  Culpepper's got his second set heading down. Troyzan still working on his  second set. Tai has his second set of puzzle pieces. He's heading down. Sarah  has her third and final set of keys. Tai heading up now. Troyzan still trying  to release that second set. He is losing a lot of time. Sarah in the lead.  Culpepper in second. And Tai. Here comes culpepper. He's good to go heading  through the obstacle for the final time. Tai has his third set of keys. Troyzan  finally has his second bag. Sarah now working on her third and final bag of  puzzle pieces. Culpepper right behind her. Here comes Troyzan, trying to get  back in this. Tai now heading for his third bag. Culpepper gets his quickly!  It is now culpepper in the lead. Sarah taking a long time, has lost her lead.  Sarah now has her third bag. It is culpepper and Sarah now working on their  puzzle. Tai has his third bag. Troyzan has his third and final set of keys!  Let's go! It is Tai, culpepper, and Sarah. Troyzan needs to get lucky quickly  and find the right key fast if he's going to be in this. Final immunity  challenge, all the marbles, right here. Troyzan has his third bag. He's back  in this! Everybody is in this. This is what you want in the final challenge  of "Survivor," everybody competing for the win. Tai has his first  piece. Culpepper has his first piece. Culpepper has his second piece. Troyzan  looking for the first piece, and he's got it. Culpepper with the third piece.  Sarah just looking to get on the board. Culpepper with his fourth piece. Tai  with his second piece. Culpepper with his fifth piece. He took the lead at  the very end and does not want to give it up now. Tai with the third piece. Sarah  still struggling. Now he's got one as culpepper adds another. Tai with his  fourth piece. Sarah adds a piece. Culpepper down to his last piece. He just  needs the top. Now you've got to untie your three number tiles and use them  to solve a combination lock. That holds the top of the lighthouse, so you are  close, but not there yet. Tai with a fifth piece. Tai is the only one who has  a shot right now at catching culpepper. Culpepper has it. He's got the top!  For the win. Culpepper wins his fifth individual immunity, guaranteed a spot  at the final tribal council! Where he will get a chance to plead his case for  the million dollars and the title of "sole Survivor." culpepper,  come on over.  My old friend.  Jeff: Once again, immunity is yours. A couple of significant things. With  this win, you join a very small group of people who have won five individual  immunity challenges in a single season. The bigger news, with this win, you  are guaranteed awe spot at the final tribal. One big decision left in this  game-- who will go to the final three with you, and who will become the tenth  and final member of our jury, their dream falling this short. Grab your  stuff. Head back to camp. See you guys tone at tribal. Congrats.  After winning five immunity challenges i'm clearly in control of this game.  I'm in the final three, and quite frankly, I’m think I’m can beat every  single one of them but but as for tonight, Tai has betrayed me this game and  so he's going home and it's good to be the king. [ laughter ]  oh, my God.  Did you it!  Oh, my God.  He was pretty close, though.  He did a lot better than I’m thought he would.  I know. &gt;. I knew I’m was going to win that challenge. I’m was so prepared mentally,  that in my head I’m had already won it before I’m started, and this necklace  makes me bulletproof. I'm going to the final three and it's my decision who  is going home and it comes down to who has done me wrong the most. And that  would be Tai.  I think we should just tell him. Just let him down easy.  No, no.  No?  No.  It's my island right now.  Okay, i'm just throwing it out there.  I know. But i'd rather him think he's got some glimmer of hope, and i'm going  to let him down at tribal. He's done nothing but backstab me this whole game.  I’m said, "buddy, give me an idol and we'll go to the end." he did  not give me the idol. He played that.  Were you going to fulfill that?  No.  You're going in and Sarah is going in. As far as jury is concerned, after  winning five immunity challenges, I’m know I’m can beat both Troyzan and Sarah,  because after football, I’m became a trial attorney, so I’m think I’m can  sell my case better to the jury. I'm in control, and Tai is going to get what  he deserves.  I know. One of us is going home.  Yeah. Right now, I’m think the most obvious, logical conclusion is Brad will  vote me out for betraying himself so many times and now my life's on the  line. I’m have to come up with something. Otherwise, all this was for  nothing.  It's whoever those who vote for.  Yeah.  You want to bet that or do you want to take a 50-50 chance?  How?  Make fire. You and I’m vote for troy. I’m think you can take troy down. I’m can  take troy down. At fire. And we both go to final together.  Brad and Troyzan have been tight the entire game, so, clearly, they're going  to make a move against me or Tai. So he said let's vote for Troyzan, and  force a tie, which would come down to a fire-making challenge. I’m have to  consider it. Even though it scares the crap out of me. I'm not super good at  fire.  I don't think Troyzan is very good at making fire.  Yeah, probably not.  I think we can do it.  Brad's pretty cocky right now and thinks he's calling the shots. But i'm  thinking, screw that. If I’m can win a fire-making challenge, I’m can decide  who's going to the final three.  The jury hates me. They do. Because I’m appear like a liar. I’m just have  that feeling. Like they don't think i'm a good player.  Yeah. Tai's telling me that he can't win. But he's made moves and found three  idols. So he has a resume. However, Tai is so all over the place, he might  have alienated the jury. And then there's Troyzan, who hasn't done anything  without Brad's permission this whole game. But at the same time, he hasn't  made anyone mad. And Sandra won twice by not making anyone mad. How do you  start-- like, what do you need to do?  So when you make fire, make a nest. Shave the flint.  Okay.  Watch the wind.  I think I’m can do it. If I’m do this and win, I’m could rack up a ton of  points with the jury. But I’m have to decide if this is a risk that i'm  willing to take. It's a coin flip, and i've got to pick heads or Tails. It's  a coin flip, and i've got to pick heads or Tails.  Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Hali. Ozzy. Debbie. Zeke. Sierra.  Andrea. Michaela. Cirie. And Aubry, voted out at the last tribal council. All  right, so, last big decision to be made by you guys tonight, who you're going  to send over to that jury and which three will get to face the jury.  Culpepper, first, congratulations. Your fifth individual immunity win. Tell  me about the moment right after you won it.  It's an amazing feeling when it happened. I’m know i'm guaranteed a 39th day.  But now i've got to figure out who we want to put on the jury, so it's that--  that could affect tomorrow's vote and everything else.  Jeff: Sarah when culpepper says, "now we have to decide who to put on  the jury," who is the "we?"  i think he's implying himself and Troyzan, which would leave Tai and myself  on the chopping block.  Jeff: Tai, does that ring true?  That's absolutely true that Sarah and I’m are at the bottom. One of us is  going to go home tonight. But if we work together, our chance might go up.  Because we, obviously, can't vote for culpepper. And if we join forces we can  vote for Troyzan.  Jeff: And force a tie.  Force a tie.  Jeff: So, sara, did you guys talk about it?  93, that's exactly what could happen tonight.  Jeff: Where do you sit with that? Because you're weighing a lot? For me,  personally, my decision is going to come from who doiment to sit with in a  final three?  But both of cuss get to the final three, you know. If I’m was sara, I’m would  say, well, you cannot be absolute sure. I’m mean, culpepper told me if I’m gave  him one of my idols for him to hold on to, they could buy back his trust. I’m  mean, he just thinks like i'm so naive. I'm like I’m have a brain. It's  common sense.  But you have no leverage. I've got the necklace. You're in the minority. I'm  giving you an opportunity. I'm throwing you a lifeline, but nothing's for  free.  That's fine. But you treating me like a little child, like a little  simpleton, "give meet idol."  you chose--  i decide on my own term how my destination is.  Jeff: Troyzan, the tough part about tonight for you is you have no idea if  that is the truth or part of a scheme to make somebody else feel safe when  they're not.  Well, yeah, this is the first news I’m have of a tie happening. And it seems  like every day, every hour, there's been something crazy happen. So it  wouldn't be out of the normal for me to go, "wow" again, and say,  "okay, here we go. Break out the sticks, and let's build a fire."  Jeff: Brad, this is not a revolutionary idea to think if norsiforcing a tie  if you think two are tight. This is basic "Survivor" strategy. We  can up our odds by forcing a tie and going to fire.  Absolutely, if they both feel uncomfortable, they can absolutely do that.  Jeff: Tai, how do you feel about this?  There's some doubt. There's got to be, that they're voting for you, not for  me. Whatever they're telling you, who knows if it's true or not.  Jeff: Troyzan, it's one simple vote to get to the end, but there are all  these possibilities.  It's never a simple vote, Jeff. So i'm going to put my trust in myself  because i'm trusting my intuition, and if it's right, i'll walk out of here a  final three guy. If i'm not, i'm building a fire tonight.  Jeff: All right, Sarah, Tai, Troyzan, one of you is about to be the tenth and  final member of our jury. It is time to vote. Troyzan, you're up.  This is the hardest name that i've had to write down this season.  Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read the decision is final.  Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.  I'll read the votes. First vote, Tai. Troyzan. Tai. That's two votes Tai, one  vote Troyzan, one vote left. 17th person voted out and the final member of  our jury, Tai. You need to bring me your torch.  Friends for life, buddy.  Yeah.  Jeff: Tai, the tribe has spoken.  Thank you, Jeff for a great season.  Jeff: Thank you for coming back.  Appreciate it.  Jeff: Time for you to go.  Jeff: Congratulations. You made it to the final three. You have one more  night in beautiful fiji. We'll see you here tomorrow night for your final  tribal council. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.  I would like to be on the final three and possibly could have won. I’m mean,  I’m did a lot, idol, made a couple of big moves, socially, people liked me. I’m  mean, this is a really tough game. But I’m bounced back, and i'll just grow  stronger. Âª âª  39, baby. 39 days. Who would have thunk it? This was a dream they truly put  out there 16 years ago when I’m watched the first episode. I'm like, "i  want to be the sole Survivor." and to get to the three almost feels like  i'm there.  Are you crying?  Yeah. It's just emotional.  Oh!  No, it's the smoke. My social game was real. I’m have the ability to speak to  people openly, and I’m worked that angle from the bottom to the middle to the  top the whole game. I’m think that's what helped me because people did trust  me, never wrote my name down, and I’m got to day 39. Maybe this season your  personality, your loyalty, your game play from the inside maybe will count  more. And I’m got a good feeling about this. Holy mackerel. Three baskets.  Oh, look at the muffins.  Look at that, guys. Well-deserved meal.  Wooo!  Final three.  Final three.  Final three.  Day 39.  Way to go.  Knowing they am in the final three is the best feeling in the world.  This is a good meal right here.  It's what you dream of when Jeff says the word "go" on day one.  You guys are gonna want to eat pancakes. I’m worked my butt off to get here.  I’m made moves that other people were scared to make. I’m made moves that I’m  was scared to make. And i'm very proud of how I’m played. Brad, are you even  nervous about tonight?  Not really.  As a police officer, I’m don't respect being lied to. It makes me feel like  you think that i'm stupid. But i'm the criminal tonight. And those people on  the jury are the police officers. So if they're asking for the truth, i'm  going to give them the truth because I’m reward honesty. I’m hope they reward  my honesty tonight.  The whole day i've been thinking about, okay, what have I’m done? And I’m feel  that i'm in a good position because i've been a game changer and maneuvered  my way to where I’m controlled my destiny this entire game. I've won five  immunity challenges. I’m put myself here. I’m wasn't drug here. I’m did it on  my own. And I’m brought the people I’m want with me here. I’m don't need the  money, but I’m desperately want to win. Winning the game of "Survivor"  means everything to me. And I’m can argue my case at the end of the day and  walk out of trial thinking i've got it. Slam dunk. But quite frankly, I’m have  not been in a trial for a million-dollar case case. I'm kind of in a trial  for a million-dollar case tonight. I'm kind of in a trial for a  million-dollar case tonight.  Jeff: We'll now bring in your jury. Hali. Ozzy. Debbie. Zeke. Sierra. Andrea.  Michaela. Cirie. Aubry. And Tai, voted out at the last tribal council. So  welcome to the final tribal council of "Survivor: Game changers."  it has been a season full of firsts-- most idols ever played at one tribal--  three. Most people ever safe at one tribal-- five. First person in Cirie ever  voted out simply because there was no one else to vote for. First time the  steal a vote was played effectively when sarla used it to knock out Michaela.  Culpepper with five individual immunity wins joins a very elite group that  includes Ozzy. We also have a new leader in most days played on "Survivor,"  Ozzy at 128 days, followed right behind with Cirie, at 121.  Nice!  Congratulations.  Jeff: So given that this is "Survivor: Game changers," and that  there have been so many firsts, it seems only appropriate that we end with  another first. We're anything to change tribal council up this year. In a way  that will allow for a more open discussion between the jury and the final  three. We're going to center it around the three aspects of the game--  outwit, outplay, outlast. Outwit would be the social part of the game, the  emotional intelligence, your alliances, relationships you had outside of  those alliances. The outplay portion would be how you respond to the  conditions put on you by the game. You have to build shelter. You have to  compete in challenges. There are switches. There will be twists. How do you  respond to the hand you're dealt? And the final phase, outlast. Most  critical. Did you put people on the jury who respect the we you outwitted and  outplayed more than the other two? And if not, tonight is your last chance to  sway them. I'm going to give you a moment to take it in. We'll get started. Âª âª  Jeff: All right, let's start with the outwit portion of the game, the social  part of "Survivor." who wants to address Sarah, Brad, or Troyzan  first?  I'll do it.  Jeff: Okay.  Sarah, on day three of this game, I’m gave you my jacket. And then I’m was  blindsided, and every night, you wore my jacket to tribal council. And all I’m  could think was, "hot damn! That is bad ass." you made such amazing  relationships. Sierra, whom you were responsible for voting out, gave you the  legacy advantage because she didn't process that you were responsible for  controlling this game. So, Sarah, I’m am your champion tonight. And I’m wish  you the best.  Thank you.  I am going to say, i'm in such a dilemma here. So, you know, Sarah, you had  some brilliant game moves, really. Like, you convinced everyone here that  they were your best friend. And you brought people's personal feel intotion  it and emotions. And I’m feel-- I’m feel kind of gross. Did you know that you  were going to have this effect on people? Yes, on one side, I’m can respect,  hey, she fooled us all. But am I’m going to feel good about that vote?  I want everyone over there to know, my personal relationships were 100% real  from the bottom of my heart. [ laughing ].  Well, i'm just trying to be honest.  I think the problem is why should we trust what you're saying to us right  now? Look, I’m played this game, as we found out, more than anybody else.  There is a way to play this game without going as low as you had to go.  Yeah. I’m lied. But it's what I’m had to do sit here, and I’m was flog do  whatever it took.  Then again, somebody like Brad, who as a competitor, I’m give you props. You  get put into a position where you've got to win, win, win, win, win. And  nobody-- very few people, you and I’m and a few other people-- understand how  hard that is. And he didn't have to get his hands dirty. He could do it in a  way that was more clean and more loyal. So I’m will be Brad's champion at  this point.  Jeff: Cirie, social part of the game, outwit. What's on your mind?  Brad, most of us sitting here voted Sierra out because we knew she was the  brains of your operation and that without her, you and Troyzan probably would  have just bumped into each other. Explain how she didn't run the first  portion of your game.  When I’m landed on the beach, I’m started working with people, with Tai, with  Sierra. Most importantly, with J.T. I’m was able to make the game-changing, I’m  think, move of the season, when we ended up going to tribal council with two  groups. But I’m had built such a good relationship with J.T., that he came to  me in the middle of the whole tribal council and told me exactly who they  were voting out, and I’m saved Sierra that night. And i'm calling it the  turning point of the game because I’m got rid of Malcolm, and we all might  not be here if Malcolm were here.  I'll put in an opinion. From the outside looking in, it did look like Sierra  was the brains of the operation. But considering that this is a social game  built on relationships, i'm interested to know how much you actually know  about me.  Well, you're from texas. You went to texas christian. You have-- you work  with a sales company for vacations. I’m mean... What-- what do you want to  know, you know?  Wow.  No further questions.  Then--  i mean, Brad, that's maybe where you were lacking. I’m mean, sara, even  though a lot of us feel gross about tshe developed personal relationships.  However, sara, i'm actually just curious how did you it. How did you Manage  people's personal feelings and emotions?  Sarah, before you answer that, i'm shocked to learn that-- that Sarah was  doing all these things abuse what I’m had with you was, I’m thought was real.  [ laughter ] now coming from your mouth. We all had the same experience with  you. So tell me--  well, my first season, I’m played who I’m was in real life. And that got Sarah  nowhere. And my support systems at home basically gave me the permission to  open the floodgates and do whatever I’m needed.  But I’m think what Andrea is asking is not for a generality. What  specifically allows you to say, "this is real Sarah. This is game Sarah?"   honestly, it comes from being a police officer for the last 10 years, working  under cover. When you're under cover, you have to shut off who are you and be  someone else. You're buying drugs, you're a drug user now. If you're a  prostitute, you're a prostitute. I’m have to play a role of someone I’m am  not. And I’m get what you're saying that it's scary how it shuts on and off,  but I’m have to do that for a living.  But, you know, if the ends don't justify the means, then what does? Think  machiavelli the prince, lady mcbeth. You know you want to win this game and  you do it at all costs. I’m have zero respect for you and your game play, and  that's why I’m am his lieutenant in arms for you, Brad, because she never  would have been sitting there without you.  Jeff: Michaela, you have a look on your face to Debbie's comment.  I guess I’m don't understand the emotional feeling that people have towards Sarah.  Like, even when Sarah used the advantage to vote me out, it wasn't something  they took personally. I’m was just, like, good thing you got rid of me,  because i'm the only one that could beat Brad. However, I’m did want to ask a  question of Troyzan--  wow!  What can you tell the jury what you actually did from a social perspective in  this game?  Well, you know, i've talked to every single one of you, and I’m had personal  relationships. And I’m was ready to have an alliance with all of you, if that  was to my benefit. But it was difficult for me to may full out because I’m felt  like I’m was playing with, like, two loved ones--  hold on, hold on. From my standpoint, there's a difference between being a  passenger and being a driver.  I'm sitting here, though. I'm sitting here. And you're sitting there.  For sure.  What's the difference.  For sure.  I made moves nooufs basically help my game. When I’m got to the merge, I’m got  together with six people they knew I’m could trust at that point. And if they  wanted to vote you out, of course, i'm going to do that.  But I’m said "they" wanted to. You didn't say "i" wanted  to. Then you were a passenger like he's saying.  Yeah, Troyzan, in terms of the decision making what, role did you play in is  that tha?  Well, it wasn't as direct to say, "this islet person. That's the  person." I’m did things in a sense more sneaky and made suggestions --  i'm hearing it's a little bit of can "anyone but me." a little bit Sandra  without the fat.  It's a little bit "anyone but me." but I’m can make moves from the  from the middle or the bottom just as easy.  It sounds like you're sitting in the right place.  Uh-huh.  I want to say people who didn't get in an alliance didn't get to see the way  he played. You were a part of votes. You just did it in a more subtle way.  Thank you.  Own it. It's not done yet.  Thank you.  Jeff: Andrea, weigh in on culpepper's social part of the game, the outwit  portion.  Okay, Brad, you played a pretty solid game. You were loyal. You won a bunch  of immunities. But you never reached out and tried to form relationships with  people on the bottom, people like Michaela, and you were very nasty towards  people like Tai. So I’m would love to hear your thoughts on that.  As far as Michaelaa, for whatever reason, Michaela and I’m were oil and  water. I’m don't know why. You and I’m just didn't connect. And you talk  about Tai, basically, I’m must have been doing something right socially  because you told me hutwo idols. So I’m was trying to do everything I’m could  to make you uncomfortable to make you either give me an idol so I’m could  protect you or you played both your idols.  I think-- do you realize how you talk to people? Do you realize the way you  approached talking to me time after time after time saying, "i control  you. Or you go home next." I’m said, "no, why--"  i understand.  You realize that's how you came across to me?  You made a choice to go with the girls and not stay with the alliance I’m tried  to make and that's fine. After that I’m gained power winning immunities and I’m  was trying to use this power to manipulate you and your idols.  So, Brad, did you just say you used condescension as a strategy to control Tai?   I didn't say I’m condescend. I’m said, "this is an option i'm giving  you" I’m was simply trying to make a deal, but it came with a price. And  the price was the idol.  Jeff: Debbie, tbhaeg on culpepper's social part of the game.  Well, i've got three brothers. I'm surrounded by people in the military. I’m understand  your testosterone level is 100 times the average male. I’m do get that you  are not the warmest, fuzziest, cuddliest teddy bear. Love you, anyway.  But to be honest, like, this game, this ship, had one driver. And that was Sarah.  Sarah always voted the right way. Because Sarah always knew the right way to  vote. Because Sarah was always directing the right way to vote.  I just want to throw it out there. I’m mean, this is so rich and so  informative and helpful. And my mind is even less made up now in a great way  than when I’m stormed into this tribal council.  Jeff: All right, so, clearly, there are varying opinions about each of you,  in terms of the social part of "Survivor." let's move into the  outplay portion of the same game. You have to make shelter, compete in  challenges, switches and advantages. Anyone have anything they want to say at  the top?  Brad the outplay portion goes to you. You never stopped working. If you  haven't won immunity the last five times, the chances of him sitting there  probably zero. He took a risk playing in a way they respect, and a lot of you  guys will never know what this means because you brutalize your body to get  to this point. I’m failed every single time i've played. I've not been able  to do it. And I’m think that this man, he did it. And I’m think he deserves  to win because he relied on himself when he needed to. We are the authors of  our destiny. We are the authors of our story in this game. And Brad played  hav from the ver beginning to win this game, and that's what he did.  Jeff: Debbie, how much value do you give to camp life and providing? Does it  weigh in on your vote?  To me, "Survivor" has always been "the lord of the  flies." and I’m agree with Ozzy completely. I’m know it's your maek up.  It's your character. It's your very nature to say, "this is what has to  be done." they would not be sitting there without you, sir.  Thank you, thank you, Ozzy, too. Thank you both.  I mean, as far as the outplay, Brad's a professional athlete, people. Oob.  I'm 47. I’m was.  I'm just making a point. He's a professional athlete.  But, the puzzles are not athletic--  let her finish the statement, please.  Here's the thing. I'm not trying to take anything away from Brad at all.  Wening five immiewnts is tough. But what I’m had to rely on was my tools they  had in the outplay department. Sierra tells me in the event she gets voted  out she will will her legacy advantage to me. So now I’m need to get Sierra  out. But how am I’m going to vote her out and still get her to will it to me?  And I’m had to adapt to the situation and act like that. And the day that Cirie  got across that beam was an emotional day for everyone. The game didn't stop,  though. And guess what? Michaela's sitting on the sit-out bench not getting  to play. And at the bottom of her feet I’m seeing in smg. It says,  "secret advantage" on it. Anyone that was there that day had the  opportunity to see that. It wasn't hidden. Paying attention to deTail is how  my playing the game got me right here.  Jeff: Michaela, you were involved in a twist when the advantage was at your  feet that you didn't even really know about.  Yeah, like, it was a great move. And the thing that makes Sarah so bad-ass,  is that she got the advantage from the sit-out bench that I’m was on. If you  are working people so well that you can be so bold as to say, "that was  an advantage that was meant for you, and I’m took it," that's some  bad-as, is stuff. And then to top it off, you used it against me and sent me  home. That was brilliant!  Jeff: Cirie, it's very interesting that we have so many different opinions.  What does that say about all the elements that come in to deciding who wins?  It matters, Jeff, because we have to look at every single aspect, and if you  fell short anywhere, we have to bring it up because we're going to award  somebody a million dollars that's not one of us. We want to make sure that  we're giving it to the right person.  Jeff: So, the game is clearly still alive. Now we're at the outlast portion  of the game. Did you put the people on the jury that respect your outwit, and  your outplay more than the other two? Culpepper, we'll start with you. This  is your last chance to move anybody that you think might not be on your side.   I don't think you have to deceive and lie to every single person to win this  game. I’m came into the game, let people come to me. I’m built relationships  that changed the game at cerTain poants. Got flipped upside down. So at that  point, I’m had to rely on my athleticism or brain. And I’m did just that. So  I’m was able to get to the end, and I’m won the five immunitys. And then as  far as the living and the camp life, I’m don't know that I’m did all that to  get your votes. I’m did all that because that's who I’m am. But anyway, it's  been an honor and a privilege to play with all you guys.  Jeff: Sarah, last chance to sway the jury.  Okay. Here's the thing. You have to strike first in this game. The reason you  guys are there and these two aren't is because I’m truly believe you guys  could have beat me. I’m just hope that you guys can respect the game play and  how hard it was to play with 20 people at such a high-caliber a player, and  be one step ahead every time. Because I’m was the one person here that was in  on every vote. I’m think the history shows that the training and the ability  to adapt to the situations that you're placed in is what saves my life when  i'm at work. And that same training I’m applied out here to save my life in  this game.  Jeff: All right, Troyzan.  I'm just going to keep it light, you guys, and I’m have a pretty good idea where  you stand with me. So I’m might not have been the best strategist. I’m might  not have been the best game player. But I’m want to tell you how much I’m appreciate  all of you for this adventure. You're a part of my dream. I've watched from  season one, you know, when richard hatch was running around naked and people  were eeght rats. And i'm like whatever that is. I’m have to be a part of it.  I’m appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. Really, it means a lot, you  guys. And i'm out. [ applause ]  good job, everybody.  Jeff: All right, a great final tribal. Very healthy discussion. I'm going to  give the jury a moment to take in everything you've heard tonight, and then  you will make a million-dollar decision.  Jeff: All right, jury, tonight, you are voting for a winner. The person you  think most deserving of the title of "sole Survivor" and the  million dollars that goes along with it. For the last time, it is time to  vote. Sierra, you're up.  You played a flawless game, girl. Anybody who doesn't vote for you is a bitter  betty.  I hope that you can do what i've tried to do four times. I’m think you  deserve it.  I am so honored to be voting for you, one of the great masters and great  players of this game. Congratulations, officer Sarah.  Because in this jaded, crazy world, good guys finish first.  Because in this jaded, crazy world, good guys finish first.  Jeff: I'll go get the votes.  Jeff: Culpepper, sara, Troyzan, jury, thank you for a great final tribal. I’m  will see everybody back in the states for the reading of the votes. [ cheers  and applause ]  cochran! [ cheers and applause ]  cochran! [ cheers and applause ]  Jeff: All right! Thank you! Awesome! Have a seat! Let's not waste any time.  Thank you for that nice welcome. So here's its deal. When we had this idea to  do "game changers" we talked about, we thought about who we wanted  to come back. We said we have, truly, one hope. Please let there be some big  moves. That was a genuine hope. You guys delivered so many big moves, you  made history. Thank you for another amazing season of "Survivor." [  cheers and applause ] but now, it comes down to this. After 39 days of  decisions, Brad, Troyzan, Sarah, did you make the right one? The jury, did  you put people on the jury who think you deserve it more than the other two?  I'm going to read the votes. [ cheers and applause ] here we go! First vote, Sarah.  [ cheers and applause ] culpepper. [ applause ].  Jeff: One vote sara, one vote culpepper. Sarah. [ cheers and applause ] two  votes sara, one vote culpepper. Culpepper. We're tied, two votes Sarah, two  votes culpepper. Culpepper. Three votes culpepper, two votes Sarah. Sarah. [  cheers and applause ] we're tied again. Three votes culpepper, three votes Sarah.  Sarah. [ cheers and applause ] that's four votes Sarah, three votes culpepper.  Sarah. [ cheers and applause ] five votes Sarah, three votes culpepper. The  winner of "Survivor: Game changers," Sarah. [ cheers and applause ]   good job. [ cheers and applause ]  good job.  Good job, baby.  Jeff: It was an epic win. You could hear the energy here. Sarah, here's your  check. She's celebrating. You'll take it. All right. We called them  "game changers" and they lived up to it. Historic game play, plus a  moment that had the entire world talking when Zeke was outed as transjerpd.  Live reunion show coming up next. [ applause ]
