<br/>JEFF Probst: The South Pacific. Thousands of islands lay scattered across the world's most beautiful ocean. But for centuries, man has traveled these waters to meet in combat. From brutal tribal warfare to the the epic battles of World War II, this is a  place where rivals have long traveled to settle old scores. It is the perfect setting for our biggest showdown yet. Welcome to the 20th season of Survivor. Over the past ten years, Survivor has traveled to some of the most desolate,  dangerous and exotic places in the world. (bird calling) Over 300 people have tested themselves in the most difficult  and groundbreaking show on television. We have gathered 20 of them to play one more time. These are ten of your favorite heroes... versus ten of the most notorious  villains. <br/>In my world, I've always tried to show that good will win. <br/>I'm a villain. I think villains are smarter than heroes because they don't mind stabbing  somebody in the back to get where they want to get. It's a fact. It's a proven fact. Google it. <br/>The Heroes are definitely people I would rather play the game with. The Villains are the people I've always been against. So this is perfect for me to be on the heroes' side and battle it out against  these punks I don't like anyway. <br/>I've been labeled things like "She-devil in a blue bikini,"  "The wicked witch of the West." "Man-eater Manthey"--  that was my favorite one. (chuckles)  I'm back here to do what I came to do the first time-- get to the end and  make the money. So I'm definitely coming back to redeem myself. <br/>This time, I slay everyone and trust no one. This is my chance for redemption. <br/>I'm not in the shape I was last time, but I still think that I could hang in  there as tough as any guy next to me. <br/>But these people are smart, they'll get rid of me right right away. It's the smartest thing they could do, but they won't. They never do. <br/>I'm almost a decade older than I was the first time. So to me, it's a test to see if I still got it. <br/>Last time I was mean, and this time I'm meaner. You know, I'll lie. I don't care. But I'll make up a good lie. <br/>People think they know me. They really don't know me. (laughing) I'm a gangster in a Oprah suit. But I'm not, like, a mean gangster. I'm a nice gangster with a smile, you know. <br/>Probst: it is still the ultimate challenge: 20 people forced to work together  while battling the elements and each other. They must learn to adapt or they'll be voted out. In the end, only one will remain to claim the million-dollar prize. 39 days, 20 people, one survivor. (theme song playing) *  Flying in the choppers, my heart's beating a mile a minute. I'm sitting right next to Tom and Cirie and all these people. I know the game's going. I'm finally back in the game. <br/>Flying in on the helicopter, you can feel something in the air. There's an electricity. There's a tension. There's a level of excitement that is coursing through everybody's veins,  especially mine. And to start off like that, I think sets a great tone for how the season is  gonna be. <br/>Believe it or not, I'm a little nervous going in. I'm still in awe of who I'm here with. I mean, for God's sake, Boston Rob... Parvati. I mean, you know, I gotta get my mind straight and not let them get me too  starstruck. I'm out here playing a game with them now. <br/>I'm nervous and I'm excited. And, you know, like before you bungee jump or something, you get that knot in  your stomach, and it, like, makes you want to throw up, kind of? That's how I feel right now. <br/>I look over and see my fellow tribemates with the blue buff on getting out of  their copter and running over. It's pretty intense, you know? My tribe, the Heroes tribe, they're hard-working, you know, tough guys, good  people. I was like, you know, "This is it." I can't wait to kick some ass  out here. *  Here we are, we're on our nice little blue mat, and then here come these  Villains, and you see, you see Boston Rob, and he's already got the whole,  the walk and the swagger and the attitude. And then, you know, you see Coach and Jerri. I mean, they really are villains. <br/>Yay! I'm the original villainess of Survivor and I gotta tell you I feel like  Mother Teresa right now with these people. (laughs) It's on. <br/>Probst: All right, let me officially welcome you to Survivor 20: Heroes vs. Villains. (laughter)  Yeah, baby! Whoo! <br/>Probst: Ten years, 20 seasons, over 300 people have played Survivor, the greatest  adventure game in the history of television. Russell, how does it feel to be deemed one of the ten most notorious of all  time? <br/>I'm still in awe that I'm here with... with all these great players. Finally, I can play the game with somebody that respects the game. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob, you proud to be seen as one of the ten biggest villains  of all time? <br/>I'm a villain? (all laughing) Well, it's all in perspective, I guess. It's how you see it. <br/>Probst: Rupert, a lot of people have played this game. <br/>Yup. <br/>Probst: You're still, to this day, one of the most popular. <br/>Uh, it's, it's been an honor since the first time that I got to play. And now when I found out I'm on the Heroes' side, I tell you, I love the  game, and being able to have this chance, it's, it's an honor. <br/>Probst: Tom, another big hero, played a very solid game. A lot of people like you. They were happy you won, which isn't always the case with some of our winners. Stack up these two tribes. <br/>You know, we kind of got maybe some positive energy going just 'cause we've  been labeled the good guys, but, um, I also wouldn't assume that anybody  would stick with the game-play that they had. If it didn't work for them in a previous season, I would say that they might  do a 180 on this thing and spin it around, and I think that could be from  either tribe. <br/>Probst: Colby, in your season, Survivor: Australia, our second season, going  back almost ten years ago, you were so popular, people were naming their  children "Colby." (laughter)  Most of the ones I heard about named their dogs "Colby." (laughter)  So a kid's not bad. I'll take that. <br/>Probst: What's the perspective now, almost ten years later? <br/>It's taken me almost this long to really get enough perspective to appreciate  it, and this is, this is my third time back, and it is, it is humbling. It's the experience and it's the adventure. If you're not fired up at this point riding in on those birds, you don't have  a pulse. <br/>Probst: J.T., is it at all intimidating, even within your own tribe, when you  look around at who's surrounding you? <br/>It's definitely intimidating. I watched these people when I was in high school. I was too young to apply for the show, so I couldn't do it, and now I'm out  here competing against them. And I'm still a rookie out here. I'm probably the youngest one out here. I feel like a young kid against these people, but I'm ready. <br/>Probst: Anybody out here feel they are on the wrong tribe, legitimately feel  they're on the wrong tribe? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>What'd we do? <br/>Yeah, what did we do? <br/>What did we do that was so bad? <br/>Probst: So pretty much every Villain thinks they should be on the Hero tribe. (laughter) Except Jerri Manthey, the original black widow, still owning her  title. <br/>I even got a black hat for this season. <br/>Is there a little symbolism with her hat being black and mine being white? <br/>Probst: Good versus evil? <br/>It was not a mistake. <br/>Probst: Parvati, let's be clear; while you did a great job and were rewarded  with a million dollars, you led one of the most notorious tribe of women ever  in the history of the game. You betrayed people left and right. You guys were responsible for many, many blindsides. Great player? Yes, that's why you're here. Hero? No. James, from your two cents-- Parvati, hero or villain? <br/>Villain. (laughter)  Probst: James is bigger than me. James is right. <br/>I will fight him. I'm not scared of him. (laughs) I don't care how big you are. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Probst: Anybody here willing to say that the sheer size of James does make  them take pause for a moment? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>I don't want to wrestle him. <br/>Hello? <br/>Probst: James, anybody on the Villain tribe intimidate you? <br/>It's the same story every every time. The talkers are the most dangerous. The ones who strategize are the best ones at the game. They-- bar none-- have won most of the series, most of the seasons. <br/>Probst: So you've learned something in your two times out here. <br/>Believe it or not, I have. <br/>Probst: Going back to when you were voted out with two idols, one in each  pocket. (James laughs)  Yes, thanks for reminding me. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob, how big a factor is size versus scrap? <br/>I-I think that we have a huge advantage over them. Our women are clearly stronger than their women. And our guys can hold the best of it. <br/>Yes, yes. <br/>I'm being serious. <br/>You got the gloves, Jeff? <br/>I don't see how they're gonna be able to keep up with us. I love you, Colby, but, man, you got the raw end of the stick. <br/>I'm so glad he's here. I'm so glad Rob's back. <br/>Probst: So, Rob, nobody on this tribe of Heroes intimidates you? <br/>I didn't say that, Jeff. I just said I think that we have the advantage. And we're not gonna be busy dealing with all the egos over there. <br/>Probst: All right, well, we're gonna see how you match up right now. It's time to get to your first reward challenge. Here's how it works: you will square off two-on-two. On my go, both pairs will race out to dig up one bag. Once you have the bag, you must race back to your finish mat. That's where it's gonna get physical. You have four people battling for one bag. To score a point for your tribe, you have to be touching the bag and your  finish mat at the same time. First tribe to score three points wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Well, in addition to the challenges being physical, the conditions  are gonna be demanding as well. Between the heat and the rain, if you do not stay hydrated, you will not last  long. Fire for the winner of the first challenge. Having fire ten minutes into this game gives you a huge advantage going into  that first immunity challenge. You win that challenge, you have momentum, you could ride that all the way to  the end. I know it's worth playing for. I'm gonna give you a minute to strategize on your matchups, then we'll get  started. All right, let's get to our first challenge. The first matchup is going to be Stephenie and Cirie for the Heroes, taking  on Parvati and Danielle for the Villains. This is the lane you're going Right where I am. Just come to me. Survivors ready? Go! There's one bag in this sand. You've got to find it, and you've got to get back to your mat. Danielle and Cirie did this challenge in their season, Exile Island. They're now opponents in the same challenge. Cirie has the bag. Cirie and Parvati going at it. And it's physical quickly. Danielle trying to steal it from Cirie. <br/>Come on, Danielle! Hold onto it, Danielle! <br/>Probst: Stephenie and Danielle now have it. Parvati now has the bag for the for the Villains. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Parvati takes it back from Stephenie, but Stephenie takes Parvati  down. Cirie in on it. Cirie now and Danielle. Cirie is like a linebacker in this challenge. Parvati working Stephenie over. <br/>Come on, Danielle! <br/>Come on, Parvi! <br/>Probst: Danielle has the bag for the Villains! Villains score the first point! Villains lead one-zip. <br/>My shoulder. Wait, wait, wait. <br/>No. We got medic. He's here. <br/>No, no, no. Hold on, hold on. I gotta relax. <br/>Probst: What happened? <br/>If it's out...  What do you want me to do? <br/>I'm a medical student, and when I saw Stephenie dislocate her shoulder, I  knew she could leave the game permanently over something like that. <br/>Probst: You want medical look at it? <br/>What happens if medical looks at it? <br/>Probst: Stay here, stay here. Medical. <br/>Ah! <br/>Hi. <br/>Probst: Her shoulder's popped out. <br/>Yeah, we'll get her down. You can just kneel down for for me? (Stephenie gasping) Hold it up. <br/>Probst: Hold it up? Like that? <br/>Yup. Just need someone to go over there. You're all right. <br/>Probst: Hang tight, okay? (Stephenie gasping) (crunch)  Oh! Okay. <br/>Yay! <br/>The Villains are brutal. They dislocated my shoulder the first challenge. I mean, really? Like, you're already on the Villain tribe, do you have to act like a total,  like, jerk? It's okay now. I just...  Probst: Wow. <br/>All right, guys, let's go. <br/>Probst: All right, we have played our first point of the first challenge of  Survivor 20, and we have our first injury. Stephenie's shoulder had to be popped back into place. Next round is one man, one woman. It's Amanda and J.T. taking on Randy and Jerri. Lane two. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, Jerri! Kick some ass! <br/>Probst: Looking for that bag. then you gotta get back with it. Everybody putting one hand in the sand and one eye on their their opponent. <br/>Randy! <br/>Probst: Jerri's got it. Now, it's a battle to get it up. Jerri found it, but she didn't get it up. Amanda trying to pull Jerri out of there. <br/>Get right on him, Randy! Pull him down! <br/>Probst: Randy and J.T. going at it. <br/>Jerri, get back down! <br/>Probst: Nobody has the bag! <br/>Punch him! Punch him, punch him! <br/>Probst: J.T. has Randy in some kind of a hold. That's some country right there. All that work and the bag is still stuck in the sand. <br/>Jerri, behind you! <br/>Probst: J.T. trying to get to get it. J.T. has the bag! Randy get on him! It's one-on-one! J.T. eludes Randy. We are tied, 1-1. Here we go, next round, it is Colby and Tom taking on Coach and Russell. You're coming to lane nine, the last lane. Survivors ready? <br/>You guys got it, you got it. <br/>Probst: Go! Russell digging for the Villains, Tom and Colby digging for the Heroes. Coach hanging back, just watching. Not gonna let anybody get a free sprint to the finish. A big matchup; four strong guys. Four fit guys. This will not be an easy path to get back to your mat. Whoever gets this point is gonna earn it. <br/>Russell's got it! <br/>Probst: Russell has the bag for the Villains. Tries to toss it to Coach! Doesn't work! Colby now has a hand on it! This is full on. Coach takes Colby over. Colby's trying to push Coach off. Coach not having it. <br/>Hold your bag, Colby! <br/>Get on your feet, Tom! <br/>Probst: Colby inching forward. <br/>Drag him up! <br/>Probst: Russell now trying to get free of Tom. Colby ready to make a move. <br/>Leave his crotch alone, Coach! Okay, Colby! <br/>Come on, Russell! <br/>Probst: Colby now dragging Coach. (Tom groans) Russell really being tough on on Tom. Play fair, down there! <br/>Come on, Tom! <br/>Probst: Colby eyeing that that mat. <br/>Come on, Colby! <br/>Probst: He's just got to make sure coach doesn't drag him to the other mat. <br/>Keep it up, Coach! <br/>Probst: Coach now dragging Colby. Here comes Tom and Russell! Coach scores for the Villains! (Colby gasps)  Colby getting owned by Coach? Oh, my gosh, dude. I can only imagine what Colby's thinking. He's got to be, like, "I may as "well just become a woman,  "because there's no point on "trying to maintain my masculinity  now."  Probst: Villains now lead 2-1. Next round. We are back to women taking on women. It is Sugar and Candice for the Heroes taking on Sandra and Courtney. Lane five. Survivors ready? You're in the right lane. Heroes need to score. All four women are digging and watching at the same time. Trying to find the bag while making sure somebody else doesn't find the bag  while you're looking. <br/>Courtney got it, Sandra! <br/>Probst: Courtney had it. <br/>Sandra, get up! <br/>Probst: Candice is holding on to it. Courtney fighting in there. The smallest woman in this game. <br/>Candice, stand up! <br/>Probst: Candice now trying to get up. <br/>Hold onto her! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! <br/>Probst: Candice standing up but Courtney pulling her back down. <br/>Come on, Courtney! Hold on! You gotta hold on! <br/>Probst: Candice dragging Courtney toward her mat. Sandra has Sugar. <br/>Come on, Sandra! <br/>Go, Sandra! <br/>Probst: Sandra now getting involved. <br/>Probst: Sugar trying to take that bag from Candice. <br/>There you go! <br/>Sugar, get up! <br/>Get up, Candice! <br/>Probst: Sugar has it. The bag is now free! The bag is totally free! Sandra undid Sugar's top. That bag is free, and nobody can get free to get it! Sugar lets go of her top. Sugar takes the bag! Sugar gives up vanity and scores for the Heroes. <br/>Initially, I thought maybe Sandra shouldn't be on the Villain's tribe. Not anymore. Sandra earned her title as a Villain for me with the bra incident and Sugar. <br/>Probst: We are tied: Heroes two, Villains two. Playing to three. This is it. For the Heroes, James and Rupert, taking on Tyson and Boston Rob. This should be a doozy. Come to me right here. Lane eight. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Hey, hold up! Make James work! Stay back! <br/>Stay away from 'em, Rob. <br/>Probst: James digging. Tyson digging. Rupert digging. Boston Rob is just sticking back and watching. Tyson has it for the Villains, but James ties him up before he can even get  it out of the sand. <br/>Good job! <br/>Hey, hold up! <br/>Probst: Rob now going for the bag! <br/>Stay back! <br/>Stay away from 'em, Rob. <br/>Go, Rob! <br/>Probst: Rob and James going at it. <br/>Probst: Rupert ties up Boston Rob. It's James and Rob. Rob tries to take James, can't do it! James scores! Heroes win reward! <br/>When I came out of that final heat, my toe, instead of going up and down,  went like a "J." My toe is broke. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I can feel it. Not that one, this one. <br/>We'll fix you with codeine. (Rupert gasps)  There we go. That's stuck in now. <br/>My toe is broke, and I felt it cracking inside. But I'm not getting put out of this game over a damn toe. First damn day. <br/>Probst: All right, so let's do an injury count. Rupert has a broken toe, Stephenie has a dislocated and then relocated  shoulder. Hopefully, it was worth it. Big victory for the Heroes. Fire. And a map to your new home. Villains, you are definitely living up to your name. Grab your stuff, head to your camp and start working on on shelter. <br/>The Villains lost. You think that really bothers me, losing? 'Cause I'm used to losing with a bunch of dummies. But the difference is this ain't a bunch of dummies. We wil win. And I'm looking forward to sending the Heroes to Tribal Council and letting  them do their hero thing. <br/>Look what we've got here. We've got fins. <br/>Fins, and is there a sling in here, or not? <br/>Fins! <br/>There's a...  Yeah, that's it. <br/>What? <br/>You gotta make your own out of a stick. <br/>Make it. <br/>I can't believe I'm doing this again. It's just starting to sink in. I believe I'm going to have to stay on my toes with these fellas. I'm ready for it. I'm ready for the challenge. <br/>I think that we should live under this tree because it's it's dry. <br/>That's what I'm, that's what I'm thinking. This is, like, the biggest tree right here, right? <br/>I am, yeah, really bad. <br/>Really? <br/>I got about ten bites already. <br/>They like that dragon blood. (laughter)  I got way more to prove right here than I did the last time. If I could do it here, if I can take it all the way, if I can whup these  all-stars, doesn't that mean I'm the best ever? <br/>I'm gonna play similar to the same game. I'm gonna use the mind game. They better give it their all and play the game because I'm taking this crap  serious. That's why I'm here. I have to work my magic on, on the villain side, which is gonna be tough. I'm gonna be straight up with you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, so do I. <br/>I'm an aggressive player. I'm here to win, and, you know, I want to make smart alliances. <br/>The thing is, if we can trust each other and we can do this... which I trust  you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>...which, I trust you. <br/>Yeah, I trust you, too. <br/>You have to trust me. You have to no matter what. <br/>I know. <br/>Because that's the whole name of the game. <br/>I know, I know. <br/>And this is where it happens the first day. This is when it happens. <br/>Sure, I know. <br/>With Russell, he's a great person to play this game with. He knows exactly what he's he's doing. I'm going with my gut and I think that I-I should stick with him until it  gets to a point where I feel like he'd turn on me. <br/>I know. <br/>I'll do whatever it takes to get to the top, but what I'm telling you is...  Yeah. <br/>...is I want to get to the top with you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We are going to be better of a pair than you can even possibly imagine. <br/>I agree. ...period. That's what I really, really want. <br/>And I can swing it. <br/>I clearly know that Russell is running around talking to everyone and telling  everyone the same thing, but we can either work with each other or against  each other, and I do not want to work against him. Are you kidding? He's just an incredible force. <br/>I do. <br/>With Russell, I definitely feel like I am making a deal with the devil, but I  want the devil on my side. <br/>These are all-stars, but you know what? I'm a little above that. Like Michael Jordan is in basketball, like Michael Phelps is in swimming. There's always somebody that's above their sport. And I'm the best player that ever played this game. Now guess what? I get to prove it. (chuckles)  Sweet! <br/>All right! Nice! <br/>Man, we got a net. <br/>Wow! We have a net? <br/>A net! Oh, sweet. <br/>Well, here we are, guys. <br/>Here we are. <br/>Heroes? <br/>We're heroes! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Heroes! (laughter)  "Return, revenge and redemption."  Well...  All right. <br/>Shall we take a celebratory dip? <br/>Yes. <br/>I think so. <br/>It takes a little bit to get back into the rhythm of Survivor and go,  "All right, I "remember this. It's gonna be miserable." A little chillier than you'd think, isn't it? But you just don't remember what it feels like to be stranded and know you're  just at the tip, you're at the beginning of a long journey, if you're lucky. <br/>It's got to be the best first-day challenge I've ever seen in any Survivor. Sugar got topless. (laughter) Stephenie dislocated her shoulder and put it back in, and Rupert  broke one toe in three places. <br/>You know, the challenge, I think our team showed its it's strength. Unfortunately, I didn't. You know, the challenge was rough for me. I don't like losing at anything, and I got beat by Coach. So I'm so rusty on the game, but I'm having a good time. <br/>We're making our first group decision. <br/>Oh, goody! <br/>I mean, we can just build something really quick right now. Yeah, we can always move it. <br/>Um, the two oldest men...  Oh, no, no, no! <br/>can we have, can we...? (laughter) can we just...? <br/>The two older men, could you guys keep your opinions to yourself? <br/>We're all kids, and we don't know anything. So-- what do you guys think? Is it better to have more bugs in the jungle or would it be too cold out here  or can we just build a shelter to block the wind? <br/>I say here. <br/>I say front. All for here? <br/>We'll have a fire. <br/>We can start a fire in the rain. <br/>All right. <br/>Yay! <br/>Wow, this is light. There you go! Get it, girl! <br/>I love my tribe. We have a good aura. We have good energy. You know, we all have a good work ethic. If you just wanna help, like, start putting 'em up, maybe, I guess, right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>We know what needs to be done, and we work together, and I feel really lucky  to be on the Heroes' side and to have the team I have. <br/>I think we should use the big ones, maybe, for the top, higher up, so it  could be more... Like, everything was going right. We have good karma right now. It's great. <br/>You know what we need? Like, the post to split the coconut husk on. You got to get, like, a short, pointy... (chicken clucking) Thought I heard  some clucking, and went around and looked in the bush, and I see some  movement out of the corner of my eye, and here comes a rooster, three hens,  walking right out. Guys, look at this. There are at least three chickens right here. <br/>Chicken? <br/>Stay right here, Tom. I'm gonna go around the other side. <br/>Here's another one right here. <br/>Great, we got four chickens. There's another one. <br/>Yep. <br/>Well, we got three people still, so anybody that can catch a chicken, come  this way. <br/>Go around the back, guys, and draw them out towards us. <br/>Does he have the net? <br/>Yeah, grab that fishing net, would be great. <br/>Bring it up. Everybody who's free should just surround them. Hey, uh... how about if we have four of us go, like, one, two, and then just  throw it out like this? <br/>So, are you ready? <br/>Don't overthrow. <br/>Shh, shh, shh. <br/>Are we gonna throw it on three? <br/>We're gonna throw it on three. <br/>...two... We're just practicing. <br/>...three. <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>No, it's getting away! <br/>Got it, got it! <br/>You got it, man. (chickens clucking) (whooping)  We got ourselves chicken! <br/>Winner, winner, chicken dinner! <br/>Yeah! Winner, winner, chicken dinner! <br/>I have seen my share of chickens, and I've caught my share of 'em, but never  in the wild, and to actually, you know, catch them successfully, all four of  them, that's incredible. <br/>Oh, my God. I don't believe it. <br/>I know. <br/>Oh, my God, you guys! <br/>Nice work. <br/>They are cute, aren't they? Watching these guys working together, I'm ecstatic. Coming back into Survivor, I know the first five days are the hardest time. I haven't hit that wall yet. Maybe in our tribe, we won't. I mean, shoot, we found chickens? We're going to be out of the elements. It's good to be a Hero. <br/>What'd you guys think of the challenge today? <br/>Let's review-- we're glad that Rupert stubbed his toe. <br/>Aargh! (laughter)  The thing is, like, one part of me, like, wants to have sympathy for him, but  another side of me, I almost relished the fact that they got injured. I was like, "Good for them." (laughter)  I definitely had mixed emotions about losing the challenge, because whereas  personally it made a statement, the tribe lost. I had him the whole time. There was not one point in that challenge where I thought he was gonna get  the better of me. <br/>You were very relaxed. I saw it in your face. <br/>Well, there was this sec that he almost took off running and you had to  tackle him down. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We were like, "No!"  Everybody thought that Colby was gonna have his way with me. The tribe was taking about it long after I'd forgotten it, about how I'd gone  out there and basically frog-marched Colby to, uh, to the mat at the end. So it was very fulfilling. And at the very end, dude, I was, like, kind of, like, moved him, moved him,  moved him, mat. <br/>Bam. (laughter)  It was... I enjoyed every second of that. Coach, what a surprise. Honestly, I'm-I'm very surprised by Coach. There's just something about him, and I don't know what it is yet. I'm definitely gonna make it a point to get to know Coach. I know I'm stealing Coach's mantra here, but I'm going into this like a  warrior. 'Cause that's really what you have to do. <br/>How did you know that was my mantra? <br/>Uh, I heard stuff about you. <br/>Yeah, okay. One thing that appeals to me about Jerri is that she's a different kind of  girl, and, uh, that interests me, because I'm a different kind of guy. <br/>Randy, I hear you chuckling over there. <br/>(laughing): No, I'm laughing at Colby's face. Actually, he looked a little scared. ...you don't step away from love. If it's hitting you in the face, you grab ahold to it. You never know, man. <br/>You never know. <br/>You never know. <br/>I would never get in the way of true love. <br/>Go for it, dude. Go for it. <br/>I agree. <br/>Are you talking about Parvati? (laughter)  I have never in a million years would think about coming out on Survivor and  actually being interested in somebody. But Jerri and I, we have a little connection. <br/>How's it going, Coach? I'm keeping my eye on him. <br/>Are you guys playing Cupid? <br/>Yes. You and the dragon slayer. (laughing)  Ooh, I see romance blooming between Jerri and Coach. And Jerri's in total denial, but she totally flirts, and she's, I think, in  spite of herself, a little bit in love with the dragon slayer. <br/>I'm setting you up with Coach. What's the problem? You know what? Love finds you sometimes, and you don't even know it. <br/>Well, you do know that just by cuddling together one night, we created a  whole little...  I know. <br/>...controversial buzz that could potentially not be... I don't know. <br/>Well, I just think we carry on our business. I mean, I think that if we just go about our day and we don't have too many  talks like this, unless we're walking down the beach that way. <br/>I know, right? <br/>But it sucks, because, you know, obviously, I want to talk to you. <br/>I know, I know. <br/>The girls were joking about it. They were, like, "Oh, the black widow and the dragon slayer-- what a  combination." Hey, you never know, we might pair up and run this game. But we need to be careful, Jerri and I, of having the appearance of being in  an unbreakable alliance. <br/>Will you promise me if I should worry about something, let me know? <br/>Well, don't worry about anything. Okay? <br/>Okay. Yeah, 'cause the last... I hate feeling alone out here. <br/>Don't... You're not alone. <br/>It's the worst feeling in the world. <br/>No, you shouldn't be worried. You're with the dragon slayer, man-- don't you worry about that. <br/>We got a good group. <br/>That's what I'm saying. <br/>Here's the thing, this is between me and you right here, it's got to be. But I'm willing to make an alliance right now with you. 'Cause I haven't made an alliance with nobody, brother. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I don't want the physical threat of being thrown out of here. We should never lose, man. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I don't want flower power to be running over this thing like it was, you know. <br/>Hey, I went through it, so...  I know, man. <br/>It was terrible. <br/>James and I, you know, we're buddies right off the bat. We both work hard. He's a guy's guy. I mean, we can talk straight up. Anything he tells me, I believe it. Could I ever beat James if it was me and him in the final two? No. But... I don't see me and him in the final two. I'd rather see us rock on through and stay strong, dude. <br/>Yeah, let's keep the guys together. <br/>If we go to... That's... hey, that's the deal. <br/>No, for real. <br/>I'm gonna form alliances with everyone I can. My strategy is to keep everyone on my side, man. <br/>Here's the thing, Candice... ...for J.T. and James. <br/>I know that James and Amanda played together. <br/>I don't know them, but I know that there's people that, you know...  Yeah. That's my concern. <br/>The first couple of days are always the worst out here. Because you don't have everything settled, you don't know everybody, and so  it's always kind of awkward. <br/>What do you know about Cirie? <br/>You mean, like, how she played the game? <br/>I don't know anything about her. <br/>I don't know her. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Are they friends? <br/>Going into the game again, I'm worried about people who have a history  together, they've played on seasons before together. And I don't really have anyone that I have a solid history with going into  the game. <br/>Well, didn't take long for the game to start. <br/>(laughs): Yeah. <br/>We're back again. <br/>I know. What do you think? <br/>I don't know yet. What do you think? <br/>I don't know, I'm trying to...  Trying to assess the situation. <br/>Yeah. (laughs) Exactly. We can't be off alone like this, though. <br/>James, myself, and Cirie, you know, we've played this game together before. I've played this twice with James-- in China and Micronesia. I've played it once with Cirie, and Cirie and I went to the end together. We were in an alliance the whole time, so we're going to have to watch our  distance, because if people think we're too chummy, it could... it could  definitely play against us. <br/>So, how you doing, my friend? Welcome to Samoa. (laughing)  Thank God we're on the same tribe. <br/>It's good to be here with you again-- yeah, that's great! It's like dÃ    jÃ  vu, right? So, um, hopefully, we can just run this thing where we avoid Tribal Council  in the beginning. <br/>Yeah, but I'm trying to think who... who do you want to get involved with  here. <br/>Right. My closest ally is Stephenie. We played well together in our season in Palau. And, uh, I was thrilled to see her back here on this beach in my tribe. I think Colby... Colby, J.T. and you would be my choice, but like you said, we don't know what they're thinking  is...  That's what I was thinking. <br/>I'm gonna try to work with Stephenie as far as we can, but she might not be  my smartest end player. If I were to get that far in the game and were to face a jury, I want  somebody else who won the million dollars to sit next to me. So, you know, seeing you right away, I will... you know, you want to make  some kind of an oath, whatever. You and I need each other in the finals, because we both won the money. <br/>They have to choose one of us. <br/>If either one of us, no matter how good a game we play, goes up against  someone who didn't win...  We lose. Me and you, man. <br/>It's a good plan. <br/>People are expecting me to be that guy they saw on Tocantins, you know, that  guy who stuck by his word and done everything he had to do. But this game is completely different, because everyone's already seen me  play. <br/>You're my guy for the end. <br/>All right, you got me. <br/>Right. <br/>You know, I need you... and you need me. <br/>We need each other. <br/>To win this game of Survivor, you have to have a dark side somewhere. You have to be willing to sacrifice some of your integrity to make it far in  this game. And I'm not looking to save my hero name. I'm here to do what I have to do to win this game. So it's going to be a whole different ballgame for me. (sighs)  Sandra, do you know how to do this? (laughter)  This is not working. I think I'm not going to do this anymore. <br/>We got ten people here. They don't want to do anything for more than, like, ten minutes at a time. <br/>I know. <br/>But nobody has any energy, because we don't have any water. <br/>Everybody's going to be dead for this challenge if we don't get water. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We have to build a fire. It's been six years since I've played the game, and a lot has changed. Like, there's nobody here that wants to do anything. They don't want to build a shelter. They don't want to try to get a fire going. It's not that they don't know what to do-- they've all played Survivor before. Sandra's won the game. So they know what they're doing. And it's, like, ripping at my every fiber. Ugh! My wife told me, have patience. Amber, I'm trying. <br/>You're-you're just gonna carve a gouge in there and...  A little gouge. Then I'm going to take another piece of bamboo and rub it like this. <br/>You know, nobody's going to get voted out for not making fire, and nobody's  going to get to stay...  If they do. <br/>...trying to make fire. So why don't we blow it off? <br/>Do you think? (laughs) You're just going to wear yourself out. <br/>You know, I played this game before, and if you don't have flint and steel,  you can't make fire. Not by rubbing two sticks together. This game lasts 39 days. I think we'll get fire by the end of 39 days. <br/>Now, slow, short strokes at first. A little faster, guys. <br/>Starting to get some smoke. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Keep going. All right, real fast now. <br/>Here we go! (loud grunting)  Three, two, one. Do it. <br/>Flames. <br/>It's happening. <br/>This is happening. <br/>Rob, you're the man down here, too. None of us are gonna do anything. You're in charge. <br/>Here we go. <br/>Here we go. (excited shouts)  Oh, yeah! Unbelievable! <br/>I'm still the same guy I was the first time I played this game-- that  competitiveness, that cutthroat-ness, that's me. At the same time, a lot has happened with me personally in my life in the six  years since I've played this game last. You know, I got married, I had a kid, I'm learning compromise and patience. But look at these people, you know? Not the brightest bulbs, and I'm here trying to make the most of it, trying  to make it work. <br/>We got fire! (excited shouts)  Look at it! <br/>Wow! <br/>Beautiful! <br/>Amazing! <br/>I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it. <br/>(laughs): I know, man. <br/>Now, I got to tell you, I'm a little in awe of Rob, and I'm not like that  with people. You know, he's played it twice. He's intuitive and ingenious and very smart. So that's great. I mean, he's a great guy to have on the tribe. You are the man. And it's, like, when you're talking, I'm just, like... I'm, like, literally  hanging on every word. <br/>I appreciate it, I do. <br/>I'm serious. I'm, like, hanging on every word. <br/>We made fire, and now Coach is going off with Boston Rob like he's a hero or  something. <br/>I'm bromancing on my idol, what can I say? <br/>Rob, he thinks he's the boss of the camp. He thinks he's in control. But this is my mountain, and I'm still the king of the hill. Survivor is my palace. So I'm still the king, unless I'm dethroned. And you know what? That ain't gonna happen. <br/>Probst: Coming up on this special two-hour season premiere of Survivor:  Heroes vs. Villains:  We have to divide them. <br/>Probst: Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, Heroes! <br/>Probst: Coach leading the tribe of Villains, using all of that life  experience in a kayak. <br/>It's only a matter of time before that tribe self-destructs. <br/>It's time to cut his throat. <br/>Being able to get out in the ocean, that's where I feel most comfortable. But my toe is broken at least two places. And I haven't caught a darn fish yet. I think it'd be better off for me right now, especially with my darn toe, to  be a worker bee. I'm going to start us a fire. You can do this. Just start the damn fire. (whispers): Gosh darn it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, you can do this. <br/>Rupert the fire maker. (laughing): He shaved half the magnesium off the flint, you know, and still  couldn't get the fire. You don't want to say anything. You just sit there and watch, because his ego is so humongous. What can you say? <br/>Yeah, I'll tell you why I can't, Rupe. <br/>You want to go ahead, but, uh, I've been sitting here for a while, and...  we've had some hellacious piles of magnesium. God! It's okay. It's a state of mind. Making fire is as much a state of mind as anything. (birds chirping)  Wow, that's looking... Now we're talking. <br/>Yay. The only thing that I'm worried about is my darn broken toe. If it starts coming up more and more about how much pain I'm really in and  what I really can bring to this tribe-- because I haven't done a whole lot  yet-- that worries me. Wow. Good for you guys. *  You just scoot up. Tyson and I decided we wanted to try to climb this coconut tree to get the  palm fronds off. Think it's a little too dangerous? <br/>It's pretty precarious... with the wind. <br/>The wind is blowing up there now. <br/>Get down. <br/>She's, like, "Why'd you let him do that?" If he breaks his leg. <br/>He's a father. <br/>Yeah, I was told not to do anything stupid. You go ahead and try. I could probably get up there and get them, but why would I risk falling and  getting hurt? Man, it's higher than it looks. But I know somebody that, you know, is so full of themself, when you give  them a challenge, they're just going to have to do it because they're the  greatest and the best, and you know, every day out here they get stronger. <br/>He wants to be a Hero, but he's really a Villain, so we'll see how this goes. <br/>I say don't do it. <br/>Get your ass up that tree, will ya? <br/>Boston Rob and I do have a good time together, you know? I like talking to him, because he's really-- he's sharp, and I like that, and  he's gonna challenge me, and I think I'm gonna challenge him. I think I need somebody that's able to sharpen me, as iron sharpens iron. <br/>Come on, you can do it. <br/>Oh, at least he'll land in the water. <br/>You want to make a bet? <br/>What? <br/>If he makes it or not? I'll bet you a dollar. <br/>The person that I think I'm most like is Boston Rob. Seeing Rob here, it reminds me of when he played the first time-- I loved him. Okay. <br/>All right? <br/>All right, a dollar. A dollar that he won't make it to the top, and you're saying a dollar that  he'll do it? <br/>He's going to do it. <br/>That's someone I could see myself aligning with until it's time to cut his  throat. <br/>I bet on you! <br/>What? <br/>I bet that you would make it. <br/>I bet that you'd fall in the water. <br/>Oh, he's giving up! Oh, no, he's giving up! <br/>You're not a warrior! Get up there! <br/>Get back down, get back down. <br/>Man! <br/>Right to Sandra, winner, from... from Boston Bob the loser. <br/>Boston Bob. <br/>So I bowed out, swallowed my pride. It's not worth it. Tucked my tail, went back down. <br/>Man, you cost me. <br/>I won. <br/>I made a bet and I lost. <br/>I could have probably made it up to that where it starts getting steep. <br/>Coulda, shoulda, woulda, didn't. <br/>But it's not worth it. Could I make it up there? Yes. But if I fall off, I mean, why risk that? <br/>From the Hero to the zero. <br/>From the Hero to the zero? <br/>Yep. <br/>He was a Hero...  From the Villain to the never was. *  This game, it's a reflection of your life, and you don't even realize it. I guess in life I always need a protector of some sort, and especially in the  game of Survivor. So now I'm starting to realize that I've got these sexy young men on my tribe. What's going on over there, Colby? <br/>It was night two. People are starting to fade off and get some much-needed rest. That's what we have to have to stay strong and compete. <br/>Is that a satellite or a shooting star? <br/>And Sugar, she just starts chatting up again, and not whispering but chatting  up loud. <br/>You guys are all spooning. I don't want to spoon, I want to... (laughs)  And then you could start to feel and see everyone kind of wrestle awake. I couldn't even roll over without her rolling over and putting her arms  around me, or then when I would just lay there still like I was in a coffin,  she'd grab my hands and put them on her. I'm being flirted with, and I'm just not interested. <br/>Should we go back to that corner? Let's go. Go in the corner where we were. <br/>She chased me all around the shelter. Wherever I'd go, two seconds later, she'd show up there. She's becoming a bit annoying. Nobody really had a good night's sleep because of her. If you ruffle the feathers of the tribe... (whistles) they'll get rid of you  in a hurry. <br/>Has everybody talked about what they want to eat tonight? We gotta have boiled eggs, don't you think? <br/>Chicken. <br/>You want a chicken? <br/>First challenge? <br/>No, heck, yeah. <br/>And he's the biggest, too, so...  Yep. <br/>We're thinking of maybe cooking a rooster, depending on how much fish we get. <br/>There are some parallels in how you decide which chicken to eat in the same  way you devour your enemies in the game of Survivor. If they're producing eggs, they'll probably stay around camp for a long time. If they're not, they're going to start hitting the barbecue. <br/>Anybody want to do the honor or do you want me to go ahead? <br/>You do it. <br/>Go ahead. (indistinct chatter, laughing)  Oh. <br/>Yeah, J.T., he did it old school. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>He just grabbed it by its neck and spun it around until it was done. <br/>Wow, you are so country. <br/>My great-great grandmother did that to me one time when I was three and  scared the life out of me. She took one and grabbed it by its neck and spun it around and and popped its  head off and then it run around. It was traumatic-- like, we were screaming. We didn't know what to do. And I don't know, it was a good time. Kind of... kind of very... it was traumatic. But it was... it's funny now. It smells good. I can smell it already. <br/>Mmm! <br/>It's pretty good. <br/>It is good. Yeah. <br/>You know, it's little victories like the chicken that get you fired up. It just goes to show we have sustainability out here. That's a huge thing. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thanks for cooking, boys. <br/>I think the Villains can stay positive for a short time. But without fire, without the small victories, it's only a matter of time  before that tribe self-destructs. <br/>We're living large on Hero Beach, James. It's good to be a Hero. <br/>Treemail! <br/>"This challenge is a big one. It's not for the stupid or weak. You've been here before, so save your excuses at Tribal Council. Feel free to speak. Life's tough enough on the island, with suffering hunger and thirst, so don't  add to the humiliation by being the one who is voted off first." Ooh...  The Villains were beaten the other day but not broken. Today, we build ourselves up again to go out there and to thrash the Heroes  unmercifully. <br/>Today is the difference maker in the whole game. We gotta win. <br/>Hopefully, we will not only defeat them, but we will beat them as well,  mentally, and... turn things around for the better. <br/>Villains! <br/>Get your evil on! <br/>I got my evil right here. <br/>Yeah. <br/>JEFF Probst: Come on in, guys! So, Heroes, you guys had fire. J.T., how's it going? Were you able to get fire going? <br/>Yeah, it's been pretty good, actually. We're staying a lot drier than I expected. <br/>Our roof is pretty thatched pretty well so we kept dry. <br/>Probst: Tom, how's the food? <br/>Food's going pretty good. We got lucky with a couple of-- one rooster, three hens, had a nice breakfast  today. <br/>Probst: Rob, what's going on over at the Villains' camp? <br/>Yeah, it's not quite as good as the way they're talking over there. Our shelter is terrible. <br/>Well, it's not that bad. <br/>It's terrible. It's terrible. <br/>It's bad. It's really bad. <br/>Probst: And therein lies the difference between Coach, who can endure  anything, and the rest of us who would like something to lie down on. All right, you guys ready to get to your first immunity challenge? <br/>Do it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right, for today's challenge, six tribe members will race to  assemble a boat. You must then use seven planks to keep the boat together. You'll paddle out, grab a torch, paddle back, where you will remove the seven  planks and bring them back to the start. The four remaining tribe members must then solve a puzzle. Once you have the puzzle completed, you will use those planks to build a  ladder to allow you to place the puzzle in its appropriate spot. It's then a race to the top. First tribe to get all their members to the top, light their fire barrel,  wins immunity. This is what you want in this game. If you have immunity, you are safe. You can't be voted out. Without it, you are vulnerable. Losing tribe goes to Tribal Council where somebody will be the first person  voted out of Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains. One item of note-- both Candice and Parvati have both competed in this  challenge in their original season. In the Cook Islands they were on the same tribe. They were winners. Today they are opponents. See how it plays out. I'll give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right, here we go. At stake, immunity, and for the Villains, fire if they win. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, Heroes! <br/>Come on, Villains. Get ugly! <br/>Probst: You need all the pieces. You need the planks. You need your paddles. You need all of it. Both tribes doing a good job of getting all their pieces out in the water to  start putting this boat together. James carrying two by himself. <br/>That goes here...  Hold that. <br/>Let's go, guys. Hey, let's go. We've got to put these together. <br/>Let's go, Heroes! <br/>Great job, guys. <br/>Probst: Heroes getting it together quickly. Villains already falling behind. <br/>One small hole. <br/>That one there? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Got to get those planks in. That's what's keeping your boat together. <br/>That doesn't fit. <br/>Probst: Parvati, Coach, Tyson, Courtney, Russell and Danielle struggling  early. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Everything strapped. <br/>Probst: Heroes have their boat together and they're heading out. <br/>Yeah, Heroes! <br/>Keep it up! <br/>Probst: Heroes with a nice lead right off the bat. <br/>You guys, put it together. Put it together. <br/>Probst: Heroes doing a good job. Everybody working together. <br/>I need three holes close together over here. <br/>Three holes close together, could be four-- no...  Probst: Villains starting to panic a little seeing that lead increase. <br/>They're not even off the beach. Now, let's just cruise up on it. <br/>Probst: Heroes are already at their fire. J.T. has the torch. Heroes are now heading back. Villains finally have their boat together. They're heading out. Heroes look like they've been paddling together forever. Great rhythm. Everybody working together well. <br/>Good lead, guys! Yeah! <br/>I hate them so bad. <br/>Probst: Coach leading the tribe of Villains using all of that life experience  in a kayak. <br/>Got it. <br/>Probst: Villains have their torch. Parvati lights it. Villains are now heading back. <br/>Only on the right. And stroke, stroke. <br/>Let's go, come on, guys! <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Pull it, pull it, pull it! <br/>Run it in! Run it in! <br/>Probst: You now have to take that boat apart. You need those seven planks. <br/>Let's go get those planks off! You're doing great. <br/>Probst: Once you can get those planks off, take them and get up there. Heroes have their planks. They're heading up to the puzzle. <br/>Good job, guys! <br/>Good job! <br/>Probst: Got to get your planks here before you can start on your puzzle. Heroes now with an early lead. Working on this puzzle. Villains, you need to pick it up. <br/>Stroke! Stroke! <br/>Take your time. Don't panic. <br/>Probst: This is a four-layer puzzle. In our 20th season of Survivor, you can expect difficult challenges and  difficult puzzles. <br/>Get out, get out. <br/>Probst: Villains are back. Get those seven planks and get back here. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Wait, wait, that's not right. <br/>Got it. <br/>Probst: Villains heading back with their seven planks. <br/>Come on, come on, come on! <br/>Probst: Start! Villains now working on their puzzle. Villains hoping to make up some time. Rob, Sandra, Randy, Jerri working on the puzzle for the Villains. <br/>Wait, there it is. That's it, that's it. <br/>Probst: It's Amanda, Cirie, Sugar, and Rupert working for the Heroes. The question is, did you pick the right four to put the puzzle together? <br/>Something has to go down here. <br/>This is here. <br/>Come on, guys. You got it. <br/>Probst: Rob and Sandra doing a great job on the puzzle. <br/>I don't think this goes here. Something's not right. Something has to go here, you guys. <br/>Probst: As Amanda and Cirie start to panic. Rupert now getting in it for the Heroes, trying to get something going. Heroes had a big lead and it is all but gone. Sandra and Rob working together very well. <br/>You guys are doing a good job. Come on, guys, you got it. <br/>That goes there. <br/>Probst: Sandra feeling very confident. Heroes not confident at all. Sugar watching it fall apart. And the Heroes are back to the start. All the pieces out, they are starting over. Villains are now in the lead in this challenge. Only five pieces left. Are they right? Heroes still trying to figure out the first piece of this puzzle. <br/>Maybe there are two different pieces that fit into the same thing. Sugar now getting involved. Villains getting very close. Do they have it? They do! Villains have their puzzle completed. Villains have their puzzle put together. Now they have to put the seven planks in the right spot to build a ladder. Heroes, you need to keep it going. <br/>This stuff goes underneath it. <br/>Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait. <br/>Probst: Villains with a big come-from-behind. Villains have their ladder built. Got to put the puzzle in. <br/>Watch your hands. <br/>Probst: It's in. Everybody to the top. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Probst: It started as blowout for the Heroes. It is ending as a blowout for the Villains. <br/>Light it up, light it up, light it up! <br/>Probst: Villains win first immunity challenge! <br/>Yeah, baby! Good job, good job! <br/>Man! <br/>Probst: Villains, congratulations. Immunity keeps you safe from Tribal Council. Fire will hopefully get your camp in order. <br/>Yes! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Sugar, three days into this game, right on cue, you're crying. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right, Heroes. Tribal Council tonight. One of the ten of you will be the first person voted out of Survivor: Heroes  vs. Villains. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. Villains, congratulations. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>Thank you. <br/>If Sugar's having some sort of emotional breakdown on day three, she's not  fit to be out here another 36 days. Losing her, we're going to miss... Yeah, I don't think we're going to miss  much. <br/>Yeah, how do you like us now, huh? <br/>Yeah! <br/>All right! <br/>Good job. <br/>Good work. <br/>Now, we have a relaxing afternoon. Nobody has to go cut anybody's throat. We just have a nice nice, huh? <br/>It was exciting to win the immunity challenge. We had to do it because we didn't want one of our people to be the first to  leave Heroes vs. Villains. Now we're trying to figure out who they're going to send home and why. <br/>Well, Tom and Stephenie are together. They were together from before. James has to be with Cirie and Amanda and what's the other one? When push comes to shove and nobody wants to go home first, it's about who  all you've been with and who you know. <br/>Yeah. <br/>What I like about it is they all shook up now. Now they are divided. We have to divide them. The Heroes got their asses handed to them. And, you know what, we were having a good time just sitting back loving it. Oh, I'm happy! <br/>Keep going, keep going. <br/>It strengthens our tribe and it weakens the Heroes' tribe. <br/>We looked like a team a little bit today. Like eight out of ten, 80%...  A solid B-plus. <br/>They got to stab somebody in the back. They're over there being villains. That's what they're doing. <br/>This is not good. Nobody in a million years would have guessed we are going to Tribal Council  on day three. Hopefully, this loss does nothing to our momentum other than show us that  we're vulnerable. They might be a little more sneaky and a little more game playey and a little  more damn puzzle oriented, and that's fine. <br/>Well, they wanted it pretty bad. <br/>They needed it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And we were a little cocky. We walked in there like the heroes. You know, there's big "S's" on all of our chests. This Heroes vs. Villains is going to be a tough one. When we thought we had it in the bag, they showed us we don't. <br/>You guys want some coconuts? <br/>Neither was I. <br/>What do you think? <br/>Amanda? <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay, we all...? Well, that's fine with me. As long as it's not me. <br/>It's freaking awesome with me. Please. <br/>Okay. <br/>When we lost, I felt really, really awful. I helped us lose, I guess, because I was on the puzzle, and I felt bad  because we had such a good lead before. I just was disappointed in myself. And scared. I don't want to talk to anyone. <br/>Me, either. <br/>I'm so depressed right now. (laughing) These are all people, some of them have all played together  before, and they're really good. And I think that Amanda and James are together, so we have to break that up,  if at all possible. <br/>This isn't a bad thing. <br/>No. <br/>I think Sugar. I think everyone's thinking Sugar. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Is that done? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah? <br/>Yeah. <br/>What are you thinking? <br/>I'm thinking that you have a follower and you got one of the smartest  strategic players in the game. Why are we taking out the follower instead of the strategic player? Cirie...  Oh, Cirie? <br/>...has run this game a few times. So... I really believe that when you identify a threat, you take them out as  soon as possible. You don't wait. People did that on my season, and they waited too long, and then they didn't  get the opportunity to get rid of me. So I don't want to have those regrets that those people had. <br/>I have no problem. <br/>Just a thought. Just a thought. <br/>I'm down with that. <br/>Cirie is just a brilliant strategist in the game. She's proven that, so I'm just a little nervous to give her a bye tonight. <br/>So I told you three my concerns about Cirie. <br/>Cirie-- I worry about her the most. <br/>Right. <br/>Cirie's tricky. <br/>So, who are we voting for? That's what I'm...  I like Sugar...  They're voting for Sugar? <br/>Who's voting for Sugar? <br/>The other group. <br/>Do we need to break up Tom and Stephenie? <br/>I agree. Because why waste a vote? And you're not going to be able to get him later. So, what are we doing? Tom? <br/>Tom or Stephenie. I'm good with either one. <br/>You got to make a decision which one before we go back, 'cause we're not  going to be able to talk again. <br/>Word on the street is, Sugar is supposed to go tonight. Why Sugar? Sugar, yes, she's annoying, which is even a better reason for me to keep her  around, because as long as there's somebody annoying and somebody... less  strong than I am, then that takes the target off of me. So if we could get one of the stronger players out, like Tom or Stephenie,  that would be better for me. So I'd rather not have Sugar go tonight. My concern is, if we don't knock one of them out, like Stephenie, who ca...  We're going to lose challenges without Stephenie? <br/>Maybe. She's a really strong swimmer. <br/>And can't-- and Sugar is not? <br/>I don't think so. <br/>I don't know. I'm just... you know...  There is an advantage of keeping Stephenie right now and getting rid of  Sugar, physically, like, for the challenges. But strategically, Stephenie has got game and she has to go. You think Stephenie? <br/>The smartest... the smartest move right now would be Stephenie. I mean, think about it. We want to make moves that's gonna guarantee us, you know, getting further in  this game. <br/>It's so hard, because you want to keep your team strong, but strategically,  you have to put yourself in a good position. Either you're doing it for challenges, or you're going to get rid of someone  for strategic reasons. Or you just don't like them. Cirie and I are here for blood, okay? We are here to win this thing. * *  Probst: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch. Approach a flame, dip it in, and get fire. This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council, because in this game, as you  know, fire represents your life. As long as you have fire, you're still in the game. When your fire is gone, so are you. That will be the case for one of you tonight. First, let me just welcome you to Tribal. We're 40 feet in the air in the middle of the jungle, no roof. If it rains, we will get wet. As I'm sure will happen once or twice out here. I just want to look at some of the reasons you might vote somebody off. Tom, how big a factor do you think prior relationships-- you and Stephenie,  Amanda and Cirie, people that have played together before that others might  look at and think: they've got to be friends, they got to be in an alliance,  they know each other? <br/>I think that we all worried about that coming into it. I think it's kind of been pushed to the side now. We realize that you just got to give everybody a clean slate and take it from  there. So, I'm not too worried about the previous relationships. <br/>Probst: Sugar, you haven't played with anybody. Do you buy what Tom's saying? Is it fine, it's a clean slate? "I don't really care if they knew somebody else before."  Well, I thought that was a really good speech, but I do think that that is definitely  a factor-- people who have played together and people who knew each other and  people who hang out, or whatever. <br/>Probst: What about past success? Amanda, you've played twice, and you've made it to the end both times. Do you find yourself already trying to deflect some of the attention that  might be on you? <br/>You know, one thing that I did do in both my seasons to get to the end was  make loyal alliances. So I think in a way it's a positive thing for me. And, yeah, I haven't won. Like, obviously, we all know, I'm not good at Tribal Council. <br/>Yeah, that was the best Tribal Council question you've ever answered. <br/>See? I'm working on it. <br/>You answered that really correctly. I'm surprised. I'd say it out loud. <br/>Shut up, James. <br/>That was the best. <br/>Probst: You're surprised and I'm excited. <br/>Obviously. <br/>It took me a while, but I'm getting the hang of it. So, yeah, it's both. I mean, there's people in this game that have won. I mean, come on, you know. <br/>Probst: Cirie, you're the woman that stayed at home and watched Survivor on  the couch. And now here you are for the third time-- yet another reason to get rid of  somebody. She's grown into a bona fide threat to win the game. How do you defend that, first Tribal Council? <br/>Well, like you said, Jeff, everybody here is a threat. If they weren't threatening, they wouldn't be here. <br/>Probst: Steph, that's really what we're getting at, at this first Tribal  Council. Is there's a reason to get rid of every single person up here. <br/>Well, I think, as far as trying to make a decision tonight, it's the first  one, and that's the hardest, I think. But we don't want to come back here. I mean, what I'm doing is I'm going to go with who I think is the weakest for  the team right now. And will help us stay the strongest we can to continue to win. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about today's challenge. James, first half of the challenge, you guys smoked them by a long ways. Then we got to the puzzle. Amanda, Sugar, Cirie, Rupert-- disaster. <br/>It's sucked because nobody was focusing. Everybody had their own opinion. It was like everybody wanted to solve the puzzle differently. But hopefully, they'll focus next time because this just can't happen no more. <br/>Probst: Cirie, if it's you tonight, is it fair to take it because you were  one of the people that blew it on the puzzle? <br/>I don't think one challenge should determine your worth in the long run of  this game. It could have been Tom and Stephenie, and they could have lost the puzzle. <br/>Probst: Sugar, you were one of the four people that blew it on the puzzle. <br/>I know. <br/>Probst: There's no debate about that. Would it be fair to say "Voting Sugar out"? <br/>Well, that's why I was crying. <br/>Probst: Because you're afraid that might be the reason? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Would that be criteria enough for you to get rid of somebody? <br/>No, not me. I wouldn't vote somebody out just because they were part of a team that  didn't win the challenge. <br/>Probst: Candice, you got to vote somebody out. Does it make it easier for you to say "Well, I could just simply blame  it on the puzzle"? <br/>I think the people who stepped up to do the puzzle were pretty brave, so I  think we should appreciate that they stepped up to do that and not start  voting people out for that because otherwise nobody is ever going to do a  puzzle. <br/>Probst: Tom, do you vote tonight based on long-term game or short-term game? <br/>I think that people are developing their relationships, and kind of everyone  is always looking towards the endgame, but that's not what we're working on  now. We're working on staying strong with your best people, and let's not come  back here anymore and we don't have to worry about who we're voting out. <br/>Probst: Candice, a lot of these people know each other. Is the first Tribal Council maybe an opportunity to take one person out of  the equation and really change things up? <br/>I think the first Tribal Council is an opportunity to do anything. We've got ten people here, and there's a lot of different ideas going around. So, yes... Or no. (laughter)  Probst: All right, well, clearly there's a legitimate reason to vote every  single person out. The only thing left to do is find out who that person is going to be. It is time to vote. Candice, you're up. * (thunder rumbling)  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Sugar. Sugar. Two votes Sugar. Sugar. That's three votes Sugar. Sugar. That's four votes Sugar. Amanda. Four votes Sugar, one vote Amanda. That's five votes Sugar, one vote Amanda. First person voted out of Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains-- Sugar. <br/>Okay. One of you all better win. <br/>Probst: Sugar, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Bye. <br/>Probst: All right, first person voted out of this game, a Hero. After you get back to camp and get your fire going, should be one thing on  your mind-- getting even. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Try to stay dry. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:  Rob? Rob. Uh-oh. <br/>Can open your eyes for us? <br/>Probst: Rob, can you hear me? <br/>It's not a great feeling to be the first person voted off. I was crying today because I'm dramatic and I felt like I lost the game for  everybody. And I think they did probably make the right decision in voting me out  because I am I'd say the weakest link, although I give it my all. But I can't wait to get some clothes on.
