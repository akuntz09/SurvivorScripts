<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: Both tribes were hammered hard by wind  and rain. <br/>I have never in my life been this cold, had my hands this destroyed, and my  feet look so miserable. We're freezing. <br/>Probst: But with their huge lead in numbers and rewards--  That looks so good. <br/>Probst: Galu still had plenty of reason to celebrate. <br/>After I finish this, I'll take the whole team by myself. <br/>Probst: The only storm Galu couldn't weather was Shambo. <br/>Escaped chicken, escaped chicken. 9-1-1. <br/>Shambo is just a complete Gilligan who just messes things up all the time. <br/>Probst: On her second visit to the Foa Foa tribe, it became clear these were  Shambo's real friends. <br/>I am really, really happy to be over here with Foa Foa. <br/>Probst: Russell, on the other hand, had no friends, only targets. <br/>Marisa threatened me, Betsy threatened me-- each time somebody threatened me,  they're going home. <br/>Probst: and when Liz confronted Russell. <br/>You are lying to me. <br/>I'm telling you the truth. Are you telling me I'm not honest? <br/>Probst: She became next on his hit list. But after Liz's strong effort in another loss-- Galu wins immunity. Russell put his vendetta against her on the back burner in order to jettison  the tribe's weakest member, Ashley. <br/>It's because of me you're going home. I'm out here playing for $1 million. Never trust me. <br/>Probst: With only five Foa Foa left, Liz needs a miracle to save herself from  Russell's cruel intentions, assuming they can all survive the conditions. 14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? (thunder crashing)  Are you shaking? <br/>Yeah. <br/>You're that cold? I mean, I'm cold, too, but geez. <br/>okay, Mick's having a seizure over here. He's epileptic. <br/>Since day ten, this is day 15 now, we're getting soaked at night. It's cold. So, it's been pretty bad for the last several nights. I'll be honest, like there was some envy last night when Ashley went home. There was a little tinge of jealousy there. I was like, "Oh, man," you know? <br/>I really think we got another two days of this, three days, something. <br/>I used to watch this cartoon when I was growing up called Captain Planet, and  there was always that one guy with the ring, heart, and we always make fun of  him. Like, "What is heart?" Everybody else gets a real element and you  get heart." And I really wish I had that heart ring right now. Because I'm tired, I'm really hungry, and I'm sitting here trying to battle  what seems to be a battle that fate just doesn't want us to win. What do you think? Yeah. <br/>It's not bad. <br/>It's not bad. <br/>This is the man test. <br/>If it takes seven days and seven nights of rain for one person to quit, I'll  take it. Hell, yeah, I'm having fun. I'm out in the rain. This is how I want it to be. That sunny days we had for nine days, I was like, "Man, this is too  pretty. I'd take my family here." I want to be somewhere where I can't take my  family, where it's miserable. <br/>(laughing)  What's wrong, man? <br/>I'm so freaking cold right now, it's ridiculous. <br/>So silly. <br/>I'm freezing! <br/>Come on, man. You can take this. It's just a little water. Man. <br/>This isn't even right. <br/>They're going to be soaking wet, whether it stops raining or not stops  raining. Tonight, they're going to be wet, so this is really no big deal. As a matter of fact, this makes me stronger. (theme song playing) (thunder rumbling) (thunder crashing)  A what? <br/>It's raining. People are miserable. Spirits are down. And it could all be alleviated had Russell gotten us that tarp. But it's just the way the game goes sometimes. You know, one person is elected to make decisions for the group. Sometimes, it puts you in a worse position than you would have been if you  were making those decisions for yourself. (thunder crashing)  Welcome to Samoa, brother. Rain doesn't stop. Russell's an animal. <br/>Where is he? <br/>Right there. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Russell was out working on the fire while every single one of us was huddled  up trying to stay warm, just trying to keep sane, and he's out there just  busting his butt. For me to see that, you know, it's awesome to see him push himself, but,  also, like, you know, it's great that you're out there doing it, but at the  same time, it's like, no one expects you to do that. You know, it might have been to a point where it was a bit unnecessary and  went a little bit too far. <br/>You know what? There's no reason to be sitting out here right now. <br/>I'd rather be in the shelter, but sometimes you have to make some deposits in  case you need any withdrawals later on. You know, the chief thing counter-balances to the negative, so just trying to  keep the fire burning. This is buying stock low. Hopefully I'll be able to sell high later. <br/>Fire looks good though, huh? <br/>I just got a chill. Hold on. <br/>Careful, careful, careful! <br/>Are you okay? <br/>Just hand me my jacket. Just hand me my jacket. <br/>Here you go. <br/>Goodness! Oh, that sucked. That sucked. <br/>Russell's definitely got this, like, stubborn determination to do everything. But truth is, like, the elements out here, like, it's going to break you down. He's just pushing himself too hard and it's going to take its toll, you know. <br/>I can go back out there. I just got to get my body temperature back up. (thunder crashing)  I probably look like some crazy person, but basically, this spot actually is  a pretty good cover. I can kind of-- with my body heat, kind of keep this corner a little bit warm. The shelter has so many gaps in it, that when it rains this hard, it just  pours right through. I can't wear my clothes because they're all soaking wet. So I'm just doing the best I can at just trying to stay semi-warm and out of  the rain and... Just trying to get through this. <br/>It's wet. They don't want to get out. Where are they all from, New York City? "Got to stay dry. Can't get my hair wet." Man, this is crazy. <br/>You never know, man, they might also sucking each other's thumbs because  they're just a bunch of babies. That's why we lose the challenges because they're lazy. They give up. They start walking, they start, "I'm too tired." Don't stop until  you throw up, you pass out, something. If you don't throw up after every frickin' challenge, you didn't do your job. That's how I think of it. Now, it was freezing last night, wet, cold. It's time to do something about it today, but they don't want to. They want to sit there and suck on their thumbs. So I don't know how to help them. I don't think it's going to stop raining. (thunder rumbling)  (groans) I had been in my hole for, you know, almost 26 straight hours of  rain, and I was laying in the hole and I was, like, "Okay, I give in. We give in. We understand your greatness. We understand your power. And if you are kind to us, I promise we will speak of your mercy." And  less than 12 hours later, I wake up from my hole, and not only is it blue  skies, but the most beautiful rainbow you have ever seen. It's as if Samoa said, "That's all I wanted to hear, Erik. Just know I'm the man, you're not. Now that we got that clear, enjoy yourself for the next 24 days." I'm so  happy. <br/>That's a nice sign, isn't it? <br/>That's a real nice sign. I don't think they have a rainbow on Foa Foa's side of the island. <br/>A rainbow. That is really, really nice to wake up to. I mean, getting a ray of sunshine today was like-- you talk about lifting  spirits. You know, winning challenges and rewards-- nothing beat this morning. <br/>Look at that! <br/>I feel like we just got off of Noah's Ark. <br/>There actually is a sky out there other than just clouds. Can you believe it? Look! There's blue sky out there! I think going through a storm like this, I think it definitely brings the  tribe together, 'cause we weathered it all together. Now that we're out, we know we've got a task at hand, and we're stronger than  ever. I mean, we really are. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. Galu, getting your first look at the new Foa Foa tribe. Ashley voted out at the last Tribal Council. All right, you guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, one person from each tribe will be strapped  into a large sphere. That person will then guide two blindfolded tribe mates as they push the  sphere through a long course to a table maze. The person inside the sphere will then guide the rest of their blindfolded  tribe mates as they navigate a ball through a table maze to a finish hole. First tribe to get it right wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Pizza! Hot, piping pizza. You guys have been enduring a lot of rain. A nice, hot pizza will go down really good, right? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: There's one twist-- win or lose, both tribes going to Tribal Council. Both tribes will vote somebody out tonight. You'll enjoy the pizza tonight when the winning tribe sits in on the losing  tribe's Tribal Council. <br/>Oh, yeah, yeah. <br/>Probst: So, not only will you see what is going on within the tribe, you will  do it by enjoying pizza in front of them. All right, Galu, you have four extra members, sitting four people out. Who's going to sit out this challenge? <br/>You know, I feel weaker as the days go on, but I'm the leader. I got to go forward. I can't look back. And I'm playing the game. Monica, Kelly, Shambo, Dave. <br/>Probst: All right, you four take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. For Foa Foa, navigating in the ball is Liz; pushing, Russell and Jaison. For Galu, it's Laura in the ball; Russell and Erik doing the pushing. Here we go! Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Straight, straight. <br/>Go, go, go. Keep going. Keep going. <br/>Probst: Galu off to a good start. <br/>Okay, left, left, left. To your left! Good, good, good. Keep going. They're behind us. <br/>Straight, straight, straight. <br/>Right, right, go! <br/>Probst: Foa Foa pushing their ball right into Erik. They're on top of Erik. <br/>Straight, straight. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa trying to sneak around the right. Liz does it. Foa Foa now in the lead. <br/>To your right, to your right. To your right. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa now off course. Galu now back in the lead. <br/>Forward, forward, forward! <br/>Probst: Laura has Russell and Erik doing a great job. <br/>Forward, forward, forward. <br/>Probst: Galu right into the tree. Foa Foa now trying to go around them again. <br/>Hold it. Now forward. <br/>Probst: They are side by side. <br/>Go, straight ahead. Straight ahead. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa now in the lead. <br/>Russell, push! Under the side, Russell! <br/>This way? <br/>Russell, no, no. Erik, stop. Hold on, hold on. <br/>One short turn. Perfect, now bring it home. We're almost there. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa very close. Galu stuck. <br/>Come on, Galu! Laura, direct them, Laura, we can't hear you! <br/>Russell, go, go, push, push. <br/>Probst: Russell is exhausted. <br/>Russell, push. <br/>I'm pushing. <br/>There you go, one more. Okay, now--  Probst: Foa Foa. You're good. Now you've got to orient Liz so she can see. <br/>Upright. <br/>Yeah, pull up. Pull up  Towards me! Russ, Russ, harder, push harder. <br/>Probst: Russell, Erik, and Laura still struggling to get to the finish. <br/>Okay, now, get into your positions. <br/>Probst: Liz, happy where she is. <br/>Go, go, go. Keep going, come on, Russ! <br/>Probst: Galu getting very close now. Galu has their ball in the right spot. Erik gets crushed in the end. <br/>Get to your spots! <br/>Mick, go...  Probst: Galu put Laura in great position. No extra orientation needed. <br/>Left, left, left, to your left, left, left, left. Left, Russ, left. <br/>Hold on. Stop. <br/>Russell. <br/>Russell! <br/>Russell! <br/>Probst: Laura trying to get Russell on the course. He is exhausted. <br/>Don't fall. <br/>Probst: He has no idea where he's at right now. <br/>Lean down, lean down. Go to your right, go to your right, go to your right. <br/>Grab the handle! <br/>Jaison, push your hands down. <br/>Straight down, Mick, straight down. <br/>Straight down. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa now has a bit of a lead on the table maze. <br/>Brett, down. Brett down! John, up. The ball is right in the middle. <br/>Don't move. Don't move. Don't move! Stop moving. Stop moving! <br/>Russell, get off the table. <br/>Russell, get off the table. <br/>Russell. <br/>Probst: Whoa? Russell, you with me? Hold up, hold up, hold up. Everybody hold up. Medical! Medical! Hold where you are. Everybody, hold where you are. <br/>Hold it, hold it, Galu. Hold it right here. <br/>Probst: Hold right where you are. <br/>Yeah, yeah. I'm good. <br/>Probst: He-- he was out. He was definitely out. <br/>Yeah, I saw that. <br/>Russell, can you sit down for a moment? <br/>Probst: Yeah, yeah, take over. <br/>Russell, sit down. Russell. Lie him down. Can you get the last pack? <br/>Russell, can you hear me? <br/>Come on, Russ. <br/>Russ? Russ, talk to me. Can someone get me that life pack? <br/>Danielle, can you get the life pack? <br/>Russell passed out during the challenge. I mean, I saw him stumbling around, staggering. And I figured it was because he was blindfolded. I couldn't figure out exactly what was going on. I should have guessed he passed out. <br/>Russell, you can hear me? <br/>I'm good. Let's go. Let's go. <br/>Probst: You passed out for a minute. You weren't with us for a second. Just relax and let them do what they're doing. Everybody, you can take off your blindfolds. <br/>Your blood pressure is really low too, Russ. I'm just going to have a listen to your heart there. <br/>I'm cool. I mean, I was a little winded from pushing the ball, but I'm good. <br/>You just need to relax just for a little while, okay? <br/>Probst: Ramona, what's the update? <br/>His blood pressure is even lower than Mike's was. If we stood him up now, he'd just black out and collapse again. <br/>Probst: All right, here's-- here's what's going to happen. I'm going to make a call right now, which is this challenge is over. Neither tribe wins reward. Both tribes will go to Tribal Council tonight. Both tribes will vote somebody out tonight. You're going to both head back to camp. We'll stay here and monitor Russell. If he's able to return to the game, you'll see him at Tribal Council. Foa Foa, grab your stuff, head on out. <br/>Feel better, Russell. <br/>Probst: All right, Galu, grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>We'll be waiting for you, Russ. Get better. <br/>We'll see you back there. <br/>Probst: Either way, we'll see you tonight at Tribal Council. <br/>Hang tight, chief. <br/>If he comes back, I will be shocked. I'll be happy, but I'll be shocked. <br/>You think Russ is okay? <br/>No. <br/>You don't think he's coming back? <br/>No. But I'm not a doctor, I don't know. <br/>Everyone's concerned about Russell. For Russell to go down the way he did today, it shows you how tough this game  is. No one has any experience with this level of dehydration. No one has any experience with the level of malnutrition that we go through. And a guy like Russell gives you everything he's got and more every single  time, and then he comes back and he's a workhorse. And his body failed him today. And it's so unfortunate. <br/>I'm about to make a break for the shelter. (thunder crashing)  I'm so sick of the rain. <br/>Yeah, me, too. <br/>Our leader's not here. And that's a big hit to take. (thunder crashing) It's kind of surreal. We're kind of just not really knowing really what to do. We're used to, we're used to rallying and saying, "Okay, give us our  game plan." (thunder crashing) Uh, but you can't let these emotional  things distract you too much out of the game. You have to keep your focus. Uh, we still are playing the game. We're still thinking about the next person that, that's going to go. But I know my heart is really heavy for Russell. I just hope that he's okay. (sighs)  All right, we'll try and sit him up. <br/>Probst: Sounds good. <br/>All right. <br/>I just want you to sit up from where you are. Just to there. Any head spins there? <br/>A little light-headed. <br/>A little light-headed? Okay. Stay exactly like that. I'm gonna take your blood pressure again straight away and see what change we  got. (device beeping) Russ, are you okay? Russ? Russ? Russ? Just lie down. Come on, Russ. Russ? Russ? Russ, are you with us? Lie down. Russ? <br/>Russell. <br/>Russ, talk to me. Russ, talk to me. Russell, Russell, wake up, mate. Wake up. You there? Mm-hmm? Do you remember what just happened? <br/>Huh? <br/>His heart rate was 97 when we sat him up, and now it's 68. Okay? <br/>Probst: And it dropped like that. <br/>It dropped really quickly. <br/>Probst: Just so you're clear on what's happening is, is we're going to have  to pull you out of the game. There's no question to all of us watching, brother, that, that you are not  okay. <br/>Come on, come on. <br/>Probst: Russell, we've hung in there as long as we can. You are not doing well. I just watched your, your heart rate plummet. <br/>My family depends on me to be the strong one. Is this how you want this to end? <br/>Probst: No, no. It's frustrating to be pulled out of a game you wanted to be a part of for so  long. You were in great shape. You were the leader of a tribe that was dominating. You heard no sign that you were going home any time soon. You pushed and pushed and pushed your body until your body said,  "Enough." There's nothing about that that is a quitter, nothing. <br/>But I'm just dehydrated. I'm not...  Probst: But you're not recovering fast enough. You need help, and if you don't, you're gonna be worse. Russell, I watched you black out in front of me two times. There's no way you could have stayed in this game. I'm gonna leave you alone and stop talking. (Russell sobbing softly)  I feel bittersweet because we were close to winning, and then big Russell had  his medical accident. But when Jeff said that we still had to go to Tribal Council, regardless of  who won the challenge, it was surprising, and, you know, a little upsetting  because none of us want to go back there. We were just there. <br/>I'm packing my bags. <br/>I'm for sure packing mine. <br/>I have a fair sense of what's going on. There's five of us. We're, again, one big family. Natalie and I, we both looked at each other and said it's gonna be one of us. And it will be. I mean, at this point, we need to continue to win, and it doesn't make sense  to vote out one of the guys. My gut tells me maybe I'll stick around because I'm just competitively  stronger, but my fate and Natalie's fate rest in the three guys in our tribe. <br/>Your vote's very simple tonight. <br/>What is it? <br/>It's Liz. And then, uh...  She and I talked about it. <br/>And I'm... I'm trying my best right now. Because you know you and Liz are the two names, of course. <br/>For sure. We knew that. <br/>So, uh, 'cause I'm putting Liz, you putting Liz. I know I can talk Mick into putting Liz no matter what. <br/>I mean, no, she and I already talked. We know that it's pretty simple; I'm voting for her, and she's voting for me. <br/>Yeah. <br/>How what? <br/>I'd like to stay if it's possible. <br/>Every time that we come close to something good, it kind of gets taken away. So, winning today would have been our revenge, you know. They would have had to watch us eat and, you know, understand how we felt. And we were winning. I think what's the most disheartening is not necessarily the losses, but just  the random things that keep happening every time you think you have something  good to go bad. And, you know, I really hope Russell's okay. I mean, that, clearly, is the primary concern. I agree with the decision to cancel the challenge and all that stuff. It just, uh, it just kind of sucks that when you finally feel like you're  getting in a groove and going someplace, it's like, "No, sorry."  Do you think we would have won that? <br/>I think we were winning by a lot. I'm just wondering, with all the stars seeming to be aligned against us, how  many of us actually have a shot at getting real far, you know? <br/>Well, I mean, look at...  This tribe could be done by day 21, the rate we're going. <br/>I think it could be done. I think it can be done. They'll have people flip over there. <br/>I have a feeling that Shambo's going to be gunning for me, and so I want to  be sure that you have my back. <br/>Hold on, hold on. Shh! Shh! Don't talk! Don't talk! They were all over, and they're probably up here, my crabs. <br/>Yeah. <br/>If we were going to Tribal Council, right now, Shambo is going, 100%. <br/>Here's a medium. <br/>From day one, she's never really jelled with the tribe, and she's been over  to the other tribe. None of us have. And so when we merge, she could very easily flop sides. <br/>So what's, what's the skinny, baby? We're voting somebody off tonight. <br/>I don't know, honestly, who should go home. I don't know. I didn't, like, I honestly didn't think we'd come to like a second Tribal. I don't know. <br/>Ever? <br/>I mean, I thought we would go to the merge first. <br/>See, I'm just asking you guys to not write my name down today. <br/>Mm-hmm. I mean, I started the fire the first eight days we were here. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Chief and I collected 100% of the firewood the first eight days we were here. I have been a good competitor, an honest competitor, a fair competitor. I have not lied to anyone in this game. <br/>That's fine, but despite the fact, my name got written down twice. The only person here who wrote it down last Tribal was you. <br/>So, you're writing my name down tonight? <br/>I don't know if I'm writing your name down. I can't guarantee you anything. <br/>Who-who made fire for you the first eight days you were here, Monica? Who kept you warm and dry and safe? <br/>Who didn't write my name down? Everyone else in this tribe except for you! The number one reason for voting off Shambo, for me, is the fact she wrote my  name down last time. And you got to take your enemy out the minute you can, and right now seems  like an opportune moment. <br/>As far as the weak girls go, who's the weakest girl? <br/>Monica. <br/>Totally! <br/>Right? Bar none. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And I'm sorry, as much as people like to talk Shambo, we would not have won  the fishing gear in that first immunity and started this whole ball rolling  without her. And she poses no threat to anybody. <br/>Exactly, exactly. <br/>No threat. <br/>Exactly. None. <br/>Post-merge, she does not have the power, the manipulative power that a  Laura-Monica tag team or a Laura or a Monica sole have. <br/>Voting Shambo off doesn't do anything beneficial for any of us. Monica needs to go for several reasons: one, Monica and Laura have this  mother-daughter/sister-sister relationship. Post-merge, that's gonna be dangerous. One of the two of them needs to go while we still have a chance to get 'em. Laura will be severely weakened without Monica. And Monica, I think, is the clear move because Monica doesn't help us win  challenges at all. Is there a better move than than that? 'Cause I can't think of any. <br/>This is not a bad plan. <br/>So it's me, you, Brett, Dave makes four. Either Coach or Shambo come back, we have numbers; game over. No one flips. <br/>Who else out here hasn't lied but me? No one. Don't vote me off tonight. <br/>Yeah, I know that about you, Sham, but I know... I know that your effort  speaks for itself. <br/>Obviously, it doesn't if you're not telling me you're not writing my name  down. <br/>Just 'cause I'm not telling you I'm not writing your name down doesn't mean  I'm not writing your name down. <br/>Okay. <br/>Shambo is on a very need-to-know basis. Us four guys-- Dave, Brett, and John-- we're pretty good about keeping the  plan within the four of us. We're not gonna be telling her anything more than what she needs to know. <br/>So where you at tonight? <br/>What are your thoughts? <br/>Erik, if you were Shambo, who would you vote for tonight? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Not me. <br/>Not you. <br/>If I was Shambo, I would probably stay consistent. <br/>Who? <br/>Consistent. I'd stay consistent. <br/>Meaning who you voted for last time is probably your best bet? <br/>You would stay consistent. <br/>If I was Shambo. <br/>What if you were John? <br/>Um, I would follow the leader; as in Shambo's the leader. <br/>Really? And if you were Erik, who would you vote for? <br/>I'd vote for Monica. <br/>Really? <br/>Who are you voting for, Shambo? Do you get what this is about yet? <br/>Yeah, I do. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Brett's down with it. <br/>He is? Okay, good. <br/>Dave's down with it. And that's a wrap. <br/>Okay, cool. <br/>Sham, you got to lock it up. <br/>Lock it up. <br/>No worries. If that's what you want from me, that's what you've got. <br/>And don't even-- Hounding at this is not locking it up. <br/>Probst: Well, this is a first-- 13 people at Tribal Council. All right, let me give everybody an update. Russell was pulled from the game. After you guys left, the doctors continued to monitor his blood pressure,  blood pressure was steady. Two, three minutes in, out of nowhere, his heart rate dropped like that. He blacked out again, went down on his back. At that point, there was no question he needed to be pulled from the game. It was the scariest moment I've ever had on this show. 19 seasons, I have never been more afraid in my life of how bad things were. Russell was in terrible shape. So, the update now is that he is in very good hands, being monitored, doing  fine. There was no way he could have come back into the game. Shambo, what's your reaction to hearing that he's no longer in the game? <br/>I feel really sad that that's how he went out, because you see this guy with  this amazing heart and spirit bigger than life. So, I mean, it's-- it's terribly sad. <br/>Probst: Russell, on one hand, it's a break for Foa Foa. <br/>Yeah, he was definitely the strongest on their tribe. But I just don't like the fact that that's how he went out, you know? I mean, if I was going to beat him, I don't want to beat him like that. <br/>Probst: Dave, what does it say about this game, when you're watching not only  somebody you're on a tribe with, and you're also competing against, but just  another human being, going through this crisis? <br/>Well, you know, it's definitely an eye-opener for me. I mean, you get out here and it's like a whole different level that I did not  expect. It's been raining for days. We haven't been dry for more than an hour. It's pretty intense, easily the hardest thing I've ever done, and I've done a  couple of hard things in my life. <br/>Probst: Erik, this has been 15 of the toughest days I've seen any group go  through. <br/>I spent 22 hours in the bottom of a tree trunk, and with 22 hours, the  inability to sleep, you prayed about anything that you could think of. <br/>Probst: Are you literally praying? <br/>I prayed to God. I prayed to Samoa. (thunder) I prayed to... I don't know. I feel like I'm in solitary confinement for a crime I didn't commit, and that  is not anything that was advertised. <br/>Probst: Shambo, what is it that keeps you from saying, "I'm going to  quit?"  I'm the 45-year-old lady here that-- that will not quit. (thunder) And I have been, like Erik, shivering and praying-- "Dear,  God, this is Shannon from Renton. Please, please, please let the sun shine."  Probst: And as we sit here, it is starting to pour once again. <br/>Yup. <br/>You know, it's not just the misery that the rain brings, but it's the  constant fear, the constant torture that it's not going to stop. And every minute, you're terrified. <br/>Probst: Dave, first time we've had everybody here together. What's the status of the game right now? <br/>Right now, it appears, you know, just based on numbers, that Galu is ahead. And I don't know how their spirits are, but they haven't had quite the  sustenance that we have. And I know that our spirits, in spite of the rain, are pretty high. <br/>Probst: Russell, Dave thinks Galu is winning right now. Not so good over here at Foa Foa? <br/>Attitude at Foa Foa is-- is fine. And I think they're going to be shocked in the next couple of challenges  because we can come back. We can even up them numbers, and then it will be a different story then. <br/>Probst: Mick, does today's challenge, even though we didn't finish it, feel  like a moral victory for Foa Foa? <br/>Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we have to take this as a win. We feel like, at that point, we were ahead, and so we'd like to think that it  would have played out and we would have won. <br/>Probst: Erik, it's got to concern you a little bit. This group of five believes they won today's challenge. <br/>well, they had a big win a few challenges ago. We came back and we brought it again. And now today, they got a tie, and that's supposed to make us nervous about a  momentum shift? I don't think so. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the topic of the vote. Due to the unprecedented nature of today's events, in which, for the first  time ever, we did not complete a challenge, there will be no Tribal Council  vote tonight. Nobody going home. Galu, you're not voting anybody out. Foa Foa, you will not vote anybody out. I'm seeing a lot of mixed reactions. Some happy people. And some jaws that are hitting the floor. Erik, is this good news? <br/>We lost a guy today. So, whether we're voting or not voting, we're down already. So let's stop the bleeding at one. <br/>Probst: Russell, you guys would be down to four if you voted someone out  tonight. <br/>Yeah, I think it's the best news I heard all day, because right now, us five,  we're the strongest that we've ever been this whole game. So now, if they beat us fair and square, then we'll send somebody home. But I really believe that the table's about to turn and I'll give 110% that  it does, so I'm going to go all out. <br/>Probst: Erik, with every comment from Foa Foa about "bring it,"  you're getting more and more forward. <br/>Let's line it up and let's do a challenge right now. You know, because that's what Russell would do. He'd be saying, "Are you kidding me? There's five of them over there and there are eight of us over here." I  don't know if there's emotion in me that comes up, but every bead of sweat  that he put into everything he ever did, we're bringing that to you. We will bring that every day, every challenge. <br/>We welcome it. <br/>Probst: Well, it is clear that the events of today have only intensified the  rivalry between these two tribes. Foa Foa believes they've got a moral victory today, and now they can turn  this game around. And Galu believing, "Even though we lost Russell, his spirit is still  with us and we will continue to dominate this game." We're in store for  a great finish. There is one order of business-- Galu, you are now without a leader. Somebody come grab this. When you get back to camp, assign a new leader. That concludes things for tonight. Foa Foa, grab your torches head back to camp. Galu, grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Being taken out of the game for medical reasons is the worst thing I've ever  felt in my life. <br/>One, two, three, lift. <br/>I played every minute to win this game. And to have my body fail me is utterly demoralizing. But even though it pains me to not be in it, to do it and fail is better than  to never try. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor: At Galu, the guys make Shambo one of their own. <br/>Only strategic drawback is that Shambo is so dim that she could screw up our  plan. <br/>Probst: And a Russell seed gets planted in the other tribe. <br/>What I have to do now is work my Houdini magic. <br/>What are we going to do? Go to the final two, the two of us? <br/>Final two. <br/>I'm really ashamed that, you know, I'm not in the game anymore. And I'm angry, because I'm a fighter. But at the same time, I have to be realistic because I have to get well,  because I have an even bigger job to do, one that I love, one they cherish  every day. And that's being a husband to my wife a father to my child.
