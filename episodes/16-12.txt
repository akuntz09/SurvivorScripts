<br/> <br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor,as the game reaches  its final days...  <br/>What is the plan?  <br/>Final five girls.  <br/>Probst: ...a powerful alliance of women has taken  control.  <br/>It's the black widow brigade. We're spinning the guys  around as much as we can, and then we're devouring them.  <br/>Probst: In their first move, Parvati and Cirie organized  the betrayal of their longtime ally Ozzy. Ozzy, the tribe has spoken.  <br/>The plan is in play. [ laughter]  <br/>Probst: Then Natalie spearheaded a second  doublecross.  <br/>It would be brilliant for Jason to go out just like Ozzy,  blindsided, flossing my teeth with his jugular.  <br/>Probst: 11th person voted out of Survivor: Fans vs.  Favorites, Jason. When Jason left, he was the second person in a row to be  voted out while holding the hidden immunity idol. James and Erik are now the  only men left. Anybody who still feels safe is a fool. James, on your way  out, I want James, on your way out, I want medical to look at your finger.  medical to look at your finger.  <br/>It was no big deal, just a little clam cut, whatever,  nothing really to bother with. We got to tribal, and it was kind of swelling  up a little bit, you know. So I just had medical look at it and make sure  everything is good and give me a little antibacterial, and I'll be all  right.  <br/>Okay, I'm just going to stick  <br/>Okay, I'm just going to stick this in, okay? this in,  okay? So we can't let this go very long.  <br/>How many days do I have?  <br/>Till tomorrow morning, when we come back out and look at  this, okay?  <br/>I work with my hands. It's very important that I get this  thing fixed as soon as possible, because I need my hands when I get back  home.  <br/>That infection that's in your finger here has probably  gone into the joint. If, in the morning, this doesn't look good, then it  needs to go look good, then it needs to go to surgery. to surgery. to  surgery. [ theme song playing] [ theme song playing]  <br/>Okay, so, James, now, reiterate.  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>What do you mean, you're out of the game?  <br/>No.  <br/>No.  <br/>Obviously not.  <br/>Obviously not.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>James hurt his finger. He got it looked at. And I guess  the infection is really, really close to the joint, which can lead to  permanent problems. Oh, my God, James.  <br/>It's going to be all right.  <br/>I hope his finger gets better, and I hope that they come  tomorrow morning and say, "Hey, you're fine," you know, like,  "you can finish the game." like, "you can finish the  game." [ snoring] [ snoring]  <br/>I was just walking in the middle of the night with no light,  and I just ate it, really, really bad-- like, the worst fall I've ever had.  And I hurt my knee.  <br/>How's the leg, Lexi?  <br/>Sore.  <br/>Alexis takes a tumble in the dark. James, he has his  finger infected. I know this is bad because I am a nurse, but... that's two  less people I have to fight against for a million dollars.  <br/>This is just so sore.  <br/>This is just so sore.  <br/>It's puffy.  <br/>It's puffy.  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Look at our statues.  <br/>Look at me! Are you kidding?  <br/>Look at Parvati.  <br/>Look at my bathing suit. [ laughter]  <br/>Probst: You like seeing your likeness?  <br/>That's really funny.  <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, you're each going to answer  a series of questions about your tribe mates in private. I'll tally the  results. I'm then going to ask you those same questions, only this time  you're trying to guess whose name came up the most often from the group. Each  time you answer correctly, you get to chop one rope of another tribe member.  When you've chop three ropes, they're out of the game.  <br/>Oh, no!  <br/>Probst: Last person left standing wins reward. Want to  know what you're playing for?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Sure.  <br/>Probst: 30 days is a long time to be away from home. Time  for a little love. Parvati, here's your mom, Gail. Parvati, here's your mom,  Gail. Come on out, Gail! Come on out, Gail!  <br/>You look so good.  <br/>You look awesome. You smell fabulous.  <br/>Probst: Erik, here's your brother, Curt.  <br/>No way!  <br/>Probst: Come on, curt!  <br/>Curt!  <br/>You look so funny.  <br/>I know. I got beard! I got a beard! Look at this!  <br/>Sweet beard. I love it.  <br/>That's Jeff Probst! That's Jeff Probst! He's just standing  there.  <br/>Probst: Erik, you're a freak. Natalie, you know who's here  to see you? It's your mom, Rocky. It's your mom, Rocky. Come on out, Rocky!  Come on out, Rocky!  <br/>Sorry I stink so bad.  <br/>You don't.  <br/>Look at my armpit hair. [ laughter]  <br/>Probst: All right, Alexis, here's your brother, Nathan.  Come on out, Nathan!  <br/>You doing all right? Look at you. Look at you.  <br/>I don't want to let go.  <br/>Probst: Amanda, you ready for some love?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Here's your sister.  <br/>I need a little love.  <br/>Probst: Katrina.  <br/>Oh.  <br/>Hello, jungle chicken. You smell better.  <br/>I do?  <br/>Than last time.  <br/>Really?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Probst: James Sr., come on out. [ applause]  <br/>All dressed up.  <br/>All dressed up.  <br/>What's up, Dad?  <br/>What's up, Dad?  <br/>You look good! I wish I looked like that.  <br/>Probst: Cirie.  <br/>Come on, Jeff.  <br/>Probst: Let's bring out your man. HB, come on out! [  applause] Cirie's husband.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Oh!  <br/>I brought you this.  <br/>I brought you this.  <br/>Oh.  <br/>Probst: The winner of today's challenge, with their loved  one, will go to Jellyfish Lake, where you will swim with literally thousands  of non-stinging jellyfish. It is truly a one-of-a-kind experience. In  addition, Exile Island is back in play again. A new idol has been hidden.  First clue is out there. Somebody's going. Survivors, give you a minute to  fill out your survey. fill out your survey. We'll get started. We'll get  started. You guys ready to get to it?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: You're now trying to guess whose name came up the  most often, even if that's different from what you might have written down  individually. First question, who does the most for the tribe?  <br/>Oh.  <br/>Probst: Everybody reveal. Everybody says James, except  James. Correct answer is James. Everybody got it right...  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Probst: ...except the guy who does the most for the tribe.  All right, Cirie, you're up. Cirie heading over to Amanda.  <br/>Sorry.  <br/>Probst: Amanda takes her first hit.  <br/>Natalie, take your swing.  <br/>No!  <br/>Probst: Erik takes his first hit.  <br/>Ow.  <br/>Probst: Conveniently, Erik is next up. Payback is tough.  Alexis gives James his first hit.  <br/>Ooh, I'm going to fix you.  <br/>Probst: Parvati gives James his second hit.  <br/>Wow!  <br/>Probst: Last but not least, Amanda, who gives Parvati her  first hit.  <br/>Probst: Everybody took a hit, except Cirie and Alexis.  Next question, who never shuts up? Everybody reveal. Correct answer is  Parvati.  <br/>I knew it.  <br/>Probst: Amanda, James, Alexis, and Erik got it right.  Erik, you're up. Take your hit.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Probst: Alexis goes for payback. James goes for  Alexis.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Cirie, I have to get even. [ sighs]  <br/>Probst: Amanda gives Cirie her first hit.  <br/>All right.  <br/>Probst: Erik, Alexis, and James with only one rope left.  Next question, who mistakenly thinks they are in control of this game?  Everybody reveal. Everybody said Parvati, except for Parvati and Alexis.  Correct answer is Parvati. James, you're up.  <br/>This one.  <br/>Probst: James gives Parvati her second hit. Amanda does  the same for Natalie. Erik heads over to Cirie's block, gives her her second  hit. Natalie heading to Amanda, gives her her second hit. Cirie making her  way to Parvati's block. Only one rope left.  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>Wow!  <br/>That's a little vicious, Jeff. [ laughter]  <br/>You're in trouble.  <br/>Probst: Parvati is the first person out of this game. Next  question, who is the most Next question, who is the most honest? honest?  Everybody reveal. Wow, all over the board. Correct answer is Alexis. The only  person who got it right was Cirie. Take a shot. Cirie heads right over to  Erik.  <br/>After I didn't chop you.  <br/>Oh, my God! Your hair fell off!  <br/>My hair flew off.  <br/>Probst: We are down to five. Everybody down to one rope  left. Next question, who are you least likely to invite to a family dinner?  Everybody reveal. James is the correct answer.  <br/>What's up with that?  <br/>Probst: Everybody got it right, except Natalie. Alexis,  you're up. Whoever you hit, you're knocking them out of this game.  Alexis...  <br/>Wow!  <br/>Wow!  <br/>Probst: ...obliterates James.  <br/>Probst: ...obliterates James. James is out of the  challenge and cannot win, but James still gets to knock somebody else  out.  <br/>No! James, I didn't even hit you!  <br/>Oh!  <br/>It's so violent! I can't get over it!  <br/>Probst: Amanda, you're up. Take your hit. Who are you  going to knock out of the game? Natalie is out of the challenge. Cirie,  you're out of the challenge. You have one hit left. And in doing so, you are  going to decide who wins this challenge, Amanda or Alexis. Cirie heads right  over to Amanda.  <br/>Sorry.  <br/>Probst: Alexis wins reward. Nate, come on over, join your  sis. [ applause] Nathan and Alexis going on reward together. You're going to  choose two people to come with you, along with their loved ones. Pick your  first person.  <br/>I'm picking Cirie.  <br/>Probst: Cirie and her husband, HB, going to be joining  you. One more survivor. Who's going?  <br/>Nat.  <br/>Probst: Natalie. Rocky, that means you are going to be  going to Jellyfish Lake as well. All right, Alexis, you have one other big  decision to make. Who are you sending to Exile?  <br/>Amanda.  <br/>Probst: Amanda, get your stuff, head out. Boat's waiting  on you.  <br/>Can I give my sister a hug good-bye?  <br/>Probst: Nope. I'm sorry.  <br/>Love you. Bye, you guys.  <br/>Probst: All right, loved ones, Gail, James, Curt, Katrina,  time for you guys to go. Head back the way you came.  <br/>I'm doing good, dude.  <br/>Bye, Dad.  <br/>I'm doing great.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Probst: All right, James, Erik, Parvati, head back to  camp. James on your way out, I want medical to look at your finger.  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Probst: All right, enjoy.  <br/>All right, thanks!  <br/>Probst: Have fun.  <br/>Probst: Have fun. Head out. Head out.  <br/>How is it faring?  <br/>All right. So hopefully it'll be cool. She might look at  it now and be like, "Hey, it's not that bad." So hopefully she'll  let me stay and we'll be able to just keep things rolling, hopefully.  <br/>Have you got any pain going into your hand?  <br/>No, not at all.  <br/>Any going into the rest of your finger?  <br/>No. It hurts on the sides.  <br/>That's where it's sore?  <br/>Yes, ma'am.  <br/>Okay. The big risk with this is that it goes into that  joint. Bugs that get in there infect the joint really quickly. It's not  superficial. It's deep.  <br/>Probst: So, Carolyn, catch me up. What's the status?  <br/>The risk of leaving him out here, obviously, is that the  infection's going to set in. It's a dirty environment. It's dangerous  potentially for him-- for not just his finger, but his whole hand.  <br/>Probst: So, James, you know the way the game works. It's  always your call, unless medical decides it's too big a risk. So, Carolyn,  are you saying it is too big a risk? Are you pulling him from the game?  What's the call?  <br/>If he'd had absolutely no pain and it was just  superficial, then I'd be happy. But my call is that it is too big a risk. big  a risk. It is. It is.  <br/>Probst: All right, let's get you out of here and get you  to a hospital.  <br/>Cool.  <br/>Probst: Thanks, Carolyn.  <br/>Thanks.  <br/>Probst: Most of your tribe is on a reward, but those that  are here, you want to say good-bye?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: All right.  <br/>I mean, I'd much rather have been voted out, but I'm  definitely ready to go and get this thing fixed. Ain't no need playing with  it. Ain't no need to fraternize about it. Just go and get it done.  <br/>Get out.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>No.  <br/>You're leaving?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>James!  <br/>No way!  <br/>James is, like, one of the toughest guys I've ever met in  my life, and I just have so much respect for James and who he is as a person.  It just... it's just not fair, you know? It's just not right for him to go  out like that.  <br/>Good-bye. All right, man.  <br/>Go drink some beers. It'll be fine. It'll be fine. It'll  be fine. It'll be fine.  <br/>It's going to be so lonely without him.  <br/>I know.  <br/>I know. I'm the only man left. I'm the only man  left.  <br/>Alexis won the challenge, and we got to take our loved  ones. Never in a million years did you ever think you'd do this, huh? And we  got to hike up this little path and go swim with little path and go swim with  stingless jellyfish. stingless jellyfish.  <br/>You see it?  <br/>It's right here.  <br/>No wonder I felt something touching me.  <br/>Ah, I see one. Look, it's in my hand. Look, it's in my  hand. I see more. I see more.  <br/>It was so magnificent to see nature like that. I think it  might have been a breakthrough for me to swim with the jellyfish, because it  kind of, like, opened my eyes a little bit. Like, everything is not a threat.  Maybe it's changed me a little bit as to being afraid of every little  thing.  <br/>Man, there's a million of them!  <br/>They are everywhere.  <br/>Golly!  <br/>Never before have I ever seen anything like this. anything  like this.  <br/>Incredible!  <br/>Incredible!  <br/>Clue number one, "Underneath where the waves lap,  you'll find another piece of the map. Closer than you think, you'll find the  next link." I just arrived at Exile, and now that I'm here, my only  priority while I'm here is getting the while I'm here is getting the idol.  idol. The waves lap right there. "Now go back to the top and look out to  sea. It's not in the mouth where you think it might be. But halfway there,  you'll find But halfway there, you'll find it submerged." it  submerged." I just found the third clue. It pretty much says I have to  align the smallest island with the hut, and it makes a line. So I'm digging a  line from the tower that's still in line with the island. Hopefully I'm on  the right track. If not, I'm going to be doing a lot of digging for no  reason. lot of digging for no reason. Come on! Come on! Oh, my God! [  laughing] I thought I was going to be digging for the rest of my life.  "Hidden immunity idol is buried"-- oh, my God-- "back at your  tribe's camp, underneath your tribe's flag." your tribe's flag."  Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  <br/>Hey!  <br/>Hey! Yeah, Erik's in the cave. He got medically taken  out.  <br/>They took James?  <br/>Are you kidding me?  <br/>Oh, my God, such a huge shock to come back from camp after  that family members' reward and being, like, so high and hearing that James  has been kicked out for medical reasons. It's very terrifying the idea that I  would be sent home because my knee is injured.  <br/>I started bawling, crying. I was, like, so emotional. And  it was just me and Erik. And it was just me and Erik. It's been me and Erik  all day. It's been me and Erik all day. And with James leaving the game, it  kind of puts us in a weird space, because we absolutely have to beat Erik at  the next immunity challenge. If it comes down to him winning immunity, the  women will definitely have to start eating each other.  <br/>We're down to six people now?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah, it's us and Erik.  <br/>So we need to figure out what  <br/>So we need to figure out what we need to do. we need to  do.  <br/>How you feeling this morning?  <br/>It's bad, you know?  <br/>Shaky?  <br/>Yeah. Like, I have no stability in it.  <br/>Right.  <br/>Do you really feel like you can do this for seven more  days?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>You do?  <br/>Yeah. It's not even a question.  <br/>So you don't want us to vote you out?  <br/>It's not even an option.  <br/>Because it just looks like you're in excruciating  pain.  <br/>But I can deal with that, you know?  <br/>Okay.  <br/>This morning, Parvati said, "Listen, girl, like, we  can vote you out and, you know, you can go home and, like, have medical  attention." But, I mean, there's definitely something that was a little  threatening, so I hope that it's not a reflection of her mentality for the  rest of the game. But then again, you never know. But what do y'all see?  Like, what were y'all thinking?  <br/>Erik goes next. I think it depends on who wins immunity  and what happens. Like, what do y'all think?  <br/>If I were to put myself in the final three, I couldn't win  against Amanda. Like, she's played a good social game where everybody is on  her side, and that's where the problem is.  <br/>It's been pretty much me and her since day one, so I feel  like I can't screw her over at this point.  <br/>Right.  <br/>So if something were to happen, as far as her getting  voted, like, I can't have a part in it.  <br/>Yeah, you can't write her name down. name down.  <br/>Like, I just won't.  <br/>Like, I just won't.  <br/>Like, I just won't.  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Amanda,  returning from Exile Island.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Where's James?  <br/>He got medically taken out.  <br/>He got taken out after the challenge.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Probst: Game continues. We are down to six, having three  people leave this game due to reasons other than being voted out-- definitely  a Survivor first. All right, you guys ready to get to today's  challenge?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: First things first. Erik, I'll take back the  necklace.  <br/>Here you go.  <br/>Probst: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For  today's challenge, you're each going to take turns firing a high-powered  rifle, attempting to break colored sake bottles. The first person to break  all three of their sake bottles wins immunity, is guaranteed a onein-five  shot at winning this game. All right, we'll draw for order, and we'll get  started. Here we go. First round, Natalie, you're up.  <br/>Let's go, Nat.  <br/>Go, mama.  <br/>Probst: You are aiming for one of your three colored sake  bottles. Looking for a purple sake bottle. bottle.

[ applause]  <br/>Probst: Erik, once again immunity is yours. Erik is safe  at tonight's vote. One of you five women going home tonight. You have the  afternoon to figure out who it's going to be. Head back to camp. Head back to  camp. See you at tribal. See you at tribal.  <br/>Okay, first of all, I want you guys to know that I don't  have it, so I'm going to empty my bag.  <br/>How many clues did you get?  <br/>Because I don't have it. I could not find the third clue  for the life of me. I couldn't find it. It was submerged under the water, and  the current was so strong I couldn't... I couldn't find it.  <br/>So the clue was in the water?  <br/>Yeah, it was underwater.  <br/>That's frustrating. I'm sorry, girl.  <br/>That's all right. But I wanted to find it, you know?  <br/>That's okay. It's cursed anyway.  <br/>Yeah, that's legit, man.  <br/>It was harder than I thought, obviously.  <br/>The chicken?  <br/>He's biting the dust. You want to say bye?  <br/>Time to go.  <br/>Should I kill it now? Do you guys want to kill it  now?  <br/>I kind of want to do it.  <br/>You want to do it?  <br/>You want to do it?  <br/>Killing chicken!  <br/>Killing chicken!  <br/>Oh, slick. Okay.  <br/>What do you think is the best move for us.  <br/>I think Alexis.  <br/>I think Natalie.  <br/>I think Natalie.  <br/>I really think Alexis.  <br/>I really think Alexis.  <br/>I think Alexis is our biggest threat as far as jury votes  in the end, and I'm looking towards the end of this game right now. I see  where Amanda is coming from, on the other hand, as far as Natalie being the  bigger threat in challenges. So it's kind of a toss-up right now. And I think  that you could get... They want to.  <br/>They do?  <br/>They've been talking about it  <br/>They've been talking about it while you're gone. while  you're gone.  <br/>You really don't think that you could, like, hold it over  his head that you kept him here longer than Ami?  <br/>That's what I was thinking.  <br/>That's what I was thinking.  <br/>Find that damn idol, lady.  <br/>Find that damn idol, lady.  <br/>I think Amanda would do really well in the final three--  really well.  <br/>Amanda is, hands down, the biggest jury threat. And so  it's like... it's not even fun to battle it out to get to the final three to  just...  <br/>Lose to her.  <br/>...lose to her. And if we have an opportunity to take her  out now...  <br/>Luckily she doesn't have the idol.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>So that's the good thing.  <br/>So that's the good thing.  <br/>At this point, I know I'm between you and Parv. That's  where I'm at.  <br/>To vote for me or Parv?  <br/>Yeah. I feel like you guys are big I feel like you guys  are big threats. threats. You know? And, like, when you needed my help, I  helped you out.  <br/>I feel like you could beat me in a challenge coming up. I  honestly do.  <br/>But I helped you out, and I  <br/>But I helped you out, and I knew that you were a threat.  knew that you were a threat. knew that you were a threat.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Here we go. Do you know how to carve up a chicken?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>You on board?  <br/>I was going to ask you. So what's the deal?  <br/>That's the deal.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>And it makes sense, I think.  <br/>Okay. Yeah, I'm on board.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>I'm going to be so sorry to see Amanda go. But  strategically, it's not such a bad thing, because I don't think Parvati or  myself could beat her with jury votes. So it saddens me that it's going to be  Amanda, but it's the game, you know? The game must go on. I want Alexis to  go, but Erik is I want Alexis to go, but Erik is not... not... If I make it  even, Amanda, then we're going to have to vote again. If nobody changes their  vote, then all of us pick a rock, and whoever gets the colored rock, goes  home. That's how it is at this point. At the four, then you do a At the four,  then you do a challenge. challenge. I'm, like, in between a rock and a hard  place. What do I do? Make it even and then pick the rock. You see my luck. I  couldn't even hit a damn I couldn't even hit a damn bottle. bottle. Yeah,  yeah. And it's Erik. No, you know I didn't want it like this. like this.  Because now, to me... Because now, to me... Because now, to me... You know  that I would. You know that I would. You know that I would. So what do I do,  make it a tie? So what do I do, make it a tie? So what do I do, make it a  tie?  <br/>Tender.  <br/>Tender.  <br/>Well, what happened to Amanda?  <br/>No, she's coming. She just wanted to wash her armpits  because I told her she armpits because I told her she stunk. stunk.  <br/>You know, the consensus is me tonight. So I'm going to  have to see if I can get the hidden immunity idol. idol. And if not, I'm  gone. And if not, I'm gone.  <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of the jury, Eliza,  Ozzy, and Jason, voted out at the last tribal council. We have one more jury  member slowly making their way to slowly making their way to tribal council.  tribal council. James making his first appearance since being pulled from the  game by our medical from the game by our medical team. team. All right, jury,  first, let me catch you up. James was pulled from the game for a medical  injury. He didn't want to go. He didn't have a say in it. Now let's get to  the IV bag.  <br/>I had an infection they had to take care of. So that's  very bad. You could lose your hand. I need my hands to work with, so it  wasn't a chance I was able to take. But I'm here now. As long as I have the  IV, I'm good.  <br/>Probst: It's certainly a first. Glad you're here.  <br/>Thanks.  <br/>Probst: Okay, Amanda, let's talk about Exile Island. Did  you spend any time looking for the hidden immunity idol?  <br/>It was really windy, and the currents were really strong,  so I couldn't find it. It's frustrating when you're looking for something to  save your life in this game, and I just didn't do it, unfortunately.  <br/>Probst: Let's talk about threats at this point in the  game. There's the physical threat. Then there's the likability threat. Cirie,  who are the physical threats at this point in the game? Erik and Amanda,  pretty much.  <br/>Probst: You can't vote for Erik tonight. Fingers point to  you, Amanda.  <br/>Yeah, pretty much everyone here has told me that they're  voting for me tonight. The only person that's voting with me tonight is  Parvati.  <br/>Amanda has become like my little sister in this game. I  can't vote for her, and I won't.  <br/>I feel like it's been kind of me and Erik too. You know,  like, we've gone through a lot of this together. And when he needs someone,  he comes across trustworthy. But then when you need Erik for something, he  finds greener grasses somewhere else. That's pretty much how it is.  <br/>Amanda, directly, I think, is blaming me for the fact that  I have to make a decision between who's staying, who's going.  <br/>But you have to understand. Like, I helped you stay here  through the merge, and then I was asking for your help this time, and you  clearly denied me of that. And yeah, I'm mad about it. I'm pretty pissed off  right now.  <br/>Probst: Natalie, at this point in the game, who concerns  you the most in terms of "Can't let them get to the end; they will  win"?  <br/>Amanda. She has done no wrong to anyone sitting over there  on the jury, and voting her out is the unfortunate part of getting down to  this part of the game. But I feel the need to at least be honest with my  reasoning behind my vote.  <br/>To reiterate what Nat said, you know, like, we adore her,  and so, like, we're going to tell her because we respect her so much. I would  grant that to any of these people, because I truly respect every person here  right now.  <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. Erik, you have  the individual immunity necklace. As always, you can give it to somebody else  if you want.  <br/>I'm going to keep it.  <br/>Probst: You cannot vote for Erik. Everybody else is fair  game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Cirie, you're up. Cirie, you're  up.  <br/>This is only because if I did not make this vote, I would  be not make this vote, I would be handing you a million dollars. handing you  a million dollars.  <br/>Amanda, I absolutely adore you. This is one of the hardest  votes This is one of the hardest votes I'll put in. I'll put in.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes.  <br/>It's okay, baby.  <br/>Probst: If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you  want to play it, now would be want to play it, now would be the time to do  so. the time to do so.  <br/>About that, Jeff... I just want to say when I told you all  I didn't have it, I didn't have it then. So I didn't lie. So I didn't lie.  But I got it! But I got it!  <br/>Probst: The rules of Survivor state that if anybody plays  a hidden immunity idol, any votes cast against them will not count, and the  person with the next highest number of votes will be sent home. This is a  hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Amanda do not Any votes cast for  Amanda do not count. count. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is  final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.  I'll read the votes. First vote, Amanda-- does not count. count. Amanda--  does not count. Amanda-- does not count.

Alexis, in order to force a tie, this last vote has to be  for somebody other than you or somebody other than you or Amanda, or you go  home. Amanda, or you go home. 12th person voted out of Survivorand the fifth  member of our jury, Alexis. That's two, and that is enough. That's two, and  that is enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your  torch. Alexis, the tribe has spoken. Alexis, the tribe has spoken. Time for  you to go. Time for you to go. You guys are perfecting the art of the  blindside. That is the good news, and that is the bad news. Grab your  torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night.

Who do you really trust here?  <br/>I think as we make him feel confident, he'll do the right  thing.  <br/>I feel like me, you, and Parv should go to the end.  <br/>I could have literally bitchslapped him, smack him like  his slapped him, smack him like his mother. mother.  <br/>Yeah, I didn't see that one coming at all. But it's a  game, so yeah, I'm not mad at all. I think I made my papa proud. I never lied  once when I was here. I kept the level integrity of who I am outside of the  game. I'm rooting for my girl Nat, not even a question. This is the hardest  physical, mental, spiritual thing I've ever done, and I'm better for ever  done, and I'm better for having been here.
