<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: On day 22, Marcus, the leader of the  Kota alliance, was so confident, he was able to throw away a hidden immunity  idol. <br/>These people are so stupid. I got ten people to throw an immunity idol into the ocean. <br/>That is a very prized possession there this game, and somebody is really  going to wish they had that in a few days. <br/>Probst: But the days of Kota dominance were coming to an end. By using brilliant strategy, a rival alliance led by Kenny...  Behind the scenes, I'm really calling the shots. <br/>Probst: ...has systematically dismantled their foes. They even tricked Randy into playing a fake idol. This is not a hidden immunity idol. [Sugar laughing] Sending him home and humiliating him at the same time. <br/>It wasn't just "ha, ha, ha." It was on and on and on. [Sugar laughing] And I was, to say the least, irritated. <br/>Probst: Can Bob and Corinne, the two remaining Kota, come up with a brilliant  strategy of their own to stay in the game? Seven are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION âª  That was crazy. <br/>Yeah. <br/>The best Tribal so far, for sure. <br/>I think it was. <br/>Bob, was that was your idea to give Randy that fake idol? <br/>Don't laugh like that. You know, that pisses me off, that part of sticking it in his face. I didn't mind doing the thing, but then to just belittle him as he was going  out pisses me off. <br/>I'm sorry, Bob. <br/>I'm over it now, but don't ever do that again. <br/>I really am sorry. I know you feel bad. I'm sorry. I don't feel one iota, a bit sorry for Randy because he dug his own grave,  and it's hilarious that somebody gave him a fake idol and he played it. <br/>For all the lessons you got to teach me, right, about not talking-- not  belittling people. <br/>Corinne, you talk about people all the time behind their back, and then to  their face, you act like a really sweet, little girl with a little bow on  your head. Come on. <br/>I'm not acting like a sweet girl. If I told everybody to their face what I said behind their back, I wouldn't  be playing a very good game, would I? <br/>Well, you shouldn't be talking about people behind their back that you don't  even know. <br/>Why not? It's Survivor. You don't come here to make friends. You come here to play the game. You said it yourself. <br/>Right, exactly. You hit the nail on the head, Corinne. We're here to play the game, and we're playing the game. <br/>I am... In general, I'm a nice person to people I like. I am now in a camp of mutants, none of whom I like, so it's very difficult  for me to pretend to be nice to them. That's not something I'm used That's not something I'm used to, and that's  done. to, and that's done. [chewing loudly] [chewing loudly] [elephant trumpets] [elephant trumpets]  Oh! <br/>Careful of them, careful. <br/>Oh...  And look at this guy. Look at this guy. <br/>Oh, my... Look how... Ah, he's heavy. I would never have imagined me being out here and catching fish. I'm not an outdoorsy types of person. I'm just a gamer at home, but out here, I'm my own man. So I am very proud of myself, because guys like me would never ever be out  here in a situation like this, but only in the game of Survivor. <br/>We're going to eat today, you people! <br/>That is huge, Bob. <br/>That's the biggest fish I think I've ever seen anybody catch. <br/>That thing is huge. Wow, that looks like a mini shark. <br/>This is crazy. I've been able to catch tilapia, turtle and big catfishes. <br/>Yeah! <br/>This is weird. <br/>And little catfishes. <br/>And little baby ones and crawfish. It's kind of weird. <br/>There you go. That way. <br/>There you go. That way. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Bob doesn't look out for himself. He doesn't know how to play this game at all. He's just here to build things, and that's stupid, you know? You know, he's taught me a lot out here, but as far as playing the game, he's  not very good at it. <br/>Good job, Bob. <br/>So I don't mind getting rid of Bob. And I feel like I need to pull the power into my own hands and the power into  my own hands and take charge. take charge. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. âª You guys ready to get to  today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, you will divide into two teams of three. On my go, you will race out into the swamp, where you will find two stations  of sprocket-shaped puzzle pieces. Once you've collected all seven pieces, you must then arrange the pieces so  they work together allowing to you raise the flag. The first team of three to raise their flag moves on to the final round,  where you will square off against each other to solve a slide puzzle. The first person to solve the slide puzzle wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: 31 days is a long time to be without love. I wish I could tell you your loved ones were here, coming around the corner. They're not. But that doesn't mean you can't have a little love right now. I have a Samsung Instinct by Sprint. Loaded onto this phone are video messages from your loved ones at home. I'm going to give you a little I'm going to give you a little taste of that  love right now. taste of that love right now. Here's Andre and Destiny. <br/>Hi, Crystal, this is Dre, your big, old boo. Just want you to know that everything is going well here on the home front. <br/>Hi, Mommy, this is Destiny. I love you. Be safe. <br/>Oh, thank you. I needed that. <br/>Probst: All right, Kenny, you ready for a little love? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Kenny, here's your sister, Jenny. <br/>Hey, Ken, it's Jenny. Uh, I love you so much. I miss you. Do your best, and never give up. [sniffling]  I can't believe I'm crying. <br/>Probst: Why? <br/>I miss her. I miss her. I miss family. I mean, it's been rough. <br/>Probst: You guys can crowd around, too, if you want to see each other's. <br/>Oh, you guys get to see my baby, I hope. <br/>Probst: All right, Susie. Here's your husband. <br/>Hey, hon, we miss you something terrible. <br/>We miss you a lot. <br/>Look at my baby. <br/>Oh, it's terrible how bad it is around here without you being here. The house is way too quiet. <br/>Aw...  Probst: Your man and your son, your two men. <br/>That's my baby. That's my man! <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right, Corinne. <br/>Hi, Corinne. We miss you. Hey, sis. Uh, hope you're doing good out there. Kind of miss you over here. I've got no one to talk to when I've got something crazy to tell someone. <br/>Probst: You got the whole family and the brother. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: All right, Bob. Here's Peggy. <br/>Hi, Bob. How're you doing? I hope that you're doing really well. What I mostly hope is that you're having the adventure of your lifetime. <br/>She's pretty. <br/>Oh, yeah. Yeah. <br/>Probst: Now, that's support. All she said was, "I just hope you're having the adventure of a  lifetime."  Yeah. She's behind me a hundred percent. I'm the luckiest man in the world. <br/>Probst: Aw. Matty, you look anxious. <br/>Oh...  Probst: You want to go next? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right. Who do you want to hear from? <br/>Jamie. <br/>Probst: All right. <br/>Hi, baby. How are you doing? We're happy as can be. Yet, we do miss our other partner, our family member, Matty. And don't ever forget that we love you. And we'll be here when you return. I love you so much. [overlapping chatter]  Wow! <br/>Probst: Matty! <br/>Yup. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: Last, but certainly not least, Sugar. Here's your sister, Rena. <br/>Hey, Jessica, I hope you're enjoying yourself. You have us supporting you all the way, but especially Dad, who's smiling  down at you from above. And remember that we love you so much. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Pretty nice message. <br/>It's really nice to see her and hear that from her. <br/>Probst: All right, guys. Thanks for sharing those with me. All right, so, the winner of today's challenge will enjoy their entire loved  one message-- there is more-- on the Sprint phone, while enjoying a nice  little afternoon of pizza, beer, brownies... You'll fill up your belly and  you will fill up your heart. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: One more thing, because today is all about love, nobody is going to  Exile Island.

All right, we're going to rock, paper, scissors-- see who goes first. <br/>One, two, three. <br/>Scissors. <br/>Probst: Scissors cuts paper. Susie, you choose first. Who do you want on your team? <br/>Matty. <br/>Probst: Crystal, who do you want? Sugar. <br/>Probst: Matty's choice. <br/>Kenny. <br/>Probst: Kenny. Sugar, who do you want? <br/>Bob. <br/>Probst: Bob. We have our two teams. It is Sugar, Crystal, and Bob, taking on Kenny, Matty, and Susie. Corinne, not chosen. Corinne will not have any shot of winning this reward. <br/>When they started to pick, and Crystal immediately picked Sugar, I realized  right away they're all about, you know, sticking together, sticking together,  and it sucks. You know, I don't want to go home. And I don't know, you know, what to do to save myself. <br/>Probst: Here we go. Survivors ready? Go. Out into the muddy swamp. Crystal, Sugar, Bob, all take a hard fall right off the bat. Crystal dragging Sugar. <br/>Stay on the mark. <br/>Probst: Crystal not slowing down for anybody. Gonna have to work together or this is going to be really frustrating. Crystal, Sugar, Bob, first with their pieces. Matty, Susie, and Kenny right behind. Sugar goes down again. That swamp is thick with mud. Hard to move. Matty, Susie and Kenny now making up a lot of ground. Crystal now stuck. Matty, Kenny, Susie back with their first three pieces. <br/>Good job, girl, good job. <br/>Okay...  Come on! <br/>Probst: Crystal, Sugar, Bob, back with their first three pieces. How much do you want that love? Pizza, beer, brownies. Long video message from home. Kenny, Susie and Matty have a good stride going. Working well together. <br/>Over here, baby. <br/>Probst: Everybody exhausted. Matty, Susie, Kenny have their last four sprocket pieces, heading back. <br/>Matty, Matty! <br/>I can't! <br/>Go...  I have no hands. <br/>I know, I know, Matty, but...  Probst: Bob, Crystal, Sugar have their final four sprocket pieces. They're heading back. Kenny, Susie, Matty, extending their lead. Bob, Sugar, Crystal playing it very safe. <br/>This is it! This is it! This is it! <br/>Probst: Matty, Kenny, Susie back with their final four sprocket pieces. Start working the puzzle. Huge time advantage for Matty, Kenny, and Susie. <br/>Come on, Crystal. <br/>Probst: Bob, Sugar and Crystal are back. Start working on it. All the pieces should interlock, so that when you turn them, they will raise  the flag. [indistinct chatter] Bob, the physics teacher, leading his team. Kenny, the gamer, leading his team. <br/>Whoa, wrong one. Where's the small one? <br/>Right behind you. <br/>Spin. <br/>Probst: Bob, Sugar, and Crystal making a lot of progress. Getting very close with the yellow team. <br/>Pull it! <br/>Probst: Bob thinks they have it. And they do. Sugar, Crystal, Bob moving on to the final round. <br/>Nice comeback, guys. <br/>Sorry, guys. <br/>Probst: First to solve this slide puzzle wins reward. Survivors ready? Go. In front of you is what you are In front of you is what you are trying to  duplicate. trying to duplicate. Bob thinks he has it. And very quickly, Bob wins reward! [applause]  Wow, go, Bob! <br/>Yeah, bob! <br/>Probst: That was fast. Bob, come on over. Congratulations. Pizza, beer, brownies, loved one from home on the Sprint phone. This is for you. <br/>Thanks, I appreciate it. <br/>Probst: All right, for the rest of you, sorry, I got nothing for you. Head back to camp. <br/>I really wanted to win that reward. I just wanted to see the whole message that my sister had for me, but Bob won. And we think he's a threat. So if he doesn't win immunity, So if he doesn't win immunity, then he's next  to go. then he's next to go. <br/>Hi, Bob. How're you doing? You know, I miss you an awful lot. I know you're going to do well, and... oh, wait a second. There's something that I wanted There's something that I wanted to show you. Hang on. to show you. Hang on. <br/>Oh, my God! [laughter]  Can you believe this? [laughter] Look what we have! <br/>I know. <br/>You got a little treat. Is this how you been eating? <br/>Oh, yes. Wait, I'll go get some termites. <br/>Oh... no. <br/>Oh, yeah, we've been eating termite and turtle soup. <br/>The moment I saw Bob, I couldn't believe what he looked like. I was just so excited 'cause he smelled like a campfire. He smelled so good and he had that full beard. Your shirt! [laughter]  My yellow shirt! <br/>Oh, Bob! He looks dirty, but I can tell he's very happy. You look really good. <br/>Peggy's here. I was completely convinced, as was everybody else, that the loved ones sent a  video. Cheers! We're in Africa! We're in Africa! [laughter] [laughter]  Y'all was like, "Crystal, are you okay?"  Then you were, like... You couldn't even get the strength up to get back on  the thing. You just stood there. [laughter] [Bob whistles]  Oh! Oh, my God, it's Peggy! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Are you kidding?! <br/>She's coming! <br/>This is where you are. <br/>This is home. <br/>Oh. [indistinct chatter]  It's nice to meet you. <br/>Hi. <br/>So wait, you got to see our loved ones? <br/>It's really nice to meet you. <br/>Did you see my sister? <br/>Did you see my husband? <br/>Hi, Matt.

[Bob whistles]  Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>No, my... oh, no, please. <br/>Oh, my... God. [sobbing]  Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God. [laughing and crying] [laughing and crying]  I was so happy to see Andre. I mean, "happy" is just not good enough to explain. I haven't seen him in so long. And it was just so good to hold him. <br/>We totally didn't expect to see you guys. I mean, we were talking about it. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Seeing my brother, and seeing somebody who loves me and who knows me and who  gets my sense of humor, and who knows how mean I am and loves it, was such a  cool-- like, just... I was overcome with emotion. <br/>"Nobag."  I have a secret two alliance. It's Sugar and Crystal, the big one. <br/>Okay. <br/>And they trust me a hundred percent because I saved both their asses. I saved both their asses. <br/>Okay. <br/>And right now, everybody trusts me. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>But I will blindside Matty. I took out, Jenny, I took out five powerhouses, big guys. Everybody loves me. If I make the final three, I will win this game. <br/>Well, I'll tell you one thing: Dad would be so proud of you. <br/>Yeah. I did Survivorbecause I thought it might help me get a little bit of closure  from my dad's passing. So my sister brought some of my dad's ashes. <br/>Do you want to say a prayer? <br/>Yeah. Thanks, Dad, for everything you've done for me, and I know that you're the  one... You're the reason that I'm here. And that you're with me every day that I've been here, especially when we  were on Exile. And thank you for this awesome opportunity. And thanks for being here with me and keeping me strong, and letting me see  Rena and having all this incredible stuff happen. <br/>Have fun in Africa, Dad. [laughs]  I didn't speak at his funeral because I was a big mess. So it felt good to say a few words because I really needed him here and I  feel like he's... Like, I already felt like he was here, but I feel like, um,  I brought him to Africa and he got brought him to Africa and he got to stay. to stay. <br/>Where are we going? <br/>Down here. <br/>Okay. <br/>I've always been kind of weak and I've always wanted to avoid the tough  things in life, you know? Like settling down and being an adult, you know? And that's what I realized out here. I got to face up to my fears and grow up. And I don't want to let another day pass and me not let Jamie know how much  she means to me and how much I value her. <br/>This is incredible. I love this. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>I love you, baby. <br/>Hey... [whispers]: I love you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. <br/>I want to do the same, baby. I want to do the same with you. <br/>I want to share family with you. And I want to share kids. And I want to share the future, and I want to share the past, and I want to  share everything, Jamie. I really...  We will, baby, we will. <br/>And I want us... I just want to know right now. I really want you to be my wife. And I want... I want to marry you and I want you to be my wife. And I made this for you. Will you be my wife? <br/>Yes, baby. Yes! Yes! Yes! <br/>I'm being serious. I'm not joking around or joking. I really love you. Okay, let me put it on really fast. <br/>I love you. <br/>Here, I made it for you. <br/>You made this? <br/>Yeah, should I get on my knees? Will you be my wife? <br/>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! <br/>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! <br/>I love you, Jamie. <br/>I love you, Jamie. [indistinct chatter]  The whole experience today, it means everything to me. Because I know that Todd's really proud of me, so that really proud of me, so  that makes me feel really good. makes me feel really good. <br/>The good things in life aren't easy. And they require a lot of work and a lot of digging deep. And if you keep digging, you will find it. I mean, it's endless. You have so much ability and gold in you. And if you just dig for it, And if you just dig for it, you will find it. you will find it. <br/>Hey, two peeps. Who wants to get tree mail? <br/>I'll go. <br/>Corinne, go get tree mail. <br/>I'll go with Corinne. <br/>Yeah, go. <br/>All right. <br/>Get going. <br/>You guys want to go. Have fun. <br/>Okay, we'll be right back. <br/>Okay, we'll be right back. <br/>Bye. <br/>Bye. <br/>You know, there is a possibility, very slight, that they might get rid of  Matty if he doesn't win immunity. <br/>Here's what I'm thinking...  You guys, don't you think it's weird that there's a tribe of people are  living together and a couple that of them know they're going? It's so weird. <br/>They're outside, outskirts. <br/>As for now, our five are sticking together because we have a better chance  that way. Hopefully, nobody's going Hopefully, nobody's going to flip. to flip. <br/>He's good at everything. You're the only person that stands a chance against Bob in a physical  challenge, really. <br/>Yeah. <br/>That's true, Matty. <br/>The plan is to vote out Bob and then Corinne because Bob is and then Corinne  because Bob is way bigger of a threat. way bigger of a threat. <br/>Remember when we threw the idol into the ocean? <br/>Yes. <br/>And they never went and checked the bottle. But Marcus threw it in. Did you know that he had the idol in his pocket when he came back and hid it  around camp? And showed me where it was. And said, "It's hidden over here."  No way. He didn't have it when he went to Tribal, so if I win immunity, I can give  that to you. <br/>That's a legit idol? <br/>No, but it sounded pretty good, didn't it? <br/>Oh. Yeah, it did sound good. <br/>I'm going to put it together, and I'm going to imply that I've got the idol  we were supposed to have thrown in the ocean. <br/>Wow. <br/>I am going to make my second very good fake idol of the game. And the plan with the idol is, I'm going to tell somebody on the other side  that I've got the the original idol that was supposed to have gone into the  ocean, so they've got to be ocean, so they've got to be careful how they vote. careful how they vote. <br/>Good for you, Bob. <br/>Good for you, Bob. Good plan. Good plan. Good plan. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>You got it. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: First things first-- Kenny, give it up. [laughs] Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, I'm going to ask you questions about Gabon. Each time you answer correctly, you earn a ball. You're then going to take turns throwing your balls toward a target divided  by zones. The person who lands their ball in a zone closest to the center wins  immunity, guaranteed a one-in-six shot at winning this game. Losers go to Tribal Council where somebody will be voted out. Anything not clear? Let's get started. All right, here we go. First question, true or false: gorillas were actually first gorillas were  actually first discovered here in Gabon? discovered here in Gabon? All right, everybody, reveal. Correct answer is... true. Sugar got it right. Corinne got it right. Gorillas were discovered here in 1847. Sugar gets a ball. Corinne gets a ball. Next question: a male elephant is called a bull. A female elephant is called: "A," a mare; "B," a doe; or,  "C," a cow. Everybody reveal. Correct answer is "C," the cow. Sugar got it right. Susie got it right. Corinne got it right. And Bob got it right. Next question. It is a fact that the Gabonese viper is a poisonous snake. True or false: it is considered virtually harmless to humans. Everybody reveal. Susie and Corinne say it is true that it is virtually harmless to humans. A poisonous snake, Susie and Corinne, is deadly to humans. The answer is false. Yes, it was a trick question. Good news is, everybody's on the board. Everybody's going to get at least one shot at the target. Sugar currently in front with three shots. Last question, true or false: the elephant's trunk has three purposes: it  serves as its nose, its arm, and its mouth. Everybody reveal. Crystal says true. Susie says true. The trunk is the nose and the arm. It is not the mouth. Kenny got it right. Matty got it right. Sugar got it right. Corinne got it right and Bob got it right. All right, well, we know what you know about Gabon. Let's see how it plays out. Head over here. Kenny, you're first up. <br/>Good luck, Kenny. <br/>Let's do this. <br/>Probst: Kenny has two balls. Using your first one. No hesitation. <br/>What?! Oh! <br/>Probst: Nice shot, sixth zone from the center. Matty, you're trying to get as close as you can to that center zone. That looks good. Fourth zone from the center. Matty is now the mark to beat. Sugar. Ooh, soft launch, going to look for some roll. She gets it. Not close enough. Matty, still the mark to beat. Susie, you get one shot. Don't be short, woman. Come strong. Good launch. Not going to be good enough. No shot at winning immunity. Corinne. Ooh, good-looking toss. Nobody. No, fifth zone from the middle. Matty's still the mark to beat. Bob going to take his first shot. <br/>It's all physics. [laughter]  Probst: Good follow-through. Look at that. Bob, with his first toss, is now the mark to beat. <br/>Good job, Bob. <br/>Nice job. <br/>Probst: Crystal got one question right and gets only one shot. Crystal with no backspin. Gets a good roll. Not good enough. Crystal's now out of the challenge. Kenny. Kenny launches it. Oh, it was in, and then out. <br/>Oh, Kenny! <br/>Probst: Kenny is out of this challenge now. Matty with his last shot at this. <br/>No, Matt. <br/>Probst: Nope, Matty falls short. Matty is now out of this challenge. No shot at winning. Sugar up next. Nice, little soft touch. Oh, just misses. Not close enough. Corinne is up. Big immunity on the line. Good toss. Too far out. Bob's up. He is already the mark to beat. He can afford to be a little risky now. It's going to be short. Will it roll? It does. Bob improves his mark. He is now one zone from the center. <br/>Wow! <br/>Probst: Going to be very tough to beat Bob. Sugar. Sugar going for the roll, and she won't get it. Bob, still the mark to beat. Corinne, your last shot at immunity. Goes very high. Will she get a good kick? She does. Is it going to be enough? No. [Corinne groans] Corinne has no shot at immunity. Bob, with your last ball. Bob doesn't improve his lie. Bob is still the mark to beat, though. One last shot. Sugar, this is it. You need to get in either the center zone or the first zone outside of the  center. outside of the center. Anything else doesn't matter. Anything else doesn't matter. Sugar launches it. And a good roll. It's in and out of the center. Bob wins immunity! <br/>Good job, Bob. <br/>Handshake? <br/>Probst: Bob, come on over. [applause] Nice job. <br/>Thank you, sir. <br/>Probst: Bob is safe at tonight's Tribal Council. Cannot be voted out of this game. One-in-six shot at winning it all. For the rest of you, Tribal Council tonight, where one of you will be voted  out of this game. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I'll see you at Tribal. <br/>Winning today's immunity challenge saved me. I'm going to get the fake idol built. There are five Fang members here, and I'm going to suggest that two of them  go in with Corinne and I. If all goes as planned, perfect If all goes as planned, perfect time to  blindside Matty. time to blindside Matty. <br/>Well done, Bob. <br/>Yeah, very good. I felt like such a big dunce. <br/>Obviously, Bob and I know that our numbers are up, so we've got this whole  back story about why we have the idol that was supposedly launched into the  ocean at the Fake Out Feast. But what we needed to have this work correctly was at least one of us to get  the immunity idol, which is exactly what happened. The story is this: Marcus got the idol. You were the only person that knew about it. I've never known about it. <br/>Right. If you hadn't gotten immunity tonight, you would have used it for yourself. But you got immunity, and the only way to keep yourself in this game is to  give it to me so that I'm still in the game, and to take out the strongest  player, being Matty. If they think I'm going to play the idol, they're not going to want to vote  me. <br/>You are a conniving son of a gun. <br/>So are you. <br/>Thank you very much. <br/>I hope this works. It's such a long shot, but it's all we got. Let's do it. I think I'm very smart, and I think Bob is very crafty. And we put those two forces together. This was the best we could do. It would be so awesome if this It would be so awesome if this worked. worked. <br/>The only thing, I think, Corinne's trying to make Bob give her the immunity  necklace. <br/>Probably. <br/>If he gives it to her, it's still before for the vote. So, we just... Bob's got to go. <br/>Yeah, all we know is this five is tight and we're staying strong. And Corinne's gone. No one's flipping. No, we're good. I don't know why everybody's worried. <br/>'Cause this game makes you worry, man. <br/>Bob, uh, won the immunity challenge today. So, uh, today we need to vote out Corinne. But it's dangerous. We're getting down to the final six with Bob still in it, and Bob's a major  threat when it comes down to it, so... it's comes down to it, so... it's  nerve-wracking, man. nerve-wracking, man. <br/>You really can't say anything. <br/>I promise. I swear. <br/>So remember when they threw the idol out into the ocean? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Well, Marcus ripped the string, but had the rest of the idol in his pocket. Never put it in the ocean. He brought it back to camp and hid it with Bob. But since he won immunity today, he's like, "Listen, if we use it now,  you know, it will help."  Who are you guys going to take out? <br/>We're taking out Matty, and that's it. So he may end up going home, So he may end up going home, but I know I'm not. but I know I'm not. <br/>I think right now, your and Bob's best chance is to take out Matty. <br/>Let me see if I can get Bob. <br/>Yeah, I think you, me and Bob should talk. <br/>Well, he doesn't know I told you yet. Let me, uh, soften the blow. Give me a second, Kenny. <br/>This has definitely changed the game, and I think the best shot is to  blindside Matty right now. I think I might have to jump alliances now. alliances now. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. <br/>Yeah. <br/>So we're trying to figure out the best way to strategize. I don't know. <br/>I think the best option is...  Yeah, tell us, 'cause you're just as smart as we are, and we need your input. <br/>I know Matty's not that  I know Matty's not that smart. smart. <br/>So I'm wondering...  Marcus took it off...  Do you think maybe the better person 'cause she's smarter than the rest of  them, is Crystal? Do you think Crystal would separate from the others? <br/>I think Crystal would probably join us. <br/>So maybe...  And if we get Crystal in, we'll go to the final four. <br/>Yup. <br/>And we'll figure it out from there. <br/>Yeah. We come up with a ridiculously harebrained scheme that shouldn't work at all,  and it might actually work, which is so mind-blowing. It just shows you the level of, like, incompetence we're playing like,  incompetence we're playing with. with. <br/>What we're going to do is ask Crystal if she'd like to be on our alliance. And we're giving her the chance to join with us. I just collected these pieces. I'm worse than a raven. I save everything. I don't know about you, but that would fool me. that would fool me. [chittering] [chittering]  How close were you to Marcus when he threw it in? <br/>We were far. <br/>Yeah. You saw the idol that was on the bottle, right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It had a face on it. <br/>It had a face on it. It was... It was...  Right. <br/>That's the idol. <br/>Final four: you, me, Kenny, and Corinne. We don't want to use this tonight. Would you be interested in Would you be interested in taking out Matty  tonight? taking out Matty tonight? Go on board with us. <br/>I'm on board. <br/>Operation Fake Idol II is working like a charm. And the interesting thing is we're not even going to have to use the idol. <br/>Bob said "Matty."  We're taking out Matty? Even better for us. <br/>Look, we have to flush out their idol. <br/>Bob shook my hand and gave me a kiss on the cheek. <br/>What? <br/>So that's a big deal for him. <br/>Okay, look, you have to vote for Corinne. <br/>Okay. <br/>You understand that. <br/>Yes. <br/>Everybody's voting for Corinne. <br/>Yes. <br/>Okay, I'm going to vote for Matty. <br/>That'll be three for Matty. <br/>Three for Matty. <br/>And four for Corinne. <br/>Yeah, I'll make sure he plays the idol, so the idol's gone, Matty's gone--  boom! This is the best plan. I know for a fact that Crystal is going to vote for Corinne. And Corinne is going to play her idol, a win-win situation for me because the  idol's flushed out and Matty's going to be going home. So if this plan works out, oh, I'll be the biggest strategist in Survivor  history. <br/>But it's going to be a little tense there tonight. <br/>We'll have numbers out there tonight anyways. I think it's a good plan. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think it's the best...  I think the four of us... It's going to be my first flop in the game, but  hopefully, it's a good choice. <br/>Every fiber of me wants to trust Kenny. If the idol is real, then Matty's gone. But if they got a fake idol, Corinne goes home, and I've definitely been  weighing who's better to take out. My heart tells me to take Matty out. Corinne is not the threat to me in no way, shape or form. This is, like, my only chance to get him out, and it's been wracking my brain. The mental part of this game is The mental part of this game is kicking my  ass. kicking my ass. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Marcus, Charlie, and Randy, voted out at the last Tribal voted out at the  last Tribal Council. Council. Susie, can you still feel old Tribal lines, or is now this now "How do I  win this game?"  The alliances that you make have to get you to a certain point, and when  people start getting paranoid, it's a domino effect. So you do have to think ahead. <br/>Probst: Bob, does this make sense, this paranoia? Is that inevitable? <br/>This is the first time I haven't been paranoid. I get to realize what it feels like to have this on. But I'll be paranoid next time I come in here. <br/>Probst: Corinne, can paranoia be an advantage? <br/>I suppose it can. You know, obviously, Bob and I are kind of on the outside, and they're a  tight group of five. If paranoia sets in, maybe there is a possibility to try and, you know, break  it up. <br/>Probst: Sugar, what's the worst part about paranoia as it relates to your  game? <br/>People freaking out and believing lies and flipping. I mean, you just have to, like, keep everybody in check and make sure nobody  is being gullible and getting duped. <br/>Probst: Crystal, at a certain point, does it become crazy to trust? <br/>With certain people, yes. Certain people, no. <br/>Probst: And is the whole trick of this game figuring out when that time is? <br/>That is the whole trick of the game: knowing when to trust and when to cut  your ties. <br/>Probst: Kenny, is tonight's vote any more important, less important than any  other vote? <br/>I think it's very important tonight. Because you think that you can trust somebody, and then you don't. Because after you see the votes, you're going to be like, "Whoa, who did  this? Who did that?" So I would say tonight's vote is very important, compared  to any other vote. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. Bob, you have the individual immunity necklace. I assume you're going to keep it for yourself tonight. <br/>Very good assumption. <br/>Probst: Cannot vote for Bob. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Corinne, you're up. Corinne, you're up. <br/>Matty, this is clearly a strategic move, and I'm sorry a strategic move, and  I'm sorry to see you go, bro. to see you go, bro. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. &gt; Probst: If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now would be want to play it, now would be the time to do so. the time to do so. <br/>Probst: Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote: Matty. First vote: Matty. Corinne. One vote Matty; one vote Corinne. Corinne. Two votes Corinne; one vote Matty. Corinne. That's three votes Corinne; one vote Matty. Matty.

Corinne, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Probst: Well, the big theme of the night: paranoia. The question is, how do you make the paranoia work for you and not against  you? Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

Bob put himself in this position. He kind of messed with the wrong guy. <br/>Crystal and Kenny can take out whoever they want. Kenny acts like he's this weak, little meager guy, and he spins all these  lies. all these lies. And Crystal is just a big bully. And Crystal is just a big bully. I can't stand Sugar. I'll never be able to stand Sugar, and I plan to never exchange another  sentence with that girl for the rest of my life. You know, I really just don't like any of those people, other than Bob and  Kenny. And I really, really, really wish Kenny and Bob all the best. And I hope the rest of them have miserable lives.
