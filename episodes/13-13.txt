<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor...  It pissed everyone in this game off. <br/>Probst: Jonathan felt the backlash of betraying his former Raro tribe and  joining the Aitu four. <br/>It's vile to me. I think that he's a filthy, miserable rat. <br/>Probst: At the reward auction... Sold to Jonathan. ...Jonathan's behavior...  And no sharing, right? <br/>Probst: ...fueled resentment. [ burps] And Yul revealed a powerful secret. <br/>I have it. <br/>Probst: The immunity idol. <br/>It's a compass on the necklace. <br/>Probst: Back at camp... [ burps]  Oh, I definitely smell that pepperoni. <br/>Probst: ...Jonathan's character was questioned, even by his new allies. <br/>He's obnoxious. <br/>Jonathan was a little too arrogant, and it just shows a little bit maybe of  what his true character is like. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge... Adam is the first to start untying. ...Adam, Jonathan, and Parvati fought for survival. Adam has the key-- he's moving on! But it was Adam who came out on top. Adam wins immunity! Adam, safe from the vote tonight. Back at camp...  Are they eating? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Jonathan and Candice had it out. <br/>Since when do you guys not share? <br/>Didn't you call me a disgusting rat? <br/>Well, Jonathan, you're a rat because you betrayed everybody in this game. <br/>Jonathan is just a slimeball and needs to be voted off. <br/>Probst: Knowing they were outnumbered, Adam, Parvati, and Candice put  pressure on Yul to dump Jonathan from the Aitu dump Jonathan from the Aitu  alliance. alliance. <br/>Candice, Parvati, and Adam threatened me, pointing out the fact that they  would be on the jury and if I didn't vote off Jonathan they would hold me  responsible, and I'm honestly concerned about it. <br/>Probst: At tribal council...  What am I? <br/>Probst: ...things heated up. <br/>You're a rat. <br/>That's a fact, that I'm a rat? That's enough out of you. <br/>There's absolutely no reason for you to be around now, though. <br/>Says you, Jack. <br/>Probst: But in the end, Yul stuck by Jonathan. 13th person voted out and the fifth member of our jury. Candice was voted out and gave Adam one final good-bye. Candice, the tribe has spoken. Seven are left. Seven are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>I expected no less. So it was all fine. Wow, what didn't happen at tribal tonight? It got pretty crazy there. I was called all kinds of names. "Rat" and "cancer" were the two "Rat" and  "cancer" were the two that I remember the most. that I remember the most. Adam and Parvati are angry that I flopped, and I'm absolutely convinced I  made the right decision. Everybody needs a bad guy, so I become the bad guy, and everybody else is  good, nobody else has lied, nobody else has manipulated things. Everybody knows that's not true. <br/>I'm tired. <br/>I'm really tired. <br/>It was pretty exhausting. I'm going to try to keep my chin up and just keep punching. I don't know how far I'm going to get, but I know that I'm not going to let a  couple of kids like that ruin everything I've like that ruin everything I've  been working towards. been working towards.

[ laughter] [ laughter]  Ah! Oh, my god. Oh! What do I do? <br/>That is a deep cut. That is a really deep cut. <br/>Pressure. <br/>Where is your buff? We have to have somebody look at it because that looks too deep. <br/>I feel like my finger is about to fall off. <br/>There's a slice through the nail, pretty close to the middle of the nail, so  we tried to stay as calm as possible to keep her as calm as possible to keep  her calm. calm. ...trying to open up a coconut. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think that Parvati needs medical attention. <br/>It's like, literally, you can see where it's separated, where the finger is  actually separated. Oh! <br/>Going to have a bit of a look at it here, and then see what we need to do. How did this happen? <br/>I was chopping a coconut with the machete, and I chopped off the machete, and  I chopped off my finger instead. my finger instead. <br/>You're stitching it right here? <br/>You're being so brave, Parvati. <br/>There is something about fingernails falling off that really bothers me, so...  You know, I didn't really want to look at him sticking needles under the  actual finger that was dangling. It wasn't the best sight in the world, mainly because I was thinking that,  you know, with us being a dying breed, she doesn't need to be out there  cutting her fingers off because it's just her and I against the world right  now. right now. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! How is everybody doing? <br/>Good. <br/>Probst: What happened, Parvati? <br/>Thumbs up! I just pulled the old chop-your[1]thumb-off-with-a-rusty-machete  trick this morning. <br/>Probst: Can you get it wet? <br/>I can get it wet a little bit. <br/>Probst: Today's challenge, definitely going to get a little wet. For today's reward challenge, you will use a small bucket to transport water  from the ocean into a larger bucket. When you get enough water in the larger bucket, the weight of the water will  lower the bucket, raising a flag. First person to raise their flag wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: The winner of today's challenge will go to another island. Locals will then take you to a sacred cave, and you'll have a spectacular  picnic. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Fried chicken, meat loaf, apple pie. <br/>Now you're talking. <br/>Probst: In addition, the winner will send one person to Exile Island. There's one other element to this reward. Jonathan, say hello to your wife, Stacy. <br/>Oh! [ applause]  Probst: It's been 31 days. <br/>Probst: It's been 31 days. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Everybody okay? <br/>Everyone's great. <br/>Probst: Parvati, say hello to your dad, Mike. [ applause] [ applause]  Oh, my god! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Probst: Adam, say hello to your dad, George. <br/>He looks just like him! <br/>How you doing? <br/>How you doing? I miss the hell out of you. I miss the hell out of you. You look good. You look good. <br/>Probst: Becky, here is your sister, Sarah. <br/>Sarah Lee! [ applause] [ applause] [ crying] [ crying] [ crying]  Stop crying. <br/>Stop crying. <br/>Probst: Yul, somebody here wants to say hi to you, your brother, Paul. Paul, come on out! [ applause] [ applause]  Oh, god, how are you? <br/>Oh, god, how are you? <br/>Probst: All right, Ozzy, your mom's dying to get out here. Gina, come on out. Gina, come on out. [ applause] [ applause]  Probst: Sundra, your mom, Jeanette. She's running to see you. [ crying] [ crying]  Oh...  Oh...  Probst: Okay, the person who wins this challenge will not only enjoy the  reward. They will share that reward with their loved one. [ applause]  Oh, yeah. <br/>There's one other twist. Not only will they share the reward with you, you will partner up with them  for this challenge. You are all participating. Here's how it works: the survivors will scoop water out of the ocean. You will toss it to your loved ones, who will have to catch the water and  empty it in their bucket. The last twist to this challenge: you will be blindfolded. Your loved ones will be your guide. <br/>Oh, of course! <br/>Probst: We'll get you blindfolded up, and we'll get blindfolded up, and we'll  get going. going. Here we go, for reward. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Adam, come back. Throw it straight like shooting a free throw. Good job. <br/>Up and out. There you go. <br/>You're right. Good. <br/>Was that good? <br/>No, that was very diffused. <br/>Ready? <br/>Yeah, go, go. All right, a little too strong. <br/>Probst: Everybody trying to figure out a system. <br/>I'm trying to set you up. <br/>Going straight. Come on, throw. <br/>I'm missing it. It's stopping about halfway. <br/>To the right! <br/>Good, good. <br/>Probst: Who's going to win this reward? <br/>Throw it more straight forward. Okay, do it again! Do it again! <br/>That was great. Do it like that again. <br/>Throw! You're taking too long! <br/>Probst: Ozzy making a little progress with his mom, Gina. <br/>Ready? <br/>That's it, arc. Good. A little bit higher! <br/>Higher, okay. <br/>Probst: Parvati and Mike starting to do it. <br/>Now throw it straight forward. <br/>From down here? <br/>Yeah, okay. <br/>Probst: Becky and Sarah having no luck. George and Adam not in it right now. Ozzy with another good toss to his mom. Jonathan and Stacy competitive. Ozzy and Gina having fun. <br/>Need more push, more push, more push. <br/>Am I spraying? <br/>Yeah, you're spraying. That one didn't go anywhere. <br/>Probst: Yul and Paul having no luck. Jonathan with Stacy. Stacy using her shirt, wringing everything out into that bucket. <br/>That's a good idea. <br/>Probst: Jonathan and Stacy with the lead right now. Gina doing the same thing, using her shirt, trying to get every drop in that  bucket. <br/>Up and out. <br/>Probst: Sundra, Parvati, you got to pick it up if you want to win this. Sundra not in it right now. <br/>Keep going, yeah! We're filling it up! <br/>Probst: Parvati and Mike with a lot of water. They're now in this challenge. Jonathan and Stacy, Ozzy and Gina, Parvati and Mike, they're all three in it. Jonathan and Stacy very close. Ozzy and Gina, you're falling behind. Stacy doing better using her hair than the bucket. We're getting very close to somebody winning this. Mike and Parvati are very close! That flag is raising! You've got to hit the wood. Jonathan's flag is now raising. <br/>Right here, baby! <br/>Probst: It's Jonathan and Parvati. Parvati wins reward! <br/>Good job, Parvati. <br/>I'm sorry, baby. <br/>Damn it! <br/>Probst: Nice job. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: First order of business: you have to choose one of these six to leave  right now and go to Exile Island. <br/>Jonathan. <br/>Probst: Jonathan not even asking permission. asking permission. He's taking a good-bye. He's taking a good-bye. He's taking a good-bye. <br/>Love you. <br/>Love you. <br/>Probst: Now to the more fun part of the reward. Two other survivors... [ laughter] ...and their loved ones will join you on  this reward. And, Mike, you're going to decide who it is with no help from you. <br/>Oh...! <br/>Probst: No talking from the survivors. Who are you taking with you? <br/>Oh, man. Uh... Oh... Island lady, Jeanette. <br/>Oh, beautiful ladies! <br/>Probst: Jeanette, Sundra, come over here. [ applause] One more choice. <br/>George, right? <br/>Probst: Adam's dad, George. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Loved ones, it's been a pleasure having you here. It's time for you guys to go. You can head back the way you came in. Well, the good news is you're all going back to camp together. <br/>Yay! <br/>Probst: Sundra, Adam, Parvati, loved ones, boat will pick you up in a few  hours, take you to your reward. All right, take them back to All right, take them back to camp, guys. camp, guys. <br/>So you're back at camp. Do you believe I've been here for 31 days? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I was, like, squealing and jumping up and down when I won because it was just  so unexpected, but I needed it. It showed me that I am still in this game and, you know, that I still have a  fighting chance. This is home. I'll give you a tour. Here's the living room. <br/>I'm really glad because I couldn't describe this in words, I don't think. It was great to see George here. George is my dad, and I call him George because he's my best friend. I'm surprised I lasted this long. <br/>Well, I'm proud of you, buddy. <br/>I told you, don't... The chances of me lasting past The chances of me lasting  past tomorrow are slim. tomorrow are slim. <br/>Okay. <br/>I could get into this. <br/>Yes, for a day. I think having my mom come here and see it, it's going to give her a whole  new perspective that I probably could never get across. I mean, this is something that my mom probably would never have had in her  whole lifetime. <br/>Interesting. That's what we have to drink? <br/>Yes, we boil it. So I think actually we're going to get some tonight because we filled up our  water bottles. <br/>Want to see the house where we sleep? <br/>Yeah. <br/>That's awesome! [ laughter]  It's kind of annoying having the camp be overrun with the competitors' family. Parvati and Adam depend on the food that we provide them, so I almost feel  responsible for helping them be strong enough to win that challenge. <br/>Here it comes. You ready? <br/>All right, bye-bye. <br/>Bye. <br/>Have a good time. <br/>Bye, guys. <br/>Bye, guys. <br/>See you guys later. <br/>See you guys later. <br/>Me, too. <br/>Yeah! <br/>It's really nice. <br/>I agree. <br/>I agree. <br/>Laid back. <br/>Laid back. <br/>Laid back. <br/>Exactly! <br/>Exactly! <br/>It was unbelievable. We got greeted by at least 100 people, women and children, just singing to us  and, like, we were celebrated. It was fabulous. It was fabulous. I loved it. I loved it. <br/>We have no idea what they're singing, you know. It's just amazing. The little kids are around us. And then they walk us to this cave, and in this cave, there's fresh water. It was, like oh, my god! Like a little piece of heaven just dropped right off the side just dropped  right off the side of the road. of the road. <br/>They do it twice a year, this religious ceremony where they, like, bless the  cave water, sing and pray, and it's just a ceremonial occasion, and I was so  grateful that that was part of the reward. And it was like, I mean, just a once-in-a-lifetime thing that happened. [ applause and cheers] [ applause and cheers]  Whoo! <br/>Whoo! <br/>I haven't had fresh water in 32 days. It was so cool and refreshing. And when I came up, our skin smelled nice because of the oil. It felt so good. It felt so good. [ cheers] [ cheers]  The world is getting much smaller, and it would only benefit us if we took  the time to learn about somebody else. Because guaranteed there's at least one thing that we have in common. <br/>Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Are those biscuits?! It was unbelievable. The blanket was just full of fried chicken, meat loaf, biscuits-- I mean, I'm  a Southern girl. I love chicken and biscuits. I am so glad I won that challenge. <br/>As you should. <br/>That is good. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Go for it, Adam. <br/>Go for it, Adam. <br/>Got to beat Jonathan tomorrow. That's our goal for the rest of the time we're here. We just have to beat him at everything. I feel like I'm about to explode. <br/>Oh, gluttony is so good. Adam and Parvati without Jonathan around are a lot more chilled out, and we  got a chance to just talk, find out a little bit more about each other and  bit more about each other and just be really calm. just be really calm. <br/>I think we should do something. <br/>All I know is I can't keep feeding Adam and Parvati and have them win. <br/>You don't think it's fair, in a sense, to feed people like a sense, to feed  people like your enemies. your enemies. your enemies. <br/>No, I understand. <br/>No, I understand. Ozzy catches pretty much most of our food, and Adam and Parvati keep on  winning these challenges. So I think at this point, we've tentatively decided to keep on catching food,  but maybe hide some of it from Adam and some of it from Adam and Parvati. Parvati. <br/>I think we should just throw them in the woods. them in the woods. <br/>Right there. <br/>Right there. <br/>Now is a key, pivotal moment, and I don't want to feed people that beat me. So for Adam, Parvati, and Jonathan, no more coconuts. Jonathan, no more coconuts. They can go get their own. They can go get their own. <br/>How was it? <br/>Hi! <br/>Hi, Parvati. <br/>Hi, guys. How are you? <br/>Tell us all about it. <br/>This is a survival game, so the issue is just trying to have an upper edge in  the game and not feeding someone so they can beat you. And Adam is the biggest guy, and he eats the most. And so the less food he eats, the more drained he gets. <br/>If you can't get your own food at this point, then maybe food at this point,  then maybe you shouldn't be in the game. you shouldn't be in the game. <br/>Oh, my god! Oh, my... Thank you! <br/>I'm not done yet. <br/>Oh, my god! The original plan for Ozzy and myself and also Yul was to sort of hide the  coconuts, hide the food, you know, to save it for us for later. But after we saw that Adam and Parvati brought back so much food, we sort of  felt bad. I think the hiding plan is sort of on the outs. of on the outs. <br/>Guys, thank you, seriously. <br/>Guys, thank you, seriously. <br/>People seem more chilled out if we're just our six without Jonathan, so it's  sort of nice that he's on Exile right now. <br/>Oh, Yul's going to cry! <br/>Oh, Yul's going to cry! [ laughter] [ laughter]  Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Jonathan We'll now bring in Jonathan returning from Exile  Island. returning from Exile Island. returning from Exile Island. <br/>Thanks, guys. <br/>Thanks, guys. Hi, guys. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: First things first, Adam, take back the necklace. <br/>No more bling-bling, huh? <br/>Probst: Once again immunity back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to race out into the water and maneuver  across a series of obstacles. When you reach the end, you'll retrieve a bundle of sticks and race back. You must then go out and do this a second time. Once you have both bundles back, you'll untie the sticks and, using the rope  and the sticks, build one long pole, which you will then use to retrieve two  rings. First person to retrieve both rings wins immunity, guaranteed a one-in-six  shot at winning this game and the million-dollar check that goes along with  it. Losers, you know what happens: tribal council tonight. Somebody going home. Make sense? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Probst: We'll draw for spots  Probst: We'll draw for spots and we'll get started. and we'll get started. For immunity, survivors ready? Go! Ozzy leading the pack. He's first to the platform. Yul up on the platform. Yul up on the platform. Jonathan right behind. Jonathan right behind. Yul in the water. He's got to go back to the platform.

Ozzy, come on over. [ applause]  Good job. <br/>Probst: Once again, Ozzy is safe tonight at tribal council. Out of curiosity, anybody here overly concerned that by not winning they're  in trouble tonight? Adam, Parvati. Well, we'll see if your concerns are warranted. Tonight, tribal council, somebody going home. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. camp. See you at tribal. See you at tribal. <br/>Immunity challenge was right up my alley. It was actually quite hilarious seeing people just eating it all over the  place. <br/>Big old nut, isn't it? <br/>It's humongous. <br/>Big green nuts. <br/>Big green nuts. [ laughter] [ laughter] [ laughter]  How's your sister? <br/>How's your sister? There's clearly something up. People don't really know exactly People don't really know exactly what to say  to me, you know? what to say to me, you know? Something is afoot, no question. Something has shifted. How far it's shifted and how much time I have to correct the shift, I don't  know. If they're going to vote Adam off tonight, then I've got two days. If they're going to vote me off, I've got a couple of hours and probably not  a hell of a lot of probably not a hell of a lot of chance. chance. chance. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Great. <br/>Great. <br/>Some people might be like, oh, you know, Jonathan's a weasel and he... whatever,  weaseled his way in, but as far as locking up the final four, if Jonathan  wasn't in it, who would get it? <br/>He was the only one that we knew we could flip. <br/>I understand that. I don't think you're a bad person for that at all. I think that was good strategy, it was great strategy. But at this point, it doesn't matter. Why not have me or Parvati in the fifth spot instead of... as opposed to  Jonathan? <br/>Right. It's a little bit weird for me because I feel like I'm kind of like the  godfather or something arranging a hit on somebody and someone's asking,  like, to take out one person or another. <br/>He doesn't deserve it. <br/>The truth of the matter is I don't know if I'm entirely don't know if I'm  entirely comfortable with it. comfortable with it. I will do everything I can to keep you here because that serves my interest. <br/>I appreciate it. <br/>If I can't...  Listen, clearly, the energy has shifted. And, you know, obviously, my time away was a bad time to be away. You had a feast, you had guests, you had food brought back for you, and  Parvati and Adam are charming young people, they're closer to your age than I  am, et cetera, et cetera. But let's... you know, let's not be stupid, please. You know, I'm the perfect person to keep around. I'm not a threat in terms of immunity. And I saved your hide. And I was happy to do it because I felt like it made amends for my stepping  away, you know, and they're going to say anything they can. Because if you fall for it, then I'm gone, and they're still around in the  game, waiting to take you guys out. It would be stupid to vote me out because I came back and I saved my  alliances' lives. Are they really going to sacrifice themselves and all they've worked for  because Parvati is smiling at them now? You know, because Adam is stepping up and gathering a stepping up and  gathering a little bit of wood? little bit of wood? <br/>Yeah. It's either Jonathan or Adam, because they seem to be the biggest competitors  right now. It's really hard to pick, though, which one is worse. I think that, you know, as long as the girls stay... stay cool... I think  they will. <br/>I think we're kind of set anyways, right? <br/>We're set...  I think the final four is pretty much... As long as no one does anything  crazy and the girls break, we're crazy and the girls break, we're there. there. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury: Brad, Rebecca, Jenny,  Nate, and Candice, voted out at the last Candice, voted out at the last  tribal council. tribal council. Pavarti, let's talk about the reward. Which was better, spending time with your loved one or all that food? <br/>Hands down, spending time with my dad, you know. Seeing just the joy on their faces. They're so proud of us and what we're doing right now. You know, and then when we went on the reward and we were, like, being  celebrated with the villagers, and biscuits, fried chicken, apple pie-- you  can't really beat it. <br/>Probst: Adam, at this point in the game, a good meal can have a direct impact  on the next challenge. <br/>You know, Ozzy didn't go to the reward and he won the challenge, so I don't  know if that's a good theory or not. But I think it's more of going to Exile Island damages you for the immunity  challenge more than getting the reward helps you. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about Exile Island. Parvati, why Jonathan? <br/>Sending Jonathan was a strategy move to keep myself in the game as long as  possible. I'm hoping that they'll begin to see, you know, life is better without him  and keep me and Adam. <br/>Probst: Ozzy, nice not having Jonathan around camp for a while? <br/>Sure. <br/>Probst: Why? <br/>Jonathan's got a very strong personality, and sometimes it's hard to be  around. <br/>Probst: Jonathan, are you learning stuff about yourself that you didn't know,  or have you heard this kind of stuff before? <br/>Well, I mean, I am disappointed and surprised to hear that these two have had  as much influence on these guys and that a day or two in camp, or three or  four, whatever, is going to throw out the trust that I put in them and the  flop that I made for them. But I don't know if that's going to happen. I really hope it doesn't. <br/>Once again, Jeff, just like last tribal council, no one wants Jonathan around. Just the fact that there's six good people out here that really deserve to be  here. <br/>Why don't I deserve to be here? <br/>Just your integrity. You don't have any. You flop all the time, and it's frustrating, every time we come to tribal  council to see them over there, and he should have been voted out each time  they were voted out. <br/>You know, I beg to differ, okay. All of the people that were voted off from Raro were not voted off only by  me, you know. I was in a desperate situation where I had come over there, and it was their  tribe mates who voted for them. <br/>Probst: Do you feel a bit of a debt is owed to you for saving them and giving  them the chance to win this game when they didn't have it? <br/>Um, yes. Some of them would not be here tonight if I hadn't flopped. That's just the truth. But the fact is I have earned my right to sit here tonight, and I believe I  have earned a right to sit here at the next tribal council. <br/>Probst: Yul, Jonathan says that he saved you guys, and yet I've heard you say  that you saved Jonathan? Who saved who? <br/>I think we both saved each other. I mean, our backs were against the wall, and we had to make moves out of  desperation. So I would say collectively the four of us, the Aitutaki four, are in control  of the game to the extent I have the idol and I have a lot of influence  within that. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. Ozzy, you have the individual immunity necklace. I don't assume you're giving it up to anybody. You cannot vote for Ozzy. We also have the hidden immunity idol. If whoever has it needs it tonight, you'd present it to me after the vote. You would be safe, and the person with the next highest number of votes would  be sent home. It is time to vote.
