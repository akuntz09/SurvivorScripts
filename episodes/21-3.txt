<br/> Jeff: Previously on  "Survivor", in an epic battle between the young and the old, former  n.F.L. Coach Jimmy Johnson emerged as a leader of the older tribe. <br/>Everybody in this  world needs motivation and I think I can help motivate this team. <br/>Jeff: But Marty  resented coach jimmy's star power. <br/>I want nothing to do  with Jimmy Johnson in this game. <br/>Jeff: Later the  balance of power shifted in Marty's favor when he and Jill found a hidden  immunity idol. <br/>Oh, Jill! The challenge now is how do we make it work? <br/>Jeff: At the younger  tribe, Shannon called the shots. <br/>I just want to secure  us to go to the final thing. <br/>Jeff: He also aligned  himself to Alina and Kelly B. Who had a clue to the immunity idol. At the immunity challenge, the older tribe had the medallion of power which  roe sides are an advantage. If you use it, the medallion goes to the younger tribe. And they will have an opportunity to use it at the next challenge I'm going to use it. <br/>Jeff: Playing the  medallion turned out to be a smart move because it helped the older tribe win. Tyrone scores and wins! Back at the younger camp, Brenda was on the hot seat. <br/>If my alliance is  doing what they say they're doing, Brenda is the first one to go. <br/>Jeff: So she  conspired with NaOnka to dismantle Shannon's majority. <br/>What I'm trying to  get people to get Shannon out. <br/>Me, too! <br/>Jeff: At tribal  council, Shannon went on a tirade that alienated almost all of his remaining allies. <br/>I'll speak my mind,  that's what I'm doing. <br/>You're digging your  own grave. <br/>I'm going to get this  out of the way, are you gay? <br/>Jeff: Shannon was  voted out leaving Alina and Kelly B. In serious trouble. 18 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Blew my mind. <br/>That was crazy. <br/>Regardless of who  thinks it or not, I think we got rid of the right person for our tribe. We need to go beat these old people. <br/>I think the feelings  for each other are clear, I think we just need to work it. <br/>Jeff really pointed  out we're not united and it would be cool if we finally united. Coming back to camp after tribal council was so fake. Faker than faux fur. <br/>I think it's a good  thing a lot was aired out tonight. <br/>I agree. <br/>Everybody acting like  they all cool with each other. "Oh, we're one big unit, one big happy family." no, we're not  because we've been divided. So Alina, Kelly B. And Jud were in pure shock because their ringleader Shannon is gone. They had a plan and it didn't work, it backfired. So you want to do that? Okay. Just know sooner or later it's going to come back and bite you on the butt. [ã    \theme song playingã    ] âª Got to be fruit, guys. Where there's monkeys, there's got to be fruit. <br/>We heard the howler  monkeys from the other side of the lagoon today so we went to see if we could  find a food source that they were eating. <br/>Oh, wow! [ã    \monkeys howlingã    ] [ã     \jimmy howlingã    ] Wait, jimmy's  communicating. <br/>They're looking at  you, jimmy. [ã    \jimmy howlingã    ] I'm a little star  struck with Jimmy Johnson. Oh, my lord. He is hysterical. He's just at his soul is inspiring. [jimmy howling] you didn't realize I could talk to the animals. <br/>What'd they say in. <br/>They say get your ass  out of here. [laughter] Now if I had bradshaw  with me, we'd really talk to those animals. <br/>I'm a little pissed  off since day one, man. Why do we get stuck with a celebrity on our team. Everyone got glitter in their eyes. If Jimmy Johnson walked across this lagoon right now, they'd probably believe  it. <br/>Fish! <br/>There you go, yeah! <br/>Not very big but  something, right? <br/>It will add flavor to  the rice. Flavor to the rice. <br/>You know, he's a  threat, especially a threat in a post-merge situation. I think you take Jimmy Johnson into a merge, that would be a disaster. <br/>Oh! All right! <br/>Yeah, but the thing  is, this is so far in the future you need to calm down. What you can't do is get everyone stirred up. Right now everyone's about a strong tribe. So I think we show the idol and say listen, we want to use this to keep Espada  strong, we want an Espada winner. We'll save this to the merge. Marty's got the immunity idol and I thought it would pay off dividends in the  long run to gain the trust by sharing it now rather than later. I don't know. I think you should real quick go and get it and show it to everybody, quite  frankly. And go from there. <br/>I got some really hot  coals right here. I don't know if these will light, man, it's so ashy. <br/>There you go. Yeah, baby! [ã    \coughingã    ] You all right, bro? <br/>Oh, man. Every time I get up from that I just feel like spaced out. [ã    \laughsã    ] It's like you're weed  out. <br/>Tingly, dude. <br/>My whole strategy,  bro, is to be out in the open and make people laugh and be crazy. Far out, bro! I'll take what I can get here on "Survivor" island, man. But it goes deeper than just oh, ha ha, keep him around because he's funny. It's like... Hermit crab on my foot. [ã    \laughsã    ] it's like I want to be kept around for  more than because I'm funny. I want to be kept around for my mentality, my spirit, whatever you want to  call it. My face feels tingly man. <br/>Fabio, he's so stupid. I can't stand him. I can't. And I knew the first time I laid eyes on him that I wasn't going to like him. His hair got on my nerves! Such an air head. You just knock on it and you'll hear hollowness. <br/>Off whole, like, face  mask ring. <br/>Do I? [ã    \laughsã    ] So, guys? I have a little bit of an announcement? I found the immunity idol. [ã    \applauseã    ] Whoa! <br/>So I think this thing  will really come into play when we here in a merge situation. So we'll play it when we really think we need it. <br/>That announcement and  move you made right there strengthened this tribe by about five times. My hat's off to you. [ã    \applauseã    ] way to go. Way to go. [ã    \applauseã    ] when Marty announced he found the idol  and wanted to share it with the tribe so the tribe could use it together  against the young kids I was like what a guy! Way to go Marty. I'm thinking he's a nice guy. I would have kept it for myself because if you think about us carrying that  kind of power inter a merge situation, we become invincible. <br/>Because in five on  five, that gives you your advantage, boom, there you go. Marty's stock went way up after that announcement. Jimmy t. Was like "What a great guy, he did the right thing." I think he  came out looking like a superstar so it's good for me in the long run. That's pretty cool. <br/>When Marty told  everyone he found the idol, maybe he wanted some integrity points, team  points because people would perceive it that, hey, he's a team player, on  board with what we're planning to do. I think Marty's shady. I think he's for sure doing his own thing. <br/>Marty could have  easily kept that in his pocket and not told any of us and been in a huge  position of power individually. He just kept us strong as a tribe. Thank you, Marty. I mean that. <br/>It was not going to  be a secret for long that I had the idol. The only way to play it was to make it appear as something for the tribe to  use for the better good to move us all forward, to be strong. But everyone know it is idol can only belong to one person and that one  person is me. <br/>I go see Jane's  laundry services and she'll have everything dry in 15 minutes. No charge and a smile. <br/>I slept maybe two  hours. Hungry. Not as easy as I thought it was going to be. I'm starting to get concerned that this tribe might think I'm a weak link. But I don't consider myself a weak link. Listen, this is the thing I signed up for so I'm just going to go with the  flow. I mean, I do have a bad knee, okay? But that doesn't make me weak. I'm as strong as... I'm not as strong as Tyrone, obviously. I'm not going to say that. That would be crazy. But I'm as strong as any one of the women, even though some of them are built  like mooses. <br/>Can you move that? <br/>Moving a little slow  today. Danny's really struggling. I know he's doing a good job trying to hide it, but he's just... For whatever  reason, physically he doesn't have it. So in our next challenge, if he's a rock star, clearly he's been playing us  all a show. But I don't think so. <br/>Who do you think is  the only person who can shake something up? <br/>Alina. Unless, you know, hidden immunity idols come into play. The thing is, with Alina and Kelly B., we have an option right now. So it's not clear-cut which one we would vote for until right before tribal. <br/>Tribla council drew a  line in the sand and I ended up on the wrong side of the line. They're going to need Fabio and ben in the challenges so Kelly B. And I are not in the best position. <br/>I trust us five and  that is it. If I had anything to say about it next tribal council we're in, I'm  definitely... Either her or k.B. But she still is a bigger threat just because of... She was right along with Shannon  and the whole drama thing. <br/>My alliance right now  it is Chase, Brenda, Sash, myself, and kelly purple. That's our strong five and we've got to get Alina out of here. If we can get Alina out of here, we'll send a shock wave to Kelly B. That's what you get, bitches. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys. Older tribe getting your first look at the new younger tribe. Shannon voted out at the last tribal council. All right, you guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First things  first, jimmie johnson, I will take it back. <br/>For a short time. <br/>Jeff: Once again,  immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, both tribes will race out into a field to collect ten  tribe-colored barrels. Once you've collected all ten barrels, you must arrange them on individual  platforms. Then one person at a time you will toss sandbags attempting to land the  sandbag on top of the barrel. First tribe to get a sandbag on all ten of their barrels wins immunity. Is safe from the vote. Losers go to tribal council where somebody will be voted out of this game. In addition, you're playing for reward. [ã    \crowd gaspsã    ] Jeff: It's a  "Survivor" garden. You have sauces and spices, fruit, you have a sustainable herb garden. Whatever you're already eating, this will certainly improve the taste. Now to the medallion of power. Younger tribe, you have it. If you use the medallion of power, your advantage will be that two of your  ten barrels will be out of the field on their platform with a sandbag on top. Give you a moment to think about it. <br/>I think we can do it  without it. <br/>Jeff: Younger tribe,  are you going to use it or not? <br/>Nope. <br/>Jeff: Not going to  use it. Younger tribe not gonna use the medallion of power, giving up a huge  advantage in this challenge. <br/>We're just pretty  confident that we can take them without using it. <br/>Jeff: This challenge  will play straight up. Give you a minute to strategize. Get started. <br/>The most agile guy,  start with this first barrel and go get the water barrel. <br/>I'll get this one  back here. I'm getting this one by the tree. <br/>Okay, I'll get this  one, then. <br/>Who's good on tossing? <br/>Three or four, five  tosses and then you rotate to the next and put the next toss. <br/>Start off with ty,  first. <br/>If someone gets on a  hot streak... I think everyone  should try it. <br/>One, two, three, Espada! <br/>Jeff: Here we go, for  immunity and reward, Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Jeff: Got to get all  ten barrels back by rolling them. Everybody on a barrel. Younger tribe has two back. Younger tribe has three back. Here come a bunch of barrels for the older tribe. Once you get all ten over the line, you can start stacking them. <br/>Over the line! <br/>Jeff: Go younger  tribe. Older tribe with one barrel left. Start stacking them, older tribe! Younger tribe off to a very fast start. <br/>Come on! <br/>Jeff: Older tribe,  you need to pick it up! You're waltzing through this! It is a race! Somebody going home tonight. Dan, you need to do something! Get all ten barrels on thier platforms! Everybody on the mat. On the mat before you start throwing. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: Younger tribe  starting to toss bags. <br/>Got it! <br/>Jeff: Benry lands the  first bag for the younger tribe. Tyrone lands the first bag for the older tribe. <br/>Yes, Benry! Keep going! <br/>Jeff: Benry lands a  second bag for the younger tribe. Tyrone lands a second bag for the older tribe. <br/>Nice shot t.D.! <br/>Jeff: Tyrone on a  fast start, older tribe leads 3-2. <br/>Come on! <br/>Calm down! <br/>Nice! <br/>Jeff: Tyrone with a  fourth bag. Chase now heading out for the younger tribe. <br/>Come on ty! Nice! <br/>Jeff: Tyrone with a  fifth bag for the older tribe! Younger tribe quickly falling behind in this challenge. <br/>Let Benry go back. <br/>Jeff: Benry back out  for the younger tribe. [ã    \applauseã    ] Benry scores for the younger tribe. It's 5-3. <br/>Nice! <br/>It's now 6-3, older  tribe in the lead. <br/>Ben, don't stress. <br/>Nice! <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: It's now 6-4,  older tribe leading. <br/>There it is! <br/>Jeff: Younger tribe  catching up now. It's 6-5. <br/>I want a shot at  these. <br/>Tyrone with another  shot, just misses. <br/>You got this ben,  there you go. Nice! <br/>Jeff: Benry ties it  up. We are tied 6-6. Ten barrels total. Tyrone misses. Benry puts the younger tribe ahead! Younger tribe leads 7-6. Make it 8-6. Two barrels left for the younger tribe. <br/>Tyrone, you need to  move. <br/>Take a break, t.D.,  let somebody get a shot. <br/>Jimmy t., be quiet. <br/>Benry is on a roll. These two barrels right here, have they taken the advantage, this challenge  would be over. [ã    \cheers and applauseã    ] Benry makes it 9-6 younger tribe. One barrel left. <br/>You're wasting me  back here. You're wasting me. <br/>Jeff: Older tribe  falling apart now. <br/>Let j.T. After this one. <br/>Jeff: One barrel left  for the younger tribe. Just misses. <br/>He had a good feel. <br/>I know, but you're  wasting me here. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: Tyrone scores,  it's 9-7. <br/>Take a break. <br/>Here you go, take a  break, dude, get ready to go back in. <br/>Jeff: Jimmie johnson  putting in Jimmy T. Now. <br/>Take your time. <br/>Come on, Jimmy T.! <br/>Jeff: Jimmy T. Lands for the older tribe. It's 9-8. [ã    \screamingã    ]. <br/>Jeff: On and off. <br/>Keep it going. <br/>Come on, j.T . <br/>Almost, jimmy! [ã    \cheers and applauseã    ] Jeff: Younger side  wins immunity and reward! [ã    \cheers and applauseã    ] Oh, my God! <br/>Nice! <br/>You're a rock star! [ã    \applauseã    ] Jeff: Younger tribe,  congratulations. [ã    \applauseã    ] you decided not to use the medallion of  power, you didn't need it, Benry, you dominated this challenge and won it for  the younger tribe. Now you have the medallion of power to use at the next challenge and you also  keep the older tribe from using it. Congratulations. Come get your reward and head on back to camp. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>I'll get the sauces. <br/>After we won the  challenge, I went right for the fruit basket and I could see the hidden  immunity idol clue. I grabbed up one side and I saw it right at the bottom and then I saw nay  looking down, too, and I was like, oh, shoot, that's not good. <br/>Kelly b. She was scared, I could see the little wheels turning. She's probably like, "Dang. Of all people, why did it have to be NaOnka to see it." so I had to come  up with a game plan. As soon as we get back to our home, I'm going for it. Damn the fruit, I'm going straight for the paper. <br/>Jeff: All right, the  result, another loss for the older tribe, somebody else from this tribe will  be voted out at tonight's tribal council. You have the afternoon to figure out who it's going to be. Grab your stuff, head back to camp, I'll see you at tribal. <br/>Whoa, whoa! <br/>Wow. <br/>Yup. <br/>What are you doing? <br/>What is that about? <br/>Leaving the  challenge, I wasn't going to let Kelly B. Out of my sight at all. So I'm watching her, she looks at me and I'm looking at her like yeah, I see  you. I know exactly what you're doing. You think I'm about to take my eyes off of it. <br/>Sorry about smushing  your bananas. I did what I had to do. That paper was basically like a million dollars. That's the lifeline in this game. Getting a clue, that's the lifeline. <br/>There was a note? Come on, Fabio! <br/>That's why she just... Knocked her down and  got clue. Got a note. <br/>And you smush all the  bananas? <br/>That sucks so bad. <br/>Naonka and I were  carrying the fruit basket in and the next thing I know, she just pummeled me. Just pushed me out of the way. She went after the clue and then kind of wandered off. I was pissed because Alina and I really need the hidden immunity idol. <br/>I can't believe that,  man. <br/>Completely uncalled  for. <br/>I'm just getting sick  of it. <br/>I saw them talking  "That bitch NaOnka, she got the clue." and I know aline is making  them seem like "She just pushed me out of the way, I didn't even know  what was going on!" go ahead, be a fool, because if it happens again  I'll pull you again. And I'll push you so hard that damn leg will fly off. "This a clue to a hidden immunity idol. It's up to you whether you share this information with anyone else. Decipher the clues to find the hidden immunity idol." it's going to take  me forever to figure this out. You could say I got 'hood. I sure did. I got 'hood. I didn't get ghetto. Ghetto would have been "Girl, you know I had to whoop that and get that,  girl, you tripping, girl, uh-uh, girl." no, I just whoop! It's the game, it's the game. She has one leg. Don't think that I'm gonna be nice to you because you have one leg. I'm not gonna where nice to you. You got to be kidding. My name is NaOnka, not fool. <br/>You want to see it? <br/>Sure. <br/>"Decipher the  clues to find it." equals west tree? Sunset tree? <br/>So we know it's over  there way somewhere. <br/>Well it's eight steps  west of something. <br/>I'm getting thrown  because there's feet here and an arm here. <br/>Elbow. Nay showed it to me and I think she's... I'm the only person she showed. I just keep thinking about it and thinking about it. Once we see we'll start deducting. Damn that tree looks obvious. She definitely in my eyes that has power right now, I'm keeping as tight with  her as possible. Thank God it's not in Alina and k.B.'s hands. <br/>Alina, she should be  shaking like a leaf on one branch and that's the only leaf there hanging on  for dear life. <br/>The challenge today  was pretty much of a disaster. We ended up losing both reward and immunity. Is not only do we have to go to tribal council, they walked off with a whole  mess of bananas and spices and it was pretty tough to take. <br/>I'm going to speak my  mind one little piece to the whole tribe while we're all here. I really feel like I got some talent are being wasted. Coach, evaluate me. As you look at me a little better I got skilled. And if you leave them on the bench, it's going to cost us. The guys that are the leaders are squelching me because I'm an obvious leader  and they know it. If these people knew what they were doing, I would be the leader of this  tribe and I would lead them well. Right now, Jimmy Johnson, he may be catching up with Danny in the useless  department. Just my opinion, I'm not asking for too much, I just feel like I'm being  wasted. I've always had a high opinion of myself as you all know from past  performances and I know I'm kind of a show boat. That doesn't mean I don't have value in these challenges. And we should all... I think it's  obviously disappointing. I think Tyrone you had an awesome tear but then, you know, there was a bunch  of misses in the row. <br/>After I did the ones  I did, they progressively got harder because they were further, obviously,  but I didn't have an issue stepping out. <br/>You are number-one  guy so we wanted to start with you. And so you started missing them so that's when I put j.T. In there for a few shots. You made one. <br/>I did help. <br/>Tyrone, if I may,  keeping it real here, you did have a big long cold spell before he took you  out and even when he did was calling you, called you several times and you  didn't want to come out. You have to be a team player, too. <br/>Trust me, it's not  about me. I just want to win. Some people seem to think I was mad because I got pulled out. No, I was cool with the rotation, whatever. It was just do we want to win or do we want everybody to touch the ball? You know? Everybody can't touch the ball all the time if you want to win. It's not little league where every kid gets to play "X" amount of  innings. It's not. <br/>You had over 50 shots. And you started missing them. We put j.T. In and I think that was a good move. <br/>Okay, very good. <br/>I just thought we  could have planned it out a little better. It's no big deal. Trust me. It's not about Tyrone davis. All I want to do is win. <br/>We all... That's all  we all want to do, win. <br/>Okay. <br/>It was a heated  discussion and kind of enjoyable just to watch a little bit of tension for a  change in this tribe. I hate to say it but I'm looking forward to tribal council. We're finally going to get this tribe to play this game. This is real and it starts now. <br/>I think he's trying  in his own little way. His knees and his back, you know, he's... He's in tough shape, you know? <br/>Well, y'all got to  have a strong team. <br/>I'm worried about Jimmy  Johnson. I think he's full of it. I mean, just playing like, hey, I'm not going to win. I don't buy that. So I need to remove him so that people will lose their daddy. They'll either shake and crumble or they'll have to come to me. <br/>No, I'm good. Whatever. In my mind, Danny, coach and Holly are the same person. It doesn't matter what order. <br/>I disagree. I think he's more strategic than either one of those individuals. He needs to go first. <br/>You come to me and  tell me what to do. The way I see it, Danny, coach and Holly are all equally weak players. Marty for some reason sees jimmy as a threat. Somehow he thinks jimmy's going to weasel or worm his way into the merge. I don't really follow his logic or reasoning. And to be honest, I would prefer Dan because I think he's physically the  weakest. But he's like, no, no, coach is Dangerous. I was like, "Whatever." you're the puppet master. <br/>All right, that's it. No more talk about it, then. <br/>Marty and I are very  solid. I think the next one to go is going to be jimmy. I mean, you've seen him. I'm in much better shape. I'm in much, much, much better physical shape than he is. So when the smoke clears tonight, we'll know whether I go home or jimmy goes  home. <br/>Are we sticking to  the plan of the same... Yeah. Got any suggestions? <br/>Well, do you? <br/>[ã    \laughsã    ] For me it's kind of  obvious, I don't know. We're probably talking the same thing? <br/>I feel bad for the  guy because I like him but coach it is for me. He was never a big Jimmy T. Fan anyway. <br/>Cool. There's some people that are definitely smart. Actually, not that many. But I've got the strategy. Jimmy j.'s got to go first and it will shake the tribe to its core. I've got Danny squared away and I've got Jimmy T. I've got Jill, she totally defers to me. People like Jane and Holly, I mean, look at Jimmy Johnson as if he were the  pope. So that... Just people being stupid. <br/>Damn I wanted a piece  of pineapple and banana. <br/>I know my head's on  the chopping block for tonight. <br/>I don't think so. <br/>Nobody brought up my  name? So you're saying if my name comes up you're going to tell me? <br/>I will tell you. <br/>So who are you  writing down? <br/>I have a feeling it  might be Danny. <br/>Who? <br/>Danny. I really would like to see the weakest player go home. I don't know if Danny's having that great of a time. He's got an injured leg, okay? Spirits are getting a little low with the lack of food. Coach is kind of my fishing buddy, so I really don't want him to go at this  point. I really don't want Dan to go either, but we will see what happens. I do not like going to tribal council. Hate it. [ã    \laughsã    ] Oh, no, no, no, no. <br/>But... I hope not, coach. <br/>It's been an  experience. We'll see what happens. <br/>You never know what  happens at tribal council. <br/>Yeah, I know. I said all along I just want one of y'all to win a million bucks. <br/>I know, but you're  like my favorite person here. I don't want to see you go. <br/>I'm in trouble every  single week we go to tribal council. I know that. I think I'm going to go back up there. <br/>Okay. <br/>I want to keep  playing the game. It's the toughest thing I've ever gone through. I've gone through two a day practices, three a day practices, both as a coach  and as a player, and nothing compares to this. Nothing compares to it. <br/>Marty's paranoid. I think that Marty's very much about Marty. I haven't made up my mind yet, but Jimmy Johnson's life has been about  motivating and leading men. I'm worried about Danny's physical ability to help the team. Dude got ailments. You raise some valid points for sure. But it's not that simple because I got some other people. <br/>All right. There's some people that are kind of shying away from making the tough calls. Tyrone's answer was nowhere near what I needed it to be. It shows he's not thinking this game through at all. I think that's a huge mistake. I'd like Jimmy Johnson gone, and those that want to play with me and want to  play along, jump on board. Do not mess around with me. I mean, I'm playing this game for real, and I'm playing a smart game here. I just hope it all goes the way I'm planning, 'cause this is what needs to  happen, and it needs to happen now. <br/>Jeff: Let's talk  about today's challenge, Marty. What happened? <br/>We had a little bit  of lead going into it, lost some ground and just couldn't pull it through at  the end. <br/>Jeff: Jimmy T., was  there any frustration about how things went down? We should have done this? We could have done that? <br/>Well, as is my way, I  always want a little more play time, so I told the coach right off the bat. These people have been with me for a week, I think they have seen my skill  set, and I don't know why I'm not getting a little more court time, if you  will. <br/>Jeff: So you  literally went to Jimmy Johnson, and said "Put me in coach, I'm ready to  play?" Oh, during the game,  I was, like, "You're wasting me here, coach. You're wasting me here." and I think he knew it, and that's why he did  put me in. He knows I got game. <br/>Jeff: So, Jill, it  sounds like you guys are relying on Jimmy Johnson for some strategy at these  challenges. <br/>I mean, everybody  here is a leader in their own field, wants to play, wants to go get him, and  sometimes that doesn't all gel. So, I guess he's the most accomplished leader of all of us, so we often look  to him. <br/>Jeff: So, jimmy, is  your biggest contribution helping form the strategy of the challenge? <br/>I don't think I'm  really forming the strategy of the challenge. I think I'm listening to them and letting them make the contribution. The other contribution I make is, I help with the fishing, and in the  challenges, they know I'm going to give it all. <br/>Jeff: Holly, give me  an example of Jimmy Johnson's leadership skills. <br/>I think there's been  many times he steps forward, and when we're around the campfire, there's  times where he'll say, "Okay, we need to have a team meeting." he  tries to boost the morale as much as he possibly can. <br/>Jeff: Jimmy T., you  lit up and started smiling. <br/>I was just anxious to  hear what the answer was going to be. <br/>Jeff: Really? Just excited to hear what Holly had to say, huh? I got to ask. How are you getting along with Jimmy Johnson? <br/>Well, I don't think  me and jimmy have had a chance to really sit down and talk. I know he never really approached me, and I never really approached him. <br/>Jeff: How is it  possible, eight days of living together out here, that you haven't had a  chance to speak? Celebrity alone would make most people say, "I'd like to talk to Jimmy Johnson." Of course I'm a big  football fan and a patriots season ticketholder. But, um, I don't know. You know, maybe I'm a threat to his leadership role because I am a leader  where I come from, and I am assertive, often speaking my mind, and maybe he  didn't want to be bothered with that. It could be that simple. <br/>Jeff: Tyrone, what's  that look for? <br/>I... That's... Kind  of baffling to me. Thinks he may be a threat to his leadership role. I just found that interesting. <br/>Jeff: Jimmy Johnson,  are you threatened by Jimmy T.? <br/>No, and, actually, I  feel like I've got a great relationship with Jimmy T. We never have sat down one on one and had long conversations, but I've always  felt it's been a great relationship. <br/>Jeff: So, Jill,  you've lost this challenge. How much does that weigh on your mind as the tribe is getting smaller and  smaller? <br/>It weighs a lot  'cause we're going up against really young, strong-looking players, and I  think that's our motivation for needing the strongest tribe possible to go up  against them. <br/>Jeff: Dan, what about  you is strong in this game? <br/>I think I'm average. I'm not the top of the ladder, but I'm not the bottom of the ladder. <br/>Jeff: Jill, is that  true? <br/>Well, sometimes,  around camp, Dan seems a little stiff, and maybe having problems like getting  up. So, being an older competitor, it's, like, you know, are you going to be able  to bring it during a challenge? <br/>Jeff: Jane, do you  notice Dan struggling to get up, being a little stiff, as Jill mentioned? <br/>He's got a big scar  on one of his knees, so he's obviously had some sort of knee surgery. So that might bother him getting up and down, mm-hmm. <br/>Jeff: Dan, are you  aware that people are watching you? They're checking you out? <br/>Yes, but I'm there,  you know? I'll come up to whatever I have to do, and if I don't meet what they want me  to do, then I'll be voted out. But, uh, I'm there. <br/>Jeff: So Jimmy T.,  you get back from the challenge knowing you've got to vote somebody out at  tribal council. What went down? <br/>I think, overall, the  tribe is planning on keeping its strongest players and remaining strong. That's what they're telling me all the time, and I'm on board with that. Because that's certainly not going to hurt me, so... Jeff: So you're not  one of the weaker players? <br/>Absolutely not. <br/>Jeff: Who are the  weak players? <br/>You know, I don't  want to call people out. But, um, I'll tell you what. We got three or four weak players here. I'm just keeping it real, man. <br/>Jeff: Holly, you  think you're one of the weak players? <br/>No, I don't think I  am. <br/>Jeff: Jane, are you  one of the weak members? <br/>I don't think so. <br/>Jeff: Marty? <br/>No, I don't think so. <br/>Jeff: How about you, Yve? <br/>I don't believe so. <br/>Jeff: Jill? <br/>No, not at all. <br/>Jeff: Tyrone? <br/>Negative. <br/>Jeff: Okay, that  leaves two people. Dan, are you one of the weaker players in this game? <br/>I don't think I am. <br/>Jeff: You don't think  you are, either. So Jimmy Johnson, are you one of the weaker players in this game? <br/>Yeah, I'm the oldest  player, and one of the weakest, too. <br/>Jeff: So the only guy  here who admits to thinking he's one of the weak players is Jimmy Johnson. So, Tyrone, you got to make a vote tonight. Is that a free pass, vote him out? <br/>Uh, there's  definitely other dynamics, but you asked Jimmy Johnson a direct question, and  he gave his answer based on a self-assessment, you know. <br/>Jeff: Marty, how  about for you? What's the goal of tonight's vote? <br/>I think in part, I'm  anxious to get the game a little more accelerated and a little more engaged. People are going to have to start thinking about all the facets of this game,  not just weakest-strongest challenges. There's a lot going on here. <br/>Jeff: Man, if I  didn't think people were thinking about that, the last thing I would do is  remind them. <br/>Well, I just think,  it feels as if we're doing a lot of sort of waiting around, you know? And now, I feel that the pace is picking up. And certainly, going to tribal council is a big driver of that. <br/>Jeff: All right, it  is time to vote. Jane, you're up. <br/>Coach, you said you'd  listen to everybody, but you never really listened to me. I tried to give my input, and it fell on deaf ears, so, go long. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally  the votes. <br/>Jeff: Once the votes  are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Jimmy Johnson. Daniel. One vote jimmy, one vote Daniel. Jimmy. That's two votes jimmy, one vote Daniel. Jimmy. That's three votes jimmy, one vote Daniel. Jimmy johnson. That's four votes jimmy, one vote Daniel. Third person voted out of Survivor: Nicaragua-- Jimmy Johnson. That's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Jimmy, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>One of you, win a  million bucks, okay? <br/>Jeff: Well, in voting  out Jimmy Johnson, you vote out a proven leader. The question is, who's going to step up and fill those shoes? Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on Survivor...  Batten down the hatches. A fierce storm is about to wreak havoc. <br/>Put the boxing gloves  on. Now I'm going to let you have it. <br/>Jeff: Get ready for  hurricane NaOnka. <br/>You knocked me over? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I mean... I'm just letting you  know. Screw your leg. Keep it away from the fire. <br/>I had fun. But I was miserable the whole time. And I still love the game, and it's been a great adventure. This is the most stressful time I've ever gone through in my life, and I'm  including super bowls and collegiate national championships. I initially said, "Keep your strongest members." I obviously wasn't  one of the strongest members. I think they will come together and be successful.
