<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor: Although there were only five Heroes  left, they appeared to be a tight-knit group. <br/>Best team on Survivor right here. <br/>Probst: But their unity was only an illusion because when J.T. found a hidden immunity idol, Amanda and Candice decided he wasn't as trustworthy  as they thought. <br/>J.T.'s the slimiest guy out here. <br/>Probst: The Heroes had also convinced themselves that the Villains tribe was  completely controlled by women. <br/>Sure looks like they got a woman's alliance. <br/>Probst: But there was no women's alliance. <br/>The Hero tribe thinks this is an all-girl alliance. They think I'm on the outside, when I'm the leader. <br/>Probst: In fact, two of the women, Sandra and Courtney, were in the greatest  danger. <br/>We're the ones on the outs. <br/>Probst: When the Villains lost their fourth challenge in a row... Heroes win  immunity! [Heroes cheer] ...Courtney was the next to go. But Sandra made a brilliant move to save her friend. She convinced Russell that Coach She convinced Russell that Coach had turned  on him. had turned on him. <br/>Russell's so stupid. He ate that crap up. <br/>Probst: Her plan worked. Courtney was spared, and Coach was voted out... Coach, the tribe has spoken. ...leaving Jerri without her closest ally. 11 are left. 11 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? We went to Tribal Council and we went ahead and voted out Coach because I  told Russell that Coach was going to vote for him. And that's why Coach is probably now out there looking into the sky wondering  where everything went wrong. <br/>I didn't see that coming at all. I had no idea that Coach was gonna go tonight. Not a clue. I'm not next, am I? <br/>No way, no way, no way. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>You have my word. I will not write your name down, I promise you that. Obviously, it was last-minute, and I didn't want to tell you 'cause I didn't  want to freak you out. <br/>Okay. <br/>Don't worry. <br/>Yeah... I don't want to be next. <br/>You're not going to. [Jerri laughs]  Coach was my one and only serious alliance. I mean, he's the only person out here I trusted, so I'm still going to stick  true to the alliance that I created with Russell, Parvati and Danielle, but  at this point, that's all I but at this point, that's all I got. got. <br/>So, what happened? <br/>You didn't know it was going to happen? <br/>I had a strong feeling that I wasn't going to write his name down. Coach betrayed me by telling Sandra that he was trying to blindside me  tonight. <br/>I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't next...  No, I... I promise you, you ain't next. <br/>Okay. <br/>You see, we got five girls on my tribe now. I feel great about it, because I trust three of them. But I don't trust Sandra and Courtney, so they'll be the next to go. to go. I promise you that. I promise you that. I promise you that. [theme song playing] [theme song playing] [theme song playing]  Treemail! <br/>Yeah. <br/>Treemail. Treemail. <br/>Oh, what is this? <br/>"Your next reward challenge requires endurance and a threshold for pain. You would have seen this challenge in Survivor: Tocantins. Each survivor will position themselves between two narrow walls, their feet  perched on a small foothold."  Hmm. <br/>"This time, you will each be paired against a member of the other tribe. Below you must rank your five competitors from strongest to weakest. This will determine who you match up against-- the person with the same  ranking from the other tribe."  Coach screamed at the end of his, and was, like... [yelling] [laughter]  He did. <br/>Jumped off, you guys. <br/>Strongest. I'm obviously the strongest, but I'm the heaviest, too. <br/>I think maybe all the girls should play. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We have little feet. We're lighter. <br/>So do I. <br/>I think we have an upper hand against them, five women. <br/>So do I. <br/>Me and Danielle both won our endurance challenge. <br/>They're going to put all the guys at the top, 'cause it says, put your  strongest to your weakest, and, you know, they're guys with big egos. <br/>I'll be able to do great at this. <br/>You think you're going to do the best? <br/>Yeah. <br/>The bigger you are, the harder it is. <br/>If you guys want to put me weakest, that's fine. <br/>No, no, no. <br/>I'll tell you the weakest if you're too proud to take it, though. [Rupert laughs]  I think I'm the strongest of all 11 of us still left out here, but if they  want to rank me as the weakest, I'll let them. <br/>Last time, the bigger people went out first. <br/>Right. <br/>I mean, small girls with small feet are really what can do really well at it. <br/>I would love to see all five of us still up there, and three of them just  drop out. [Rupert laughs] Just to make a... make a Just to make a... make a statement. statement. statement. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Heroes getting your first look Heroes getting your first look at the new Villain  tribe. at the new Villain tribe. <br/>Probst: Coach voted out at the last Tribal Council, and Coach became the  first member of our jury. Rupert, what's the reaction to seeing it's Coach that is now gone from the  game? <br/>Phew! Cannot believe Coach is gone, you know. But that women's alliance looks very strong. It's kind of obvious. <br/>Probst: J.T., obvious to you guys it's a woman's alliance? <br/>I would have bet my life Russell or Coach-- one was going to be gone. <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? [all voicing assent] For today's challenge, you will use your arms to brace  yourself between two walls while your bare feet are perched on very narrow  footholds. Every ten minutes, you will move to an even smaller foothold. Once you reach the third and final foothold, you will stay there for as long  as you can. Each person will be matched up against someone from the opposite tribe. All you have to do to score a point-- outlast your opponent. First tribe to score three First tribe to score three points wins reward. points wins reward. <br/>Probst: Want to know what your playing for? [all voicing assent] Well, it's clear you all like to live adventurously, so  let me tell you what is at stake. The winning tribe will receive a feast from Outback Steakhouse. <br/>ALL: Oh! <br/>Bloomin' onion, baby! <br/>Probst: Steak, shrimp on the barbie...  Oh! <br/>Probst: ...loaded baked potato with all the fixings. So much food from Outback Steakhouse, you will not be able to eat it all. [Rupert laughs] This morning in your treemail, you were asked to rank your  tribe to determine our matchups, and in doing so, Villains, you decided who  you were sitting out. Russell sitting out this challenge. Take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, take your positions, and we'll get positions, and we'll get  started. started. Some interesting match-ups. Danielle and Candice. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Courtney taking on Amanda. Parvati taking on J.T., who won this in the Tocantins. <br/>Hey, Colby. <br/>Hi, Jerri. <br/>Probst: A rematch-- Jerri Manthey, Colby Donaldson-- going all the way back  to season two. And another rematch-- Sandra and Rupert going back to the Pearl Islands, our  seventh season. <br/>Love you. <br/>Probst: Go ahead and head on up. First round is ten minutes. You can't use your back, your butt, your hips, your shoulders. Forearms are totally fine. If you want to lean your head against it, if that helps, that's okay. Everybody's looking good right now. [Jerri exhales loudly] This challenge is officially on. Both ranked your tribe, theoretically, from strongest to weakest, but judging  from the fact that J.T. is in the middle, I'm guessing there was some strategy about who the other  tribe was going to put up, and that affected the positions you chose. Since you're resting comfortably early on in this challenge, we have a little  bit of a celebration to note. Today marks the one hundredth day that Amanda has played Survivor. First person to get to 100 days. <br/>Yay! <br/>Yay! <br/>You go, girl. <br/>You go, girl. <br/>Probst: Okay, it is time to move down to the next smaller foothold. Five, four... three, two, one. Everybody looks good. All you have to do is outlast your opponent, and you score a point. First to three wins the Outback Steakhouse reward. <br/>I love Outback Steakhouse. Before my husband left to Afghanistan, that whole week, twice we went there. <br/>Probst: Really? <br/>That's his spot. <br/>Probst: So if you win, not only are you going to get a full belly, you got  some emotional belly, you got some emotional attachment there. attachment there. <br/>The fact that J.T. thinks this is an all-girl alliance gives me a perfect opportunity, once we  merge, to make him think I'm flipping. I done planted that little Russell seed in their mind, and it's taken root,  and they it's taken root, and they believe it. believe it. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to move down to the third and final foothold. If you fall off during this time, you are out of the challenge. We could lose somebody right here. <br/>This peg is little. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one. Everybody's in position. This is where you're going to stay for the rest of the challenge. Your feet are now perched on a foothold that is about a quarter-inch wide. Now, it's going to get a little tougher. It'll start to hurt a little bit. bit. Everybody's got to dig deep. Everybody's got to dig deep. [Colby panting] Colby readjusting, trying to find a sweet spot, somewhere  that doesn't hurt. Once it starts to hurt, it's Once it starts to hurt, it's tough to get rid of  the pain. tough to get rid of the pain. Colby drops out. Jerri scores the first point for the Villains. Jerri can step down. <br/>Hells yeah. <br/>Probst: Don't lose your concentration. <br/>Come on, girls. <br/>Probst: Jerri scores for the Villains. Villains now have one point. You only need three. Parvati readjusting now. [exhales] Rupert fighting through the pain. Rupert with a broken toe. Trying to hold on. <br/>Hang on Sandra. You popped out some babies; this ain't nothing. <br/>Two of them-- didn't even get a aspirin. [laughs] Two natural births. <br/>Yeah, you got it. <br/>Be strong, Rupe. <br/>Probst: Beads of sweat pouring off of Rupert's face. <br/>You got it, Rupe. You got it, buddy. Get in the zone. <br/>Probst: Rupert slobbering now, he's struggling so hard. Rupert is out of the challenge. Sandra can step down. <br/>One more minute. <br/>Probst: Villains now have two points. [laughs]  Sorry, guys. <br/>Probst: The Villains need just one more point. If J.T., Amanda or Candice fall out of this challenge before their opponent,  it's over for the Heroes. Parvati readjusting again, trying to find some way to ease the pain. Amanda struggling a bit. <br/>Courtney, yep. She's shaking, Courtney, she's shaking. <br/>Probst: It could come down to this: Courtney versus Amanda. They played this game together in China. <br/>Courtney, hold on, Courtney. <br/>Probst: Amanda needs to dig  Probst: Amanda needs to dig deep right now. deep right now. Amanda drops out. Villains win reward! [excited shouting]  Oh, my God, oh, my God! Are you crying? [laughs] Nice work. Nice work. [laughs] [laughs]  Probst: Heroes, after four straight wins, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. <br/>Bye, guys. [laughs]  Wah-mbulance. <br/>Probst: All right, Villains, congratulations. Grab your stuff, head out and enjoy it. enjoy it. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. [ice rattling]  Cheers. <br/>To winning. <br/>Yay! <br/>Cheers, Villains. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Oh, my God, that's so good. <br/>Villains forever. <br/>Whoo-hoo! <br/>This is delicious. [sucking air through straw]  You're ready for another one, Sandra. <br/>Sandra, is that their cue? <br/>You were drinking it? Sandra put one down. <br/>Come here, homie. Give me that, homie. <br/>Yeah! <br/>My husband is a soldier in the army, and I kind of felt bad I was without my  husband because I'm sure he wishes he was at Outback Steakhouse, too, because  we just love Outback. We always go to Outback, but, you know, he's got to do his job and I got to  do what I have to do out here on Survivor. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Thank you, Lord, for this meal. <br/>Thank you so much, Lord. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Wow. <br/>Yay. <br/>I've been wanting a salad for ages. <br/>Oh, my God, I'm using a napkin. [overlapping chatter] So after the drinks, we go and our table is set and,  you know, everyone is just diving into their salads, and I picked up the napkin  and, like, flicked it open, and this little, tiny rolled up clue was inside  my napkin, and I was like, "Oh, my gosh, I hope no one saw that."  I, like, stuffed it in my underwear as fast as I could. <br/>Oh, my stomach just said thank you. <br/>Wow. <br/>This is so good. You know, I knew it was a clue to a hidden immunity idol. I was like, "Oh, my gosh, I am crazy lucky because I sat in the corner  next to Danielle and I'm super lucky that it was in my napkin."  If and when the merge happens, all those guys over there think that it's a  girl alliance. It's just so funny that they assume that. <br/>Rupert, too, all the time, he's like, "That all-female alliance looks  really strong."  He's like, "It's pretty obvious. It's so obvious. I'd stake me pirate life on it."  Arr! [laughter]  Perfect. All the Heroes see is an all[1]women's  alliance. First of all, there's no all[1]girl  alliance, and second of all, Russell's running the show. They have no idea what's going on over here, and it's awesome. [laughs]  Mmm. <br/>There you go. Look at that. Thank you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Thank you. Anything you wanted, the Outback way. <br/>Wow. <br/>More shrimp and salad. <br/>We're happy now. <br/>I'm gonna eat enough food for everybody. <br/>This is good. <br/>It's really good. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Mmm. <br/>The best steak and potatoes I've ever had in my whole life. <br/>I'm definitely finishing it. <br/>Yeah. Guys, I'm full already. <br/>You're full? <br/>I'm full. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>I have to pee, though. I'm gonna get out. I'm gonna get out. Pardon moi. Pardon moi. Pardon moi. Danielle. Danielle. My napkin. <br/>How did nobody else see you get that? <br/>I don't know, I just, like, found it in my napkin and it fell into my lap and  I just shoved it in my underwear. shoved it in my underwear. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>"Another immunity idol is hidden at your camp. You want it in your possession, but it does you no good if you don't know  when to use it." I shared the clue with Danielle just so Danielle knows,  like, I'm on her side. I want Danielle to feel tighter with me than she does with anyone else. <br/>You don't have a pocket or anything? <br/>No, but I can put it in my boobs. <br/>It was kind of a part of my plan to make Danielle feel really connected to  me, so that at the end of the game, she feels more loyal to me so that she'll  protect me over Russell. <br/>All right, perfect. <br/>All right, potty break. <br/>I'm gonna go to the bathroom. <br/>We'll fill Russell in on a need-to-know basis, and right now Russell doesn't  need to now Russell doesn't need to know, so he's not going to know. know, so he's not going to know. <br/>You know what? I don't give a damn about steak. I've eaten at least a thousand steaks in my time. [chuckles] So I'm not gonna worry about a damn steak when we got a game to  play, you know? To hear that there were steaks up for grabs was tough because, you know, I  live off steaks. I raise cattle. I cut my own steaks up, you know. We eat black angus beef right off the farm. But we didn't come out here to win steaks. We came out here to win the big prize. If we win this next immunity challenge... I got a plan. <br/>Uh-oh, J.T.'s got a plan. <br/>Let's hear it. <br/>The next immunity challenge guarantees us the finals. <br/>Let's hear the plan. <br/>But we're relying on the merge. I bet my life in this game on it that we're going to merge. Russell knows he's going next. So, granted I get a chance to talk to Russell at the next immunity challenge  and we win, I give him the hidden immunity idol, he votes out Parvati... bam,  done. <br/>How are you gonna give it to him, though? <br/>Hand it to him. <br/>Wrapped up with a sheet of paper with instructions on what to do with it. Parvati's gone. <br/>Then pick the girls off. <br/>Pick 'em off like sitting ducks, then vote Russell's ass out sixth. <br/>I think it's really crazy to give Russell the idol. You don't know what's going on over there. He could be in with the girls for all we know. Like, we don't know. What do you think about this idea? I mean, it could give us the numbers and it gets the idol away from him. away from him. He just gives it up. He just gives it up. <br/>"Cross over the bridge to the dancing trees." Dancing trees? <br/>Let's go look and see if any look like they're dancing. Danielle and I woke up this morning and we're like quiet little mice running  around because there's an immunity idol hidden at our camp and we didn't want  Russell to see us. <br/>Dancing... tree. <br/>It's those right there, right there. You think? <br/>Yeah. Yeah. <br/>They look like they're dancing. All right, so I guess look right here. here. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. It could be behind this. It could be behind this. It could be over here, too. It could be over here, too. <br/>[laughing]: Oh, my God. <br/>What? <br/>Oh, my God, we just found that in, like, four seconds. Here, hold this so I can cover it up. <br/>Nice. <br/>We found the idol. I am the happiest girl in the world that I found that idol because it gives  me control of the game right now. This is a big deal. Oh, my God, I can't believe we have that. And I'm not going to tell Russell about the idol right now. I want Russell to be out of the loop for a little bit. I don't see anything wrong with making him wait. I really don't. It doesn't mean I don't trust him. It's just... I kind of want to see him squirm a little bit. It's fun. [both laugh] It's not all Russell running the show around here. He is not the king of Survivor. I'm the queen. [laughs] And usually the king does what the queen says anyway, so I'm the  queen says anyway, so I'm cool. cool. <br/>You're writing your letter to Russell, buddy? Russell, buddy? <br/>Yep. <br/>Yep. "Russell, this is a huge turning point in this game. This is not fake. I wouldn't waste your time or mine. Just by competing against you and the few handshakes we've had, I feel like I  can trust you. Play the idol tonight and save yourself. All the girls should be writing your name down, so act like you know you're  going home. I think you should write Parvati's name down to send her home. We will most likely merge at ten people, and then you will be completely safe  with us. Our five plus you will remain strong until the girls are done with. We can then work on getting ourselves into the final three."  This is your chance to show you're not a villain. <br/>I'll put that at the end right here. <br/>Good. Oh, my gosh. <br/>It could work, y'all. If that works, it would be incredible. I'm really nervous. I mean, I'm always nervous, but I'm really nervous today because I'm going to  try the big plan today. <br/>If it all works, it's a great plan. <br/>If we win, I'm going to try to give Russell my hidden immunity idol, based on  me guessing that he's on the outs, which I really feel like he is. All right, this is our chance. That will give us the numbers going into the merge. So, it's all up to us. So, it's all up to us. We have to win. We have to win. We have to win. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Oh, yes. <br/>Probst: First things first. Candice-- give it up. [Jeff chuckles] Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, both tribes will start on a platform floating in the  water. On my go, one member at a time must move a bag of puzzle pieces along a rope  and through a series of obstacles to your finish mat. Once you have all five bags, you will use those puzzle pieces to build a  totem pole. The first tribe to assemble it correctly wins immunity, and everybody on that  tribe is guaranteed a one-in-ten shot at winning a million bucks. Losers go to Tribal Council where somebody's shot at that million will come  to an end. Villains, you have one extra person. You sat out Russell last time. Who is going to sit out this Who is going to sit out this challenge? challenge? <br/>Probst: Sandra, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, take your spots. Everybody else, take your spots. We'll get started. We'll get started. Here we go, for immunity! Survivors ready? Go! Jerri for the Villains, and Rupert for the Heroes. Little different from some of the other challenges in that you are not  attached to the rope, just a bag of puzzle pieces. [indistinct shouting] Jerri now with a bit of a lead for the Villains. Just barely. <br/>Come on, Rupert! <br/>Probst: Those bags take on some water, they get a little heavier. Rupert now in the lead for the Heroes. <br/>There you go! [indistinct shouting]  Come on, Rupert! [whooping]  Probst: Rupert flying through this course now. Jerri slowing down. <br/>That's okay, Jerri! Keep going! <br/>Probst: You don't want to lose your lead early. [indistinct shouting] You may never catch up. <br/>Come on, Rupert! <br/>Probst: Rupert heading to the finish with that first bag for the Heroes. <br/>Run, Rupert! Run! <br/>Go, Rupe! Go, Rupert! <br/>Probst: Go, Heroes! J.T. in the water for the Heroes with that second bag. <br/>Go, Jerri! <br/>Probst: Jerri now heading to the finish for the Villains with their first bag. Go, Villains! Danielle in the water for the Villains. J.T. going to be hard to catch right now. Danielle doing a nice job for the Villains. She's definitely made up some of the time that Jerri lost. <br/>Come on, Danielle! <br/>Probst: J.T. on the home stretch with that second bag for the Heroes. Go, Heroes! Amanda now in the water for the Heroes. Danielle is throwing herself through this course...  Come on, Danielle! <br/>Probst: ...trying to make up some time. Amanda now gaining on Danielle. Danielle has the second bag for the Villains. <br/>You got it. <br/>Probst: Amanda has the third bag for the Heroes. Danielle now sprinting to the end for the Villains with her second bag. Go, Villains! Parvati in the water for the Villains. Amanda moving fairly quickly through this last stage of the challenge. Now Amanda's heading back with that third bag of puzzles pieces for the  Heroes. Go, Heroes! <br/>We got it, Parvati! <br/>Probst: Candice now on the course with the fourth bag for the Heroes. Parvati's through the final obstacle very quickly for the Villains. Go, Villains! Courtney now in the water for Courtney now in the water for the Villains. the Villains. <br/>Probst: Candice heading back with that fourth bag for the with that fourth  bag for the Heroes. Heroes. <br/>Probst: Go, Colby! Colby in the water for the Heroes with that fifth and final bag. [thunder crackling] Rain starting to come down now in the middle of this  challenge. Colby launches himself over the tall obstacle. Courtney now heading back with that fourth bag for the Villains. Go, Russell! Russell in the water for the Villains. Colby with a huge lead for the Heroes. [indistinct shouting] Russell is going to have to be Superman out there. Superman out there. [indistinct shouting] [indistinct shouting] Colby racing back with that fifth  and final bag for the Heroes. Start working on your puzzle. Russell doing his best to make up time for the Villains. <br/>You got it, Russell! <br/>I got the middle. I got the middle. Give him the middle. <br/>Get it up, man. <br/>Probst: Heroes making quick work of this puzzle. <br/>Go, Russell! <br/>Probst: Heroes very close. [thunder rumbling] Heroes win immunity! <br/>Yeah! [whooping]  Good job, Russell. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Would you like your dinner? <br/>Cocktails...  Cocktails... [overlapping chatter] [overlapping chatter]  Probst: Heroes, congratulations once again. <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>Yes! <br/>Good job. <br/>No problem. <br/>Probst: For the third straight time, Heroes win immunity. No tribal Council. Everybody's safe. Villains, after 24 days, one of you going home tonight. You have the afternoon to figure out who it's going to be. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I will see you tonight at Tribal. <br/>Now, I don't even have to find idols. People are actually giving me idols. You don't hand the enemy the idol, especially when his name is Russell Hantz. You don't do that. You don't do that. That's a no-no. That's a no-no. [bird squawking]  Damn, we did it, and we got the idol out to Russell, and we know he's going  to be on our side. [sighing] Serves them damn Villains right. We'll make Survivorhistory with this one today, guys. <br/>I think so. <br/>Yeah. [Rupert laughing]  With Russell getting that hidden immunity idol, he's probably beaming with  excitement. Russell is probably having trouble containing himself right now. [Parvati laughing]  "Russell, read in complete privacy." [Parvati laughing] "This  is a huge turning point in this game. This is not fake. I wouldn't waste your time or mine. Hopefully, we are on the same page. Play the idol tonight."  For sure. <br/>"To save yourself..."  Save myself? <br/>Because clearly, you're on the outside of an all-devouring female alliance. <br/>Right. <br/>I put that part in myself. "All the girls should be writing your name down, so act like you know  you're going home." I can't believe he's writing all this, like...  He's telling me what to do. He's-He's giving me pointers. How do you give the idol king an idol? "Here, Mr. Russell. Here's an idol. This one's just for you." Well, thank you. You know what? I think J.T. just handed me one million dollars. Hey, I guess he can afford it. <br/>"I think you should write Parvati's name down and send her home."  [Parvati laughs] Why is everyone throwing me under the bus? They don't even know what's going on over here. Okay. "Our five plus you will remain strong till the girls are done  with."  "We can..."  "We can then work on getting ourselves in the final three."  Wow, wonder what that means. <br/>Big promises, J.T. <br/>Yeah. <br/>"Hopefully, I can trust you, and you're not truly a villain."  Yes, I am. <br/>"Let's do this together. See you soon." B.F.F., forever. [both giggling] X.O.X.O. <br/>Love you. <br/>"J.T. Destroy this right when you finish reading." [laughter] Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I can't believe he wrote you a letter. Why would you hand a villain your heart? J.T. gave Russell his heart today, and Russell is just going to stab it a million  times, a million times over, and hand it to me, and I'm going to eat it. [laughing] What are we, in fifth grade? He's passing notes? <br/>Wrote me a letter. <br/>What is wrong with him? Like, I cannot believe that kid Like, I cannot believe that kid won. won. <br/>Whatever. Ignore them. There's nothing we can do now. Well, this sucks, Sandra. I'm sorry. They're all in control, and we're now scrambling like cockroaches. <br/>Look, that's how I was in my season. I was al... We were always in control of everything. <br/>So was I on mine. And you know what? Tables turn. <br/>This is what we get for being bitches. Me and Courtney-- you know, our morale is really low 'cause it's inevitable  that me or Courtney are going home, and I'm really sad, because me without  Courtney-- that's like rice without beans, you know? So it's up to Danielle, Parvati and Russell who they're going to and Russell  who they're going to vote out. vote out. <br/>Yeah, Courtney. <br/>Simple? <br/>Simple. <br/>Parv? <br/>Parv? <br/>Yeah? <br/>Yeah? <br/>Done deal. <br/>Done deal. Now that we lost the challenge today, we can get rid of Courtney. I don't trust Courtney or Sandra. But I don't like Courtney, 'cause I think she'll flip. <br/>So are they gonna vote for me or Sandra? <br/>I don't know. I don't know what to do, because I wanted to keep you forever. You know? <br/>I know. I mean, the only thing I can say to you is that if we have five, and if I'm  there, Amanda is more likely to come with us. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Because she trusts me. Do you know what I mean? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>That's my only perk. 'Cause I would stay with you. Well, whatever. That's my argument for me. I'm not going to throw Sandra under the bus. I wouldn't vote for her, either. So I'm just going to vote for Jerri, I guess, and whatever happens, happens. <br/>Look, you would definitely stay with me? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Things are going to go crazy as soon as we merge, because it's five-five. As long as I know you'll stick with me, then I'll do what I can do to keep  you. <br/>I'm... I'm...  But you have to be with me. [laughter] Courtney and I have become really close, and, uh, I don't know. I want to keep Courtney here, because I feel like, once there's a merge, she  would stay more loyal to me than to more loyal to me than to Russell. Russell. I want to keep myself kind of lower key on this one, because if I try to save  her too much, people are going to think, "Oh, she has something on the  side with Courtney." [Parvati laughs]  They gave him their idol. <br/>J.T. gave me their idol to save me tonight. <br/>Shut up! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Are you dying? Are you dying? <br/>Shut up. <br/>Save yourself. <br/>He did not do that. <br/>They just think this girl thing is way too strong. <br/>They are so set on the girl thing, which is why I want to talk to you about  Courtney, because I think we need to keep because I think we need to keep  Courtney tonight. Courtney tonight. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I just think, Courtney would be more likely to stick with us than Sandra. Do you trust that you have Sandra's loyalty? <br/>I don't trust Courtney at all. I-I think she'll flip, and then all of a sudden...  I-I think Sandra will flip way before Courtney. <br/>All of a sudden, they have, uh...  And she's more strategic. <br/>I think they'll both flip, so it just comes down to who's more threatening...   All of a sudden, you got Amanda talking to you. <br/>...as far as who can talk better-- Sandra or Courtney? <br/>Sandra, and who makes up lies for no reason? <br/>I just think Courtney is way more likely to go flip-flop. <br/>But then you have to look at, like, if she gets to the end, Sandra would be  harder to beat than Courtney. <br/>Courtney would be easier to stick to...  To keep track of. <br/>To keep track of. <br/>To keep track of. <br/>For me. <br/>For me. <br/>I mean, it really doesn't matter one way or the other with me. <br/>I feel like I can keep Courtney in check more than I Courtney in check more  than I can keep Sandra. can keep Sandra. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the first member of our jury... Coach, voted out  at the last Coach, voted out at the last Tribal Council. Tribal Council. Sandra, at the last Tribal Council, trust was once again the big theme. Is that going to be the case again tonight? <br/>To me, it's like when I'm sitting in the living room in my house, whoever  Jeff asks the trust question to-- that's the last person that should be  answering that question. I'm in trouble. I know I am, because Tyson was in my alliance. He's gone. Boston Rob was in my alliance. He's gone. And today, it's between me and Courtney. One of us two is going. <br/>Probst: Is that right, Courtney? Is that what you think, as well? It's you or Sandra? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Russell, is there any correlation to the fact that Sandra and  Courtney are also the people who sit out, by far, the most often in  challenges? <br/>No, not to me. It's always that same question-- who can I trust the most? <br/>Probst: Danielle, what is it about Sandra and her trustworthiness or lack  thereof that has her name coming up tonight? <br/>That she's not in my alliance, and I've seen how she's playing the game, and  she's able to manipulate people. <br/>Probst: Give me an example. <br/>Yeah, me, too. Give me an example. <br/>Okay, um, I've seen you put into people's minds different things that maybe  weren't true just to stir the pot up. <br/>Probst: But Danielle, the question was trustworthiness, not big mouth. <br/>Well, that's kind of... She's just not been on my side. <br/>Probst: That's just not doing what you want her to do. <br/>Me and Boston Rob were together from the beginning, but then it comes down to  me, because now I'm the one left. <br/>No, no, no. Rob and you decided to not talk to me and pull in Courtney and Tyson, and I  had nowhere to go. So, what was I supposed to do? <br/>That didn't have nothing to do with Sandra. <br/>Yeah, but you were a part of it, and you didn't make me feel like...  Make you feel how, if you're running off with Parvati and Russell? Make you feel how? <br/>Well, you were running off...  Why should I come to you and say hello when you don't come and say hello to  me? <br/>You were Rob's, like, sidekick. Whatever Rob said to do, you went and did, and he said to watch...  And that's exactly what you do with Parvati. She's the boss, and you do whatever she...  But I trust them. I don't...  Okay, so there's no difference. <br/>She doesn't tell me to do anything. I'm my own person. <br/>And I'm my own person. Rob doesn't tell me what to do. <br/>Well, it sure didn't look like it. <br/>Probst: So, Parvati, are you the boss? <br/>Of course. If you ask the Heroes, I'm the boss. I'm running a crazy women's alliance over here. <br/>Probst: Parvati, what about Courtney is not trustworthy? <br/>For me, it's not about trustworthiness. It's about alliances. I mean, in the beginning of this game, there was a strong division-- Boston  Rob's girls versus Russell's girls-- and Rob's gone. <br/>I'll tell you what trust will do. We had a group of ten. We had three people that really trust each other-- me, Parvati and Danielle--  and we're still sitting here. That's what trust can do for you. If you really believe it, and if it's really true, you can make it all the  way to the end in this game. <br/>Probst: Courtney, that ring true to you? <br/>Yeah, there's a tight alliance that formed, and you can't hate on the three  of them. But you know, I stuck with Rob when I knew he was going to go, and so that  was, like, the beginning of the end for me and Sandra's side, which Jerri was  a part of and Coach was a part of, too, in the beginning and then it all went...   No, I never asked to be a part of that group, not once, so...  You didn't vote for Parvati? <br/>I was never in anybody's alliance, is my point...  All right, well you voted against the alliance you're a part of now, but you  flipped just in time to save your butt, so awesome for you. I didn't flip quick enough, I guess, and so, that's why me and Sandra are in  trouble. <br/>Probst: Well, the stakes are clearly high. Now, it's time to make your decision. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Sandra, you're up. Sandra, you're up. Sandra, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... First vote... Jerri. Jerri. Courtney. One vote-- Jerri, one vote-- Courtney. Courtney. Courtney. Courtney. Courtney. That's three votes-- Courtney, one vote-- Jerri. Tenth person voted out and the second member of our jury-- Courtney. That's four. That's enough. You need to bring me your You need to bring me your torch. torch. Courtney, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Good luck, bitches. See you later. <br/>Bye. <br/>Probst: Time for you to go. <br/>Bye, Courtney. <br/>Bye, Courtney. <br/>Bye. <br/>Bye. <br/>Probst: Well, time will tell if you made the right vote tonight, but here's  one thing for sure-- we are now even. Five Villains, five Heroes. One other note-- congratulations to Parvati. Tomorrow, you will join Amanda as the only people to have played 100 days in  the game of Survivor. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Grab your torches, head back to camp. head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor. <br/>This ought to be interesting. <br/>Probst: Five Heroes and Five Villains...  Probst: ...will collide. <br/>Probst: ...will collide. This is where I stand. This is where I stand. <br/>They think they have the game right now. <br/>Whatever Russell says, he's lying if he says that the women are running the  show. <br/>This is where the game gets  This is where the game gets crazy. crazy. <br/>I have to say that I am very proud of myself. This is pretty good for the little skinny chick to get all the way to the  jury. Good for me. It's actually one of my Survivor dreams to be on the jury and get all pretty  and make all the bitches jealous as they sit there in their dirty rags. I've been really lucky in both my Survivorexperiences, and there's nobody I  intensely hate. there's nobody I intensely hate. So, good luck everybody.
