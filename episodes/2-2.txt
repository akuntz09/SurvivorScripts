<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor: Two tribes were abandoned in  the middle of the Australian outback...  Amber: Ogakor. <br/>Maralyn: Ogakor. <br/>Michael: Kucha. <br/>Debb: We're Kucha? <br/>Jeff: ...and had to make a treacherous hike to find their  camps. <br/>Amber: I'm a little tired. This rice is very heavy. <br/>Jeff: But not everybody could stomach the trek. <br/>Jeff V.: All of a sudden I just got sort of nauseous, and  I kept thinking to myself, "I'm not going to get sick." [ retching  ]  Jeff: At Ogakor, tensions simmered between Keith and  Jerri. <br/>Jerri: I don't even really want to attempt to start a fire  until we get it where we want to keep it. <br/>Keith: I think we start the fire-- we take it where we  want to. <br/>Jerri: He might very well not even be aware of some of the  condescending remarks he made to me, but I'm not the kind of person to just  let it slide off my back. <br/>Jeff: At Kucha, there wasn't enough food to put in their  mouths...  Jeff V.: I'm looking at bugs. <br/>Jeff: ...but there was plenty of Kimmi's mouth to go  around. <br/>Kimmi: We was back-to-back, he farted in my... it  rebounded...  Jeff V.: Kimmi will not shut up. I just want to grab her by the neck and shake the ... out of  her. <br/>Jeff: Ogakor won the immunity challenge... The immunity  idol. ...so Kucha had to make the long hike to Tribal Council. Debb was the first person voted out. The tribe has spoken. 15 People left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Jeff V.: I saw Mike getting Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Jeff V.: I saw Mike getting up really early. The sun was just coming up. Everybody was asleep, and I woke up, and I saw Mike messing  around the fire and putting stuff on the pot, and I couldn't understand what  he was doing. And so as we were waking up, we realized he put rice on, and  nobody said anything about eating rice. Nobody said they were hungry. And he left. He just put the rice on, and he left. <br/>Alicia: Are you making rice? <br/>Jeff V.: Mike is. <br/>Alicia: Mike's making rice already? <br/>Jeff V.: I hope everybody's hungry. I'm not hungry at all. That was totally not cool. <br/>Alicia: No, I don't think that was good. When it comes to food, it has to be a group decision, since we  don't have much. Mike was hungry. That's why he did that. And that is another indication of Mike being Mike, about  himself. <br/>Michael: Everyday we've been having breakfast first thing  in the morning, and I got up, and I thought I was being really helpful, and I  cleaned the pot, and I boiled the water, and I made the rice, and I was going  to have a warm meal for everybody when they woke up. Dig in, let's go. <br/>Alicia: It's like rice porridge. <br/>Jeff V.: It cooked too long, and it was mashy and just  nasty. <br/>Kimmi: You know what? We could use this as the wallpaper glue to hold everything  together. <br/>Michael: It was odd that in fact it not only wasn't appreciated,  they didn't like it. <br/>Kimmi: Mike, baby, we love you, but you're not qualified. <br/>Michael: I think people are starting to get a little bit  edgy without food, and they don't realize how bad it's going to get. I'm a student of nutrition, and I know what this is doing to my  body. But these other people have no idea. If they did, they would be out fishing and hunting for food. But they don't. I guess maybe the way that I can convince them of the importance  of the food is by catching a lot of it and then feeling full one time and  seeing what happens to their body and how much energy they have. Maybe that's how I can convince them. <br/>Kel: Maralyn, I'm going to go out and check the trap. <br/>Maralyn: Okay. <br/>Mitchell: Kel is like the fisherman of the group. He's very persistent in that area, and part of me thinks it's  because he feels if he does catch a fish, that might, um, keep him here  longer. <br/>Maralyn: Good luck. <br/>Kel: Thank you. Thank you. <br/>Maralyn: There's a time to be energized, and there's a time  to just chill out. So we're going to the family whirlpool. [ laughter ]  Maralyn: This will feel so good. You'll be in ecstasy. [ indistinct chatter ]  Jerri: Look at us, just hanging out like we're on  vacation. This is great. <br/>Kel: Our food strategy right now is rice. I mean, rice is our staple. I don't see that rice lasting us more than ten days. We do need to get some fish out of this river. <br/>Keith: Our plan for getting food is, uh... We don't really  have a good plan, actually. No fish. Are we worried if there's no fish in the water? <br/>Colby: I'm not worried. <br/>Mitchell: There ain't no fish in this water, I'll tell you  that. I say stop wasting the energy on fishing. And I don't think there's any fish out there. [ laughs ]  Kel: We've got some great hooks that were in the crate. but I don't have any fishing line. And so what I've had to use is twine, and twine, um, is not as  great as fishing line-- it breaks, you have to weave it together to get  through the hole. The fish can see it, obviously, and plus the twine floats, so I  have to tie a rock to the twine to make the twine sink which makes it even  more noticeable to the fish. <br/>Colby: Kel's done a little bit of fishing which just, I  mean, come on, the guy couldn't fish a rubber ducky out of the bathtub. The bait choices, the-the lines... He's just going about it the  wrong way. <br/>Kel: So I've been trying to fish every day, and I've been  unsuccessful, but I'm not going to quit. I'm going to keep on doing it and doing it and doing it until I  can find a great fishing spot or a technique that works. <br/>Jerri: Believe me, when he goes out, I'm hoping more than  anybody that he's going to come back with some fish and some shrimp, and  he'll have a big seafood buffet. Any luck out there? <br/>Kel: No, but there are fish out there. I saw quite a few. <br/>JERRI But it's not happening. And it's... [ laughs ] He's just, he's not a fisherman,  obviously. He should keep his day job. [ laughing ]  Jeff V.: Oh, wow. <br/>Alicia: Whoa. This is big time. <br/>Jeff V.: It's a reward. <br/>Alicia: There we go. <br/>Jeff V.: "A leap of faith is not for the skilled. Just step off the edge, try not to get killed. Like Sundance and Butch..."  ALICIA [ gasps ]: We're jumping off a cliff. <br/>Jeff V.: "...you'll jump from a cliff. Count on your friends while you're set adrift."  Alicia: You guys? <br/>Jeff V.: We've got a big one. <br/>Alicia: Did anybody see Sundance? We get two blankets if we win. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my gosh. <br/>Alicia: Feel it. Two full-size blankets. <br/>Nick: How nice it'll be with blankets, man. <br/>Alicia: Oh, my God. We'll definitely sleep through the night if we have blankets. <br/>Kimmi: Everybody has to jump? <br/>Nick: You're jumping off a cliff, bad boy. <br/>Jeff V.: Can you jump off a cliff? <br/>Rodger: Into what? <br/>Jeff V.: Into water. <br/>Rodger: "Step off the edge"? That's-that's... that's going over something. And we're off the edge. <br/>Nick: Yeah, I'm psyched. <br/>Rodger: "And try not to get killed." Today's  challenge is, I believe, is probably going to be jumping off a cliff into  some water. Water is not mine finest... my uh, finest point, so, uh, I'm a  little apprehension. But, uh, I figure if the rest of them can do it, I can, too, so  I'm going to give it a shot. <br/>Jeff V.: We got his back. We got your back. Rodger is the only one that I'm a little iffy about. I think everybody else is going to go over it. But he can't swim. He can tread water, lightly. <br/>Rodger: I just, basically, learned to swim right before we  came out here. Plus I'm... I really got a little fear of heights, too. I mean, you're talking to a guy that wouldn't even ride the  Ferris wheel at the fairs, 'cause I just-just never did like heights. <br/>Jeff: What's up, guys? This is a reward challenge. It's called "Butch Cassidy" and you're playing for two  warm blankets. It is the rainy season. They're probably going to come in handy. The game is this: There are two crates, one for each tribe,  anchored out in the water below. Your challenge: Get your tribe's crate across the finish line at  the old miner's camp first. Winners keep the blankets that are sealed inside. One member from each tribe, on my start, is going to jump off  this cliff, they'll swim out and grab on to the crate. And then the next member will jump off and swim out. You can't jump until the person in front of you has touched the  crate. Once all the members from the tribe have arrived, you've got to  dive down, unhook the crate from its anchor, and then swim with it down the  river through the rapids and make your way up the beach. First tribe to get their crate onto the platform at the end wins  the challenge and the blankets. <br/>Alicia: Let's go, Kucha. [ indistinct conversations ] Just run and jump and work magic. <br/>Jeff: Survivors ready? Go! [ excited shouting, whooping ]  Jeff V.: Go, Mike! <br/>Mitchell: Go, go, go, go! [ indistinct shouting ]  Jeff V.: Go left, Mike. Go left. [ excited shouting ]  Alicia: Go! Go! <br/>Alicia: Go right, go right! <br/>Nick: Go right! <br/>Colby: That a way, Mitchell. Go, Mitch, go! <br/>Maralyn: Come on, Mitchell! <br/>Go! [ laughter ]  Oh, my God. <br/>Go...! [ excited shouting ] [ yelling ]  Good job! Go! Go! Go! <br/>Come on! Go! Go! Go! Go! [ excited shouting ]  Come on, Rodger! Let's go... [ indistinct shouting ] You can do it! <br/>Come on, Rodger. [ indistinct shouting ]  Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go [ excited shouting ]  Come on, Rodger! <br/>Come on, Rodger. You can do it. <br/>Come on, Rodger, you can do it! <br/>Come on, Rodger! <br/>Kimmi: You can do it, Rodger! <br/>Elisabeth: Let's go. Here we go. <br/>Jerri: Go! [ indistinct shouting ]  Kel: Go! <br/>Alicia: Come on, grab on. [ indistinct shouting ]  Alicia: Ready? Go. Come on, come on. <br/>Jeff V.: Did you get it? <br/>Nick: I got it. <br/>Jeff V.: Go! Go! <br/>Alicia: Go! Go! <br/>Good job. Pull! [ instinct shouting ]  Alicia: Nobody gives up. Nobody gives up. <br/>Elisabeth: Go, Kucha. <br/>Maralyn: Oh, my God. <br/>Elisabeth: Hang right! Hang right! [ indistinct shouting ] [ panting ]  Jeff V.: Under the bottom...  Alicia: Guys, get those...  Amber: Oh, the sand's so hot! [ indistinct talking ]  Michael: One, two, three. [ whooping ] [ panting, sighing ]  Amber: Good job, guys. <br/>Rodger: I'm glad that's over. <br/>Elisabeth: You've swam more than you've ever swum in your  life. <br/>Jeff: Guys, open that crate up-- blankets inside. You guys are on a hot streak. Two in a row. <br/>Jerri: I want to sleep one good night. <br/>Colby: Did you sleep good last night? <br/>Jerri: No. <br/>Colby: Neither did I. <br/>Maralyn: You know, all it takes is one small mound in the  ground to really screw with your body bad. [ scattered chuckling ]  Tina: You know, we're not getting eight hours' sleep. We're not getting, you know, but a handful of food a day. But, you know, this is the game we signed up to play. <br/>Keith: You guys hungry? <br/>Maralyn: Yes. <br/>Jerri: Are you cooking? <br/>Amber: Keith said he's a chef, but, and it's not that I  don't believe it-- he can't cook very well, you know? And I'm not doubting his talent. But I think it might be that he's adding, maybe, too much water  to the rice. <br/>Tina: It's pasty. It tastes like glue. It just... in your mouth it goes [ smacking ] It's just  horrible, and I can't eat it. <br/>It just... it didn't make sense. It didn't make sense. Like, how could a gourmet chef not know how to make rice? There's a bunch more things we can have than rice, and I'm ready  to start making some of them. I remembered that with flour and water you can create some sort  of dough. <br/>Keith: You know what we can do, while you're doing that? We're going to go get some more wood. <br/>Jerri: All right. <br/>Keith: So we'll be back in a little while. <br/>Jerri: Keith is very threatened by the fact that I made  this tortilla this morning. That's why... I heard them when they went up on the hill, and  they were gathering wood, he was talking, again, about what he's going to do  with the rice and the vegetables and this... You know, you just have to  laugh. You just have to laugh. [ giggling ]  Keith: So there's so much work to do as a team that, uh,  and it's hard, physical labor to come up here and grab all these big logs and  stuff and throw them down. So, if she wants to cook some tortillas for breakfast, I think  it's fantastic. Actually, it's a break for me, you know? No... [ chuckles ] no worries, mate. <br/>Jerri: I felt a little bit bad about it, but at the same  time, you know, I felt like it was time for somebody to come in and take  charge and change the food situation. Go ahead. Go ahead. <br/>Amber: Oh, my God. It is so good. <br/>Tina: Thank you. <br/>Jerri: Ah, you're welcome. <br/>Amber: I love it! I love it. <br/>Jerri: We will eat today. <br/>Amber: Slap me five. <br/>Tina: Jerri's going to take that job over, which I hope  doesn't hurt Keith's feelings. You know, I mean, that's his area, and it's kind of a slap in  the face. <br/>Kel: Thanks, Jerri. <br/>Jerri: Today's communion. <br/>Mitchell: Wow. <br/>Keith: Finest the restaurant in the world couldn't have  made those that nice. <br/>Jerri: Keith has gone out of his way to compliment me a  lot now, to, like, try and smooth the edges. And I see... I mean, I see right through it. I don't-I don't think his compliments are necessarily very  genuine. <br/>Keith: That is good. I'm so glad they put wheat in there. <br/>Colby: Thanks, Jerri. <br/>Jerri: You know, the morale right now is kind of low, but  I think the tortilla made everybody spark up, so I'm really stoked about  that. And I got a few other tricks to pull out of my sleeve. <br/>Michael: I want to bring food today. If I can keep providing food, I absolutely am sure I will make  the merger. If I can't, I become vulnerable. I've been thinking a lot about the fact that at Tribal Council  it came out that I was the leader, and I don't really want to be seen as the  leader. So if I can get something, I'll lay real low on the other  leadership areas and just be the food guy. <br/>Kimmi: We got fish! It looks like you just went to the fish market with all that  fish. <br/>Alicia: Look at that. Who's better than you right now? There's nobody I can think of. <br/>Jeff V.: When other people catch a fish, they just catch a  fish. But when Mike catches it, there are trumpets that blare and  angels that sing. And, you know, everybody's got to sit down and gather round him  and hold his hands and watch him carve it out. <br/>Michael: Ow. Here you go. <br/>Alicia: Wow! <br/>Michael: Dear God, you know I said a lot of prayers today,  and You answered them with fish for us. And I am so happy to be able to provide fish for the troops. I know that this could easily get turned around in some way to  make me be the leader of the tribe, but this meal is, from the bottom of my  heart, makes me so happy to be able to provide for everybody here. So... thanks for that. <br/>Nick: Amen. <br/>Alicia: Amen. <br/>Rodger: Good job. <br/>Kimmi: Mike thanked God for making him the leader of the  tribe. I don't know when he was anointed, but apparently, my back was  turned at that moment. <br/>Michael: Oh, my God. <br/>Rodger: Well, get you another bite. <br/>Michael: No, no, no. Take one bite and just keep passing them...  Rodger: Michael does like to be in the limelight. I don't think there's any doubt about that. But as long as Mike keeps delivering the food though, that's  going to be a hard one to knock off, you know. <br/>Alicia: He really thinks he is leader of this tribe. I'm telling you now that there are people in this tribe that  want to vote him off already. <br/>Maralyn: I am very disappointed at what happened five  minutes ago. Jerri reported to the rest of us that she had seen Kel chewing a  brown substance. What she thought was beef jerky. <br/>Jerri: And I saw him put something in his mouth and it was  like dark brown colored, shredded looking sort of thing. <br/>Mitchell: Jerri blatantly that said she saw something that  looked just like beef jerky go into his mouth. And I... I believe her, actually. <br/>Jerri: I guarantee it was. <br/>Amber: I saw him chewing, but you saw...  Colby: I saw him chewing, too. <br/>Jerri: I mean to have your own team member possibly be  holding food behind you and surviving on their own little private stash while  the rest of us are... starving basically is not a good way to start off on  the right foot with a bunch of strangers. Because to think that someone in our own tribe would be, you  know, sneaking in extra stuff, especially food. <br/>Mitchell: Well, if you're eating anything that we weren't  eating, then that's unfair to the rest of us. <br/>Tina: If he had beef jerky, I'd kill him dead. <br/>Maralyn: The pot starts to boil. While Kel was up on the hill, they rifled through his bag. <br/>Tina: You know, it was like a big feeding frenzy. You know, "Kel's got beef jerky." And they said,  "Look in his backpack real quick." And I was standing right there,  and I did it. And there wasn't anything in there at all. But still and yet, all I was thinking about, "If I find  beef jerky in here, it's going to be ugly."  Colby: He's snacking up there, I know it. [ scattered chuckling ]  Maralyn: Ouch. Within earshot of Kel, it was overheard, and Kel came back down. <br/>Keith: Hey, Kel. <br/>Kel: How you doing? <br/>Keith: Good. How are you? <br/>Kel: Good. Hey. Hey, guys? <br/>Maralyn: Did you find anything? <br/>Kel: How are you guys doing? <br/>Maralyn: Did you find anything? <br/>Kel: Just a second, just a second. How are you guys doing? Look, while I was going up there looking for bait for fishing,  you guys were talking about that you thought I was eating beef jerky... That  was a blade of grass, and I smooshed it up into my jaw, and I was chewing on  that. I was just chewing grass. <br/>Jerri: Well, in order to put grass in your mouth, you have  to go get grass first. And I don't think you get grass out of your pocket. <br/>Kel: Just chewing a piece...  Jerri: What kind of grass? <br/>Kel: Green grass. Just any kind of grass you can pick up. <br/>Amber: How do you know it's not poisonous? <br/>Kel: Uh, I mean, it looks... it looks like normal grass,  okay? It just looks like a normal blade of grass, so I mean...  Keith: We don't need you, uh, sick at these competitions. <br/>Kel: Well, I want to just make sure that you guys know  that. I'm really trying to be a part of this group. It's really important for me to try to assimilate. I may not be the most talkative one in here, I'm a fairly quiet  person...  Jerri: Mm...  Keith: Well, thanks for coming and telling us. <br/>Jerri: Yeah, we appreciate the explanation. <br/>Kel: No problem. <br/>Jerri: We're-we're just, you know, when someone's chewing  something and nobody else is and everybody's starving. <br/>Kel: Well, I just find it really comical that you would  think I would do that. <br/>Maralyn: I think it's pretty comical...  Kel: I think it's... I think it's comical myself. [ scattered chuckling ] And that also brings up another point--  I was going to do this later on tonight. I know during the competition, you guys were talking about your  faces were getting scruffy, and the girls were talking about wanting to shave  their legs. I've got three blades out here. The girls can use one blade, the guys can use the other blade. I have no problem with that whatsoever. <br/>Jerri: He suddenly, at that point, offered his razor. And I think that that's the hugest sign of guilt is to give to  the people who have just accused you of something that is very serious. <br/>Jerri: I will totally take you up on that. That's very gracious of you, actually. <br/>Kel: No problem. Sorry for the awkward moment. I will now leave you guys in peace, and I'll go in my boat and  try finding some kind of fish with the bait I have. <br/>Maralyn: I suggested to them all, "Hey, what you all  did was totally inappropriate. It was wrong. Nobody had any right to go into Kel's bag." I said,  "Don't you think that it would be in the best interest of the team to be  big enough to apologize to him?" Without real proof, it would be very  big of us to apologize. <br/>Jerri: No. <br/>Maralyn: Okay. They said, "No. No." [ laughter ]  Jerri: I think-I think Maralyn is kind of upset at us. <br/>Maralyn: Gee whiz, four days, things are heating up at our  encampment. <br/>Nick: It's on a bone. <br/>Alicia: Oh, boy. <br/>Nick: "Want to try a new dish? Take care what you wish. Next challenge may go too far. Just say 'Rub-A-Dub-Dub,' thank God for the grub. Close your eyes, plug your nose and swallow hard." We're  eating...  Alicia: We're eating bugs. <br/>Nick: We're eating something crazy. <br/>Alicia: We got this one. We're eating bugs. <br/>Nick: We're eating something. <br/>Elisabeth: We should have just been really hungry this  morning. <br/>Michael: Food is food, right? <br/>Kimmi: What kind of bug? <br/>Michael: It's a worm. <br/>Alicia: It's grub. <br/>Jeff V.: It's grub. It's a worm. <br/>Nick: You guys want to hear it? <br/>Alicia: You guys ready to hear this? It's on a bone. <br/>Kimmi: Our immunity challenge came to us and it's  something about rub-a-dub-dub, we're eating a grub or something. [ disgusted grunt ] Let me go last. I'm a vegetarian, which means I don't eat land-dwelling animals. I'm not going to compromise my, you know, situation, um, now. <br/>I'm not eating amphibian. I'm not eating reptile. I'm not eating mammal. I'm not eating foul. <br/>Alicia: Kimmi's not going to compromise her morals, but  coming into a game like this, you can't come in with a whole list of things  you're not going to do and you're not going to eat because you're not helping  your tribe, you're not helping your team morale. [ disgusted groan ]  Michael: If Rodger can jump off a cliff and swim that long  distance and down the rapids with never having swum before, I think Kimmi  should be able to reach down and be able to do this. <br/>Jeff V.: Oh, my God. <br/>Kimmi: You know what? I can't do it, and I'm disappointing six people that are rooting  for me. Now, you know, I have no excuse for-for not being, um, voted off  the island. I could be gone, just like that. <br/>Jeff: I'll take the immunity I could be gone, just like  that. <br/>Jeff: I'll take the immunity idol. It's back up for grabs. I'll explain the game. I know you guys are hungry so we've put together one of the  finest samplings of true Aboriginal food, what they call bush tucker. As you guys know, the Aboriginals have lived out here for  thousands of years, literally by eating everything. Nothing goes to waste. Here's how it's going to work. One member from each tribe will come up. I'll spin the wheel, and you'll eat what's on here. Also on the wheel, some treats that might go down a little  easier. If you're lucky, maybe you'll get the fruit or the candy bar. Since Kucha is short one member, one of your members will have  to eat twice. So whoever you select to go first, will also eat last. Now if you pass, and you don't eat or you can't finish, you lose  a point. At the end of one round, whoever has the most points get the  immunity idol. Losers lose another member at tomorrow night's Tribal Council. Going down and coming back up doesn't count. It's got to stay down. And the way you know is you show me your mouth. I look in, I don't see anything, I'll say good to go. This the mangrove worm. It lives in little mangrove trees. It usually burrows a small hole in its infancy stage, and then  as it grows, the hole gets deeper and deeper and deeper, sort of like a  termite. What are you taking out? <br/>Maralyn: I'm ready. <br/>Jeff: You're taking out your teeth. [ scattered chuckling ] Mad Dog has just taken out her teeth. <br/>Michael: Oh, my God. Jeff: Here we go, guys. Three, two, one. You're on. <br/>Amber: Go, Maralyn. <br/>Jeff: Let's see. Good. [ Maralyn choking ]  Kel: Come on, Maralyn. <br/>Jerri: You can do it. You can do it. It's an oyster. It's an oyster. <br/>Jeff: Got a bucket if you need it, Maralyn. <br/>Maralyn: Water? <br/>Jerri: You got it. [ Maralyn choking ] It's all right. [ Maralyn puffing ]  Jerri: Yeah! [ whooping ]  Maralyn: Oh! <br/>Jeff: Next two. [ Kimmi yells ]  Kimmi: Brain. <br/>Jeff: You got cow brain there. The good news is it's pretty fresh. It should have a nice taste to it. You guys ready for this? <br/>Keith: Sure. <br/>Jeff: Three, two, one. We're on. <br/>Kimmi: I can't. I can't eat a brain. <br/>Keith: Can we have some to take back to camp with us? <br/>Mitchell: Yeah, Keith. <br/>Amber: You are the man. <br/>Mitchell: You the man. <br/>Kimmi: I can't do it. <br/>Jeff: Taking a pass, Kimmi? <br/>Kimmi: It's a mammal. I can't do it. Sorry. <br/>Jeff: Okay. Let's see your mouth. You're good. Ogakor is one up. <br/>Amber: Yeah, Keith. Next two. That's mud whelk. It's the shellfish you find seaside. Three, two, one. We're on. <br/>Amber: Oh, that's nice. <br/>Colby: Atta-girl. <br/>Amber: That's it. <br/>Colby: Just swallow it. <br/>Nick: You've got to savor it. <br/>Jeff: Kind of crunchy, huh, Jerri? <br/>Jerri: Mmm. <br/>Jeff V.: Let's get that thing down, Nick. <br/>Alicia: Yeah, yeah. No, no, no, hold it, hold it, hold it. Hold it. <br/>Jeff: I'll give you five seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. <br/>Amber: Come on, Jerri. <br/>Jeff: Look at that. [ Jerri screams happily ]  Maralyn: All right! [ Maralyn yells happily ]  Jeff: Next two. Kel and Elisabeth. You got the apple. <br/>Maralyn: Wow! <br/>Kel: Yeah! Yeah! <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God. [ scattered chuckles ]  Jeff: Next two. <br/>Maralyn: Whatever it is, you got it. <br/>Jeff: That is witchety grub larva. This will become a moth. It's in its early stages. Ogakor you got a lead. Three, two, one. <br/>Jerri: Go. Come on, Mitchell. Go, Mitchell, go, Mitchell. [ laughing and cheering ]  Keith: Way to go, all right! <br/>Jeff: Here we go. <br/>Jerri: You can do it, Amber. <br/>Alicia: Ah! You suck. <br/>Jeff: The pincers, you can break off. Everything else, you're eating. Three, two, one. <br/>Tina: Eat it little by little, if you have to. [ indistinct talking ]  Colby: There you go. All right. <br/>Chips. Potato chips. Ranch potato chips. [ indistinct talking ]  Jerri: You got it. <br/>Colby: Okay, you got it. <br/>Rodger: Swallow, swallow. <br/>Jeff V.: Yeah! <br/>Maralyn: Don't... don't think about what's going through  your head right now. It's a mental picture. [ cheering ]  Keith: All right. [ cheering ]  Colby: Yeah! [ indistinct talking ]  Jeff: Here we go, guys. <br/>COLBY Big bucks, big bucks. No whammies. Ooh. Get past that. [ cheering ]  Jeff: It's a candy bar. Life is working for you guys. <br/>Mitchell: Go ahead, man. Enjoy it. We're with you in spirit. <br/>Jeff: Last two. Tina, Michael, you're up again. Here's where we're at. Kimmi passed, therefore, Kucha is down one point. Tina, if you swallow this last one, your team wins immunity. But if you don't and Michael swallows his, we have a tie. This is it, for immunity. <br/>Perfect. Yeah. <br/>Jeff: You got tripe, a cow's stomach lining. <br/>Amber: Oh, Tina, that's the best one. <br/>Jerri: Steak. That's a steak. <br/>Amber: That's a steak. <br/>Rodger: That's a sirloin. <br/>Jeff: Three, two, one. We're on. <br/>Jerri: Prime rib, baby. Prime rib. Prime rib, prime rib. <br/>Jeff: It's chewier than you would expect. <br/>Jerri: It's prime rib. [ indistinct talking ]  Kel: It's okay, Tina. <br/>Jeff: Okay? <br/>Jerri: You're good, Tina, you're good. [ gagging sound ]  You're getting protein. [ gagging sound ]  Nick: Slimy cow...  Amber: Cover your mouth. <br/>Jeff: You got a bucket, you got a bucket. It came up. <br/>Nick: It came up. [ Tina retching ]  It's all right. No thing, no big thing. <br/>Tina: Oh, sorry, guys. [ cheering ]  Jeff: All right, guys, here's how the tiebreaker is going  to work. Ogakor, you select a member from Kucha. Kucha, you select your member from Ogakor. <br/>Alicia: Tina's up. <br/>Jeff: Tina? <br/>Alicia: Tina's up. <br/>Jeff: Right here, Kimmi? <br/>Kimmi. <br/>Jeff: Kimmi. Your challenge is going to be to take a whole mangrove worm. <br/>Alicia: This is all you, girl. <br/>Jeff: The first person to completely swallow it, show me  their mouth, that it's empty, wins. [ all talking at once ]  Kimmi: I can eat a worm. I can eat a worm. I can eat a worm. <br/>Jeff: Three, two, one. Go. <br/>Alicia: Swallow the whole thing. <br/>Pick it up. <br/>Tina: She dropped it. <br/>Eat it, eat it. <br/>You got it. [ all talking at once ] [ cheering ]  Jeff: Kimmi, come here. Immunity for Kucha. [ cheering ]  Tina: I'll definitely feel [ cheering ]  Tina: I'll definitely feel bad about having to vote  somebody off. There's some humiliation involved with being the first one voted  off. <br/>You know, it's a bittersweet opportunity. Actually, it's a bitter opportunity. There is no sweetness to it. We have to eliminate a person within our group. It could be me. I mean, it really could be me. For all I know, I could be the individual going. <br/>Mitchell: Keith is, um, he's a bit bossy. He's very condescending, and he's definitely... close to going. <br/>Colby: If you were looking to paint a bull's-eye on  someone, obviously Keith has struck a nerve in a few people. But also Jerri. She's certainly, um, a very strong girl and very set in her  ways. <br/>Jerri: Really? <br/>Colby: And sometimes a little unforgiving in certain  areas. <br/>Jerri: No, no, no, no. We're going to talk right now. <br/>Colby: So that kind of makes her a point of friction to  some people. <br/>Maralyn: Some things that, uh, that she's done have really  made me... me bristle. [ Jerri laughing ]  Kel: At this point I'm going to vote for Jerri. And the reason why I'm going to vote for Jerri is because I've  already told Maralyn that I was going to do that, and I'm not going to break  my word. And Maralyn told me she was going to vote for Jerri, too. And I trust Maralyn. <br/>Jerri: I think Kel is a liar and a cheat. As much as I don't want to believe that to be the truth, he  would probably be the first one I would want to vote off. <br/>Amber: I'm ready to go. <br/>Mitchell: I think the name of the game is trust no one. I don't think you could trust your own grandparents out here. I mean, I think I would vote them right off just 'cause they've  been married for 50 years. That's a good alliance. <br/>Keith: This game is all about deceit, deception and how to  play using your mind to win. <br/>Jeff: All right, guys, we begin Tribal Council with a  ritual. I would like you to go ahead and grab a torch... and approach the  flame. Dip your torches in, and once they're lit, you can put them back  in their slot. We do this because fire does represent life. These torches will now represent your life, your identity at  Tribal Council. I haven't had a chance to talk to you guys at Tribal Council  yet, so just a few questions before we get to the vote. You have fire. You have a professional chef. You guys should be eating very well. <br/>Keith: You know what, until we start really sourcing great  products to work with, our creative juices are semi-limited and stuff. But we realized earlier we had flour, and Jerri is a phenomenal  cook, so she steps in and she's made tortillas. We've had those for breakfast every morning. When we're done, we have Jerri's tortillas shop opening up. <br/>Jeff: Why are you cooking if he's the chef? [ Jerri sighs ]  Jerri: I knew you were going to go there. [ laughs ] The rice was a little pasty the first couple of  nights, and it got to the point where none of us wanted to eat it, and that's  when I felt I needed to step in because we were losing strength. Our morale was down. I mean, when you don't want to even eat, that's a really bad  sign of bad things to come. So I just took it upon myself. <br/>Jeff: Colby, what was your reaction to Keith's food? <br/>Colby: Oh, I had no problem with it. Rice is rice, man. <br/>Maralyn: Jeff... if it-if it goes down and doesn't come  back up, it's a good meal. <br/>Kel: Exactly. <br/>Jeff: That's what we found out yesterday. [ Amber and Jerri groaning ] Tina, what's been your lowest low? <br/>Tina: Probably throwing up that intestines that I ate and  feeling like I let my team down. <br/>Jeff: So let me ask you the question that is most on my  mind: Do you feel like you need to say, "I know I screwed up, but guys,  here's why you should keep me"? <br/>Tina: Absolutely not. I feel like I-I'm the one who screwed up, I should be the one to  go. <br/>Jeff: Having said that, it is time to vote. Jerri, you're first. <br/>Nothing against you, Jerri, but I already promised Tina  and Maralyn that I would not vote against them, and I would vote for you. I made this on day one, and I don't break my promises. Sorry about that, Jerri. <br/>Mitchell: As much as we could use your strength in our  challenges, we're a little sick and tired of some of your games. The only comfort I have in voting this way is the fact that you  brought this on all by yourself. I'm sorry. <br/>Maralyn: Kel. I'm sorry. <br/>Maralyn: Kel. Kel, if you were lying in the Simpson Desert, dying of thirst,  every single one of us would give you a drink of water. Good luck to you. <br/>Jeff: Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final. The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area along  this bridge. The first vote... Kel. Jerri. Kel. That's three votes for Kel, one for Jerri. Four votes Kel. The first person voted out of the Ogakor tribe... Kel. Kel, I need you to bring your torch. Kel, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Well, you survived Tribal Council number one. You have a long walk home. Go ahead and grab your torches and head back to camp. See you tomorrow. <br/>Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. Next time on Survivor: Jerri makes her move on Colby. <br/>Jerri: He's a cowboy, and I'm such a sucker for cowboys. [ Cobly moans ]  Colby: Just two school kids on the playground having fun. <br/>At Kucha, Michael is obsessed with making a kill...  Michael: This is a pig killer. <br/>...causing tempers to flare. <br/>That stupid spear. That's classic Mike. He's an idiot. [ Michael laughing ]  Kel: I knew right from day one that it was going to be  hard for me to fit in. I'm a military guy, and the people I was working with are very  unique special type of people. It was going to be very hard for me to fit into that mixture. I tried, I really did. But I don't think in a couple of days I could have overcome our  differences. Good luck. You're all winners to me.
