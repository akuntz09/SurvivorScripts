<br/>Jeff Probst: Deep in the heart of the South Pacific lies one of the most  mysterious and isolated islands in the world, Samoa. A land that's steep, volcanic mountains, towering waterfalls, fierce  rainstorms. Rugged coastlines, virtually untouched by civilization. And surrounded by an ocean that's home to a diverse marine life. Here's where these 20 Americans are beginning the adventure of a lifetime. Though they've not yet spoken, first impressions are already forming. <br/>This lady with her free[1]flowing  mullet, she's probably some super outdoors woman that will naturally step  forward as our leader. <br/>Dude, I'm a people magnet. People have gravitated to me my entire life. It's like, "Ooh, my God! This chick rocks! We love her."  There's a guy who looks as tough as nails. He looks like a pit bull. He's like... I wouldn't want to mess with him, that's for sure. <br/>I plan on making it as miserable as possible, making it hell for everybody to  get what I want. <br/>When I first started being a police officer, I believed every single person I  met. But now, I don't believe anybody anymore. <br/>Probst: 20 strangers forced to work together while battling the elements and  each other. They must learn to adapt or they'll be voted out. In the end, only one will remain to claim the remain to claim the  million-dollar prize. million-dollar prize. 39 days, 20 people, one 39 days, 20 people, one survivor. survivor. <br/>Probst: Welcome to Survivor: Samoa. You guys have already been divided into two tribes-- wearing purple, you are  Galu; wearing yellow, you are Foa Foa. You are now going to make your first tribe decision. You are going to elect a leader for your tribe. Out here in Samoa, the leaders, or matais as they're called, are held in very  high esteem because they're called upon to protect the interests of their  tribe. Whoever you elect is going to do that for your tribe. It's going to be based on body language, observations. A piece of parchment and a pen for each of you. Do your best to describe who looks like they could lead your tribe. <br/>It's like, "Ah! Kind of like a deer in headlights." Taking on a leadership role in a  game like Survivoris a death wish. <br/>Probst: Once you have it, you can head back to your mat. <br/>I do have leadership qualities. Being in the operating room, you have to make snap decisions. It takes more than a note from Mom to get through med school and residency. <br/>Probst: All right, Galu, who looks like they could lead your tribe? <br/>I voted for the guy in the gray shirt with the very short cut. <br/>Probst: What's your name? <br/>Erik. <br/>Probst: First vote is for Erik. Guy in the back. <br/>I voted for the lady with the purple bandanna. <br/>Probst: What's your name? <br/>Shambo. <br/>Probst: Shambo? <br/>Yup. My nickname has been Shambo since '86. I was in the United States Marine Corps, and Rambo had the same bandanna I  had. So everybody was like, Shannon, Shambo, Rambo, Shambo, so that's my game  name, and that's what I'm here to do, is play. <br/>Probst: All right, woman in front with the blond hair. <br/>Black jacket and dreads right here. <br/>What's your name? <br/>Russell. <br/>That's one vote for Russell. In the back. <br/>I voted for the guy with the dreadlocks-- Russell. <br/>Probst: Two votes for Russell  Handsome man in the suit. <br/>Probst: All right, that's three votes Russell. Russell, who did you vote for? <br/>Shambo. <br/>Probst: Shambo. So Russell has three votes, Shambo has two. Woman here in front in gray. <br/>Shambo. <br/>Guy in the back? <br/>Russell. <br/>Probst: That's four for Russell, Three for Shambo. Erik. <br/>Yeah, better looking Lennox Lewis. <br/>Probst: That's five for Russell, that will do it. Shambo has the last vote. <br/>This fellow. <br/>Probst: All right. Russell is the leader of Galu. All right. Foa Foa, your turn. <br/>Red shirt, jeans, khaki jacket. <br/>Probst: What's your name? <br/>Mick. <br/>Probst: Tall guy in the back. <br/>Mick. <br/>Probst: Mick. That's two for Mick. Right up here in the front with the cap. <br/>Girl in the orange shirt with white flowers. <br/>Probst: What's your name? <br/>Marisa. <br/>Probst: Brought a smile to your face. That's two for Mick, one for Marisa. Mick. <br/>The yellow shirt and vest. <br/>Probst: What's your name? <br/>Jaison. <br/>Probst: All right. Right here in the front, in the yellow dress. <br/>The guy in the khaki jacket and orange shirt. <br/>Probst: That's three for Mick. Jaison, who'd you vote for? <br/>The girl with the dark hair, Asian. <br/>The name is Liz. <br/>Probst: All right, Marisa, who did you vote for? <br/>Short, strong guy with the hat. <br/>Probst: Short, strong guy-- what's your name? <br/>Russell. <br/>Probst: Woman in front. <br/>Male, gray vest, yellow button up-- Jaison. <br/>Probst: Down here on the end. <br/>The tall, nicely dressed, Yale-type black man. <br/>Probst: All right, we have a tie, now. We have Mick with three votes, Jaison with three votes. Jaison with three votes. One vote left. One vote left. Last vote, hold it up. <br/>Guy with green jacket, red shirt, Mick. <br/>Probst: That's it. We have a leader for Foa Foa. It is Mick. <br/>I really wasn't surprised I wasn't written down as the leader, but I don't  really see anybody else that's a country boy. I've shot and killed and cleaned about everything you're allowed to in  Missouri, and probably a few things you're not. So I've done all this stuff before, and I think a lot of these people are  kind of candy asses. <br/>Probst: All right, leaders, now, you're going to make your first big decision. And it will test your leadership skills right from the start. <br/>I'm scared. This leadership thing can go south real quick. The highest nail definitely gets pounded down in this game. And right now, I'm, like, sky And right now, I'm, like, sky high. high. <br/>Probst: All right, you're now going to make your first big decisions as  leaders. You're going to decide who's going to participate in our opening challenge. Mick, I want you to choose from your tribe who you think is your best swimmer. your best swimmer. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. Jaison. He looks like a swimmer. <br/>Everybody assumes that tall, black guy can't swim, so I didn't think in a  hundred years that Mick would choose me for the swimming. But I played water polo through college and the national team, so I would  like to claim I'm a pretty good swimmer. <br/>Probst: Russell, who do you think is your best swimmer? <br/>I'm choosing the young, Brazilian-looking guy. <br/>Probst: John, head on over. Mick, pick the strongest person on your tribe. <br/>I'm choosing Russell. <br/>Probst: Russell. All right, for Galu. <br/>I'm going to choose the younger guy with the short[1]cropped  haircut. <br/>Probst: Erik? <br/>Erik. <br/>Probst: Mick, pick who you think is your most agile person. <br/>I'm choosing Marissa? <br/>Marisa. <br/>Marisa. <br/>Probst: All right, Russell. <br/>I'm choosing my African queen with braids. <br/>Probst: All right, Yasmin, come on over. Yasmin wearing nice heels. All right, Mick, last choice. Pick the smartest person on this tribe. <br/>This is tough. I am choosing the woman on the end. I'm sorry, I lost your name. <br/>Liz. <br/>I forgot. <br/>Probst: Liz. <br/>I think Mick chose me because I'm Asian, and while I certainly don't take  offense to the positive attributes of being an Asian, because they're smart,  they're supposed to be studious. <br/>Probst: Come on over. Join your tribe. <br/>There are also negative attributes like sneaky, conniving, and I just don't  want people attributing all the negative attributes to me. <br/>Probst: All right, Russell, who do you think is the smartest? <br/>I'm choosing Shambo! <br/>Oh, my God! I am smart in the ways of life, but as far as book smart, dear, God, please,  help me here. <br/>Probst: Come on over. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to the first challenge? Here's how it's going to work. On my "go," the designated swimmer will swim out, retrieve a key,  and swim back. The designated strong person will use that key to unlock a chain, freeing up  two very heavy bundles of logs. You'll then carry those logs back to the mat where the most agile person will  use those logs to get up to a balance beam. You must maneuver across the balance beam while navigating another key  through a rope maze. The designated smart person will use that key to unlock a bag of puzzle  pieces, using the pieces to solve the puzzle. First tribe to solve the puzzle wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Fire, in the form of flint. <br/>Let's get it, guys. <br/>Probst: Huge advantage to start this game. Take your spots, we'll get Take your spots, we'll get started. started. All right, here we go. All right, here we go. Survivors ready? Survivors ready? Go! The first leg is a swimming leg. Wow, two sprinters through the water. Got to swim all the way out, retrieve the key, and get back. Jaison starting to pull away from John. Mick feeling very good about his choice for a swimmer. <br/>Jaison, he surprised the [bleep] out of me. Afro-Americans aren't known to be... swimmers, you know. <br/>Jaison! <br/>All right, come on, baby! <br/>Come on, get it done! Get it done! <br/>Probst: John now at his key. [cheers] Jaison has his key and he's heading back. John has his key. He's heading back. We've got a race. <br/>Push it! Push it! Push it! <br/>Come on, John! <br/>Come on, John! Keep going! Keep going! <br/>Jaison first back for Foa Foa, passes off the key to Russell. Now the strong guy going to work. Got to unlock that chain. That is a long swim. <br/>John shanked that swim so bad I was ready to vote him off right there. <br/>Come on, keep going! <br/>Probst: Erik has the key. Erik now getting to work. [cheering] Russell having no problem with that first bundle of logs. [cheering] Erik trying to make up some time. <br/>Come on, Erik! <br/>Probst: Erik now has that first bundle. [Erik yells] Adrenaline coursing through that body! <br/>Push it, baby! You got it! You got it! You got it! All right, get back that other one. Look at him-- he's strong but he's tired! He's out of shape! <br/>Probst: Russell having a little trouble with that second one. These are heavy bundles of logs. [cheering] Erik carrying it. <br/>Come on, Erik! <br/>Come on, Erik, come on! <br/>Probst: Erik down. Russell has it. [Russell groans] Marisa's on the balance beam now. Got to make your way across the beam while maneuvering that key through the  rope maze. <br/>There you go. <br/>Probst: Erik still working with that second log. Step by step. <br/>Dig it in, baby, dig it in! <br/>Probst: Erik not giving up! [Erik screaming]  Finish it, finish it! Finish it! Finish it! Finish it! <br/>Probst: Erik has it! <br/>Look at how Erik carried that weight. He made me so proud. He had the heart of a tiger. <br/>Probst: Yasmin making up a lot of ground for Galu. <br/>That's what I'm talking about. <br/>You got it, girl, you got it. <br/>Probst: Marisa very close for Foa Foa. <br/>Good job! Get to that bit! Get to that bit! <br/>Probst: Marisa finishes. Liz now unlocks the lock. <br/>Don't quit. Take your time. <br/>Probst: Liz working on the puzzle for Foa Foa. <br/>Come on. <br/>Bring it to me, baby, bring it to me. <br/>There you go. <br/>Probst: There it is. Yasmin has it. Shambo now unlocking the puzzle pieces. <br/>Come on, Shambo. You can still take it, baby. You're in it. You're in it. You're in it. It ain't over. <br/>Probst: Liz has had a nice head start. Shambo is right in it. She was worried if she was going to be smart enough. <br/>Come on, come on! <br/>Probst: Shambo making up a lot of time. Shambo making up a ton of time for Galu. Liz very close. Foa Foa wins reward! Foa Foa wins reward! [cheering] [cheering]  We won the challenge because Mick made a very good choice on all legs. <br/>That was amazing. You owned it. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa, your reward. Fire and a map to your new home. Russell, at all frustrated? <br/>No, Jeff. I'm proud of this team. I am not frustrated in the least. <br/>Everybody loves an underdog, Jeff. <br/>That's right. <br/>Probst: You are definitely the underdogs. Here's your map to your new home. Grab your stuff. Head out. You've got a camp to build. <br/>Pretty boy. Maybe he couldn't swim, but get your ass off the mat. Stand up. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He doesn't deserve to be here. He doesn't deserve to be here. He doesn't deserve to be here. [indistinct chatter]  Oh! <br/>I'm Betsy. <br/>Mike. <br/>Mike. <br/>How you doing? <br/>Leader. <br/>What do we do now? <br/>Well, does anybody have any, like, practical, real world experience? <br/>I'm a hillbilly, man. <br/>Really? <br/>I've done this lots of times. The bathroom should definitely not be up from camp. It should be away. <br/>Ben's an interesting cat. You know, he shows up to camp and, I mean, the guy is just, like, "All  eyes to me."  We just need four holes that are, like, equidistant apart, like...  I can dig, I can dig holes. <br/>...ten by ten, 12 by 12, whatever it is. <br/>I think the leadership thing is difficult and I'm still trying to sort out  exactly how to run it. <br/>Put that other piece of bamboo that way. <br/>If he wants to step up and take control of things, you know what? Have at it, my friend, because Have at it, my friend, because he'll paint his  own target. he'll paint his own target. <br/>I didn't come here to work, I came here to play. You got to talk about alliance as soon as you step on this island, so my  strategy is to be able to have a secret alliance with each one of these dumb  girls. We can have something like a secret alliance. <br/>Okay. <br/>Hmm? <br/>So we can be strong from the beginning. We can look back at this moment right now... [Ashley laughs] ...and say,  "We did it from the beginning, from day one."  Right. <br/>It is day one now. I've got an alliance with the dumb, short-haired blonde. <br/>This is what I wanted. <br/>Pinky swear? <br/>I wanted someone to approach me. <br/>And the even dumber long[1]haired  blonde. <br/>I'll trust you. So do I have that same trust with you? <br/>Yes. <br/>And the dark-haired girl...  You've got my word. <br/>You have mine. <br/>I like to call it my dumb[1]ass  girl alliance. It's just gonna be me and you. <br/>All right. <br/>I told them exactly the same thing. This is real. <br/>I believe you. <br/>Not joking. And I believe they're just gullible enough to believe it. I know this ... before I even got here. Align with the old lady. [Betsy laughs]  You suck. <br/>To make sure that I win this game, my fourth alliance is with the old lady. I know she's a lot smarter than my dumb-ass girl alliance, so I've got to be  real careful with that one. <br/>Should we shake? Should we let people see us shake or what? That is fun, Russell. As a police officer, I usually can get a pretty good read on somebody by  talking to them, looking in their eyes, their body language. I just have a feeling that I don't trust Russell because he came to me too  quick in the game. I did make an alliance with him, I did make an alliance with him, but I don't  trust him. but I don't trust him. <br/>Galu! Welcome home, guys! [cheering and applause]  Home, sweet home. <br/>Oh, my God. So, listen to this. Let's make our structure. I've been elected leader of the Galu tribe. It is a heavy, heavy liability. Who's the one that you always want to get when you don't know who you want to  get? Get the leader. This is almost like we're building a raft. Let's think about a raft, right, on the ground, right, and then we're going  to raise the raft up. <br/>That sounds great. <br/>So, make sense? Let's get it done. <br/>When we first landed on the beach, I saw Russell, our tribe leader, begin to  actually take charge. It was really cool. I felt, "Yay, we do have a leader."  I just want to do some building. <br/>Ow. <br/>You're going to make this load bearing? The tree isn't vertical, so it isn't compressed through the core. <br/>Oh, my God. They're still discussing it. My only problem right now is we have some really strong, male, dominant  personalities that aren't hearing one another. <br/>I mean, can we go higher than this potentially? I mean...  Yeah, there is no limitation. <br/>This isn't necessarily like a hard stop line...  No, no. <br/>There's no reason we couldn't...  Yeah, exactly. I'm just sweeping this...  ...go up here and then two stacks, like five and then five. <br/>They got all hung up on exactly what should be done, how, when, where. <br/>If we're going to sleep here, right, and then build a trench... and all the  drain-- all the water that runs off this hill, which was part of the initial  rationale for picking this spot, right, gets diverted around us. In my life experience, a little bit of planning has taught me don't always be  so quick to start spinning the wheels. Raw destruction. Everyone's in a hurry right now. <br/>I know. <br/>We've got all day. This isn't your typical construction job. You can't push your schedule to the right, come in late, and deliver over  budget, because guess what. Your budget is coconuts. <br/>Should we start...? <br/>I think we-- it might be suited to take, like, a five[1]minute  break and just really think about what we're doing here. <br/>Oh, my God, these guys are killing me. John is very much all talk, no business. I think he's an engineer or something. He's, he's too technical. <br/>I think wind needs to be addressed. I think rain is your biggest adversary. <br/>All he's doing is running his mouth. <br/>I'm trying to kind of get an, get an inventory of all the actions that we  need to have completed or at least try. <br/>I think we ought to just act and quit freaking thinking. <br/>Okay. <br/>Ooh, Lord have mercy. <br/>I'm tired. <br/>I'm going to go get wet. <br/>Yeah, yeah, let's go. <br/>Yeah, because I'm vile. [laughter]  Oh, these young kids. I didn't want to go in the damn water. It's crazy, because I have to constantly remind myself, this is not the  Marine Corps, and all these people are in their mid[1]20s,  so the way that the rest of the tribe does things is going to be way  different than the way that I do things. So Russell as leader-- I-I'm struggling with it. He's not being assertive. He's not leading right now, in my opinion. He needs to open a can of whoop[1]ass  and lay some laws down. That's what I would have done. That would have been my game That would have been my game plan. plan. <br/>I lived in New Orleans, in St. Bernard Parish, right by the levee. The storm was a category 5. When it hit, it broke the levee. I was in my house. Me-- I have a German shepherd. His name was Rocky. And I tried to get out of the house, and I realized I wasn't going to make it. So I grabbed my ax, because as a fireman, one thing you learn is when you go  in something, you have to be able to get out. By the time I got upstairs, the water was rushing in, like...  Oh, my God. <br/>I look at Rocky. You know, I couldn't even see him. It was muddy water. He was gone. I can't even find him. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God, oh. <br/>So sad. <br/>I never lived in New Orleans and I'm not a fireman. I never even had a German shepherd. You know, I really ain't got that close to another dog yet. I had him for, like, nine years. <br/>Really? I'm such an animal lover. That was so hard for me to hear, and, I don't know, it just kind of gets to  you. <br/>And when I got on the roof, I stayed there for two days. <br/>Really? <br/>Two days. And it's crazy how you can break their hearts by telling them a lie. <br/>Russell is an interesting character because I really trusted him off the  start, but he's really been scrambling with everyone, and he was trying to  get people's sympathy about Katrina, which is probably very true, and his  dog, and I don't want to diminish that story, but I just think that it was--  he was angling at stuff, and I'm starting to feel like he's starting to feel  like he's pretty slimy. pretty slimy. <br/>I figure I'll make it a little interesting for everybody when they wake up. I emptied all the water out of all the canteens. I plan on weeding out the weak I plan on weeding out the weak right off the  bat. right off the bat. I plan on making it as miserable as possible for miserable as possible for  everybody. everybody. Little stuff like taking a sock, I done burn it in the fire. I think if I can control how they feel, I can control how they think. I'm really a multi-millionaire. I own an oil company in Houston. I'm not here for the money. I'm only here to show people how easy it is to win this game. Another accomplishment complete. I'm the worst one to trust out here. I should be the first one to go. But I'm going to do everything But I'm going to do everything it takes to win  this game. it takes to win this game. <br/>There's no more water. <br/>None whatsoever? <br/>No. <br/>Yeah, they're all empty. <br/>Oh, you know, I haven't been drinking. <br/>Somebody drank my whole canteen. <br/>Really? <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm looking for my socks, which I can't seem to find. Gone, disappeared. Me feet are starting to hurt. They're a little blistered, and I'd really like to find some I'd really like  to find some socks and to be warm, finally. socks and to be warm, finally. <br/>I don't mean to be, like, pressing, but we have to hurry. Because we have to fill the canteens, cook some crab up. <br/>Will you just relax? <br/>No, I don't want to relax. <br/>It's way too hot to touch. <br/>it's not that hot. We can start pouring it. With the coconut husk? <br/>Here. <br/>I'll do everything. <br/>No, Liz, Liz, you want to fill the canteen. <br/>It's hot. We can blow on it. <br/>You can blow on it and in a smaller portion it will cool it faster. Use a little common sense. <br/>My strategy is working like a dream. <br/>We have not had sleep. Just...  I slept fine. <br/>Congratulations. <br/>And they're hollering at each other right now. And I'm going to just sit back and watch them, you know, watch it happen. <br/>I just need to keep some serenity. <br/>I'll leave you alone. Right now, I think I am running the whole show. They don't even know it, but I They don't even know it, but I know I am. know I am. know I am. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. How you guys doing? <br/>Good. <br/>Good. <br/>Great. <br/>Probst: Russell, how you feeling about your tribe? <br/>Best group of people I could ever meet. Everybody's pulling their weight. Everybody tough as nails. <br/>Jeff, I've never read that book. "Things Losers Say."  That was really good. That was good. Can we start this, Jeff, because I'm ready to open some cans of whoop-ass. [laughing]  Probst: All right, for today's immunity challenge, six members of each tribe  will race across a series of A-frames while carrying three coils of rope. You will then use that rope to pull a heavy crate to the finish platform,  where the four remaining tribe members will disassemble the crate and use the  pieces to solve a puzzle. First tribe to finish wins immunity. <br/>Hmm...  Probst: This is the immunity idol. When you have this at your camp, you cannot go home. Tonight the losing tribe goes to Tribal Council. Tonight somebody will be the first person voted out of this game. All right, everybody, take your All right, everybody, take your spots, we'll  get started. spots, we'll get started. For immunity. Survivors ready? Survivors ready? Go! Go! Galu over in one fell swoop. Galu off to a huge lead. Galu off to a huge lead. Foa Foa quickly behind. Foa Foa quickly behind. <br/>Get a running start! <br/>Probst: Yasmin trying to get over for Galu. Russell now coming down to help. <br/>You got to climb, you got to climb. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa now working  Probst: Foa Foa now working together to get over. together to get over. Galu has all their members over the second A-frame. <br/>Go, go! [indistinct yelling]  Probst: Galu now working together, building a human pyramid. Great strategy! Foa Foa is over the second A[1]frame. <br/>Go. <br/>Go, Foa Foa! <br/>Russell, grab that rope! <br/>You can do it! <br/>Probst: This last A-frame-- much more difficult because there is no momentum. Galu is up and Galu is over. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Some skin coming off on that one. Foa Foa still working. Mick using his entire body to support Jaison. <br/>Come on, Galu! <br/>You can do it! <br/>Come on, Galu, let's go! <br/>Probst: Foa Foa is over. <br/>Come on, Foa Foa! You got this, guys. <br/>Probst: Both tribes now stretching out that rope. You've got to tie all three ropes to the heavy crate. Galu still in the lead. Go, go, go, go, go! <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>Heave-ho, heave-ho! <br/>Probst: Foa Foa is back in it. It's a tug-of-war now. [overlapping shouting]  You got it, you got it! <br/>Go, go, go, go, go! <br/>Probst: Russell grunting it out. Galu working well together. [overlapping shouting] Very heavy crates. <br/>Pull! <br/>Probst: Go! Puzzle makers, start working for Galu. Let's go! Go! Puzzle makers, start working for Foa Foa. Galu getting a quick, early start on putting this puzzle together. <br/>All right, you guys, what we need to do is we need to find writing on the top  only. <br/>"Survival," "survival."  Everybody grab a piece and find your match. <br/>Yes. <br/>S-U...  U-- here we go. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa making some progress. Galu absolutely nowhere on this puzzle. It's like they just started. This says "there..." [overlapping chatter]  Okay, come on, we get it now. We have it, we have it. <br/>Here, here, here, here... Here's a "V," here's a "V."  Probst: Galu thinks they have something going now. <br/>Got it, got it, got it! <br/>That's it. [overlapping chatter]  Come on, guys, we have it. <br/>Probst: Now it's Foa Foa who seems lost. <br/>That's not it. <br/>Drop it down, slide it down. <br/>Probst: Galu making a big move now on their puzzle. They think they have it. Are they right? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Shambo thinks they're close. Foa Foa falling further and further behind. <br/>"Without victory there is no survival!"  Probst: Galu wins immunity! <br/>Probst: Galu wins immunity! [cheering] [cheering]  Galu, Galu, Galu is in the house! Galu, Galu, Galu is in the house! [cheering]  Probst: Galu, congratulations. Immunity, safe tonight at Tribal Council. Monica, I will give you this-- fire. fire. [cheering] [cheering] Foa Foa, I got nothing for you except a date with me  tonight at Tribal Council where one of you will be the first person voted out  of this game. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. camp. See you at Tribal. See you at Tribal. <br/>Everybody, listen. That's only like the first quarter in a seven-game series. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>You know? It's a long way to go. <br/>Today at the challenge, we lost, and that sucks. I don't know whose fault it was. I feel like, you know, we all contributed. I need to go in. <br/>You got to make a decision now for real. <br/>We got to go in. I don't know, I think we have a lot to think about, but I don't want to be  the one to bring it up because then I'm gonna have a target on my back. <br/>I think right now it's a matter of strength. <br/>I do, too. <br/>I think, I think the weakest should go. You know? <br/>So what do you think? <br/>Well, weakest-wise, I think it's Ashley, just based purely on physical  strength. <br/>Yeah, I second Ashley. <br/>I'm 62. I'm the oldest one out here and, you know, I do not want to be the first one  out, you know, so I'm talking to a few people and saying that I think right  now we should work on strength. Ashley. I'm going based on strength, weakest. There's going to be hard challenges ahead of us, so I think we should vote  off the weakest, and I am not the weakest, and I am not the physically  weakest. physically weakest. <br/>Okay, but... but you've been, like, talking to everybody. <br/>I know. <br/>So I don't know why you've been doing that, and it makes me a little wary. <br/>Does it? <br/>It makes me wary, yeah, because I've seen you talking individually, like, to  everyone. <br/>So you think...  I'm just not sure...  If I'm talking individually, it doesn't mean I'm trying to be strategizing  with them. <br/>I'd rather keep it pretty low-key. I mean, what have you been talking about? <br/>Everything. We're out here on Survivor. Talking about having a good time, talking to some of them about what they  think and who they think the weakest... How do you come to me and threaten me  and telling me you're feeling uncomfortable. Are you kidding me? Marisa is the dumbest player I've ever seen. <br/>It is a game, you know. <br/>Yeah. I'm running the show here. You come up to me and threaten me, you got to go, and she's gone. She just completely threatened me, saying, "You're not making me  comfortable." I said, "Why is she telling me this right now?"  What is that going to make me think? That makes me think I got to get rid of her. <br/>Okay, who? <br/>Marisa. <br/>No, you think so? <br/>I know so. She's going first. <br/>Okay. <br/>If you stay with me, then you're going to be fine for a long time. Vote Marisa. <br/>Really? All right. <br/>My tribe will believe anything I tell them at any point because they're just  stupid. I'm starting to make her nervous. Why would you say that? <br/>Still don't know if Marisa... All right, good, because I can't stand that  bitch. <br/>Mick's the leader of the tribe, but I'm the one in charge of the camp. You can call me the puppet master. They can be my little puppets. They'll run when I tell them to run, they'll walk when I tell them to walk. When I'm finished with them, just throw them in the trash. <br/>I wouldn't trust Russ. <br/>Why do you say that? <br/>Oh, I just wouldn't. <br/>Well, tell me why. <br/>Well, tell me why. Give me a reason. Give me a reason. <br/>Oh, I don't know why. <br/>Oh, I don't know why. A woman's intuition. A woman's intuition. A woman's intuition. <br/>Probst: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch, approach the flame, dip it in, approach the flame,  dip it in, and get fire. and get fire. In this game, fire represents your life. As long as you have fire, you are still in the game. When your fire's gone, so are you. Unfortunately, for one of you, that will be the case tonight. How's that feel, Ashley, hearing that, that one of the ten of you going home  in just a few minutes? <br/>You know, it's really sad, but that's just the way the game works. You know, whatever. It is what it is. <br/>Probst: It is what it is. Russell, why not just vote her out now if it's not that big a deal. Let's get out of here. <br/>I don't know how to answer that question. <br/>Well, I think tonight we all realize that this is a dog eat dog game, and  we're all wearing Milk Bone underwear. So the honeymoon's over and we have to get serious, so...  Probst: Ashley, regretting that comment at all? <br/>No. It's a game. You have to vote people out. I think we all did our best today. And unfortunately, they beat us. <br/>I disagree. I thought they were lucky with the puzzle. <br/>Probst: Lucky? <br/>With the puzzle, yeah. <br/>Probst: Borassi, we'd still be there. You guys were nowhere close. Liz, you were designated "the smart person." Was that luck today? <br/>No, I don't think it was luck on their part. I think that we could have been a little bit more unified. Um, we're only as strong as our weakest link. <br/>Probst: Betsy, who do you think is the weak link? <br/>Um... I think Ashley's the weakest. <br/>Probst: Ashley. <br/>I find it very entertaining that she thinks I'm the weakest link, when I am  like, cardio-wise, physically fit. I work out tons at home. I mean, I was climbing those walls today. That should have shown that I'm fit and I don't understand how I'm the  weakest link at all. I don't-- I don't understand that. <br/>Probst: Marisa, who would you say it is? <br/>There's different levels of weakness, Jeff. So I-- I'm not... The weakest link is not... I mean, I'm just saying. <br/>That wasn't what he asked you. He said who do you think it is. Who do you think the weakest link is? <br/>I-- I don't...  Assert yourself and answer the question. It's not that hard. <br/>See, they don't like each other. <br/>Probst: That's quite clear. <br/>I like Ben. I like everybody, but Marisa. <br/>Probst: You voted for Marisa to be the leader. <br/>And she could be the leader. She has a very strong mind. She knows what she's talking about, she knows how to say it. <br/>Probst: Clearly Marisa must have told you what to do at some point. <br/>She just at one point told me that she's starting to worry about me, you know. I'm walking around with everybody in the tribe. Well, yeah. Doesn't mean I make an alliance with everybody in the tribe, or trying to  stab you in the back. But she just came right at me, so...  Well, he did say to me honesty is the most important thing in this game. So if I felt worried about him, I wanted to be honest with him and share that  with him. <br/>Well, as soon as she came at me telling me that she doesn't trust me--  I didn't say I didn't trust you...  then immediately I can't trust her-- immediately. <br/>I said I was worried about you. <br/>Well, that's not how I took it. <br/>She's concerned for your welfare, Russell. <br/>I know. <br/>Obviously in this game you're not safe no matter what. I would hate to go home right now, but if I did something to put a mark on my  back, well, then that was really dumb of me, and I need to fix it. And I can guarantee you it won't happen again. <br/>Probst: Okay, it is time to vote. vote. Betsy, you're up.

Good night. camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. Next time on Survivor: An epic battle fuels bad blood between the tribes. <br/>Listen, ignorant, why would a dude tackle me? <br/>Probst: Stop! Out of the challenge! And Russell goes on the warpath. <br/>She's full of crap. She's going to pay for that She's going to pay for that statement, I promise  you. statement, I promise you. <br/>Tonight's really difficult for me to swallow. I trusted Russell initially, but it was a mistake to say something to him. Because he makes trouble, and so he made it around me. And I'm really sad to be going home. I don't hold any animosity towards anyone and I'm grateful to have had the  experience to have had the experience however short it may have been.
