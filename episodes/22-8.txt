<br/>Episode 8 -  <br/>Jeff: previously on "Survivor": At Ometepe, Matt  and Andrea formed a tight bond right from the start. And Boston Rob saw them as a threat. <br/>I know how strong a pair can be in this game. <br/>Jeff: So he sent Matt to Redemption Island, but Matt  refused to go away, defeating everyone he faced, waiting for his shot to  re-enter the game. For the fifth time, Matt stays alive. Under Rob's leadership, the Ometepe tribe was flying high even  as old nemesis Phillip was beginning to feel like part of the team. <br/>Right now I'm on top of the earth. <br/>Jeff: And Rob had another ace up his sleeve. <br/>It's a clue wrapped up like a cookie but it doesn't Matter  what it says because I have the idol so I will just throw it away. <br/>Jeff: On the Zapatera tribe, Ralph also had a hidden  immunity idol. <br/>Awesome! <br/>Jeff: But his tribe was in trouble. At the last immunity challenge... Survivors ready? Go! Ometepe opening up a big lead right now. Everybody through the wall. Grant does it! Ometepe beat Zapatera for the third time in a row. At tribal council, it came down to Sarita, who was loyal, or David,  who was better at challenges. Sarita, the tribe has spoken. With Sarita off to Redemption Island, the Zapatera five are  hoping for a little redemption of their own. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We sure blindsided her. <br/>Tonight, we voted Sarita off because we felt like Sarita  was the weakest link when it came to helping us win the challenges. <br/>Yeah. I was going to talk to you about it. <br/>Don't worry about it. I understand. <br/>We are dwindling. We're down to five now and we have to win the next challenge--  we have to win the next two challenges. <br/>We have to even this thing out. No one likes a landslide. <br/>We've gotta win. <br/>Do battle. <br/>Exactly. <br/>Hello? Matt? <br/>Hey. <br/>It's Sarita. <br/>Hey, Sarita. [ laughs ] Sarita from the Zapatera tribe arrived at mi casa on Redemption  Island this evening. I was quite happy to see her because she doesn't appear to be  too incredibly tough. Yeah, I've just been hearing horror stories from Zapatera. Like, what's been going on? <br/>It's really not that bad. There are a lot of amazing people. Julie, Mike, Steve, Ralph-- good people. I love that I can share the good parts of Zapatera with him,  like, hey, here's who you want to stick with. Here who I'm not sure about. I love being able to give that to him because he is a really  good kid. You should be a little bit open to Mike. He's definitely my favorite player. <br/>I'm sort of thinking that Sarita might be the last of the  duelers before the merge. I trust the information that she's been giving me about the Zapatera  tribe. <br/>He's so ex-marine. He's a total bad ass. <br/>Up until this point, I was saying it would be better for  me to hop back on the train with Ometepe, but if all goes as planned and I  can win the duel, it would be quite the opportune moment to strike and take  out the Ometepe tribe. <br/>I have mail. <br/>Whooo! <br/>"Another duel to be played this morning and you know  it's anyone's game. This time your whole tribe will win this as another buff goes in  the flames."  I wonder if it's the last one. <br/>Merge. <br/>May be, man. <br/>Could be. <br/>Today we got tree mail that indicated that we are going to  see a duel at Redemption Island with both tribes fully present. So we suspect there's going to be a merge. <br/>We should pRobably bring our stuff just in case. <br/>I agree. <br/>If there's a merge, we're pRobably going to their beach. <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It would be foolish to leave our stuff here. <br/>My gut is they'd come here. <br/>You're a gambling man. <br/>I'm a gambling man. <br/>Okay. Then what do we want to risk? Going to the other beach and losing everything? Better to be safe than sorry. <br/>I kind of went through, you know, I'm sick and tired of  being the redheaded stepchild! But, you know what, frankly? I've learned a lot playing the game with Rob. So this is a whole new game now. We've got the numbers. And if it is a merge, I'm very comfortable staying with the Ometepe  tribe. <br/>Wow, we're all going. <br/>You know what that might mean? A duel followed by a merge. <br/>Wouldn't that be crazy? <br/>My personal hope is we get to a merge, I'm ready to sink  my teeth in to some of the other members of the Ometepe tribe. Rob is the obvious target. He's a master at this game. I'm ready to get in the ring and go toe to toe with that guy. <br/>Today is duel number 6 for me. I'm really nervous because I cut my foot pretty badly. It's right on the outside of my foot so if it's one of those  endurance challenges it's going to be really, really difficult. But god gave me this platform and I'm going to do the best I can  and hopefully come out with another victory. <br/>Matt is going to be hard to beat but I am going in with so  much confidence. I think I'm a worthy opponent. <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the competitors for today's duel. Matt will be battling against Sarita. Voted out at the last tribal council. Welcome to Redemption Island arena. We've invited everybody from both tribes to witness your duel  today. Because the winner of today's duel will go back in the game. <br/>If Matt wins, it's no good for me personally because you  know, I'm one who sent him to Redemption Island. So I'm figuring he's holding that against me. And there's a possibility he might defect to the other team. I mean, that's what I would do. <br/>Jeff: For today's duel, you will use your arms to brace  yourself against two walls while your bare feet are perched on very narrow  footholds. Every 15 minutes, you'll move to a smaller foothold. Last person left standing wins this duel, re-enters the game,  and continues their quest for the million-dollar prize. Loser is out for good. This is it. One shot. It's a biggie. Take your spots. All right, this duel is on. You'll stay on this foothold for 15 minutes. If you're still going, then we'll move to the next smaller  foothold. <br/>Zen, Sarita. <br/>Piece of cake. <br/>Jeff: All right, you've been up there 15 minutes. It is time to move down to the next foothold. You've got 15 seconds... Get situated.... Five, four, three, two, one. The challenge continues. <br/>All right, Matt. <br/>Jeff: You'll be on this foothold for 15 minutes. Now you're pRobably down to about a quarter inch of wood that  your feet are resting on. It's going to be a little more painful. Phillip, give us some insight. The situation like this, what do do you to be successful? <br/>Well, the buschuto code was how a samurai knew he had to  conduct his life when he was facing difficult circumstances, and they had a  whole strategy about the task at hand, and they shamed their feudal lord,  they would have to cut themselves. That was one of the things they looked for, and they looked for  you to make the first move, and then they would strike. And the buschuto code gave them a way to live as the bible. For Matt, it's given him a way to live. I know he knows it's all up here. And as long as he keeps that focus, he'll be just fine. <br/>Thanks, Phillip. <br/>Jeff: It is time now to move to the third and final  foothold. You'll have 15 seconds, get settled. Make sure you're really locked in because you're going to be  stuck here till the end of the challenge. Five, four, three, two, one. Good work, Sarita. <br/>Good job, Sarita. Zen, baby. <br/>Jeff:you are now on the final foothold. There is no time limit now. We go until one of you drops. This is it. You're on pRobably an eight of an inch of wood right now. There's very little there. <br/>Good job, Sarita. Stay there. <br/>You own this, Sarita. You own this. <br/>Jeff: women have done very well in this challenge,  historically. <br/>Looking good, Matt. <br/>Jeff: Matt readjusting a little bit. Cramps pRobably starting to set in. Working their way all the way up your legs. <br/>You got this, Sarita. <br/>Good job, Sarita. <br/>Keep on going. <br/>Good job, girl. <br/>Jeff: Sarita finding that zone. <br/>You're looking great, Matt. Hang in there, man. You're looking real good. <br/>Oh, god. <br/>Jeff: Sarita digging deep. Keep digging. You want a shot back in this game, you got it. Sarita drops out of the duel. Matt seizes the moment and will re-enter this game. <br/>Good job, Sarita. <br/>Great, great try, Sarita. [ applause ]  Jeff: how you feeling? <br/>I'm bummed. I thought I had it. <br/>Jeff: All right, Sarita, you are out of this game. Your shot at the million dollars is over. Grab your stuff. Toss your buff on your way out. <br/>See you back home, Sarita. <br/>Have fun, you guys. [ applause ]  Jeff: Matt, congratulations. Six duels, six wins. You are back in this game. You can take your buff off, too. I've got a new one for you. It's clean. <br/>All right! <br/>Jeff: And it's a different color. Because we are merged. <br/>Whoa! [ cheers ]  Yes! <br/>Jeff: Drop your old one, put on your new one, and rejoin  the one tribe. All right, are you going to merge to a new beach. Here's a map. One more thing-- beginning with the next tribal council, Redemption  Island starts again. <br/>What! <br/>Jeff: That means, Matt, you could be voted out again and  sent right back here. <br/>Guys, just please, give me a minute. <br/>Jeff: Grab your stuff, head out, leave your old buffs  behind. <br/>This is-- this is crazy. I'm absolutely stoked to be back in the game right now. I mean, I definitely think my time on Redemption Island gives me  an advantage because I had six people break down everything that was going on  in each tribe. Now I've got a couple of options. I can either go with Ometepe. I can go with Zapatera. But I've got to be careful because one slip-up out here and  you're gone. <br/>Yes, yes, yes! <br/>Walking up and seeing all that food was like a dream come  true. My whole body got happy. I felt like just a little kid at a carnival. [ screaming ]  Oh, my god. <br/>Oh, thank you! <br/>This is heaven. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>We sat down. We had a great picnic, finally got some good food. We had prusciutto, bread, wine, local beer, big deal of mixed  nuts, dates. We've got chicken to cook tonight. Life's pretty good right now. <br/>You guys what, do you think of a name? <br/>Who's got some spanish names. <br/>Murlonio means "From the sea united."  Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful. <br/>Does everyone like that? <br/>Say it one more time? <br/>Murlonio. Murlonio doesn't mean anything. It's an inside joke between amber and I. She has a bunch of stuffed animals and murlonio is the  ringleader so that's the name of our new tribe. <br/>One, two, three, murlonio! <br/>First thing on my mind when I found out we had to build a  new shelter was oh, my gosh. We've got to do this again. But I think it's important actually that we did build the  shelter all together because that's the icebreaker. <br/>Let's throw the deck in. <br/>Matt is the key linchpin to this whole deal. He was voted out by the Ometepe tribe, and I think at this  point, he doesn't have a huge amount of loyalty towards them. But it looks like Matt and Andrea are very tight, so this is  where I gotta go for broke. I gotta try and make as big of a move as I can because I don't  want to just just sit back and get dealt with when it's my time at the hands  of Boston Rob. <br/>The way it stands right now, if Rob gets what he wants,  he's just going to take us out one by one, and then I think it's pRobably  going to be you, Andrea, and Phillip next. And you Andrea are the biggest chess pieces in this game right  now and I trust you guys wholeheartedly. And, you know, if you guys can team up with us, I can assure you  that we can go to the final four. <br/>I believe you. <br/>Okay? <br/>And I'm okay whittling down my tribe to honor my  commitment to you and Andrea because you're integral parts to this thing. <br/>I want to be in this game as long as I can so I'm really  just trying to figure out what's best for me and which route to take because  last time I was coasting and waiting to play the game and this time I can't  be near as passive because I'll be back on Redemption Island in a jiffy. <br/>Here's the deal. If you need the idol, you've got it. <br/>I like the sound of it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>But I just gotta talk things over with Andrea. <br/>It is truly in her best interest as well. <br/>Yeah, it is. <br/>...And it's leaking like a sieve on the back half where Zapatera  is. <br/>There's a division between us, and it's pretty tough being  on the down side of a 7-5 tribe. Andrea and Matt, I hope they're ready to switch sides. Otherwise, we're dead. <br/>When you were blindsided, I had no idea. <br/>Let me tell you this right now. Right now, you are my closest ally. <br/>Good. <br/>I didn't know that. I didn't know what you were thinking. <br/>Okay, this is what I want. I want to take out the Ometepe tribe. Because I'm honestly at the bottom of the alliance. I was thinking, like, we vote Steve out, and then we vote Phillip  out. Ometepe thinks everything is hunky dory and that's when we  blindside Rob. <br/>Oh, my god! I'm so nervous. <br/>Just stop. Just calm down and just hear me out. This game respects big moves. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It does. And this is a huge move. <br/>Right now I am tight with Rob-- I have to make it seem  like  That's what I'm saying. We can only talk to each other about this. <br/>We cannot say anything to them. I will consider that we had this a long time from now. I have no pRoblem with cutting those two because they kind of backstabbed  us in the beginning. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I really like Matt, but he had this idea that he wanted to  blindside the Ometepe tribe, and in the back of my mind I'm thinking, this  could be bad. It's extremely risky for me to jump ship at this point. But I'm definitely keeping my options open. <br/>Hey, what's going on? What are you reading over there? <br/>Matthew, the story of jesus' escape to egypt. <br/>Forgot all about that. <br/>Yeah. About the same time as "Survivor"? <br/>Yeah and this may sound crazy to you all, but after I beat  Stephanie, it was like god wanted me to win Redemption Island. I really feel I was put here for a reason, and that that reason  was, I believe, to honor my god. So I'm morally conflicted here because I really genuinely care  about everyone on the former Ometepe tribe. Part of me wants to do the big "Survivor" move. However, right now, I feel like my heart's almost telling me not  to and just to stick with Ometepe. <br/>"Man does not live on bread alone but on every word  that comes from the mouth of god." that's just such beautiful language,  you know? What would I really say? There's like a christian coalition brewing here in nicaragua. Look, I got nothing against god. I mean, I go to church on sunday, but any time a group of  individuals likes the same thing, I don't like that. It could be romantic comedies. It could be oreo cookies. If they're all liking it together, I want that broken up. Who knows, Mike, maybe he already thinks he's going to grab one  or two of them. Can't let that happen. If Mike doesn't win individual immunity I feel like he should be  the first sent over there to Redemption Island. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to your first individual immunity  challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: First things first. Andrea, I will take back tribal immunity. Tribal immunity is done. This is now what you covet. <br/>All right! <br/>Oh! <br/>Nice! <br/>Jeff: Individual immunity. If you are wearing the necklace, you are safe in this game. You cannot be voted out. Without it, you are most definitely vulnerable. Shall we get to the challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, you will be perched on a  small log while balancing a ball on a wooden disk. At regular intervals, we will add more balls, making it more difficult. If at any point a ball falls off, you're out of the challenge. <br/>Whoa! <br/>Jeff: last person left standing wins immunity and is safe  at tribal council. Losers, somebody will be voted out and sent to Redemption Island. Make sense? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yup. <br/>Jeff: All right, take your spots. We'll get started. All right, everybody take a spot up on your log. Get comfortable. All right, let's take ball number one. Place it on your disk. I'll give you five seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. And release your hands. This challenge is on. Phillip already having trouble balancing on the log. Everybody else looking pretty steady. Phillip wobbling. Can he save it? Nice recovery by Phillip. I'm impressed. <br/>I got rhythm, baby. <br/>Jeff: 15 seconds left in this round. Hang on for 15 seconds and you move on. Julie's out of the challenge. Take a spot on the bench. We are down to 11. All right, we're going to add another ball. That means you can put your hand on the ball on your disk. You are safe. Grab a second ball. Get steady. Five, four, three, two, one. This is going to get much more difficult now. Ashley out of the challenge. Take a step back on the bench. We are down to 10. David now struggling. Gotta get it back. David drops the ball. David is out of the challenge. 30 seconds left in this round. You guys are doing great. Ralph wavering a little bit. Dig, Ralph! You've done more difficult than this. <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Jeff: This round is over. Everybody grab your balls. You are safe. We're going to add the third and final ball now. There will be no stopping. Last person left standing wins immunity. Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one. Release. Now it will be very difficult. Three balls standing on a round log with the wind. No more time limits now. We go until only one person is left. Andrea with a great recovery but can't hang on. Andrea's out of the challenge. Take a spot on the bench. Grant, don't lose it now. Grant is out of the challenge. We're down to seven. Mike has not wavered this entire challenge. Rob now struggling. Phillip with a great recovery. Like he's riding a wave! Matt has one ball hanging just on the edge of his disk. Matt is out of the challenge. Rob drops out of the challenge. Phillip wobbling. Can he save it? Phillip is out of the challenge. Everybody get your composure. We are now down to four. Mike, Steve, Natalie and Ralph. One former Ometepe. Three former Zapateras. I'm impressed. You're going a long time. <br/>Come back here [ whistling ]  Jeff: Ralph... One ball hanging on the edge. Ralph drops out of the challenge. We are now down to three. Natalie and Steve need to hope for something to happen to Mike  because right now, he's like a statue. Steve with those balls hanging on the edge of the disk. Focus. Don't drift. Steve is out of the challenge. We are down to the final two. Mike and Natalie. Mike, no movement at all. None. It's like those balls are glued to his disk. Natalie having to do some balancing, some recovering. <br/>Jeff: The first sign of movement from Mike. Mike falls out of the challenge, Natalie wins first individual  immunity! <br/>Are you kidding me? <br/>Jeff: Natalie, come on over. [ applause ] look at that. Getting a round of applause. <br/>Yay! <br/>Jeff: Natalie, safe at tonight's tribal council. As for the rest of you, should be an interesting afternoon. 11 people, two newly merged tribes. Can't wait to get to tribal, where somebody will be voted out of  this game, and that person will be sent to Redemption Island. See you at tribal. Nice job. <br/>Thank you. [ applause ]  We're going to tribal council tonight. And I've been talking to Matt about flipping. But if he decides to join forces with Ometepe tribe, it could be  me going to Redemption Island. <br/>Good job today, mama. <br/>I'm so proud of you, baby. All right! <br/>Thank you. <br/>Good job. <br/>Natalie was a champ. <br/>What happened is my feet went numb and then they just went  whoop. The challenge today was quite a battle. I think I hung in there for about 40 minutes. I was in the zone. I was feeling it. I was like I am coming back with the immunity necklace around my  neck but it didn't come out right, so this first vote between the tribes is a  big one, and I might be on the chopping block. I don't think they're going to go after Steve or Julie. I don't think they see you guys as threats. I think it's going to be Ralph or me because I did well at the  immunity challenge today. <br/>The immunity challenge today. <br/>Are you okay playing the idol for me to try to wipe out  their votes? <br/>If we need to. <br/>Okay. <br/>Rob is going to know he's the serpent's head and we're  coming after him so I think we should take out Rob's right-hand man and go Grant. They won't see that coming. That's very smart. <br/>I like it. <br/>Pretty awesome, huh? <br/>I've grown so much through that Redemption Island  experience. That was a time when I relied on god, and I was tough. This absolutely is a game, but my heart is telling me don't  change. And I want to honor my god and be true to who I am. So I've decided I don't want to switch. I don't want to flip. And I'm just going to have to have peace with whatever happens. I mean, if it's god's will, he'll take me as far as he wants me  to go. Rob, Mike was telling me, look, I have an idol for and you Andrea. Him, Ralph, and Steve. And he's like, "And I could use you to save you with it,  and then it would be you in the final four." I'm like, that would be  cool. I want to go as far as I can. But I'm with you all. I want to continue relationships with our tribe. <br/>Thanks, man. That means a lot; it really does. Matt just told me he was thinking about flipping and going with Zapatera. First of all, he has the audacity to think that he's going to  come up with a plan to vote me out. And then the stupidity to tell me that. It just confirmed he can't be trusted. So because of that, I'm giving him a one-way ticket back to Redemption  Island. <br/>It would be such a great plan. I had it all figured out. But morally I was, like, going back and forth. I'm glad we talked because now I don't have to worry about  anything. Andrea, I came clean, told him about Mike and everything. I know they wanted to bring you in, but I'm not flipping. We're not doing any of that. <br/>Yesterday, Matt and I were like okay, we're not telling  anybody what we're planning. And now he's, like, throwing me under the bus to Rob. It's so stupid because that could have sabotaged my plan to get  to, like, the final three completely. <br/>So should we vote for someone like Mike? <br/>I don't know. It's just like you're swinging for the fences in the first  inning. <br/>Maybe the smart thing is to go for someone like Steve or Julie. <br/>I think Steve. I don't think they'd give up the idol for him. <br/>Steve doesn't do ... Around here, anyway. He told me that him and Andrea were going to join up with them. <br/>Are you serious! <br/>Yup. He's trying to get us again. It's got to be Matty, bro. <br/>Dude I'm-- he's such a good christian guy. <br/>Well, he can still be a good christian guy. On Redemption Island. <br/>Yeah. <br/>He's playing both sides still. He is. <br/>I love him, but he's just too nice. He's doing the same thing he did the first time around. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Like, I'm kind of feeling ostracized here. <br/>Yeah. Looking at Matt, I can see paranoia getting to him, which is a  beautiful thing to have at this point. So I think he knows that he could potentially be on the chopping  block with the Ometepe tribe. You and Andrea need to jump with us because you'll go much  further than you will with them. I guarantee you, Rob has gotten guys in a pecking order. <br/>I know, I'm sixth. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>So, what am I doing tonight? <br/>Everybody. <br/>Okay. <br/>Matty, come over here, please. <br/>Matt said he doesn't necessarily know what's going on, and  Boston Rob snagged him up. I'm going to write a note to Matt. <br/>Matt, could you twist this one right here? <br/>Huh? <br/>Could you twist this right here. Could you twist that? <br/>Right here? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Top three, huh? That's not bad. We're all getting ready to go to tribal council and Mike slips  me this note. This is my golden ticket to the final three. So here I am, at the crossroads between keeping my word and  breaking my word. <br/>What are you thinking? What are the possibilities that you would do something crazy  tonight? <br/>I mean, I don't want to at all, like... But...  He went on a walk. <br/>Tonight's vote is monumental. If things go down the way they're supposed to go down, then Matty  is going home. If Matt and Andrea are with them, then I'm going to be in a  world of hurt. Here's what's going down. <br/>Rob wants me to vote for Matt, but I trusted Rob once  before, and I got royally screwed over. So it might be the wisest move to flip with Matt because I could  be next to go. <br/>It's in Matt's hands at this point. <br/>On the other hand, Matt's just sketchy and he's flighty,  so I don't know what to do. <br/>Jeff: A lot of people at tribal. Ralph, what's 12 people like, in one camp living together? <br/>Boy, it's rough. It's like two teams still yet. We're sleeping in two little areas, and ain't doing a lot of  talking. They go their way and we our'n. <br/>It's crazy what's going on over there, Jeff. Nobody's saying anything to each other. I never seen anything like it. <br/>Jeff: David, is this what you expected? <br/>It is odd. We got the really bad side of the shelter last night. They were under the tarp. We were under the palm fronds, and we were soak wet within five minutes  of rain last night. <br/>We won the tarp, first of all, so if we choose to sleep  under the tarp--  I would like to add the asterisk-- to win, that I didn't  really try too hard. <br/>Jeff: So Zapatera did throw a challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff, that's the distinction between the two tribes. Because--  Oh, please! Please. <br/>Please don't interrupt. I'll be courteous and let you speak. Don't interrupt. We would never not try. And here's what I'd like to say about that, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: please. <br/>There are some on that tribe, like deceit. Which can be beautiful and glorious, but you know when received  outward, it sometimes leaves a stench so great. You know that it's pRobably carrying something parasitic, and,  therefore, you don't want to aproach it. <br/>Jeff: Now, what are you guys laughing at? <br/>That. <br/>Whatever Phillip just said. It was funny. <br/>It is two different tribes, but I don't dislike them as  people. I think we're both being loyal to the tribes we originated with,  and that's what it comes down to. <br/>Jeff: And, Matt, here are you, fresh back from Redemption  Island, coming into this. <br/>Man, it was so much easier on Redemption Island. Just not having all these people around. I've had some pretty wild tribal councils so far. I'm starting to kind of have a funny feeling about this place. <br/>Jeff: So, Mike, there are six Ometepe, five Zapatera, and Matt. Obviously, he's a big vote. <br/>Absolutely. Matt is the man in the middle. You can see it wearing on him, but everything's going to fall  out here at this tribal council and we're going to find out where everybody  stands. <br/>Jeff: Ralph, what do you do to try to convince Matt to  come with you guys? <br/>Be good to him. Take him further in the game. They done canned him once, so they'll pRobably do it again. <br/>Jeff: Matt, fair argument. These are the guys that voted you out. Why go back to them? <br/>It's an extremely fair argument to say that because I've  been gone the past 15 days. It's not like time stopped. They continued to grow in their relationships and get closer  together. It looks like I'm on the bottom of the alliance here, and  honestly, I still even struggled today with what to do but I'm starting to  see the whole picture. <br/>Jeff: well, it sounds like a big vote and, Matt, you are  smack dab in the middle of it. Natalie has the immunity necklace, cannot vote for Natalie. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. Natalie, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol you want to play it now  would be the time to do so. <br/>I want to play this on Mike. <br/>Jeff: Okay, giving this to Mike. This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast against Mike will not count. Once the vote are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Grant. Grant. Two votes Grant. That's three votes Grant. Four votes for Grant. Five votes for Grant. Steve. Five votes for Grant, one vote for Steve. Matt. Matt. Two votes Matt. Three votes Matt. Matt. Four votes Matt. We're tied. Five votes Grant, five votes Matt, one vote Steve. Eighth person voted out of "Survivor Redemption Island"--  Matt. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Jeff: Matt, once again, the tribe has spoken. You know the drill. You're going to head back to Redemption Island where once again  you will have a chance to get back in this game. <br/>What the hell, guys. <br/>Jeff: well, that is a "Survivor" first. Here's the pRoblem-- Matt is now heading to Redemption Island  where at least one of the 11 of you will have to face him in a duel, and I  have a feeling forgiveness, not going to be on his mind. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor":  Grant! <br/>Jeff: And Rob are through. Hello! Rob cements control of his tribe. <br/>One, two, three, Ometepe! <br/>Jeff: Or does he? <br/>I'm my own man. I make my own decisions. And Phillip gets a makeover. Phillip, did you have a collision with a hawk? <br/>I asked for a sign, and out of thin air, appeared this  feather. <br/>What actually happened? I have no idea. I put my trust in god and today god's will was contradictory to  what I wanted. I like these people. I want to be friends with these people. But they don't want to be friends with me. And, apparently, I'm just not very good at this game of  "Survivor." [ sighs ]
