<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor:Hiki finally sparked a flame. <br/>Guys, it's lit! [ laughter]  We got fire! <br/>Probst: On Raro...  Hey Adam, this is quite a bit of work. <br/>Probst: ...priorities were questioned. <br/>Do you two want to a raised platform? <br/>I thought it sounded nice. <br/>I know you do, but we have to decide things as a group. <br/>Probst: At Aitu, Billy wasn't pulling his weight...  If we lose Billy, we come back stronger than ever. <br/>Probst: ...so Ozzy suggested a bold plan to throw the challenge and oust  Billy. <br/>Billy's just dead weight. So we might as well cut our losses now and get on with the game. <br/>Probst: J.P. was on board, but Cristina the cop was skeptical. <br/>I'm thinking, you know, this doesn't seem right. I don't know if I can trust Oscar any more. <br/>Probst: But at the challenge... Puka's on the course, Raro's on the course,  Hiki's on the course. ...Ozzy's plan went into action. Aitu completely unconcerned about this challenge. Puka, Raro, Hiki, all safe from tribal council. Aitu came in dead last and chose Yul from the Puka tribe to go to Exile  Island. <br/>Yul, boat's waiting for you now. <br/>Probst: Before the tribes parted, Billy thought he and parted, Billy thought  he and Candice made a connection. Candice made a connection. On Exile Island, Yul deciphered the clues and found the hidden immunity idol. <br/>Oh, mama. I found the immunity idol. If there's an opportunity where it can change the game, I'd use it. <br/>Probst: At Aitu's tribal council, Billy revealed a secret. <br/>I fell in love in this game, love at first sight. Her name is Candice. And in between... [ laughter]  Probst: Candice from Raro tribe? <br/>Yeah, after the last challenge, we sort of mouthed the words "I love  you" to one another, and so that was my prize. My prize was her. <br/>Probst: In the end, Billy's tribemates cut him loose. tribemates cut him loose. Billy, the tribe has spoken. Billy, the tribe has spoken. 18 are left. 18 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? [ tribal-style singing] [ tribal-style singing] Captioning sponsored by CBS  PARAMOUNT NETWORK CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION TELEVISION  I'm sorry, I can't get over the love at first sight, I just can't. <br/>The what? <br/>The love at first sight. <br/>You know, anything's possible. Maybe he really had a crush on her. Maybe she was playing him though. I don't think she would have said...  I think she was going...  You know what? They never had any kind of, like, contact or communication. <br/>Study him, the way he is around the camp, all that kind of stuff, I don't  know. All the stuff that came out of Billy's mouth tonight was just ridiculous. I don't even know... words can't describe what... about the Candice situation. And if it's true, it's true. And if it's true, it's true. But it's not true. But it's not true. <br/>I was on the way. Like we stop at this Vietnamese restaurant because my wife and I was hired by  this restaurant guy. And this old man, he said, "I come to United States, I'm so lonely. All my friends are in Vietnam." He's, like, 50-something. And he's just missing the old days. "But I come to United States for my children's future." I go,  "How old are your children?" "Oh, 15 and 16." [ laughs]  15 and 16. They tricked you, they tricked you. He goes, "What?" 15 and 16. You think in a couple more years they'll be in Iraq? I'm sorry, for what? [ laughs] You are Vietnamese. You should know better about war. You should know all about war. <br/>I have had sort of a coming to Jesus in my own mind with Cao Boi. The guy just does not shut up. <br/>What if they wanted to go to college? <br/>So what if you go to college? If there is a draft, your ass is going. College. Unless you're a senator's children or congressman's children, you're going. Unless are you Mr. Bush's children or your lineage is blue or something. <br/>I don't think he's all there. I really in my heart of hearts don't think he's all there, and will ever be  there. will ever be there. Unless he's medicated. Unless he's medicated. <br/>"Your biggest challenge yet will require brawn. But if you're thinking wisely it could be the winning tribe you're on. Use your powers of observation and your intuition, too. You may get a better life at camp or just head home feeling blue."  Just getting up, we got a challenge early. Morning challenge of some kind. And the tribe is strong. You know, we haven't lost yet. We're one of the two tribes that hasn't lost anything. I went to Exile Island. We came back and won the next challenge. That didn't really weaken us. So we're okay. And we're ready to rock 'n' roll. roll. We're doing great. We're doing great. We're doing great. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. Getting your first look at the new Aitu tribe.

All of the items accumulated will be pooled together and divided evenly  between the two tribes. Two new tribes, a whole new game. game. Head on out. Head on out. <br/>A welcoming home...  Feast? That sounds great. <br/>We just moved up, girl. [ laughter]  This a blessing from life. Today is the best day ever. [ laughs] It's like they took us out of the ghetto and took us to Bel Air. We have been so weak and depleted, and today we got to throw off those  stanky, yellow buffs, and now we're a new buffs, and now we're a new tribe. tribe. <br/>How did you all feel when you first realized how your tribe was going to be  set up? What was y'all's thoughts, feelings about that? How you were segregated? <br/>I thought it was weird. <br/>You know what? I thought it was okay just for the fact that whether it's good or bad, it  brings a attention to it and makes people think. I just think that's a good thing. <br/>The way our tribe is blended at this point, it's all about people and who we  are and what we bring to the table. You really don't see color. You see the heart of that individual and what they're doing to make your  tribe stronger. And that's what this is all about. <br/>Adam's a snorer. <br/>I don't snore. [ everyone talking at once]  We're back to America. We're a melting pot. I love it. Everyone's all mixed back together, and I just think it's together, and I  just think it's great. great. <br/>First and foremost, it's going to be all smiles and "Pleasure to meet  you" and "Glad you're here." But in the back of your mind,  it's a game, and you're in it to win it for yourself. And first and foremost: cold, hard cash. <br/>One, two, three! [ cheers and applause] [ cheers and applause]  I'm so excited. <br/>I'm so excited. <br/>Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome. [ cheers and applause] You're home! You're home! Welcome. <br/>First off, you guys did an amazing job. This is fantastic. <br/>This is beautiful. <br/>Is it watertight? <br/>We have a wall. Where's our wall? Go back. <br/>There's a wall in there. <br/>We felt that Cecilia and Ozzy were very welcoming. They were just so excited. Cecilia was the hostess. She stood there and gave us the spiel, point this out, point that out, do  that, do this, this is what we got. Mi casa es su casa. They're Hispanic-- mi casa es su casa. su casa. That's beautiful. That's beautiful. We got our own little torch to light up the whole place. [ laughter]  I'm definitely so happy about the transition in this game. I definitely feel a change of energy here. I feel the vibration from other people on my new tribe that I didn't have the  same in my old tribe. <br/>You're not Asian. I love it. I think you're fine, okay. I think you're awesome. <br/>I'm really excited about just having fun people to hang out with. <br/>Okay, so I have to ask you something. Please don't be offended. Billy, when he left-- and I'm just curious-- Billy, when he left, he said  that you guys are, like, love at first sight. <br/>Love at first sight? <br/>Yes. And my jaw just dropped and I was like...  You and Billy? <br/>That is the weirdest thing I ever heard. So I got to ask you...  I mean, what did he mean by that? <br/>He said before the... we left the last challenge, we mouthed the words  "I love you" to each other. <br/>No, he's...  Oh, no. <br/>Were you saying good luck, or...  No. He said at the challenge or whatever at the very end, he just looked over to  me and Parvati, and he was like, "I'm dead." And I was like,  "I'm sorry, that really sucks" or whatever. I was like, "We love you." Like, our team, you know? I didn't mean it like that. <br/>He took it as you guys had a love connection at first sight. He said that that was his million dollars, to get to be with you. Or like you know, know you, like, be on the same team with you. <br/>You lead him on, Candice. <br/>No, I did not. [ laughter]  You flirt, you. <br/>You led him on. <br/>You led him on. <br/>Oh, please. <br/>Oh, please. <br/>We've got to make a little  We've got to make a little fire today. fire today. Oh that's good. Oh that's good. Oh, that one's really good. Oh, that one's really good. <br/>What are they doing? <br/>I don't know, bonding. [ laughter]  We men. <br/>There are so many men on this tribe now. It seems like we got all the really big buff guys. I'm absolutely going to flirt with them. Get them on my good side. It's what I do best. Aw, baby monkey. <br/>Yeah, am I your baby monkey? <br/>I already had Adam from the beginning. <br/>You have water in there? <br/>I was drawn to Nate in the first place just because he's so, like, outgoing  and funny and kind of charming. So I decided to work him, just for starters. Your pants are falling off, Your pants are falling off, Nate. Nate. <br/>Lure him into my web, chomp and suck his blood. and suck his blood. [ laughs] [ laughs]  May have cooked these too long, Cao Boi. Cao Boi, how are you doing? <br/>What? <br/>I said how are you doing. <br/>I'm doing fine, sir. <br/>I'm doing fine, sir. <br/>That's beautiful. <br/>That's beautiful. <br/>That's beautiful. <br/>Cool. <br/>Cool. <br/>I trust Yul, I trust Candice. <br/>I totally agree. No question that the four of us should be...  Then we were thinking of adding Flicka to make it five. <br/>Believe me, I can get her to do whatever we need her to do. <br/>Do you think...  I'll just say to her, "You, me and Candice, we're going to stay together  and we're going to deal with these other two people, okay?"  I hear you. <br/>I knew Becky was the person I had to get to first. But she was the key. She came right to me. She said, "Yul and I would like to get together with you and  Candice." I said, "Great." I said, "I believe that I have  Flicka," hoping that she would Flicka," hoping that she would say  "Okay, great." say "Okay, great."  I think we can align with a couple of the Asians. I think that's going to be able to happen. So we'll have a good, strong five, I'm hoping. All right? But if anybody else approaches you, just say, "Oh, yeah, whatever,"  or "I'm not thinking about it." Just...  I'm not thinking about it. I'm just sitting here. <br/>I am thinking about it. So you don't have to think about it. Let me think about it. But I'm thinking about it. Stay with me and Candice and we'll take these other two and the five of us  will go to the merge. <br/>Jonathan wants me to stay in the alliance from our original tribe, in which I  don't really necessarily feel that comfortable because I didn't feel that  comfortable in that tribe to begin with. <br/>We're strong. We'll go all the way. I mean, seriously, we'll make it to the top five. It's going to be cool, all right? <br/>All right. I'm just kind of playing my cards like I'm not really thinking about  alliances. I'm just here to make friends and see what happens and try to, you know, go  as long as I to, you know, go as long as I can without feeling fake. can without feeling fake. <br/>Candice and I, we were talking and so she... her and Jonathan basically were  pretty strong, too, and so, it's just, you know, the perfect four. But then we were trying to figure out our fifth person. So Jonathan mentioned Flicka, and then we were deciding between Ozzy and  Cecilia. So I don't know if her and Ozzy already have an alliance or not because they  are two and they...  I'm sure that right now they're kind of expanding a little bit because they  realize that they're coming into this with fewer numbers. And so, I mean, if we went along tribal lines, I mean, those people would be  voted out along with Sundra. I've to tell you something. And again, you know, I'm telling this because I totally trust you. <br/>Right, right. <br/>This is sort of like my gesture that, like, I trust you and, like, all the  stuff we talked about, I really believe in. I found the idol. <br/>That's so awesome. <br/>Yeah. <br/>First day or second day? <br/>I found it... well, I found it overnight just thinking about the clues and  kind of working it out. But you know, if we can somehow turn the game around and get us ahead, you  know, you are in a situation where I could save your butt, I mean, I'll do it. <br/>I appreciate it. I trust you. You know that I trust you. <br/>Becky and I have, I think, a tight bond and strong alliance coming out of our  Puka tribe. You know, I think it's a huge advantage in this game to have somebody that  you can absolutely trust. And I think, given our backgrounds and our common interests, I felt  comfortable disclosing the information to her. <br/>I am not going to tell anybody. I don't think you should tell anybody again. Oh, I'm so excited! I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of you. That's so awesome. That's so awesome. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>He has a what? <br/>He has a what? <br/>Octopus. <br/>Octopus. <br/>I felt like the man! I was, "What, octopus, what do you got now?" It's a good feeling. No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. <br/>Pull it back. Strong. <br/>Look at him sucking me. <br/>I told you. [ laughter]  He is going home! <br/>Pull that head back. <br/>Ha, ha. <br/>Yeah, Nate. <br/>How did you find him? <br/>I don't think the guys or anyone really expected me to do it, to come back  with something, and something so heavy. Looking at it, you know, just hanging, I was like, "Yeah, we're eating  this fool tonight."  We got dinner, ladies. <br/>It's huge. <br/>How did you get that? <br/>I had a spear, and I couldn't let go of the spear because he would swim off  with it. He was strong. <br/>That is a lot of meat. You need it. You could probably eat that whole thing yourself. whole thing yourself. <br/>Probably. <br/>Probably. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right, for today's challenge, each tribe will begin clipped  together by a rope. In addition, each of you will be carrying a 15-pound sandbag on your back. You will start on opposite sides of the course. On my go, you will race through knee-deep water attempting to catch the other  tribe. When you get tired, and some of you will, it's okay to opt out of the  challenge. But first, you have to take your 15 pounds and give it to another tribe  member who is now carrying twice as much weight. First tribe to catch the other tribe and tackle one of their tribe members to  the ground wins immunity, is safe at least one more day here in the Cook  Islands. Losers, tribal council tonight, somebody going home. There is one more element to this challenge. The details are in the note. It'll be revealed after the challenge is over. Make sense? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Get suited up, we'll  Probst: Get suited up, we'll go. go. Here we go, for immunity. Here we go, for immunity. Survivors, ready! Survivors, ready!

[ cheers and applause] [ cheers and applause] Safe from the vote, guaranteed  at least one more day out here. There is one more element to this challenge. I'll read the note. "The winning tribe will choose one member from the losing tribe to go to  Exile Island," which means the person you choose to send to Exile Island  will miss tribal council tonight. You are keeping somebody in this game. A lot of ways to play this strategically. Figure out who it is going to be. Do you have your decision? <br/>Candice. <br/>Probst: It was unanimous. Candice, boat will pick you up, have your stuff for you. have your stuff for you. Head on out. Head on out. Okay, Raro, you guys are safe from the vote. Everybody's good. Aitu, we have a date tonight at tribal council. One of the eight of you will be going home. You have the afternoon to figure out who that's going to be. be. Head on back to camp. Head on back to camp. <br/>Can we just take one second and think of why they picked Candice? <br/>I don't think they would perceive her as being the strongest physically, so I  think they're just protecting her. <br/>They're trying to protect her from us voting her off? <br/>Candice went to Exile Island. It has a huge effect on our plans. Prior to this, we had an alliance going on between myself, Jonathan, Becky,  Candice, and we were pretty confident that with the four of us pulling in one  other person we would have a numbers advantage. But now it doesn't look to be But now it doesn't look to be the case. the case. And actually...  I need you guys, too. We all need each other. We just need to win. <br/>But we have to obviously write down some...  We have to let Becky go. <br/>Okay. <br/>I think Becky is the weak  I think Becky is the weak link. link. <br/>All right. <br/>Cao Boi said alliance with us, he said we're good, the girls are good. He said he really liked you, you know, everybody... We got all [ inaudible]. I say we get rid of Becky. I say we get rid of Becky. Becky is seriously plotting. Becky is seriously plotting. <br/>All we need is five. We are all voting for Becky. Cao Boi, myself, Cecilia, Sundra and Flicka seem to have some sort of an  agreement, and some sort of an agreement, and we'll see if it stands. we'll see if it stands. <br/>Jonathan, what are you doing? <br/>Let's... Come here. Let's... Let's... I'll check in with you. I'll check in with you. <br/>No more talking. <br/>No more talking. We're done. We're done. <br/>I thought I had Flicka  I thought I had Flicka handled. handled. I thought she was with me. But she's not. She's doing her own thing, and I don't know how easy or hard it's going to be  to convince her otherwise. So we've got a serious problem here. Where do we stand right now? It's you, me, Becky and that's it. We don't know where Sundra's at. We don't know where Cao Boi's at. And Flicka is going to be probably impossible to switch. <br/>Really? <br/>We're good, right, from what we said. <br/>Yeah, yeah, we need to stick with it. But Jonathan is just worried because I'm not for sure saying that I'm a part  of their alliance because I don't want to be wishy washy. <br/>You're just going to follow your gut. <br/>We just have to make it through tonight. We've got to get Flicka or Cao Boi to vote for Cecilia. And it's risky because if we don't know that they are rock solid going to  vote our way, then you and I put our necks way then you and I put our necks  way out on the line. out on the line. Trying to convince Flicka and Cao Boi to vote with us is the key. If not, then all bets are off and it's going to be a whole different kettle  of fish. All I'm concerned about is making it to the merger. Everybody you like is going to get voted off. <br/>I know, it's not about that, though. It's about having trust in the people that you have a connection with. <br/>Okay, so I thought you and I had a tight thing. So we don't have such a tight thing. Do we not trust each other? We're talking like adults. <br/>I'm sorry. We have to let Becky go in total fairness. She's the weak link. Then we'll lose another one. <br/>She's not a weak link. <br/>She is. She a princess out here. You pay attention. She's a princess out here. I just watch and I just...  But she's not... she's not, like, weak. She's strong. I think she has been very strong and decisive on the challenges. I think if you look at Cecilia, she hasn't been that strong. She's good at puzzles, but physically she hasn't been that strong. <br/>If five of us vote for Cecilia tonight, okay, and three of you vote for  Becky, then all of a sudden you're on the outside and, boom, you're gone. <br/>If we get rid of Cecilia, we'll have our numbers, okay? We can decide later on whether we need to draw Becky, you, Jonathan, Flicka. That's five. That's a solid five. <br/>That's still not the point, though. <br/>Well, what is the point? I guess we're talking apples and oranges. <br/>Yeah, we kind of are, because I'm just thinking she's the weaker link and I'm  not there. <br/>I'm trying to think ahead of that. <br/>I'm not thinking ahead. I'm not...  But this is a game. This is like a chess game. <br/>Yeah, right. <br/>This is a 30 day... we have 30 more days ahead of us. You can't just think about tomorrow. You have to put yourself in a position that you can be there in 30 days. You have to think about that now. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>I mean, because otherwise you won't be there. you won't be there. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Uh-huh. Hmm. I don't know. I have to think about it still. <br/>We've got to stick tight. <br/>You present your point and, okay, I'll listen to you. <br/>I don't like the scheming of man. I really don't like that at all. I feel like I've always been blessed. Maybe this time I'm wrong. <br/>No matter what they said, I said, "I'm going to talk to Jessica  first." Okay. <br/>I have a hard time trusting...  I don't trust Jonathan. <br/>I don't trust Jonathan. <br/>He's manipulative. <br/>I had a good talk with her. She doesn't like the idea of playing the game that way. <br/>But Jonathan has a point, the numbers game. We have to make it to the merger. We can play the game some more. <br/>I don't want to be picked off. <br/>I know, but they are playing bad. You are not part of the crowd. I'm not part of the crowd, period. We're just stuck in this...  Now what do you do? I don't know what to do. I'm getting all wrapped up in this whole drama. I realize it's a numbers game, but I have a lot of respect for Ceci, so I  don't know. It's so hard. It's so hard. I'm like, ahh! I'm like, ahh! <br/>Two ways to play the game: "I like you, so I'm not going to vote for  you," or "Sorry, I like you, but I got to vote for you because I  want to go further." We have two different philosophies, and it's a war. I don't know. We'll see how convincing I've We'll see how convincing I've been. been. <br/>Probst: Go ahead and have a  Probst: Go ahead and have a seat. seat. So let's talk about the merge. Jonathan, in this case, the tribes have been divided based on ethnicity. Did that add anything to the merge? <br/>I didn't think so. Honestly, I didn't. I think the captains selected the strongest people they could given the  parameters. We had a sense of who was strong and I'm actually really pleased with the way  the merge went. <br/>Probst: Sundra, as the only person from one tribe, you suddenly can become  extremely powerful as everybody now wants your vote because you have no  allegiance to anyone. <br/>Yeah, I mean, you could say you are either vulnerable or valuable, and I  don't give credit to either. I just try to be there and just use my gut to say, "Okay, this is what I  should do," because, as you know, there's no way to guarantee the  results of playing this game. <br/>Probst: Yul, assess this tribe. What do you think would be the best direction for this tribe to head? <br/>My sense is that some people have different priorities in terms of what they  are looking for out of being here. I think some people are strategizing and trying to make alliances and came  here to play hard to win the game. I think other people came here, you know, hoping that this is going to be a  personally fulfilling experience for everyone. <br/>Probst: And Jonathan, nothing wrong or right about either one of those ends  of the continuum. <br/>Absolutely. Someone who's here to just have the experience and not play the game, they're  going to be playing the game. The game is happening with them in it. And people who are here who are strategizing, they're also dealing with the  personalities here and they're really in the experience. And that's what makes it interesting is that none of us are thinking about it  exactly the same way. Otherwise, it would be pretty boring, I think. <br/>Probst: So Jessica, eight days in, is this game already more complicated than  you anticipated? <br/>I think that I'm just not used to the manipulation aspect of it, and just  where people's intentions are gets really confusing to me. Like, are you really telling me because you're being nice or are you telling  me this because you're, like, trying to get me on your side so you could,  like, get me to, like, vote somebody off who I like, you know? It's just weird, because I'm not ready to lose one of our members of our  tribe yet. <br/>Probst: Ozzy, how is this tribe going to be different after tonight's vote? <br/>Well, I'm going to... after tonight's vote, I'm going to know where people  actually stand as to what they were saying before. So that's pretty much how it's going to go. <br/>Probst: Before we get to the vote, two of you have been to Exile Island. The hidden immunity idol might have been found. Just to be clear, here's how it works: if the person in possession of the  idol receives the highest number of votes, you present that idol to me after  the vote, you're back in the game. And the person with the next highest number of votes goes home. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Yul, you're up. Yul, you're up. <br/>Cecilia, I'm really sorry to be sending you home. And the vote was either going to go against Becky or yourself. And between the two, my loyalty is to Becky. is to Becky. Best of luck to you. Best of luck to you. <br/>It's nothing personal. I think you're amazing. It's what I think will be It's what I think will be better for the tribe. better for the tribe. <br/>It's nothing personal, girl. I'm just doing this as far as strategy for moving the tribe strategy for  moving the tribe forward in this game. forward in this game. <br/>You haven't made any effort to try and connect to me, get to try and connect  to me, get to know me at all. to know me at all. <br/>You're a very classy lady. This is nothing personal. This is nothing personal. It's just strategy. It's just strategy. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. council area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes.

Cecilia, the tribe has spoken. Well, one thing is clear, this tribe is definitely not unified. And only eight days in to a game this unpredictable, certainly risky. Grab your torches.

That just doesn't fly with me at all. <br/>Probst: And at Aitu, Cao Boi goes too far. <br/>Oh, my God, a little chick. Cao Boi is such a wild card. I wouldn't trust him. I wouldn't trust him.

It's just a testament as to how quickly the game can change. But I have no regrets. I had a great time. It was an amazing eight days. I got to do crazy things that I never thought I would ever do and probably  won't ever do again. I think that they made a mistake voting me out. I don't think this is going to strengthen them. It may weaken the tribe, It may weaken the tribe, unfortunately.
