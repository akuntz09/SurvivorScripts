<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor... After their third  consecutive Tribal Council, Ulong was desperate. <br/>I'm gonna stomp anybody's ass that lags. <br/>Tree mail. <br/>Probst: The tribes had a big decision to make. <br/>"Today you must choose one tribal representative..."  I'll speak right out...  Probst: At Koror, Tom spoke for the tribe and chose Ian as  their representative. <br/>Ian, I say you go. <br/>Probst: But the decision exposed a divide in the tribe. <br/>Katie, Jennifer, Gregg, Ian and Tom are one unit. So that makes five against four. We're definitely the underdogs here. <br/>Maybe we'll draw straws or something. <br/>Probst: At Ulong, the tribe couldn't make a decision. You guys don't have a leader, you can't even pick a  representative. Give me somebody. <br/>James. <br/>James. <br/>James. <br/>I wasn't trying to be the leader, they picked me. <br/>Probst: The tribes competed in a bathroom build-off. We're going to judge your bathroom. For the winning tribe, our entire construction department will  build a shelter. will build a shelter. Both tribes squared off. Both tribes squared off. <br/>Jenn, is that a boat coming? <br/>Probst: And in the end, it was Koror that won the new  shelter. <br/>Oh, it's a frickin' palace. It's like the Taj Mahal. It's fantastic. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, Ulong was out for  revenge. <br/>We're not going back to Tribal Council! <br/>Probst: The Ulong women held their own... Jenn is in! Steph wins. ...but the men faltered. Koror wins their fourth straight immunity challenge. Back at Ulong...  I have never lost this bad. <br/>Probst: ...the girls were frustrated and wanted James out. <br/>James lost it for all of us. <br/>Probst: But Kim was on the chopping block as well. <br/>She sits on her butt. She might drink some coconut juice, you know. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, the women ultimately sided with  the men... Fourth person voted out of Survivor: Palau... ...and voted out the  weakest link. 14 are left. 14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? [theme song playing] [theme song playing] [theme song playing] Your shoulder's right on my head. head. [laughing] [laughing] [giggling] [giggling]  Don't do that to yourself. <br/>Don't do that to yourself. [giggling] [giggling] [giggling]  In the shelter, people have teamed off, and Jennifer and  Gregg have definitely teamed off. I mean, Jennifer had her hand on Gregg's stomach, rubbing on it. I mean, it's very obvious. And they won't admit how close they're getting. But we can all see it. They got to think we're stupid if we can't tell that they're  together. <br/>Willard's in the hammock. <br/>Willard...! Where are you? <br/>Nice. <br/>Can you see the fire? You're in charge. Willard... You're in charge of the fire You're in charge of the  fire unless you wake somebody up. unless you wake somebody up. <br/>Y'all ready? <br/>Hold up, hold up. <br/>I don't know that we need the machete. <br/>We don't need it. <br/>I've got the bag. <br/>You might need it for something. [thunder]  Everybody in line now. Let's go. <br/>We get back from Tribal Council, and it's James and Bobby  Jon's idea to go find the cave because it's going to rain. <br/>A tree sticking out. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. It's really bad. <br/>Where the hell are we going? <br/>Trying to get to the cave. <br/>This is the wrong way. <br/>The cave is 300 yards from the shelter. I was the one trying to lead us through there. And I've never really been real lost before in the wilderness,  especially at night. Here's the trail, dude. <br/>You on the trail? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>That's not the trail. <br/>Y'all, watch out. <br/>There's a wall in front of us, right? See this here, that's a rock. <br/>That's a wall. <br/>I think we're totally lost. <br/>Come on y'all, this is an adventure. <br/>I just don't want anybody to get hurt. We're already...  Ain't nobody gonna get hurt. [thunder] It's gonna be a tree up here. <br/>Where are we going? <br/>Come on, you have a better way to get back there? I can't see. Can you see? <br/>No. <br/>Well, I'm trying, baby. But don't get on down my throat, 'cause I don't know what's  going on either. I'm trying to stay dry, I'm trying to help out. You know what I'm saying? <br/>Bobby Jon and James were gung ho about it and I thought it  was insane. It's the middle of the night, we can't find that cave. We're going around in circles for, like, an hour. <br/>Are we supposed to keep bearing left? <br/>I'm going back to camp. <br/>Why are you going to go back to camp by yourself? <br/>You can't. <br/>Why can't I? Who says I have to go with you guys and get lost in the jungle? I don't want to get lost in the jungle. <br/>Angie wanted to quit. She's one of those folks that says, "I can't do this,"  you know, "I'm never going to find it." Okay, never say  "never." [thunder]  Oh, my God. <br/>We don't want to go back to get wet. <br/>I'm just scared to get struck by lightning. We're in the middle of a freakin' jungle. This is, like, the last place they say to be. Let's just go back. Everybody walk that way, go. After about an hour in the dark, we were all tired. Our feet were killing us. And we came back to our shelter and it poured all night. [thunder]  We cannot quit. We cannot falter. Y'all want to win, do not quit! <br/>Amen. <br/>Amen. <br/>A-Amen. <br/>A-Amen. <br/>It's gray all the way back. There's more rain coming. <br/>Feel like I slept in a mud  Feel like I slept in a mud hole. hole. <br/>I'm just feeling really miserable this morning. No sleep. We're all freezing. It's miserable. Today doesn't look like it's going to be shaping up too well. It's pretty dark and stormy looking. looking. This is a rough one. This is a rough one. <br/>It was a tough night. It was a little grumpy this morning, you know. It comes from lack of sleep and you being the guy up tending the  fire all night. To make matters worse, I had to climb over Willard sleeping in  the hammock each time I had to get up and tend the fire. We made so many hints to Willard about, you know, we all have to  help with the fire. Either he's playing a game where he's wearing me down by making  me stay up all night, or he's just got the kind of attitude where, "Why  should I do it if somebody else is going to do it for me?" You know, I  mean, because of his age, he can't contribute a lot. But he can come out here and put another log on the fire. <br/>He's had plenty of time and energy to think about what his  role is in this game, and the longer you keep him around, the more likely he  is to screw you. <br/>Right. It's discouraging. <br/>What an ass. <br/>Imagine putting up with that in the real world? <br/>Oh, God. <br/>I mean, it's just, like... You have to bite your tongue  here and just keep playing the game, and it just infuriates you. You just want to unload on the guy. You know, tell him where he belongs. <br/>Since we keep winning immunity, you don't really have to  play, you know, the voting, the alliance part of the game. Everyone's sitting pretty, we keep winning. Koror keeps getting stronger. So in a way, because we've been winning all these immunity  challenges, Willard has been getting a free ride. And he's been able to play this game a lot longer to play this  game a lot longer than he should. than he should. <br/>Probst: Welcome, guys. You guys ready to get to today's challenge? Here's how it's going to work. Both tribes are going to race out to a Japanese shipwreck to  retrieve sake bottles from the bottom of the ocean. Using a pulley system, each tribe will pull one tribe member out  to a buoy. Directly underneath the buoy is a shipwreck. Scattered amongst the shipwreck are 14 sake bottles. When you hit the buoy, a tribe member will dive down, release  the sake bottle, come back up, get back on the skiff and their tribe will  pull them back to the start where another tribe member will get on and do the  same thing. The first tribe to collect six sake bottles wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Good news is the winning tribe will eat tonight. <br/>Oh...  Probst: Now, for bad the news. You'll be dining at Tribal Council, because win or lose, both  tribes are going to Tribal Council tonight, both tribes will vote one tribe  member out. The winning tribe will go to Tribal Council and vote somebody  out. They will then cross to the jury side, help themselves to some  stew and root beer and listen in as the losing tribe has their Tribal  Council. In a game in which knowledge is power, the winning tribe will  leave Tribal Council with a full belly and some potentially vital information  to help them later in the game. Everybody clear on this? Koror, you have four extra members. You're sitting four people out. Who is it going to be? <br/>Willard, Caryn, Katie and Janu are sitting out. <br/>Probst: All right, those four take a spot in the boat,  take a spot in the boat, everybody else, wait for my go. everybody else, wait for my go. For reward, survivors ready? Go! Steph and Jen first on the Steph and Jen first on the skiffs. skiffs. Ulong with a bit of a lead. Steph first to the buoy, and she's down. and she's down.

Koror wins reward! [whooping] [whooping]  All right! <br/>Probst: Frustrated Steph. Right. Here's how it's going to work tonight. Koror, you will go to Tribal Council first, where you will vote  somebody out of your tribe. You will then move to the jury section and eat stew as you  listen in on Ulong's Tribal Council where they will vote another member out  of their tribe. Get in your outriggers, head Get in your outriggers, head back  to camp. back to camp. back to camp. [cheering] [cheering] Nice job again, everyone. [growling like pirates]  Today was, was one we had to win as a team, and we did,  and unfortunately, both tribes have to vote one member out tonight. Poor Ulong is really getting decimated. I mean, there's gonna be four of them left and there'll be eight  of us left. It's just a good thing Ibrehem didn't do as well as he should  have. <br/>Doesn't matter. Even if he had gotten one, we would still have been ahead of  them. <br/>The nice thing is we get to watch Ulong do it and see kind  of, where the, where the, uh, the feelings are and where the strategy is,  and, I mean, tonight a party in my mouth is gonna be had. Oh, God, I'm so excited. I speak Kororese. <br/>Kororean. <br/>Kororean. <br/>Can I make another suggestion, too? Tonight we're going to have to eat in front of them. Can we be nice about it and not giggle and laugh and moan so  much? <br/>We're all 21. I don't have to go clamming today... I don't have to go play in  the bay. [people laughing]  Who brought this guy? Whose friend is he? Don't have to go and find seashells. Poor Ulong is in the Survivor hell. hell. <br/>You're crazy. <br/>You're crazy. <br/>At the challenge, we had it in the bag. Then... Ibrehem. We lost because of him. He gave up. His heart wasn't in it. If his heart was in it, he would have told us, "Look, I  can't do it," you know? That would have been the manly thing to do. <br/>I can't believe we've lost. <br/>Beef stew, you know? <br/>I might throw up sitting there watching them eat it, I  really might. <br/>Everything happens for a reason, though. You got to think like that. <br/>It was such a joke. <br/>Yeah. We gotta suffer. He's his-tor-y. <br/>I've been an athlete my entire life. I'm just not a good loser. I just, I don't understand how this tribe continues to lose the  way it does, and I'm not good with it, I'm not good with losing. I don't know how much more I can take of it. I'm just hoping for a merge really. I'm going to get water. <br/>Who's going for the craft? I pretty much lost it for the whole team. I guess I panicked a little bit and felt like I was taking too  much time. And that kind of threw it for us. us. I single-handedly lost that one. I single-handedly lost that one. I admit it. All the other challenges, I gave my all. I never quit, but I definitely think I'm probably the number one  target right now. If you can, let me know what's up. <br/>I will. <br/>You know what I'm saying. <br/>I will. <br/>Keep me informed. I know you've got my back. <br/>I got it, you know. It's just, boy, you know, the cookie crumbles. You got that? <br/>Appreciate it. <br/>As much as I do like him and, and as much as I've grown to  know him, it's fair to know him, it's fair to vote Ibrehem tonight. to vote Ibrehem tonight. <br/>I've said before, the first time we get to immunity, I  very well may have a problem. And here we are. There are situations that can't be turned around. It's like trying to fight gravity or King Canute saying, "I  want the tide to stop." The tide ain't going to stop and gravity ain't  going to shut off. <br/>What's up, big boy? <br/>I just came by. Uh... I think I'm going tonight. Do you, can you fit into my shorts? <br/>Oh... Willard. Don't make me sad. Probably. <br/>You know, it's a game, I had fun. I had bad moments, good moments. I couldn't play as hard as I want because of physical reasons,  but it's been okay. <br/>Just makes me so mad, if you go before Katie. She's so worthless. But what can we do? <br/>It's okay. It's, it's a game of, of personalities, and I have almost no  ability to schmooze. I mean, I just don't have it. And you end up with my pants, there's something wrong with this  game. <br/>And I get a shirt. I get a shirt back. <br/>Well, that's your shirt. <br/>I could absolutely say with 100% certainty, tonight will  be Willard, and I don't have the numbers, I can't change those other peoples'  minds, it's not gonna happen. All it'll do is set me apart from the tribe, and like I said,  it's a popularity contest. If I act like a bitch, nobody's gonna like me. I'm not going to stick around. <br/>Everybody's favorite curmudgeon. <br/>"Curmudgeon," that's a good word. <br/>Yes, it is. <br/>The only person pissing me off is Katie, but nobody'll do  anything about it. She doesn't do anything, and she's still here. I don't even care how far I get in the game, but if Katie gets  further than me, I will gets further than me, I will just puke, puke, puke. just puke, puke, puke. You want to walk? <br/>Yeah, I'm cool. You want to walk? Which way? That way? <br/>Sure. Don't... don't tell anybody this. <br/>I won't. <br/>Because I trust you, and we've built a relationship. And I think what's good about this is it's an equal benefit for  both you and me. <br/>I agree. <br/>Right now, there's, like, a soft alliance between me,  Tom...  Ian, Katie...  Um... Ian, Katie and Jenn. <br/>Right. <br/>And Tom and Ian are really just strong, and that bond is  just too tight, you know? Jenn and I feel like we're on the outside of that alliance. <br/>Right. <br/>And we feel, like, once Willard and Caryn are gone, if it  comes to seven people, then we switch-- me, Jenn, you and Janu. And then we start picking them off. <br/>The main interesting thing that happened today... was with  Ken and Barbie. Gregg basically told me, secretly-- and not to tell anybody, and  I won't-- that him and Jennifer want to make a secret alliance to the top  four with me and Janu. And they want to pick everybody else off, including Tom and Ian. <br/>Tom especially? <br/>Tom especially. <br/>Tom's my biggest bull's-eye right now. I want Tom off. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>What? Out of the blue! <br/>I... I'm in a good situation because I can be part of that  five-person alliance and get information from them and control them. <br/>The game is now just now getting interesting now that  we're having to vote people off. I'm very excited. I love that the game is going to a new level. a new level. I can't wait. I can't wait. <br/>So we're good? Everything's cool, right? <br/>Yep. We got the plan. <br/>Right. <br/>And I think, you know...  Right. <br/>Willard seems to have a good attitude about it, too. <br/>Right. Nobody wants to go home, but you got to do it with a stiff upper  lip also, as most of us will at one time or another. <br/>So Jenn and I are in the middle to navigate which way we  really want to go, we really want to go, and that's a luxury. and that's a luxury. If we wanted to, we could flip from the Katie, Tom and Ian side  to the Janu and Coby side. And we could start picking off who I perceive to be the bigger  strengths in Tom and Ian. Jenn and I-- people look at us as, oh, we're just, like, a cute  couple. Well, I think we're thinking Well, I think we're thinking a hell  of a lot more than them. a hell of a lot more than them. <br/>Probst: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch, and approach the flame. Dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council. As long as you have fire, you're still in the game. When your fire is gone, so are you. That will be the case for one of you tonight. So we have a lot to cover. Let's talk about relationships, leadership, friendship. Katie, who's leading this tribe right now? <br/>Depends how you want to define "leader." At  challenges, Tom definitely is a leader. If you're looking at leader as someone that provides food,  that's Ian. <br/>Probst: Tom, did you come in here to be the leader? <br/>My intention was to come in here, be the 40-year-old dad,  fade into the background. I ended up in a tribe initially physically weaker than the other  tribe. And every one of us had to turn it on 110% to win those  immunities. And we see the results. <br/>Probst: Coby, are you social with this tribe? <br/>I'm very social... which could bite me in the end. I get along with everybody. You know, when you're too friendly, and you're too busy of a  bee, people watch you too much, I guess. <br/>Probst: So what do you do to... to counter that? <br/>I don't care. I'm just being me. I am social. I am a butterfly. I do want to talk to everybody. So I just do it, and if that costs me the game in the end, well,  so be it. <br/>Probst: Gregg, what friendships have you seen develop? Are you starting to notice just a natural bonding between  people? <br/>You definitely see that. Tom and Ian spend a lot of time together. You know, it's like a father-son relationship. <br/>I'm the father. <br/>But, at the same time, we all appreciate that, you know? It's not something that's hidden or secretive. Coby and Janu have been getting along great. And Willard and Caryn have been getting along great. Katie's been spreading the wealth. She's been, you know, loving everyone, and everyone's enjoying  her company. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Where does that leave Jenn and Gregg? <br/>So, you know, that leaves me and Jenn alone. <br/>Probst: So that's a different type of friendship then? <br/>We have a strong bond, just as everyone else here, and  it's nothing you know, super intense at this point. <br/>Probst: Willard, how do you think you are perceived? Probably as one of the weaker players on the team. I'm not as strong as I thought I'd be. And I think people understand that. Not a good position to be in. <br/>Probst: Gregg, at this point, how big an issue does trust  become? <br/>It's about to kick in. It's about to really kick in. This is our first time here, and now we're faced with the  reality of voting people off, and so the trust that we think that we have or  hope that we have is going to be tested because it hasn't been tested yet. <br/>Probst: Okay, it is time to vote. vote. Willard, you're up. Willard, you're up. <br/>You're crabby and you're bitter. bitter. Bye. Bye. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final-- person voted  out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... First vote... Katie. Katie. Willard-- one vote Katie, Willard-- one vote Katie, one vote  Willard. one vote Willard. Willard-- two votes Willard, one vote Katie. Willard-- that's three votes Willard-- that's three votes  Willard. Willard. Willard-- four votes Willard. One vote Katie. Fifth person voted out of Survivor: Palau, Willard. That's five, that's enough. That's five, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Willard, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. <br/>Stay strong, stick to the plan, finish them off. plan, finish them off. [several saying farewells] [several saying farewells]  Probst: Okay, Koror, you are now a tribe of eight. Willard voted out. Your work here is done for your voting. We'll now bring in the Ulong tribe. You can then partake in your reward. Grab your torches. Grab your torches. Cross over to the jury side. Cross over to the jury side. <br/>I surprised myself out here by not being quite as strong  as I expected to be. There are times I get crabby, and I know that can bother people. But there has been many years since I've been in a situation  where I'm deprived of water and sleep. I think the tribe as a whole I think the tribe as a whole are  good people by and large. are good people by and large. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the Ulong tribe... who I'm sure  is going who I'm sure is going to enjoy this. to enjoy this. Koror, go ahead and pull off the cover. [all expressing awe] Biscuits! [singing]  Probst: Stew, bread, and root beer. [all expressing awe]  Oh, it smells so delicious. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Pass it out. <br/>Pass it out. <br/>It smells so good. <br/>Let's all wait to eat. Get excited, Tom. <br/>Oh, I am, I am. <br/>Don't be bashful. Don't be bashful; I'm a skinny man. <br/>We get two a piece, it looks like. [Ian chuckles]  Oh, my God. <br/>Yes! I think I'm going to cry. Are you all going to cry? <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Probst: Just so we're all clear, part of Koror's reward  was to be here for Tribal Council tonight to listen in, potentially gather  information that will help them later in the game. They're not going to be asking questions, just listening... and  eating. First question I have is, it seems as though you brought your  entire camp. You brought shovels, you brought your Home Depot kit. Why is that, Bobby Jon? <br/>I mean, we don't ever know what's going to happen next. We don't know if we're gonna merge. We decided we'd bring everything, and if we have to take it  back, then we'll take it back, but... I'm sure we've got to take it back. <br/>Probst: Yeah, we're not merging. Angie, are you hiding your face because you can't stand to look  at the food? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: You're genuinely upset. Is it frustration? Are you sad? Are you...? <br/>I'm frustrated. I'm so frustrated. I mean, it was really close today. We really... we needed this. And it's not just like today was a loss of food. It was a loss of, like, you know... winning today would have  been a real big boost to team morale. It's not all about the food. It's just that after consistently losing, it would have been  nice to win, and win something we all wanted. <br/>Probst: Stef, how is it for you? <br/>It makes me sick. It makes me sick to know that we would have been eating a nice  meal. We almost had it in the palm of our hands except for one  mistake. We had a great lead and blew it all away. It's hard. I can't even look over there. I don't even know who got voted out. <br/>Probst: James, you guys have hung in there. You've tried to keep a good attitude. Today looked like it put a knife in the back of this tribe. <br/>We wanted it, man. Our desire was there. We was pulling as hard as we could. As fast as we could just to get this one reward. We all wanted it. Ever since we've been starving. It was disappointing. <br/>Probst: Ibrehem? <br/>You know, everyone's really emotional right now. All they're thinking about is what's the last challenge. I mean, I can go back to other challenges where other people  haven't done as well, but that's just not the way I do business. I guess I wish people would kind of look collectively at how  I've done in challenges. Then put it together rather than just put your fate at one  challenge, and if you've made one mistake, too bad.
