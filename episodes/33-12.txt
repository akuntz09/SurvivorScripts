<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," Zeke's alliance  had a numbers advantage. Over David's coalition. <br/>The five isn't going to pick us off one by one. <br/>Jeff: But will was ready to graduate from high school  student to power player. <br/>Tonight's the night. <br/>I came here to play. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Adam played his idol. <br/>I’m playing this for Hannah. <br/>What? <br/>Jeff: But his move proved unnecessary when will flipped to  David's side. <br/>Jeff: Zeke, the tribe has spoKen. Leaving Jay with the only idol left in the game. Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Great move, will. <br/>Nice job. <br/>I came into this game a  kid, and I feel like I’m leaving this tribal the man. <br/>Billing your resume, young man. <br/>I opened up every door  possible for me. Everybody needs me in this game, and I believe I can start  flip-flopping back and forth enough times to win this game. <br/>Making big moves, huh? That's what it is? Everyone is going to stack up big moves. How about get to the three? It's a $1 million prize. Why would you vote Zeke before dave? <br/>I don't know. <br/>I’m used to tribal  council going my way. Again it didn't go my way. Will flipped and voted out Zeke. He said, I want to make some big moves in this game. This kid wants everyone to think he's not just a high school  kid, but he's thinking like a high school kid. I got to do my homework. I have to check off all these boxes. Give me a break. <br/>This is getting to be a crazy game. And there's a lot of people playing it. There has to be a way for me to stay alive in this game. <br/>Listen, Zeke was a huge threat. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We just got rid of him. Now there are a couple more threats left in this game. Jay, I’m talking about will, dave. Dave's a huge threat. If those three people make it to the final three, I’m not  winning. I might as well go back and eat cake right now, you know what I’m  saying? <br/>Bret and Sunday come up to me and say dave, Jay and will  are the three biggest threats in the game, those three need to be the next to  go. And it's music to my ears. <br/>The question is who do you take out first? <br/>I don't know, who is more  important to take out? <br/>I don't know. <br/>Us three are very equal. We can go far and get to the end. <br/>If they want to put themselves in a position where they're  left with myself, Hannah and Ken, I love that. <br/>Okay. <br/>They have to be the next three. <br/>They have to be the next three. [ theme song playing]  Jeff: Come on in, guys. <br/>This looks involved. <br/>Jeff: All right. So we get to today's immunity challenge. First things first, take it back. <br/>You have to grab it. I'm not going to give it up. <br/>Jeff: Fair enough. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge you're going to race out to a group of  disks. You'll stack them and then transport them over a balance beam  and through a wire maze. Once you have all ten disks at the finish, you'll attempt to  roll them into a target. First to finish wins immunity, safe from the vote, guaranteed a  one in seven shot at winning this game. Losers, tribal council, somebody will become the sixth member of  our jury. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! First step is to untie that pole and start stacking your disks. You can take one or ten. The fewer trips the better, but if you drop, you have to come  back and start again. Bret quickly out of the gate. David heading out. Everybody heading out now. Sunday immediately drops and has to come back. Now you've got to get across the balance beam. It takes a lot of coordination to balance on a beam carrying  that stack. David quickly over the balance beam. Bret is over the balance beam. He's going to drop and head back for more. Ken is over the balance beam. Jay is clear. Will drops. He's got to go back. Adam is after his first four. Sunday and Hannah moving slowly. It's now David, Ken, Bret and Jay all with their remaining disks. David whipping over that beam quickly. Bret falls off. He's got to go all the way back. David is back. Ken drops. He's good. Now you're moving into the second phase, where you will use a  staff and have to get through a wire maze. How many can you put on each side and feel safe? David heading out through the second phase. Not only do you have to navigate the wires, you also have to  step over the ropes. Very difficult to maintain your balance during this. Adam is good. He can start on his second phase. It is now will the only person who cannot get through that first  phase. Everybody else working on the second phase. Nobody took all ten disks at once. So everybody will have to make at least two runs. Bret is the first one through. He's got four. You're good, get them on there and head back. It's now Bret in the lead. Hereby comes Jay with his first stick. David near the end of the wire maze. Jay is good. He can head back for his last four. It's now Bret and Jay in the lead. Ken is back. Adam heading back. Sunday and Hannah falling out of this quickly, and will still  back at the beginning of this challenge. <br/>Yeah, thanks, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Jay is the first one through. Here's David. He's through now. Jay has all ten disks. He's in the final phase, rolling them enter a target. He's got one. He has to get all ten in there. David, he can start rolling. Bret is finished. He can start rolling. It is now Jay, Bret and David. David has one. David has another. Another one for Jay. Jay getting hot. He's got four. Bret gets one. Jay with another. That's five for Jay. Make it six for Jay. Just misses. Jay, Bret, dave all rolling disks now. There's another for Bret. It is six for Jay, two for Bret, two for David. There's a seventh. Eighth. Ninth. One left for Jay for the win and right here. He does it. Jay wins individual immunity, safe from tribal council. <br/>Good job, man. <br/>Jeff: Huge effort. Jay, come on over. <br/>Good job, Jay. <br/>Good job, Jay. <br/>Thank you. Jay safe from the vote tonight. Cannot be voted out of this game. Will live to see day 35. As for the rest of you, somebody going home tonight will become  the sixth member of our jury. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at triballen congrats. <br/>Thank you, sir. <br/>It felt phenomenal to win. I've already won two individual challenges, but any time Jeff  says, "Jay wins immunity," I’m like, damn right I won immunity. Put that thing around my neck. I'll go spearfishing if I want to, and I don't even have to talk  to any of these fools. Plus I still have my idol, and I’m going to hold on to this baby  until I really have to use it. <br/>Good job, Jay. <br/>Thank you. <br/>That was fun. Nice job, Jay. <br/>Thank you. Thank you. <br/>Jay again, you know, three of the last four challenge he's  won. He got the immunity challenge today, and we would have probably  targeted Jay tonight had he not won, but now we don't know how this game is  going on. You never know from one day to the next, so tonight is  completely up in the air. <br/>See how David's kind of like dying basically, he can't win  a challenge. Ken can. <br/>David is a weasel that will beat us all in the end. If Ken somehow comes to the end, it's not even a contest. <br/>Okay. I'm down. You want the take David out before Ken? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I feel like I have a working  relationship with every single person that's in the game. People want my vote. People want my input. I'm done being afraid. <br/>Okay. I'm good with that. <br/>So I have to talk to people and get people the realize  that David's the kind of guy where if he gets to the end, he will beat  anybody, and that includes me, which means for me I need him out of this  game. <br/>I think we just go for David. <br/>I agree, let's get David  out of this thing. I'm with you. <br/>I need them to feel like  I’m an equal contributor here. At the end of the day they're not l I’m the one calling the  shots. <br/>So many conversations are happening. Unfortunately, because Jay is now safe tonight at tribal, there  is so much scrambling going around, and the most insecurity I've ever felt is  right now. I just hope I survive tonight. <br/>I do, too. <br/>At the last tribal will voted with us, which was great. But the thing is will is looking to pad his resume a little  more. The thing to do is follow up a big move with another big move. And there's this perception in the tribe that I’m the biggest  threat in the game, and so, yeah, why wouldn't you want to get rid of me  tonight? <br/>Can I just talk to you? <br/>I’m with you guys. <br/>Totally. Will's preference right off the bat is obviously to vote out  dave next. Will thinks now he has a degree of power, and he's in control. And that makes him more dangerous, so to me, will is a bigger  threat, and I do not want to put myself in a position where will is, you  know, controlling my fate in this game. Will I think genuinely wants to go far with me, but I’m not  interested in that. And I don't want to work with someone who is going to flip back  and forth, so the plan is I’m voting will tonight. <br/>Okay. I think Adam has been smart with how he's been playing. We have some common goals, so me and Sunday agree, we'll go with  Adam and vote together. <br/>They are going to vote out will. <br/>Does this feel like this is a right move from someone who  just rescued us from a really bad situation? We were screwed. His alliance was going to take us all out, and I was going home. I get that he did it for his own game, but, you know...  I’m torn up, as I always  am emotionally, because will saved my butt in this game. So it's like, I do owe will, in a sense, but I also feel like I owe  David in a sense. David pulled a rock for me, and we have always been allies. So, you know, you end up owing more than one person. Dave could flip because he knows we're not going to beat him in  the end. <br/>He's going to have to keep moving in order to stay in this  game. So we may have to actually do David next. So what do you want to do? <br/>Right now Hannah and I are in power positions. We can decide who goes home next. It's a really tough choice. Bret and Sunday are in a weak position. They're going to vote the way I want them to vote. So the question is: Blind side will and take out someone who I do  believe is loyal to me at this point, or try to blind side dave and take out  potentially the biggest threat in this game? So we have a huge decision to make tonight. This is the moment where I start making the moves that I need to  make to win this game. Make to win this game. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Michelle, Taylor, Chris, Jessica and Zeke voted out at the last  tribal council. So, will, last tribal council, everything centered ash -- around  you. You were the swing vote. You wanted to show your play. You made a big move, took out Zeke. What was the reaction when you got bang the camp. <br/>I wrote his name down,  and then Adam also played an idol when he didn't have to, and that caused a  lot of stir around camp, sure. <br/>Jeff: Jay, how did will's move shake out when you guys got  back to camp? <br/>I was proud of him as a  fan, but as a player it sucked. <br/>Jeff: So David, will makes a big move. It was 4-4. What does it do to the game? <br/>Well, I have concerns that it might be me. <br/>Jeff: Jay, should David be worried? <br/>I mean, considering the  last vote, will went with that side of the two alliance, so if they trust in  will, then will should be sticking with them, shouldn't he? <br/>Jeff: Hannah, what was your takeaway from will's move in  terms of what it does to the game and the numbers and the alliances? <br/>Almost everyone up here has both worked with people up  here and also worked against people up here. And I think you want to play with people who want to play with  you and take out those threats left in the game. <br/>Jeff: Adam, it's really tricky. It all comes down to how do I get to the end and who do I take  with me. <br/>I mean, you think about  who you want to sit next to at the end, but you also think about what's my  best way to get there. And a lot of the jury members made some really good moves in  this game, and it probably contributed to them getting voted out, so you have  the weigh both options. <br/>Jeff: It's a double-edged sword. You make a big move, great, now you're a bigger threat, watch  out. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: David, that does really sum up where this season is. It's going to be very hard to win this game if you don't have a  resume. Just being a nice person will not get it done, and yet every  time you make a move, you also have everybody else going, yeah, that might be  one too many. <br/>It's a complicated game, and the thing is, if you don't  make big moves, then you're just a goat, and then you maybe make it to the  final tribal, but you're not going to get the million dollars. So it's really essential to make big moves as much as it does  put a gigantic target on your back. <br/>Meaghan: Jay, what do you think will happen tonight? Because the if I’m watching at home, I have no idea with this  group who is going home tonight. <br/>You know, considering, Jeff, everyone here is a player, I honestly  am wondering who could it be. They could go with an easy vote or someone could be trying to  make a big move again. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Will, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote David. David. Two votes David. Will. Will. We're tied, two votes David, two votes will. Will. That's three votes will, two votes David. Will. That's four votes will, two votes David. 13th person voted out and the sixth member of our jury, will. That's five, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Will, the tribe has spoKen. <br/>Had a blast, guys. Good luck to all of you. <br/>Thank you, will. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thanks, man. <br/>Jeff: Well, with the game being played at this level, the  natural instinct is to want to hide, but in order to win this season, you  must be seen. Grab your torch, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Getting voted off of "Survivor" is not something  I wanted on my "Survivor" resume, but I am the youngest person to  ever play "Survivor," and to be able to experience this is the most  amazing thing that has ever happened to me so far in my life. <br/>Thanks a lot, guys. That worked. Thanks a lot. <br/>Dude, any time that someone tries to make a plan with me,  they end up going home. I'm like the black plague right now, you know what I’m saying? I am all alone. I have no alliance. But tribal council has been a complete chaotic mess every single  time. You never know what's going to happen. So time for the underdog to keep fighting, because I’m not going  down without a fight. I still have an idol. There are still immunities on the way, and I’m not going down. <br/>I’m sorry that I lied to  you again. <br/>I respect you fully. You and I, like it's honestly crazy. It's sick. It's a sick relationship. <br/>Me and Adam have this, it's kind of like a ying yang  relationship where we love each other but we hate each other. That's how it's been. <br/>What's your game, Adam, take David to the end? Because he's going to take you out, dude. <br/>Well, I hope not. <br/>He almost he's not taking you to the end, and you can't  beat David. <br/>I’m not planning on  taking David to the end. <br/>I’m trying to make Jay  feel as comfortable as possible with me, and so I tell Jay that the next move  is to get rid of dave, but to me Jay has to go home. <br/>You have an idol. <br/>Yeah. I'm not going home. <br/>I know. <br/>I'll take you to the end if I win. <br/>He has a hidden immunity idol. We have to take every opportunity we have to take a stab at the  guy. If he doesn't have immunity, he needs to go home. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. <br/>Jeff: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First things first. Jay, it's becoming familiar. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Jeff: I'll take it back. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to solve a block puzzle, but  there is a twist. You'll have a timer in the form of a "Survivor"  pinball table. Here's how it works: You're going to roll your ball. As long as the ball is making its way down the table, you can  work on solving the puzzle. When the ball reaches the bottom, you catch it, roll it again,  go back the your puzzle. If, however, the ball drops before you catch it, there is a time  penalty as the ball slowly makes its way to the bottom. During which you cannot work on your puzzle. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: So it becomes a challenge of split focus. You have to focus on the puzzle in order to solve it, but you  also have to focus on where the ball is on the table. The first to finish their puzzle wins immunity, guaranteed a one  in six shot at winning this game. Losers tribal council where somebody will become the seventh  member of our jury. Big stakes, fun challenge, let's do it. Draw for spots. Get started. All right. Here we go, for immunity, one in six shot, Survivors ready? Go! You got the roll the ball, and while the ball is in play, you  can started working on your puzzle. Bret having trouble just getting the ball up there. It's going to take a bit of a learning curve. Jay is the first to feel the time penalty. He now cannot work on his time puzzle until that ball slowly  makes its way to the bottom, and I mean slowly. Just happened to David. He's got to wait. A puzzle that would normally take a fair amount of time is going  to take a lot of time. Because your focus is split. You can only think about this puzzle while part of your brain is  thinking about where that ball is. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Hannah just misses her ball. It drops. She's got to wait. If your ball drops, you got to make use of the time. Adam just misses. He can't get to his ball. Ken drops. He's got to wait. And, oh, it's so slow how that ball makes its way down that  track. <br/>This is so hard. <br/>Jeff: All you can do while your ball is out of play is  study your puzzle, see if you can figure out your next move. David's starting to make some progress on his puzzle. Hannah making some progress. Jay doing a nice job with his puzzle. Jay drops again. Cannot work. Ken now back at it. He's got something going. David with some nice progress. Hannah with a nice save. Ken is very close. David working on his puzzle again. It's now David in the lead. <br/>No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. <br/>Jeff: Ken out of nowhere. Ken thinks he has it. Ken is wrong. Keep going. What is wrong? We've been playing with this logo all season. Ken now making a change. That opens the door for David and Jay. <br/>Ken, I’m going to tell you when your ball is dropping. You have to come back. <br/>Jeff: Everybody trying to catch Ken. David drops. <br/>Keep working. <br/>Jeff: Ken is still wrong. Ken going to try to change it. <br/>Ken, come back, Ken, come back, Ken, come back. <br/>Jeff: Nice save by Ken. <br/>Really, Adam? <br/>Here we go, here we go, here we go. <br/>Jeff: Does he have it this time? <br/>Come on. Yes! Ken wins individual immunity, same from the vote. He will make it to the final six. <br/>That was fun by that was crazy. <br/>That was fun by that was crazy. <br/>Jeff: Ken, come on over. <br/>Good job, Ken. <br/>Nice job, Ken. <br/>Apparently when you haven't eaten for 35 days, you can't  spell. <br/>Jeff: You got it right the second time. Ken safe from the vote. You will make it to the final six, live to see day 36. As for the rest of you, after 35 very tough days in this game,  it will come to an end for one of you, tribal council tonight, somebody going  home, it won't be you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp, see you tonight at tribal. Congrats. <br/>Jay is one of the strongest contenders in this game. It's definitely a struggle to sit there and watch someone who is  a younger version of myself. So I feel good wearing the idol around my neck as opposed to Jay. <br/>Great job, Ken. <br/>Nice job, Ken. <br/>Unbelievable. <br/>Good work, buddy. <br/>I thought you weren't a  puzzle guy. <br/>Simples puzzle like, that yes, slide puzzles and all  those, definitely not. <br/>My biggest fear going into the challenge was that Jay or  dave would win immunity. Of course, I would have preferred to win myself, but if I couldn't  win, I’m glad it was Ken. <br/>I'll get some firewood. <br/>Adam helped him. He didn't win that thing. <br/>Dude, I didn't want dave to win. He was right behind us. Yeah, I wanted to do everything I could to help Ken, because the  most important thing about the challenge is Jay did not win and dave did not  win. <br/>I swear to God, you guys,  I’m voting dave tonight. If you want to take me out later, but let me stay over these  two, please, God. My plan tonight is that in the case Jay does play his idol, dave  would go home. <br/>I want Jay to go home  tonight, but the safest thing to do... I don't feel great about the state of  my game at all, especially since Jay will be afraid that we're throwing votes  his way, and if he does have an idol and he does play it, I automatically go  home. <br/>Can we just tell you our plan? <br/>Okay. Tell me your plan. <br/>So ostensibly we are a voting bloc of four, you, me, Ken, Adam. <br/>That's true. <br/>So three votes Bret, one vote to Jay and Sunday, Bret and Jay  throw three votes at me. Jay will, if he has an idol will may it. He'll be safe. Then there's a tie between Bret and myself, and there will be a  revote, and then we flip all the votes to a Bret vote and Bret goes home. <br/>So we're trying to get Bret out. Why not Sunday, and here's why: Sunday at this point is such an  enticing goat. The longer she's in the game, the scarier I feel that someone  like Adam, who is playing really hard will flip on one of us to try to go  with Sunday. <br/>Okay. Can you get behind this then in. <br/>Okay. <br/>All right. Let's go. <br/>It is important at some point to split up Bret and Sunday. Sunday's extremely dangerous because she's sort of made herself  into a tempting goat, and people could want to sit next to her. And I’m very scared that someone who works less hard will get a  spot that I've worked really hard for. <br/>Let's talk about tonight. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jay is two immunity wins away from winning this game. <br/>Yeah. <br/>All I know is that I need to vote for Jay tonight. <br/>He's going to play his idol. <br/>And if he does, who are the other three? <br/>Dave. <br/>I definitely want to be  walking back here after tribal council with David, who has been my closest  ally, my closest friend, but Adam is afraid of David, doesn't want to play  against David. <br/>We need to vote for Jay. We need to get rid of his idols. <br/>I had a look conversation  with Ken and Hannah, and throughout the entire conversation, I knew what I wanted  to do. We have to put enough votes on Jay that if he doesn't play his  idol he goes home, and we have to put enough votes on dave that if he does  play his idol, dave goes home. <br/>The only way around it is this, four of us vote for Sunday,  but that risks Jay moving forward with an idol in his pocket. <br/>And if Jay were to win again, we'd be in big trouble. If we vote for Sunday, it would leave both Jay and dave in the  game, and they're two strong strategic players, so we have to make sure that  one of them goes home. <br/>These are the two biggest threats. If Jay goes home tonight, that's huge. He could win every immunity going. <br/>There are so many moving parts to tonight's vote, and the  worse thing we can have is tomorrow morning Jay is still in this game with an  idol in his pocket. <br/>You're the best player out here. <br/>I need you. <br/>Adam telling me, I know you have the idol, I’m going to  force you to play it, but Adam always lies to me, so in all honesty, my name  my night even come up tonight, and if I feel like not playing the idol, then  I might just do it. <br/>I’m forcing your hand. <br/>Yes, you are. <br/>Adam, just get me there, man. Please. <br/>I know. I know it means a lot to you. It means a lot to me, too. I'm in the same boat. <br/>That's why. I can't waste my opportunity. <br/>Can I tell you something I haven't told anyone this  season? <br/>What? <br/>My mom has stage four lung cancer. And she's already been through three treatments and I found out  when my brother came they aren't working. I'm doing this for her. She wants to watch me get to the end. That's why I can't waste this opportunity. My mom's going to die, bro. I love my mom just like he durkz and it's crazy because, like,  my mom had a brain aneurysm, me and Adam are both out here for our families  for our moms. He's not a weasel in my book anymore. He's a warrior. <br/>I think I might vote for Sunday. <br/>Oh, I hate you. <br/>Okay. Here's why. Even if Jay gets through, if Sunday goes home and leaves just  us, we have a more loyal four. <br/>I don't want to do that. <br/>Why not? <br/>Because I think one of the two of them have to go home  tonight. <br/>Why? <br/>Because they're huge threats in this game. <br/>Adam's reluctance to vote out Sunday is my reluctance,  too, because it leaves a visible threat in the game, which is David. The problem is if Jay plays his idol and David goes home, I lose  David, who I fricKen love, so I don't know if right choice, but the kind of  person that makes a decision and convinces other people of that decision is  the kind of person that wins "Survivor."  Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Michelle, Taylor, Chris, Jessica, Zeke, and will voted out at the  last tribal council. So, David, right now in the game, do friendships and alliances  really matter, or is it everybody for themselves and all bets are off? <br/>I actually think you have  to lean on friendships and bonds, even more than at the beginning or middle  of the game. I think they're incredibly important. <br/>Jeff: Jay, do you agree with that? Do bonds have currency? <br/>Yes, you are relying on alliances, which, you know, I don't  see any of mine sitting here anymore, but...  Jeff: Jay, is that where you feel pressure? You're clearly a threat and tonight you don't have the  protection of a necklace. <br/>Honestly, Jeff, a challenge threat is a big deal, but if  you have is a challenge threat with an alliance, what's wiger, the guy who is  alone or the guy who has friends that have his back? <br/>Jeff: Bret, what is Jay saying? <br/>Jay's saying he wishes he had that necklace around his  neck. <br/>Damn right. <br/>Because he's very scared tonight. <br/>Jeff: David, Jay is saying, I’m just one guy, but that all  depends on perspective. <br/>Yeah, you know, another term you could use would be a free  agent, and so if there are people looking to make a move, you can exploit  someone like a free agent. <br/>Jeff: You've taken a lot of heat, David. <br/>I have. <br/>Jeff: For several tribals people have said you're a  legitimate threat to win this game and we have to take you out, and yet here  you still sit. <br/>Yes. Yes, I do. I don't know that that will be true after tonight. But, yes, I've relied heavily on friendships and alliances to  still be sitting here. <br/>Jeff: Adam, you seem to have a reaction to that. Is David right or wrong in. <br/>Yeah, dave and the majority every vote has impressed  people with his work around camp, with his transformation, and that's what  juries love to root for. <br/>Jeff: Hannah, we keep coming back to this whole conundrum,  who to get rid of, who to take, based on what we think the jury will think. <br/>Yeah, a lot of discussion has been around who are the  threats to win at the end. Because I think every single pen here has already written their  final speech. And that's been a main point of discussion for all of us. <br/>Jeff: Sunday, what do you think is thought of you right  now? Are you somebody that they should take to the end or are you a  threat to get rid of tonight? <br/>Obviously I’m not a physical threat, so I think I’m a  person that people are thinking, oh, I'll just take her to the end. <br/>Jeff: Meaning you can't get any votes? <br/>I think I can get votes,  but I think there are people that think that I can't get votes, so I think I’m  a little underestimated. <br/>Jeff: Adam, if the perception of Sunday is true, it works  to Sunday's advantage. Suddenly it's like, maybe you should take me to the end and  maybe I can still beat you even though you clearly have no confidence in me. <br/>The reality is everyone in this group right now has been  playing their own game. It's just matter of what is the perception of the jury, and  that's what you have to take into account when deciding who you want to sit  next to at the end. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Sunday, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. <br/>All right. I'd rather be safe than sorry, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Jay will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote, Jay. Does not count. David. One vote David. David. Two votes David. Sunday. Two votes David, one vote Sunday. Sunday. Two votes David, two votes Sunday. Sunday. That's three votes Sunday, two votes David, one vote left. <br/>I knew it. I didn't have to use it. <br/>Jeff: 14th person voted out and the seventh member of our  jury, Sunday, you need to bring me your torch. Sunday, the tribe has spoKen. <br/>Good luck, guys. Have fun. <br/>Thanks, Sunday. <br/>Take care. <br/>Jeff: Well, 35 days ago we began this season millennials  versus gen x. So it is only fitting that there are three millennials, three  gen x as we begin the battle to the finish. Grab your torch, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor," six are left, and  the game is still up in the air. <br/>If I have to do dirty tricks like, this then so be it. <br/>An idol can screw everything up. <br/>I have the legacy  advantage. What do you have in store for me? <br/>Who will outlast all if others? <br/>Jeff: Every person here is a legitimate threat to win this  game and claim the title of sole Survivor. Join us for the two-hour season finale  Having to go home this close to the finish is gut  wrenching because you can see the finish line. I know my family will be beyond proud. I slept in the dirt for 30 days. I've done challenges and jumped off things I never would have  done. I'm leaving feeling so proud of myself and I have zero regrets  about it.
