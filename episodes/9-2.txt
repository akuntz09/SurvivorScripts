<br/> <br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor8 castaways were  marooned on the island nation of Vanuatu, and during a native ceremony, the  men and women were divided into opposing tribes.  <br/>It's perfect. I can outsmart eight men a hell of a lot  quicker than I can outsmart eight women.  <br/>Probst: The pressure was on when the men were given a  chance to get a traditional spirit stone for luck. You have to get it from  the top of that pole. If you fail, the women get it. Brady got the stone for  the men.  <br/>I think the boys got a lot more out of that ceremony than  we did. We're out for blood now.  <br/>Probst: On the hike to find their camp, conflict came  quick to the Yasur tribe when Scout held back the others.  <br/>I just wanted to hunker down till daylight.  <br/>Like, I think sleeping right here is, like, the stupidest  thing we could possibly do.  <br/>Probst: And for Lopevi, it was Rory who stirred the  pot.  <br/>We really need to come up with some sort of game plan.  Nine of us walking in a group like a bunch of ladies ain't helping.  <br/>Probst: Both tribes found their camps.  <br/>We got the flag! [cheering]  <br/>Probst: And the next morning at Yasur, there was more  division.  <br/>Twila has been working on the shelter constantly.  <br/>We had too much chatting and not enough moving.  <br/>I call these sorority girls "bowheads." They all  like to hang together. They're like cattle.  <br/>I'm really not a negative person, like...  <br/>Eliza talks non-stop. She's probably at the top of my list  just to get her mouth out of my face.  <br/>Probst: At the first challenge, the men and women competed  for immunity as well as flint to make fire. Lopevi had the lead, until Chris  failed to make it across the balance beam. The women win the war and  immunity! Back at camp, the younger guys Back at camp, the younger guys  wanted Chris out. wanted Chris out.  <br/>Probst: But Chris and Lea had their own plan.  <br/>The only way we're going to get a million dollars-- one of  us-- is if we get rid of the young people.  <br/>I'll talk to Chad. I'll take care of it.  <br/>Probst: Lea and Chris's plan worked. Perceived as a  physical threat by the older men, Brook was voted out of the tribe. 17 are  left. Who will be voted out tonight?

The standing joke this  morning was, "Well, how was your sleep this morning?" My answer  was, "I slept like a baby. Woke up every three or four minutes and  cried." It's not good. We need fire for heat and just for food, 'cause  we're getting so drained. I want to eat something cooked so bad.  <br/>Look, I'll eat it.  <br/>Look, I'll eat it. I mean, it's protein. I mean, it's  protein.  <br/>It's been pretty tough... a lot tougher than I thought it  would be. Are we prepared for fire if it does actually take off? Have we got  everything we need to keep it going? Nothing positive's really happened for  us. We need something to boost our morale.  <br/>All right, dawg.  <br/>This could change everything.  <br/>We're ready. This is it. It smells good already.  <br/>Oh, yeah.  <br/>Keep going.  <br/>Good smoke.  <br/>Ready?  <br/>It's getting darker.  <br/>Go, go, go!  <br/>Come on, J.P., go, dude, go. Go, dude. Come on, dude, come  on. More heat, the more fire, dude. Go, dude, go, dude. Keep it going,  J.P.  <br/>It's hot. Oh, yeah, it is.  <br/>Real light, real light and slow. Steady, steady, steady.  Real light and slow.  <br/>We got it. Get it in there.  <br/>It's lit. It's lit. It's lit. It is lit.  <br/>It's burning my hand underneath. underneath.  <br/>Come here, Sarge, quick!  <br/>Come here, Sarge, quick! Nobody blow. Just let Chris,  okay?  <br/>Cover it up. Make it more.  <br/>Ow! Man, that thing burnt my hand.  <br/>It's going to take off.  <br/>Pay tribute. Pay tribute.  <br/>It's going to start.  <br/>Respect the island. Respect the island.  <br/>That's it, Chris.  <br/>Whoever gets to be around.  <br/>It's smoking!  <br/>Get away from it with that.  <br/>Whoo!  <br/>It's raining. It just can't rain.  <br/>We need something drier. We need...  <br/>It's too hot. [shouts]  <br/>Cover it up.  <br/>Keep it hot. Keep it hot. Keep it hot.  <br/>Come on, come on, catch!  <br/>Come on, come on, catch!  <br/>Nothing, dude.  <br/>You know, we're working ourselves to death, and, uh...  that was a real downer. We know exactly that if we don't get water soon,  we're going to be hurting. These girls are going to kick These girls are  going to kick our tail. our tail.  <br/>We don't mind spotting you.  <br/>Go ahead. We got you.  <br/>Now, go up first.  <br/>Now step on my shoulder.  <br/>Got it?  <br/>Got it.  <br/>All right, yeah, you can get it?  <br/>Get her the machete!  <br/>Wait, I can't do it. You got to do it together.  <br/>Keep her on your shoulder.  <br/>One, two, three, up.  <br/>One, two, three, up.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah. Here it comes. Oh, geez, the machete.  <br/>Please don't drop the machete, dude.  <br/>Lift me up a little bit higher.  <br/>You better hurry up.  <br/>Yeah, honey, I-I can't...  <br/>I can't do much more of this.  <br/>Get it!  <br/>You're on my hand.  <br/>Get it!  <br/>Wait! [grunts] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm going to  grab it.  <br/>Yes!  <br/>Yay!  <br/>Good job, mama.  <br/>I'm going to tell you what. This better be good for  dinner.  <br/>That better not be poisonous. Day four. It's going rough.  It's just getting unreal-- the circumstances and our living conditions. And  it's about 1,000 times harder than I thought this was going to be. [thunder  rumbling] Gosh, can we get a break here, man?  <br/>It's just... horrendous. The beach is uncomfortable. The  water's uncomfortable. It's freezing at night. Everything is damp. Like, you  always feel wet and cold. I mean, it's beautiful, like, looking at it, but,  like, to live here, it's just so miserable. I think someone was saying last  night that being here is like being in prison, because we do not have nearly  enough food, and then we have these unripe, disgusting plantains that when  you cook 'em just taste like you cook 'em just taste like burnt... mush.  burnt... mush.  <br/>How's the coconut cooked?  <br/>Uh-oh.  <br/>What is that, a maggot?  <br/>Yep.  <br/>Here, hand it over.  <br/>Oh, my God, there are maggots in that.  <br/>There are a bunch of 'em in there.  <br/>Oh, my God, I see them.  <br/>Where?  <br/>They're all over.  <br/>It can't be a maggot, because it's... it's-it's been  boiled.  <br/>Are those maggots, Scout?  <br/>Those are definitely maggots.  <br/>Eh, I'm eating it anyway. Everything was boiled.  <br/>Boy, look at all that protein in there.  <br/>Yeah, eat 'em up, mm. Gosh, give 'em to me. Mm...  <br/>Just not eating and not sleeping at night, and the... the  maggots... And it's just all sinking in. And it's just all sinking in.  It's... it's rough. It's... it's rough. Nothing's wrong. It's just... it's  just coming out of me.  <br/>You've been crying.  <br/>[sighs] But nothing's wrong. I'm just... it's just coming  out of me. [sighs] Like, I'm having fun. I'm not... I'm not complaining at  all. I'm so happy to be here. I just am hungry and tired.  <br/>Eliza, do you know why somebody put the...?  <br/>Thank you. You are so nice to me. [sighs]  <br/>I don't know. These young ones-- I don't know if they  thought this was a joke. I don't know what they was thinking. If it comes  down to eating maggots, I'm going to eat maggots. To me, if there was, they  were cooked. They're good. Protein. Eat 'em. Shut up. Sorority girls, like...  like Scout calls 'em-- they're not mature enough. They're not physically  strong enough. They just... they just wear me out. They just don't understand  the game, I guess. If they want to be pampered, they need to go back to the  Holiday Inn.  <br/>Travis, can I ask you something personal?  <br/>Yeah, go ahead.  <br/>Before Tribal Council, did my name come up?  <br/>This past one?  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>Yes, it did.  <br/>Tribal Council last night was very intense, and it was an  eye-opener. As of right now, it's myself, John and Brady. We're kind of like  the physical, young, vibrant guys in the tribe. Then you have the older  crowd: the Sarge, Chad, Rory, Travis and Chris. Those are five guys. Right  now, it's five against three. Those aren't good odds.  <br/>I'll shoot you straight. Let's stop and talk, all  right?  <br/>Let's stop and talk, man.  <br/>You're too big of a threat.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>I like you.  <br/>Great.  <br/>I think... I think...  <br/>Wait, a threat to the group or a threat to you?  <br/>When this thing... when this thing goes, it's your  personality, your great looks. That's a threat. When I make my decision, I've  got four children at home and a wife. And that's what I base my decisions on.  You are so frickin' dangerous, man.  <br/>So if I had kids, would that... would that alter your  decision? Is that what you're telling me?  <br/>No, I'm saying, if you had kids, you'd be playing the game  and understand...  <br/>What, like-like you? I'd be playing the game like you if I  had kids?  <br/>I've known you for what now, five days?  <br/>Five days. Five days.  <br/>I've got a family at home I've known a long time.  <br/>Five days. Who else is a threat, T.?  <br/>Anybody playing the game.  <br/>Yeah?  <br/>Anybody that's in this game. There were 17 threats when we  started this game. 17 threats. 17 threats. Only one person wins. Only one  person wins.  <br/>Probst: Yasur coming in nine strong. Hey, guys. Yasur  getting your first look at the new Lopevi Tribe.  <br/>Who's gone?  <br/>Probst: Brook-- voted out, first Tribal Council. Ready to  get to today's challenge?  <br/>Yes, sir.  <br/>Probst: Okay, it's for reward. Here's how it works: Each  tribe member, numbered one through eight, will line up on a beam. Moving one  tribe member at a time, in order, you move down the beam, squeezing past the  other tribe members. If you fall off, go back to the start. Keep trying until  you get it right. You cannot touch more than one person at any time. If you  do, go back to the start, try again. First tribe to get all eight to the  finish platform wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Hopefully, this will help... [excited chattering]  ...your night sleeping a little better. [exclaiming] Okay, you have one hammock,  two pillows, three nice heavy, heavy blankets. In addition, Lopevi, from here  on out, you'll also be playing for your flint. Worth playing for?  <br/>Yes, sir.  <br/>Probst: Yasur, because you have one extra tribe member,  you're sitting somebody out. You cannot sit out the same person in  back-to-back challenges. Who is sitting out, Yasur?  <br/>Scout.  <br/>Scout.  <br/>Probst: Scout's going to sit this one out. All right, take  your spots on the beam-- wait for my go. Here we go, guys. For reward in the  form of blankets and pillows and for the men, the chance for fire. Survivors,  ready and begin. You can only touch one person at a time. Bye-bye. Back to  the start. Resist the temptation to touch two people. That's it. Eliza, back  to the beginning. Eliza, back to the beginning. Brady making his way past  one. Brady making his way past one. Eliza and Lisa struggling. Nice and close.  Brady starting to figure it out. Moving past Chad. Brady and Chad doing well.  Eliza moving past Dolly. Eliza moving past Dolly. Don't touch two people.  Don't touch two people. Brady moving past Sarge. As you get room, spread out  a little more. Eliza is down.  <br/>Yes! Go, go, go! Come on, Yasur!  <br/>Probst: Bubba and Brady doing a little waltz. a little  waltz. Not sure Bubba likes this. Not sure Bubba likes this.  <br/>It's okay. Come on, come on.  <br/>Probst: Julie's in. Brady only one spot away.  <br/>Good job.  <br/>Probst: And he's there. All the way down.  <br/>Julie, come on. [indistinct chatter]  <br/>Probst: J.K. moving past J.P. Holding that hug just a  little long. J.K. and J.P. still struggling. Julie's finished. The women have  two across. The men still at one. John talking through it with Sarge.  <br/>You have to trust each other. If you lean back, he'll hold  you. Trust him. Trust him.  <br/>Way to go, way to go!  <br/>Way to go, way to go!  <br/>Probst: John goes in.  <br/>Nice, nice, nice.  <br/>Probst: Taking Twila a long time.  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: Twila's across. That's four for the women. And the  men still at one.  <br/>We want them damn blankets. I'm freezing my butt  off.  <br/>John, you're going with them, buddy.  <br/>Probst: Brady trying to help. ...back, John! Chad, you've  got to trust... you've got to trust that he'll hold you, buddy. You have to  lean back a little farther.  <br/>Probst: Ooh.  <br/>Way to go, Twila. You're looking good.  <br/>Probst: No, Ami. Back to the start. You touched two people  at one time. time.  <br/>Just jump and go.  <br/>Just jump and go.  <br/>Probst: John's past Chad, moving on to Sarge.  <br/>Take your time, Ami. [indistinct chatter]  <br/>Probst: That's the way, John. Moving past Bubba. John back  in. Ami across. Five women, one man. Leann gets past Dolly easily. Pillows,  blankets, hammock at stake for the women. Women down to the last two.  <br/>Go, go, go.  <br/>Come on!  <br/>Probst: Dolly steps down. Mia moonwalks over to the side.  [woman cheering] Yasur wins their second challenge in a row! challenge in a  row! [cheering loudly] [cheering loudly] [cheering loudly] [women whooping]  [women whooping] All right, well, guys, once again balance beam proves tough.  You were playing for flint in addition. That will stay with me. You'll get a  chance at the next challenge. Guys, head on out, back to camp. Same way you  came. Women, this is yours. Women, this is yours. [cheering] [cheering]  <br/>Could you imagine Sarge getting past Travis? It's  impossible.  <br/>And Twila's little dance. [humming] What the hell... what  is that?  <br/>That wasn't Twila.  <br/>Well, whatever her name is.  <br/>Mia.  <br/>It was a game. I mean, we lost.  <br/>At least show some class, man.  <br/>[stammers]  <br/>We probably would've done...  <br/>I understand that they're proud about it, Sarge.  <br/>But we would've done the same thing.  <br/>No, I don't think that we would've done the same thing. I  don't think that we would've intentionally shoved somebody's nose into it.  You know, that was nonsense. That was classless. Show some class! They're  grown women. I understand it's a competition, but if she was a man, would you  have taken that, Sarge? No.  <br/>Take what? I mean, we lost. I mean, I lose humble because  it's a competition.  <br/>I'm humbled because of that, too, but I don't need a  dance. dance.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Okay. I have been contemplating over this one person that  is striking me wrong as rain.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Same person.  <br/>And I'm like, man, I just... I'm... we're in a game. And  to sit there and defame someone because of a game, you know, how you going to  get upset? I mean, he's all, "Well, they shouldn't have danced."  But to sit there and walk around here and grumble for hours over something...  It's just, I don't know, it... It's just, I don't know, it... strikes me  funny. strikes me funny.  <br/>I think we're going to have a sunny day.  <br/>Good morning. ♪ Good morning to you Good morning to you. ♪  [humming]  <br/>I am just happy that we have water and we had blankets  last night, and the guys are suffering big time. And I wouldn't want to be in  their shoes because I know what it was like the first couple days and that  sucks, big time. [clucking]  <br/>Don't move, don't move.  <br/>You guys, I have never killed anything.  <br/>My shoes aren't... Wait, don't move, don't move. He's  going to go that way. I want him to come this way. You can't run after it  because the thing will fly. the thing will fly. [clucking continues]  [clucking continues] Just don't scare him away the other way.  <br/>Chicken soup sure sounded good.  <br/>Chicken soup?  <br/>Chicken soup? Man, the whole chicken. Man, the whole  chicken. Man, the whole chicken. [clucking] [clucking]  <br/>Just swing down and thump him. [clucking]  <br/>I'll tell you what. I'll kill that rooster if I find it.  find it. [clucking] [clucking]  <br/>Oh, I see him. Oh, my God, he's laying an egg.  <br/>"She." I hate to be mean but...  <br/>What are you going to do? [clucking]  <br/>I could go right through here.  <br/>I say just stab her.  <br/>It will be gross.  <br/>Solid stab.  <br/>Just do it. Just do it.  <br/>Oh, God, I hate to do this.  <br/>Take a deep breath, say you're sorry, thank you, God, for  this gift.  <br/>Yeah, really.  <br/>Thank God for this gift. But I'm sorry, chicken, 'cause I  can't stand to hurt any animal. God. [clucking] Ooh, get her, get her! Get  her, get her! Grab her, grab her! Grab her! Aah!  <br/>Well, is there an egg?  <br/>There's several eggs.  <br/>There's several eggs!  <br/>Yeah. We almost had us a chicken. I got five eggs.  <br/>Onesy... twosey...  <br/>Oh, this is a blessing,  <br/>Oh, this is a blessing, y'all. y'all. [whooping]  [gasping]  <br/>Careful.  <br/>Whoa, no. No, no, no.  <br/>What happened?  <br/>Oh, no, oh, no.  <br/>The good news about being a tribe of all women is that we  care about each other, we want each other to succeed. We haven't had to start  voting people off yet. And I think we can win the next challenge. But I  definitely see groups forming. The two groups that were formed I think are  like the older generation and then the younger generation. That diversity in  age has really separated everybody.  <br/>Can you get it?  <br/>I think so. It's heavy, but I got it.  <br/>The younger group would be Mia, Julie, Dolly, Eliza and  Lisa, which I think she likes being in the younger group. And the older group  has been more like Scout and Twila, and I think Leann's more in the older  group.  <br/>I just, every time I hear 35 I think, half of 70. I'm  almost 70. [laughing]  <br/>I think I gravitate more towards the older group just  because they're really willing to work. But this is a game of non-trust. I  view the first day coming in, do not trust anyone. Don't trust anybody.  <br/>Well, it's going to come down to a point not where who  likes who but who is threatened by who. Do you know I mean?  <br/>Yeah, but that's why I say if we can get down to five  women, then the strategy's over.  <br/>And the girls go.  <br/>Yeah, and then we're safe.  <br/>Twila is just wanting to know that she is part of a  majority group. That she's, uh, she's not on the chopping block. At first, we  were all talking about you.  <br/>I know.  <br/>And-and then, uh... I think Twila knew that the five  younger girls-- and we had said that if we had gone to Tribal Council the  first, uh, challenge that we would have voted for her. And then now, you  know, we cannot vote for Twila. She's busting her ass. We absolutely have to  have her here. The expendable person really is Eliza.  <br/>She drives me nuts.  <br/>She's driving everybody... if she's driving Scout nuts, I  mean...  <br/>If it comes down to alliance-wise and stuff, it's Ami and  me and Scout and Leann. The only one we have to worry about is, uh, Dolly.  Dolly's going to be the... She's the pivot person in the middle. I think  she's in, but you never know.  <br/>Yeah, let them do their own thing. If we got five voting  for Eliza, then we're in the clear.  <br/>That's it.  <br/>I'm-I'm with you.  <br/>I'm-I'm with you. Eliza. Eliza.  <br/>Mail for you, buddy. "So far, it seems the spirits  haven't responded to the stone. "Depend upon your tribe mates. You can't  do this on your own. "When you put it all together, it takes agility,  skill and trust. Tonight, the dreams of victory for one will turn to dust."  <br/>Tree mail!  <br/>Tree mail! The spirit stone, is, of course, the, uh, idol  that we won on our first welcome to the island, and it's supposed to bring  good luck to the bearer, but quite frankly, it has not worked for us. We  haven't won immunity yet.  <br/>We need some sort of victory around here.  <br/>We'll get one. We all got to work together. We know  that.  <br/>The stone is important for us. It started off, uh, as a  stone at the ceremony. We just brought it with us to set up our camp, but  then we started sort of neglecting it, and things weren't going our way, so,  um, we started to give way, so, um, we started to give it a bit more respect.  it a bit more respect.  <br/>Remember the rain when  <br/>Remember the rain when you took it down? you took it  down?  <br/>I don't know if it's just sick timing, but the day has  been clear all day, and then all of a sudden, they put the spirit stone back  on the pole, and it starts raining again. There's magic on Vanuatu. That's...  There's magic on this That's... There's magic on this island. island.  <br/>Probst: Yasur, Lopevi, come  <br/>Probst: Yasur, Lopevi, come on in! on in! All right. Let's  get to today's challenge. I will take back immunity. I know you hate to see  it go.  <br/>We'll get it back.  <br/>Probst: Immunity back up for grabs. Today's challenge is  going to test communication and the ability to work together. Scattered out  in the field and in the water are 12 pairs of puzzle pieces. You're going to  designate one tribe member to be your set of eyes. The other tribe members  will be blindfolded and tied together in three groups. You'll collect the  pairs of puzzle pieces one pair at a time. Bring 'em back, drop 'em on your  mat. Once you have all the pieces collected, take off your blindfold, start  assembling three puzzles in order from bottom to top. First tribe to complete  all three puzzle wins immunity. And for Lopevi...  <br/>Fire!  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Fire!  <br/>Probst: You're still playing for that flint. Okay. Yasur,  you have one extra member. You're sitting somebody out. Who's it going to  be?  <br/>Dolly.  <br/>Probst: Dolly's going to sit sit out.  <br/>I'll sit out.  <br/>Probst: Who's going to be your set of eyes?  <br/>Scout.  <br/>Scout.  <br/>Probst: Scout's going to be the eyes-- Lopevi?  <br/>Sarge.  <br/>Probst: Sarge is going to be the eyes. All right, let's  get you All right, let's get you blindfold, and we'll get going. blindfold,  and we'll get going. Here we go, guys, for immunity, and Lopevi, for flint.  Survivors ready?

[cheering]  [cheering]  <br/>Hey, there's no crying on Survivor.  <br/>No crying in Survivor.  <br/>No, there's not.  <br/>Honey, we play 'em well, and we play 'em tight...  <br/>Everything's going to be  <br/>Everything's going to be fine. fine.  <br/>Let's go...  <br/>We've got a coconut down here ready to go.  <br/>I never expected to like everyone so much.  <br/>Really?  <br/>Really?  <br/>It's just awful.  <br/>It's just awful.  <br/>Really?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>So, are you voting with them now?  <br/>I'm not voting with anyone at this point. I'm just going  to... for this time, I'm voting, like, for her, because I don't know who else  to vote for. The "T" works pretty hard right now. right now.  <br/>Right.  <br/>Right.  <br/>Originally, we had Dolly secure, but I think, being as  sweet as Dolly is, you know, she, uh, you know, kind of switched back and  felt guilty. The only good thing about... Well, not the only good thing about  Eliza, but a great thing about Eliza is the fact that you tell her to do  this, and she'll do it. I don't think she's looking out for her best  interests. I think she's looking out for everybody's interests, and it's just  not possible in this game.  <br/>Okay, so if we keep to our first five, then we go with  Twila then, tonight, if we go...  <br/>Do you feel comfortable with that, or do you want to keep  Leann, or do you want to get...? I mean, Leann's just kind of like...  <br/>DOLLY: Yeah, Leann's...  <br/>I love Leann. I love everybody, okay, but, like, is she less  of a...? You know, 'cause Twila does work so hard.  <br/>Yeah. Maybe Leann. Yeah, my head is completely spinning,  and I'm, uh, I'm afraid, um, at this point, because I don't want to... I  don't want to make the wrong choice. I'm definitely in the middle, and I hate  that, but I-I think I-I'm definitely more loyal to to my younger crowd, my  younger girls.  <br/>Right, right.  <br/>'Cause I'd have more fun out here, I think.  <br/>Do you want to say Twila or Leann? It's up to you.  <br/>Let's say Leann for the first one.  <br/>Okay. Leann.  <br/>All right. Okay. You know, it's... I'm already... I've got  myself in a jam. It's a cluster... cluster you-know-what.  <br/>How are we going to decide, like, now that we have to talk  about it. I'm down with talking about it. Like, I didn't really talk about it  before because I wasn't close yet, you know what I mean?  <br/>I think, uh, I think, uh, Julie and Mia and myself, and I  think Lisa also, are saying Leann for this first time.  <br/>Right.  <br/>It's so tough, you know.  <br/>It's so tough, you know.  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>I know I can vote for Leann or Eliza, either way.  <br/>That's my preferred vote is Eliza, because she's just so,  just...  <br/>Yeah. Yeah, she is irritating.  <br/>Just so irritating.  <br/>Yeah, but I have Mia and Julie saying Leann, and just get  it done and get it over with.  <br/>I wish I knew their criteria for that. Leann doesn't  complain. She's a strong competitor.  <br/>There's no rhyme or reason behind her, it's just...  <br/>Leann's a pretty good worker, isn't she, or is  she...?  <br/>I haven't even noticed. I don't even notice Leann. That's  the thing. For some reason, she's just not on my radar at all.  <br/>Dolly told me that she was definitely going to vote for  Leann. I nearly dropped my teeth. That just... That just... What? What?  <br/>So who are you voting for, Leann?  <br/>Who am I voting for?  <br/>Me.  <br/>I don't know. Is there, uh... [chuckles nervously] What's  going on? I don't know what's going on at all.  <br/>I don't agree with either one. I just think it's turned  into a popularity contest...  <br/>What's the other one?  <br/>...and I'm not into that.  <br/>What's the other one? Is it me?  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>Why me?  <br/>What Dolly said was, "We'll vote Leann off now and  save Eliza for later." And I guess it's just how the cookie crumbles,  but it's kind of turned into this Dolly, Julie and Mia are, like, running the  whole thing.  <br/>I don't like that at all. I-I don't like that at  all.  <br/>This is the most interesting thing. I swear, everyone just  running off... trying to scheme.  <br/>Never knowing what's really going on.  <br/>Dolly is playing both sides big time.  <br/>She is hard-core playing. And, I mean, maybe we should  just vote for her. Honest to God. Honest to God. As opposed to it being one  of the two of us.  <br/>You'd have to talk Scout into that.  <br/>Yeah, Scout and Twila would never go for it.  <br/>Yes, they would.  <br/>They would, too.  <br/>They would go for it?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>At least Eliza is down there, and they can't really be  talking...  <br/>Oh, yeah, true.  <br/>Do you have an alliance with somebody that you're not  telling us about?  <br/>I don't know what to base my vote on. I don't know whether  I should vote for Leann, stick with my original alliance, and, you know, hope  that they carry me through, or I should vote off the person who makes me  really nervous, who I don't completely trust. Out of all of those five girls  in that alliance that we have, I trust Dolly the least.  <br/>I got so much pressure on me from both sides, that I just  don't know what to do.  <br/>I know. All I want to know is that you're not writing my  name down.  <br/>No.  <br/>I think there is a possibility that she could vote me off.  That she would turn on me. I just don't want the other four girls in that  alliance to go blindsided. But then again, if I bring it up to them and I  tell them, look, I'm thinking of voting out Dolly, they're going to say, we  better just vote you out. So I don't know what the heck to So I don't know  what the heck to do. do.  <br/>Probst: Behind each of you guys is a torch. Go ahead and  grab a torch, approach a flame and get fire. This is part of the ritual at  Tribal Council because in this game, fire represents your life. When your  flame is gone, so are you. Back in its slot. Have a seat. Welcome to your  first Tribal Council. I know you guys don't want to be here. Before we get to  the vote, let's talk about today's challenge. Scout, did you feel anything as  you saw the lead getting further and further away?  <br/>Yeah, I definitely feel like I blew it. You know, I would  have loved to have done differently. But you can't wallow in that. You've got  to step forward and, you know, that's what we're doing.  <br/>Probst: Eliza, let's talk about workload. How did it fall  out?  <br/>Everyone has their on days and off day, I mean, except  for... except for Twila.  <br/>Probst: Was Twila the only one doing work or were there  people at the other end of the spectrum? Twila?  <br/>Oh, no, I had help. Leann, Scout, Ami, us four did a lot  of work. But the rest of them worked hard in their areas, too.  <br/>Probst: Leann, what's been the toughest for you?  <br/>Not sleeping. It's really uncomfortable, but it's much  better with the blankets for sure. I slept last night.  <br/>Probst: And what's the impact for you because you're tired  or hungry?  <br/>I get a little quiet. Especially in the mornings, I'm kind  of mm...  <br/>Probst: But in a social game, withdrawing can work against  you.  <br/>I'm very much aware of that. I get the feeling I'm going  home tonight.  <br/>Probst: Dolly, how are you getting along with  everybody?  <br/>I think I'm getting along almost too well with everyone  and it's kind of becoming a problem for me because I feel kind of like Dolly  in the middle. Four people want to vote one way, and four people want to vote  another way, and I'm kind of the deciding factor tonight.  <br/>Probst: Eliza, are you worried it could be you  tonight?  <br/>I'm definitely worried it could be me. I mean, you never  know if, you know, somebody tells you they're voting one way if they're  actually going to do it. You know, you just have to pray that people stick to  their word.  <br/>Probst: Okay, it is time to vote. vote. Eliza, you're up.  Eliza, you're up.  <br/>My vote is for Leann because Dolly's pretty much running  the show, but I do like running the show, but I do like her. her.  <br/>Leann, you seem like a great girl, just didn't have time to  get to know you. And, um, it's purely so the five "young'uns," as  you call us, can stick together and get through this. this. Sorry.  Sorry.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are  read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the  Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... First  vote... Leann. Leann. Leann. Two votes Leann. Leann. Three votes Leann.

Well, the  person who thought they were the swing vote is the person you just voted out  of your tribe, so the question is: Will tonight's vote bring you together as  a tribe or continue to separate you? Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
