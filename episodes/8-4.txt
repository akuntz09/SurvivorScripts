<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor:  Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: The tribes competed to build the best shelter, which  led Chapera to question Rob C's work ethic. <br/>Where have you been? <br/>I got lost in the jungle. <br/>ROB M.: it seems like he's on a never-ending coffee break. <br/>ROB C.: You want to get more rocks? <br/>ALICIA: Youwant to get more rocks. <br/>ROB C.: Okay. <br/>Jeff: At Saboga, Rupert and Jerri clashed over Rupert's  underground shelter design. <br/>JERRI: I don't feel digging into the ground is a good  idea. <br/>RUPERT: I know what I can do. I'm 40 years old. I've built houses for 20 years. <br/>Let's just... do it. <br/>Jeff: On judgment day, Rupert's stubbornness cost his  tribe. You would not want to live here? <br/>Oh, no. <br/>ETHAN: I don't think he likes it. <br/>Jeff: Chapera's shelter secured them a victory and a  bounty of comfort. <br/>ROB M.: Get that wine open, let's go. <br/>Jeff: At the celebration, Rob and Amber's alliance heated  up. <br/>AMBER: If you're going to kiss me, kiss me now because I'm  not kissing you with nasty breath later on. <br/>ROB M.: Whoa. <br/>Jeff: At Mogo Mogo, Jenna started to fade from the game. <br/>JENNA: I have a lot to lose being here, like my mom. She's had cancer for a long time and I'm just afraid that she  might pass away while I'm here. <br/>Jeff: When the tribes arrived at the immunity challenge,  Jenna made a tough decision. <br/>JENNA: Due to someone who's very ill at home right now, I  need to pull myself out of the game. <br/>Jeff: This is a big action, and it could have a big impact  on this game. With Jenna's departure, Mogo Mogo lost their first member. 15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION [  thunder crashing] [ thunder crashing]  TOM: We need a boat. We need a boat bad. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! <br/>We are in a little river. Rio PequeÃ±o. That's the name of the camp today. <br/>ALICIA: I knew that it was rainy season in Panama, but I  didn't realize that rainy season meant, like, torrential downpours that flood  your whole entire camp. <br/>SUE: Who would have ever thought? You can actually see it flowing through the studs of the house. <br/>AMBER: We have constructed a shelter that is pretty  unbelievable. We used everything possible that we got from our reward. We put the parachute as a wall, we have the tarp on top. <br/>ROB M.: The shelter held up pretty good. The water was a little bit excessive, though. It ended up coming up through the floor. We weren't really predicting for that to happen. However, I slept almost all night long, 'cause I was under the  blanket. I was warm, and I just slept the whole night. <br/>AMBER: You're so warm. <br/>TOM: Rob and Amber were laying on the thing kind of  getting a romantic mood. Maybe the rain was just an excuse to maybe snuggle a little  closer. <br/>ROB C.: Boston Rob and Amber are going to do it. I don't know when, but they're going to do it. They've got the mat, the pillows. Everything is in place, and I really wish those two the best of  luck. <br/>RUPERT: Our beach is of luck. <br/>RUPERT: Our beach is destroyed, that stupid shelter that I  built is destroyed. Digging into the sand is the dumbest idea I've ever had in my  life. And we paid dearly tonight for it. It's now underwater, and we are homeless. And I got to build us another shelter today, something today. <br/>JERRI: We've been shivering in the rain probably five or  six hours, if not more. It's a disaster. The rain just started pouring, and the whole shelter filled up  with water. The entire thing. The hole that Rupert thought was so brilliant to dig, filled up  with water. This never would have happened if they hadn't dug that hole. [sobbing]: It's not worth it. <br/>RUPERT: That storm was [sobbing]: It's not worth it. <br/>RUPERT: That storm was insanely hard. It was rough this morning, it was rough last night. <br/>ETHAN: Other than the time father passed away, I think  that was the worst night of my life. Hands down. It was horrible. Some of us thought people were going to come and rescue us. I'm like, "They're not going to rescue us. What are you, nuts?" I'm like, "This is  Survivor." It's our own fault this we built a crappy old shelter. <br/>JENNA L.: It's not raining at out there. Come on. You have to start warming up. I promise you it's warmer out here. I'm in a bathing suit. It's dripping and wet in here. <br/>JERRI: I don't have a clue what's going on at camp, other  than disassembling our old shelter. I don't know where they plan on moving it, or what they plan on  doing with it. As far as I'm concerned, I couldn't give a rat's ass at this  point. I don't even care. <br/>RUPERT: You want any? <br/>JENNA L.: Drink some. Come on. It's good for you. <br/>RUPERT: It is good for you. If Jerri warms up and feels better and soaks a little of  daylight in her, she'll be fine, too. But the plan today is, we got to make shelter, we got to make  fire, and we got to get it together now. <br/>SHII ANN: Look how much it rained. <br/>COLBY: I'm glad we set that out. <br/>KATHY: Oh, good. <br/>LEX: Good, good, good. <br/>SHII ANN: Last night was one of those moments when you  realize Mother Nature can be one forceful bitch. <br/>KATHY: We'll have to come up with a really good lean-to  and a way to keep an ember, you know? <br/>COLBY: Yeah. <br/>KATHY: You know, you think you're a veteran at this game  and living in the environment after doing a Survivor,but, uh, you know, we  should have known better, and we do now. When we woke up, the fire was gone, but we got our flint out,  and we made some, uh, fluff out of the twine that came in our Home Depot box. <br/>LEX: Are you going to make a wig? [ Kathy laughs] It looks like your hair. <br/>KATHY: Take me to the Casbah. <br/>LEX: Don't blow. <br/>RICHARD: We're getting close to when I got... Oh, we're  not close, but almost, to the time I could head out and try and get  something. <br/>COLBY: Hey, Hatch? <br/>RICHARD: Yeah? <br/>COLBY: What have you got? <br/>RICHARD: Today was a nice fishing day. To come back today with three, you know, meat-chunked moray  eels. <br/>Yeah! <br/>KATHY: Yeah! [ applause]  And what's that one in the middle, Hatch? <br/>That your bait? <br/>KATHY: That's your bait box. <br/>Whoo! <br/>LEX: After we cooked and cleaned these eels, there must  have been at least five or six pounds of meat. It tastes really good. <br/>KATHY: It's good. <br/>LEX: It's grilled fish, but really good. <br/>KATHY: That's good. <br/>RICHARD: I don't know what it is, but, boy, I bring a fish  in, they're blown away by my feeding them. I mean, I could sit around and do absolutely nothing, and  they're just thrilled that I'm there to provide 'em fish. It's great. <br/>Want more of that? <br/>RICHARD: That's all yours, baby. <br/>LEX: I think Richard does a phenomenal job of providing us  with food. That said, one of the reasons I'm looking so forward to getting  the third key to that rice box is that once we have rice, we won't need to  rely so heavily on Richard for food. <br/>COLBY: What is that? <br/>ETHAN: "In this game of give and take..."  ROB C.: "Give too much, big mistake."  COLBY: "Take it all from friend and foe, and you'll  be clean from head to toe."  LEX: It's a puzzle of some sort. <br/>COLBY: Yeah. <br/>ETHAN: Exciting stuff. <br/>ROB C.: I've played this game before. <br/>Shii Ann, this may be your game to win. <br/>COLBY: "In this game of give and take, give too much,  big mistake."  RUPERT: "Take it all from friend and foe, and you'll  be clean from head to toe."  COLBY: I wonder if this box symbolizes anything. <br/>We'll know when we get there. Sounds like fun. <br/>ALICIA: Wow! <br/>ROB C.: "We've played this game with kisses and hugs. Now it's time to see if you can eat bugs."  ALICIA: Oh! <br/>ROB C.: No, I'm just kidding. <br/>SUE: I could eat this whole pot! Girl, I'd eat whatever they put in front of my face. <br/>ROB C.: Sue, I was kidding. I was kidding about that. <br/>SUE: Huh? <br/>It was a joke. <br/>ROB C.: Just relax. No sweat, this one. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. How's everybody doing? <br/>Good. <br/>Super. <br/>Jeff: Another tough storm. Some of the worst weather we've ever had on Survivor. How are you guys doing, Mariano? <br/>ROB M.: We're doing good. <br/>Jeff: Shelter holding up, Rob? <br/>ROB M.: Yeah, so far, so good. <br/>Jeff: Saboga, how are you guys doing? Down a couple of members. The rain has been awful. How did the shelter hold up? <br/>RUPERT: It could've weathered a little better. <br/>JENNA: But we all got showers. <br/>RUPERT: Yeah. <br/>Jeff: What's going on with Mogo Mogo? Lex? <br/>LEX: Richard actually caught three more eels: one  four-foot, one three-foot, and one probably two-foot, so... it's a good life. It's really good. <br/>KATHY: He's like King Neptune out there. <br/>SUE: That must be better eel than what you caught when I  was with you, 'cause that was all bone. <br/>RICHARD: I was feeding you, honey. <br/>SUE: That was all bone. <br/>RICHARD: That's why I gave it to you. <br/>SUE: 'Cause you have no bone to give me, Richard. <br/>RICHARD: That is absolutely true, honey. <br/>Jeff: Well, I'm glad you to see you guys are in a good  mood. Should make for a fun challenge. We thought for today's reward challenge, we would give you a  chance to finally interact while testing your memory skills. Here's how it's going to work: each tribe member will have their  own station. Inside each station are four items relating to island living. Your goal is to find another tribe member who has a matching  item. Every time you get a match, you score a point for your tribe. You can match an item with somebody from your own tribe. You can match an item with somebody from another tribe. Doesn't matter. When you find a match, you score a point. The tribe who scores the most correct matches wins reward. One more thing: you let somebody peek inside your container,  it's your problem. Want to know what your playing for? <br/>Of course. <br/>Jeff: It is a Survivor bathroom. <br/>Wow! <br/>SUE: Oh, my god! <br/>ALICIA: Oh, my God, it's a little john. <br/>Jeff: Got a solar shower, nice toilet... a little toilet  paper. <br/>ROB C.: Toilet paper's nice. <br/>Jeff: Look at this, a little Scope. <br/>ALL: Wow. <br/>Jeff: How good would this be? Some Crest and a, uh... on a toothbrush, scrub your teeth. Body wash. Everything you need to get good and clean, smell good again. In addition, first place and second place get another clue to  their lock box. In the lock box, rice. So that means for Mogo Mogo and Chapera, this would be your  final clue, which means you could theoretically have rice tonight. Chapera, you have to two extra members. You're sitting two people out. Who's sitting out? <br/>SUE: Me. <br/>ROB C. Mom and Dad. <br/>Jeff: Big Tom and Sue, you're sitting out. Mogo Mogo, you have one extra member. Who's sitting out? <br/>COLBY: I'll sit out, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Donaldson's sitting out. Take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, take a spot behind one of your stations. Wait for my go. Okay, we randomly drew numbers to decide who would go first. Chapera won. Mariano, you're up first. <br/>ROB M.: Pretty boy. <br/>Jeff: Who's pretty boy? <br/>ROB M.: Wow, he looked right at me. Must be a sign. <br/>Jeff: Ethan? <br/>ROB M.: You got a rock in there? <br/>ETHAN: I think you got a couple up here, don't you? <br/>ROB C.: Oh, snap. <br/>ETHAN: I'm sorry, my friend, I don't. <br/>Jeff: No match. Richard Hatch? <br/>RICHARD: Hey, Mariano, you got a rock? <br/>Jeff: That's how the game works. <br/>RICHARD: Thanks, bud. <br/>Jeff: Nice job. First match for Mogo Mogo. Rupert? <br/>RUPERT: You got a sponge? <br/>AMBER: I do have a sponge. <br/>Jeff: A match for Saboga. Amber? <br/>AMBER: Kathy, do you have a seed? <br/>KATHY: Me? By God, I do. Damn it. <br/>Jeff: Look at Amber covering that box. Chapera on the board. Kathy? <br/>KATHY: Hey, Cesternino. <br/>ROB C.: Kathy, big fan. <br/>KATHY: I love you, too, even though you're a snake. Give me your shell. Reach in there and get it for me. Whoo! I can just read your mind, buddy. <br/>ROB C. Can you read it now? [laughter]  Jeff: Ethan? <br/>ETHAN: Shii Ann, do you have any coral? <br/>Jeff: How are you guys doing this? <br/>This is unbelievable. <br/>SHII ANN: Yes, I do. <br/>KATHY: No food makes you more psychic. <br/>ETHAN: You've got to make these boxes a little thicker. <br/>Jeff: All right, Cesternino. <br/>ROB C.: Lex, do you have any coral? <br/>Jeff: Unbelievable. We're tied up, each tribe with two matches. Lex? <br/>LEX: Jenna, could you tickle me with your feather? <br/>JENNA: No. <br/>Jeff: Finally, a real human. <br/>ALICIA: Lex, do you have a feather? <br/>LEX: Oh...  Jeff: Another match for Chapera. <br/>JERRI: Rich, do you have a coconut shell? <br/>RICHARD: Hell no, but I'll pretend I do. <br/>Jeff: Dickie...  ROB M.: Dickie, give me your driftwood. <br/>RICHARD: I knew I lifted it too high. <br/>SUE: Good job, Boston Rob. <br/>Jeff: Mariano with another match for Chapera. <br/>RICHARD: Rob, give me your sea sponge. <br/>ROB C.: You will never get my sea sponge. <br/>RUPERT: Okay, Jenna, I'll take your rock. <br/>ETHAN: Jenna, why don't you just leave it open? [ laughing] Here, leave it open and turn it around. <br/>Jeff: Saboga and Chapera tied at four. Mogo Mogo at two. <br/>ROB. C: Ethan, do you have a coconut shell? <br/>ETHAN: How'd you know? How did you know that? <br/>TOM: Good job, Robbie. <br/>Jeff: Lex? <br/>LEX: Jenna. <br/>JENNA: Lex? <br/>LEX: How'd you feel about giving me a little sponge bath? <br/>Jeff: Lex, do you know that because she left her box open? <br/>LEX: That's right. Aw, thank you, sweetheart. Easy, easy. <br/>ROB C.: I already know what you have. I don't need...  LEX: Oh, shut up. You know nothing. <br/>Jeff: Alicia? <br/>ALICIA: Hey, Lex, do you have a coconut husk? <br/>LEX: Aw! <br/>Jeff: And Lex is empty. <br/>Yay! <br/>ALICIA: You're my man. Never forget it. <br/>Jeff: Shii Ann? <br/>SHII ANN: Alicia. <br/>ALICIA: Yes. <br/>SHII ANN: Do you have a feather? <br/>ALICIA: I already gave my feather. <br/>RUPERT: Shii Ann, you got a feather? <br/>Jeff: Rupert with another match for Saboga. Chapera at six, Saboga at five, Mogo Mogo at three. Amber. <br/>AMBER: Jenna, do you have any driftwood? <br/>JENNA: Yes. <br/>Jeff: Amber with another match for Chapera. Nicely done. Jenna's box is empty. She's out of the game. Amber's box is empty. She's out of the game. Kathy? <br/>LEX: Come on, kitty cat. <br/>KATHY: Okay, Cesternino, you got a rock? <br/>ROB C.: I do have a rock. <br/>Jeff: Mogo Mogo with another match. <br/>ROB C.: I'm empty. <br/>Jeff: Ethan, you're up. <br/>ETHAN: Jerri, do you have a shell? <br/>JERRI: I do. <br/>Jeff: Saboga with another match. <br/>SHII ANN: Boston Rob, do you have a shell I could have? <br/>Jeff: Mogo Mogo with another match. <br/>JERRI: Alicia, do you have a piece of coral by any chance? <br/>ALICIA: No. <br/>Jeff: No means yes? <br/>ALICIA: No means yes in this, uh, situation. <br/>JERRI: Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Jerri with a match for Saboga. Very tight game. There are only three matches left. Rupert? <br/>RUPERT: Kathy, do you have driftwood? <br/>KATHY: No, really? <br/>RUPERT: Oh, my gosh. Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Rupert now out of the game. Kathy now out of the game. That leaves Boston Rob, Richard, Alicia and Jerri. Mariano. <br/>ROB M.: Richard, please tell me you got the sea sponge. <br/>Jeff: A match for Chapera. Richard's out of the game. Mariano's now out of the game. Here's where we're at Alicia. You get this right, Chapera wins. Game over. Saboga in second. <br/>ALICIA: Gotcha. Jerri, do you have a seed? <br/>JERRI: I do have a seed. <br/>Jeff: Nicely done. Chapera, rice tonight. In addition, when you're done with the rice, take a shower, get  cleaned up. You guys can head back to camp. Chapera, this is yours to take back with you. Wait, wait, wait. Smell. [ cheering]  ROB M.: Oh, man. <br/>ROB C.: Tommy john, come on, let's go. <br/>ALICIA: We are going to be clean. <br/>ROB M.: This is a little bit insane. We had to carry everything that we won back to our camp, and,  uh, Big Tom put the toilet over his head. I'm willing to bet it's not the first time Big Tom's had his  head in the toilet. <br/>We're taking a bath in the ocean. <br/>Oh, oh, so nice. <br/>ROB C.: After 11 days out here, it was nice to take a  bath. [ groans] [ laughs]  ROB M.: Amber and I, we're not so sure if it's a good idea  if we bathed each other, because the, uh, tribe might get the wrong idea. However, soap and scrubs with the women...  AMBER: Let's just do this all day long every day. <br/>TOM: Winning the bathroom products-- it boosted our  morale. And the other thing about winning the challenge is we got  another clue for the key that would unlock our box for the rice. "Not in search of keys, but you've all been there before. Every day, a place for you to go to find out what's in  store."  ROB C.: Tree mail. <br/>TOM: "Stand in front and face it. It will point the way. "Start your count behind, and you're just ten paces away. "Once that's done, you will surely see. It's in a shallow grave, so dig carefully."  ROB M.: Six, seven, eight, nine. It's right here. It's got to be. A big root. How much is a pace? <br/>TOM: I think what threw us off the most was how far is a  pace? You know, my pace is different than a midget's pace. <br/>ROB M.: How much is a pace? <br/>ROB C.: I would think it's a step. The search for the key turned out more like the search for the  Holy Grail meets the opening of Al Capone's safe. <br/>ROB M.: I think you're going the wrong way. I think we got to dig this way. <br/>ROB C.: You can dig that way. This is my chance to be the hero. I've never been the hero before. Before this day is over, I'm going to dig up this whole entire  beach. <br/>ROB M.: It's in the back. It's got to be in the back. I look over, the kid's building a friggin' sand castle on the  beach. It looks like he's 12 years old. You know, he's got his shovel there, and he's just putting it  together. This kid's living in, like, la-la-land. Right here. It's got to be right here. <br/>ALICIA: Fingers crossed. <br/>ROB M.: I think it's deep. I got it. I got it! [ whooping] Yeah, baby! <br/>ALICIA: Shake it. [ key rattles in bottle]  ROB M.: We got it. [ sighs of relief] There it is. <br/>SUE: Oh. <br/>AMBER: Is this water? What is this? <br/>ALICIA: You guys, that's alcohol. That's whiskey. <br/>ROB C.: Oh, my god. <br/>ALICIA: It's whiskey. [ Amber yells happily]  AMBER: We got rice! <br/>ROB M.: We're rolling in this game. <br/>ALL: One, two, three, rice! <br/>TOM: For us to have rice in our system, it's just like gas  in the tank. And I think it's going to give us a little bit of, just that  little more hoochie. <br/>ALICIA: Oh, my god. I don't know how anybody's going to stop us at this point  because we're so far ahead of the other tribes now, it's insane. I feel sorry for them. Not. [giggles]  RUPERT: We got some sleep [giggles]  RUPERT: We got some sleep last night in that new shelter. It was nice to get a few hours uninterrupted, relaxing sleep. We all feel at least100% better than yesterday morning. [ laughing]  JERRI: I slept in this morning. I needed to. I'm in such a better space now. Saboga's looking up. Rupert's out trying to get more oysters and snails and trying to  catch some fish. I was working on improving the roof so that when the heavy rain  comes again, it'll be ready to be waterproof. Jenna got water. We're all just trying to set up a comfortable surrounding. [ Jenna gasps] [ Rupert laughs]  ETHAN: Oh, that's a nice one. <br/>JENNA L.: So, we got fire, shelter and a big meal, so it  was really redemption, sort of. It felt really good. <br/>RUPERT: You guys ready? <br/>JENNA L.: That's a lot of seafood. Mm, this one's tough. <br/>RUPERT: Yeah, they're kind of chewy. A few more shrimps. <br/>JENNA L: Rupert, thank you so much. Ethan, thank you. <br/>RUPERT: You're very, very welcome. <br/>JERRI: I'm already looking so far ahead of now and that's,  I think, what's keeping me sane 'cause yesterday morning, I about lost it  after that storm. I didn't think I was going to be able to snap out of it. I literally experienced a moment where I realized how people go  mad. And it was scary. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! How's everybody doing? <br/>Good. <br/>Good. <br/>Jeff: You ready for today's immunity challenge? <br/>JENNA L.: Yes. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, we will test how well you  communicate within your own tribe. One person will be your eyes. They will be the guide. The other tribe members will be blindfolded. Using only verbal commands, the guide will direct their tribe to  find 15 pieces of the puzzle scattered out along the beach. You'll bring back the pieces and place them in your team's  square. Once all the pieces are inside, take off your blindfolds, start  putting the puzzle together. The first two tribes to complete their puzzle win immunity. Who's going to be the guide for Saboga? Jerri. Chapera? Alicia. How about for Mogo Mogo? Richard Hatch. Chapera, you have two extra members. Who's sitting out today? Amber and Rob. Mogo Mogo, who's sitting out? Shii Ann. Sit outs, over here. Everybody else get blindfolded, wait for my go. Callers in place, tribes are blindfolded. For immunity, survivors ready? Go! <br/>ALICIA: To your right, to your right. Keep side stepping right, Sue. Side step right, Sue. <br/>JERRI: Coming to the hill. You're going to go down the hill, down the hill, in the water. <br/>RICHARD: Kathy, left! Kathy left! You got it, Kathy, right there. <br/>ROB M.: Alicia? <br/>ALICIA: Rob, side step right! Side step right! Good, good. Go forward, Rob, go forward. Grab it. You got it. Keep going, keep going! Big Tom, go forward! Go forward, go forward, go forward! Big Tom, you've got it! Tom, come to my voice! <br/>ROB M.: Alicia! <br/>ALICIA: Drop it, drop it. Turn around and go straight. <br/>Jeff: Chapera with their first piece. <br/>RICHARD: Kathy, keep coming. You got it. <br/>JERRI: Rupert, Rupert, you're running into Jenna. Rupert, go to your right. Right, right, right. Jenna, go to your right! Rupert, stop! Down. Set it down. <br/>Jeff: Saboga with a second piece. <br/>JERRI: Ethan, keep going straight. <br/>Jeff: Saboga with a third piece. <br/>JERRI: Set it down. You're there. RICHARD: Colby, Colby, Colby. <br/>Jeff: Ethan throws it on Colby. <br/>RICHARD: Okay, you're good. <br/>Jeff: It's become an obstacle course. <br/>RICHARD: Kathy, turn right! <br/>Jeff: Tied up at three. <br/>ALICIA: Tom, you're done! Go straight! That's it, that's it! Bring it in, bring it in. Drop it, drop it. <br/>Jeff: Big Tom takes a header. <br/>RICHARD: Lex, right. Lex, right. Lex, left. Straight. <br/>ALICIA: Drop it, Sue. Drop it, Sue, drop it. <br/>Jeff: Sue with another piece for Chapera. [ Tom grunts]  ALICIA: Watch out, watch out! To your left! Sue, to your left! Left! Now, Sue, go straight! Sue go straight! <br/>RICHARD: Lex! Lex! Turn around, go, go forward. Forward. Forward. <br/>ALICIA: Now, Sue, go straight! Sue, go straight! To your left, Sue, and straight! Rob, stop! <br/>JERRI: Drop it! Drop it! <br/>Jeff: Saboga with 11 pieces. Chapera at nine, Mogo Mogo with seven. <br/>RICHARD: Kathy, left! Kathy left! Kathy, please don't move! Kathy, just stand there! Lex, listen to me! I can't see you! <br/>LEX: Rich? <br/>RICHARD: Have you got any? <br/>LEX: No. <br/>RICHARD: All right, Lex, come back. I can't see you back there! I can't tell if there's a anything! [ Tom grunts]  ROB C.: Oh, damn it! <br/>Jeff: Big Tom just got clobbered by Colby. <br/>RICHARD: Colby, you're good. <br/>Jeff: Big Tom may be hurt. <br/>ALICIA: Step to your right. Now throw it down. <br/>Jeff: Chapera at 14, Saboga at 14, Mogo Mogo at 12. <br/>RICHARD: Lex, take a right. Good. Keep going straight. <br/>Jeff: Chapera has their last piece. Take your blindfolds off, start building the puzzle. Chapera first to start building the puzzle. Saboga working together. Stuck in a tree. <br/>JERRI: Yes, get over the tree. Straight towards me. <br/>Jeff: Rupert with Saboga's last piece. He's got to get it in the box. <br/>RICHARD: Right. <br/>Jeff: First two tribes to finish win immunity. <br/>RICHARD: Lex, left. Lex, Lex, Lex, Lex, Lex, Lex. Stand up, face me, walk two steps forward. Swing your arms! <br/>JERRI: Perfect. Rupert, go a little bit to your right. <br/>Jeff: Saboga with all 15. Start building the puzzle. Take off the blindfolds. First two tribes to finish win immunity. <br/>JERRI: Bring that piece right there. That piece, Ethan. <br/>Jeff: Chapera working hard. All those got to match up, guys. <br/>RICHARD: Kathy, put that over in the box. That's in the box. <br/>Jeff: Mogo Mogo, get the blindfolds off. Let's start building that puzzle. You're still in this. The colors have to line up. <br/>LEX: Make sure you put blanks on the bottom. <br/>JENNA L.: That's a circle? No. <br/>JERRI: Yes. Yes, it is! Trust me. <br/>Jeff: Jerri continues to lead Saboga. <br/>ROB M.: Why is this two different colors? <br/>Jeff: Chapera struggling with their puzzle. Other tribes catching up. <br/>SUE: There, right there. There you go. Okay, that's it. Why not? Oh, two different colors. <br/>JERRI: Slide it in. Last piece, guys. Last piece. Last piece. <br/>Jeff: Saboga, first tribe to win immunity. <br/>RUPERT: Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Keep fighting, Mogo Mogo. Keep fighting, Chapera. <br/>SUE: Don't destroy the whole thing. The wall is good here. <br/>Jeff: You are still fighting for immunity, Mogo Mogo. <br/>LEX: Okay, this is right. That goes there. Take that out right there. <br/>COLBY: Lex... Yeah, yeah. Go over there, Hatch. <br/>SHII ANN: Come on, Mogo Mogo. <br/>LEX: That goes right there. <br/>Jeff: That a way to work, Mogo Mogo. <br/>JENNA L.: Come on, Mogo Mogo. Send one of them home. <br/>SUE: Let's take this piece out. Yeah, No, it's not, because we go higher than that, Alicia. We go that high. <br/>RICHARD: Hold on, hold on. <br/>COLBY: Yeah, baby, yeah baby. <br/>RICHARD: Hold on. <br/>COLBY: Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Mogo Mogo wins immunity. <br/>COLBY: Yeah, baby, yeah! <br/>KATHY: Oh, that was so great, you guys. <br/>JERRI: I can't believe we got all the pieces first. <br/>Jeff: Saboga, some tough days, but a break tonight-- no  Tribal Council. <br/>JERRI: Hello, lady. <br/>Jeff: Mogo Mogo, once again immunity. <br/>LEX: On three. One, two, three...  ALL: Mogo Mogo! <br/>Jeff: Chapera, first time in Tribal Council, first member  to be voted out of the tribe tonight. You have the afternoon to think about who that's going to be. Head back to camp. <br/>AMBER: Yeah, it was so frustrating to watch. It was so frustrating to watch. <br/>SUE: It's like, okay, we want brown with pink circle. <br/>AMBER: And then you think you were getting somewhere and  then all of a sudden you had to start all over again. <br/>SUE: Oh, it was so bad. <br/>ROB M.: Always a way. You can't just have, like, a really good day all day long. Today was our first immunity loss. I mean, this is the first time we've got to go to Tribal  Council. It's day 12, and we just got to really start playing the game  now. <br/>ROB C.: I felt so bad for you guys when you were taking all  those body shots. <br/>ROB M.: A tough challenge, man. ROB C.: Today's challenge was especially frustrating. I think that, with the crew that we had in there, that was not  our best puzzle-building team. And I think if I was in there, maybe we could have won. I hope the lesson learned here is that my tribe needs me. <br/>TOM: I smell you. I can't see if we were to vote Rob C. off tonight, that would make us the strongest team. Honestly, I think Rob C. would have been an asset to this challenge because we got beat  putting the puzzle together, and I do know that his mind would have worked  that puzzle. I think Rob C's brain is better than Alicia's. That's the question we've got to ask ourselves, you know, where  are we the strongest? <br/>ROB C.: You want a piece? It's not that great. <br/>ALICIA: No, thank you, babe. <br/>SUE: Oh, man. <br/>ALICIA: I love Rob Cesternino. He's a great guy. I sense that the past couple of days, though, he's known that  his head may be on the chopping block. Nobody's really talking about it a lot, though, which is  interesting. Usually people rally-- especially, this is the first Tribal  Council-- just to make sure we're all on the same page. I haven't heard one thing. That makes me a little nervous. <br/>ROB M.: I know you know how to play the game. <br/>ROB C.: Mm-hmm. <br/>ROB M.: And I know you know a lot. I know you'll be very, like, helpful, and we can make good  allies. <br/>ROB C.: I... I agree. Would you be open to considering getting rid of Alicia before  Sue? <br/>ROB M.: So you want to get rid of Alicia and then... Sue? <br/>ROB C.: Yeah. <br/>ROB M.: Me, you, and I think Amber can-can do it. <br/>ROB C.: I do get nervous, and I do get paranoid in this  game, but...  ROB M.: With cause. <br/>ROB C.: ...as long as I have your-your assurance on this,  then I'm good. <br/>ROB M.: Mm. Want to shake on it? <br/>ROB C.: I made an alliance with Boston Rob, and he says  that the alliance is me, him and Amber. But I don't know how good Boston Rob's word is, but I've got his  back, and a deal's a deal. <br/>ALICIA: You guys almost ready to eat rice? <br/>ROB M.: This is good. <br/>TOM: Yeah. <br/>ROB M.: There's a possibility at this first Tribal Council  that there could be at least one of three people going-- Cesternino, Sue, or  Alicia. I haven't made up my mind yet, but when I do, that's the person  that'll be going home. <br/>Jeff: Go ahead and grab a torch and approach the flame. You're going to dip your torch in and get fire. This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council, because as you all  know, fire represents life on the island and this game. As long as you have fire, you're still in the game. When your fire's gone, so are you. First time for Chapera at Tribal Council. So let's talk about the first 12 days. Big Tom? Is this tougher physically? <br/>TOM: Physically it's pretty tough. All the challenges so far, I've had to suck it up. But when you go all out, as this tribe has done, every  challenge, it'll get to you. <br/>Jeff: Rob, how does this compare physically? <br/>ROB C.: Physically, no doubt, this game is much harder  than the other games that-that we've played, but that's what we signed up  for. This is All-Star. <br/>Jeff: Amber, is there anything in your normal life that  you notice you're now able to contribute out here? <br/>AMBER: I think I'm very good at controlling my temper and  not losing it, and I think we have a few in our tribe who tend to lose their  temper pretty quickly or throw fits. And I think I'm very good at calming people down and talking  some sense into them. <br/>Jeff: Who doeslose their temper? [ Amber laughs]  AMBER: Well, I think, uh, Boston Rob and Alicia kind of  argue back and forth a little bit...  ALICIA: We only did once. How many times did we argue? <br/>ROB M.: Only one time. We quelled that real-real quickly. <br/>ALICIA: Once. We put a kibosh on it. <br/>Jeff: Sue, what is the impact of losing this challenge? <br/>SUE: Us losing today actually probably made us more  dangerous for the rest of the challenges. <br/>Jeff: Because you gave yourselves a wake-up call? <br/>SUE: Yes. Yes. <br/>Jeff: By the way, Big Tom, how are you feeling? 'Cause you took a hard hit to the chest or the head today. <br/>TOM: I didn't see it coming. And, uh, the only thing I asked them was, I wanted them to get  the tag number off that truck that hit me. <br/>Jeff: First 12 days for Chapera, up until today, have been  pretty cush. Big Tom, are you noticing relationships form? <br/>TOM: There's a little bit of... I've been noticing  cuddling, and there might be a little grinding there late one night. <br/>Jeff: You looked at Boston Rob when you said that. <br/>TOM: Well, I've been kind of watching him a little bit,  and he don't sleep on his back every night. [ quiet laughter]  Jeff: Who are you sleeping next to, Boston Rob? <br/>ROB M.: I'm sleeping next to Amber. <br/>Jeff: Are you blushing? <br/>AMBER: No. <br/>Jeff: A little bit? <br/>AMBER: No. <br/>Jeff: A little something going on? <br/>AMBER: I'm 25. I'm young and having fun. <br/>TOM: I'm 48 and old and watching having fun. [ Amber laughs]  Jeff: Is there a little snuggling going on with, uh,  Boston Rob? <br/>AMBER: We need to keep warm at night. <br/>Jeff: So this is strictly survival cuddling. <br/>AMBER: I'm out here to play the game of Survivor. I'm not out here to play a dating game. <br/>Jeff: Alicia, give me the straight scoop. <br/>ALICIA: Okay, these two are-- You can't even get between  them. You got to be kidding me. Seriously, they're very close. I wouldn't even try to sleep next to Boston Rob and push Amber  to the other side. That's-that's even out of the question. <br/>Jeff: Does that concern you, Boston Rob, that there might  be an impression formed? <br/>ROB M: No. It's obvious. I mean, we've been flirting with each other from day one, since  we got out here. But in terms of the game, there's going to be one winner, and my  commitment to the game is first and foremost. <br/>Jeff: So let's talk about how you're going to vote  somebody out tonight. What do you base it on, Big Tom? <br/>TOM: Right now I was thinking about our tribe and making  it stronger going into challenges...  Jeff: So you're basing your vote on who the tribe can  afford to lose? <br/>TOM: Yeah. Basically, yes. <br/>Jeff: What-What could cause you to get voted off tonight,  Boston Rob? <br/>ROB M.: I guess my mouth and my attitude. What else, Amber? [Amber, Rob M. laugh]  Jeff: Wow, you guys really have become a couple. [ laughter] You just asked your wife. That was pretty telling. What else could get Boston Rob in trouble? <br/>AMBER: I just think he has a big mouth, and he needs to  keep it shut a lot, at challenges, at camp, all the time. He has a big mouth, and he needs to keep it shut. <br/>ROB M.: I'm very emotional, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Sue, worried at all that it might be you, really? <br/>SUE: Oh, yeah. Ever since I stepped on the island. <br/>Jeff: Why vote you out? <br/>SUE: 'Cause I can just be a bitch to be around sometimes. I mean, you know... Hey? <br/>TOM: Hoo-ha. I didn't say nothing. [ laughter]  SUE: So, yeah, and I don't go around sucking up to people  or trying to pretend to be something I'm not. <br/>Jeff: Okay. It is time to vote. Rob, you're up. <br/>ROB C.: I'm a little uneasy about this vote tonight, but  if everything goes through with this, I have a feeling the next time I see  you, there's going to be a big finger wagging in my face. <br/>ALICIA: Rob C., you're a face. <br/>ALICIA: Rob C., you're a great guy, and you're really  funny, but I think what we need from here on out is a little more seriousness. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote-- Rob C. Alicia. One vote, Alicia, one vote, Rob. Rob. Two votes Rob, one vote Alicia. Rob. Three votes Rob, one vote Alicia. The first person voted out of Chapera. Rob. That's enough. The last vote will remain a mystery. Rob, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Jeff: Well, you guys have had Rob, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Jeff: Well, you guys have had a good easy first 12 days. You just suffered your first loss. The game has just begun. Grab your torches, head back to camp.

Next time on Survivor,Rupert gets a shot at redemption when the  tribes have to build a raft. <br/>RUPERT: I feel good about the raft. I'm trying to not think about the house. <br/>Jeff: At Chapera...  ROB M.: I got your waterbed for you. <br/>TOM: That's the best built thing since Alicia. <br/>SUE: Tom-- he's a stupid drunk. <br/>Jeff: And the tribes face the first big twist of the game. <br/>SHII ANN: Wow! <br/>ROB C.: I'm just very disappointed that I didn't really  have a chance to get into the game. I feel like I was kind of targeted unfairly. What can I say? Not many people get to play Survivoronce in a lifetime. I got to play it twice. The first time at Tribal Council. I guess I'll take it as a sign of respect from the rest of the  team, but it's going to take a little while to swallow this one.
