<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor... James found the second hidden immunity  idol at Zhan Hu. <br/>I have it now. I have it in my possession. I have it in my possession. I'm on Survivorwith two idols. I'm on Survivorwith two idols. <br/>Jeff: Erik found the plaque James discarded, and Jaime suspected it might be  an immunity idol. <br/>If I play the hidden immunity idol tonight, it's probably going to shock  everyone. I'm not as dumb as I look, and maybe they're figuring it out. <br/>Jeff: The next day, the two tribes merged... Drop your buffs. You are merged. ...and enjoyed a celebration feast. <br/>Sweet and sour pork, you guys. <br/>Beef. <br/>Beef. <br/>Whoa! Easy! <br/>Jeff's here! <br/>Jeff: What up? In an unexpected challenge... You will be tested on your recollection of  events that happened during the feast and the celebration. Frosti was the first to win individual immunity. The former Zhan Hu were outnumbered by the former Fei Long. <br/>Now all we have to do is put the nails in the coffin and bury them. <br/>Jeff: Convinced they had a hidden idol, Jaime and Erik planned to use it to  get rid of planned to use it to get rid of Jean-Robert. Jean-Robert. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, I-/////!ll read the votes. Jaime played the idol while a shocked Jean-Robert looked on. The rules of Survivorstate if the immunity idol is played, any votes cast  against that person will not count, and the person with the next highest  number of votes will be sent home. This, however, is not a hidden immunity idol. <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>Jeff: Jaime, Erik, and Peih[1]Gee  voted for Jean-Robert. But the former members of Fei Long stuck together, and Jaime became the first  member of the jury. Nine are left. Nine are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>I know. I was, like, terrified. I was like, "Oh, my gosh."  I mean, I knew 100% I'm going home. At tribal council, I had a close call. Jaime pulled this little plaque out of her bag. I mean, I was like, "Is this really happening? Could this possibly be that she found an individual immunity idol somewhere  in our camp?"  Before you get in bed, Erik has to go back there. <br/>Well, just move over! <br/>Well, just move over! Move over. Move over. What the hell? Well, goodness gracious, sakes alive. <br/>You wouldn't want to move. <br/>You wouldn't want to move. So shut up, James. So shut up, James. [ laughter]  Jean Robert don't know that I have both immunity idols. We can't tell him that, because it's Jean-Robert. He's going to mess something up. We just need to keep his dumb ass in line just because we're stuck with him  now. We need his vote, so we have to We need his vote, so we have to deal with it. deal with it.

They're not trying to win a million dollars. They were trying to win the high They were trying to win the high school  friend contest. school friend contest. I just got two of them, because they're catching too fast. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Wow! <br/>That is beautiful!

So you guys ready to get to your reward challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, you will be divided into two teams of four.

James, it is now your selection. <br/>Todd. <br/>Jeff: James chooses Todd. <br/>Frosti, it's now your pick, who do you want? <br/>I guess I'll go with Erik. <br/>Jeff: We are right back where we started-- three Fei Long members, three Zhan  Hu members. Todd who do you want? <br/>I-/////!ll take Amanda. <br/>Jeff: Amanda finishes out the Yellow Team. Erik, you have one choice to make-- it is between Denise and Courtney. Who will be the final person participating in this challenge? <br/>We're going to go with Courtney because she's light. <br/>Jeff: Courtney. <br/>Sorry, Denise. <br/>That's all right. <br/>Jeff: Take a spot along with Erik, Frosti, and Peih-Gee on team red.

It is for all four of you. Jean-Robert, catch. Have a good time. Have a good time. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>This is amazing. <br/>How cool, eh? <br/>The reward was nice. We had the opportunity to go and see a thousand-year-old village. Now, I mean, I'm not really one to enjoy the romantic side of stuff, but when  you walk in the place, the construction of everything, and you could feel,  like, the history, that was really nice. <br/>Guys, where are we? Like, oh, my god, this is unbelievable. <br/>This is authentic Chinese dining. This is the real deal. This is the real deal. Wow. Wow. <br/>Idol clue. There is a hidden immunity idol. Wow. <br/>Really? <br/>All right, here we go. "This is the final clue to the whereabouts of hidden immunity."  I've got to tell you, when I read this, I was, like, a little bit surprised. As much information as there has been out there, I should have known  something. I should have had some sort of clue. I mean, that shook me up a little bit. "Hidden immunity idol clue number one-- what is thought to be hidden may  sometimes be seen. <br/>When Jean-Robert busted open those clues for the hidden immunity idol, it was  kind of funny, because there's no idol out there. It's already been found. James has both immunity idols, and Jean-Robert is the only one from Fei Long  who doesn't know about it. <br/>This is big, guys. I mean, winning today's challenge...  Exactly. <br/>Bigger than dinner and culture. <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Mmm! <br/>Wonderful, yes! <br/>Oh, there's more coming, still. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Wow, wontons are great. <br/>Yeah. <br/>James, you think they know how to make wontons here? <br/>I do believe. This place has been here a thousand years. I think they might have made a wonton or two. What you think? Hand me them peanuts. Hand me them peanuts. <br/>This is the best day ever. <br/>This is the best day ever. <br/>Everybody made the perfect picks. <br/>So, what do you do with that afterwards? Where do you store it? What do you do? You had it before. What did you do with it? <br/>It disappeared. <br/>Oh, it disappears. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm not bringing that back. Are you bringing it back? <br/>Hell, no. <br/>Well, you better jog your memory, homey. <br/>I did not know there was an American immunity idol. <br/>American immunity idol. Cool. That's great. There's an American immunity idol. <br/>We could really have some fun with this, you guys. Jean-Robert has no idea. I think that was the best part of the whole evening was hearing him talk  about finding this idol-- "What do you guys think it can be? I don't know where it is."  Guys, I've been drinking wine all right? all right? American immunity idol. American immunity idol. <br/>I'm very upset right now. You know, what am I going to do, though? I mean, there was a pick today at the challenge. I mean, I was standing there, you know, looking at everybody, and just  sitting on the bench. And, you know, I'm big, I'm fat, I'm always the last one picked. I mean, it's been like that my whole life. whole life. And here it is again. And here it is again. You know, I mean, you're the last one standing there. Are they going to do that when it comes down to the final seven? Am I going to be the one that's going to go home before J.R? Am I going to be one that goes home before James? I don't want to be that person. You know, I want to stay in this You know, I want to stay in this game as  long as I possibly can. game as long as I possibly can. <br/>I guess, you know, James is probably a bigger threat. <br/>No, J.R. is a major threat. <br/>I want J.R. I think he's kind of more of the full threat package. <br/>There's five of us here. I'm, like, "Wait a minute." I was like, "If we all band  together, it will be four to five, and guess what?" Jean-Robert and  James, oh, Amanda, okay, bye. I kind of have nothing to lose. Like, I'll try anything at this point. You know, if J.R. goes out before I do, if either you or Courtney are on final two, I'll give  either one of you my vote. Because I would love to see him Because I would love to see him taken out  before me. taken out before me. <br/>Peih-Gee is trying to shake things up and get us to vote out Jean-Robert. Nobody likes him, so it's kind of an easy vote. If I decide to go with Peih-Gee and Erik, I could end up in a good situation  with them, but I don't want to go against the rest of the tribe and have them  vote against me. So I'm thinking it over and deciding what I'm going to do. If I think the best way for me is to go with you guys, then I'm going to go  with you guys. If I think the best way for me is to go with them, then I'm going to go with  them. I'm going to tell you that honestly, honestly, Straight up. Straight up. <br/>I didn't even sleep last night, I was so anxious to get that immunity idol. I mean, that's the difference in the game. That could protect me. That could be my million That could be my million dollars right there. dollars right there. I looked around, and I remember some clue about four bats, and I know it's  above, and I got the feeling that it was someplace where we walk every time  we come home. So I decided it was probably So I decided it was probably one of those mini  pagodas. one of those mini pagodas. Now I'm thinking it might be one of these plaques. The four bats thing makes sense, one of the plaques. So right now I think I'm going to try to take the other three down, and I can  figure out which down, and I can figure out which one of them is right. one of them is right. If I have the immunity idol, it gives me a trump card. I like the direction I'm going, but I feel more comfortable with the trump  card in my pocket knowing that the general public doesn't have access to it  right doesn't have access to it right now. now. <br/>James, you eat a good one[1]fourth  of what's in there. <br/>Oh, I do. <br/>You average probably two and a half times the average person. <br/>I'm not like you. I'm not laying down...  No, no, no, don't say like me. When you were gone I was out there fishing and I never ate more than my fair  portion, okay? Please don't say like me. <br/>We have been in the jungle for 23 days now, and these people are driving me  insane. I hate hearing Jean-Robert's voice. I hate hearing James complain how he's so hungry. Plus it kind of pisses me off that James has both hidden immunity idols,  being that I found it and told him where the other one was, and he hasn't  even offered to give one back. That drives me insane. So I would love to see some So I would love to see some craziness happen here  at camp. craziness happen here at camp. <br/>James, he's got himself in a great position. With that hidden immunity idol, he's guaranteed in the final four. four. You know it. You know it. Yeah, people would be like, "You played a great game James. played a great game James. You did fantastic, here you go." You did fantastic, here you go."  What if he keeps winning, winning, idol, idol? Hell, no am I messing with two idols like that. If James doesn't win immunity, If James doesn't win immunity, he might have  to go. he might have to go. If he's guaranteed that Peih-Gee is going, he won't play that idol. <br/>The plan was originally to get rid of Peih-Gee next, and then Erik and Frosti  after that. Now, all of a sudden, Todd is in a big hurry to get rid of James, and him  changing so quickly, like, really makes me nervous. <br/>You know what I mean? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And...  And... We will not tell Peih-Gee. <br/>All right. <br/>Because we can't, because she will tell James. <br/>In this game, you've got to take advantage of whatever happens whenever you  can. And right now, people are starting to view me as a swing vote, which ends up  being not so bad. <br/>Sound good? Sounds good. <br/>I'm always looking for a chance to make sure that I'm safe, so right now, the  plan is to not let James win immunity at this next challenge and blindside  him at tribal tonight. blindside him at tribal tonight. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: First things first. Frosti, you mind bringing it Frosti, you mind bringing it over? over? Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you are going to balance on a large barrel that is  filled with water. There is a hole on the bottom of the barrel. As the water drains out, it will become more and more unstable, making it  more difficult to keep your balance. When you fall off, you're out. Last person left sitting on their barrel wins immunity, is guaranteed a one  in eight shot at a million dollars. We've already drawn for positions. Take your spots. We'll get started. All right, here we go. Everybody sit up straight. First lever you're going to push is the yellow lever. That will pull the plug, allowing the water to drain out of your barrel. Three, two, one, push. Now, push the red one forward. Keep in mind, when you push the red one forward, your barrel is now not  locked anymore. now not locked anymore. Three, two, one, push. Three, two, one, push. This challenge is underway. Water draining out of everybody's barrel. Everybody's barrel is unlocked and moving. The only rules are your hands and your feet can only touch your barrel. You cannot touch any part of the structure in front of or behind your barrel. <br/>I don't think mine's balanced properly, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Glad you're still around, Jean-Robert. Always need a complainer. <br/>I thought I was the complainer. <br/>Whoa, whoa! This sucks. <br/>Jeff: James struggling a little bit. Denise wobbling just a little bit. bit. Courtney is like a statue. Courtney is like a statue. <br/>Oh, man, I got an itch. None of you guys are itching? Your heads don't itch, anybody? Those mosquito bites from last night. <br/>Shut up. <br/>Bitch. <br/>Jeff: James struggling. Does a good job of recovering. Jean-Robert playing around. And it could cost him and it does. Jean-Robert's the first one out. Take a spot on the bench. Take a spot on the bench. Eight people left. Eight people left. Denise really fighting it, and Denise goes in the swamp. Denise the second person out of the challenge. We are down to seven people left. Immunity on the line. <br/>Whoa. Gotcha. <br/>Jeff: James struggling. <br/>Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Come on. <br/>Jeff: another good save by James. James. It is hot out here. It is hot out here. You've been on your barrels for over 20 minutes now. <br/>Oh, geez. <br/>Jeff: Erik with a nice recovery. Peih-Gee shows the first sign of trouble. Courtney still looking solid. James struggling again. Can he make another recovery? No. James is the third person out of this challenge. <br/>âª Don don don...  Jeff: Take a spot on the bench. We are down to six people left We are down to six people left in this  challenge. in this challenge. Todd starting to struggle a bit now. Erik struggling. Can he get it back? And Erik goes in. Erik is the fourth person out of this challenge. Peih-Gee and Amanda struggling a Peih-Gee and Amanda struggling a bit. bit. Peih-Gee fighting it, and loses the battle. Peih-Gee is the fifth person out Peih-Gee is the fifth person out of this  challenge. of this challenge. Whoa, Amanda, hands off. Amanda's out. Touched the structure. Amanda is the sixth person out of the challenge. We are down to three-- Courtney, Frosti, Todd. All fighting for immunity. <br/>âª Starving artist on the dragon âª  Frosti's singing. <br/>âª Balancing on barrels  âª Balancing on barrels for Jeff  Probst âª for Jeff Probst âª  Jeff: Todd is the seventh person out of this challenge. And then there were two. <br/>Lovers. <br/>Jeff: Courtney and Frosti sitting side by side. Courtney has not moved in 32 minutes. minutes. <br/>I am lazy. <br/>I am lazy. <br/>That sucks. That sucks. That sucks. Oh... no, never mind. Oh... no, never mind. <br/>Jeff: Frosti tries to recover. Can't do it. Frosti's out. Courtney wins immunity! <br/>Thanks, guys. <br/>Jeff: Courtney, come on over. <br/>It's almost like a pageant. <br/>Good job, Courtney. <br/>Jeff: Courtney, you are safe tonight at tribal council. With this around your neck, you cannot be voted out. Courtney has a one in eight shot at a million dollars. For the rest of you, tonight, one of you going home. You have the afternoon to figure out who it's going to be. Grab your stuff, head back to Grab your stuff, head back to camp. camp. camp. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. I did win immunity today. I didn't think I would ever win anything. [ laughs] So I pretty much don't care at this point who gets voted out. I'm immune tonight, so can't get I'm immune tonight, so can't get me. me. Nope. <br/>I was crushed I didn't win it today, because I know I'm next on the chopping  block. I've been really trying to scramble and save my ass, and Denise seemed really  open to the idea of voting with me and my other allies. So hopefully it will get me So hopefully it will get me through one more  tribal council. through one more tribal council. <br/>I thought you were on the chopping block because you were getting votes. <br/>Actually, right now I might not get as many votes. <br/>Things have changed? <br/>I think they... yeah. I... I have the hidden immunity idol. Yeah. Now that I have it, I look like I'm pretty much guaranteed top five for sure  right now. <br/>I was trying to think, how can I keep me in the game longer, and then  Jean-Robert told me he had the idol, and that changed everything. 'Cause I'm 99% positive that James has it. What would you say if I told you I was pretty sure that you didn't have the  right immunity idol? <br/>I'd say that you probably don't have as many clues as I do. <br/>Okay, I'm willing to share with you what I know. <br/>Okay. <br/>James comes over to our camp, and that little block from the archway, we  looked in James' bag archway, we looked in James' bag and there were two of  them. and there were two of them. <br/>But...  Because there's two hidden immunity idols. <br/>There's two hidden immunity idols? <br/>One in each camp. And I'm almost positive James And I'm almost positive James has them. has them. Okay. Hmmm. How sick is that? And this is the guy who is favored to win every challenge from here out. I'll tell what you we can do. I'll tell what you we can do. We'll keep this on the DL. We'll keep this on the DL. <br/>Have you been looking? What have you come up with? <br/>What I came up with is the realization that you're holding out on me. That's what I came up with. <br/>I don't know what the hell you're talking about. <br/>Yes, you do. <br/>No, I don't. <br/>Yes, you do. You had to know I was going to figure it out sooner or later. <br/>Figure what out? <br/>You have two immunity idols. Two of them, and you can't tell your boy? Nobody told me, bro. Who else do you think would figure something out like that except for me? Come on. Okay. <br/>Jean-Robert was just fishing for answers. I don't know what he was trying to pull. He knows I don't like being sequestered or cornered, like he was so cunning  he'd fool me in some way. <br/>Now I'm not even going to ask you anymore. I'm telling you that I already know, and I'm leaving it up to you to decide--  do you want to work with me or are we going on our own? The best course to the end is always going to be with me, not against me. It cannot work up on the well with you if you don't go with me. <br/>I might look like a dumb monkey, and just fall for anything, but I'm really  not. I mean, come on, dude. You're Jean-Robert. You can't trust anything that comes out of your mouth anyway. Why would I align with you? That would be the worst move of Survivorhistory to align with Survivorhistory  to align with that guy. that guy. <br/>James kept playing dumb like he doesn't know what I was talking about, and he  didn't make any kind of offer about what we could do with this advantage  together. Now I feel like it's kind of Now I feel like it's kind of fair game. fair game. fair game. Big, big news. Big, big news. <br/>I know where the idol is, and there's not just one idol. There's two idols. <br/>You're talking about James, right? <br/>He has both idols. <br/>Okay. <br/>How did you know that? <br/>I was just... I've heard hearsay. <br/>He has both idols. Here's the thing-- we could blindside him tonight, because he will not pull  out the idol tonight. tonight. <br/>I know, I know. <br/>I know, I know. Let's see how it goes today. You know, it's really funny-- I had an original idea to take James out, and  then Jean-Robert just came up with the same idea, and I was kind of bothered  by the fact that he's coming up with all these ideas I've had for days now. So I'm always entertaining options. I could change my mind in two minutes. Who knows? This game is fun, and I like This game is fun, and I like keeping it fun. keeping it fun. <br/>He right now has Erik and possibly Peih-Gee and Frosti. That's four. And I'm five. He thinks you're going tonight. I played it up. Like, "Yeah, okay, this sounds like a good idea." But should we do  Jean-Robert But should we do Jean-Robert tonight? tonight? We don't want to tell Denise or no? <br/>No. Denise wavering, and Denise getting pissed off. <br/>I still think we should get rid of Peih-Gee tonight and the Jean-Robert next  time. Todd is all over the place right now. One person comes up to him, he rethinks his whole strategy. He's second-guessing himself. And in this game, you have to be confident about your choices. So I really don't know what's going to happen at this point. <br/>Here's Courtney. <br/>Here's Courtney. <br/>Courtney, come here. <br/>Courtney, come here. <br/>Um... I don't know. I mean... I don't know. I mean... well, I don't... it's up to you guys. I don't give a crap. I'm not entirely sure what happened, but all of a sudden, Todd decided to  vote for Jean[1]Robert. <br/>I think our best bet is Jean- Robert tonight. <br/>It's a widely known fact that Jean-Robert and I have hated each other since  day one. So if everyone's finally willing to vote him out, then great. But he's become the Susan Lucci of tribal council. Like, his name is always up there, but he never quite gets voted out. So I don't have much faith that it will actually happen. <br/>I knew Jean-Robert was going to try something, and I'm just going to have to  deal with it. Hopefully I'll make it through. I don't know if I will take the idols with me, because I shouldn't have to  use them. So I might just roll the dice tonight. As long as I make it to the next one, I should be all right. one, I should be all right. But, I mean, you never know. But, I mean, you never know. <br/>Jeff: I'll now bring in the  Jeff: I'll now bring in the first member of our jury. first member of our jury. Jaime, voted out at the last tribal council. Just remind you the jury is here to observe, not to interact. Courtney, would you have ever guessed that you would be here on day 24  wearing the immunity necklace? <br/>Hell no! [ applause] But if I was going to win a challenge, you better believe it was  one that involved not falling in the swamp. <br/>Jeff: James, this is the second tribal council you've been at without  immunity. You're one of the biggest physical threats in this game. Do you get more concerned with each tribal that maybe tonight is your night? <br/>Yes, I do. I am the biggest physical threat but the far greater threats are the talkers,  the ones who could form alliances easier, that would trade up and switch  around and do all kinds of other stuff. <br/>Jeff: Peih-Gee, if you look at the tribe tonight, you still have a great  number of Fei Long members, and you have you, Frosti, and Erik. <br/>Yeah, Erik and I are the only ones that brought our stuff, so, obviously, I  think we're the only ones who think that we're going home. You know, like, I was devastated losing that challenge today, and it's tough. It's really hard. <br/>Jeff: Jean-Robert, how frustrated would you be if the situation were reversed  and you were sitting in Peih-Gee's or Erik's shoes? <br/>I would be really frustrated, because they're this a really bad position  right now, really bad position. I mean, they've had really bad cards thrown at them. They basically got the deuce- seven off suit in a no limit game. And they've come in a situation, it's pretty much have inevitable. <br/>Jeff: Erik, agree with Jean[1]Robert,  disagree? <br/>It's, of course, tough, but everybody else that's left from Fei Long is going  to realize, like, if I have six people, somebody's at the bottom of that, and  I'm not just saying that to lobby. I'm just saying, like, if I know I'm going to go fifth or sixth, I'm going to  start thinking before that. And I'm not saying that to try and sell people. That is how this game has to work. People are going to have to split. <br/>Jeff: James you're throwing your hands up. <br/>I mean, he's so cute what he says like he's trying to play it up. But I like... I like it. He's beautiful. He's working it. He's working it right now. Already. <br/>Jeff: Jean-Robert, at the last tribal council, Jaime played what she thought  was a hidden immunity idol. How does the notion that there could be a hidden immunity idol change the  game? <br/>When Jaime presented that last week, I thought I was going home. When your job is being the local jerk... [ laughter] ...as the local jerk, I  will probably have my name on a ballot or two maybe three every time. But if somebody happens to place that idol at the right time, that could be  me going home. That's scary. <br/>Jeff: Amanda, is it true that every time you come to tribal you truly believe  it could be you? <br/>Every time you come here, you expect to be going because, anybody could be  doing things that you don't know about. So I don't like coming to tribal council, and I'm not comfortable. I'm not. <br/>Jeff: Okay, Courtney, you have individual immunity. As always, if you want to give it up to somebody else, you can. <br/>No. Screw you guys. <br/>Jeff: Courtney's going to keep it. You cannot vote for Courtney. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Todd, you're up. Todd, you're up. <br/>I hope this is the last time I have to vote for you. I have to vote for you. Maybe we all can sleep now. Maybe we all can sleep now. <br/>Peih-Gee, I'm voting for you.

If I were to relate what happened to a game of poker, I pushed all in and it  didn't work out for me. But I'm playing for first, and the only person who really threatened that  first-place position for me was James. But I think they realized that I probably was the best player in the game,  and they would feel a lot more comfortable with me out lot more comfortable  with me out of the game.
