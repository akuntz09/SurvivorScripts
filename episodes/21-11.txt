<br/> Jeff Probst: This  season's castaways have endured 27 days on the rugged shores of Nicaragua. They have battled exhaustion, starvation, and each other... I'll push you so hard  that damn leg will fly off. <br/>Jeff: ...In their  fight to become the sole Survivor. If you are 40 and older, you're over here. 30 and younger, you're over here. For the first time in Survivorhistory, tribes were divided strictly by age. <br/>The young guns. <br/>I'm young at heart! <br/>Jeff: Pitting young  against old in an epic struggle for dominance. On the La Flor tribe, players weren't afraid to use their youth to their  advantage. <br/>I have always used  flirting and of course I'm going to use that if I have to. <br/>Jeff: And a core  alliance of five was formed... I trust us five, and  that is it. <br/>Jeff: ...Drawing  clear lines within the tribe. The older tribe had wisdom and experience, but not even the presence of super  bowl-winning coach Jimmy Johnson... Team huddle. <br/>All: Espada! <br/>Jeff: ...Could keep  some of the tribe from going over the edge. <br/>She stole my shoes. She stole them. It's a good thing you're not a guy. <br/>It's enjoyable just  to watch a little bit of tension in this tribe. <br/>Jeff: Marty finally  took control at Espada. <br/>Do not mess around  with me. I mean, I'm playing this game for real. <br/>Jeff: But they could  only watch as the young tribe won early and often, slashing the older tribe's  numbers and putting them in serious jeopardy. Having only been to tribal council once, the younger tribe seemed invincible. Drop your buffs. But a surprise switch changed the game dramatically. At the new Espada, older members Holly and Dan joined forces with their new  tribe mates to vote out two of their own. Brenda and Sash reigned over the new La Flor, leaving former Espada puppet  master Marty stripped of his power and his idol. Going into the merge, the younger members had the numbers, and Brenda and Sash  still called the shots. <br/>Marty is not running  the camp. Sash and I are running the camp. <br/>100%. <br/>Jeff: But as new  alliances formed... Serious cracks begin to show in the old La Flor core  alliance. 20 castaways set out on this epic journey. Only nine remain. Tonight... In a special episode of Survivor, we take a deeper look at how the  final nine have survived 27 days of grueling competition. New scenes reveal the conflicts, strategies and power plays that have brought  these nine within days of becoming the sole Survivor. <br/>Jeff: The older Espada  tribe arrived at camp on day one... We did it, guys. <br/>How are you? <br/>Jeff: ...Ready to put  their wisdom and experience to work. <br/>I'll be interested to  see how our older people hold up. <br/>We're the underdog,  the older folks, but I hope we come together enough to where we can surprise  people. <br/>Shelter is the most  important thing right now, guys. <br/>Marty's right,  shelter first. <br/>We need to figure out  where we're going to do it, though. <br/>We stray too far  inside, mosquitoes... There's low tide  right now. You don't want to be too close to the water. [ã    \several talking at onceã    ] As soon as we hit the  beach, everybody starts yacking, yelling, everybody's excited, everybody's  barking orders. We had all chiefs and no indians. <br/>Can I say one thing? There are some palm fronds around here. <br/>Hey, hey. Hold on. I think we collectively agree... There's a lot of  testosterone over there. Tyrone wants to be in control. <br/>Take a one-minute  break here, guys. If the shelter is here... Jimmy johnson's used  to being in a control situation. <br/>If somebody wants to  try and see what it's like to split a bamboo in half, I think it might not be  that... Marty looks like he  wants to be a little bit of a leader, too. So... Let them lead, you know? But give me a couple of good ideas once in a while. <br/>What we need to do  is, we're gonna figure out about how high we're gonna... The power struggle  has begun, man; the game is on. People are trying to act like they know what they're doing in building a  shelter, but... There's one guy that maybe knows a little bit. Joe pesci over there, I think, knows a little bit about construction. <br/>Who the hell ever  built a shelter before? I was born and raised in brooklyn, new york. You think I ever built a shelter? <br/>We're gonna sleep on  that? <br/>Yeah. <br/>We can't just sleep on  that. <br/>No, no, no, no. Five hours, it's daylight left. <br/>Okay. <br/>I'm all for... Watch  it, watch it. And it's a bit entertaining. <br/>We may end up keeping  this roof. <br/>Jimmy t.'s style is,  "Look at me! I crave attention." Guys, listen... I don't feed into that,  'cause it's just like a crying child. Unless their diaper needs to be changed, if you don't respond to that  nonsense, then they'll stop. <br/>I feel like I'm being  ignored by you guys. <br/>We can work while we  talk. <br/>I know you guys are  all saying, what if... One guy grab each... One pole and we lay it up here  and we got our structure. <br/>I heard some rah-rah  with, uh, Jimmy T. And the shelter, there was kind of some yelling going on, couple profanities  as I walked by, but the girls are doing great. And we're weaving palm fronds, we're out gathering wood. The boys have built and un-built the shelter, like, four or five times  already. So I think it's going to be a long night for us. <br/>One, two, three! <br/>Go, go, go, go! <br/>There it is. <br/>All right, that was  good. Are we done? Can I go home? <br/>Jeff: Things were  much more relaxed at the young La Flor tribe... Time to swim? <br/>Jeff: ...Where fun  was priority number one. <br/>Ready, one, two,  three. <br/>Okay. <br/>So I was, like,  "Hi, my name is Brenda. I'm taking down, like, I'm getting in my underwear now." as the younger  tribe we have a huge advantage, because we have so much energy. All of us are fit. And we're all so happy to be here. Underwear! Whoo! Those are cute! And I think the biggest advantage is that we're getting along so well. We're in Nicaragua. <br/>I am really happy  that I'm on the younger tribe. We're not really set in our ways. Like, older people, they're kind of, like... They're already set in their ways. They think that they know everything, and it's gonna be a lot harder for them  to bond and click. <br/>The La Flor tribe  just wants to be in the water, and... I'm with a bunch of idiots. I wish that I had been on the other tribe, because they're a lot smarter. I believe that they had a shelter. I believe they had a door, probably a few windows, a basement and attic,  because I know those women were sitting up there weaving, weaving, weaving. I know it. They do have wisdom. I'm with young idiots. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. <br/>Hey, do you need  another vine? <br/>Not at the moment,  but maybe eventually. <br/>Jeff: By nightfall at  Espada, the tribe had built some camaraderie, along with their shelter. <br/>Tie this one first,  and then I'll put my hand through the top, and you hit the target, all right? <br/>Come on back. <br/>Throw one up here. <br/>Hold on, hold on. <br/>That's good, right? <br/>Thank you, doctor. I got a little upset with some guys earlier. <br/>Oh, here, there's a  bunch right here. <br/>Maybe they just  weren't eloquent in the way they spoke to me. But guess what? I like the way guys are starting to step up. I think we're starting to unite as a team. I think that's important. <br/>Get it in, get it in. <br/>It couldn't get any  better than this. One, two, three... All: Espada! <br/>I'm about ready to  turn in. I'm drunk. But the game plan now is try to get some sleep, 'cause we worked our asses  off today. Everybody worked hard today. Coming in! [ã    \yells in painã    ] You all right? <br/>Yeah. You think that was easy? We got a ramshackle shelter there, but at least it's something we can all  huddle together under and try to get a few hours' rest and make this place a  lot more livable tomorrow. <br/>I mean, what a day  today was, huh? Seriously. So far, so good, man, you know? You just got to be careful; this game changes all the time. It's never what you think it's going to be. [ã    \all yellingã    ] Âª bwah, bwah, bwah,  bwah. <br/>Hey, that sounds so  wrong. <br/>Stew time. -[bumps head] -y... [groans] Fabio needs a bubble  wrapped all around his body. <br/>Jeff: By day four at Espada,  clear roles were established among the tribe... While we got  everybody here, maybe we should have a conversation. <br/>Jeff: ...With Jimmy Johnson  emerging as the group's natural leader. <br/>First of all,  sleeping arrangements, we got to readjust. Jimmy t., he didn't even have a spot last night. <br/>Yeah, we got to just  come up with a plan. <br/>Yeah, so we got to  have a little bit of a plan of rotation. Tonight I'll sleep on that back side. <br/>So I get to spoon  with Danny tonight? <br/>Uh, no, you spoon...  Well, I spooned with Tyrone last night. <br/>Hey, that sounds so  wrong. <br/>But you are my best  spoon, I promise you. <br/>I don't know about  you, but I needed a cigarette when I woke up. [laughter] No wonder I was up  all night. <br/>Jeff: At La Flor, Fabio  came in with a very different strategy-- avoid leadership at all costs. <br/>I came out here with  a game plan. I feel like I'm gonna be able to kind of stay under the radar and slither  through things. I'm just trying to stay cool, stay confident, but not be stupid. Damn it! <br/>Did you rub your eye? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I went and picked hot  chili pepper because our breath was disgusting this morning, and we needed  something to get rid of it. <br/>Oh! <br/>Here, lean your head  back. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, my God, it hurts  to open it so bad. <br/>All right? <br/>Fabio is hilarious. He always gets himself in a sticky situation. He always gets himself hurt somehow. <br/>I touched the seeds  and everything. Will this go away or what? <br/>I think Fabio needs a  bubble wrapped all around his body because no matter what he does to himself,  he's going to get an owie. He's stupid. He's an idiot. <br/>I got to wash my  hands before I touch anything else. Imagine going to the bathroom, touching the chili and then... [laughs]  [groaning] [urinating] I don't know if I'm  accident prone. I mean, things happen out here, yeah. <br/>The yellow are really  hard to pull off. [insects buzzing] Can we even eat these? <br/>Careful, there's a... There's a beehive up  there, too. <br/>There's a beehive up  here? [laughter] Do you see it? <br/>Aah! <br/>Oh! <br/>[screaming] There's, um...  There's all the ants. There's all the ants right inside of it. Maybe that's called accident prone, whatever. <br/>How you guys doing? <br/>Hey, guys. [branch snaps] Ow! Aah! Freaking thorns, man. I don't think people are gonna really see me as I threat. They're going to be, "Well, he's young, he's goofy, and we're not too  worried about him." whoa! Stew time. Yeah... Ow. Yeah, baby. Doesn't that... Doesn't that happen to everybody? I mean, why, not just me, I don't think. [laughs] oh. <br/>Jeff: By day nine,  hunger and fatigue were already taking their toll, and paranoia set in among  the older members at Espada. <br/>I'm gonna throw this  by you. Has anybody made an alliance with you? <br/>No. <br/>Okay, now, listen. There's something that's gonna happen tomorrow at the challenge. That's my guess, okay. I think what's going to happen is, a lot of the city kids, okay, are going to  merge over to this tribe, or they're going to put us with the city kids, and  the country kids are going to come over here. That's why nobody is making alliances. Something is going to happen tomorrow at the challenge. <br/>Holly, I think is a  very nice person, but she's... She's off the deep end. When you hear her talk, you can hear the nervousness. You can see the tension in her eyes. She feels the same stress that I feel. She needs to do well in this game, and she's not, and now she's hitting the  panic buttons. I'm worried that you're overthinking it, and just... Right now, you seem...  You still seem a little edgy. <br/>No, that's because  that's how I am. I think about things, and-and, uh... I know, but it's  gonna end up... It's gonna eat... Starting in here, it's eating at you, and  it's coming right up... I know, I'll drink a  lot of water. Listen, um... The strategy part-- I am not going to lie-- I struggle with the  strategy part. What's her name? Oh, God, I'm terrible at names. And that's one thing I didn't think I would struggle with coming into the  game, because I thought I maybe overanalyzed it even before I started, but,  hopefully, it won't get me at the end. So don't worry. <br/>Oh, I appreciate you  coming and sharing it with me. <br/>Okay. <br/>'cause I... It sounds  like it's a possibility. <br/>I think it's a very  good possibility. <br/>Pretty strong  possibility. <br/>Okay. [thunder crashing] Jeff: Things weren't  much better at La Flor, where severe weather conditions tested the resolve of  the entire tribe. <br/>I hope this rain  stops, man. Gee, it sucks so bad, man. <br/>I'm just so  frustrated. It's the rain and just being, like, wet and cold. I haven't really been, like, warm. Like, every night, I've been freezing. But everyone else is putting up with it. I don't understand why it's so hard for me. If I want to go home, if I just want it to be over, they're going to think...  Oh. They're just going to think I'm, like, super weak. It's killing me out here. I just want to quit. 24 hours of this... If you can go through  this, you can go through anything. This rain is hideous. It can break you down, and it reveals your true character. Just like a game, it's ten percent physical and 90% mental. So, if I have to be that girl's rock to keep her protected, then I'll do that. Purple kelly is an important number for our alliance. And we're going to carry her as far as we can. <br/>Wow. The river's flooding into the ocean. We had quite the rainstorm, but we're in the middle of the rainforest, so,  what did you expect? Look at this. This is all about to crack right here and go in. Watch this. Watch this piece. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Kelly purple is a  huge waste of space. She bitches and moans about anything and everything. <br/>This is sad to me. <br/>She's definitely  involved with Brenda's alliance, and I think it's time for her to go home. <br/>Jeff: At Espada, Jimmy  Johnson became the first casualty of the leadership battle. Jimmy, the tribe has spoken. But the war was far from over. [rolling thunder] [crashing thunder] with Jimmy Johnson gone, the remaining  men at Espada angled to fill the leadership vacuum. <br/>Actually, we're doing  pretty good. Yeah, it's a good fire. I've had a plan since I arrived and started playing this game, and my game  has finally arrived. As much as you can ever say anything in this game, and you can't ever be  overly cocky, but I'm in control finally. I'm in control of this tribe. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Hey, man, we should  move this fire a little further away, 'cause these flames-- all we need is a  wind, and it's gonna catch the wood pile, and then, it will catch on to the  shelter, and then we've got problems. <br/>It's not gonna catch. <br/>Huh? <br/>It's definitely not  catching. <br/>Hey, you know what? I'm going to slide this over, man, 'cause... It won't hurt to slide it over. <br/>Uh-oh. <br/>I'm not trying to  impede on your situation, but I'm just telling you from experience. I've seen it. That's kind of what I do for a living. You hear me? <br/>Yeah, he's a fireman,  I get it. But he felt that we were in a Danger zone and that too much of the wood that  I had nearby was going to catch fire and blah, blah, blah. And, like, come on, man. I mean, I know what the guy is all about. He likes to hear himself speak. He needs to feel that people are listening to him as he asserts himself. What are you saying? <br/>Why take a chance,  and this light up, and then, the whole shelter...? <br/>You can be mad if you  want, but I'm going to push the fire away, 'cause I'm not sleeping in the  rain any more than I already have. I think Marty is probably not used to taking a back seat. And I think his little-- whatever-- ego, his little pride or whatever, got in  the way. He blew a little hissy fit and stormed off like a little girl. When I was talking about the fire, and I said we probably need to move it  over, um, and you said, "Well, don't ... The thing all up." Well... Now, but if...  No, I'm just saying. <br/>Well, when you pulled  the whole fire that I'd been carefully constructing and everything else, you  got to give some consideration into the time, effort and work that I was  putting into it. <br/>I'm giving you all  that. I'm giving you all of that. But I'm just telling you, there's a way to talk to me, 'cause I talk to you  with respect, and I felt like you were disrespectful, and if you come at me  disrespectful again, it's gonna... I'm gonna do the same, and it's gonna be  ugly. <br/>Now you're throwing a  real heavy, I'm disrespectful to you, when all I said was, "Don't ...  With my whole fire." I mean, come on, man. Don't you think that's a little exaggerating? <br/>Okay. <br/>And then... And now  you just gave me, like, a defcon five warning, basically saying, "Marty,  don't you ever be disrespectful to me again." and I don't know what. Some kind of a threat in there or something. You know, I don't respond well to that, you know? <br/>And it... "Hey, man, don't  push me that way." you know, I'm not gonna tolerate being pushed that  way, either. You know, like, "Don't tell me I'm wrong." or "Don't tell me...  Don't threaten me, don't..." you know, that's... Now you've stepped too  far. <br/>Here's where I...  Here's I thought... Let's get it done, Tyrone. I thought we've moved on. Like men, I thought we had moved on. <br/>Whatever you want to  do, but we're playing the game. I came to you right now, and I knew it wasn't going to be an easy  conversation for you or me, so move... When you threaten  somebody, it usually isn't. <br/>No, if I was  threatening, you'd know it. If I was, trust me, game or no game. <br/>I would just love to  be able to throw down tonight and just have him see, "Dude, here it is. "Okay, like, wake up, dude. Wake up and smell the roses." guess who's going to be the number one  target? <br/>Jane-- I don't know  where her loyalties will lie. <br/>Beg, borrow, steal,  whatever I've got to do. I'm going to try to win a million dollars. <br/>Do you know where Jane  is? <br/>I want to work with  you to the end game. <br/>Yup. I do kind of believe Sash right now. <br/>He'd be one of the  easiest to beat at the end for a million dollars. <br/>Jeff: After a  surprise tribe switch on day 12, former Espada members were suddenly  outnumbered at the new La Flor and had to scramble to prove their worth. <br/>From miami. <br/>Oh, okay. <br/>Uh, st. Louis, missouri. <br/>My position when I  was on Espada was totally solid. Now, coming here, um, there's five of them, three of the older tribe. My position is not so good. <br/>Wow. <br/>I like you. <br/>Fire lady, honey! <br/>You fish, right? <br/>I fish. <br/>Jane, I don't know  where her loyalties will lie. I think she may be bonding with them. She's the most skilled person out here. I call her "Survivor macgYver" because she can do anything, she  gets fish, she gets crab, she has boundless energy. And it's hard to argue against a full belly. So I'm very worried that Jane's ability to bring in food for the camp is  going to be what sends Marty and I home. <br/>One of my strategies  right there is, I'm just trying to be the provider out here. Trying to come in this game as fully prepared as I can. I mean, I started... Kind of like restricting my food a couple of months ago,  just in case I got on the show, so that I wouldn't feel all the hunger pains. Not only that, I bought me a sauna, and I started sitting in it up to 170  degrees so the heat doesn't bother me. I think that paid off. So, hopefully... Fingers crossed, we'll get fish today. It worked! Whoo! I'm starving. I want me a fish. I'm gonna eat this one I just caught. Every now and then, the provider needs a meal. [ã    \laughsã    ] well, just too late in the day, not  enough heat in the sun. I'm gonna go get me a burning stick out of the fire and see if I can sneak it  down here. <br/>I was just trying to  divert attention away from the campfire so it won't look suspicious, because  I really want to steal fire embers. <br/>Yeah, I can do that. <br/>Somebody ought to go  help her. <br/>Some of them jumped  out. <br/>Oh, they did. <br/>They did. Run help her. So, everybody that knows me knows me that I'm a very honest person. How I play this game has nothing at all to do with my real life. I'm out to win a million dollars. Beg, borrow, steal, whatever I got to do, I'm gonna try to win a million  dollars. <br/>Do you know where Jane  is? <br/>Oh, this is gonna be  so good. I got me a meal. And it's in my stomach, not theirs. [ã    \laughsã    ] Jeff: On the new Espada  tribe, the addition of four young members forced the older tribe mates to  rethink their strategies. <br/>Who's here from our  team, from our old tribe? Me, you, Tyrone, and who else? <br/>Yve. <br/>Yve. Right. Yeah. I don't see anybody beating us. <br/>I don't, either. <br/>No, because you  picked the cream of the crop. <br/>Thanks, Dan. <br/>Well, it's true. Brand-new game, brand-new people. As far as strategy, uh, I'm probably... I'm probably super vulnerable here. I mean, I'm the oldest guy by far. Whenever I get in front of the mirror next time, I'll be pulling hair out of  my ears and shaving my beard off. But I think I'm gonna let it go salt and pepper now. As long as it's not all salt. <br/>It's pretty long. <br/>Yeah, look at his  roots. <br/>Yay! <br/>Let's see your hair. <br/>It looks like a wig. <br/>Sit up, let us see it. <br/>It does. [laughter] Oh, my God, Dan! <br/>Oh, no way! Leave it. <br/>I have a major  strategy now. I'm trying to make new friends, yeah. I'm trying to get in with them and, um... You know, I'm trying... I'm trying  to get into the crowd. I'm a competitive guy. I don't want to lose it. The kids like me, you know. But who knows, I could be screwed tonight. They may be playing a game with me and I'm gone. <br/>Show up at the  challenge like that tomorrow. <br/>It will be so  intimidating. <br/>Yeah, just do it. <br/>Mohawk! <br/>Dan is hilarious, and  he's totally valuable. He's valuable because he's weak. His position is the number, and that's why we need him. Because he's an easy number because he knows that he's weak and he's happy  that we keep him around, so he's gonna be loyal to us. <br/>There you go. <br/>See there with a new  hairdo. <br/>That's amazing. <br/>Aah! [laughter] [birds squawking] Jeff: By day 16 at  the new La Flor, Marty's grip on the game and his idol were weakened, while  save began a power move to become the game's new puppet master. <br/>So I was just curious  to have you just walk me through what the thinking was so I can understand  what the thinking was, and... No, there's no doubt  that... You having the idol... Yeah? <br/>...Makes, you know,  some people nervous. <br/>It's absolutely  ridiculous for me to do any kind of move or try to leverage that idol  pre-merge. At this point in time, I'm not controlling this game. I'm no longer in the driver's seat. So I'm along for the ride. That's the best that I can do right now. <br/>I think with everyone  here on La Flor, I think you may be one of the only people that may have a  50-50 shot of winning at the end. I'm telling you this to try and... Right. <br/>...You know, to tell  you what my thoughts are. 'cause I'm not just thinking merge. I'm thinking also... Yeah, clearly. <br/>...Long term. <br/>Sash is a pretty  smart player. And when he laid out his plans for me, I was, you know, further impressed  with the way that he's thinking about this game. But you can't be cocky or over-confident in this game, but I do kind of  believe Sash right now. <br/>I want to work with  you to the end game. <br/>Yup. <br/>So, let's get far  together, and... I'm all for it, man. <br/>There is a little bit  of truth to what I said to Marty about going to the end. I think of everyone at La Flor right now, he'd be one of the easiest to beat  at the end for a million dollars. If we have each other's backs, then, why not go to the end? <br/>For sure. <br/>But I've been making  end agreements with everyone. I think it would be great if we just kind of watched out for each other's  backs. You know, I would think that we're top four? I'd love to... Get all the way to end with you. <br/>Thanks, Sash. <br/>I want to make a safe  pact with every single member of La Flor to guarantee me a final spot in the  end. I see us moving-- you and I personally-- moving much further along in the  game together. <br/>Just love to. Love to do it, man. <br/>Saying that you want  someone to be next to you at final tribal council and promising it are two  different things. Come final tribal council, they'll be in for a rude awakening. I think we could really dominate this game. <br/>I think so, too, man. <br/>You really screwed up. <br/>Mm. <br/>Whoever did it,  something should happen to them. To them or their family. <br/>Chase and Jane,  they're tight, but I don't think he's smart enough Or, like, bold enough  to make a move. <br/>Right. <br/>I just hope Brenda  ain't playing y'all for a fool. <br/>Jeff: On day 19, La  Flor moved over to the Espada camp, and the two tribes became one. [indistinct, overlapping chatter] Libertad. <br/>Lift it up. [all gasping] Oh, my God! <br/>[screaming] Rum! <br/>No. <br/>Rum. Yeah! <br/>Jeff: But the  celebration didn't last long. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Old alliances  were immediately tested, and new partnerships were formed when NaOnka  committed the ultimate crime-- stealing food. <br/>I saw her put the  flour in the bag. And I couldn't understand why. I should have confronted her right away, and I didn't. <br/>They're so stupid. <br/>Hey, where's the  flour? <br/>Naonka, did you put  the flour back in the chest after you used...? <br/>Everybody saw me put  it in there. If you didn't see me, then you didn't see me, but I put it in there. <br/>We're just... That doesn't just get  swept away by the tide, you guys. Like... No, I think it's  pretty obvious somebody stole it. <br/>Yeah, this is obvious. <br/>Whoever did it,  something should happen to them. To them or their family. <br/>They should go home. <br/>This is how I feel. <br/>Yeah. <br/>This is ... Stealing  food. <br/>When you have a  guilty conscience, you have to say something, you can't live with it. So she came to me, and she didn't know what she should do. <br/>Are you going to go  back and say something? <br/>No. What am I going to say? <br/>I just don't want you  to. <br/>So how are you going  to get out of this situation? <br/>Yeah, I'm just gonna  put it out there, and I'm not gonna say anything else. <br/>So, you're gonna put  it all in a pile and just set it back here? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Well, nay, as a mom,  okay? <br/>Yeah. <br/>The only thing I can  tell you is, when you do something wrong, it's better to confess and say  you're sorry. You're going to get way farther in life. So, that's the only advice I can give you. Okay? <br/>Okay. I don't know, something about Holly. She kind of reminds me of my mom, and I respect her. It helps me out a lot, and I would like to have Holly here for as long as we  could have her here, until she's... Not valuable anymore. <br/>Why did you tell me? <br/>'cause I love you. That's why. And it took a lot for me to say it, 'cause I ... Up. <br/>It's okay. <br/>I really ... Up. <br/>I feel really bad. <br/>Thank you. <br/>It's okay. We all make mistakes. <br/>Okay. <br/>My mothering  instincts are definitely kicking in with these kids, and it kind of helps  because she look at me as, like, a mom figure, so, you know, I definitely  have her on my side. <br/>I'll start it off. Earlier this morning, after we made the tortillas, I did put everything back  in there. I did grab the flour. And my purpose for grabbing the flour was to measure it out to put half and  half because we were using a whole lot of food, okay? <br/>I don't think it's  strange to see a young woman go nutso. If it happens to a woman, you expect it. I am somewhat of a chauvinist. You know, that's that brooklyn attitude. If one of the guys had done that, I would have told him to just get the ...  Out of here and don't come back. That's for sure. Let's go get it and bring it here. <br/>And so, you know it  was here. You don't remember? You don't... Well, I just said I don't  remember. <br/>How do you not  remember? <br/>I just need a moment  so I can, just, like, look. <br/>Naonka obviously  wasn't thinking straight, you know, and for her to do something like this. It's, like, I just hope she goes home soon. And that... It'd would be fine. <br/>It's so immature. I am so pissed off at NaOnka. She is way too emotional to have as a core alliance. It really made me question her intelligence and really where her focus is on  the game. She might not be the best person to go to the end with. Where's the flour? It's at a tree? <br/>It's a tree over  here, there's an arrow going to it, and I've been looking for it. <br/>You don't remember  what tree? <br/>No. <br/>Okay, there's an  arrow on the ground. <br/>Yeah, I made an arrow  with sticks. <br/>You really screwed up. <br/>Mm. <br/>You've just got to  trust 100% that our alliance is still strong. We still need you. You still need us. <br/>Yeah. <br/>So let's go. I was just shocked that NaOnka would do something so stupid. Like, you're in a perfect alliance, you've got everything going for us, and  you're going to go put a target on your back which hurts our alliance. Like, come NaOnka. Stop being so stupid. It could be right here. Here it is. <br/>Where was it? <br/>It has not been  opened since this morning. <br/>We got it. <br/>We got it. <br/>We found it. <br/>Where was it? <br/>Over there. <br/>At that tree. <br/>You really... You  mistaked over there for right here? <br/>Yes, I did, but I  have to... We got to get her out  now. Um, I like her... Well, I don't want to say that. <br/>Jeff: With NaOnka's  flour scandal behind them, the tribe took time away from the game to let  their hair down. <br/>Âª and he's always  my very best friend âª âª I'm standing here just too months past âª âª  and I'm talking to his stone... Âª singing and songwriting for me is therapy. I started writing songs about a month and a half after my dad died. Âª oh, it must have been God's way... Âª I think that was the first time,  you know, I've shared some of my music with my tribe mates. I'm just trying to be the guy that everyone kind of likes and try to get  along with everyone. Âª he was my hero âª dad you were... Larger than life. Âª Chase's song about  his dad got me super emotional. Singing, and you know, music always has all these emotions, and I thought no  one could see me, but, um, I started to tear up a bit just-just thinking  about... Just the whole thing. Just so many emotions. <br/>[humming] That's all. <br/>[ã    \applauseã    ] Oh, that was great. <br/>But I just have to  remind myself to stay focused on the game. <br/>My life will never be  the same, ever again. <br/>Anybody who wants to  really play this game and win this game has to do so without emotions. <br/>Chase is super  emotional. He's not thinking about the game. He's just trying to be nice, which is great, good for you. But that's not going to make you win. So you go home feeling like a great guy, but you will go home without a  million dollars, and someone else will, which is fine for me. <br/>Jeff: By day 27,  power couple Sash and Brenda were in complete control of the tribe. <br/>I know you're working  your magic, just like I am... Exactly. <br/>...With all the guys  and everything else. <br/>Exactly. <br/>So, you know, I'm not  worried about it. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>But, you know, not  everyone is as smart as we are, either. <br/>So, um... Mm-hmm. <br/>I know all the guys  like you, you know. Chase is definitely on the outs with them. You know, they would much rather have you on our side. <br/>I'm on whichever side  is more convenient for us. <br/>For us to get to the  end. Brenda and I believe that we're the two smartest people in the game. Both she and I have almost cast a special spell over pretty much everyone in  the tribe. So Brenda and I have the power to send whoever we want home. I'm, you know, telling all these people, saying, "Oh, yeah, final  three." but you're really the only one that I care about going to the  end with, and whoever our third is... Doesn't matter. <br/>...Is, whoever, so... Well, but it can't be  Chase. <br/>Brenda and I are in  the driver's seat. However, we both understand that we're probably the biggest threats for the  million dollars at the end. So, although we're conspiring together to make it to the end, I don't know if  we both will. <br/>My only concern right  now is, um, Chase and Jane. They're tight. But I don't think he's smart enough, or, like, bold enough to make a move. <br/>Jeff: Brenda and Sash's  arrogance would prove to be a serious blind spot in their strategy. They were about to discover the limits of their power. <br/>I know. <br/>I don't want to sit  here and vote something against you. <br/>I know Brenda is  wanting to get me out. I think... I just... We can get her out. When we want is the only thing. <br/>Chase and Fabio  grabbed me, and they're, like, "Well, I just don't think it's a good  idea to vote Brenda out." and I'm looking at him, like, "Sucker! What have they done to you?!" you're a hell of a dude, and I'm telling  you, you've got a great brain up there. I'm trying to make inroads with Fabio to open his eyes up how Brenda is just  going to use him like a pawn, because she's a black widow. But Fabio can't see it, Chase can't see it, because she has her magic powers  over these young men, and they're falling for it. <br/>I don't think that's  the best thing to do, man. <br/>I really don't. <br/>Who do you think? <br/>Hmm? <br/>Who? <br/>Sash. I don't think they're gonna let you get too close. <br/>See, I like Sash. <br/>I think Sash is the  biggest threat around here. Sash don't want to take me or you, probably, to the final three. He don't want to do that. 'cause he knows you or I will win. <br/>Like, I would rather  her go sooner than later. Like, Sash and then her, and then, you know, Holly and everybody is still  around, all the nice people. <br/>'cause we're good. I just don't want to see evil win. <br/>I feel good that, you  know, we pulled you aside and talked to you. <br/>Okay. <br/>Are you trusting me  right now? <br/>Yeah, I trust you. I mean, I do. I just hope Brenda ain't playing y'all for a fool. <br/>I don't want to vote Brenda  out. I don't think she's lied to me. And it's... It sucks right notice, but... At some point in the game, you've  got to chop the neck of the person that you might be closest with, and if  that gets me further in the game, I'm going to have to do it. <br/>Jeff: At tribal  council, Chase broke rank from his old alliance and sided with his new ally, Jane. The black widow Brenda was voted out in a landslide. Brenda, the tribe has spoken. Only nine castaways are left. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: The end is in  sight. <br/>What?! <br/>Jeff: But the closer  they get... Just straight up lied  to me and you both. <br/>Jeff: ...The harder  it becomes. <br/>He talks too much. He's paranoid. <br/>Jeff: Strategy  intensifies. <br/>Can you swear on your  mom that you will not backstab me? <br/>Jeff: Conflict  escalates. <br/>I want to see that ...  Walk out with his torch down. <br/>Jeff: Who will outwit  the cutthroat competition? <br/>If we stay a strong  four, we dominate. <br/>Jeff: Who will  outplay in grueling challenges? Fabio fighting for the lead. [groaning] who will outlast the extreme conditions? [thunder rolling] Jeff: Who will become  the sole Survivor? <br/>And then the rest of  the game is smooth sailing. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for  scenes from our next episode. [thunderclaps] Jeff: Next week on an  all-new Survivor... Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: As the storms  get stronger... It's like class-three  rapids. <br/>Jeff: ...Naonka gets  weaker. <br/>As it rains and it  pours, it makes me feel like crap. <br/>Jeff: And Purple  Kelly finally has something to say. <br/>I just don't know,  like, physically, how much longer I can put up with this. <br/>Fish, fish. <br/>All right. <br/>[laughter] It's the fish Dance. <br/>Fish Dance. <br/>Oh! <br/>Fish Dance. <br/>It's the fish Dance. <br/>Unbelievable.
