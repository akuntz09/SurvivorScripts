<br/>(roaring) (trumpeting) (roaring)  (growls) * (hooting)  Jeff Probst: This is Gabon, one of the last untouched places on the planet. * 18 Americans have been flown across the world and dropped here in the wild  with nothing but their street clothes. They're being led to one of the most remote places in Africa. They come from different walks of life. <br/>I am a 2004 Olympic gold medalist in the women's 4 x 400- meter relay. I'm gonna use my blazing speed to win the hell out of this game. <br/>In the wintertime, I teach high school physics, In the summertime, I lobster,  do commercial fishing. <br/>I wasn't the best kid. As a teenager and stuff, I was doing some things I'm not proud of, but you  know, I'm grown now, and I can't believe that I actually have a chance to win  a million dollars. <br/>I'm from America, but I grew up, very well, going to different countries,  flying on Concorde and being in the best hotels, Swiss money. <br/>Probst: Forced to work together, they must create a new society while  battling the elements and each other. <br/>This is Earth's last Eden and I can see why. It's untouched land, and it's amazing. <br/>Probst: They must learn to adapt or they'll be voted out. In the end, only one will remain to claim the million-dollar prize. <br/>It's completely awesome to be thrown into the world that is about to start. It was just like, okay, here we go. <br/>Probst: 39 days, 18 people, one survivor. (theme song playing) Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION  * (trumpeting) Probst: Welcome to Survivor: Gabon: Earth's Last Eden. You guys ready to get started? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>You know it. <br/>Probst: First thing I want you to do is introduce yourself and say what you  do. <br/>What's up, everybody? My name is Danny. I'm a maintenance supervisor. <br/>I'm Runaround Bob. I'm a physics teacher. <br/>My name is Jacquie, and I do medical device sales. <br/>My name is Ken. I'm a professional video-game player and a college student. I'm number one in the world at video games. I'm a huge time strategist, but I am very shy, and in the game of Survivor, I  am the underdog. <br/>Hey, everybody, I'm Marcus. I'm in the medical field. Good to see you, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Good to see you. <br/>Hi, I'm Charlie. I'm a management consultant. <br/>Matty. I'm a personal trainer. <br/>Hi, Jeff. I'm Jesusita Smith. Everybody calls me "Susie." I am a part-time hairdresser and I'm a  mom and a wife. <br/>Hi, my name is Paloma. I'm a student and I'm a server. <br/>My name's Randy, and I am a videographer. I edit wedding videos for a living, but I'm not the most positive person in  the world. I'm not a big fan of marriage. I will never get married myself. I'm almost sure of it. <br/>Hello, Jeff. My name's Ace, and I'm a photographer. <br/>Hi, everyone, my name is Crystal, and I'm a preschool teacher and a full-time  mom. Even though I am an Olympic gold medalist in track and field, I have no  intention on telling anyone what my real occupation is. <br/>My name's Kelly. I'm an assistant manager and buyer for one of the high-end retail stores in  Chicago. <br/>Hi, everybody. I'm Corinne and I do pharmaceutical sales. I'm going to be a total bitch and I'm gonna get rid of who I have to get rid  of and I'm gonna hurt people's feelings and I'm gonna laugh when people cry  and I'm gonna own it. <br/>I'm Dan, and for five years I was an attorney, and I'm currently finding  myself. <br/>Probst: You're gonna have 39 days to find yourself out here, if you're lucky. Woman in the purple. <br/>Michelle. Hi. AKA "woman in the purple." Um, I work in film. I help music supervisors and editors. <br/>I'm Sugar, and I'm a retro pin-up model. <br/>I'm Gillian, and I'm a wife, a mother, a grandmother of four, and I'm a nurse. <br/>Probst: Okay, in Gabon it is tradition that the elders typically make the big  decisions and are the leaders. In keeping with that tradition, I need the two oldest people. <br/>Bob? I'm gray enough to be old. <br/>Probst: Okay. <br/>I'm 57. <br/>All right, looking good, Bob, looking good. <br/>Probst: Nobody can beat 57. All right, Bob, and it's Gillian? <br/>Gillian. <br/>Probst: Take a spot on the mat, either one. You guys figure it out. Red or yellow. <br/>You want that? <br/>Probst: You guys all right with those choices? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right, we're going to choose tribes. (gasps) Each time you make a selection, you can choose a man or a woman. It doesn't matter. Obviously, these are big decisions. You are forming your tribe, and you're going off very little information. A name and what somebody says they do, if that is what they do. (chuckles) Rock, paper, scissor to see who chooses first. <br/>Okay, ready, one, two, three? Got her. <br/>Probst: Paper covers rock. Bob will choose first. And how it will work is you will make the first choice, then you will choose. Then the person who was chosen will make the next choice. These are individual decisions. All right, Bob, your first choice of who you want on your tribe. <br/>I'm bad at names. Can I take Baldy? (laughter)  Probst: The guy with shaved head. You want to tell him your name? <br/>Thanks, Bob. It's Ace. <br/>Nice to be able to talk to you. <br/>I'm going to talk to you today. <br/>The woman that was standing next to Ace. <br/>My name is Crystal. <br/>Hey, Crystal. Come on over. <br/>Ace, it's now your choice. <br/>I don't think it would be appropriate for a photographer not to have a model. Sugar, please. <br/>Yes. (contestants chuckle)  Awesome. <br/>Probst: Sugar joins Ace and Bob. Crystal, your choice. <br/>Suzanne, come on home. <br/>I knew it. <br/>You know, mamas gotta hang together. <br/>That's right. (both laugh)  Okay, now we're playing Stupid Survivor because this makes zero sense. Like, she clearly is not an athletic person. I'm so confused. Like, don't you want to win immunity? <br/>Probst: All right, interesting so far. <br/>Go, moms. <br/>Uh, the tall farmer-looking boy. (laughter)  Hey, I'm Marcus. <br/>Marcus, welcome aboard. <br/>I'm going to go for the surfer dude. He looks beefy strong. <br/>Matty. <br/>Hey, Matty. <br/>Come on down, Matty! <br/>We need some strength, Ace. <br/>Probst: What do you think, Matty? You like this tribe? <br/>Yeah. (all laugh)  Like he has a choice. <br/>I got three moms. <br/>That's right. <br/>Probst: All right, Marcus, your choice. <br/>I'll take the guy in the suit. <br/>I'm Charlie. <br/>Probst: Charlie's happy. <br/>Hi! <br/>I'm gonna go with the guy in the flowered shirt. <br/>Randy. <br/>Probst: Randy. <br/>Palomo. <br/>Paloma. <br/>Paloma. Come on down. <br/>That's cool. <br/>We gotta have a tie on our team. Come on. Dan, Dan. Nice to meet you. <br/>My lady, Kelly. <br/>Yay! <br/>I'm taking the young Jay-Z there on the end. <br/>Hey, my name is Danny, by the way, but you can call me G-Sizzle or GC. <br/>I'm gonna take the other blond. I think we need three blonds. <br/>Probst: Three people left. GC, it's your choice. <br/>I'm gonna pick the big homey with all the game right there. I don't know your name. <br/>Oh, my name is Ken. <br/>Ken, my bad. All right, Ken. <br/>Come on over, Ken. <br/>Probst: Two choices left. Jacquie, who do you want on your tribe? <br/>The girl in the suit. <br/>Corinne. <br/>Probst: Corinne joins the yellow tribe. <br/>Welcome, Corinne. <br/>Probst: Gotta ask you, Michelle, last one chosen. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: What does it feel like? <br/>I'll learn to love you guys, maybe. <br/>We'll take another hot girl over here. That's fine. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! Yeah! <br/>Finally! <br/>Probst: All right, we have our two tribes. Red tribe, you are Fang. Here are your buffs. Yellow, you are Kota. <br/>Kota! <br/>Probst: All right, guys, ready to get to your first challenge? On my go, you're going to race through the flags to the top of the hill,  where you will find two individual immunity idols, one for each tribe. The first person from each tribe to get to the top of the hill and grab the  idol will be safe at the first Tribal Council. Also waiting for you at the top of the hill are the essentials that you're  gonna start with, including a bag of rice. There is one more twist to this challenge. Also waiting at the top of the hill is an extra bag of corn and beans. The first entire tribe to get all of their members across the black line wins  the corn and beans. Do you race out ahead selfishly and get that idol for yourself or do you work  together, thus ensuring food? I'll see you at the top. Survivors ready? Go! What are they gonna do? (women laughing) GC's out in front. Gillian bringing up the rear. Fang quickly falling behind. Matty and Dan now going back to help their tribe. <br/>Gotta get 'em on the hill. Gotta get 'em on the hill. <br/>Probst: GC first to the hill. <br/>Come on, guys. Almost there. Keep pushing. <br/>Probst: GC and Marcus looking out for themselves, going after that individual  immunity. Big move to make early in the game. <br/>Come on. Keep it going. Keep it going. (Paloma grunts)  Probst: Bob helping out Paloma for Kota. Ace pushing her. Marcus first to the top. Marcus has the idol for Kota. Here comes GC for Fang. Michelle right on his tail. The rest of Fang lagging behind. For Fang, GC grabs the idol. Michelle, the last woman picked, is the first woman across. <br/>Really don't think the Fang tribe really is that smart. I was the last one picked, and I was the first girl up there, so they can  kiss my ass. <br/>Probst: Big question now: which tribe gets the food? <br/>Oh. <br/>Come on, girl. <br/>Come on, Kota! Let's go! Come on, guys. <br/>Probst: Kota with a big lead heading for that food. <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>Let's go. Let's go. <br/>Probst: Susie, Gillian, Crystal really struggling for Fang. This isn't even close. Everybody got to be across the black line. (Gillian grunts) (applause)  We got it. <br/>Probst: Kota wins the extra food! Bag of corn and beans. Matty just trying to get his tribe to the top. <br/>I think we're screwed in a lot of physical challenges because Gillian is  going to be a huge, huge, huge load to carry. She's a slow-moving human being. <br/>Sorry. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I know I can run. But climbing that hill was so hard. I had on a dress, and on top of that, my two shoes weigh at least ten pounds. <br/>That's it. That's it, Gillian. <br/>Good job. Come on, girl. Almost, you're almost finished. <br/>Probst: Fang finally crosses the finish line. All right, so Marcus has the idol for Kota. GC got the idol for Fang. Kota was the first tribe to get everybody to the top. You win the extra bag of corn and beans. (applause)  Probst: I got to say, Fang, if this is any indicator, it's going to be a long  run for you guys. That wasn't even close. All right, Fang, grab your stuff, including the map, to your new tribe home. All right, Kota, grab all your stuff, including that very important extra bag  of food and head out. (elephant trumpeting) (monkey squawking)  Being this far out in nature in the middle of this huge jungle is definitely  an unnerving experience. (monkey squawking) You don't know what's around the next tree. It's really, really scary. We emerged from the jungle and we look down and we see the flag for Kota  waving in the breeze. There's this beautiful lake, and in front of it are a couple of broken-down  huts. (applause) It was such a joy to see that there was some shelter kind of  established. <br/>It's crazy. <br/>It's a wild, wild place, and you don't want to be out there exposed to  animals. I mean, the rest of the tribe could be sitting there and we could be getting  eaten by a leopard and no one would know the difference. <br/>We have the canoe. <br/>We have a dock. That's awesome. <br/>I love it. I'm excited. This place looks beautiful. (laughs) But there's really wild animals out here. (laughs) This is really Africa. So I'm not going to get in the water right now, and I'm not going to be  bathing or swimming in the lake with my tribe mates. (laughs)  Hey, we need to work on the roof. <br/>It's about to rain. <br/>I'm feeling sprinkles. <br/>Okay, let's pass these out now. <br/>We got to layer it up. <br/>Okay, okay. <br/>We're pretty solid. <br/>Do you need more twine? <br/>Just give me a piece, like, a foot long. <br/>Ugh, Bob-- he's just like the forever Boy Scout. <br/>Go, Bob. Go, Bob. Let's give him some moral support. <br/>Bob, he's totally like, he gets it together. He's got the camp running really smoothly. <br/>Yeah, it's looking really good, man. <br/>He's 57 years old, and he's awesome. <br/>Good job, guys. (applause)  Whoo! <br/>I've done a lot of stuff around camp. To me, it's common sense. I come from Maine. You know, that's what we do in Maine. <br/>...exactly together. <br/>...actually use a short piece of something. <br/>It's actually turning out to be a nice-looking bench. <br/>This is the coolest stuff. <br/>You're the coolest, Bob. <br/>I don't like to spend money on stuff, so I tinker. If I don't know how to do it, I go to the library and get the book, look it  up and go do it. I'm going to make something like this when I get home. <br/>Bob, at what point are we going to eat? (laughter)  Oh, yeah? Oh, great. We got some huts to begin with. Awesome. <br/>This will work. <br/>This will work. Yeah, all right, so, apparently, according to some people, we sucked today. I don't think so. I thought we were awesome. And I think that's what we need to do is we've just got to keep that awesome  spirit going. There's an African word for "fierce." It's... bucale! (all chattering)  I don't know if I believe you on that. <br/>All right. (cheering) I always try and maintain a positive attitude, and I just hope  that our tribe, the Fang tribe, will stay positive. This is cool. Hey, this is awesome. And maybe they'll forget I was the old broad that fell up the hill. (laughs) Hey, you guys, if anybody finds any elephant dung, bring it back. It burns well. <br/>We've been here 20 minutes and she wants elephant ...  Oh, elephant dung. <br/>Oh. <br/>Isn't that interesting? Obviously, one has to be wary. There are elephants around because there was elephant dung that we walked  over. But let's hope that they just keep their distance. And if we can get fire going, it will certainly keep animals from coming  around the camp. So you want to see the elephant dung? <br/>Not really. <br/>It's very interesting. Look. <br/>You want to see my dung? It's interesting, too. <br/>They poop out the seeds that they don't digest. And we were wondering, maybe there might be something edible inside still. <br/>Oh, don't even think about that. <br/>This is our first day, and I've come to the conclusion that Gillian is  annoying. <br/>You can. You can squeeze elephant dung and drink it. <br/>She is so busy at just trying to look busy, and she's not accomplishing crap. <br/>You know, here. <br/>I know. <br/>Kick it open. <br/>They're in there. You want, you want to be the first to try a termite? <br/>You don't have to cook them, right? You can just eat them. <br/>You just eat them. I found a queen one. This is a lot of protein. As a professional gamer, there is a stereotype that, you know, you're  antisocial, you're a nerd, and you sit in your basement all the time. And of course, I mean, girls don't dig that. Are you going to eat it? Are you really going to eat it? It'll be hot if do you that. Everything that... You ate it? How'd it taste? <br/>I don't know. I just swallowed it. <br/>You got some protein. <br/>I just ate a termite. <br/>That was hot. <br/>My God, I just ate a termite! (laughs)  Back home, I am very shy with the girls that I like. Last girl I kissed was actually in high school. That was, like, four, five years ago, which is a long time. That was the queen termite. That wasn't any ordinary termite. <br/>I know, you gave me something special there. Like, seriously...  Yeah, that was my gift to you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>But being here in Gabon with a girl that, you know, you are attracted to is a  very special moment in life. I mean, I am single, and she is single. You never know. A romance could start. <br/>It tasted like chocolate. (Ken mutters)  We've got the cantinas right now. Why don't we try and do all the other stuff, get a great camp, and then we'll  work on getting the water and fire. <br/>Um, just from personal need, where are we going to put the latrines? <br/>Do you guys want us to dig, like, a three-foot, like, thing? <br/>No, not a deep hole. <br/>So then what are we doing? Does everybody individually dig their own hole, poop, and then cover it up? <br/>The Roman legions used to do it... The latrine moves. So we cut down, we cut down a foot, and then we cover it up. And when it's completely flat again, we move the latrine. I don't want to punish you guys. I mean, I'll go do it. <br/>I don't mind doing the latrine. I'm just confused on how to do it. <br/>I'm the full package. I'm not just a physical competitor. I'm a mental competitor. I have no fear of being the sole survivor. I have no fear of standing in front of Jeff and expecting my check for a  million dollars. What I've done at the moment is give suggestions, let other people carry them  out, take some of the benefit, and then they go, "But you know who  suggested that, right? Ace." Why don't we go into two groups and get some really dry wood and  try and do the fire thing? <br/>Ace, he's like charismatic, and I think he has a plan. Like, he's here to play hard. I think the best strategy right now is to just lay low. <br/>Our best bet is probably to, like, let Ace run the show for a while. My prediction is Ace is going to get obnoxious. Like, let's sort of let him, if he can, dig his own grave for a while. <br/>People say you don't need friends here, but if you can find a friend or  someone you trust, I think that's, like, it means a lot. And, like, I was like, I'll either be playing this game alone or find someone  who I have a connection with. I feel that I have a special bond with Marcus. Ever since I saw him on the mat and he picked me, I just felt this connection  in his deep, blue, beautiful eyes. <br/>Do you think I had any doubt that you're a well-balanced human being-- like,  I wouldn't be talking to you like this if I did, so...  Okay, cool. All right. It feels good to, like, trust one person at least. <br/>Yeah. The thing with Charlie is I think he's attracted to me. But, you know, I'll be honest. Like, I don't see any romance with Charlie and I. I think he's a great guy. You know, I can see that he's handsome and smart and all those things, and I  really can appreciate that about him, um, but it's not really the way I roll. <br/>You're a nice guy, and you know it. <br/>Yeah, I'm chill, that's all. I'm straight, so we're in Eden, but there's no two Adams here. (both chuckle) (trumpeting)  Don't they have more bears than...  Shh, there it is! There it is. <br/>You guys hear that? <br/>What is that? <br/>Sounds like something calling. (trumpeting)  There it was again. (elephant trumpeting)  The animals are starting to lurk around camp. There's an elephant 30 yards from our house, just cruising through the forest  right behind our little huts, so it's a little bit frightening. (elephant trumpeting)  Shh, shh, shh. (rustling)  Ow! <br/>Oh, no! <br/>I think I have a small scratch. <br/>See it? <br/>Holy crap. <br/>I was walking back to camp and I was kneeling down to get into our little  house and I hit my head on a sharp branch. The second I hit my head, I felt the blood running down my face. I don't know how bad it is. All I know is it's bleeding a hell of a lot. Nurse, do you know anything about scratches? <br/>Well, hmm. Sorry, can't see a thing. <br/>It was totally dark around here. <br/>There I am, this nurse in the dark. A real clinical challenge for me and everybody's looking at me like I'm going  to be able to do something about it. Yeah, right. <br/>Right. <br/>At the risk of being like a mother, you've got to really take care of  yourself out here. Just be careful; otherwise, you're going to get hurt. So, we've called the medical to come and take a look at it. <br/>You can use that anesthesia any time you want. A .22 gauge needle. It's going to sting, Randy. <br/>Break up the monotony of our first night here. <br/>You'll feel a sharp sting. My suspicion is you're going to need a few stitches there. <br/>Just a couple? <br/>Yeah, yeah. You okay? <br/>The cut is smarting a little bit. No need to stop; just go for it. <br/>Yeah, get it done. All right? <br/>Just so I stay in the game. I can live with the scar. I couldn't see it. I don't have eyes on the top of my head. I didn't know if it was three stitches or 30 stitches. I knew it was bleeding a lot. But leaving this game is not an option. And I am petrified that this injury could take me out of the game. (trumpeting)  You hungry? Man, we've got some good food. <br/>Yeah, we got some...  Like what? <br/>Grasshoppers and crickets and...  Eww. <br/>Who wants them? <br/>You might want them. <br/>I'm full. (laughter) Last night, I cut my head. The doctors were great. I think it only took, like, two or three stitches. I don't know. And they put this huge bandage on it. But it's better today than it was yesterday, which means it will be fine in a  couple days. <br/>I'm supposed to be on the frigging equator. Where the hell is the sun? Seriously, like, I'm just freezing. <br/>Look at her. She's miserable. <br/>Think you'll be...  It's really, really, really cold at night. And I'm really bony, so I'm sleeping bone on wood, and I don't have any,  like, cushion, so nights are definitely the hardest. <br/>You got some fire? <br/>No. <br/>Bone is pretty hard, isn't it? <br/>Not hard enough to create spark. <br/>No. <br/>You don't think? I don't think that's going to work. <br/>Trying to make fire with a bone. I don't think I got stuck with the brightest bunch, that's for sure. I just kind of keep thinking "Why did I get stuck with all these people  and the other team's got all, like, these smart, beautiful people, and I'm  stuck with these dorks?"  Where is the tree mail? There it is. Our first tree mail. <br/>Let's bring it back. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Let's bring it back to camp. <br/>Okay, let's do it. <br/>Okay. "You've had a cold, dark night in the jungle, and your situation is  feeling dire. Wouldn't you love some security and a nice, big roaring fire? <br/>Yeah! <br/>"Well, you'd better move together for a chance to win the flame. If you're not the first to finish, you may be the first to leave the  game."  All right, so we're going to do a little combined meditation. So, focus on something. Hands up. Going into this challenge, I wanted us all to be, like, really in sync, so I  felt a little yoga would really sort of clean out our humors, get our energy  flowing; the chakras would be all in tine. And just get us excited and motivated for this next challenge. Just breathe into it if you feel any sort of shudder. (snickers)  I should be stretching too. (laughing)  Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Definitely. <br/>Probst: All right, for today's challenge, six tribe members will be belted  together. You will race through a swamp, over a net wall, under and over a series of  hitching posts. You'll then dig up three bags of puzzle pieces... and make your way to the  finish where the three remaining tribe members will use those pieces to solve  the puzzle. First tribe to solve the puzzle wins. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Immunity. <br/>Immunity! <br/>Probst: This is the most important thing in this game. When you have immunity, you cannot be voted out. Without it, you are vulnerable. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Winning tribe wins immunity and fire in the form of flint. (cheering)  Yeah! <br/>Probst: Losers go to Tribal Council, where somebody will be the first person  voted out of this game. Going to give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right, so it's Paloma, Sugar, and Bob solving the puzzle for Kota. For Fang, it is Susie, Gillian, and Randy. For immunity and fire, survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, Kota! <br/>Go! <br/>First leg is through a leech-filled swamp. <br/>Kota! Kota! <br/>Neck and neck through the swamp. <br/>Kota! <br/>Push it! Push it! <br/>Probst: Kota with a bit of a lead. <br/>Go! <br/>Go, Kota! <br/>Go on! Keep moving it! <br/>Probst: Go! Keep it moving! Everybody's got to get over! Corrine and Kelly are stuck. <br/>Go, go, go, go! <br/>Probst: Fang now in the lead! <br/>Yeah, let's go, Fang! <br/>Good job, guys! <br/>Probst: Got to go under, then over. Fang at the lead at the crawl-under. Kota right behind. <br/>Go, Fang! <br/>Probst: Do not slow down here. Fire and immunity. You don't want to go to Tribal Council. <br/>You got it! You made it! Go! <br/>Probst: Fang still with the lead! <br/>Come on, Kota! <br/>Probst: Looking for three bags of puzzle pieces. Got a friendly exchange of dirt going on. It's not a playground. Million-dollar game. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Two more, two more. <br/>Come on! <br/>Probst: Kota has their first bag of puzzle pieces. <br/>Come on, y'all. We got to get some fire for real. <br/>Keep digging! <br/>I got a bag. It's here. Come on. <br/>Probst: Fang finds their first bag. <br/>You got to pull it out. Pull it out! <br/>Probst: Just got to get it out of the dirt. Kota has their second bag of puzzle pieces. Fang still trying to get that first bag out. Kota looking for one more bag before they move on. Kota has their third and final bag of puzzle pieces. They're heading out. Fang still trying to find the remaining two bags. Exhaustion is setting in. <br/>Come on, guys. Help us. <br/>Let's go, guys. <br/>Try and get the sand off. Don't throw it back in. <br/>Probst: Let's go, Fang. Keep digging! You're still in it! (cheering)  Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Get on the mat! Go! Start solving it. <br/>I teach physics, so I was all excited to do the puzzle. It's like working in the classroom. <br/>Probst: Solve it one bag at a time, one puzzle at a time. <br/>Come on, Fang! You're not out of it yet! <br/>Got it! Got it! Got it! <br/>Come on, guys, right here. <br/>Probst: Kota has the first third of their puzzle solved. Two bags left. <br/>You're fine! Keep going! <br/>Okay, these two go together. <br/>Kota on their last part of the puzzle now. This challenge is an absolute blowout at this point. <br/>Dig fast! Dig! <br/>Probst: It might be time to put it in the deep freeze, Gillian. You might be out of it. <br/>Nothing's gone till it's gone. <br/>I'm really tired of that accent. I understand "never quit", but dude, we lost. <br/>Come on, guys! Keep going! It's not over till it's over! <br/>Fang, let's go! Come on! <br/>You're okay! <br/>Probst: Fang coming around the corner, but it's too late. Kota wins immunity and fire! (cheering)  Boy, that was brutal. <br/>Probst: All right, well, so far, three days in, this is not even close. Two absolute blowouts. Kota, congratulations. (cheering)  Yeah! <br/>Probst: Immunity, nobody going home tonight. Also, the other half, fire in the form of flint. Fang, the only thing I have for you is a date with me tonight at Tribal  Council, where one of you will be going home tonight. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. (trumpeting)  Good job, you guys. <br/>We did not get destroyed. <br/>All right, awesome. <br/>And we are not unorganized. <br/>We were winning till the third quarter. <br/>Okay, guys. <br/>We lost another challenge. We could have had fire tonight, and most importantly, we could have kept our  tribe together. <br/>We need somebody, and none of us want to do it, step up and say, "I'm  leader."  I'm the only one who is not worried about getting voted off because I did win  that first immunity challenge. And it feels good, but at the same time, there is nobody stepped up as a  leader of the tribe. So, we got to have some kind of game plan. <br/>What are you hearing, anything? <br/>Yeah, Michelle. <br/>Why is our team better without Michelle? <br/>Because right now we're...  I'm not arguing with you. <br/>...we're in a down-and-out position; we need positivity. She's negative; she doesn't want to be here; she's miserable. <br/>I'm up in the air. I'll do whatever. <br/>Michelle. <br/>Michelle. Michelle. <br/>That's a good reason...  You know what, you do what you think you got to do. That's who I'm gonna go with. <br/>That's who I'm going for. As of now, I'm voting Michelle. <br/>Just let me know where you're at-- I'm there. <br/>Me, too. <br/>Are you guys feeling me or no? Randy, you look like you're not feeling me good. <br/>It's early. I'm-I'm... I hear you. <br/>It's not that early. <br/>If I believed that Michelle was getting five, six, seven, eight votes  tonight, I'd have no problem voting for her. It's just, I don't buy it yet. <br/>Hot. <br/>Get out of the sun, then. <br/>I would prefer Gillian to go tonight, just because... she's a 60-year-old  woman. Nothing against the 60-year-old women out there, but don't come to my camp. <br/>You guys were great. You just had to dig differently, and that's all. <br/>I didn't think about that. <br/>So just because it seems like we're disorganized, I don't think any of us  think we are. <br/>She cheerleads and blows sunshine, thinking they're gonna like her, but, to  be honest, Gillian is worthless, totally worthless. <br/>So, who's leaving tonight? <br/>I really want to... want to vote out Gillian. <br/>That's what I was thinking. She's the oldest and would slow us down the most. <br/>Gillian is our weakest member, like, in everything, and we do need physical  players right now. Like, she's a nice lady, but I don't think she's meant for this game. I don't know how everybody else is gonna vote. I think you're on the outs right now. <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah. I mean, we're the...  That's so funny 'cause that would just, like, confirm my belief in this tribe  that they're, like, the dumbest people on earth. <br/>You don't talk to anybody besides me, so they do think...  They're all retarded. Like...  I know. I would really rather keep Michelle in this tribe because I really do like  Michelle, and I really do think that she would be allies with me. <br/>It's hard for me to pretend to like people that... really frustrate me. <br/>I seriously don't know what's gonna go on at Tribal Council tonight. I think it's gonna be a mixed vote. <br/>She's Negative Nancy. <br/>And there will be no hesitation in me tonight to vote Michelle off for that  whole reason. <br/>Me, neither. <br/>She's-she's sad. She just doesn't need to be here. I personally had absolutely no qualms about myself voting for Michelle. I'm sorry, but I think Michelle needs to go home, for her sake and for our  sake. She's just having too hard a time, and it's not good for all of us. Bad vibes is just not a good thing to have around. I might be the naive woman that's just walking around thinking, "Tra-la,  it's not me, thank God," um, but it may be. Uh, I doubt it, though. I really feel Michelle just doesn't want to be here. *  Probst: Behind each of you is a torch. Grab a torch, approach a flame, dip it in, and get fire. This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council because in this game, fire  represents your life. As long as you have fire, you are still in the game. When your fire's gone, so are you. That will be the case for one of you tonight. Well, let's just get right into it. Dan, let me ask you how you guys think you did at today's immunity challenge. <br/>I think we did okay. I think we did... I think we did better than we expected. <br/>Probst: You think you did okay. <br/>I do. <br/>Probst: So in addition to being a complete disaster, this tribe is in total  denial. <br/>I disagree. I don't think it was a complete and utter disaster. I think we can take those guys, and, uh, we're looking forward to the next  challenge. <br/>PROBST (chuckles): 'Kay. Michelle, give me the play-by-play. You were in there. What was going on? <br/>Well, it took a long time, and there were people taking breaks. Uh, Ken was taking a break. G-Sizzle resting on his bag digging with one hand. <br/>I'm-I'm sorry. I got tired. I mean, I got exhausted, so, yeah, I took a break. If that was the reason we lost, I'm sorry, but, I mean...  Well, it wasn't the reason we won 'cause we're sitting here. <br/>You can't go a hundred percent, a hundred percent of the time. <br/>Um, that's what a challenge is, that's what a race is. You don't stop till the job is done. <br/>Oh, for Pete's sake, then why didn't you step up at that point and just get  right on it? <br/>I didn't stop digging. <br/>But you should've verbalized it. You should've said, "Hey, will you do this?"  That's what I was doing. "Come on, y'all, hustle!"  All right, all right, you're right. (several talking at once)  There was a barrier there, so we could not see you guys. <br/>I just thought it's common sense that, you know, when we're in a race that  you don't stop until we're done or we win. <br/>Probst: Well, I'll tell you what I just saw. I asked a simple question, and immediately you guys went into arguing about  something else. So, Crystal, who's leading this tribe? <br/>Right now, at this current moment, we don't have a distinct leader. It's frustrating. <br/>Probst: Gillian, you started picking this tribe. Are you happy with the fact that you still don't have any leadership? <br/>I think there are plenty leaders in the group, but I think that a lot of  people feel like it's kind of the death knell to... to come out as the leader. <br/>Probst: Anybody willing to step up and say, "I think I could help us  avoid coming to Tribal Council"? Anybody willing? <br/>I think it would be a good idea if we had someone who we all looked up to and  said, "You could definitely be the leader of our tribe," but since  none of us have that feeling toward...  I think you could. <br/>I happen to think you could, too. <br/>I think it needs to be discussed. (several talking at once)  As long as they're open to the eight other soldiers' opinions or strategies,  I think you got a great style. <br/>I appreciate you guys saying that, but maybe I don't have the courage to be  the leader because I don't want to lead you in the wrong direction and have  you upset with me for... for making that decision. But if I was volunteered, I'll take it. If they want me to roll with it, I mean, I'll do it. <br/>Probst: GC's willing to be the leader. Who's in favor of that? <br/>I didn't say that, either. I said if they wanted me to...  Probst: GC is open to being the leader if you would like him to be. <br/>I'll give you the answer now. Yes, I would vote for GC to be the leader. <br/>Probst: Randy. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Probst: Gillian, you all right with GC? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: How about you, Michelle? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Ken. <br/>He would be the best candidate. <br/>Probst: How about you, Susie? <br/>I'm good with that. <br/>Probst: Matty? <br/>I'm fine with that. <br/>Probst: We accomplished something big. I'm impressed. Fang has a leader, and his name is GC. Good. Let's talk about relationships. Michelle, who are you closest to out here? <br/>Probably... Ken. We're both the youngest, and we were both the last picked. I like talking to him the most. <br/>Probst: How much does it weigh on you that you were the last person picked? <br/>I kind of wasn't surprised, but I think that in the first challenge, I proved  myself very worthy of being in any tribe, and I definitely think there's some  deadweight that we could throw off the boat that would make us a little  stronger, a little faster. <br/>Probst: Gillian, on the flip side, you struggled in that first challenge. <br/>Well, I saw the challenge, and I thought, "I'm dead." Yeah, it  sucked, and I was. I'm the old bag that had to be helped up by two young bucks up the hill. But, you guys, thank you. But I hope that everybody's been able to see that there's actually more to me  than just the gray hair and the old woman that sucked on the hill. <br/>Probst: All right, it's time to get to the vote. GC, you have the immunity necklace. As always, you can give it to somebody else if you want to or keep it for  yourself. <br/>I'm going to go ahead and rock this for tonight. I'll roll with it. <br/>Probst: You cannot vote for GC. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. Matty, you're up. *  I think you're the weakest on this tribe. That's pretty much it. *  I don't think you want to be here. And with your whole attitude about everything, I don't think you should be. *  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. * Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Counsel area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Michelle. Gillian. One vote Michelle; one vote Gillian. Michelle. Two votes Michelle; one vote Gillian. Michelle. Three votes Michelle; one vote Gillian. Michelle. That's four votes Michelle; one vote Gillian. First person voted out of Survivor: Gabon: Michelle. That's five; that's enough. Need to bring me your torch. * Michelle, the Tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. * Well, you came in here as a group of individuals. It seems like you found the necessary leadership to leave here as a tribe. More good news: you'll be taking your torches with you back to camp, which  means you will have fire. (cheering)  Thank you, God! <br/>Probst: Here's your flint. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. <br/>Thank you, Jeff! <br/>Probst: Good night. <br/>We're gonna eat some rice! * (trumpeting)  Ow! Baby! Oh, yeah. Another day in Gabon. Michelle's gone. Oh, man, that was rough. We had our first Tribal Council tonight, and it sucked. We lost Michelle, and we were lucky enough to get flint tonight. <br/>So Kenny, you want to do the honors? Or how are you feeling? <br/>Me? I can do the fire if you want. <br/>Yes, I think you should do the fire. Yeah, he should do it. <br/>And there should be no pressure, but as our leader, you miss fire, and you're  getting voted out. <br/>Tonight, to my surprise, my tribe picked me to be the leader of the tribe. It kind of feels good that people want me to be the leader of the tribe, but  at the same time, I feel like I'm going to have a bigger target on my back  just because of that title. <br/>There it is. Don't stop! Got it. Okay, don't stop. Keep it going. Yep, fire, fire, fire! <br/>It's going good. Throw it over. <br/>GC is the hero. <br/>Team captain once again. <br/>It feels good tonight just knowing that I'm the one who got the fire started  and my tribe is now able to eat and we're gonna be warm. <br/>He's excited. He's got fire. <br/>It's sparking right now. It's cracking. The fire is cracking. I'm feeling good. (theme song playing) Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION  *  Today, things are going fairly well. I think the tribe settled down a lot after the, the great victory we had  yesterday, and we're kind of doing the daily chores. <br/>I love our team. Our team rocks! (laughter)  Rice pudding? Oh, thank you. Very nice. <br/>Marcus is, like, my favorite person out here. He's funny. He's smart. He's athletic. He's, like, the whole package. And I can't understand why a million girls aren't jumping all over him  because I certainly would be if I could. <br/>And away we go. (bird cooing) We have a lot to talk about, I think. I can't stress enough how safe I feel because I have you because when you go  off, like, I do get this, like, pang of (gasps), you know? And, like, when I see that you're there, it's like even though I'm not there,  like, I feel like, I'm there in spirit, and I'm, like, yeah, like, someone's  gonna back me up if I'm, like, knocked down. Our alliance is, like, clearly... I just can't imagine there being a stronger  one. <br/>I think you just have to see how every day it stacks up and gets stronger and  stronger. I kind of have this inner circle bond with Charlie. I look at it like layers of an onion. And I think Charlie's the guy that's sort of the innermost layer, then we're  adding people as we go along. I, I talked to Jacquie a little bit, you know? She seems like a really cool girl. And I am totally psyched 'cause I know she likes you. Like, I think Jacquie might get along. <br/>I think at this point, it's looking like the large onion alliance, as I might  call it: myself, Charlie, Jacquie, Corinne, is what we're shooting for. Jacquie is an awesome girl and I think she's also very intelligent. And I think Corinne is probably the smartest one around. <br/>I think the best way to strategize with her is to get to know her as a  person, like...  Yeah. I'm gonna talk to Corinne and kind of get a vibe for her 'cause no one's  really made any official pitch at this point. (buzzing)  If we're going to go look for some fruit or something, I think it'll be best  to do it before it gets too hot. Susie and Crystal, would y'all mind getting fruit? Fruit. Yeah, Matty, maybe you and Randy could find stuff that we could use maybe as  spoons or bowls or something. <br/>Okay. <br/>You know, you get sticks, kind of like, like, uh...  Shape 'em. <br/>Yeah, shape 'em and mix foods. <br/>Kenny, if you want to just, man, grass or anything, just stuff we might could  use for a good layer. Being the leader right now, I think, is working out okay. I'm just trying to get this camp put together. I'm a maintenance supervisor, you know, and it's my job to build things and  get them put together. I'm like, man, let's just get this thing together and let's get this ball  rolling. <br/>If you guys want the best bedding, we'd have to weave. <br/>At least put down a layer of grass, and whatever you're talking about  weaving, we can put on top of that. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>So that way, at night we're all comfortable. <br/>I guess I can weave all day. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>All right, you ready? <br/>Yeah. So far, the ideas that I present to 'em they think are pretty good, so we've  got a plan for the day. <br/>We're gonna have to change out this water. <br/>This is rice water. <br/>Actually, do you mind if I try to make it? <br/>What, the rice? <br/>Yeah... if you don't mind. <br/>No, of course not. <br/>If, if you're all ready, I'll start it now. <br/>Yeah, tha-that's what I was doing. Just wing it. If you get too much water, we just cook it longer and...  Okay. <br/>GC, you use lake water. All we have up there is clean water. It's boiled. <br/>Anything wrong with using clean water? <br/>Yeah, to make rice you got to boil it again, and that doesn't make sense. Boil it once and use lake water. <br/>What do you mean we have to boil it twice? It's already boiled. It's just water. Do you understand what I'm saying? <br/>I understand what you're saying, but you're doing the work twice. <br/>It's just water, Randy. We're surrounded by water, bro. <br/>I get you. <br/>Our tribe has a leader-- GC-- but he's too young and he doesn't know squat  about any of this, and my new operation is called Operation Let Other People  Crash and Burn. <br/>Didn't you want us to go get fruit? <br/>We're going to get leaves for the bed. <br/>What's happening? What's cracking? Ain't nobody moving. <br/>My best plan right now is just to keep my mouth shut, sit on my ass, and  watch us self-destruct. <br/>The king is restless this morning. (monkeys squealing)  I only talked to Jacquie. <br/>Oh, really? <br/>For me, at least, I'm only putting my-- I trust Jacquie wholeheartedly. She's like my girl, and I trust you. <br/>I like hanging out with you, and, like, I think it would be great to have,  like, a smaller layer of the group. <br/>Yeah, I think we have a really good chance. I would like the alliance to be, like, me, you, and Jacquie, tight, strong,  Charlie, and then just have, like, one, like, like, loser person. <br/>I think things are kind of naturally just going the right direction. <br/>Originally when I came in, I really liked Jacquie and I really liked Marcus  and also Charlie 'cause I feel like they're really trustworthy. I know that that's only four and that leaves five out, but that's a  short-term thing. And then we just need a peripheral one extra person to be in the majority,  and Bob is really benign. Like, everyone likes him. <br/>I think Bob's the best, right? <br/>Right. <br/>Bob is our chance. If we can convince Bob that going with Ace is not the right way to go, then,  like...  I can bring Bob in, like, full-on bring him in. <br/>Better situation. <br/>The only, only problem is I don't want to give him too much information. <br/>When Corinne, Marcus, Jacquie, and I were out in the forest, it was the first  time we ever talked strategy as a foursome. <br/>If they see us all going off, they're probably gonna be like-- everyone is  going to get nervous. <br/>What should we do? This is bad business. Let's go back. <br/>It was like magic. It was like one brain working as one. It was amazing. I really think we're on the same page here. * (snoring)  Well, I think the morning started some time when the moon was right above us. GC had got up earlier. I heard this washing machine going, doing lots of, you know, the slushy,  slushy, slushy washing machine noises and stuff like that. And I thought: just keep it down so we can all sleep. Otherwise we're going to be killed. <br/>Damn, I'm sweating like crazy. <br/>I'm sweating like mad, too. <br/>And then a second person joined him, and then the talking started and more  talking, and more talking, and then Susie joined them, and then that got even  louder. (laughter)  Dude, you are the king of snoring. <br/>Gillian was letting it out last night. <br/>Was she? <br/>I have, I have a request. I'm going to voice my opinion. We have all day to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Perhaps we could just keep it down for certain times during the night. <br/>I'm sorry, Gill, but I was, I was woke up, like, early this morning because  five people were in there snoring. <br/>Yeah, I...  All right? So I got up as quietly as I could. If other people come out and start talking, don't come out to me and say...  I didn't say...  It felt like, it felt like when you came out, you were saying Danny, uh...  If I wanted to attack you, I would have said, "Danny, quit flapping your  gums at night."  I'm a grown man. Ain't nobody gonna tell me when I can do something and when I can't. <br/>Do you see I didn't tell you what to do? <br/>I'm just telling you. <br/>I just asked. I just put in a request-- could we keep the blah, blah, blah down. <br/>We don't need a damn leader. I'm younger than all y'all, so what I'm being the leader for? I didn't want to be a leader, I'm not gonna let y'all force me to be the  leader. So I'm not going to. <br/>GC, which stands for "golden child," resigned as leader, which was  probably the best leadership call he's made since he's been leader because he  hasn't led anything. <br/>So, Dan, if you want to step up, here's your chance. Randy, you want to step up? I mean, you guys say-- if that's what you want, somebody here, somebody  else's chance. And if nobody says nothing, then that means we don't need a leader because  obviously nobody wants to be a leader. <br/>He's a leader who quit, who quit this morning. It was just the complete opposite reaction that you would want from any kind  of leader. <br/>If you want to be the leader, man, I'm telling you...  I-I don't necessarily think my management style would-would be good for this  tribe. I-I personally don't. So I-I prefer not to. Everyone's got their own management style, you know. I-I know I-I'm highly emotional. So I'm not sure my-my management style would be any better. I would like to be a silent leader. The silent leader is never the one that gets the blame, but he gets to lead,  so that would be a great direction. <br/>We got mail. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Hey! <br/>Okay, listen, listen, listen. <br/>"A rolling stone gathers no moss, and losers are just left wishing. One tribe will have to vote someone out, the other one will soon be  fishing."  We got tree mail this morning, and I definitely think we have a chance of  winning, but we'd have a much better chance if we were more unified. (indistinct chatter)  Oh, there it is. <br/>Nice. <br/>There it is. <br/>I had the idea of painting people's faces with charcoal, and that seemed to  bring the mood up a little bit. <br/>Yeah, this is my "go to war" face. I'm about to tear it up! <br/>Oh, that's good. <br/>I'm gonna kick your ass! (laughter) (elephant trumpeting)  Probst: Come on in, guys. Kota getting your first look at the new Fang tribe. Michelle voted out at the last Tribal Council. What's with the face paint? Gillian? <br/>Unification. <br/>United tribe coming to take them on, and, uh, do it. <br/>Probst: Guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>ALL: Yeah. <br/>Probst: First things first. I will take back the immunity idol. Thank you, Marcus. <br/>See you in a bit. (scattered laughter)  Probst: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, on my go, both tribes will push a large boulder  through a series of gates. Along the way, you must retrieve two sets of three keys. When you reach the final gate, you'll use those keys to open three locks,  then race to the finish. First tribe to the finish with their boulder securely on their pedestal wins  immunity and reward. Want to know what you're playing for on that end? (all voicing assent)  Probst: Here's your reward. Fishing gear. (applause)  Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Everything you need to fish. You have hooks, line, netting. You have worms. Traps. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: And a spear. <br/>Oh, we get the business. <br/>Probst: In addition, the winning tribe will choose one person from the losing  tribe to go to Exile Island. Good news, bad news about Exile. Bad news is, when you're away, things happen at camp. You never want to be away from camp. Good news-- waiting for you at Exile Island-- the first clue to the location  of a hidden immunity idol. If you have immunity as a tribe or as an individual, you cannot be voted out  of this game. Worth playing for? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Kota, you have one extra member. Gonna have to sit somebody out. Who is it going to be? <br/>Me. <br/>Probst: All right, Paloma, take a seat on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. Here we go. For immunity and reward, Survivors ready? Go. <br/>Push. Push more! Get on the side! Get on the side. <br/>Susie, Susie. <br/>Probst: These hills are steep. You're going to have to dig deep. That ball is heavy. <br/>Gillian, get out of the way so somebody else can push. <br/>Probst: Kota with a bit of a lead. Fang right behind, no thanks to Gillian. Let's go. <br/>And then get around it. <br/>Probst: Kota-- first to their first set of keys. Fang slowing down right before they get there. <br/>Hold it. Hold it. <br/>Probst: Bob working the knots for Kota. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Okay, if you stabilize this. <br/>Probst: Head up top for Fang. <br/>Go, Ken! <br/>Come on...  Probst: Bob has the keys for Kota. They're heading out. (woman whoops)  Go, Ken. <br/>Probst: Ken has the keys for Fang. They're heading out. <br/>Guys! <br/>Yeah! <br/>How's it going? Let's get it over here. <br/>Not too much push. <br/>Get there...  Let's go. <br/>Probst: Kota still with a bit of a lead heading down the hill. (indistinct chatter) (boulders banging) Major collision between Kota and Fang. <br/>Aah! <br/>Lucky key. <br/>Go, go, go, go, go! <br/>Got the key. <br/>Probst: We are dead even at the second set of keys. <br/>Up. <br/>Okay, you can do it. <br/>Good job, Bob. <br/>Good job, Bob. Don't look at anybody but yourself. <br/>Let's go, Ken. <br/>Probst: Ken working the knots for Fang. Bob once again flying through the knots for Kota. <br/>Go. <br/>Go! <br/>Probst: Kota again is out first. <br/>Nice, Bob. <br/>Nice, Bob. <br/>Come on, dude. <br/>Probst: Fang right behind. We've got a race. <br/>Go. <br/>Straight. Right, right, right. <br/>We got it, guys. <br/>Come on. Give it all, you guys. <br/>Come on. <br/>Go, go. (overlapping chatter)  Come on! <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Yeah, go... go. <br/>Probst: Kota first to the final gate. (mumbling)  Probst: Fang now working on their locks. <br/>Come on. Let's go. <br/>Probst: You have six keys, but only three locks. The question is, how lucky are you? <br/>Wrong keys. <br/>Go, go, go. Where's the second set? <br/>Mine's good. <br/>Probst: Kota has their first lock undone. Fang has their first lock. Kota has their second lock. Fang now has their second lock undone. <br/>Yes, go! <br/>Probst: Kota has their third lock. <br/>Hold it! Hold it! Go, go, go, go! <br/>Probst: Kota racing to the finish. Fang has their third lock undone. It's a race to the finish. <br/>Come on. Let's go. <br/>Keep going. Huh? <br/>Get ready. Get on, Charlie. Go around the other side. <br/>Don't stop. Push up. <br/>Probst: Kota, got to get the ball on the pedestal in order to win. <br/>Push! <br/>Put it up! <br/>Go! Everybody on the back side! <br/>Probst: Fang racing to the end. They've still got a shot. <br/>Let's get it. <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Push. <br/>Roll it back a little bit. Roll it back a little bit. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Come on. <br/>Good going. <br/>Go! (grunting)  You're done. <br/>Probst: Kota wins immunity and reward. <br/>Yay! (panting)  Much different from the last challenge, guys. You were right there. <br/>Good job, y'all. It's all right. It's all right. (grunting)  Probst: Congratulations, Kota. Immunity once again is yours. In addition, fishing supply. Now you have a big decision to make. Who from the tribe of Fang do you want to send to Exile Island? (whispering)  Yup. Dan. <br/>Probst: Dan. Going to Exile Island. Get your stuff. Straight down, hang a left. You'll know when to use the map. You will return in time for your next Tribal Council. Fang, once again, you have a date with me at Tribal Council tomorrow night,  where the second person will be voted out of this game. Grab your stuff, head back to camp, and we'll see you at Tribal tomorrow. Kota, congratulations. Grab your fishing gear. * (laughing)  I was so excited when we won the fishing gear for our reward. We are by far the stronger team in that we've won three challenges, and we  just are getting stronger and stronger because of the rewards that we win. <br/>So what do we do first? Celebrate first? <br/>Hakuna matata. * (humming)  Whoa. <br/>I sort of expected the worst out here. This is 10,000 times better than my normal life at home. Like, I'm having a blast out here. Like, this is totally fun. <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>Ooh, real fishing gear. <br/>Our morale is up. Everybody's, like, all about teamwork, and we have, like, the most clever  guys possible. They already know how to, like, put the net out. We have all of our fishing lines going. <br/>All right, Marcus! (cheering)  Oh, my God. <br/>Whoo! <br/>We're doing really well. I don't envision us losing ever. (giggles) *  Fang lost a challenge and the winning team got to send one of the losing  tribe members to Exile Island. I don't think it's a smart move for Kota to send a strong guy to go get an  immunity idol. I'm a pretty analytical thinker. You know, law school does that to you. So, I can crack this clue and I'm going to put in some hard work and do  whatever it takes to get it done. "You've arrived in Exile. A lovely, lonely place in this Garden of Eden, a difficult choice you'll face. One choice provides an apple; one choice provides direction. Spend your time in idle comfort or seek idol protection." Clue or  comfort? I could choose. I'm going with clue. I had chose clue right away, no questions asked because we're here for one  reason, and that's the million dollars. And one night of comfort is not going to help me get to that. Let's see what we got here. "Across the lake you see so well there lies a sandy crater. The object hidden in its floor will surely help you later." "A  sandy crater." "Across the lake you see so well." It's got to  be the clearing. Could be in the lake. "The object hidden in its floor will surely help you later."  "A sandy crater." This place is enormous. It could be anywhere. I don't see it coming from here. Frustrated that I can't beat the clue. Frustrated that I'm not smart enough to find this idol. Exile Island is officially the worst place ever. I don't care what the view is. These clues play with your mind. I can't possibly be this stupid that I'm missing something here. I should be able to figure this clue out, and right now, I'm just miserable. I'm tired. I'm thirsty, hungry. I've got cuts everywhere, all over my hands. And I cannot find this immunity idol. And I need this immunity idol. I'm not having any luck. Sucks. *  I don't think anybody should be depressed about our performance today? <br/>I agree. I absolutely agree. Listen...  We did really well. <br/>We did well. <br/>I think if you come-- if you come away from something knowing you did the  best you could, then that's what counts. <br/>We deserve lunch after it, for damn sure. <br/>No, but seriously, it was a huge improvement. We didn't get slaughtered. <br/>Right, right. <br/>Man, we lost another damn challenge today, for the third time in a row, and  it's frustrating 'cause, uh, we really need it, and, you know, especially the  fishing gear. It's just tough, you know, having to deal with the losses over and over again. You know, it starts to make you feel like you might not ever win. <br/>Oh, man! Like on a personal and serious note, okay. How do you feel about our tribe? <br/>Right now, we're lacking kind of, like, the physical part. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Like, today, like, everyone was doing their job except for like Gillian. All the challenges so far here have been physical. So we haven't been winning any challenges because we're losers. So, you have to learn from your mistakes that why we lost and right now the  reason why we lost is Gillian. At Tribal, I'm putting down Gill, hands down no matter what. <br/>I'm just going to say it out loud. "Jeff, I don't even want to walk to the paper. Okay? I'm just going to tell you right now 'cause I even ain't got the energy to  walk up there. Gillian."  So you, too, then. <br/>Huh? <br/>You, too. <br/>I don't know if there's any possibility that, uh, anybody's interested in  kind of looking at the group and seeing who might be a surprise vote out at  this stage. 'Cause that could be not a bad thing because I'll tell you what, it's the  young ones that are ganging up against us. <br/>That's right. I've seen that, too. So that could swing both ways. I'm just kind of wondering where I'm at. <br/>Well, I hate to say it, but personally, I don't want to see the-the strongest  people go, but there are some very weak young people. <br/>And who would you take out? <br/>I'd go for Kenny first. <br/>You'd do Kenny? <br/>That's who I would...  Sometimes if you think too much, we're-we're going to dig ourselves a hole. <br/>Well, true, but I really think we need to start thinking. Otherwise, we've dug our hole, we're in it, and the nails are on the coffin. You're-you're next. They'll get rid of me first, but you're next. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm telling you, they're going to wipe us out. <br/>I know. I know. <br/>The possibility is that I will be booted because I'm a drag on the team. At every challenge I'm the walking target. I don't just have the target on my back. I'm it. There are a lot of twists down the road and something could change. We've got to start working on it 'cause otherwise my target's going to be hit. *  Another Tribal Council for us again tonight because we haven't won a  challenge yet. There's really nothing we can do about that right now, but we have a problem  just-just pulling it together when it-- when it's crunch time, when it's time  to go. We're just not making it happen. We really need something around this place. We need a boost. We're a very needy tribe right about now. We need some food more than anything, probably. *  I think this part under the earpiece here is our best bet, you know. This stuff bends pretty easy. And, shoot, I've got another half there. <br/>Right on, dude. <br/>Finally, we came up with a group effort. Randy, he's-he's pretty good. He took his grasses, broke 'em apart, and made a fishing hook out of it. That is beau-ti-ful! The early hopper catches the fish. With his fishing hook and-and my shoestrings, it's definitely a group effort. Like, um, this morning, I think Crystal, Sue, and maybe even Gillian, they  all went and looked for worms, and they found six worms. <br/>Oh, I got another! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah, baby. <br/>Everybody's helping, and it's working out for everybody. <br/>Don't worry. We'll catch a fish. <br/>Okay, boys. <br/>Okay. <br/>Go make Mama proud. *  Come on, fishes! Go for the worm. Come on, buddy. You know you want it. Oh, it's a big one. <br/>Oh, it's coming back. It's coming back. Seize it. Okay, pull. <br/>Ow! No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Success! Finally! We caught some damn fish around this place. <br/>Now, that is meat. <br/>We lost reward challenge that was supposed to get us fishing gear, but we  caught fish anyway. We don't need that stuff. We're good. We're survival experts. <br/>We got something. We got five sardines. <br/>Let's see 'em. <br/>Got 'em, y'all. <br/>We got some sardines. <br/>Oh, yes! Thank you! <br/>All right! <br/>Thank you! <br/>It looks good! <br/>Ooh, I can smell 'em. <br/>Mmm. <br/>Oh, look at that. <br/>The Fang Tribe has protein, finally, after six days now, and it feels good. <br/>Oh, it's Dan coming back. <br/>Oh, good. <br/>All right. <br/>Man's back. <br/>All right! Come on back. <br/>It's a bad place. <br/>Welcome back. <br/>No, but it was not-not fun at all. Thank you so much. <br/>How was it? <br/>Did you have fire? <br/>Did you have any food? <br/>I can't really talk about it. <br/>Oh. Why, it was so bad? (mumbling)  No. I mean, there was a good... I just made the bad choice. <br/>What? <br/>There's, like, a choice when you get there. <br/>Oh. <br/>If we have to send one of their tribe members, we need to think about it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You send a weak player, they may just quit right there. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think a weak player...  You send a strong player, they may find the idol and be even stronger. <br/>True. Plus, a stronger player...  But I don't know if anyone is going to find that thing. I looked, like, five or six hours. <br/>I figured. I said, "I bet Dan's is gonna be going all over the place looking for  that."  Couldn't find it. I was going berserk. <br/>Dan's back from Exile Island, and, uh, he was acting real strange, man. Like, I just don't get this guy. <br/>Oh, man, it really makes you rethink, like, your reasons for doing this. (laughter)  I'm guessing that he-he either knows where it is, or Dan has the immunity  idol right now. <br/>Yeah, something's fishy with Dan, for sure. <br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is. <br/>Fishy. He either ate, or he's got the idol. <br/>I think Dan is cool. <br/>Something's up, dude. <br/>If Dan has the immunity idol right now, it affects my game because he will  hold the power of the tribe. <br/>The two people on the block right now is Dan or Gillian. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay. <br/>Like-Like 100%...  We cannot trust Dan 100%. <br/>50-50. <br/>100%. <br/>50...  Yeah. <br/>He's definitely got the idol, dude. He's acting too weird. <br/>(laughing): No...  He's too comfortable. <br/>He's not tripping out like normal. <br/>I think he's just paranoid. I think he's just really, really tired and had a tough night. I really do. <br/>You don't think he's got it, dude, you really don't? <br/>I really don't. <br/>He's coming back. <br/>He's a smart person. I think he has it. <br/>He's coming back. <br/>Isn't the plan, according to everybody, Gillian? <br/>What? No. Right now, the way things seems is, it could be Dan. <br/>I'd rather have Gillian go. <br/>If you guys decide Dan goes first, I'm definitely going with you. <br/>We got to weigh our options, too. My whole thing is, Dan is smart, and I think that Dan is going to try to...  He's not smart enough. <br/>He's a lawyer. It takes a person with a certain swagger to be a lawyer. Not everybody is cut out to be lawyers. (snorts)  Probst: Catch me up on what's happened in the last few days. Last time I saw you, you decided we need a leader. GC's going to be the leader. How's it going being the leader? <br/>Well, uh, it was...  It was? <br/>It was going all right for a day or two, but my group kind of volunteered me  to be the leader, and that's not a position that I want to be in in this game  with this tribe. And I told them, you know, I don't want to be the leader of the group. <br/>Probst: Susie, what happened? <br/>There was a little conflict between Gillian, I think. She just wanted to voice her opinion about something, and GC felt like he was  being attacked. So, that's kind of what happened. It kind of just fell apart. <br/>And it definitely doesn't mean I'm not helping out. It doesn't mean I'm not giving my opinion. It doesn't mean we're not working together as a group. It just means that I'm not the one that everybody is looking to for some kind  of guidance, which some people just really don't need anyway. <br/>Probst: Randy, what's the problem right now with the tribe? <br/>We've got eight individuals. Period. I see where GC is coming from. I wouldn't want to lead this bunch, either. <br/>Probst: Dan, is the problem that there's just too many disruptive forces? I'm up; you're down? I'm left; you're right? <br/>I think it's lack of leadership. And I can understand that you don't want to be voted off for standing up. I mean, you just kind of made a face and shook your head when I said that,  but that's no different than what Randy just said. <br/>And I was, like, "If you really feel like we need a leader, how about  somebody else step in, wants to be that person?" And what did everybody  do? <br/>Probst: Crystal, are you frustrated that you don't have a leader? <br/>It can be a little bit frustrating, but sometimes, our day-to-day chores at  the house, we don't need a leader. If we see the wood is going low, somebody is going to get up. But when it's time to go to war, Jeff, I'm all about in the zone. I need to hear about how we're going to get our heads together and how we're  going to kick Kota's butt. <br/>I agree there. It's the strategies and the discipline and the challenges that we need to  pull together on, and we all need to agree. Otherwise, we're doomed. <br/>Probst: GC, tell me about camp life. Has it gotten any better? <br/>It got a little bit better, man, 'cause, uh, the homie Randy right here made  us a fishing hook. Crystal and Sue, and I think Gill even, were out getting worms this morning. And me and Kenny hopped on the boat, and we caught, like, five fish. They were small, but, hey, it helped out a lot. It made us feel a lot better. <br/>Probst: Dan, tell me about Exile Island. <br/>It's a... It's a tough place. I mean, it's a good opportunity, but it can really mess with your mind a  little bit. Searching for that idol comes with its price because you could spend all day  looking for the idol and not find it. So, it can play that trick on you a little bit, being out there. <br/>Probst: Matt, are you at all concerned over whether Dan may have found the  hidden immunity idol already? <br/>Yeah, there's a little concern. <br/>Probst: Crystal, did you guys talk about it? <br/>You know we did! (laughter) Okay, it's bound to happen. Yes, we talked, and I think Dan is a very smart gentleman. And I think you got the idol. (laughing): That's just my thing. I think you found it. But, you know, as limited... as limited clues...  I don't see any idol in there, sister. <br/>It's fine. It's limited clues. <br/>I-I don't lie. I just don't lie. <br/>I don't discount anyone or anytng in this gam  I don't have the idol. I wish I did. So don't try and flush it out, please! I don't want to go home. <br/>Probst: All right. It is time to vote. Dan, you're up. <br/>You're a sweet woman, but I think this is where the group's going. For all I know, it could be me. <br/>My vote tonight is for Kenny. He just doesn't get a clue a lot of the time. So, good luck, Kenny. <br/>Sorry. I wish it wasn't you, but it is. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Probst: If anybody has the hidden immunity idol, and you want to play it, now  would be the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. <br/>First vote: Gillian. Kenny. One vote Gillian; one vote Kenny. Gillian. Two votes Gillian; one vote Ken. Gillian. That's three votes Gillian; one vote Ken. Gillian. That's four votes Gillian; one vote Ken. Second person voted out of Survivor: Gabon: Gillian. That's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Gillian, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Bummer. <br/>Probst: Time for you to go. <br/>Bye, guys. Good luck. <br/>Probst: Well, the best news to come out of tonight's Tribal Council is that  you realize that when you work together, you are successful. Now, you just need to do it a little more often. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

Drop it. <br/>I don't have to drop nothing, man. I can ask you something if I want. <br/>Probst: They've lost three challenges in a row. Now they're in for the fight of their lives in order to stay in the game. <br/>Let go...! <br/>There's a huge part of me that would have wished that I could have won  Survivor: Africa because I'm still not done with wanting to play it. Guess it doesn't work to speak your mind when you know you really shouldn't. I should have just continued flying low under the radar, and I didn't. It has been an absolutely fantastic experience, and I wish the tribe good  luck because I think they're going to need it.
