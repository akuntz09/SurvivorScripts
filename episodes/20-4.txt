<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor: Heroes, for the second time in a row,  you guys will lose somebody at Tribal Council. By day six, the Heroes had lost two challenges and were beaten and  demoralized. <br/>If we don't become a cohesive team, we will continue to lose. <br/>Probst: Things were so bad that some of the Heroes started to behave like  villains. James bullied the tribe. <br/>One voice. That's all I ask. Then I get people telling everybody they're wrong. <br/>Probst: And J.T. was equally villainous. <br/>I'm going to form alliances with everyone I can. My strategy is to keep everyone on my side, man. <br/>Probst: He made conflicting deals with both James and Tom. At the Villains' camp, Rob's heroic actions made him the de facto tribe  leader. <br/>You are the man, and it's like, when you're talking, I'm just hanging on  every word. <br/>I appreciate it. <br/>Rob thinks he's the boss of the camp, but this is my mountain and I'm still  the king of the hill. <br/>Probst: Russell got fed up with his tribe following Rob and staged a  rebellion by hiding the machete. <br/>Getting rid of the machete will cause conflict in this camp, and that's a  good thing. <br/>Probst: Go! <br/>Tom, get him! <br/>Yeah! Go, go! <br/>Probst: But at the last immunity challenge, everything changed. Heroes win! The Heroes destroyed the Villains in a huge blowout. In addition to immunity, you have coffee, sugar. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Sandra called out Coach for being lazy. <br/>Coach'll delegate, "You do this and I'll do this and we'll go do  that," but then when you look, Coach is gone two miles out. <br/>Probst: But in the end, the entire tribe voted out their oldest and most  abrasive member. Randy, the tribe has spoken. Now, if the Villains can't get their act together, the Heroes will even the  score. 17 are left. 17 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Sandra tried to call me out in Tribal tonight, and it was just very  disheartening. I'm human, I'm sensitive. I'm probably more sensitive than most people. I just hide it behind a lot of things that I've done and accomplished and  behind a lot of machismo. What did I do to deserve Sandra saying that tonight? There's never been somebody like me out here and there's never going to be  anybody like me again. All of this, man, I don't need it. I'm ... the man, and I don't need anybody to tell me or validate that. I'm the only person out here that will not ... compromise. [Coach clears throat]  I understand where you're  I understand where you're coming from, dude. coming from, dude. <br/>It's unbelievable, man. Why doesn't anybody ever say anything good about me? Am I that bad of a person, man? Nobody ever does, man. I'm sensitive. <br/>Coach, I know you're sensitive, dude. sensitive, dude. <br/>But, dude...  But, dude...  If you want to stick it out, I'll help you through it. <br/>Thanks for coming out here, man. <br/>No problem, dude. <br/>No problem, dude. Just let me know how I can help. Just let me know how I can help. I promise you. <br/>Like what? <br/>Don't wear feathers in your hair at Tribal. Don't tell your stories. People don't believe your stories. They mock you. There's no reason to tell them. And do your tai chi in private And do your tai chi in private where nobody  can see you. where nobody can see you. <br/>Coach pulled me aside and said he wanted to go home, but the Villains do need  Coach in the game. I mean, he's, he's much, much stronger than the last time he played  physically, and that's what we need right now. <br/>I'm telling you, dude, I  I'm telling you, dude, I don't care what anybody says. don't care what anybody says. <br/>When we got back from Tribal Council, Coach broke down in tears and said he  didn't think the game deserved his nobility, and he wanted to quit the game,  so I told him to stick in there and he knew what he was getting into. It's not like any of us are Survivorvirgins. <br/>Is he okay, Tyson? <br/>He's sad. He talked to me last night and said he was really thinking about just going  home. <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah. He cried. He was, like, sobbing. <br/>I can't believe that. This morning has been a little bit of an attitude shift. Coach had a little sob session with Tyson, wanted to quit the game or  something. I don't know. That's not much of a coach, if you ask me. What was that all about, man? <br/>It's just I feel like I'm on the outside. I want to bond with you, but I feel like you started playing the game...  I'm gonna tell you something right now. You're not on the outside. Okay? I'm gonna tell you that. We're good. Look it, it's going to be okay, for real, man. Come here. I know you're hurting. It's all right. <br/>I want-- I mean, I, like, want to, like, sharpen each other out here. I want to, like, do stuff together. <br/>Then you're going to have to trust me. Like, literally trust me, and you're going to be fine. All right? <br/>But I feel like the only time you, like, want to bond with me is when we're  getting up for the challenges, which is cool, and if that's all you want...  I'm not gonna say anymore. I'm gonna say you have to trust me. And it's all about this island, all right, so don't worry about it. Don't sweat it, man, and pick your ... head up and act like a man, for real. All right? <br/>All right. I'm different than most people. I'm one of a kind. The last of the Mohicans, King Arthur-- a legend. Nobody out here has got what I have. Confucius says that the greatest glory a man can have is not in never falling  but in rising again every time he falls, and I fell hard last night. You got to be weak to be strong. There's power in weakness. Today's challenge, you'll see an Today's challenge, you'll see an even  fiercer warrior from me. even fiercer warrior from me. <br/>Yay! <br/>All right. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Read it, read it. <br/>"Choose from this mountain of goods, Some items to help you improve your  life."  Yeah. <br/>"Work like a well-oiled machine, To alleviate your hardships and  strife."  It's the catalog! <br/>Whoo-hoo! <br/>"Sears: Life. Well Spent."  Oh, my God. <br/>Yeah, I love that. <br/>Yes! <br/>What does it say-- how many we can pick? <br/>Two items. <br/>Fishing kit. <br/>Oh! <br/>Yes! <br/>We kind of proved at the last challenge that we're serious about this now and  we're more united, and I think it's changed us as a tribe. So if the Villains walk away with this Sears stuff, I'm going to be mad  because I don't want to be mad because I don't want to lose momentum. to lose momentum. to lose momentum. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Heroes getting your first look at the new Villain tribe. Randy voted out at the last Tribal Council. All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, you are going to race head to head as you  slide down a slippery course to retrieve a numbered ball that I will randomly  assign each round. Once you have the ball, toss it in your basket. First person to get their ball in their basket scores a point for their tribe. First tribe to four wins reward. Let's get to the reward. This morning, in your treemail, you received a Sears circular with a ton of  products to choose from. Heroes, you chose a well[1]equipped  tackle box and a fishing pole and the kitchen set-- everything you need to  catch food, cook food. Villains, you went a different route-- a very full tool kit, along with a  tarp, twine, and a multifunction tool-- everything you guys need to build,  I'm guessing, a better shelter. All right, Villains, you're sitting out one person. It must be a woman. Keep in mind you cannot sit out the same person at back-to-back challenges. <br/>I'll sit out. <br/>Probst: All right, Parvati, take a spot on the bench. take a spot on the bench.

The more speed, the further you will go. Russell not messing around. Grabs his ball, and he is off. Cirie having to crawl on her hands and knees to get to the number nine. Russell with a big advantage now. A lot of extra time, more shots. Cirie still not here. <br/>That's it. <br/>Probst: Russell scores for the Villains. Villains lead 2-zip. <br/>Good job, Russ. <br/>Probst: Next two-- for the Villains, Courtney taking on Candice for the  Heroes. You're going for number two. Survivors ready? Go! Candice not messing around at all. Courtney with a good slide. Both women get to their balls quickly. Candice has hers. Courtney has hers. Got to get the ball in the hoop now. Candice scores for the Heroes! Villains lead 2-1. <br/>Come on. <br/>Probst: All right, next round-- Jerri taking on Amanda. You are going to number six. Survivors ready? Go! [indistinct shouting] Amanda gets there first. Amanda has her ball. Amanda has her ball. Jerri now has her ball. Jerri now has her ball. Amanda shoots and misses for the Heroes. Jerri scores for the Villains! Villains lead, three-one. Next round. Sandra taking on James. You are going for number five. Villains lead it, three-one. We're playing to four. If Sandra scores, Villains win reward. <br/>Come on, Sandra! <br/>Probst: Survivors ready? <br/>No pressure. <br/>No pressure. <br/>Probst: Go! <br/>Probst: Go! James, no trouble, grabs the ball, keeps going, up on his feet like he's done  it before. Sandra crawling her way to number five. James scores for the Heroes! Villains lead, three-two. Next round, Danielle for the Villains taking on Rupert for the Heroes. Villains lead it, three-two. We are playing to four. If Danielle scores, Villains win. You're going for number one. Survivors ready? Go! Danielle not messing around, launches herself. Has her ball first. Rupert loses his. Rupert playing with a broken toe. Danielle drops her ball now. Everybody panicking. Big reward on the line. Both tribes want it. Rupert must score to keep the Heroes in it. <br/>Come on, Rupert, take your time. <br/>Probst: Danielle can win it for the Villains. [frustrated shouts] The Villains can smell that reward. Rupert scores for the Heroes! We are tied, three-three. [Rupert yells] It's going to come down to one last point. Last match-up of this challenge will be Colby for the Heroes taking on Tyson  for the Villains. Winner wins reward for their tribe. You're going for number ten. You're going for number ten. Survivors ready? Survivors ready? Survivors ready? Go! Go! Donaldson has his ball. Tyson right behind. Tyson has his ball. Donaldson gets off the first shot. Just misses. Tyson... just misses. <br/>Come on, Tyson, you got it! <br/>Come on, Tyson! <br/>Probst: Tyson just misses again for the Villains. Both guys very close. <br/>You can do it! <br/>Come on, Tyson! <br/>Probst: Tyson scores for the Villains! Villains! Villains win reward! Villains win reward! All right, Heroes, I got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Congratulations, Villains. Come grab your reward. <br/>Sears! <br/>Sears! [whoops] [whoops]  Good work. <br/>All right! <br/>Well done. The challenge was great, and the dragon slayer's feeling top[1]notch. I'm ready to rock and roll, and I'm ready to move forward. Will I change? No. Will I be the dragon slayer and slay everybody? Yes. Will I wear my heart on my sleeve every day? Absolutely, unequivocably, yes. Absolutely, unequivocably, yes. <br/>Nice. <br/>Nice. <br/>I open the tools, I grab this serrated blade, and I notice something in it  immediately. something in it immediately. [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter]  A little note here in this. <br/>Uh-oh. <br/>There you go. <br/>Woops. <br/>I thought that it was something that holds the blade in place. I wasn't thinking. And I'm like, man! I just blew it! <br/>"An immunity idol is hidden at your camp, and you have found the clue. Head down to the beach to a crazy palm which juts out over the sea. Go just beyond it and to the right and dig around the roots of the double  tree."  So I grabbed the note. Little did I know it was a clue to a hidden immunity idol. Who knew? There were never any hidden immunity idols when I played the game. What do you guys want to do? We can all go find it and then We can all go find it and then do what with it? do what with it? <br/>If you get it, we're going to write your name down so that we force you to  use it. It's not fair for one person to have an immunity idol. <br/>Rob says we're finding the hidden immunity idol all together and we'll get  rid of it, but they're too dumb to walk even down the beach. This is a bunch of idiots out here! Man, if I could find that hidden immunity idol, I will become powerful in  this game. <br/>Could you guys give me a little help here? We got to clean all of this, and we have to make a floor. <br/>Okay. <br/>And then we can take a piece of wood and push it out, so it's more of a  shelter. <br/>Yep. <br/>There's no way that I can get a clue for the hidden immunity idol and not  find it. That's not going to happen. So I'm thinking that that's the palm over the water, and they have two trees  right next to have two trees right next to it, so I'm going to find it. it, so I'm going to find it. it, so I'm going to find it. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>The question is, is he really going for a walk, or is really going for a  walk, or is he going looking for the idol? he going looking for the idol? <br/>I mean, it sucks, but that's  I mean, it sucks, but that's what we said, right? what we said, right? <br/>That's what we said. We said, if you go for it, then you seal your own fate. <br/>Exactly. <br/>Russell's a bonehead. He's like the hobbit on crack. And you know what? I don't trust Russell's ass at all. And the safest thing to do with someone like that is to just get someone like  that is to just get rid of him right away. rid of him right away. <br/>Oh, me, too, by far. Everybody slept pretty sound Everybody slept pretty sound last night. last night. You can put a little more, maybe. <br/>'Cause it was kind of weak, wasn't it? wasn't it? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Oh. <br/>Hmm. <br/>I wonder what this is? <br/>I don't know, but hurry up and open it. <br/>Oh, "An immunity idol is hidden at your camp... and you have found the  clue. At the end of your beach, you'll find the right angle. In a clearing are three sections of a tree. One tall, one fallen, and one on the ground. Dig under the rock beneath the Dig under the rock beneath the 90  degrees." 90 degrees." [Tom laughs] Think one of us was supposed to  find this and not all of us? [laughter]  For real! <br/>This morning everything changed. As we poured out the coffee, we found a clue to a hidden immunity idol  somewhere on our beach. Colby and I are on the outs with this tribe with no way to get in, so we need  this to stay get in, so we need this to stay alive in this game. alive in this game. alive in this game. <br/>There went J.T. <br/>There went J.T. <br/>Hmm. <br/>Hmm. [laughs] [laughs] [laughs]  I think I'll go this way. <br/>I think I'll go this way. <br/>I think I'll go this way. <br/>Damn! <br/>Damn! <br/>We searched the first clearing. I moved to the next one, immediately saw a leaning tree, a fallen tree, an  upstanding tree, forming a triangle. Everybody was going to see it, I felt, so I had to get down I felt, so I had  to get down and try to get it first. and try to get it first. James arrived. I moved to a different spot, 'cause I could see that the sand was a little  loose. I knew I was on it. So I dug quickly. And while nobody was looking, I found the immunity idol, dropped it into my  sock. Now, a few more people are on the scene. We got... Candice is over there. It's getting a little crowded, and I have no idea what to do and I have no  idea what to do with this thing. with this thing. <br/>Tom, he was acting a little funny, and when I came up on him, I saw him put  something into his sock, and then he went behind a tree. So I knew he had it. <br/>Like, there's a lot of rocks under here. <br/>Tom has it. <br/>Aw, shucks. <br/>You know, we were getting along so good. Now this is going to make everybody crazy again. everybody crazy again. <br/>She did? All right. <br/>She did? All right. <br/>The hidden immunity idol changed the whole playing field, and that's all we  needed. We needed an opening. Tom and I needed an opening to get back in this game. Granted, neither Tom nor myself, we're not comfortable. But we're in a little bit better of a position than we better of a position  than we were a couple of days ago. were a couple of days ago. were a couple of days ago. <br/>Yeah, right, what a morning. <br/>Yeah, right, what a morning. <br/>Yeah, right, what a morning. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Probst: First things first, J.T. Give it up. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, one person will be strapped inside a giant ball. That person must then guide two other tribe members, who will be blindfolded,  as they push the ball down a long, winding course to a table maze. The person inside the ball must then guide four other tribe members, also  blindfolded, as they maneuver the ball through the table maze to the finish  hole. First tribe to finish wins immunity, lives to see another day. Losers go to Tribal Council. Somebody will be voted out. This entire season, we've been doing classic challenges from past seasons of  Survivor. This challenge is classic for another reason. This is the only challenge in the history of Survivorto not be completed. It was stopped last season due to a medical emergency. So although Russell has run this challenge, one of these two tribes will get  the honor and distinction of being the first tribe to win it. Villains, you're sitting out two people in this challenge. Who's sitting out? <br/>Courtney and Sandra. <br/>Probst: Courtney and Sandra sitting this one out. Heroes, you're sitting out one person. Who's it going to be? <br/>Cirie. <br/>Probst: Cirie sitting out for the Heroes. Sit-outs, take a spot on the bench. Give you a minute to strategize, Give you a minute to strategize, we'll get  started. we'll get started. All right, stepping up and leading for the Villains is Rob. Tom calling the shots for the Heroes. Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Doing good, doing good. <br/>Probst: Heroes off to a quick start. <br/>Keep doing what you're doing. <br/>Probst: Tom is guiding Rupert and James. <br/>You're ahead of them and just control. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob is guiding Coach and Tyson. <br/>Together, together, together! Together, together, together! <br/>Move to push, James! Go! <br/>Probst: We're neck and neck right now. <br/>...Tyson, now. Tyson now. Tyson now. Tyson now. <br/>Probst: Villains now in the lead. <br/>Come on, guys, move it now, move it now. We're wide open, wide open. Wide open. [thudding]  Probst: Rob takes a big hit on that tree. <br/>Together. <br/>...take the turn, hard left! <br/>Keep going. There you go. Come on! <br/>That's good. A little towards Rupert. A little faster. They're just a little ahead of us. <br/>A little speed. Coach's side, Coach's side. <br/>Probst: Villains very close. <br/>Right to the side. <br/>Probst: Take off your blindfolds, Coach and Tyson. <br/>Okay, take 'em off, guys... Take 'em off. <br/>Probst: Get him in a position so he can see, and then you can start calling  shots. <br/>Right there. Okay, Parvati, down. <br/>Probst: Rob is guiding Parvati, Russell, Danielle and Jerri. <br/>Okay, good. <br/>Probst: Heroes are now here. <br/>I'm in. <br/>Probst: Take off your blindfolds, get him oriented. <br/>Get me straight. J.T. and Amanda, down to the left a little bit. <br/>Probst: Tom guiding Colby, Candice, J.T. and Amanda. <br/>A little more, a little more, a little more. Okay. <br/>Danielle, slowly lift it up. Russell down. <br/>Probst: If they're right, the Villains have a bit of a lead. <br/>I want Danielle and Russell to come up at the same time. Now. Good. Don't move, don't move. <br/>Colby and Candice towards my voice now. Towards the guys, towards the guys. A little more, a little more, a little more, and a hard left. Hard. Yes! Great! <br/>There's a little gate here, so this is going to be the tricky part, 'cause we  can't let it go through. Parvati up, up. Russell, up, up, up. Good, good. Don't move...  Probst: Rob with a big move for the Villains. <br/>All right, we want to go hard towards the ladies. Hard towards the ladies. Yes! Great! Perfect! <br/>Probst: Tom with a nice move for the Heroes. <br/>Russell and Danielle, slowly up. Parvati up. Okay, don't move, don't move, don't move! <br/>Probst: Very close now for the Villains. <br/>Keep going now. Amanda's corner down, J.T. up. <br/>Probst: Heroes close. <br/>Jerri down, Jerri down. Oh! <br/>Down towards Amanda. Oh! No! <br/>Jerri, up, up, up. And we got it. <br/>We got it! <br/>Probst: Villains win immunity! [cheering]  Oh, my God! [screaming]  I can't do anything. [indistinct chatter]  Hey, can someone help me out? <br/>Good job, Rob. <br/>Good team work. Good team work. <br/>Probst: All right, Rob, you stepped up in a very gutsy position as caller. Paid off. Immunity... for the Villains. <br/>Yay! [applause]  Probst: Heroes, you have the afternoon to figure out who's going home. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. <br/>We're going back to Tribal Council, and getting rid of Colby or Tom tonight  would be the smart thing to do. They have been on the outs with our tribe since maybe day three. And for my game, I need some of And for my game, I need some of these strong  people gone. these strong people gone. [sighing]  I'm sorry, guys. <br/>No, you had the hardest damn  No, you had the hardest damn job of it all. job of it all. <br/>The challenge was a heartbreaker. Colby and I are low men on the totem pole within the tribe, and the last  thing I need is to be marching off to Tribal Council tonight. I have the immunity idol, but I'm still a target, because they know it's in  my possession. So my game right now is biding my time and, uh, looking for the little cracks  in their alliance that we can use to save our necks. <br/>This is good, I think, for us. us. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Mm-hmm. Um, if we split the votes three and three...  Mm-hmm. <br/>...on Tom and Colby...  Mm-hmm. <br/>...and Tom plays the idol...  Uh-huh. <br/>...Colby goes home because he's the one with the next most. Okay? If Tom doesn't play the idol, that would force a tie between the two of them. Then the rest of us vote four on one and two on the other...  So, let me just get this straight-- tie-breaker. And they can't vote at all. <br/>And they can't vote at all. <br/>Oh, so we're good. <br/>So, if he plays the idol, then, yeah. <br/>So either way, we're good. <br/>Right. We're going to Tribal Council tonight, and we kind of have a plan of what we  want to do. Tom has the idol, and we need to be extra careful right now. But as long as we're all on the same page, yeah, theoretically, same page,  yeah, theoretically, it should work out. it should work out. <br/>Yeah, but he's not going to hurt us. <br/>It just scares me because Tom's smart, you know? <br/>I'm just telling you, I trust him a hell of a lot more than I trust Candice. I would love to have Tom and his idol in alliance with me, no doubt. Tom and Colby are both shoot-you-straight kind of guys. They look you in the eye, shake your hand, tell you how they feel, and you  can take it to the bank. <br/>Hey, there. <br/>But I'd rather have someone like that I can count on than Candice. The scrambling, the running around she's done the past couple of days. I don't trust her as far as I can throw her. <br/>So I'm trying to figure out what makes sense to you and you and James. And Colby and I, as partners, definitely makes more sense. I think you have two guys who are going to be honest, and two guys who are  going to compete better than Cirie and Candice. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>My concern is that because there is an immunity idol... I wish there wasn't  one, and I'm trying to figure out how to get that stain off of me. <br/>Why don't you just give me your word that immunity idol's not going to be  used against us or something. <br/>Oh, no, no. I swear to God, we'll play that thing as a committee. If there was no idol, I'd feel much better about this. The idol is scaring me. I can give it to you if one of you wants it, and then it's your idol. <br/>With Tom having the immunity idol, he's either a big threat, or someone great  to work with. I'm a little leery of him, because Tom has voted for me in Tribal Council,  but he was ready to give us the idol, and there's a part of him that I really  do a part of him that I really do think is honest. think is honest. <br/>We were just talking about that. that. <br/>I don't really trust Candice. <br/>I don't really trust Candice. <br/>I like her, but she's too scatter-brained. <br/>I mean, I just want to win. I just want the strongest team. <br/>I want to win, too. <br/>That's what I want, too. I am totally trusting you here, Tom. <br/>Okay. Come here. You know, I've been trying to ingratiate myself with the powers that be, and  I had a little something to bring to the table at this point, so a supposed  new alliance was born, but I don't believe or trust anybody in this game, so  we'll anybody in this game, so we'll see. see. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>He's, like, "Well, I don't even want this thing. I just want to be here. I'll even give it to one of you guys..." guys..."  Mm-hmm. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>That is the dumbest thing. Did he give it to you? <br/>Amanda. These are the same people that wanted you gone desperately. <br/>I know. <br/>Desperately. And now you're going to save them? This is so stupid. Tom and Colby, and they're a much bigger threat than she is. Can you beat them? Oh, my God! Amanda-- I love her to death, but she is not the sharpest tool in the shed. My alliance-- they're so wishy-washy. Like, these people, like, panic and do crazy stuff. Why didn't you tell me the plan was changing? was changing? Unbelievable! Unbelievable! Unbelievable! Unbelievable! If she was so untrustworthy, your girl right here wouldn't be standing here  now. With this one, at least we can keep her under control. <br/>Well, no. We haven't made up the final decision yet, though, babe. <br/>I know. Come on. Tom is very charismatic. He's very athletic. He's already won this game once before. Why keep someone like that in the game? It makes no sense. It's crazy. It makes no sense. It's crazy. <br/>Cirie is right. <br/>Cirie is right. Amanda wants to do it, but Cirie's talking the rest out of it. At this point, you need to get your idol out, get it, because I ain't got any  control any more. Cirie's the mastermind behind this whole deal. <br/>You know what? I thought that we had this thing solid this afternoon. Amanda-- after she talked to Cirie-- she broke faith, and this deal was off. Cirie's the puppet master, and she's got her arm jammed up there, so it could  be the end there, so it could be the end of us. of us. <br/>They're going to vote three  They're going to vote three for me, three for you. for me, three for you. for me, three for you. <br/>There you go. <br/>There you go. <br/>I've got to make a big decision, a very big decision. I've seen Cirie operate. I know how she plays. And it won't be long before she gets rid of someone like me. <br/>I think we do three and three to keep Candice in and keep our six strong. Yes? <br/>Yep. <br/>All right. <br/>And we're not going to discuss it no more. <br/>My gut's telling me to just go with the flow, write Colby's name down, and  don't piss everybody off, and my heart says I'm going to keep the good guys  in the game and get rid of Cirie, but you listen to your heart, you get hurt  out here, so it's all up to me. I know where everybody over here I know where everybody over here is voting,  except me. is voting, except me. <br/>Probst: So, last time you guys were at Tribal Council, you voted out Steph,  which seemed a little surprising, given that you've lost now three out of  four immunity challenges. So, Tom, where is the philosophy of the tribe in terms of voting people out? <br/>Stephenie was on the wrong side of the numbers formed on day one. She was with the wrong group, so she was sacrificed. <br/>Probst: So, Colby, if this game is already about alliances, is it inevitable  that great people are going to go home early merely because they're on the  wrong side of the numbers? <br/>It's unfortunate, but that looks to be what's going to take place. <br/>Probst: J.T., where is the wisdom in having alliances this early that cause  you to vote out somebody strong merely because they're on the wrong side of  the numbers? <br/>It's way too early to vote out people that should get used to beat the other  tribe. It's way too early for that, but unfortunately all of these people here are  good and they all have reasons why they should be here. <br/>Probst: So then what do you base the vote on? <br/>It's pretty simple-- you got to have people that's not going to get scared. They're going to stick to what they promised you to begin with. <br/>Probst: Rupert, how about you? What are you basing your vote on? <br/>Trying to figure out how the heck we can bond together in these challenges  and win. these challenges and win. But... But... I made alliances that-- and promises that I want to keep. <br/>Probst: So it sounds like what you're saying with that long pause is:  "Not sure it will be the best vote, but I will be keeping my word."   That is exactly what I am saying. I am keeping my word. <br/>Probst: Wow. <br/>I am going to stand up to what I said. <br/>Probst: What part of that makes sense? Keeping your word in a game called "Outwit, Outplay, Outlast"? Keeping your word because I'm an honorable man and I want people to see me  that way? 'Cause I'm looking at a tribe who-- you all keeping your word, great. All it's doing is giving you more time with me at Tribal Council. <br/>And sitting here at Tribal Council sucks, and I know I j...  Probst: You're a part of the reason, based on that philosophy, Rupert. <br/>I know I am. <br/>Probst: That's the most honest and illuminating answer we've had in any of  our Tribals together. So, Cirie, how worried are you tonight that you might be going home? <br/>I'm always worried, always. <br/>Tom, do you believe Cirie is worried that she's going home tonight? <br/>I believe that Cirie is not worried that she's going home tonight. <br/>Probst: Colby, are you concerned you're going home? <br/>Without question. It's going to take a bold move to save me tonight. <br/>Probst: James, how you voting tonight? <br/>We need to win. I want gifts. I want that food. I want to hold the idol. I want to do all that good stuff, you know? <br/>Are you going to base your vote on that tonight? <br/>Yes, yes, sir. <br/>What you just said you wanted? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Okay. <br/>I want everybody to stop all this crazy stuff and to win. <br/>Probst: What's the crazy stuff? <br/>Just the whole social thing. The social game is a distraction. James don't do this stuff. <br/>But, James, it's a necessity if your name is the one on the top of the list  to go home. <br/>Yes, sir, I hear you. <br/>I agree, it's not fun, but it's necessary when you're the one faced with  leaving, you know. <br/>Probst: J.T., how concerned are you that you're going home? <br/>I don't feel like I'm going home tonight, and a lot of people are going to  hate me for saying it, but if I didn't trust the people that I put my trust  in tonight, I probably would already be gone, and I mean, I trust these  people I'm in alliance with tonight. <br/>Probst: Well, there's a lot of talk tonight about trust and an equal amount  of apparent dissension, so I'm really curious to see how the vote plays out. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Rupert, you're up. Rupert, you're up. <br/>I think you're a great guy, but hopefully it's you and not but hopefully it's  you and not me tonight. me tonight. <br/>Love you as a person, but you're way too good at wrapping some of these  really weak minds some of these really weak minds around your little finger. around your little finger. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. <br/>Jeff. I have something that I was hoping not to use until this team was able to use  it against the Villains, but evident in camp today was I needed it to save  myself, so... I'd like to play the immunity idol. <br/>Probst: Thank you. The rules of Survivorstate that if somebody plays the hidden immunity idol,  then any votes cast against them will not count and the person with the next  highest number of votes will be sent home. This is, indeed, a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Tom will not count. count. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote-- Tom. First vote-- Tom. Does not count. Does not count.

Everybody went, except for Russell. <br/>Probst: Russell hunts for the immunity idol while Rob hunts Russell. <br/>If you go out there looking for it, you're a marked man. <br/>Probst: Candice makes a game[1]changing  move. <br/>I want to work with Tom and Colby. <br/>Probst: And as the competition gets more fierce, another castaway goes down. Hold up, let the docs take a Hold up, let the docs take a look. look. <br/>Maybe I said too much or stepped on J.T.'s toes, but I couldn't just sit back  and play J.T.'s game. I'm playing this game for myself as well, so I couldn't do it. I don't blame them at all. I felt like I was gotten with one of my moves. You know, my hats off to them. You know, my hats off to them. They got me.
