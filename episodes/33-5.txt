<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," at the  millennial tribe, Figgy and Taylor couldn't hide their love. <br/>You kissed her last night? <br/>Jeff: At the gen-x tribe, a blind-sided Bret and Chris  sought revenge on Jessica. But David and Ken wanted to save her. <br/>Ken says they're gunning for me, but it seems a little  suspicious. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council...  Jeff. <br/>Jeff: David played his idol for Jessica. <br/>This is a hidden immunity idol. <br/>Jeff: Saving her and sending Lucy home. Lucy, the tribe has spoKen. 16 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. <br/>Y'all can let me have it now or not. It's up to you. <br/>I’m not mad at you, David. <br/>I’m not either. I'm just curious as to why. <br/>I played an idol tonight,  but I don't know that playing that idol was the right move because I saved  someone who nobody really wants to work with, and now I don't have an idol,  and I’m incredibly vulnerable. <br/>I owe dave and you so  much, and I’m sorry I didn't listen. I should have. Can I tell you something I haven't told anybody? I found a setting -- a legacy advantage. If I’m still here on day 36, I'll receive an advantage in the  game. If I had been voted out, I would have handed it to you, because  you were trying to help me. I told Ken about the legacy advantage because I wanted him to  know that he can trust me. So I’m hoping that that bought me some more goodwill. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jess says that she has a legacy and she's willing to share  it with me, and that means a lot. I'm giving jess my full trust again. <br/>This game just messes with you so much. <br/>We're going to look everywhere. Ain't no shame today, isn't that right, CeCe. <br/>What? <br/>Ain't no shame in looking for the idol today. <br/>Ain't in shame looking for the idol. The immunity idol is back up for grabs, so we kind of had an  idol search party. <br/>It's an interesting little area over here. <br/>It is. We openly were on the hunt for a hidden immunity idol. I felt empowered that I was the only one who knew to look for a  symbol of our tribe, but the one issue with an open idol hunt is that  everybody is looking for the idol, and you might be seen having found it. <br/>So frustrating. <br/>Keep looking, Sunday. <br/>So I’m wandering the jungle, and then I just turn and I spot  on the ground a log with our tribe's symbol on it. But right nearby was Sunday and CeCe. And I’m thinking, oh, this is the worst, this is the worst. <br/>Any luck? <br/>No luck. You? <br/>No. <br/>This is exhausting. Eventually CeCe gets bored and goes back the camp. So does Sunday. Yep, that's the sound of an idol inside all right. I know you're in there. Immunity idol. I found the other one. Oh, my God. I can't believe I’m so fortunate to play an idol and then find  it again the very next day. "Congratulations. You find the hidden immunity idol. The hidden immunity idol will keep you safe from being voted off  at tribal council." exactly what I love and crave. I've tasted no victory in my real life compared toot victory I feel  right now in "Survivor." it's just a shame it took me until 42  years of age to get it, but I want to be that guy, because that's going to  get me further in this game. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. Millennials getting your first look at the new gen-x tribe. Lucy voted out at the last tribal council. All right. Shall we get to it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Well, there are so many elements to the game of  "Survivor." knots and puzzles you can practice in your backyard. You can go to therapy, learn how to get along with people  better, but there are some elements that you have absolutely no control over,  and yet they can change your game just like that. Everybody, drop your buffs. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Jeff: We are switching things up. <br/>Jeff: Everybody drop your buffs. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Jeff: We're switching things up. It's going to get a little more interesting. We're not only going to mix up the tribes, we're going to switch  from two tribes to three tribes. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, we weren't expecting that. <br/>Jeff: If you draw an orange buff, you will return to what  was the millennial beach. Your new tribe name will be Vanua. If you draw a purple buff, you'll return to what was gen-x. Your new tribe name is Takali. If you draw a green buff, you will go to a new beach. Your tribe name will be ekaboula, and you will have to start  from scratch. <br/>Oh, my gosh. To help offset that work, you will have one extra tribe member. All right. Shall we see what's going to happen? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Get this over with. <br/>Jeff: Don't open them yet. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>The swap is random. You have no idea what's going to happen, especially like me and  figs, with this little romance going on. My biggest fear right now is getting split up. Give me something good, Jeff. <br/>Moment of truth, baby. <br/>Jeff: Let's do it. Everybody reveal. If you're green, you go in the middle where there is no mat. Hold them up once you get it, put them on. Michaela green and not happy. <br/>I’m purple. <br/>Purple. <br/>Jeff: Bret is green. Jay is green. Michaela is wearing it on her face. <br/>CeCe. Nice the meet you. <br/>Jeff: All right. Let's take a look at our new tribes. Takali, we have three millennials, they -- Taylor, Figgy and Adam,  along with two gen-xers, Jessica and Ken. Figgy, you're smiling big. <br/>I just want that man. <br/>Rock on. Fig-tails continues. I was so stoked because I've got the numbers, and I have fig, so  it could not go any better for me. <br/>Jeff: Vanua, we have three gen-xers, CeCe, Chris and dave,  and two millennials, Zeke and Michelle. Zeke, you were on the majority tribe with a winning streak. You're now in the minority on a tribe of only five, not many  places to hide. <br/>Yeah, it's tricky. The numbers are definitely not in my favor, but, you know, I look  around, I see a strong tribe. I see a tribe that I think can continue the winning streak. <br/>Jeff: And for ekaboula, we have four millennials, Michaela,  Hannah, Jay and will, and two gen-xers, Sunday and Bret. Michaela, you still seem unhappy right now. <br/>You didn't do this right, Jeff, just saying. <br/>Jeff: All right. Fair enough. I'll take it. <br/>I open up my buff and I see  green. Man, I was pissed. You going to send us to an empty beach where we got to make the  shelter and we don't have any food. I just want to flip him off right there, but I didn't. <br/>Jeff: Ekaboula, map to your home. Good luck building that shelter. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Jeff: All right. Head out. Get to know your new tribe. <br/>This is like the disaster scenario. I'm on the one tribe where the millennials are not in the  numbers, and I’m with Michelle, the one person from my tribe I have zero  trust in. And we're outnumbered, so we're in a bad spot. <br/>You guys want introductions? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah. <br/>Bret. <br/>Jay. <br/>Will. <br/>Michaela. <br/>Sunday. <br/>Sunday andry in serious trouble, but gen-xers, we have a  drive to get through tough times in life and not to quit. So we hit the well and then we'll get to the shelter. <br/>Yeah. <br/>So I need to prove to them that I’m worth keeping around,  because right now it's all about surviving this game. Let's do it. <br/>On the millennial side of things, everyone says we're just  dreamers, but the truth is most of us are relentless. Do you want to make an indentation in that one, so it can sit on  it? <br/>I have no idea. <br/>Kind of like this? The gen-xers said we work hard and do things the right way, but  the people I have now are Bret and Sunday, and they can't figure things out  for themselves and they sit become and wait for you to say something. <br/>The kid knows how to do everything, huh? That's cool, huh. <br/>But even if I got to build a new shelter, I’m happy  because we have the numbers. Four millennials, two gen-xers, see ya later, gen-xers, because  even if I lose a challenge, I don't care, boop, you're out of here. <br/>This is now your home. <br/>Well done. Super cool. So different than ours. <br/>You guys want a tour? <br/>Let's do it, man. <br/>We went back the camp. It was interesting. The millennials definitely bring some high energy, some goofy  energy to the tribe. <br/>Do you guys have a goat? You have a coat. <br/>If I catch that thing, it is dead. Hopefully jess and I being more grounded and more southle with  the way we speak and the way we do things can help. <br/>I’m so happy. This is awesome. <br/>So are we doing that? <br/>Yes. <br/>Even though we have numbers. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>No contest. <br/>Taylor thinks because we have the numbers that we can be  out in the open. No, sorry, Taylor. I love you the piece, but being with these new people, that's  going to put a target on our backs, so it's not smart. <br/>Does it really matter, though in. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>That matters? <br/>Uh-huh. Trust me. <br/>I trust you. I think it's stupid. <br/>Get over it. <br/>You know you're going to do what she says. <br/>Figs doesn't want anything to do with me. She's like, stay away from me, stay away from me, but I really  think that us being a power couple isn't any different than two people in an  alliance that really trust each other. <br/>That's perfect. Love it. <br/>I was thinking of boil  these separate. <br/>Okay. <br/>Just to soften them, and then I'll stir-fry the rest. <br/>Sounds great to me. <br/>Getting swapped into a tribe with only Taylor and Figgy  from my original millennial tribe is my worst nightmare. Figgy is very controlling. She lies constantly, and she's going to go through this charade  as long as she can about how they are not a couple. I don't know how long that will last, because Taylor is ready to  start ca noodling again. To me that's a worthless partnership. <br/>How did you feel over there, man? Were you toward the top, toward the bottom? <br/>Right around down here. <br/>Bottom third? <br/>You could definitely say that. <br/>Why's that? <br/>Just ask about the first vote. <br/>Was your name also up there? <br/>No, but Figgy's was. <br/>And that was you. Were you the only one to put her name down? <br/>Me and Zeke and Mari. <br/>Adam is super nice. I feel like I hit the jackpot. I got your back, man. Shake it off. <br/>Thanks, man. <br/>Ken and Jessica, they seem to have a tight bond, and I know  that Figgy and Taylor won't turn on each other, so I have pairs on both sides  of me. I'm the guy they need to come. To I’m the guy they need to work with. I get to decide which side moves forward. <br/>Did you dream this? <br/>I don't dream. I have no dreams. I very, very rarely remember a dream. Moistly just sort of wake up. <br/>Morning, Michelle. <br/>Morning. <br/>Morning. <br/>What about you? Do you dream? <br/>This is the first time I think I had a dream since we got  here. <br/>So you actually slept. <br/>How did imru sleep? <br/>Not too good. My whole game was turned upside down. I happen to be on the only tribe with the minority millennials,  just me and Zeke, and three gen-xers. Are you guys thinking we should slow cook the beans? <br/>I’m not that hungry. I'm a little worried if we have challenge we won't have time the  cook the beans. My problem is that the alliance might be stacked against me. So I’m definitely scared. <br/>You got it, dave. <br/>I missed where y'all are  from? <br/>Oklahoma. <br/>I’m from edmund. <br/>We're the ocean boys. He's sooner nation. <br/>Pennsylvania. <br/>Did you play for the sooners? <br/>Yeah. <br/>What coach did you play for? <br/>Two years of blake, two years of stoop. <br/>You're on the national championship in. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You didn't bring your ring? <br/>No ring out here. <br/>You can't lose a national championship ring. <br/>You don't want to do that. That was a good year. <br/>Zeke's an oklahoma boy, just like me, grew up in oklahoma,  probably an hour and a half from where I grew up. He's a big sooner fan. Of course, I played on the last national championship, so we  have that connection immediately. I'm all broKen down. It hurts, man. <br/>I am feeling better on  this new tribe than I did at the end of the gen-x, because here I feel like I  have a tad bit more control over my decision about how I’m going to play the  game. <br/>Hey, I want you to know right up front, y'all got a chance  because me and you need to talk before anything just because there's three of  us doesn't mean anything. Don't think you're just out, because I’m ready to make a move. <br/>Chris played for my team, university of oklahoma sooners. Not only did he play for the sooners, he was on the 2000  national championship team. These guys are my childhood heroes. That national championship was one of the biggest events of my  childhood. <br/>I got a game plan. We can hash it out together and see what's best, because right  now I guarantee those two are going to vote you all out, and I got some  different plans. <br/>All right. <br/>Who do I want to work with? I want to work with the big ginger-haired football player who  says, buddy, don't worry, things are not what they seem. You are not on the bottom, and I want to work with you. It's like the heavens opened and the lights shined down and finally  I catch a break in this game. Finally I catch a break in this game. So we wake up this morning. We don't have a fire yet, and I’m starving and I’m thirsty. <br/>There you go. <br/>I don't understand. <br/>I’m trying the use the  flint. I'm exhausted. I'm trying. I'm trying. It just does not work for me, and I don't understand why. I'm just losing all hope. I'm like, you know what, forget this. <br/>Have at it. <br/>The fire got to a point where Jay gave up. I was exhausted, but I was like, fire is necessary to our life  in the game. So I started trying. Deeper down, like there is this theme in my life that sometimes  I get to a point where I've given it all that I have and am almost to the  point of giving up, and then I push a little further and things pop. I work for things, working to put my own self to college,  working to pay off my own loans. I work. <br/>That's fire. There it is. There it is. Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice! Keep it going. <br/>I hope it works. Come on. <br/>Michaela said, let me try. She went berserk and all these sparks start coming out. Next thing you know, boom. We were psyched. I was psyched for her. There you go. Keep it going. Michaela, awesome! Man, it really brought us all back the life. It was a great moment because, you know, she saved us today. It was really kind of emotional for her. <br/>I’m normally not a person  to cry, but sometimes you just need something so bad. Sometimes when you have no other choice but to get something  done, it happens, and it just is letting me know, like the life I’m trying to  get by winning this thing is worth it. I do want it badly for my family. There's nobody in my family that's been able to have success and  keep it. You know, it's like everybody got some type of problem, and I just  want to prove that you can have success and you can have your family  together. <br/>Michaela, you're a hero! <br/>Michaela. <br/>Michaela! <br/>Ekaboula. <br/>Is that awesome or what? <br/>I’m trying. <br/>You should be crying because you just saved us. <br/>You should be proud. <br/>None of us could do that and you got it done. <br/>Michaela saved the day. <br/>Jeff: All right. You guys ready to get to your first immunity immunity challeng  new tribe? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First things first, Zeke, need it back. <br/>Yep. <br/>Jeff: Wow. Nice toss. Once again immunity is back up for grabs, and today two tribes  will win immunity. Here's how it works. For today's challenge, you're going to dive down, retrieve a  buoy, and swim it to the platform. Then next person goes. Once you have collected all five buoys, you have a choice. You can immediately start throwing your buoys, attempting to  land them in the basket, or you can take the time to try to hook your basket,  pulling it much closer, making it easier to score. First two tribes to five win immunity, safe from the vote. Losers, tribal council where somebody will be the fifth person  voted out of this game. Ika bula, you have one extra member. You're going to sit somebody out. Who's it going to be? Will going to sit this one out. Everybody else take a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. For immunity, first two tribes to finish safe from tribal. Losers, somebody will be voted out. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, Sunday. <br/>Jeff: Looking for that first buoy. Adam has it for Takali. <br/>Good job. <br/>Jeff: CeCe has hers for Vanua. <br/>Come on, Sunday. <br/>Jeff: Sunday still working on that but we for ika bula. Sunday going to give up and swim it in. It's going to cost her tribe a lot of time because somebody else  will have to swim twice. It is Adam and CeCe in the lead. Adam is back with the first but we. Go, Takali! Sunday is back. Go, ika bula. Jay in the water for ika bula. Jay making quick time of it. CeCe still working for Vanua. <br/>Keep kicking. <br/>Jeff: Jay is back. Go, ika bula. Jessica back with the second buoy. <br/>Good job. <br/>Jeff: Go, Takali. Michaela quickly with the buoy. <br/>Come on, CeCe, you got it. <br/>Jeff: CeCe is taking forever to get out of the water. <br/>Put it up there, CeCe. Just put it up there and get up. <br/>Jeff: Go! David now in the water for Vanua. Figgy making good time. <br/>Good job, Figgy. <br/>Jeff: Michaela now coming back. Go, ika bula. Go, Takali. David has a buoy for Vanua. Now David has to get out of the water. Ken with a buoy. Hannah has hers for ika bula. Ken is back. <br/>In the basket. <br/>Jeff: Go, Takali. <br/>There we go. <br/>Jeff: David's struggling. <br/>Come on, David, put it on the deck. <br/>Jeff: David cannot get out of the water with the buoy. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Christa: A huge set back for Vanua. <br/>Get it rpg David! <br/>Jeff: And now David loses the buoy. He's got to get back in the water. Disaster. <br/>David, get it. <br/>Jeff: Hannah back now. Go, ika bula. <br/>Is he throwing this? <br/>Jeff: Takali has all five. You can start shooting. Ken now going to try to retrieve his basket and pull it closer. David absolutely out of gas, and he's lost the buoy again. Go! Ika bula still has another buoy in the water. They're going to to swim all the way back, get on the platt form  and go again. Ken going for it, but he's all knotted up. That lead is evaporating. Jay a monster in the water. <br/>Come on, Jay. Come on, Jay. <br/>Jeff: Michelle trying to get a buoy. <br/>Michelle, go. <br/>Jeff: And she can't get a bow we. Jay is now back with fifth buoy. Ken with the great lasso. He's pulling it closer. Michaela going to try to lasso that basket and pull it closer. No. Ken is now shooting. <br/>Right there, right there, Ken. <br/>Jeff: Chris is back with that third buoy. Go, Zeke. Zeke now in the water. Slips off the platform. Takali has had a lead the entire challenge, but Ken has not yet  scored. Ken in and out. Zeke is now back. They're still one buoy short. Got to go all the way back and come back and get the buoy. Can they make up the time they need to get in this? <br/>Come on, Michaela. <br/>Jeff: Ken misses again. Michaela hooks it for ika bula. She's pulling it closer. We've got a challenge. Bret is in the water. Hannah in the water. Michaela scores on her first shot. It is now ika bula in the lead. Michaela 2-2, incredible. Oh, in and out. It is now ika bula in the lead. Ken now scores for Takali. <br/>There you go. <br/>Way to go. <br/>Jeff: Chris is back. Let's go. What's the decision? Vanua going to just start shooting. There goes Chris from a long ways away. Can Chris find the distance? <br/>Michaela, take your time. Michaela with a third for ika bula. <br/>There we go. <br/>She's been on fire. Michaela with four for ika bula. <br/>You got it, you got it. <br/>Jeff: No. Chris short again. <br/>Don't get nervous. Just do it. <br/>Jeff: Michaela for the win. Michaela for the win! Yes. Ika bula wins immunity. We are looking for second place. <br/>Let's try the pull it in, Zeke. <br/>Jeff: Michelle coming out of the water. Zeke coming back out of the water. They're going to go back the trying the lasso their target and  bring it closer. After being dead last the entire challenge, Vanua is still in  it. It is everybody's game right now for second. Ken with the second point for Takali. <br/>Come on. Don't stop. <br/>Jeff: Ken with the third for Takali. <br/>There you go. <br/>Jeff: He's on a hot streak now. Ken for four. No. It is a battle for the second immunity. Chris lassos it for Vanua. Their target is much closer. Will it make a difference? Frustration setting in for Vanua. Takali has had a gigantic lead. Ken with the fourth. Ken needs one more to secure immunity for the win. There it is! Takali wins immunity sending Vanua to tribal council. Ika bula, congratulations. Somebody swim over and get it. Mice job. Takali, send somebody over to get it. Nice entry. Give you a ten. Nobody going home from ika bula. Nobody going home from Takali. You will live to see another day in this game. Grab your stuff, swim on out, enjoy it. <br/>Cannonball! <br/>Jeff: All right, guys. At the present time with me tonight, tribal council. Somebody from this five will be voted out. Swim it in. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>I’m frustrated because CeCe  and David are just atrocious in challenges, and they don't even seem the care  because they have the numbers, but thankfully Chris is trying to make a move,  and if he does, a gen-xer goes home regardless. <br/>That sucks. <br/>He was tired. <br/>I threw it on the basket. <br/>I’m sorry about the buoy. That just wasn't our best day. <br/>We gave it our best shot. <br/>Yeah. <br/>This is like a nightmare, a recurring nightmare. It's like I go to sleep, I wake up and I’m in the same  nightmare, back the tribal council. The one positive is finally I’m not on the bottom. <br/>I'll get some firewood. <br/>This time we have the majority, three gen-x against two  millennials, so either Michelle or Zeke will be voted off. Zeke can do puzzles and he's still strong, he's still pretty  decent in the water. <br/>No, he's pretty good. He's strong in the water. <br/>He's strong. <br/>He's been pretty open about whatever you all want. <br/>Do we tell him we're voting for Michelle? <br/>Why don't we tell him. <br/>We don't take any chances. <br/>Huge night tonight. This is a personal decision. And quite honestly, I've made a different decision. <br/>Let's just do it. <br/>CeCe and dave backstabbed me, and one of them has to go  today. Dave bit me in the butt a couple time, but he has at least some  numbers that will survive this three-tribe situation that we're in. I have to have a big alliance to protect me in a merge, so we're  going to vote CeCe off tonight. <br/>Hey. Me and you need to sit down and really dig through this. We can't get rid of Zeke. We need to think this thing through tonight. This is a pivotal moment. If we make the wrong move...  You thinking CeCe? <br/>Well, I don't want to. <br/>Right. <br/>But we're kind of decimated here. <br/>It sounds like Chris wants to vote out CeCe, and I’m extremely  nervous about that. Chris has on his side Zeke and Michelle, so I think I should  just go along with the plan and make him believe he can trust me. <br/>So it's CeCe? I'll do it, I swear the God I'll do it. <br/>I want you to think it  through. <br/>I don't even need. To. <br/>If we can come together, we can benefit each other. <br/>If dave will stay to his word or not, I don't know. I'm trusting a guy that's burnt me tries. <br/>Once CeCe's gone, it's Christmas. <br/>You're safe tonight, both of you. <br/>Thank you guys. <br/>You guys are awesome. <br/>David and Chris say it's not you, we're voting CeCe. How do you trust it? <br/>No matter what is said at tribal, vote for CeCe. <br/>And if it's not, I’m going to be the first one to ever  choke David in front of national tv. <br/>There's a thousand possibilities he's not telling the  truth. I'm not going to sit become and let other people decide my fate  because that's not how I’m used to doing things. <br/>I feel so defeated. <br/>It's so tough, you know? <br/>This game is just like... You know that I know that it's  either me or you probably. But I know I have great upper body strength, I’m great with  puzzles. I just don't see a benefit in keeping dave. <br/>You definitely have a point. <br/>You know since we're on the bottom, we're willing to make  a deal. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>I tried to talk strategy  with her, and I can't get anywhere. So all I can do right now is hope that David and Chris are  telling me the truth and hope for the best. <br/>She wants to vote you out. <br/>Vote me out? Why does she want to vote me out? <br/>Because you're the weakest and you're clumsy. <br/>That's what every girl says about me? <br/>Chris and I talked, and we've decided that we'd work with  the millennials to vote for CeCe. But I really don't trust Michelle. She wanted to woo CeCe over and target me. Once CeCe is gone, I would be the weakest person of our tribe,  and I worry that Chris, Michelle and Zeke could form a voting bloc and vote  me out in the next tribal. And it's got me thinking whether or not I should give my idol to  CeCe and then vote off Michelle? I play a lot of chess, and the thing about chess, if you're  going to my a good game, you have to look as many moves ahead as you can. And if it means betraying an alliance or people that trust you,  do it. <br/>Jeff: All right. So let's talk about the challenge today. Zeke, this is your first challenge as a new tribe. What were the stakes? <br/>Well, I think for Michelle and I, we see that we're  clearly on the bottom. We know that the millennials are dominating the other two  tribes. We both ended up here, one or two of us is going home. <br/>Jeff: David, when you have a three and a two, there's  always one idea, which is who is three on the three? Who is the bottom? Because we'll make you top over here. <br/>That's always an option, but I do feel the gen-x three  sitting up here tonight are very strong, and I don't think any of us have the  insecurity that we're on the bottom, but of course that can't possibly be  true. <br/>Jeff: Zeke, there it is. You talk about being the bottom, you can be the top if you can  get one of these three to join you. That's the trick. I know it's intimidating. I know you don't want to work with a millennial because you see  a massive millennial advantage, but you're not going to move further in this  game without connections to millennials, and I provide that, and I’m ready to  make a move with the gen-xers if that's what I need to do. <br/>Jeff: Chris, "Survivor" is a big game with a lot  of moving parts, and the thought that all the millennials are going to stick  together while on three separate tribes right now could be foolish. <br/>I don't think they're  going to stick together, but you can't be unaware of the situation. Gen-x is down numbers, and we do need millennials to help going  forward. <br/>Jeff: But did you feel Michelle or Zeke trying to work David,  CeCe and yourself? <br/>You bet. You bet. They haven't given up, that's for sure. And I talked a lot with Zeke. We're beth oklahoma boys. He's a big sooner fan, and, of course, I played. I have a lot in common with Zeke, which may surprise people, the  big country boy and the new york kid. <br/>Christa: CeCe, what level of concern do you have when you  see one of your three gen-xers, Chris, talking with Zeke? <br/>It definitely raises concerns. You know, going forward, Chris may be willing to vote out a  gen-x to save Zeke. <br/>Jeff: Chris, it sounds like this is a question of when  does the game play begin? <br/>The last two tribals I've been to, I've been blind sided,  so this vote tonight is a chance for us to build back a really strong bond  and be really close. <br/>Jeff: David, has there been talk about previous tribals  and what may or may not have happened? <br/>Yes, there has been. I do understand Chris's concerns about whether or not he can  trust me, and we actually talked about that today. Trust is paramount tonight, and I keep finding myself in the  position of having to prove my loyalty, and I owe him that, and tonight I’m going  to do that. <br/>Jeff: Chris, the other specific thing David said was that  he needs the prove his trust. You understand that? <br/>Yes, David, he got me a couple times, and I don't like to  be reckless or anything, but sometimes you got to take a risk, and I’m taking  a risk on David tonight, but I specifically told him, if you do it again, I better  be sitting right up there tonight. <br/>I think you said you're  going to choke me. <br/>I might have said that,  too, but I was kidding on that. <br/>Jeff: Michelle, that is the best thing you can hope to  hear is that there were problems in that group. <br/>Yes. I personally don't see how there could be very much trust there. Especially continuing forward. I just wonder why would you want the try to work with someone  who has blind sided you twice. <br/>Jeff: Who do you think should be voted out tonight? <br/>I think I would put out David. <br/>This is fun. <br/>Jeff: David, it can't surprise you, though. If you're sitting in their seat, you got to get that vote off  your shoulder on to somebody else's. <br/>Understandably, but I think if the gen-x three sitting  here tonight are truly united, we have nothing to worry about. <br/>Jeff: Okay. It is time to vote. CeCe, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked the leave the tribal council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote Michelle. CeCe. One vote Michelle, one vote CeCe. CeCe. That's two votes CeCe, one vote Michelle. Fifth person voted out, CeCe. That's three, that's enough, you need to bring me your torch. That's three, that's enough, you need to bring me your torch. CeCe, the tribe has spoKen. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Jeff: Well, if there's one thing this group of four can  take comfort in, it's knowing you can trust each other, unless, of course,  you're the one being lied to. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor," Figgy lets her  guard down. <br/>Taylor and I kind of have a thing. <br/>You think? <br/>It's obvious. <br/>Jeff: While a challenge leaves the Survivors spinning. <br/>Sunday getting dizzy now. Medical. <br/>You're not going to let me die. <br/>It's insane. <br/>I was blind sided. My two fellow gen-xers voted against me, and going forward  they're going the lose. I think it was the dumbest mistake they made. I feel betrayed, but I played as hard as I could. I strategized. I snuck in, and I absolutely believe my kids are going to be  very proud how far I came in the game and that I did my best.
