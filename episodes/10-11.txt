<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor:  What are we, junior high, Katie? <br/>Probst: Janu was fed up with her tribe. <br/>If I had something to say about you, I swear to God I  would come up and say it to your face. <br/>Janu is crazy. She's a crazy person. <br/>Probst: Survivors ready. At the reward challenge... Go! ...the tribe was randomly split into two teams of four... Janu  going out to help. ...and battled for the chance to partake in a traditional  Palauan feast. Janu, Tom, Caryn, Gregg win reward. [ cheering ] And all talk of strategy was put on hold as they  shared in a feast of local delicacies. <br/>Oh, my gosh, barbecue. <br/>Probst: Back at camp, Stephenie realized immunity was more  important than ever. <br/>I definitely need immunity because apparently I'm the  strongest girl, and I'm just as much as a threat as any of the guys. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge... You'll all take a  spot in the water. As the tide begins to rise, your breathing room will decrease. One more thing-- first person to bail on this challenge will be  taken to a new beach and abandoned there. Begin. After a short struggle, it was Janu that dropped out first. Just like that, Janu is out. And in the end Tom walked away with the immunity necklace. That's it. Tom wins immunity. Left alone to fend for herself, Janu struggled with obstacles  she had never faced before. <br/>This is very hard, and it's very frustrating. <br/>Probst: But she surprised herself and her mood lifted. <br/>Right now I'm really happy. The moon and my fire. <br/>Probst: Back at camp...  Stephenie is a bigger threat than Janu. <br/>Probst: ...Gregg led the charge to keep Janu and vote out  Stephenie. <br/>Stephenie is a physical threat. She's got a strong will, she wants to win this game. <br/>We all agreed it was Janu tonight, but for some reason I  have a feeling it's me. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Stephenie's worst fears were  realized when it became clear that she was next to go. <br/>The game is on and eliminating competition is part of this  game. <br/>Probst: Stephenie, do you feel you're in a hot seat  tonight? <br/>[ crying ]: I know I am. I guess I showed too much heart and too much will. <br/>Probst: But Janu threw a wrench in the tribe's plan. <br/>I would be willing to lay down my torch so Stephenie can  have a chance to stay in the game. <br/>Probst: Janu, per your wishes, this game is over for you,  but you will not go home, you'll return and be a part of our jury. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Seven are left. <br/>Probst: Seven are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? [theme song playing] [theme song playing] [theme song playing] What the hell was that? <br/>When I got back, I felt a little uncomfortable. It's just wrong that they were going to vote me out and this  girl that doesn't even want to be here, Janu, they're gonna keep around, just  because she's easy, you know, later? I'm getting pissed off now. She's not around, she's basically saying, "I don't want to  be here." And she's sitting here saying... I don't know what the hell she  was saying. I couldn't stop her. I don't know who to trust. I don't know who to talk to. I almost don't want to talk to anybody. I'm not going to shoot myself in the foot, though. <br/>But you know what? Let me tell you. It would have gone the same way. She would have been going home. <br/>You think? <br/>After what happened. <br/>I didn't think so. Really? <br/>We came back to camp. Tom played it off like, "Hey, you know what? We were gonna change our vote," and it was just, like, you  know, comfort Stephenie, make sure that she feels welcome and not disrupt  tribe camp. <br/>I would like to point something out. My immunity became a moot point tonight since it wasn't used,  but somebody did earn their own immunity. That self-preservation speech. So for tonight, that's yours. <br/>Oh, stop it. I didn't earn this. <br/>Katie, Tom, myself and Ian, we had a four-strong alliance  and now all of a sudden all the tables are turning and I'm, like,  "What's going on? Who's switching?" I don't know, but whether I go next or  not, I will get to the bottom of it beforehand. bottom of it beforehand. <br/>That was ridiculous. <br/>That was ridiculous. <br/>I'm upset by the fact that we didn't vote Stephenie out  when we should have, which is the first round, and by keeping her around, she  influences the team dynamic and it scares me because Stephenie progressing in  this game means that Koror falls apart and starts to stab falls apart and  starts to stab each other in the back. each other in the back. <br/>So, is the four strong gone? Is that... The original four-- me, you, Tom and Ian. I mean, who's running the show here, Gregg or Ian? Not me. Somebody is. Katie acts like she's my friend and I can trust her. And then I go to talk to her, and she's, like, "I don't  know, I don't know who's leading." She won't tell me anything, so I need  to talk to Tom. <br/>You know, this game keeps getting shaken up, and you know  that. <br/>I know. <br/>The promise I made you on day two was that we'd try to  ride this, but if we got split up, we'd look out for each other. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I swear, I'm still trying to look out for you. <br/>That was totally what...  I just can't expose myself. <br/>Mm-mm. <br/>But I'm just, I'm looking for an opening. <br/>You're showing yourself way too much as a survivor, is  what you are. But, um...  Yeah. It just pissed me off to make it this far...  I'm looking for a chink in the armor. <br/>I know. <br/>There's a reason why Stephenie has survived as long as she  has. She's got great instincts. I really see her as one of the supreme players. Now she's looking for her way, though, to stay in the game,  being the true survivor that she has demonstrated herself to be, um... she's  going to start working on things and that's a problem. Probably the safest thing for all is for Stephenie to leave. <br/>It sucks, you know? It's scary. <br/>I know. <br/>It's a scary feeling. <br/>I think I'm in the same position where I'm gonna be the  threat and they're gonna come after me. I've said this to a few people, we're all here. I'll say it again. I'm pleading for my life, before we even get to that stage of  the game, but my strength in the challenges, it's part of what got us to this  point. Don't penalize it because I didn't hide it. And nobody has won the million dollars who's been a strong  winner of any of those rewards. It's always, always somebody else. I'm just saying, keep that in mind. Don't just, I mean, don't give me the "Tom's a threat, we  got to get rid of him" line. I'd hate to go under those terms. I said, "Listen, my game was revealed because I was playing  real hard for the tribe." I said, "Don't hold it against me now and  don't make me pay for coming out so strong early." All right, I think  we're of one mind. And I'm just hoping that these people don't hold it against me  to that level that, uh, I'm to that level that, uh, I'm finished. finished. <br/>What'd you guys think of his little plea this morning? <br/>Mm...  Kind of...  I'm not sure it was that encouraging. <br/>It totally, it totally, I mean... The fact that he's  winning totally makes him a target. <br/>I know, and he's, like, "Don't make it. No one has ever won..."  There's a reason that no one's ever won. <br/>Right. <br/>Because they get voted off. <br/>Right. Exactly. <br/>Tom's plea, that did nothing. The plea, you know, "Oh, I brought this tribe," you  know? "Helped this tribe get as far as we got," you know? Yeah, whatever-- you're the one that said it's an individual  game now. So that's what we're playing, buddy, sorry. I know that I'm aligned with people that are really good, so to  go up against people that are really good in the game, that's a challenge for  me. If any time, this would be the If any time, this would be the  time to switch over. time to switch over. <br/>Would you really want to do that to Gregg? <br/>To get farther, I mean...  The person we really need to talk to is Caryn, 'cause she  could end up going with them. I think it's an awesome idea. <br/>It'd be crazy. <br/>They're already outnumbered. <br/>Jenn and Steph and I discussed the fact that we have four  women and three men here, so we were just kind of entertaining the thought  that maybe if we all got together, we could have some power here. <br/>But we haven't talked to Caryn about it, so now I have to  discuss it with her. Say you've got immunity. Who would be the first one you Who would be the first one you  would want off? would want off? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I'll do it if you guys are game. [ all talking at once ] I... I don't think I'm that big of a  threat. No matter how threatening you think I am, those three men are  more threatening, and, um... if I get voted out next, no matter what kind of  relationships they think they have, when it comes to a million dollars, you  can think you have the best relationship in the world, doesn't matter. in the world, doesn't matter. Those guys will take you out. Those guys will take you out. <br/>Food. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I can be a good persuader, manipulator, so I work my  angles when I can and I hope I've shown them all. Really. You want, you want to think I'm a threat? I'll show you how threatening I I'll show you how threatening I  am. am. <br/>Tree mail, anyone? <br/>Tree mail! All right! <br/>"The rewards you play for today mostly involve eating  and drinking. The only way to the good stuff will involve strategic  thinking."  Oh, my God. <br/>Maybe we get money and we buy stuff. <br/>A tree mail came in a little... it looks like a purse or  a-a money folder, and we really think today might be the day where they give  you "X" amount of money and we get to spend it on, mostly, food and  drinks. So the fact that it says "mostly" to me means that  there may be some other things. Right now I think I need a little food for the soul, and, uh...  anything from home uh... anything from home would-would serve that purpose. would-would serve that purpose. <br/>Probst: Take a seat. Find your name and sit next to the wallet. Everybody's got a wallet. You've got $500 inside. <br/>Oh, wow. For real. <br/>Oh, wow! It's real money. <br/>Probst: U.S. currency, same currency used here in Palau. That is yours. You can leave here with it, or you can spend it at the Survivor  auction. I'm going to bring up a series of items. Bidding will start at $20 and it will raise in increments of  $20. The auction will stop without warning so if you see something  you like, you better bid on it and not hope for something better to come up  later. Clear? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Get to the first item. <br/>Oh, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun. <br/>Probst: There it is. <br/>You're not going to show us. <br/>Probst: No, it's covered.

[ sniffing ] [ women whispering ]  Uh...  Probst: What do you want? <br/>This one. We're gonna trade. <br/>Probst: You're going to trade this, which you bought, for  this. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Here's what you bought, crackers and cheese. <br/>I love crackers and cheese. <br/>Probst: But, using your senses, which are so acute out  here, you made the right choice.

Take a bite of this. <br/>Can we cut it in half? <br/>Probst: Yeah. <br/>Oh, it's a double. <br/>I'm so glad I smelled, Stephie. <br/>Yeah, you did great.

[ Stephenie laughing ] [ Stephenie laughing ]  Connor's hand. This is what I needed. This is my nourishment, and it was money well spent. <br/>Probst: $220 is what it cost Tom to get his letter from  home. Anybody else wants theirs for the same price, you can have it. <br/>I'll take it. <br/>I'll take it. <br/>I'll take mine. <br/>Probst: Letter from home for Caryn. There you go. Enjoy. <br/>Thank you. Oh. Thanks. <br/>Probst: A lot of good stuff in there. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, geez. <br/>Oh, geez. I got to read it later. <br/>Probst: You just peeked inside. <br/>My whole family. My boyfriend. I can't read it now. I'll lose it. <br/>Probst: This auction is over. <br/>Yes! <br/>No cheese and crackers? <br/>Probst: We're done. The game is back on. Head on back to camp. <br/>Thanks, Jeff! <br/>Thanks! <br/>Probst: See you. <br/>Nice spending time with you. <br/>Probst: Yeah. One of the few days you like me. One of the few days you like me. <br/>You're right. <br/>You're right. <br/>Great reward challenge. Got letters from our families. I have letters from all four of my brothers, my sister-in-law. My beautiful nieces and nephews, my parents, my boyfriend. I have, like, 12 letters. I come from a great family, strong group of people who have  always been positive and very motivational and that's why I am the way I am  and it just makes me try all the harder just to stay in this game. I feel like I've conquered so much, but I want it all. I mean, there's been talk, us girls may get together, but you  can't trust anybody. Having these letters is all the food and all the energy I need  because I will read these letters and I will think of these people, and I'll  go in there like wildfire and I will win this. I know it. <br/>I'm taking a bath. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Heard it before. <br/>Believe it when we see it. Hey, hey, hey. <br/>Jeff commented that I reek pretty bad, so today is bath  day, in honor of Jeff Probst, who noted that I definitely who noted that I  definitely stink. stink. I may need you to help me out. <br/>With what, your back? <br/>Yeah. I just can't see it. I have long, monkey arms, but I couldn't get all the dirt off my  back so I asked Gregg to help me out. Thanks, buddy. <br/>Filthy, dude. <br/>Is it coming off? <br/>The picture out there with the men bathing each other,  loofahing. I think it's pretty comical. I think they could have asked a girl to loofah their backs if  they wanted to. <br/>So Ian and Gregg had a little moment out in the water. Maybe that's the secret alliance we don't know about. You never know. <br/>Thanks, dude. Had a Grecian bath. I think we were totally made fun of for that one, but I'm  comfortable with my sexuality. It's not a big deal. Hey, can you check my neck and just make sure there's no, like,  real big brown spots back there. <br/>No, there are and I'm not going to clean it for you. But you look nice and clean. But you look nice and clean. <br/>Good. <br/>Good. <br/>I know that the target's on me, I know that that's coming. I'm anything but confident in the game. I just, you know, right now I'm in an okay position, but that's  going to change this afternoon. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>So this is... I mean, you have this alliance and it gets  you through to the end, but you think Ian wants to deal with me? You think I want to deal with Ian? <br/>Right. <br/>I know that a lot of the tribe members are going to be,  like, "This may be our last chance to take him out. Let's do it right now." So I'm prepared for that. My only protection is to keep the five tight, and I've also got  to bring in Caryn as a confidante. If there's a little trouble brewing for me, I want Caryn to  think that I'm looking out for her interests, she's looking out for mine. And I know that the target's on me. I still think your good move would be to be, like you say,  there's a strong five, be the strong sixth yourself with us. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Talk to me before you make that jump. <br/>Tom is my in right now, and Tom said to me, "Caryn,  I'm going to watch you as long as I can." He said, "I want you to  go as far as you can." I feel like you've worked really hard to keep me  in the game. I'm just not going to bite the hand that's been feeding me. <br/>All right, well, I appreciate that. I think we do have some kind of a sympathetic thing going where  we're going to look out for each other for the best that we can. <br/>Right. <br/>So it was a good move on my part to be friends with Caryn. What happens, happens at this point. You know, you just, you play your cards as best you can. If I don't win the immunity challenge, I'll be ready to see  challenge, I'll be ready to see my name written a few times. my name written a few times. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Probst: Okay. Let's get to today's immunity challenge. First things first, Tom. First things first, Tom. Give it up. Give it up. Immunity once again back up for grabs. For today's immunity challenge, you're going to be up on a  platform. 20 feet away is a wooden grid. On that grid-- ceramic tiles. There are 35 tiles-- that's five tiles for each of you. Using coconuts, you're going to toss the coconut and attempt to  knock out one of your tiles. If you take out somebody else's tile, that counts for them. First person to break all five of their tiles or have their  tiles broken by somebody else wins immunity. Lose, Tribal Council tonight. This game will end for somebody. We'll randomly draw for colors. Get your names up on the board and we'll get started. All right, Ian. You're in the number one slot, going for red. Choose your weapon. [ sighs ] [ sighs ] Goes small.

Probst: For yellow. <br/>Come on. <br/>Probst: Aw... [ yells ]  Probst: Nothing. At the end of two rounds Ian in the lead with three, Katie,  Caryn, Tom with two, Gregg and Jenn with one, Stephenie still at zero. at zero. Ian going for red. Ian going for red.

Gregg with one, looking to get his second. He's going for blue. Look at that. Drilled it. Gregg now with two. Jenn is up. Jenn going for orange. There it is. There it is! <br/>All right, good shot. <br/>Probst: Nicely done. Jenn with three. Caryn going for white, sitting on two and she takes out...

Going for green... and he does it. <br/>Tom's getting good at this. <br/>Probst: Tom now on the board with three. Steph going for the corner yellow. Just misses. <br/>Second time in a row, same spot. <br/>Probst: End of three rounds, Ian in the lead with four,  Tom, Jenn with three, Gregg, Katie, Caryn with two, Steph with one.

Katie takes out her own, now with three. Gregg sitting on two. Wants to stay in this. Looking at blue. Look at that. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: Dead on. Gregg now with three. He's back in this game. He's back in this game. Jenn sitting on three. Jenn sitting on three. Oh! Oh! Hit three tiles and none of them went out. Ian hoping somebody will accidentally take him out, he'll win  it. Caryn going for white. <br/>Ooh, short. <br/>Bad toss. <br/>Probst: Tom with three. Could move him into a tie with Ian for first. Going for green. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: And instead he takes out red which is Ian. Ian wins immunity. <br/>Thank you. Thank you guys. <br/>Damn. <br/>Probst: Steph, your toss doesn't count. Nobody can catch Ian. Congratulations. Ian safe from the vote tonight. Everybody else fair game. Everybody else fair game. I'll see you at Tribal. I'll see you at Tribal. I'll see you at Tribal. [ thunder ] [ thunder ]  So mother nature throws this little curveball and, you  know, we're gonna have a rainy day. So I think it would be very funny if the sun breaks out and you  just see seven people scatter out of the tent in individual groups just going  to explode with the things that are building up inside them while we're stuck  inside. while we're stuck inside. It's going to be a fun day. It's going to be a fun day. <br/>The girls want to vote the guys out one by one, so I think  they're just going to tell Caryn. So I'm, like, are they really going take me and us four really  take out the three men? We'll see. <br/>Stick with the women and take out the men, or go with the  men and take the rest of them, kicking our ass in a big way? We have four and they have three. I hate to do it, but I knew I'd have to jump ship at some point. I just didn't know when it would be. <br/>Katie asked me if I wanted to make an alliance with the  girls. She said, "There's four of us and three of them and now is  the time to do it."  And then we'll just see how it works out from there. <br/>Right. <br/>You know, I love Tom. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I will cry when I have to write his name down. <br/>Me, too. <br/>But I've accepted that I'm going to have to write his name  down or else he's going to win. <br/>I really have to think it through, I mean... I've been  down with Tom, so this is a whole new thing that I really have to think  about. I mean, I don't have, like, the word "alliance" with  anybody. I'm watching out for Tom. Tom is watching out for me. <br/>What's going on? <br/>I just told you I would tell you if your name came up and  your name is coming up all over the place. <br/>What's going on? <br/>Um...  What do you hear? <br/>Just that the girls are talking. <br/>What do the girls say? <br/>Trying to figure out which guy to take out. <br/>And why are you telling me, as opposed to siding with the  girls? <br/>Because I told you I would. <br/>Mm-hmm. I understand that, just, but, I mean, you also have to protect  your own neck. You know that you're safer with me, you must. <br/>[ stammering ]: I'm just telling you because I promised  you I would tell you. If I heard anything about you I said I'd tell you. <br/>Well, that was Caryn just letting me know that the girls  are talking about eliminating some of the guys and that my name popped up. I'm still just a little wary of why Caryn's giving me the  information, you know, she'd be better off holding on to that information and  just surprising me. And Katie said she's ready for me to go? <br/>She's not sure. She was just talking. She was just throwing around possible scenarios. <br/>Okay. It's an interesting day here. I've got to get off with Ian, I've got to get off with Ian, do a  little planning there, too. do a little planning there, too. <br/>I think everybody's starting to play the game and Caryn's  kind of telling stories to everybody and trying to get a way into a situation  where she can be on top. So my mind's going about four-and-a-half miles a minute and I'm  trying to figure out and I'm trying to figure out what the next best move is. what the next best move is. <br/>Caryn's spreading that you're trying to get all the girls  against the guys. <br/>I don't know what the [bleep] you're saying. <br/>I'm, I'm strong. Listen, Caryn's spreading a lie. I'm getting really pissed off. <br/>I don't like that. I don't like that she just did that at all. That really bothers me. Caryn went back and told Tom I was planning to get all the  women, which is not what I was doing. I was just entertaining the thought, but we can't get a female  alliance together because Caryn sucks. <br/>I can go Caryn first. You think it would be better to get rid of Caryn than Tom? <br/>You don't have a chance. I don't have a chance against Tom, I don't think I have a chance  against you either, but I'm sticking with you. If I can avoid writing your name down until the end, I'm good  with that. <br/>I'm, I'm still 100% true to you, like...  Yeah, me, too. I-I just feel really bad about the Tom thing, if you think about  it. We should take out Tom. I believe Tom stands a huge, good chance that he can win every  immunity from here on out, 'cause he's smart and he's strong. I just hate for it to be such a sweep and Tom just takes the  whole thing and none of us have a chance. <br/>It's not going to happen that way. <br/>I think the biggest obstacle is getting Ian on my side. And to vote off Tom, I think I can get Ian to do that, I think. Just, I mean, when are you going to be ready to get rid of Tom? 'Cause every time I bring it up, you're like...  Tom realizes that he's the biggest threat and while I kind  of, you know, I kind of comforted him through the whole thing. That's not the whole way it is; for me it's very up in the air. I just want to make sure you're still good to go. <br/>Yeah, absolutely. It's not a question, it's just who I think should go. <br/>We need to fill the bucket. <br/>This is where the game gets really, really difficult. Caryn needs to go home, Stephenie needs to go home, so my big  dilemma today is so my big dilemma today is do I vote Tom out? do I vote Tom out? <br/>I think I'm screwed because I think Ian told Katie that  I'm playing probably both sides of the fence and so I might be in trouble. So, I don't know where I am So, I don't know where I am right  now. right now. <br/>Stephenie needs to go. It's already been too much of a Stephenie show. She brings a complexity to the game right now, and the sooner we  get rid of her, the easier it is for us to go back to what the plan is. Don't mess with the plan. Don't mess with the plan. I'm going to get pissed off. I am going to get so pissed off. <br/>I feel like this whole game I've had stuff hanging over my  head and I've made it through somehow. If these people are smart and they know how to play the game for  themselves, their best bet is to not get rid of me tonight. I've said my peace, I've planted the seed. If they're smart, Tom will be the next one to go. Whether they choose to go with Whether they choose to go with  it, that's on them. it, that's on them. <br/>Probst: We now bring in the members of our jury, Coby and  Janu who quit at the last Tribal Council, but per the rules, will remain a  part of this jury and will have a vote at the final Tribal Council. 30 days in started with 20. We're down to seven. Ian, is the paranoia starting to drift into camp? <br/>Well, it's starting to creep in. I mean, you know, you go to the bathroom and you're, like,  "Hmm, I wonder if anybody's talking about me." But, uh, all in all,  I think it's still a pretty solid group. <br/>Probst: Steph, you narrowly escaped being voted out at  last Tribal Council. What was the reaction when you got back to camp? Because, clearly, this tribe wanted you gone. <br/>I thought it was going to be really uncomfortable, but it  wasn't. I hear that they have their, you know, plans and stuff, but, um,  they made me feel really comfortable. And, unfortunately, I don't have immunity on my neck, but, um,  you know, I'm playing as hard as I can and whatever is meant to happen will  happen for me. <br/>Probst: You're a part of this group, but you're still a  bit of an outsider. What's going to happen to this group as it dwindles and people  start going over to the jury, bitter that they're no longer in this happy  family? <br/>I think it's going to be tough because they haven't really  had to, like, scramble and start, like, kind of backstabbing yet, so it's  really getting intense. Like, people are starting to notice. I mean, I've been stressed out since the first time I came to  Tribal Council, but it's the game. <br/>Probst: Caryn, when did you notice the intensity pick up? <br/>Probably the day after the last Tribal Council. I started noticing more people going off and talking, and, you  know, I think other people have noticed it, too. <br/>Probst: So if it's you tonight, surprised? <br/>Not all that surprised. I could be the next one. You know, you feel like you know what's going on, but at any  given time, I might not know what's going on. <br/>Probst: Tom, seems like from early on, you've been  somewhat of a leader on this tribe. You certainly haven't held back at any of these challenges. Was that a conscious decision to say "I'm going for broke. "I'm going to let them see I'm strong and see how it plays  out"? <br/>No. Uh, my doing well in any of the challenges became happenstance  that I didn't intend. I thought I was going to hide behind being a little older than  the crowd, but the need for Koror to beat Ulong was paramount, so I revealed  my hand. Um, you know, I hope it's not held against me, and I don't mind  that I've come out and played hard, and I'll live with those consequences. <br/>Probst: Okay, Ian, you have the immunity necklace. As always, if you felt compelled, you could give it to somebody  you thought was in trouble. <br/>I'm going, I'm going to keep it for myself tonight, Jeff. <br/>Probst: All right, you cannot vote for Ian. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Caryn, you're up. Caryn, you're up. <br/>You're one of the fiercest competitors I've ever met. competitors I've ever met. My heart hurts to let you go. My heart hurts to let you go. <br/>This is absolutely nothing personal. I'm just voting I'm just voting with the rest of the tribe. with the rest of the tribe. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. The first vote: The first vote: Caryn. Caryn. Steph. One vote Steph, one vote Caryn. Steph. Two votes Steph, one vote Caryn. Steph. That's three votes Steph, one vote Caryn. 12th person voted out and the third member of our jury, Steph. That's four votes. That's enough. Bring me your torch. Bring me your torch. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Probst: Steph, the tribe has spoken. <br/>See ya. <br/>Probst: It's time for you to  Probst: It's time for you to go. go. Well, relatively speaking, another easy vote. Last Tribal Council, somebody quit. This time you vote out the last remaining Ulong member. We are now down to six original Koror members. This happy family's about to be broken up. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. scenes from our next episode. Next time on Survivor:  Today I think my worst fears were realized. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>The next one is the big one. <br/>Probst: And paranoia intensifies. <br/>I know they're ready to turn on you. I know for a fact. <br/>And you think Katie is in with it? <br/>Definitely. <br/>I don't know what the next  I don't know what the next step is. step is. <br/>I'm really psyched and I'm, like, really proud of myself  because it was, it was a hard run. Our whole tribe just got blown away person by person, and here I  am the only one left standing. And I go to this new tribe, thinking I'm a dead man walking, and  I made it one in seven. I was outnumbered by an entire tribe, and I am. tribe, and I am. I'm actually really proud.
