<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: The Kota tribe has enjoyed the benefits  of winning a staggering nine out of 11 challenges against the rapidly dwindling  Fang tribe, but on day 21 both tribes competed for individual immunity. Ace in the water first! Marcus wins individual immunity! And both tribes were sent to Tribal Council. At the Kota Tribal Council, Susie dissed Corinne...  I think I'm stronger than Corinne. <br/>Probst: Corinne not buying that at all. ...and narrowly avoided getting voted out. We're tied, three votes Susie, three votes Dan, one vote left. That honor went to Dan. That honor went to Dan. The tribe has spoken. The tribe has spoken. At the Fang Tribal Council, Sugar surprised everyone by stabbing her closest  ally in the back. With physical force Ace out of the game, Fang needs a miracle to turn things  around. Ten are left. Ten are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>What's so funny? <br/>How was that compared to the other Tribal Councils you had? <br/>Uh, the other ones are easy. [laughter] That wasn't meant to be funny. <br/>No. Yeah, it was tough. <br/>Yeah, I mean, I didn't say it to get people to laugh. Tonight was not fun. That was my friend that left. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You know, think about what I say before you just instantly start laughing,  'cause not all the time I'm trying to be funny. We voted Dan off tonight. Uh, the vote was 4-3. I voted for Susie just in case Dan had the hidden immunity idol and could  have taken anybody he wanted out. He was my friend, but he had to go. <br/>I would like to analyze what our weaknesses are and shore 'em up. Because I personally feel like the merge is coming in the next couple days. <br/>Well, and the way I look at it, operation clean sweep; these six mowing down  that four. You know, this is the heart of who's left, the six of us. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>We can make it happen. <br/>We can't, like... I mean, I'm not trying to call you out, particularly Susie,  but like you can't threaten to vote for Corinne and not tell somebody that  there is a problem there. <br/>Yeah. When you and I had the conversation and you said I wasn't helpful around  camp, you know, I understood that. I'm sensitive to it now. But what I don't understand is during Tribal you had, like, a lot of other  gripes. Prior to going in, Susie told me that she was gonna vote for me based on the  fact that she did not think I did enough work around camp. Well, then we get to Tribal. Who's the weakest player in the game? I think Corinne's weaker than me. I think I swim better than Corinne, I think I have better upper-body strength. The woman is 47 years old. What could she possibly have over me? Look, I'm not really sure that you're not going to vote me out as soon as you  get your next opportunity, and I don't want to feel that way about somebody  who I'm planning on going to the final six with. <br/>I guess what we're wondering is...  Will I sell you out sooner? Is that what you're asking me? <br/>Yeah, basically. <br/>No. Right now they have me in their alliance of six. They may think they have all the power, but I'm feeling like my goal is that  I have the power. [theme song playing] Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT CBS PARAMOUNT  NETWORK TELEVISION NETWORK TELEVISION NETWORK TELEVISION [man groans] [man  groans]  How gnarly was that, dude? <br/>How gnarly was that, dude? <br/>We can make a fire and...  We can make a fire and...  That was crazy. <br/>Sorry to surprise you like that. <br/>No worries. <br/>That was a textbook blindside to Ace. So I'm so glad that I stuck to my promise and didn't vote him out. But I'm not gonna corner myself with any pacts on my girlfriend again. Ace told me he had you in his back pocket, like you guys are friends, buddy  buddy. <br/>Yeah, that's exactly what he thought. <br/>As far as I know, Ace was totally like your...  He was playing you, Matty. <br/>Okay, well, he was playing you. <br/>I trust Kenny a lot more than I trust Ace. And Kenny's completely honest with me and told me that Ace has been trying to  throw me under the bus, so I figured I'd better take him out as soon as I can. <br/>You're gonna be gunning for me now, Crystal. <br/>No, she's not. <br/>Dude, that is... that's done. I mean, I'm looking at you in the whatever light we have, Matty. If you want to start from a clean slate, we can. <br/>Don't let anybody else...  Yeah, don't let anybody else get in your head. <br/>I'm a little concerned that Crystal's upset with me, because I voted for  Crystal. I had no options. I-I couldn't break that promise to Ace. I'm just praying for a merge and I'm praying for this game to change and if  it doesn't, to change and if it doesn't, I'm in deep trouble. I'm in deep trouble. <br/>Guys, I have a plan for the merge tomorrow. <br/>I hope there's a merge. <br/>We are going to be the final four, us four right here. Sugar does have the idol. <br/>You guys cannot tell them that I still have it. <br/>Yeah, okay. <br/>Nobody will know you have the idol. <br/>Cool. We're good. We're starting over. <br/>Hopes are high right now for the current Fang members, and if there's going  to be a merge, hopefully we can outwit, outlast and outplay the current  remaining Kota members so that we can go as far as possible. <br/>You guys are all survivors. <br/>Welcome to the game. <br/>Welcome to the game. [laughs] [laughs] [laughs] [growling] [growling]  Not only did I go above and beyond to be extra nice to Susie, I understood  that she thought I didn't do much around camp. Then we got to Tribal and she, like, whips out all this other stuff. I was, like, highly annoyed with it. <br/>Uh-oh. <br/>Oh... Ooh. Oh, it's a spoon. After what Susie said at last night's Tribal, I plan on burying her as soon  as possible, alive. I am an extremely vindictive person, and I will get my revenge. <br/>Here they come. <br/>Tree mail. "For a feast that will be catered and enjoyed under the sun, it's time  to party on the equator like a beach bash, so have some fun."  Wait, there's more. "Take only your personal possessions. All you need awaits your arrival, a brand-new tribe, a brand-new game, a new  way of survival."  Whoo! <br/>Is this my personal possession? <br/>This is mine. <br/>We got a beach, and there's food! <br/>Tree mail's got "merge" written all over it. It's talking about a feast. It's talking about fun, and most importantly it's talking about moving to the  beach. <br/>We're going to the equator. <br/>All I want to say is Kota six, and that's all that needs to be said on that. And don't be fooled. New tribe of the ten of us remaining, Kota Six to the end, remaining, Kota  Six to the end, Fang four, good-bye. Fang four, good-bye. <br/>Oh, wow! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>There's mixed nuts! <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Hi! <br/>Hi! <br/>My heart was pounding 'cause I couldn't tell you the feeling that seeing an  endless amount of food. It was, like, it was so nice. It was so nice. It was unforgettable. It says "Open only after you have finished enjoying your feast, as once  this box is opened, the feast is over."  We're not opening that until this is depleted. <br/>Guys, we're gonna be here all afternoon. The meatloaf? <br/>I gotta remember to swallow. <br/>Stay away from the box. <br/>There's a big box that says, "Do not open until everybody's done  eating." And I don't know what's in the box. I know whatever it is it ends the fun and it starts the game play again, and  I am going to prolong that as long as I can. <br/>This meatloaf tastes so good! <br/>Chow down! <br/>Kenny, no need to speak, just eat, dude. <br/>Oh, sweet. <br/>Does anyone want me to pour them a glass of white wine? <br/>Matty, could you hook me up? <br/>I would love red wine. <br/>There's, like, juice. <br/>There's two bottles of wine right there. right there. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I saw the hidden immunity idol note under the table. And the idol was more tempting than the food. <br/>What's that clue...? Is that something you guys brought? <br/>Yeah, let's see what it says. <br/>I was trying to read it to see what it was. And by then Charlie already looked over and started reading it, too. <br/>Read it out loud. <br/>And then, I read it and it said "You can either share it or keep it to  yourself." And I wanted to keep it to myself. <br/>Put it down until we eat. Just-just cover it and we'll read it...  I want to eat. <br/>Let's live in the moment right now. <br/>And then I was like, "Okay, I guess my cover is blown."  Guys, I feel bad not sharing this because I saw the whole thing. So I feel like you guys should take a look, too. <br/>What does it say? <br/>It's about the immunity idol. <br/>Damn it, damn it, there's my chance to find the hidden immunity idol for  myself, and Charlie blew it for me. <br/>"You have just discovered a clue to another hidden immunity idol. You can keep it a secret or share. Either way, you must find it before your day at the beach is over. On the sand lies a large dead log cradled in the crook of a tree. Beneath the end of the tree's lowest limb you can dig for immunity."  Who wants it? I see it. <br/>It's whoever decides to get up and finish eating. <br/>It's right over my right  It's right over my right shoulder. shoulder. <br/>I like that idea. I would...  That's a good idea. <br/>It occurred to me that if everyone's gonna act so casual about not really  wanting an immunity idol that's hidden just a few feet away from the table,  then fine, I'll call all of your bluffs... and I will force you to get rid of  it. What do you say we find it and, as a group, set it sail? <br/>Yeah, yeah, set it free. <br/>That's a great idea. <br/>We don't need no stinkin' idol. <br/>Randy caught my drift immediately and became the champion of this idea. <br/>Anybody opposed to finding the idol and setting it adrift? Sending it to the ocean gods? <br/>I think that'd be cool. <br/>Let's go. <br/>All right. <br/>I'm gonna start off shirtless-- if we get naked, then so be it. I didn't even need to see a note. I knew that the weird-shaped tree on the beach was significant. It was, like, pointing into the sand, and I'm, like, "How obvious."   What about over there? <br/>I told you I would in less than a minute, and it took two seconds. <br/>Yeah, Randy! <br/>I'm sorry if I'm sounding arrogant, but it was a joke. I gave myself 20 seconds. I think I took seven. I'm king of Gabon. <br/>That's your boasting rights, my friend. <br/>That's right. <br/>I'll say it loud and proud. Congratulations for your quick wit and mind. <br/>I found it, and, uh, I don't want it, and if anybody else wants it, by all  means, take it. <br/>You touch that, it's "good game" for you. Immunity-- the most important thing in this game. But if I were to take it, then I'd look like a snake. I can't take that chance. <br/>It's the apple in the Garden of Eden. <br/>Yeah, you want the apple, take it, but... no. <br/>You want the apple, Matty. <br/>Crystal? <br/>No, don't touch it, dawg. <br/>Don't touch it. <br/>I wanted that immunity idol. I'm not even gonna sit here and lie. I wanted that immunity idol, because that's pretty much your protection in  the game. <br/>It was the apple in Eden, and that idol represented the apple in Eden, and if  you grab that idol, you are biting into the apple and you'd be exiled from  Eden. <br/>Matty, you're thinking too long. <br/>I'm not gonna do it. And nobody wants to be thrown out of Eden. [several talking at once]  Just to tie it to the...  You sure? <br/>Yeah, 'cause of the sand. <br/>All right, guys, all of us to  All right, guys, all of us to the beach. the beach. <br/>With all due respect to President Bongo, I am the new king of Gabon. I'm sorry, but I rule. This ocean, it's mine. One last time-- anybody who wants immunity, it's theirs. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Who wants it? <br/>The ocean wants it. <br/>The ocean! All those Fang, Kota members, they work for me. they work for me. I'm king. Cheers. I'm king. Cheers. [whooping]  These people are so stupid. I got ten people to throw an immunity idol into the ocean. It's never been done. It was a perfect way to make the situation much easier for the Kota Six to  gain control of the game, because there's no extra idol floating around to  really screw up any votes. <br/>Throwing the immunity idol out to sea, yeah, it was a beautiful, lovely thought  and everything, but that is a very prized possession in this game, and  luckily, I have one. [laughter]  You guys want me to read it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, it's open. <br/>It says: "Note number one."  "Note number one."  Here we go. <br/>"In this bag, there are ten numbered stones. Without looking, each tribe member will grab a stone. When you are finished, read number two."  Okay. <br/>All right. <br/>"Note number two."  "Congratulations, you have just divided yourself into two new  tribes."  I thought there were gonna be ten new buffs in the box and that we were gonna  be a merged tribe. I just never in a million years... predicted. <br/>"The odd numbers are the new Fang Tribe. The even numbers are the new Kota Tribe."  Not again! [chuckles] Damn! [sighs]  "Open the bag, collect your new buffs, and immediately return to your  respective camps. The game has changed once again."  I knew that was gonna happen. <br/>"Enjoy the adventure." The new Kota Tribe is Bob and Marcus, Susie,  Crystal and Kenny. I missed you once, I'll miss you again. I'll see you in a day or two. The new Fang Tribe: myself, Charlie and Corinne, and then we've got Matty and  Sugar. Charlie and Corinne and myself have a deal, so... we're safe. Uh, I am worried about Marcus. I just don't trust Susie. Susie's crazy and Susie's stupid, and that's a horrible combination. <br/>Are you going? <br/>Yeah. See you in a day or two. <br/>We actually got lucky, and there is a majority of the Kota six in each of the  two tribes. I don't need the immunity idol. I have great relationships in this game. And that's honestly what I'm banking on. Because I know, at the end of the day, that no immunity idol gets me to the  finals. <br/>Are you here with us, or are you leaving? <br/>I feel like I have a lot more power right now, because I really can, if I  want to, swing... with Kenny and Crystal and take the power away from Marcus  and Bob. <br/>I'm still... the enemy. Even though I have on a yellow bandana, I don't feel very hopeful right now  as far as me lasting in this game if I'm gonna be on the shorter end of gonna  be on the shorter end of the stick. the stick. [indistinct chatter]  Welcome home. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Yes. This is it. <br/>Yes. This is it. <br/>You ready to do this? <br/>You ready to do this? <br/>Are youready to do this? <br/>I'm ready to do this. <br/>It's Kota. <br/>'Cause you know what this means, right? <br/>Yeah, this is... This is us, Bob. <br/>Yes. Yes. <br/>Everybody thought it was gonna be the merge, but now I'm Kota. Over here, all I have is Crystal. I feel like I don't have numbers, and I feel like, you know, I might be the  next to go, but hopefully, that's not the but hopefully, that's not the case. case. <br/>I know, that's so cool. <br/>Yes, he is. <br/>One of my best friends from Atlanta is her cousin. <br/>Yeah. 'Cause we were just talking, and he was just, like, "Yeah, you may not  know this guy named Kenny. Kenny Cox."  And she's, like, "Actually, yeah..."  "Yeah, that's my cousin." [laughs]  It's a small world. <br/>That's insane. <br/>I come to find out that Crystal is the cousin of one of my best friends. It's a really strange situation, because I feel... a little torn. I'm in a situation where I have completely calculated voting her out. But, you know, since we changed tribes, I don't know if that's still the case. If you're anything like your cousin, I mean, then I know... I know you're  good people, and-and I just... I just want to keep good people around, but...   That's, that's how I am. I think that was Kenny's concern, too. <br/>Crystal is actually a really cool girl. This is a person I can be straight-up with. This is a person I can talk to. This is me crumpling up my playbook, throwing it out the window. <br/>I'm telling you, this is my word. <br/>Yeah. <br/>In the unlikely event we have to go to Tribal, I'm not writing your name down. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm not writing Kenny's name down. I'm not writing Bob's name down. <br/>Yeah. I'm...  I'm telling you that right now. Marcus and I now have a link, and hopefully, I can use that link to my  advantage. But me telling Marcus that I won't write his name down, that's me playing the  game. Because I also told Ace I would not write his name down, and Ace not write  his name down, and Ace got blindsided. got blindsided. got blindsided. [trumpeting] [trumpeting]  Welcome to Fang, everybody. <br/>Thanks. <br/>That was a surprise, huh? <br/>Oh, my God. I knew that kind of crap was gonna happen. <br/>Yeah? <br/>I didn't want to believe it. <br/>The Kota Six, before the switch-up, decided that we were all gonna stick  together going into the hypothetical merge. But now we've been split up into But now we've been split up into two tribes...  two tribes... The Kota Six, luckily, were up three-two in both of the tribes. So we can still execute our plan and stay together, Kota Six. So I need to make sure that here at Fang, Corinne, Randy and I stick together  as the previous stick together as the previous members of the Kota Tribe. members of the Kota Tribe. members of the Kota Tribe. <br/>Oh. <br/>Oh. <br/>It's good to see you, man. <br/>It's good to see you, man. <br/>You, too. <br/>You, too. <br/>It's suicide. I mean, if she has the idol... The only thing we can say is we can tell Matty  we're voting for Sugar, Sugar we're voting for Matty, and then hope that if  she has the idol, Matty goes. <br/>If I were to vote tomorrow, I would vote for Matty. He doesn't have a hidden immunity idol and he's too much of a threat for me  in individual immunity, and he's threatening to Marcus and Marcus is my  alliance. So he will go home as soon as we vote. <br/>How do you get along with Corinne and Charlie? <br/>Awesome. My first gay friend. <br/>What about Corinne? <br/>She's-she's cool, too. <br/>Randy is a great dude, I love having him around, but I don't trust him. He went to Kota, he found a home at Kota, and that's his new family. I'm not too unpleased that Ace got voted out, because I didn't have to do it,  I didn't have to break my promise. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>But it upset me, because you just went along with Crystal like that. <br/>I thought I was going along with Kenny, 'cause Kenny was being honest with me. <br/>No, Kenny didn't trust Ace. <br/>Wow...! <br/>Y-Y-You...  I know. I know. <br/>Ace was covering you the whole time. He never was gunning for you. Ever. <br/>Now I believe that. <br/>And he might have gunned for you later, but he wasn't gunning for you now. <br/>I didn't know. I think Kenny and Crystal duped me. I feel awful that I got rid of Ace. I feel so bad. I wish I could apologize to Ace. I think I may have made a big mistake, and I feel really bad. I believe you. Thank you. We have to, I guess. <br/>There's nothing else to do. It's just you or I. <br/>You're right. <br/>We have to keep our eyes and ears open. So, if I hear that you're going to be voted out...  Yeah? <br/>You've got to use the idol. <br/>I know. <br/>If you're gonna hear that I'm going to get voted out, you gotta tell me so I  can try to maneuver something. Me and Sugar have each other's back and she has the idol. So, I think we can help each So, I think we can help each other. other. <br/>Were you trying to bring this back? <br/>Yeah, I have. I've brought some big logs back. I just... I might have to break this up. Hey, you know what? It might be easier to pull it up that way and then take it out. <br/>We have a powerful pact to get us to the final six without even batting an  eyelash. The way things divided up is perfect. <br/>And theoretically, like, nothing should change. Bob gives me a lot of confidence that he's not going to budge on the  situation. But Susie always made me a bit nervous. I think, given the opportunity, she would sell me down the she would sell me  down the river in a second. river in a second. <br/>We have numbers on both sides, kind of, right now. Let's say for some reason we lost. I can make a decision to go one way or the other. <br/>I am far more paranoid than I have been in this game. Kenny and Crystal are super tight and Bob and I are super tight here and  Susie's in the middle, spinning around in circles, playing dizzy bat. And where is she going to stop? I have no idea. <br/>We can make it to the top six. That's our goal, right? <br/>Yeah. But then, when we're there, where does that put me, then? 'Cause I am one of the weaker people. Is that gonna... Am I always going to be sixth? Because think about it. It's one thing to be in the top six, but I need to be in the top three. Marcus is basically the king, but I have the power right now to just cut his  head off. If I do switch, it's his own fault because he didn't give me fault because he  didn't give me a clear statement. a clear statement. a clear statement. [snorting] [snorting]  We got mail! <br/>I just think... Can you imagine a better... I mean, three and three? <br/>It's perfect. <br/>My only concern is that that crazy bitch Susie could flip to crazy bitch  Susie could flip to get rid of Bob and Marcus. get rid of Bob and Marcus. <br/>And that is a "save Marcus" move more than anything. And then, then it doesn't really matter what crazy Susie does. <br/>Right. I was very pleased with the conversation I had with Randy this morning just  regarding Matty, because we need to get rid of him first if we have to go to  Tribal, and, like, he totally is on board. 100%. <br/>If we have to go, as much as I'd hate to do it, we'd have to take out Matty. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Just because of the idol. There is a one in a billion chance that Sugar is, like, a rocket scientist  and she's hiding the idol. I'd like to see Matty stay around, but keeping Charlie and Corinne happy is  more important than keeping Matty happy. <br/>Hey, we got mail! "If you can't keep it up, there is reason to worry. You may be the first to join the jury."  If we can't keep it up? Up. Something in the air. <br/>You've seen the challenges where your wrist is like strapped to a huge bucket  of water? <br/>Oh! <br/>At this point in the game, I'm very concerned about my time here, and I don't  know how much I have left. Every moment seems to be pretty valuable. So today I'm going to give it So today I'm going to give it my all. my all. my all. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! How you guys doing? <br/>Great. <br/>Good. <br/>Probst: Marcus, are you starting to think maybe you don't have this game  completely figured out? <br/>Uh, yeah, I threw away my game plan the minute I saw that box open up and  reached in and pulled a number out. <br/>Probst: Corinne, happy with the new tribe division? <br/>You know, I've been Kota for a really long time. I still feel like Kota. In fact, we're not calling it "Fang." We're calling it  "Fayng," just 'cause "Fang" has such a bad connotation. <br/>Probst: Matty, as the only true remaining Fang member, is it hard to hear  Corinne say, "We don't even say 'Fang' 'cause that's tainted."  I'm trapped in the ghetto, man-- I can't get out of the ghetto, so whatever  you want to call it, I don't care. "Fang," "Fayng," I just want to get out of there one day. [Corinne laughing]  Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. Today's challenge, very simple in concept, much more difficult to execute. With your arms outstretched, you will use the tops of your hands to hold two polls  against an overhead board. If you lower your arms even slightly, you'll release the pressure on the  polls, the polls will drop. When a poll drops, you're out of the challenge. The last person left standing wins immunity for their entire tribe, keeps the  entire tribe safe from Tribal Council. To put it another way, the first tribe to lose all their members from this  challenge goes to Tribal Council. Somebody will be voted out. Make sense? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Each of you has an individual station that has been adjusted based on  your height, so everything is fair. Take a spot at your station. Take a spot at your station. We'll get started. We'll get started. Everybody feel good? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Okay. This challenge is officially underway. And after one second, Crystal is out. Last person left in this challenge wins immunity for their entire tribe. You will be a hero. Sugar is out after ten seconds. This is all about mind over matter. It is going to hurt and it's going to hurt quickly. 24 days you've been out here living on very little. Not much sleep. A lot of mental pressure. Susie's out of the challenge for Kota. Kota now down to three members Kota now down to three members left. left. left. Randy's starting to shake a bit. Randy's starting to shake a bit. Randy's out of the challenge, and Corinne is out of the challenge. Two more Fang members drop at the same time. Fang now down to two people Fang now down to two people left. left. Kenny drops the pole. Kenny is out of the challenge for Kota. Very quickly, this is coming down to a showdown. Bob and Marcus left for Kota. Bob and Marcus left for Kota. Charlie and Matty left for Fang. Charlie and Matty left for Fang. Marcus starting to shake a little bit, going to have to dig deep, find  somewhere else to go. to go. Change arm position. Change arm position. Marcus drops the pole. He's out of the challenge. Kota down to their last member. The oldest person in this game, Bob, fighting to hold on to Tribal immunity  for Kota, while Matty and Charlie fight for Fang. Bob drops his poles, Kota goes to Tribal Council, somebody going home. going home. Charlie struggling to hang on. Charlie struggling to hang on. Charlie is out. We have a showdown. Matty, the last Fang member remaining and Bob, the last Kota member remaining. <br/>Ain't no thing, Bobby Boy. <br/>Probst: Do not get foolish. Don't lose your concentration. Don't start listening to anybody, including me. All it takes is a moment's lapse in your concentration and you're out of this  challenge. That's it. [laughs]  Probst: Block it out. <br/>Matty's going to drop. He's going to drop. Matty's been shaking for a while, Bob, stick it up. [Matty laughs]  Probst: Matty's going to be laughing his way right to Tribal Council. That pole is right on the edge. Both poles on the edge of the board for Matty. You need to stop jabbering and start concentrating. <br/>You've got this, Bob. <br/>Probst: Matty has less than a quarter of an inch hanging on to the edge of  that board. If it slips off, it will fall. It's over for Fang. Bob hanging in there for Kota. Matty fighting. That pole is right on the edge. <br/>Hold on, Bob. Hold on, Bob. <br/>Probst: Trying to work it back now. Bob hanging in there for Kota. Bob hanging in there for Kota. Matty flirting with disaster. Matty flirting with disaster. Bob drops his pole! Matty wins immunity for the Matty wins immunity for the Fang tribe. Fang tribe. <br/>Way to go, man. I couldn't do it. <br/>Good job, Bob. <br/>Probst: Matty, congratulations. Not only do you keep yourself safe, you keep your entire tribe safe. Nice job. Matty single-handedly wins immunity for the Fang tribe. <br/>Probst: Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>It's "Fayng."  Probst: Don't forget your tribe flag, Fayng. <br/>It was good to win, but it really didn't matter. In fact, if we had lost, I'm absolutely sure that Matty would have been going  home. <br/>I'm pretty happy with myself right now that I, uh, I managed to pull that off. Now the curiosity is killing me. What's going to happen in Kota, 'cause it's totally up in the air. <br/>Probst: Kota, not such good news for you. Tribal Council tonight where one of the five of you will be voted out. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. <br/>I would like to see either Kenny or Crystal go home. The big question for me is can I get to the final three by trusting Marcus? We'll see where this is going to get me. I've got to get to that top I've got to get to that top three, I have to. three, I have to. <br/>We just got back from our first challenge as Kota Part Three, and it was a  less than ideal result. <br/>You did awesome. <br/>I really looked up to you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You did really great. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>I didn't even get one second out of it, 'cause it just wasn't... it didn't  fit right. <br/>Once they tilted it in I'm like, damn it. <br/>That was a tough one, for sure. Unfortunately, either Kenny or Crystal is going to have to go home tonight. I would prefer to have Ken go home tonight, just because Crystal and I have a  reasonably Crystal and I have a reasonably good relationship at this point. good relationship at this point. Let me tell you what I was thinking-- and I need you to be super honest if  you can do it or not-- would be, like, I hate to say it, but like, if Ken  goes home tonight then we're good. And then that gives us a shoe in for who goes next. Like, it's obviously going to be Susie. That's, that's a no-brainer for me. But the hope is that you're now part of the Kota Six, instead of Susie. It just...  Well, can you sell 'em on it? <br/>Yeah, because Corinne can't stand Susie. Randy, you know can't stand Susie and frankly, Crystal, the benefit of you  screwing up the benefit of you screwing up in challenges is that... in  challenges is that...  Right now, I am batting zero. <br/>Right now, I am batting zero. <br/>I hate to do this. <br/>I hate to do this. <br/>Marcus and I now have a solid relationship, but when you start talking about  knocking off my number-one ally just so you can get further in the game, I'm  not pleased. At all. <br/>I know you told me yesterday you weren't writing my name down. <br/>No. <br/>I'm telling you that I'm not writing your name down tonight. <br/>Marcus is playing the nice guy, but he's a schemer. I'm playing nice girl, liar and schemer. The game is outwit, outlast and you can't outwit Crystal Cox, you can't  outwit Crystal Cox, baby. baby. <br/>I'm thinking that the least threatening person is Crystal. She's not going to beat us. I mean, she has not run faster, she cannot swim, she can't balance. She can't even do the hand thing. <br/>Yeah, she had a hard time with that. <br/>So, let's minimize our risk of somebody getting immunity. <br/>I said we should take Crystal out first because she may do better now that  she's eating. <br/>Yeah, but you...  But then at the same time...  Bob beat her, I beat her... Like, she couldn't even hold-- You beat her. She's atrocious. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>My thought was tonight Ken and then hopefully we don't have to go for a while  but then Crystal would be next. <br/>Marcus has a lot of control of who should be voted off and Bob's just going  to follow whatever he says. I feel safer at this point to stay with Marcus in which way we're going to  vote. Right now I'm actually putting trust in you, and that's huge. <br/>I thought we've been doing that for a while at this point. <br/>Yeah, I know. And my guarantee is that you will help me get there. <br/>Once we get there, let's say that you got Matty and Randy there. <br/>Then it's just... But everybody knows Matty's a threat so, Matty's gonna go  first and then Randy and Bob and then Corinne...  I'm good with that. <br/>So, that makes the most sense. <br/>Okay. <br/>I feel like I can use Marcus to get me at least to the top three so I have a  chance at one. three so I have a chance at one. That's how I look at it. That's how I look at it. That's how I look at it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. Susie will either go with us or she gets voted off tonight. That's... that's... What do you mean no? What do you mean? <br/>Really? <br/>Yes. I can't let them do it. <br/>Marcus told you that he wanted to write my name down? <br/>Yes. And I'm not writing your name, And I'm not writing your name, Kenny. Kenny. <br/>Kenny being safe tonight is riding 100% on Sue. riding 100% on Sue. Or else Kenny goes home. Or else Kenny goes home. <br/>Did you clean the fish, Bob? <br/>What's that? <br/>You clean the fish? <br/>Yeah, I got it all right. <br/>Yeah, I got it all right. <br/>Almost ready to eat. <br/>Almost ready to eat. <br/>I don't feel super comfortable if I was to vote with Crystal and Kenny and  vote off Marcus. 'Cause I don't know if Crystal and Kenny could help me get to and Kenny could  help me get to the top three. the top three. the top three. <br/>Susie, Susie...  Susie, Susie... Okay? <br/>Okay. I have a huge decision to make tonight in which way to go. Either Marcus or Bob or I can vote with Kenny and Crystal. I don't know if it's good or bad. I'm confused and I just don't know. I don't know how to feel about it right now. it right now. It's scary and that's the truth. It's scary and that's the truth. <br/>Probst: So, Crystal, you and Kenny had not spent any time with Kota. What's it like? <br/>To me, the Kota camp is like corporate espionage. You wear the suit, but what's going on in your head? Whereas at Fang, this is the projects, I'm eating some rice, we're hungry,  let's go to war. And over there it's like "I wear my suit."  Probst: So, Bob, now that a merge maybe isn't around the corner, does it  change your strategy? <br/>Yes. Last time I was here one of the reasons I made the decision I made was I  thought a merge was imminent. I made a mistake. <br/>Probst: So, you're saying you regret your last vote? <br/>Had I known it was going to go this way, yes, I might have done something  differently. <br/>Probst: So, Marcus, is it important to keep this tribe physically strong to  win challenges or that I hang on to this alliance and hope that a merge is  coming? <br/>I think it's important to keep the tribe physically strong and ready for  challenges. My hope is to keep us as strong as we can. <br/>I think that's total bull, what he just said in his mouth. He's definitely looking for a merge around the corner and have numbers to  take out Fang. Is it not a strategy, Marcus, to vote out Fang? <br/>You know very well that we beat you guys seven times in a row and why would  we want to change any of the people in there? Frankly, I think you're really a nice guy and it sucks that your frustration  is being taken out in this direction, you know? <br/>But I feel that you are the leader of Kota and that you are the special Kota  guy that everybody's listening to to vote somebody off. <br/>I'm one of the five opinions here and we don't see who we vote for until the  final vote is called, so...  Probst: So, Bob, getting to the vote, is it clear-cut? <br/>Uh, yes. Yeah. <br/>Probst: Susie, is this an easy decision for you tonight? <br/>I've made my decision and I'm okay with it. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to get to the vote. to get to the vote. Marcus, you're up. Marcus, you're up. <br/>Ken, sorry, buddy, it's just  Ken, sorry, buddy, it's just that it's time. that it's time. <br/>You are not the Kota god. <br/>You are not the Kota god. Good-bye. Good-bye. <br/>Sorry, Ken. However, spilling your guts tonight makes it a little bit tonight makes it a  little bit easier. easier. <br/>You like comics when the little guy takes out the big guy or the bully? Well, hopefully that happens Well, hopefully that happens tonight. tonight. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final.
