<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously, on Survivor: The Heroes and Villains merged with  even numbers. <br/>Good to see you, brother. <br/>Probst: The Heroes thought they had the upper hand when Russell promised his  allegiance. <br/>This is where I stand. I swear on my kids that I am on board with y'all. <br/>Probst: But he was only reeling them in. <br/>Hook, line and sinker. <br/>Probst: Sandra warned the Heroes not to trust Russell... but only Rupert  believed her. <br/>If Russell is playing us...  He's not. Do not believe Sandra. <br/>He's on the Villain side for a reason. <br/>Probst: At the last challenge, Danielle got the immunity necklace around her  neck and the Heroes tried to put a noose around Parvati's. <br/>They're trying to vote me out. <br/>Yeah, they want you gone. <br/>Probst: Russell gave up his hidden immunity idol to save his queen, but  Parvati was only using him as a pawn. Unbeknownst to him, she had a second secret idol of her own. <br/>Two little green men protecting me. <br/>Probst: At a game-changing Tribal Council, the Heroes switched their vote to  Jerri. Parvati, sensing something was wrong, made a huge move. <br/>Sandra, that's for you. Jerri, that one's for you, too. <br/>Probst: She played both her idols to save the Villains and send home J.T...  leaving Russell wondering who's really in charge. Nine are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Well, it was a good one, you guys. (laughter) It really was, actually. <br/>Yeah, it was. It really was. I didn't see that coming at all. <br/>And now they got secrets going around? What the hell is up with that? So, Parv, where did you find the second idol? <br/>At the Outback Challenge. (Jerri gasps, Parvati laughs)  And you didn't tell me anything about it, when I saved your ass, and I've  been doing...  I wanted it to be a surprise. <br/>It's not a surprise. You lied to me. That's how I feel. <br/>How did I lie to you? <br/>'Cause you didn't tell me about it. Danielle knew about it. <br/>Your ass was never in danger. <br/>We found it together. We were gonna surprise you...  Yeah, well, you surely took the one I gave you, to save you again. <br/>I know. I was going to save Jerri. <br/>It pisses me off that y'all didn't tell me. <br/>Oh, chill out. <br/>Hell, no! <br/>I didn't tell anyone. <br/>Whatever, whatever. Keep on... y-you can talk all you want, but it is what it is for me. <br/>Okay, well, you can be mad if you want, but I don't see any harm done in  keeping it a secret. Russell likes to be in control, 'cause he thinks he's the godfather of this  game. And I think having me have an idol that he didn't know about made him feel like  he wasn't in control, and... scared a little bit. But that's kind of what I wanted, anyways. (laughs)  You were right-- he should've listened to...  I tried. <br/>Listen, um, the four of us are good, but we're going to see what's going on  there to break them up. <br/>All right. <br/>There's no way you're going to break up Danielle, Parvati and Russell. When they first came over, I had a chance with Sandra. I tried, I went to the Heroes and tri to tell them not to trust Russell. My Heroes did not want to believe me. With all that has happened, I don't know how easy it will be to pull Sandra  back in. She opened the door once. My only hope is to maybe get Sandra to open the door again. (whales singing)  Crazy night. You guys pulled a good one. <br/>Yup. It was just a regular vote, regular night. <br/>Wow. That was a good one. I'm impressed. <br/>But, uh, when it comes down to the top six, things have to happen. And right now the ship is sinking. You know that. <br/>Yeah, I know. <br/>And somebody, one person, has to jump, and that one person is going to be  very crucial to what happens later on in the game. We don't trust Sandra right now. That's why I need to pull somebody else in. And I think I can trust Candice, because Candice knows that her butt's in a  sling right now and she has no other way to go. If you're the last one standing, you won't be the last one, you won't go with  number six, I can guarantee that. <br/>Yup, yup. <br/>I don't want to sit here and say you're going to go to the top three, but  it's a strong possibility. <br/>Well, just let me know. <br/>Okay, I'll talk to you later. <br/>All right. <br/>I think that the right way to go is Candice. One hundred percent, she's ready to freaking burn her house down. It's huge in the game that we have numbers. Now it doesn't even matter what Sandra wants to do because Candice is going  to flip. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, you will compete in a Survivor version of  shuffleboard. You'll be randomly divided into teams of three-- black team, blue team and  red team. One at a time, you'll slide your puck across the board. The team whose puck ends up closest to the center of the "X" wins  reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>OTHERS: Yes. Yeah. Mm-hmm. <br/>Probst: Robert Louis Stevenson is most famous for writing the novel Treasure  Island. He spent his last years and is buried here in Samoa. The winning team will go to his home, which is now a museum, where you will  enjoy a screening of the movie Treasure Island. <br/>OTHERS: Aw... Nice! Cool! <br/>Probst: You'll spend the night, get a good night's sleep in a real bed,  return to camp in the morning. <br/>And there'll probably be a clue to the hidden immunity idol at today's  reward, so I'm hoping and praying that myself, Danielle, Russell or Jerri  goes on that reward and finds that clue-- just to keep the power in our hands. <br/>Probst: Worth playing for? <br/>OTHERS: Yes. Yes. <br/>Probst: We'll draw for teams, we'll get started. All right, we have our three teams. Candice, Parvati and Jerri-- the black team. Rupert, Russell, Sandra-- the red team. Colby, Amanda, Danielle-- the blue team. Black, you're up first. Candice. <br/>Get it, girl. <br/>Probst: Candice with the first shot. <br/>Eagle eyes. <br/>Probst: Everybody gets two shots. You'll go one at a time. Right down the middle. Good spot-- could get knocked around a little bit. Sandra with the first shot for the red team. <br/>Oh. <br/>Probst: Sandra off the board. Danielle first up for the blue team. Danielle comes up short. Parvati up for the black team. Red team, you're up. <br/>Ooh! <br/>Probst: Nice shot for the red team. That is the mark to beat. Amanda up for the blue team. Amanda comes up short. <br/>Come on, Jerri! <br/>Probst: Good toss by Jerri. Red still the mark to beat. Rupert gives a toss. And look at that! <br/>OTHERS: Oh! Whoa! <br/>Probst: The red team very close now. Colby up for the blue team. Not quite close enough. Everybody's had one toss. Round two. Candice. <br/>Oh! <br/>Candice was trying to knock those reds right off the board. Good idea. Didn't work. Sandra up for the red team. That was just a wasted shot there. Blue, you're up. And a nice toss! (shouts, clapping) Danielle knocks one red peg out of the way. The other red peg is still the closest by about a half an inch. Parvati, your last shot. Nothing changes after that shot. Russell up for the red team. Oh... Russell. <br/>Lame. <br/>Probst: On purpose? <br/>Right dead in the middle for the "X."  Probst: Blue, you're up. A lot of obstacles in the way of getting to that "X" now. Amanda comes up short. This is the last shot for the black team. Good toss but doesn't help. Black team is out of it now unless something happens. Rupert with the last toss for the red team. Comes up short. One shot left in this challenge. It belongs to Colby Donaldson. You know what you have to do. You either need to get rid of this red puck or get yours in tighter. <br/>Yeah! Yeah! <br/>Probst: Colby does it for the blue tribe! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Blue wins reward! (Colby whoops)  Probst: Candice, Parvati, Jerri, Rupert, Sandra, Russell, you guys head out,  head back to camp. <br/>Nice job, guys. <br/>Probst: Got nothing for you. <br/>We're eating all the rice, so don't come back looking for it. <br/>Probst: All right, Colby, Danielle, Amanda, big reward. Nice job. Grab your stuff, head out. Enjoy it. <br/>Thank you. Oh, my goodness. <br/>This is Robert Louis Stevenson's home. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote 13 books while he was here in Samoa. <br/>Oh! A bed! <br/>We have three books here, first addition... I will take you to the next room. <br/>At the reward, my main focus was finding the clue to the hidden immunity idol. Can I see this for a second? Oh, my God! Because Parvati played two last time, there has to be one in play this time. So the whole time, I was thinking, "Oh, my God, where could this clue  be?" Like, I am not leaving here without it. I have to get it. (dramatic music playing) Sitting on the bed, watching Treasure Island, I  didn't enjoy any of it. I was too busy thinking, "Where could this clue be? It's got to be in this room."  Popcorn's good, huh? <br/>Yeah, it's really good. Wow. I found the clue in the bowl of popcorn. I am freaking out. This is, like, so much power right now. This could be a million dollars. But Amanda was really suspicious. She literally gets up out of the bed, sits right next me. I'm, like, is she kidding me right now? <br/>Could you guys scoot over a little? <br/>Whatcha doing, Amanda? <br/>Nothing. Wow. Why am I getting, like... Amanda, I'll seriously grab it out of your hand. <br/>Will you just relax for a second? <br/>Hey, give it back to me! <br/>What are you doing? You're a psychopath! <br/>It's not yours. <br/>Yes, it is! Amanda...  I saw it there! <br/>Give it to me! You're kidding me-- I found it! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Give me back the clue. Can you give it back to me, please? <br/>No. <br/>Are you serious? <br/>It's not yours-- it was in the room. <br/>I found it. You're psychotic for, like, doing what you just did. You're really psychotic. Colby, are you serious, what she just did? <br/>I didn't even see what happened. I was watching Treasure Island. <br/>We... we have a problem, obviously. <br/>What's our... what's our resolution? <br/>Can you tell her to give it back to me so I can have it in my hand 'cause I  found it? And this is ridiculous. <br/>I mean, this is our life in the game; it's not ridiculous to me. <br/>It's ridiculous that you grabbed it the way you did. <br/>It was out of... (all talking) ...it was out of desperation. <br/>I'm, like, shaking right now. <br/>It's your clue, Danielle, it's your clue-- you found it. <br/>Yes, but I would like it back in my hand. <br/>Give it... It's okay. <br/>I need a glass of wine. <br/>Yeah, so in the end, I ended up giving the clue back and gave it to Danielle,  like an idiot. And then Colby wasn't backing me up, and I was just, like, "Oh, my  God." I was just, like, "Are you kidding me?" Oh! (squawking) (indistinct talking)  SEVERAL: Hey! <br/>Look at you guys! <br/>Welcome back! <br/>Hey, guys. <br/>And if me and Russell and Rupert had won that...  It would've been really funny. <br/>Like, the three of us barely fit in. <br/>That's awesome. (Russell speaks indistinctly)  (whispers): Amanda grabs it from underneath me and runs over to the other  side of the room, so I jump up, I grab her and I hold her arm, and I was,  like, "Give me that ... thing back!" And I wrestled her to the  ground and ripped it out of her hand. <br/>(laughs): Oh, my God! <br/>"Follow the path to where you get water for drinking."  It says on the clue something about a stream where they drink water. It's by the stream over here under a rock, by a bendy tree. Danielle's looking at one side, I'm looking at the other side. I pick up a rock after being there five seconds-- there it is. She turns her back to me. I take it out, throw it to the side. I sit on it. I-I hid it in my pocket. I wanted to break away from her immediately. Because they hid... they hid an immunity idol from me. They didn't let me know about it. You know what? I'm not letting them know about it. I am the king of hidden immunity idols. (thunder rumbling)  It's still raining. <br/>Barely. (thunder crashing) This is my guarantee to you that I'm serious and this  isn't... I have the idol. <br/>How'd you get it? <br/>Because she gave me the clue, and I found it before she even got there. <br/>Nice! <br/>With me showing you the idol, it should show you that I trust you 100%. <br/>Will you show it to me now? <br/>You want to see it now? <br/>I'd rather see it now. <br/>Okay, let's go see it, then. <br/>All right. <br/>Stick with me. I could take you places. <br/>Knowing that Russell has the idol could be a little bit of ammunition for me,  but right now I can't tell anybody, because I can't trust anybody to not take  a little bit of information that they get and use it against me. <br/>But now you trust me. <br/>I trust you. <br/>We are going to the final three. This is what's gonna get us there. <br/>I'm not sure that I trust Russell a hundred percent, but it's a big thing  that he showed me the hidden immunity idol. So it's just, it's really tough. It was a tough decision to make. <br/>This is real. <br/>All right. <br/>Tyson was first-- he was in my alliance. Then they took out Boston Rob-- he was in my alliance. They took out Courtney before we came here because they knew that if me and  Courtney came over here, they were done. <br/>Okay. <br/>So if I flip with you guys and make it five against four, it's either got to  be Danielle, Parvati or Russell. When Tyson went and then Boston Rob went and then Courtney left me, I was,  like, I'm done. But now that they took out J.T. and now I can jump to them and be five against four, now is the perfect time  for me to make my move. <br/>In terms of the idol, I agree with you-- Danielle has it. <br/>And she's greedy. <br/>I also agree she's not gonna give it away. I know Danielle has the hidden immunity idol, or will, because she has the  clue. So we have to assume she's gonna find it and she'll have it in her possession. But if Danielle doesn't win immunity today-- which I'm gonna try my damndest  to keep her from it-- don't you think she'll play the idol tonight? <br/>She don't think she's in bad shape. They won't tell me till, like, an hour before who it is, because they don't  tell me nothing. <br/>So we need to make sure they don't think you're flipping. So the thing is, we need you. We need you, and if you want to do this, do we first take out Russell or  Parvati? Tonight. <br/>What, did Colby try to talk to you any? <br/>No. He-he's kind of, like, uptight. Like Jerri said, he, like, doesn't have no personality. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I know I told you I haven't talked to him since the day we got here-- that's  why he's dying to talk to me. <br/>We have five votes right now. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>We have six votes. <br/>Oh. <br/>Like, if you would flip, and all of a sudden we get five votes and you vote  another way... that would be...  It wouldn't matter. <br/>...bad for the game. <br/>No. No. Hold up. You're doing math wrong. <br/>No... no, I'm saying we have six people. We have one person from their tribe voting with us today. <br/>Oh, okay. <br/>But anyway, I trust you. (Sandra laughs)  If I stay with the Villains, I'm top five, I'm not moving up from there--  because they're not willing to get rid of Russell. That's why I have to flip to the Heroes-- because I need to get Russell out. Russell? You want Russell gone? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Russell's gone. He's gone. <br/>All four of us are going, all four of us will vote for...  Yeah, but Russell just told me now, somebody from them already came to us  again. I'm hoping that one of those girls is lying, and that they're gonna stick  with you. They need to stick with you or this won't work. If they don't stick with you, they're going home one after the other. So it's up to you. <br/>I'd rather... Which do you want? I'd rather put Russell's ass out there. My gosh, alls it will take is Sandra to switch over to our side, there's five  votes for Russell, we could get Russell out of this game! The guy is a piece of garbage. <br/>Sandra's the one that came to me. And then this morning, she just spilled the beans of why she's so sick of all  of them, including Russell. Really wants to get rid of Russell. Um...  So we vote tonight for whoever she wants? <br/>Yeah. I mean, this is it. So... I don't see any reason why Sandra would bluff me at this point. If Sandra's telling me the truth. Who knows, she could be playing me for the Villains. But if she's telling me the truth, you know, she's ready to come on board and  play ball with us. So this changes everything, in a hurry. So what we've got to do is go into immunity, try to win to prevent the  Villain from getting it. But if we don't, we hope that Sandra's telling us the truth, we hope she's  gonna vote with us, and in that case, we will either vote out Russell or  Parvati tonight. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: First things first. Danielle. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will each have a 150 wooden tiles. On my go, you will use those tiles to build a house of cards ten feet tall. First person to finish wins immunity, is guaranteed a one-in-eight shot at  winning this game. Losers go to Tribal Council, where somebody will be voted out. We'll draw for spots, we'll get started. All right, here we go. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go. First person to get to ten feet wins immunity. Very quickly, there are lots of different strategies about how to build this. It's going to take some experimenting. You may crash and burn a few times. Don't panic if yours crumbles. Don't panic if you see the person next to you doing better. Jerri doing a very nice job. Russell's doing a nice job. Building a nice base. Danielle staying in it. Colby's building a nice house of cards. And it all comes tumbling down. Jerri just at about six feet. Russell at five feet. Danielle at four feet. Amanda still on her first level. Sandra's collapses. Sandra now starting over. Jerri now getting close to the eight-foot mark. <br/>Oh. <br/>Probst: It's Russell and Jerri both just under eight feet. This is when you have to be very careful. Jerri with a few seconds' lead right now. Russell's going to have to pick it up. Jerri at the nine-foot mark. This will put her at nine and a half feet. Russell at the nine-foot mark. This will put him at nine and a half feet. Nobody else is even close at this point. This is neck and neck. Russell is out of cards. Trying to make a little pyramid to get him at ten feet. Russell's not there. Russell's going to have to hustle. Jerri on her last stack. Jerri wins immunity! (Jerri whoops) By seconds over Russell. <br/>Yay! (Jerri whoops) Okay. (Jerri laughs)  Probst: Come on over, Jerri. <br/>Yay! (laughter) My very first immunity. <br/>Probst: Ever? <br/>Ever! <br/>Probst: Congratulations. <br/>Yay! <br/>Probst: Came at a good time, right? <br/>It did. <br/>Probst: With this, Jerri is safe at tonight's Tribal Council, guaranteed a  one-in-eight shot at winning this game. For the rest of you, after 30 days in this game, one of you going home  tonight. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. Congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I'm voting for Russell because I've been waiting to take him down for 30 days. 30 days too long. It's time for revenge, and this is for Courtney, Boston Rob, Tyson, and even  Coach, who I don't care about, but I'll stick him in there, too. (bird squawking)  I'm having an amazing day. This is the first time I've ever had immunity, so I'm just trying to  appreciate and really live in the extreme high I'm experiencing right now,  'cause it feels good. (Jerri laughs) I'm swimming in yay. (laughs)  That's good. You go, girl! <br/>My very first immunity! <br/>I'm fine with Jerri winning. Any one of my teammates could have won it, and I'm fine with that. I mean, look at the other side. Rupert and Colby? They're done. They look done. And Candice thinks I'm going to take her to the top three. I haven't really made the decision yet. So Amanda is really an aggressive, strategic player. She's kind of like Boston Rob in a girl's body, so she has to go. Let's put her name down tonight. We really ain't got to discuss much. <br/>Yeah, I know. I know she's working it, you know? <br/>Put her name down tonight. I guarantee you, she'll have six votes anyway, but I just want to make sure  that everything's cool with me and you, with you putting her name down. I trust you. I just, you know, I'm playing the game like you. &gt; Listen, I'm-I'm ready to put her name down. She has crossed me too many times... Going into Tribal, I knew that either  way that I chose could be really the beginning of the end for me, because I  was going to make people really mad on either side, and, uh, you know, just  the fact that Russell had the immunity idol and could pass it to anyone made  me nervous about not voting with the Villains. And, uh, so, I felt like I had to go with the plan that was the most solid. <br/>I know I got to pack. I never went to Tribal Council and not taken...  Yeah. Me, neither. Me, neither. <br/>Since Pearl Islands when I walked in there thinking I was safe and went home  with nothing. <br/>Oh! <br/>Nothing. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>The one time I thought I was safe-- that's the day I went home. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We got lucky because Russell's going home tonight. Done. <br/>Take my turn? <br/>Yup. <br/>Hmm? <br/>Um...  Acting like she's crying...  Sandra. (Sandra mumbles) No. I want to talk to you. Sit down. Before Candice gets up there. I don't know why she's running up here, but, uh, she said that you said...  you know, putting my name right now. You're saying you're going to vote for me. <br/>No, nobody's going to vote for you. <br/>That's what she said was said. <br/>Amanda's going home. <br/>An idol's getting played tonight. <br/>I'm not scared, Russell. <br/>Nah...  Why are you trying to threaten me? <br/>I ain't threatening you. I'm just saying... I just... I-I... I believe that Candice believes that this  is her only option, and, uh, Sandra, the same thing, and because of that,  they have to make the decision to get Amanda out of here. <br/>Right. Then it does...  If you put Amanda's name tonight, she goes home, period. <br/>Yeah, I am. <br/>If you put Amanda's name down. Either one of you all switch, then it don't matter. If you put it, she goes home. If you put it, she goes home. She goes home. <br/>But she is going home. <br/>Right. <br/>If Candice and Sandra flips on me today, then I go home. They both would have to have some kind of genius plan to flip on me tonight  to go to the Heroes? The beat-up Heroes? If they do that, then more power to 'em. <br/>Uh-uh. <br/>Candice went and told Russell every single thing that was said, including  that I was on board with Rupert, Amanda and the rest of them, and now we're screwed,  and now they won't trust us anymore after this. <br/>Why are you switching now? <br/>She's not. <br/>I'm not switching. <br/>Listen...  You're-You're with us? <br/>Yes, she's totally with us. <br/>Oh, my God. We are trying like heck to keep everybody calm. <br/>So we just have to figure out...  I'm not hanging you out to dry. <br/>Listen, we're okay. Sandra, you're good. Candice is on our side. We're voting for Parvati. <br/>We're not going to let you hang out to dry. None of us will. <br/>We're not going to let you hang out to dry. We're voting Parvati. Now, who's going to tell Amanda? <br/>I'll tell Amanda. (Sandra mumbles)  We think Russell got wind of our plan and has convinced Danielle to give the  idol to him, but the greed inside of her is going to make her not want to  give it away. If we vote all for Danielle, they've still won. If we vote for Russell, and Danielle goes to give it away, they've still won. So maybe we throw Parvati in and just vote for her, 'cause nobody's gotten  her on the radar. <br/>So if this thing doesn't work out...  What do you mean, am I gonna help you? What do you want me to go to do? <br/>Are we going to do this? <br/>Yes. <br/>Okay, so...  Yeah, if this thing doesn't work, it's Candice's fault. True or no? <br/>No. <br/>No, really. I mean, really. If this doesn't work, then Candice is the one who spilled the beans. <br/>You got five... It's insanely crazy right now. There's three days of scrambling going on in three minutes. <br/>We need to do this. We need to vote out Parvati, and we'll be right on track. If you're scared of Russell, we'll write his name down. I promise you. I bet you 100%, Danielle will not give him the idol. The fact that me and you are now talking like this, we're done already. We're freaking done. Russell, can we just have a minute, please? It's like every time I try to do something, somebody is in my face. I can't even do nothing. It's crazy. <br/>The only way we can fix this is to do what they said, because they think  you're just jumping ship. <br/>You're scared. And I am jumping ship, and I'm doing it for you. I did this for you. I jumped ship for you. Why do you tell Russell everything we talked about? Why did you run to him? <br/>I didn't run to him. <br/>Oh, my God. We're done. Know what, they're going to bury us. We can get rid of Amanda later. If we don't take care of one of them now...  But they have the idol, and we don't know who it's... who is gonna...  You're going to do this for real, after I put my neck on the line for you  guys all day today? <br/>Sandra. Sandra. <br/>And now everything that we worked for is about to go down the tubes? <br/>Well, then, I mean...  Tell me who you want out, please. *  Probst: Now bring in the members of our jury. Coach... Courtney... and J.T., voted out at the last Tribal Council. So, Rupert, after the last Tribal Council, the Villains had the number  advantage. So, when you're looking at the Villains, how do you figure out who might be  vulnerable? Who might be the one that would want to flip to improve their lot? <br/>We've been talking about that for a while. But for one of the Villains to jump ship right now, they're still going to  feel like they're fifth. So there is no real need for any of the Villains to do anything but stay with  their five. <br/>Probst: Sandra, even Rupert, a Hero, says it's a crazy idea. <br/>It's true. The best bet is just to stay with those who you're with, you know? But some of the Heroes have talked to me, and I know that they sense that I'm  on the outside, because even I know that I'm on the outside within my own  group. <br/>Probst: So, Amanda, how do you make it appealing to somebody like Sandra, who  would say, "I'm already fifth with the group I got here with from the  beginning"? <br/>Well, you offer them a better deal. <br/>How do you know the deal that she's got going on now isn't the best deal? <br/>She might have the best deal. She's weak in challenges. She's easy to beat for the vote. Sounds like somebody I want to take with me to the jury. <br/>But there are so many times when I feel like I'm not wanted. You know what I'm saying? So I have, like, a sense of frustration within my own alliance. <br/>Probst: So, Russell, clearly, it ain't paradise in the Villain tribe. <br/>First of all, the whole team, we play completely different. Danielle plays her way. She's real aggressive. You know, that's how she plays. I'm aggressive, too. And Jerri, she plays a different way. She's the calm one of the whole bunch. Parvati, she's, you know, the charming one of the whole bunch. She plays a different way. <br/>What about me? You didn't include me. <br/>Sandra, she's just there with us. <br/>Probst: That's a big statement. <br/>See? I'm just there. <br/>Probst: So, Rupert, there are cracks in that fivesome. <br/>I wish I would have known there was distrust before right now sitting here at  Tribal Council. <br/>Probst: Russell, is one of the reasons you like how Danielle plays is that  the more she plays, the less chance she has of winning? <br/>Yeah, I'll tell you what, she's fighting to get further in the game. If she gets further in the game, I get further in the game. That's why I was glad she did go to the reward, because there's going to be  another clue for the hidden immunity idol, and she got it. And she had to be very aggressive to get it. <br/>Probst: Colby, so what's the sense about the hidden immunity idol? <br/>Danielle has it. Yeah, definitely. That's the consensus on the Hero tribe. <br/>Oh, yes, Danielle's found it. <br/>Probst: Parvati, everybody thinking Danielle has the idol might take the heat  off of Danielle. Now maybe you're vulnerable. <br/>Um, yeah, I definitely feel vulnerable. I'm just trusting my alliance to stay with me. But if somebody flips and they try to make it interesting, then I have no  protection. Because I've given my protection away. <br/>Probst: Russell, if somebody from the Villains were to flip to the Heroes,  you've got to be a huge target. <br/>You know, unless I find an idol, I'm gone. But I take risk in the game. And if you get caught with your hand in the cookie jar, you go home. But I'm well aware of that, and I'll take the risk all day long to get  further in the game. <br/>Probst: All right, Jerri, you have the immunity necklace-- I assume you're  keeping that? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Probst: You cannot vote for Jerri. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Russell, you're up. <br/>You're a very strategic player, but I believe I know what's going on tonight,  so I'll be using the idol to get rid of you. And I found it, not Danielle. <br/>I have to play my game, you have to play yours. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. <br/>You know what, Jeff? For some reason, I think somebody has flipped. And to keep them all honest... hope I'm doing the right thing and playing it  for myself this time. <br/>Probst: The rules of Survivor state that if anybody plays a hidden immunity  idol, then any votes cast against that person will not count and the person  with the next highest number of votes will be sent home. I'll read the votes. First vote... Amanda. Amanda. Two votes Amanda. Parvati. Two votes Amanda, one vote Parvati. Parvati. We're tied-- two votes Amanda, two votes Parvati. Amanda. That's three votes Amanda, two votes Parvati. Amanda. That's four votes Amanda, two votes Parvati. Parvati. That's four votes Amanda, three votes Parvati. 12th person voted out and the fourth member of our jury... Amanda. That's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Okay, Jeff, I know you've been waiting forever to do this... so just do it. (laughs)  Probst: Amanda, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Probst: Well, in spite of the fact that another Hero was voted out tonight,  one thing is very clear from tonight's Tribal Council-- the Villains are not  one, big happy family. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor...  We're set up pretty good. Five Villains. But we need to be strong. <br/>Probst: The powerful Villains alliance... comes apart at the seams. <br/>Don't yell me, Russell. <br/>I can't believe you. <br/>If she tries to get rid of either of us, we can easily blindside her. <br/>Do not change your vote tonight no matter what he says to you. <br/>Bad move, you're going to be next. <br/>I made too many mistakes, and when you make too many mistakes in Survivor,  you get booted. I kind of messed myself up in the reward when I gave the clue to Danielle. I should have kept it. It would have been kept me in the game. I think that was my biggest mistake. I think the rest of the game is going to be absolutely crazy, and I'm kind of  glad I'm not a part of it, to be honest.
