<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor: After helping to vote  out Andrew, Lill was feeling good about turning on her former Morgan Tribe. <br/>Usually I have regrets stabbing someone in the back. This time, I feel like I stood up for myself. <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge... Fire. ...Rupert had the sharpest aim. There it is! <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Rupert wins reward! But decided to give the reward away. <br/>Burton gave me the immunity last night. I'll give him the breakfast. <br/>Probst: Burton, you're going to breakfast and you're  taking somebody with you. Burton chose Lill to join him for a breakfast feast. <br/>Oh, my Lord. <br/>Probst: They indulged. <br/>To the outcasts. <br/>To the outcasts. <br/>Probst: And Burton hatched a plan to get rid of Rupert. <br/>We've got to get Rupert off right now. Okay, so you need to make friends with Christa and say,  "Listen, I'm going along with whatever you guys want."  Well, see, now, it's starting to lie and I'm going to have  a problem with that. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, Rupert guaranteed  himself three more days by defeating all the others. And with that, Rupert has immunity. [ laughing ] Back at camp, Ryno was feeling vulnerable and tried  some last minute strategizing. I could get the two girls, and if you could get Lill, you know,  we kind of control our own destiny. <br/>Probst: But at Tribal Council... Ryan. Ryno was voted out. <br/>I'll be back, guys. <br/>Probst: He became the first member of the jury. Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION [  thunder rumbling ] NETWORK TELEVISION [ thunder rumbling ] [ thunder crashing  ] [ snake hissing ]  Nighttime is my one bad time. If I could go just 39 days and never have to sleep, I would make  this beautifully. But nighttime is killing me. [ quietly ]: Just got to make it through another day. And another and another and another and another... At night out  here, I start thinking about family. That's when I miss my family. [ thunder crashing ] I tell Laura, my wife, all my woes and  sorrows, all my triumphs. I tell Laura everything. And I want for everyone to see I am the best damn survivor that  has ever been. I am it. I know they will. Shouldn't think that way, I know. I know. I know. I know. I hear you. I hear you. Take it down to the one or two people that I truly, really care  about. I care about Sandra and Christa. They care about me. It's very hard keeping mentally aware of everything that's going  on around here. I try to guide everything that goes on on my island. I try to direct everyone's actions while keeping myself grounded  and aware of what is going on and what I am doing, not settling ever for  anything but first. And letting everybody here realize that they are finishing in  places of honor. To build them up to be a winner and still lose... that's a hard  mental battle. <br/>Beebee. that's a hard mental battle. <br/>Beebee. <br/>Thank you, baby. [ chuckling ]  I know. [ kisses ] Blah, blah. <br/>Honestly, Rupert and Christa are making me sick with  their, "Baby, baby, beebee, beebee," blah, blah, blah. [ Rupert laughing ]  I know. <br/>I've been saying this in my head and I... I've never... I  haven't vocally expressed this thought, but I feel, uh, Rupert, Christa and  Sandra have gotten to the point of... of the old saying, "Absolute power  corrupts absolutely." They are so power-ridden, they know it, that they  feel that they're above the law. <br/>Jon and I will be back in about 15, 20 minutes. <br/>That's very good. <br/>Burton and I decided to go on a... well, we decided to  talk a little strategy, knowing that the bond between Christa, Rupert and  Sandra pretty much puts us at fourth and fifth. Like, to hand-feed me number four and say, "Jon, be happy. It's number four." No. That's not going to make me happy. <br/>We need to be starting to chat up with D and T. Just be like, "Hey, listen. You guys know you're going. "If we can knock Rupert off, we can break this triad  deal." If we can take him out now, we need to. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>But, we need to... We just need to start getting a  foundation with D and T. <br/>Once again, Jonny Fairplay finds himself in a great  position. He can either go with Plan A: Christa, Rupert, Sandra, and  Burton, or Plan B: Burton, D, T, and Lill. And, uh, I'm throwing all my eggs in choice "B." You  know, if the bases are loaded and, you know, you got three people saying,  "Hey, bunt"... Screw you, man. This is my chance to knock a grand slam. <br/>Rupert would be scrambling. The thing is he will be livid, like, beyond belief. <br/>I know. <br/>The problem is it's more risky to flip the alliance now  and to go against Rupert, Chris and Sandra. If I go this other way, I have a much better chance, but if I  get caught and the cover is blown, it's not going to be a good thing. That's why we've got to start talking to those girls, 'cause  right now, we're about to get screwed, too. I talked to Lill about this and I've talked to Jon about it. So, we didn't know when to tell Tijuana and Darrah what the plan  is to flip on our original alliance. <br/>It's empty. on our original alliance. <br/>It's empty. <br/>Good boy. <br/>I think I need to go fishing. <br/>Good luck, Rupe. <br/>All right, let's get that big-ass shark today. Big-ass shark steaks. I have to go out and get fish. I would love it if I was a mean-ass son of a bitch and just went  out and got fish for myself. But, so, what do you do? You go out and get fish. <br/>Days can't pass by fast enough, you know? <br/>They're gone. <br/>Burton and I found ourselves with an opportunity--  everyone else there with Rupert fishing and Sandra and Christa going to get  lemons. I looked at Burton, Burton looked at me. He was like, "You think now's the time?" I was like,  "Absolutely."  A shark appears, and I'm like, "Ah, I want him. I want him, bad." But, the only way I'm taking that shot is  if I can get directly over him, hit him straight down in the head and hold  that spear into him. Because, if not, he's going to be gone with my spear. <br/>The alliance between Rupert, Sandra and Christa... the two  of us...  It's unbreakable. <br/>The two of us are on the outside. <br/>Right. <br/>Because, Rupert's threatened threatened by me, they all--  every single one has told me they want him out the second there's a chance. Bottom line is, if those three are in at the end, no one else  will be. Because, Rupert will win every immunity. <br/>And, you know what, I'd rather have one, two... well,  four, five, four, three, whatever. <br/>Me, too. <br/>I would love to have this... versus that. <br/>Here's the key. Here's the key. Number one, Rupert goes first. If he doesn't win immunity, we go after Christa. No one can breathe a word, if we're all... Oh... Here it is. Here it is. <br/>I have an important... I have one important... When they  come to us and say, "Okay, Darrah's next."  If they think that I'm going to be the next one to go,  I'll just play it off like, "Yeah, I know I am."  "There's nothing I can do about it."  Yeah. Okay. <br/>Okay, just remember, we have-- the five of us-- have to  stick together until all three of those are gone. <br/>Look, we know it, that's it. There's no more talking about it, 'cause someone could overhear. [ Jon speaks indistinctly ]  Yeah, you're going to be here...  You're going to be here for... Gimme, gimme, gimmegimme. <br/>We tell them, Rupert's going home. Their eyes are about as big as the sun. They can't believe it. They're like, "Oh, my God! Thank you guys so much! Thank you so much!" So, the game's about to take a serious,  serious change. <br/>All right, let's get some... do some work. <br/>I was down in the dumps, thinking that I was going to go  home, but all of a sudden, that changed. And now, I'm just... I'm ready to stay. <br/>I almost had a four-foot gray reef shark. My God, I sure did want that shark. I love being the baddest hunter out there. I never give up, I never surrender, I never admit defeat. <br/>We got sea mail. <br/>We got sea mail? <br/>Yup. <br/>Read that puppy. Let me see that boat. "Morgan, Drake and Balboa, "in their shadows you'll  compete, "not for gold or silver, but a reward just as sweet. "From poop deck to crow's nest, just as fast as you please,  "be the best swabbie you can be for the adventures on the  sea."  So, we're going to probably be climbing something from  bottom to top. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We got tree mail, and the clue says, you're going to be  following in the shadows of ancient pirates. I think I've got a pretty good shot at it if it's something that  has to do with speed. If I do win, just to keep the impression that our alliance was going  strong, I'll be giving my reward to Rupert, because he gave me his last time. Well, you got one coming back your direction. [ laughing ] Soon as I can beat you. [ Rupert laughing ]  The deal between Burton and I, after I had given him my  bacon, my breakfast, my wonderful breakfast... he said he owed me, and he  would pay me back with the next challenge he wins. Burton promised me. It's fine. It keeps unity between he and I. It's a deal. It keeps unity in our group. <br/>Probst: Come on, guys. Let's get to it. For today's reward challenge, you'll take part in an obstacle  course that will move you along an old pirate shipwreck. You'll be running in teams of two. On my go, both members of a team will scurry up the fishnet to  the first platform. When both tribe members are on the platform, you'll race up the  cargo net, retrieve a bell, and ring it. You come down, your partner goes up, and also rings the bell. Using a grappling hook, you'll then grab a rope and swing across  to the second platform. Make your way up to the crow's nest where you'll untie a series  of knots and release a second bell. Both members must ring the bell. You then slide down the sail to the last platform. At the last platform, you'll release a sandbag with a bell  striker on it. Only one person needs to ring the last bell. Winning pair moves into the finals. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Today's reward is an adventure day. You'll go deep-sea fishing. Anything that you catch, you keep. And you'll do it all aboard this ship. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Catamaran. It'll be yours for the afternoon. Any afternoon on a catamaran needs one thing-- pizza and beer. <br/>Oh! That's what it's all about. <br/>See, now, that's worth it. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Probst: We're gonna draw for teams. <br/>Oh. <br/>Probst: Burton and Lill once again paired up together. Christa and Darrah working together. Winner of this heat goes on to the final. Survivors ready? Go! Christa and Burton both neck and neck. Burton starting to pull his bell. Christa getting hers. Christa and Burton both have rang the bell. Burton's down. Lill and Darrah both going up. Ring it, Darrah. There it is. Get down and move on. Darrah's down. Christa and Darrah moving on. Lill takes a hard fall. Christa, using the grappling hook, gets the rope, and she's off  and soaring. Send the rope back. Darrah missed it. She's gonna need to use the hook. Darrah right behind Lill. It's a close race. You have to untie these knots. You will release another bell. Ring it, slide down the sail. Burton has it almost undone. Christa right behind him. It's gonna be a race to the finish, to the final platform. Burton rings it. Lill rings it. [ bell rings ] Burton has a sandbag, getting the bell. Burton and Lill move on to the final! Here we go. The second heat-- T and Sandra, Rupert and Jon. Survivors ready? Go! The girls up the net first. T up first. Rupert right behind her. T grabbing that bell. Ring it. Get down. When she's down, you go up, Sandra. Rupert has it. He rings it. Got to get down. Go, Sandra. Ooh, Rupert takes a hard fall. That a way. Down. You guys are dead even. Let's go, get that rope. Go T, go. Rupert has the rope, flies across, lets it go. Jon grabs it. Use that hook, Sandra, to grab the rope. Rupert up first to the crow's nest. Rupert working on the ropes. T working on her ropes. Rupert has it. He rings it. Slides down the sail. Wow. Jon, did you ring the bell? You didn't ring that bell. Jon's got to go back. Now, Jon rings it. [ yelling ] [ indistinct chatter ] [ bell rings ] You're right  back in it. Somebody grab the slack. Rupert and Jon almost there. Rupert and Jon moving on! For the final round, it's Burton and Lill versus Rupert and Jon. This time, you will be retrieving puzzle pieces. At the first station, you'll untie a bag of puzzle pieces. The second person will ring the bell. At the second station, puzzle pieces. Second person rings the bell. At the final station, use the cutlass, chop the sandbag. Attached is a key. That'll open your treasure chest. First team to complete the puzzle wins. For reward. Survivors ready? Go! Burton up first and up and over. Burton and Rupert both working on their first bag of puzzle  pieces. Rupert has his. Has to head down before Jon can head up. Saw way too much of Rupert on that. It's up to Jon and Lill to ring the bells. Jon rings the bell. Lill rings her bell. Both teams moving on. Rupert across. Jon across. Rupert already starting on the second bag of puzzle pieces. Burton throws the rope back. Lill takes a face plant. Rupert has his second bag of puzzle pieces. Burton, working fast on his knot, right behind. Burton and Lill right behind them. Rupert and Jon have their keys. Let's go. Go, go, guys. Wait for Lill. Chop. We're dead even. Rupert and Burton unlocking their treasure chests. Rupert has his, Burton has his. Who can complete the puzzle first? It is the flag right above your head. That's what you're trying to recreate. Burton and Lill making good progress. You both have the skull and crossbones. You're trying to figure out how to frame it. No need to force it, guys. Burton and Lill getting closer and closer. Only a few pieces away. Jon and Rupert catching up, going to have to hustle. Look at this-- down to the last piece. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Burton and Lill win reward! <br/>Oh, my God! All right, quit doing that Lill! Come on, now. <br/>Probst: Okay, here's the deal. Let's review. Catamaran, deep-sea fishing, pizza and beer on the boat. You can keep it for yourself. If you want to give it up to somebody else, you can do that, as  well. <br/>I want to keep this. Sorry, guys. <br/>Jon. <br/>Probst: All right, Lill's keeping her reward. Burton's giving his up to Jon. [ Jon mutters ]  You better drink a twelve-pack. <br/>I'm going to drink a case. <br/>Probst: Pizza and beer for Jon and Lill. Catamaran will pick you two up. Head on back. Good effort, everybody. <br/>Well, that reward challenge was not as fun as I had hoped. That was painful, painful, painful. <br/>I didn't want to give this reward to Rupert, because I  don't want Rupert to have any more food than he can, because, tomorrow, in  the immunity challenge, I want him to be tired, weak, injured and hobbling  around, because I want to smoke him. <br/>It's just the outside that stinks of rot and death. We had so much rot and death here. When Burton gave that away to Jon, and Lill kept it in her hand  without even thinking about it, that showed me that... I might not be as  secure as I am... as I think I am. Mean scum. The bastard's going to be ... [ mumbling ] [ panting ] Last ...  damn thing I give to Burton... except a vote. I may give him a few votes. Rot and death. <br/>Rupert deserves to go. [ indistinct chatter ] As much as he does around here... We're  living because of him. <br/>I'm sorry. <br/>About what? <br/>I should have sent you. I asked them, and they said no. <br/>Ah, it's okay, Lill. You need it, you earned it. you want it, bad. <br/>But that's not it. I went through the first one, I didn't win. [ sighs ]  You won, you should go. <br/>I feel like ...  No. <br/>I'm sorry. It's not right. You know it isn't, I know it isn't, and everybody else knows it  isn't. <br/>But what's done is done. <br/>I should have sent Rupert on this, and I didn't. Yeah, but I'm such a bitch. <br/>No, no. Thank God. <br/>Don't say that about God. [ sobbing  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. <br/>Rupert should go. Rupert would catch fish. I can't catch fish. We got to bring back fish. <br/>We're going to. What's... What's the big deal? We're going to. That's not a problem. We're bringing plenty of fish. They're gonna be happy. <br/>T and Sandra's looking at me like I'm a scum. I don't want to make anybody mad, I don't want to get anybody  upset, but I'm just not that good at the game. I don't go on vacations all the time. I can't afford to do these kind of things. If I had a chance to sail on a beautiful boat, that's what was  in my mind. I've never done anything like that before. <br/>Every single thing is hinging on yours and my  relationship. <br/>I know. <br/>And... I know it's a game, and I know it's  backstabbing...  Because there's no point. There's no way either one of us can beat anyone else as soon as  we go through with what we do tomorrow. There's no way. I know that. You know that. That's it. <br/>But, like... I'll admit, I am putting 100% of my faith in  you. You and I just have to control everything from here on out. And as long as the two of us can get Lill to vote with us,  there's three people. <br/>Oh, we're fine. <br/>And we're fine. Yes, all right. <br/>I heard Burton and Jon talking in the bushes. Jon is going to work his magic on Lill the whole boat ride. <br/>If they turn, we're all dead. If they...  It's not turning, it's just that they want her in the palm  of their hand. What kind of game is he going to play on her on the boat? <br/>It doesn't matter. Lill will come back, and I will talk to Lill. I talk to Lill every morning for hours. <br/>You going to ask her what they talked about? <br/>Yep. I'm going to ask her exactly what they talked about. And she will tell me. <br/>Lill? Time to go. <br/>Got to find out what's going on. My only hope is when Lill comes back, she looks me in the eye  and tells me what Jon is talking about. <br/>Oh, yes. <br/>Oh, my goodness. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Cheers. <br/>To the final three. <br/>To the final three. <br/>I have never ever been on anything anywhere near this  boat. Who's the captain? <br/>Hola, seÃ±or. El capitÃ¡n. Oh, you're glad you didn't give this bad boy up now, aren't you? <br/>I don't know, the ramifications...  There are no ramifications. I have everything worked out and we have all day to discuss it,  so you will have no more questions and there'll be no more talk at camp  between anybody. So, the only thing that can hurt us...  You just need to let me know what's going on. <br/>I'm going to tell you everything today, and when we leave  here, you will have no more questions. <br/>All right. You may have to tell me a couple times. <br/>Okay. Here's the deal. First: Rupert. If Rupert's not available, then Christa. <br/>Yeah, but I have a lot of guilt. You don't, I do. <br/>Please, you... you have to check that guilt at the door,  or else quit this game right now. Cheers. Are you happy? <br/>I'm happy. <br/>You should be, you're final three. <br/>I smell Cerveza. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Yes, sir! Thank you very much, sir. You drink beer, Lill? <br/>Not a whole lot. <br/>Well, I'll be happy to finish that for you. I think you know that. Oh, you're the man! <br/>Oh, my gosh! Oh! <br/>We got veggies over there, and we got a whole meat over  here. <br/>Simple-made things make me very excitable. [ laughs ]  I need to date women like you. <br/>Hey. <br/>Mmm...  Mmm...  This is the best part of this entire game. Right here. <br/>You know how much I like myself? Seeing how good I look right now is a great thing. Oh. Man. <br/>Square knot. I am the Scout Master. Woo-hoo! <br/>You're drunk, Lill. <br/>I've had three-quarters of a beer. <br/>I think you're drunk. <br/>What happens if I get one? <br/>I think you're drunk. <br/>What happens if I get one? <br/>Uh, reel it in. <br/>I would really like to bring some home. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Whoo-hoo. <br/>Any fish? <br/>Yeah. We fished the entire time. <br/>See, they kind of fished for us, and they threw out the  fishing hooks in the back and... nothing. <br/>Yeah, you just trolled around. When Jon and Lill came back from their catamaran, I just sucked  Lill in quickly and told her, "You stick with me and you could be top  two." You know, "It could be you and me." How many other times  have you been on the winning team? I tried to figure out what Jon was talking to her about and if  Jon was going to try and suck her in and get her in some kind of alliance. <br/>No, no. <br/>And she said "no." I know now that Lill will be  wholehearted with me. I wanted to hug and kiss her. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Okay. Rupert, for the second time, I take this away from you. Once again, Immunity back up for grabs. Okay, let's get to today's challenge. It is based on an old dart game called "Killer." Your  first goal: become a Killer, and you do that by hitting your own color on the  target. Once you're a Killer, you can start attacking other tribe  members. Each time a Killer hits another tribe member's color, they lose  one, two or three of their lives, depending if they're hit in the single, the  double or the triple section of the target. Once your lives are gone, you're out of the game. Last person left on the board... wins Immunity. To make it a little more fun, you won't be throwing darts...  you'll be using a blowgun. We'll draw numbers to pick your spot. We'll get started. First up: Lill. Get a lung full of air and make yourself a Killer. So, your goal is to hit your own color, activate your Killer  status. Not enough; going to need a little more air. Next up: T. Give it a good blow. <br/>Oh, that sucked. <br/>Probst: Darrah trying to hit her color. Nope. Jon. Rupert! Step up and show them how it's done. It's as easy as that-- Rupert is on the board as our first  Killer. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Burton looking to hit brown. Look at that! <br/>Good job, Burton. <br/>Probst: Burton follows right behind. Burton now a Killer. Sandra. You hit Sandra, but you're not a Killer. Doesn't count. There it is! Jon's on the board. Jon is a Killer. Rupert. Darrah takes two hits. You lose one life and you lose a second life; Darrah down to her  Safety. Burton gives T a hit. <br/>Ooh! <br/>Thank God. Sandra hits herself with a double and becomes a Killer. Good shot, but you're not a Killer-- doesn't count. Jon hits Christa with a triple. Christa, one life... two life... three life. <br/>My bad. <br/>Probst: Christa's out of the game, have a seat on the  bench. <br/>Sorry. <br/>That was quick. <br/>Probst: Darrah takes two hits, you lose your last life,  Darrah, have a seat next to Christa, you're out of the game. Burton has Killer status. Looking to put some pain on somebody. And he does with a triple on Rupert. Rupert loses Killer status... one life... and a second life. And with one hit, Rupert is down to one last life. [ mouths word ]  Probst: Rupert takes his last hit. Rupert, out of the game. T. takes a double hit. Rupert, out of the game. T. takes a double hit. T., you lose this life and you lose your last life, your Safety. T.is out of the game. Have a seat on the bench. <br/>He kills me again. <br/>Oh...  Son of a...  Probst: Burton hits a triple on Sandra. Sandra, now down to your last life. Sandra hits Burton. <br/>I wish that counted, too. <br/>Probst: But you're not a Killer. Burton hits Sandra and, just like that, Sandra loses her last  life. Take a seat on the bench. We're down to three: Jon, Lill, Burton. Burton gives a triple shot to Jon and, like that, Jon loses one  life... two life... and the third life. Jon, have a seat, you're out of the game. <br/>It was a pleasure having me. [ chuckles ]  Probst: Once again, we're down to a familiar pair: Lill  and Burton. Burton. All you have to do is hit light blue anywhere, Lill's out of the  game, you're going home with Immunity. Takes his aim. Lillian, out of the game. <br/>Oh, my heart. <br/>Probst: Burton wins Immunity-- again. Burton, come on over. You've had this around you before. <br/>I have. <br/>Probst: Turn around and put it on. Safe from tonight's vote. Three more days out here. Valuable Immunity. As you know, if you wish to assign it to somebody else, you can. You have this afternoon to think about it. You guys can head back to camp. <br/>Thank you. <br/>The immunity challenge pissed the hell out of me. I know I was clearly the best dart-blower there. And they knocked me out so damn quick. My own team, Burton and Sandra, knocked me out. Sandra truly was a mistake. I don't blame her at all. Burton, he knew what the hell he was doing. <br/>You and I, we'll go all the way. <br/>I know, dude. <br/>Like, I don't want to be in the final with anyone  else...  There's no one here. There's no one else. <br/>...for a number of reasons. But, if nothing else, I want to hang out with you that last day. <br/>Exactly. <br/>I want you and I partying our ass off. <br/>Exactly, man. I'm pretty happy right now in that, uh, Rupert's going home  tonight. Although, I promised him that I wouldn't write his name down  again, promises, to me, uh, can be broken about as easily as a fat woman on  wicker furniture. It's that simple. <br/>I love... I love shell collecting. I got tons of shells. <br/>Good therapy. <br/>Yes. <br/>What needs to be done? <br/>Shell collecting. <br/>I better get on my shell collecting, then. Burton and Jon keep pounding into my head-- this is a game! But I'd love to keep Rupert, because I love that man. <br/>It's the same. It's the same. It's the same. <br/>Yep. <br/>We target the Morgans first and we got to get Darrah and  Tijuana out before any of them, so they won't pass that damn immunity between  each other. Darrah is still acting like she's ready to go and packing and  saying her good-byes. But that could all be an act. Luckily, I have Lill on my side, I have Sandra on my side and I  have Christa on my side. Lill has been the key figure in a lot of votes lately. Is it still going to be Darrah? <br/>Uh, I don't care. I... I've said from the get-go, it doesn't make ... to me. <br/>Okay. Okay. I'm going to go get dressed. If they've turned and they've gotten Darrah, T, Jon and Burton  together on one side, I've got my four on my side and we will have a tie. We five stand strong together. <br/>That was my point the whole time. <br/>Burton said "yeah." I want to see Sandra say  "yeah" and look at me. <br/>I'm good. <br/>I want to see you say "yeah."  I'll give you a "hell, yeah."  The vibe at the camp is that everybody's agreed upon  Darrah going home. Maybe Burton figured out that there was a way between him and  Jon to get together and outmaneuver us three. But I don't see it happening. I just can't see it happening, because all along they've said,  "It's going to be the strong five and we'll separate from  there."  Probst: We'll now bring in the first member of the jury,  Ryno. Voted out at the last Tribal Council. Ryno is here merely to observe. He's just gathering information to help him make a very  important vote at the final Tribal Council. Okay. 27 days-- that's a long time to be out here. Sandra, is there anybody in this tribe you couldn't survive  without? Why Rupert? <br/>Rupert is the only one that brings fish, with the  exception of the one that Burton brought. But Burton brings in stingrays. Um, we'd be assed-out if it wasn't for Rupert, assed-out. <br/>Probst: Lill, how important is Rupert's fish-catching  abilities? <br/>It is very important to us, but we also have another  person who does do fishing. <br/>Probst: Burton, is there or is there not a little competition  to be the alpha male between you and Rupert? <br/>No, I don't believe so. I mean, Rupert has definitely caught more fish than I have. But there's no doubt in my mind that if one of us got struck by  lightning, the tribe would get by. <br/>Probst: Sandra, you have become your own society, complete  with leaders and followers. Who here is getting a free ride? <br/>Let it be known that Jon wakes up at noon and then he goes  under the bushes. He has this secret spot where he takes an additional nap. I have yet to see him wash a dish or even clean a fish. <br/>Probst: Jon, she pointed a big, old, fat finger at you. <br/>That's fine. She gives me a headache. So, I could care less. It's all about her. <br/>Probst: What's that, Jon? <br/>It's all about her. <br/>Probst: Okay. Darrah, you seem like you've given up to me. If you're going home tonight, surprised? No, not surprised at all. <br/>Probst: Disappointed? <br/>Um, yeah, disappointed, but not surprised. <br/>Probst: All right, guys. Burton, you have immunity. It's yours to keep or give away to somebody else, if you want  to. Uh, I think I'll keep it. <br/>Probst: All right. That being said, Burton cannot be voted for tonight. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Christa, you're up. <br/>A Morgan has to go tonight. Christa, you're up. <br/>A Morgan has to go tonight. And the other two work harder than you do. <br/>To be the man, you got to beat the man. Woo! <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the Woo! <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Darrah. Darrah. Two votes Darrah. Jon. Two votes Darrah, one vote Jon. Rupert. One vote Rupert. Rupert. Two votes Rupert, two votes Darrah. Rupert. That's three votes Rupert, two votes Darrah, one vote Jon. Rupert. That's four votes Rupert. Ninth person voted out of the tribe-- Rupert. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>I cannot believe that. <br/>Probst: Rupert, the tribe has spoken. You guys can head spoken. You guys can head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. Next time on Survivor: Jon is stunned with some devastating  news. <br/>Love you, Jonny. <br/>I love you, guys. <br/>Probst: While a member of the tribe does the unthinkable. <br/>We can't sabotage the tribe. <br/>I didn't do it. <br/>That was the most idiotic thing I've... I've seen since  this game has begun. I got nothing to say to either one of you. <br/>Well, ... you, too.

I always get hurt trusting people. I want so badly to be accepted and I never get the acceptance  that I want. I don't fit. So much for my dreams.
