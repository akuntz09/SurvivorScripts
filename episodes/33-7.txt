<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," at the ika bula  tribe, Sunday and Bret were outnumbered by the millennials. <br/>See you later, ge gen-xers. <br/>Jeff: And Zeke was zrting to grow closer to the gen-xers. <br/>It might be necessary for meã     tribe. <br/>Jeff: Adam had to decide whether to vote with the  millennial couple or to trust the gen-xers. <br/>I would never put you  name down. <br/>The question is which side is going to be better for my  future in this game. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Adam and the gen-xersã§ã³ voted  ou Taylor's girlfriend.Ã±r Figgy, the tribe has spoKen. <br/>Good luck, tay. <br/>Jeff: 14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight. Who will be voted out tonight. Grand plan of how you want to do this in the future. <br/>Oh, my gosh, tribal sucked, to the max. I can't trust these people like I could figs. Just the comfort of having her around, the smiles, the high  spirit in camp. For me figs was the light, and camp is just kind of gray right  now. <br/>It was a lose-lose situation for me. I did what I thought was least best, and maybe I messed up. <br/>But that affects me, as well. <br/>Of course it does. Of course it does. Yeah, I screwed you. I lied to you, and I screwed you. 100%. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I admit that. I feel badly that I ended their island romance, but I did what I  needed to do. I put myself in a position where I can move forward with a group  of gen x-ers and Figgy was ultimately the sacrifice that had to happen. <br/>You are now in a worst position than you were before. <br/>Yep, yeah. <br/>And that's my fault. And I admit that. <br/>Ã±r I’m beyondã±r pissed at Adam this is a total game of  revenge. I'll keep my cool forãI now, but when it comesã±rã§ã³ time, I will  destroy you. <br/>Make a decision? <br/>Cooking as always. <br/>It's easy when it's hot. <br/>Sitting on the beach with the Vanua tribe, I’m thinking,  if we lose next immunity, Michelle is absolutely who we would vote out of  this game, but I would not put it past Chris to try the pull fast one andã§ã³  vote me out instead of Michelle, but I feel like I do have a tighter bond  than I do with Chris, and frankly I think we're cut from the same cloth. I'm a paranoid guy. Let me know if anybody is coming up behindãI me. I'm thinking I could show him my idol. That would establish a tremendous amount of trust. I hate sharing knowledge I have an idol. It's a very risky move or it's a great move. You just really never know. Zeke, I trust you a lot. <br/>I trust you, too. <br/>I’m going to tell you  something that I don't want you to tell anybody else. <br/>You have an idol? <br/>I found it the very next  day. <br/>That's very good. Great. <br/>Please do not share that with anyone. <br/>It doesn't behoove me. <br/>I want to go to the end  with you. That's my truth. <br/>David told me that he had a hidden immunity idol. Which I was just delighted to hear. Right? Because if you can't have a hidden immunity idol, it's good that  a person you're very close to has a hidden immunity idol. <br/>You're literally the only person in this game other than  myself that knows I have the idol. <br/>Dude, your secret is safe with me. I think David and I could have a future in this game together. He's put his life in my hand, and I’m going to take very, very  good care of his life. For the time being. For the time being. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: Vanua and ika bula getting your first look at the  new Takali tribe. Figgy voted out at the last tribal council. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Wow. <br/>Wow. <br/>Figgy. <br/>Figs. <br/>Jeff: So many different reactions. Michaela, at the last immunity challenge, you looked at this  tribe and you said, if you can't figure it out with three millennials, that's  down to you. <br/>It's been been time for Figgy to go home for a while, so  bye, pi -- felicia. <br/>Jeff: Wow. Taylor, surprised to hear that? <br/>No comment. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge you're going to work together  to unwinding and release three balls. You'll then shoot the balls into a basket and push them through  a rope tunnel. Once you have all three balls, you'll attempt to land them on a  perch. First two tribes to finish win reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First tribe to finish, you will have a chef come to  your camp and cook for you. You will sit back and enjoy chicKen, garlic shrimp, some salad,  and finish itã§ã³ off with cheesecake. <br/>Oh. <br/>God.Ã±r  No way. <br/>Jeff: Second tribe to finish, kebabs and you got to cook  it yourself,ã§ã³ but it will taste good. Third tribeãI to finish, nothing ika bula, you have two extra  members. Who are you going to sit out in this challenge?Ã§ã³  Bret and I are goingãI to sit out. <br/>Jeff: Bret and Sunday, grab a seat on the bench. Everybody else take a second to strategize and we'll get  started. All right. Here we go. For reward, Survivors ready?Ã§ã³ go!Ã§ã³ã±r you got to work  togetherã§ã³ to release those balls. Cannot stand on the structure. Everybody looking good. It's Zeke, Jay and Adam. <br/>Put them on your shou&amp;  Jeff: It's like a tether ball. Jay now standing on the shoulders of his tribe mates, and it is working.ÃI  Adam now getting some momentum going. <br/>All right. Here. <br/>Jeff: Got to spin it over. It takes some strength to get that thing moving. <br/>Underneath, underneath. Push, push. <br/>Jeff:ã§ã³ Zeke struggling. Zeke takes a big fall. Z now. David going up. Jay is Takali releases. David struggling just as much as Zeke. Quickly falling behind in this challenge.ÃI  Come on. <br/>Jeff: Now you have to uk those knots to release your ball,  and they finally have it. Go, David, keep digging. Ika bula has been in the lead from the beginning. Here comes Vanua. There you go, start untying. Release those balls. It is Jay shooting for ika bula. Ken going to be shooting now. Ken scoresã§ã³ firstã±r for Takali. It is now Jessica and Adam working to get that ull through the  ropes. You can't shoot again until that ball is through the net. Ika bula still working onã±r thei first. Chris shooting for Vanua. They are closing that gap. It is now Zeke and m[cjelle working to release that ball. Jay scores. It is now will and Hannah trying to maneuver that ball. Michelle and Zeke, they made up a lot of time very quickly. Go, Chris. Chris fires another one. That's good. Extending the lead fo&amp;/ Vanua. Go, Takali. Zeke and Michelle have got this figured out. They are moving very fast.ÃI go, Chris. Vanua once again in the lead. Go, Jay.ÃIã±r he has his second. <br/>Punch it! <br/>Ken for the third. Just short. Chris scores again. That's the third ball for Vanua. Once it's released, you can move to that third and final stage. There you go. The third u Takali. What did m[cjelle and Zeke figure out that nobody else can,  because that is the difference in this challenge. Chris going to shoot for Vanua. He's got to land allã±r three bal on top of the perch to win. Ika bula still working with the second ball, way behind. Chris lands his first one for Vanua. There it is. Go, go, Takali. Will and Hannah get that second ball through. Chris lands the second. One ball left. Jay now with the third and final ball for ika bula. <br/>You got it. You got time. <br/>Jeff: Ken in and out. Ken has the first one. Chris could win it right here for Vanua and he does. Huge rewardãI for Vanua Ken tryi to finish second for Takali. And will and Hannahã§ã³ are still working that ball. Here comes Jay and Michaela. Can they get back in this? It's Michaela shooting for ika bula. Ken trying the land that second. <br/>Nice job, Michaela. <br/>Jeff: Michaela trying to make up a huge loss of time. Michaela has first and now we are tied. It would be a huge comeback from ika bula to pull this out and  win the kebabs. Ken lands the second for Takali. He's gone one left. <br/>Don't hit the other one. Take your time. <br/>Jeff: Michaela lands the second. We are tied. This is it. One ball left. Ken versus Michaela. Michaela pulls it out for ika bula! Huge come-from-behind victory. <br/>Good job. <br/>Jeff: Vanua, nice reward. Cook a lot of food, get those bellies full. Enjoy it. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. Have a good afternoon. <br/>Jeff: Michaela once again coming in strong. Nice victory for ika bula. Come grab your kebabs have. A good afternoon. Hopefully you got some fire and you can cook them up. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: All right, Takali, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>To come from ahead to behind to ahead again and get that  second place, on the one hand I was happy because we got skewers, but on the  other hand it makes me nervous when I help the team win because I don't want  peopleãI thinking that I’m the one to beat. <br/>Oh, my goodness. <br/>Walking into camp after winning reward and seeing the chef  with his barbecue, his grill and all his fixings, it was such a relief. Wow. Oh, that's fantastic. <br/>Jeff completely undersold it. This is food I would talk about in a restaurant in l.A. <br/>I’m not stopping. <br/>Oh, boy. <br/>This game requires you to change and adapt. I spent most of my youth on a diet, so I always am watching what  I eat, but out here I pile food on to my plate. I funnel it directly into my mouth, and I just kept going, because  the more calories I can eat now, the longer it's going to benefit me. And because of my inner fat kid, I could binge, baby. <br/>I have to take a break. I've never eaten that much food that fast in my life. <br/>The three guys turn entered a bunch of animals an we're  just scraping food off the plate. Michelle was eating with her knife and fork like a human. [farting] gas is just taking away space for food. [burping]  By the end of the meal, all I’m hearing is bodily  functions and noises coming from the guys sitting next to me. It got gross and annoying. I don't eat like that. My mom taught meã±r manners, but now I am a littleãI nervous  because me being the only girl, I could be an easy vote, but I’m not going to  change who I am for the game. <br/>Everything about every part of our daily lives is affected  by policy, and that policy is created by officials that we elect or don't  elect. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I've noticed that so many people in my generation don't  care. <br/>I hate talking about  politics. You know, no matter what, one group of people is nq to be happy. I'm not so concerned with who is going to be president. I just really don't want to put my hope in politics. <br/>I do think my generation  is going to change things so drastically, just things that we've realized  that are not of use anymore, like the electoral vote. <br/>Taylor is classic millennial. He's so honest with his answers. He might not always sound theãI brightest, but you like him  just the same because he'll give you the answer that is truly the answer. Let me ask you a question, Adam promised you and Figgy he'll  never write your name down, and then he wrote fig yes's name down. <br/>ÃI 100%. So I know you got to do what you got to do, but come merge, like  I haveã±r no allegiance and I wou shake your hands right nowã§ã³ and say that  I won't vote your name down. I won't write it down. <br/>That's good to know. <br/>I'll never be writing down the nameãI Jessica, an I'll  neve be writing down the name Ken. <br/>Thank you. I appreciate that. That means a lot. <br/>We have Taylor who wouldn't understand strategy if you  tried to explain it to him, so maybe what he tells us is a little more  reliable than what we're getting from Adam, who is more strategic. So Ken and I are just taking in all the information we're being  provided. If we don't win, it's going to be a huge decision, and we need  to make the right one. To make the right one. The 20th day, folks. <br/>The 20th day. <br/>Over the hump. <br/>Man those bupgs were insane last night. <br/>Awful, awful. <br/>I just told myself, Michaela,  you don't feel anything crawling on you. It's your imagination. It's just a fly buzzing, but he doesn't bite. Let him buzz, Michaela. Let him buzz. I've been on this island 20 days. I'm half-way through, but I’m a strongã±r girl, probably theãI strongest  girl on this tribe. That issue is in your mind,ã±r girl. I know I’m a pretty intense person. Steve jobs was pretty intense. Michael jordan is pretty intense. It's like Michaela bradshaw is pretty intense. That's what makes us winners, so if you can't handle it, you  can't handle my heat, get out of the kitchen. <br/>Excellent day. <br/>We're trying to keep ourselves united soã§ã³ we can kee  winning. Of course this is all sort of a mirage, because there are four  millennials and two gen xers. Sunday is so sweet. <br/>I2hcve one thawnt calls me sunny. She's the only one allow. <br/>But Bret feels suspicious to me. What do you do again? <br/>I'mã±r a funeral director.ÃI I run the funerals and try  the make the families as comfortable as possible. <br/>I want the cast doubt  about Bret because I think he's lying about his funeral directing. <br/>I help them pick out a  casket and all that stuff. Pretty straightforw  ÃI isn't it emotional? <br/>Yeah, but like anything, you get used to it. It's kind of morbid. <br/>So I’m sitting there minding my own business, so Hannah  starts asking me about the funeral home business. <br/>One family at a time, how does it work? <br/>You make appointments and sit down and talk about funerals  and stuff like that. I hate to lie to her, but I know the history of Survivor. Police officers don't generally do well. So I’m going to stick to my guns. <br/>Can I say something about Bret? I'm like 70% sure he's a cop. I grew up in boston. I'm like pretty sure he's a cop. I think I might have just interrogated a cop. Bret talks like a cop, walks like a cop, but more than that for  me, it's about making the other three millennials be sketched out by these  two really sweet gen xers. I want the four of us to stay tight. I feel like if it came down to a vote and I was like, hey, dude,  I’m pretty sure you're a cop, where my vote is going is all about trust and  honesty...  If he is a cop, let him reveal that. Don't forhis hand or else he'll get really uncomfortable. <br/>A funeral is so specific that you would never think to  question it. That's the thing. <br/>Yeah. I grew up in boston, though. He sounds like every cop I've ever met. Is that dumb? <br/>I think he's a cop, too. <br/>Bret says he's a funeral director, but the thing, is I know  florida cops, and honestly, if you took away his accent, put him in a  uniform, put him in florida, he would be someone that I’m running away from  every time I start a bonfire on the beach. <br/>Keep doing your little investigation, what do you do  exactly. <br/>He's too funny and too lively to be a funeral director,  and it matters if he's a cop because he's already lying in my face. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys.ÃI all right. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First things first, you novi the take them back. <br/>I know. <br/>Jeff: Thank you davi"V Sunday. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to race to throw coconuts  into a net. Once your net is heavy enough, a flag will drop revealing  numbers. Those numbers will release a key. That key will unlock a slingshot.Ã§ã³ you will then fire sapped  bags attempting to knock down targets. First two tribesãI to finish win immunity, safe from the vote. Losers tribal council, whereã§ã³ somebody will be the seventh  person voted out of this game. Ika bula, you have two extra members. Sitting two peopleã±r out. Bret and Sunday sat out last time. Who isãI it going to be this tim  Me and william. <br/>Hannah and will going to sit this one out. Everybody else take a spot on the bench. Everyone else take a minute the strategize and we'll start. All right. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, guys, let's go. <br/>Jeff: First phase very simple. Throw coconuts into a met. Ken misses. Jay just misses. <br/>Go, go, go. Keep going, keep going. <br/>Jeff: Chris nothing but net. Michaela knocks it in. Taylor taking a shot now. Taylor connects. You're just looking to get enough coconuts in that it will drop  that flag. So far it's in the as easy as it looks. You have to get the hang of it. Sunday with a nice shot. David a little short. Vanua struggling a bit. Chris just misses. Adam nails one for Takali. Jessica with a nice shot. Ken scores. Takali's net getting fuller. Ika bula's net getting fuller. Jay scores. Ika bula has not lost a challenge yet as a tribe. They don't want to start here. Michaela connectsã±r for ika bula you're going to start to get  your rhythm now. <br/>There you go. GetãI it, David! <br/>David finally connects. Adam on fire. Takali getting to that point now where it will just take one or  two more coconuts. Where is that tipping point? Everybody is very close. There it goes. Takali, go. Adam now going to use the numbers to try to release the key. He's got to find the right combination of pairs of numbers. What order do they go in? And it's not right. Missed opportunity. Jay fires and scores. Ika bula getting closer. Adam tries it.Ã§ã³ he's got it. Go! Adam can now unlock the slingshot. Ika bula getting closer. Is it going to drop? This will do it. There it is. It's going. Michaela has the numbers. She's heading out now. <br/>47, 18,ãI 32. <br/>Jeff: Adam has the slingshot unlocked. Takali canã±r start firingãI sand now trying to knock down  targets. Taylor going to give it a go. Just to the left. Michaela working on the pairs and numbers. Got to release that key. She's got it. Let's go, ika bula. Here comes Michaela looking to unlock the slingshot. Taylor just misses. Vanua is dead last. Here comes Zeke.ÃI will that do it? Yes, that's going to drop it. Can they get it done? Can they catch up? Michelle now working on those pairs trying to release the keys. This is one of those challenges you can catch up fast. <br/>Okay, go. <br/>Go, go, you have to make a decision and stay with it. <br/>Jeff: Michelle trying to figure out the pairs, what order  do they go in, and it'sã§ã³ not right. Bret fires. Just short. Ken now firing. Just misses. Michelle trying another combo. That's not right. Switch them around. <br/>Just keep going through them. <br/>Jeff: There are six combinations. You have to try all six to find it.ÃIã§ã³ the first target for Takali. Michaela cannot connect on a target, which is keeping the door  open for Vanua.ÃI  You want to switch? <br/>No. <br/>Okay. Ken knocks the second target down.Ã§ã³ Takali now with two. Here comes Jay. <br/>You guys, I've tried everything. Michelle finally gets it after a long time Taylor connects with  the third. That is three Takali. Ika bula still with nothing. Vanua now trying to get on the board.ÃI Chris launches. Yes. And he hits the first target for Vanua. Vanua was in dead last, and nay are now right back in this.Ã§ã³ Jay  scores for ika bula. Ken scores for Takali. That is four for Takali. One each for ika bula and Vanua. <br/>Let 'em fly, Chris, let 'em fly. <br/>Jeff: Takali down to their last target for immunity. Ken can do it right here. <br/>ÃI Kenny. There you go. That's the one! <br/>Jeff: And he does. Ken wins immunity for Takali. No tribal council. We're looking for second place.Ã  Come on, Zeke. <br/>Jeff: Come on, Zeke. Huge stakes. You do not want to go to tribal council. Zeke connects for Vanua that. Is two targets Vanua, one ika bula. Here comes Bret. And he gets it. Ika bula and Vanua both with three targets remaining. Here comes Jay. Jay just misses. Chris coming back in for Vanua. Chris nothing but wood on that. Vanua now in the lead with only two targets left. <br/>Come on, Michaela. <br/>Jeff: It is Michaela and Chris now. Chris lines it up and does it again. Chris hits another. Michaela does not know what it's like the lose with this tribe. It would be a bad time to find out.Xd big fail. Chris for the win sending ika bula to tribal council. <br/>You got it, Chris. <br/>Jeff: Chris going deep and he does it. Vanua wins immunity, sending ika bula to tribal council for the  first time. Takali, nicely done. Nobody going home from this tribe. Vanua, nice job. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Nobody going home from Vanua. Takali, congratulation, enjoy the night off. This tribe stays intact. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Vanua, nice come from behind.4&amp; grab your stuff,  head back to camp. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Sunday, you're going to go back to camp. Will it be seconds or minutes before the paranoia sets in and  you guys start scrambling? <br/>I’m going the say minutes  because we're all going to try the play it cool, and then within minutes we  turn on the paranoia button. <br/>Jeff: All right. Ika bula, tribal council tonight. Somebody will be the seventh person voted out. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>The millennials have to. Come together and decide if it's Bret and Sunday, but  considering Bret keeps lying, sorry, Bret, but you're going to have to go  home. <br/>For us to lose felt like getting punched in the stomach. We actually all sat in silence for like at least half an hour  because we genuinely like each other. Bret and I looked at each other, and it was like, crap, it's one  of us. I just had to hold back tears because I’m in the used to being  in a position where other people are deciding my fate, but that's "Survivor."  we both know it. Sorry. <br/>You have to put my name and you have to -- I have to put  your name, unless we can come up with another plan. <br/>Me and Sunday said we will not right our name down, but  tonight we have to break that promise. She agreed. It sucks, because if you vote for anyone else, they're going to  gun for you. <br/>We have to do it that way. I hate it. <br/>Me too. <br/>It stinks not to have your fate in your own hand, but  that's this game. There's going to be times when you're at the whim of everyone  you're on the island with, but it is "Survivor" and you never know  what's going to happen. <br/>So I played out a scenario in my mind. This is our final four. These are the other tribes. Two millennials, two gen xers, and then this is the person that  survived the vote. I'm about to show you why it doesn't matter who we pick. We still got four votes. One of these people go home, a gen xer and we're back like this. I pulled the millennials together. And I used some rocks to lay out a plan, just showing it doesn't  matter really who stays and who goes if we play these numbers right. <br/>Bret might be a cop. <br/>He might be a cop. <br/>We could split the votes tonight in case there is an idol  played. <br/>So we'll split the votes and all Bret the second time  in  Cool. <br/>This split-vote plan is just in case an idol is played. So the girls are going to vote for Bret. The boys will vote for Sunday. That would make it a tie. And then we'll revote and hopefully vote for Bret. <br/>Michaela's got seashells like a football play. She's like, okay, post-merge we're eliminating this person, and  then she's like, there will be four seashells left, which is us, and Michaela's  a smart girl. So that's the problem. <br/>Tribal council is nothing to be afraid of. You want to go the tribal council more than anyone else in the  game. This is the reason I like this tribe, because I feel like you  all are three people I can trust in the game. I don't feel like there are three other people in this game I can  trust. <br/>She is a huge threat. She's good at competition, she's a smart chick, so I have this  epiphany of saying, boop, Michaela should go home, before the merge. <br/>I start thinking about  it. Maybe we should send Michaela home. She is fricKen smart. She's breaking it down person by person. <br/>She's like, we'll get rid of this person and that person,  like two gen xers and one millennial. I'm like, dude, you're thinking way too far ahead. <br/>Michaela is so intelligent. Every time I have a conversation with her about this game, she  thinks about it methodically. I need to wait for the right time to vote her out, because I really  like Michaela, she's a great, positive vibe to have around camp, and I don't  think any of us want to see her go. <br/>I’m playing devil's  advocate. She knows you have the idol. That's scary, too. You have a point. Maybe we'll vote for Michaela. <br/>If we tell Hannah, she'll freak out. If we don't tell Hannah, she'll freak out later. <br/>I'd rather not tell her. I trust Michaela. She hasn't lied. Michaela's only alliance is us. You want to vote tonight? <br/>I’m nervous. Michaela is a great alliance, and I have been with her since day  one. And I still don't trust Bret. It's crazy when you make a big move because you're thinking, is  this the right rodge cal thing to do? "Survivor" is not a joke. This decision tonight could honestly mold the rest of my game  either for a win or for a loss. I'm freaking out. <br/>Jeff: So ika bula, first time at tribal council, both the  other tribes have been here, and in meth cases the majority voted out one of  their own. Michaela, seeing that, where is your level of trust with the  millennials? <br/>My thoughts tonight are based on the people that I’m with. The majorities in the other two tribes are full of sketchy  people, and sketchy people can't be relied on, but the nice thing about being  on ika bula is all six of us are pretty trustworthy people. <br/>Jeff: Jay, surprise you the other tribals have gone the  way they have with the majority taking out one of their own? <br/>Yeah, for sure. Seeing that millennials took out millennials, we're wondering,  what are you guys doing or even gen x had the majority and and t did the same  thing. Sunday, at the challenge, you said, how long before the scrambling  starts. You said about two minutes. Were you close? <br/>Actually no. We sat on one log lined up together not saying a single word. <br/>Jeff: Even Michaela? <br/>Even Michaela. <br/>Jeff: So Michaela, the six of you are sitting on a log. What are you thinking about? <br/>How it sucks that the ika bula six are forced to drop down  to five. Like we genuinely like each other. This is Bret and mama Sunday. We're tight. We would have took over this whole game if you let us all go to  the merge. <br/>Jeff: It's always my fault, isn't it? <br/>You did it. We didn't ask for slingshots. <br/>Jeff: Sunday, does it work against you that the four  millennials might say, it's not that we don't trust Sunday or Bret, it's that  they know other people that we don't know. With these four, I know I can trust them. We've been together since day one. <br/>Absolutely. Bret and I are well aware we are on the outs. They've didn't a fabulous job trying to make us not feel on the  outs, but it is 4-2. <br/>Jeff: Bret, if there's any good news, it's that the other  two tribes have the majority and they voted out one of their own, so you got  to be thinking, I could make this happen again tonight. <br/>Hey, I’m game for anything like that, Jeff. Let's get it going. But I'm... They know who I am. They know what kind of person I am, and they know I’m being  general uniwith them. So if there's anything that can help me, let's do it. <br/>Jeff: Will, when you look at how the game has evolved  going back to when you were born, as important as trust is, is it possible that  game play has just surpassed it and it really is temporary alliances and  voting blocs and I don't mind blind siding anybody at any time because I’m playing  maverick game? <br/>The game you described is dangerous. People recognize if you're playing crazy, guns-ablazing like  that. And in a game where trust is a rare commodity, any time you can  find that with anybody, you latch on the it, because that might be what will  get you to the end of this game. <br/>Jeff: So Jay, does it come down to a gut if you look at Bret  versus Sunday in  Yeah, you got to follow your gut. So if your gut is telling you one thing, just go with it, man. Because that's all you got honestly. <br/>Jeff: Michaela, what does it come down to for you? <br/>The merge has to come soon. It just comes down to who do we think can make it all the way to  five with us. <br/>Jeff: So will, predict the future. After tonight's vote, you go back to camp, what kind of tribe  will you have? <br/>I think we're going to  have five strong, trustworthy people moving forward in this game. <br/>Jeff: Jay, do you agree with that? Will tonight's vote make this tribe stronger? <br/>If I could tell the future, Jeff, I think so, because then  the bonds will only grow from that point forward. <br/>Jeff: Michaela, after tonight's vote, is this tribe broKen  or stronger? <br/>Definitely stronger, but I hope that tonight no one feels  at the bottom. This is something we didn't plan for, but it's a part of the  game  Who would feel at the bottom? Whichever one of these great people here that doesn't go home. But that's no what I want. <br/>Jeff: So based on what I’m hearing, we have a group of  people who truly trust each other or somebody is about to get blind sided. It is time to vote. Hannah, you're up. <br/>I wish I could have gone  further with you. <br/>I wish I could have gone  further with you. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked the leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote Bret. Bret. Two votes Bret. Michaela. Two vets Bret, one vote Michaela. Michaela. Two votes Bret, two votes Michaela. Michaela. <br/>What? <br/>Jeff: That's three votes Michaela, two votes Bret, one  vote left. <br/>Did you do that? <br/>I did not do that. <br/>Jeff: Seventh person voted out, Michaela. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Jay. Damn, Jay. You just...  What? What? <br/>Jeff: Michaela, the tribe has spoKen. <br/>I feel like an ass. Damn, Jay. <br/>Jeff: Well, it was going to be trust or blindside. It turns out the one who was preaching trust the most is the one  who was blind sided. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor," the merge has  arrived. <br/>I now is when you start  destroying hopes and dreams. <br/>Jeff: And gen x is outnumbered. <br/>We have to get the millennials gone. <br/>But Hannah wants payback. I can't trust Jay. I hope I can get my freakin' revenge. <br/>I’m pretty pissed off. I think it was the dumbest decision. My focus was the end, and I’m not even at the merge. Had Jay been able to control his paranoia, this group of four  would have made it to the end. We would have ran this thing together and somebody would have  walked away with a million bungs. But oh well, I’m goingã±r to get rich some way.
