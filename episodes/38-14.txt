<br/>Jeff: It's the "Survivor: Edge of Extinction"  reunion show where Chris has just won $1 million. Congratulations. I know it's still sinning in. I want to get right into it. The two big moves really centered around Devens, honoring the  loyalty, which kept you in it and gave you a fighting shot, which you just  heard him talk about earlier, and then you saying, this is my game, and I got  to play my game. Is there, when you watch that back, knowing what you made is a  legit move, even Devens said so, it's good game play, is there any  "Survivor" guilt? Does it haunt you at all this it took that to do that to Devens  to put yourself in that spot? <br/>Well, it was -- I don't think there was any doubt in my  mind. I knew I had to do that. So from a game play standpoint, there was no guilt. I know that all these players, they're so good. If they were in my situation, they would have done the same  thing. Devens was such a good player. I told him, too, I said, dude, if you win, you got my vote. So it was just matter of who would come out on top. <br/>Jeff: So are you guys good? Are you friends? <br/>If he hadn't won a million dollars, it would be up in the  air, but, yeah, now we're friends, absolutely. <br/>Jeff: Well, he's a good dude. <br/>Jeff: One relationship that remained loyal throughout was Devens  and David. David, you were always great. I got to thank you for the analogy, because like the pilot and  the passenger, those things are so helpful because they make the show relatable  in a different way. You can attach a meaning to it. So give me one now, having spent time on extinction and having  had the chance to go home, what -- do you have any perspective on what is  that for people who can't imagine how that's even worse than "Survivor."  You know, I guess it would be like if you showed up at a  restaurant that was completely out of food, and you still walked out with a  completely full belly. I don't know what kind of tip you would leave, but it was an  unbelievable experience being out there. <br/>Jeff: And I really felt like we genuinely have watched you  mature. <br/>Yeah, you have. Oh, God. Yeah, yeah. Quite like a baby. Yeah, no, you have. <br/>Jeff: Even down to having a relationship that you talked  about. <br/>Oh, David. <br/>I'm sorry. But I love you so much. You talked to her. She's sitting out there. I proved in with her, and it's -- it's awesome to see. It really is. <br/>Jeff: By the way, a quick update, David is now writing on  a show for cbs, "Star trek," and cochran is writing on it with him,  which has got to be the craziest writers' room. <br/>It's insane. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth, Kelley, I never say Kelley. Wentworth, what is it that keeps you coming back? <br/>There are a lot of things. I think one of the main things is I'm very competitiven I'm a  very stRong woman. I think there is this weird desire to like be this positive  influence on a lot of women out there. And so I just want to be this representative who is like I will  never give up. Ly always be stRong. I can still be emotional and still be a stRong woman, and I will  do it for you. It sounds really strange, but I feel like I'm representing. <br/>Jeff: It doesn't sound strange. <br/>I want people out there, especially girls who are  teenagers, I want them to feel like they can do whatever they want to do. <br/>Jeff: Love it. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: I love that. And I love that we got to see emotion from you, because you  actually let us in for just a second. <br/>I don't normally do that. But you can be stRong and emotional. You don't have to fit in any sort of box. Be who you want to be. <br/>Jeff: Well said. Julie, you were actually the opposite. You went... I feel like you went from soft to tough. That was part of your mission. Do you feel "You are my friend" accomplished it? You made it to the end. You wanted to show yourself and your family, I'm more than who  you might think of as mom or the wife? <br/>Yeah, playing this game was the hardest thing I've ever  done, but also the most amazing thing I've done all at the same time. I definitely came on "Survivor" to prove to pietion  and to my kids and my family and friends at home that I can push myself  further than I ever have. In those 39 days, that's exactly what I did. Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Gavin, I only have one question: You were so  obsessed with "Survivor" that you moved your wedding. So now that you have made it to the end, got four votes, that is  a lidge la jet "Survivor" performance. Is this obsession gone? Can you move on now? <br/>The obsession isn't gone, but now I can shut up to my  parents and my wife about how I need to play. And now I can focus on -- and I didn't win -- but in my mind,  whenever I was leaving final tribal council, I knew I was a winner because I  knew they were going to be waiting on me at the airport. So no matter what, I learned so much from this experience. <br/>Jeff: I want the share something, because sometimes being  backstage is even crazier than the finale you're watching, especially if your  friend is sia. We happen to have a super fan who is sia, this global pop star. She just loves "Survivor." every season she created  her own award, the sia award, which she gives to the person she was most  entertained by. And I'm happy to say Rick devon, the sia award goes to you? <br/>I can't believe it right now. That's amazing. <br/>Jeff: I think you could --  Thank you, sia! <br/>Jeff: It is a very nice award. It is $100,000. And the reason is, I want to be really clear, because this  sounds crazy, this is the truth, sia says, I have been so lucky in my life. I like to share my success, and I get a lot of enjoyment from  the show. There you go. Wow. How do we top that? We'll take a break. A lot more to come, including what we're doing next season,  which is super cool. We'll be right back. <br/>Jeff: "Survivor" reunion will continue only on  cbs. <br/>Jeff: Welcome back to the "Survivor: Edge of  Extinction" live reunion show. Reem, I didn't know, who knows if we would have even had an Edge  of Extinction season if you had not, going there first, been the one to stay. There I just want to say, you had a brutal tribal. Then you go to a brutal first night where your torch goes out. The rain is coming down. You took it on the chin. You stayed out there for 32 days. I want to acknowledge. I hope you're proud and that your kids and your family are as  proud of yourself as you are. Are they? <br/>I hope so. I think so. I didn't come out here to not do it for a reason if I left them  and I left everything. There had to be something behind it. So I wasn't going the leave. I didn't care what anyone said to me. And I didn't care how miserable I was. I was never ever ever -- sorry. Dammit. <br/>Jeff: I can get you out of it. Dude. Dude. Just whatever, dude. Come on, toughen up. <br/>It's all good. It's all good. <br/>Jeff: Well, we appreciate you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: And Wendy, Wendy, I have to say. <br/>Hi. <br/>Jeff: So many people talked about one aspect, not the  chickens, not the flint, but your absolute comfort in being vulnerable with  your tourettes. Have you had especially -- have you heard from people, and even  now as it's happening, you just continue to smile through it. Has that inspired? Have you heard people say you're helping them? <br/>I feel like coming on the show, I have never been ashamed  or embarrassed about it. So I'm completely normal with it. So during that challenge I was completely normal. But then when people started messaging me saying I inspired  them, I never came out here to inspire anyone, but if I could do, even a  small part for them to gain courage themselves, I think that's good. <br/>Jeff: I think you did that. <br/>Jeff: Ron. Simple question: It's very tough to be a teacher, especially  with your career and your redennials and come on "Survivor," which  is a tough game, and be basically a villain. Was there any kickback at all or did your students embrace it? <br/>Yeah, I talked to my students before the first episode,  and I said, it's a game where you can lie and manipulate. They said, you better lie. You better win that game. I tell them to go for it in life. Dream big. If you're going to do something, do it. I wasn't necessarily trying to be a villain. I was trying the play hard. I appreciated the opportunity. <br/>Jeff: You did. We appreciated you being out there. Julia, for me there were so many moving stories, even honestly  as I was watching the show backstage when you all told your stories at the  end of extinction, but yours really connected because finding that piece with  your dad is something you couldn't have anticipated happening. <br/>Never. <br/>Jeff: And now that you're hope and you've seen it, is there  -- because "Survivor" was kind of full circle. You watched to get over him, and then you played and it helped  you heal him. <br/>Absolutely. That's the beauty and the Edge of Extinction, that's the last  thing I would have ever expected to come of coming on "Survivor."  and fortunately for me my Edge of Extinction experience brought something  that I never would have expected from playing. That was internal peace and, you know, recognizing my own  strengths and bringing that with me in life. While there might only be one sole Survivor this season, there  can be multiple win verse you find value in your experience. I absolutely found the value in my experience. <br/>Jeff: Beautiful. There were so many stories. I wish we had more time. The season was so good. Aubry, you were always awesome when you let us in and let us see  you grow. Lauren, you pushed your body so hard, you pulled a Joe. You actually passed out. <br/>Joe probably looked better doing it. <br/>Jeff: I don't know. You hit pretty hard. Victoria, here's the thing most people said, she's so stealth. We sometimes forget she's in the game. It's impossible to hide on that beach, and even I missed you  sometimes in challenges. And Wardog, you're one of the most unorthodox players, but you  dove so many stories. And also, Aurora, and I know I'm doing the speech, but Aurora, I  want to say that I saw you out there. And I felt like you struggled the entire time to find a bond,  and you told us why. You told us. It's my story. It's who I am. It's why when Lauren falls, I can look for an opportunity to  step over the body, because that's how it is. I want to make sure you know how many people were proved by that  and connected by your story, as well. So thank you for sharing that. All right. We're going to take a break. When we come back, after one great season on edge, we have  another season coming up. We'll show you what we're doing next right after this. <br/>Jeff: "Survivor reunion" will continue only on  cbs. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Kelley, you look skinnier. <br/>Jeff: That was the moment the Edge of Extinction arrived  at ponderosa and saw what they looked like. That series is worth checking out. As this season comes to an end, I'm happy to say, once again,  there is a new one just around the bend. Take a look. For our 39th season, two legendary winners return to the game. <br/>Between the two of us, we've played over 200 days. We've both won the game. Sandra is the only contestant to ever win twice. We know threferg is to know about Survivor. I wrote a book on it. <br/>Jeff: But for the first time ever, they won't be competing  for the $1 million prize. Instead they'll live together on their own island and serve as  mentors to a group of new players. <br/>If they could take what rob can teach them and what I can  teach them and put it all together, they can take home the all they got to do  is listen. <br/>Jeff: It's a "Survivor" bootcamp where every  visit is a dance with danger. <br/>We're not giving you anything for free. <br/>"Survivor" school is in session. <br/>Jeff: Coming this fall, "Survivor" island of the  idols. Surveillance's version of mount rushmore. More reunion coming up. <br/>Jeff: If you want to bid on promise from this season of  "Survivor," go to Survivorprops.Com. Thank you for watching and continuing to be loyal. We'll see you in if fall for "Survivor: Island of the  idols." nice job, everybody. Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org
