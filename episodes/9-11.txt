<br/> <br/>Probst: Previously on Survivor: Survivors, ready? Go! The  tribe competed as two randomly split teams of four. Chris, Chad and Ami  dragged Eliza across the finish line first.  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: The four embarked on a cultural experience of a  lifetime... [men singing] ...and were treated to an array of Vanuatu customs.  [Chad gags, coughs] Back at camp, the others endured a terrible storm.  <br/>It's going to be a miracle if we can keep our fire. I've  never been in a worse situation than this.  <br/>Probst: The next morning, Scout proposed a plan to first  oust Eliza and then Ami. When the others returned from the reward, Ami  suspected something was up.  <br/>I had really weird feelings.  <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, Chad and Twila hung in  the longest. And Chad is slipping.  <br/>Go down, Chad, go down.  <br/>Probst: Twila wins immunity.  <br/>Yes!  <br/>Probst: Back at camp, Ami swayed Leann and Julie to vote  out Chad instead of Eliza...  <br/>Scout?  <br/>Yeah?  <br/>They're not going to vote for Eliza.  <br/>Probst: ...forcing Scout and Twila to make a tough  decision.  <br/>I'm not going to do nothing yet. I'm still thinking. I'm  aggravated.  <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Scout admitted to scheming with  the guys.  <br/>We have talked quite a bit about different strategies to  get to the end of the game.  <br/>It makes me nervous that two women might be voting with  the two men.  <br/>Probst: Although Eliza received two votes, the women's  alliance held strong, and Chad was voted out of the tribe... Chad, the tribe  has spoken. ...leaving Chris as the last man standing. Seven are left. Seven  are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? Who  will be voted out tonight? [theme song playing] [theme song playing] [theme  song playing] ♪ ♪ ♪ [deep rumbling] [deep rumbling]  <br/>I really thought I was going home, though. Tribal Council  sucks. I hate it. I always think I'm going home. It's kind of funny, but  everyone who conspires against me ends up who conspires against me ends up  off and I'm still here. off and I'm still here.  <br/>Yeah. Scout and Twila come to me and Chad wanting to form  an alliance with us. And Scout thought she could get you and Leann to vote  for Eliza. And when Eliza was gone, then Scout, Twila, me and Chad would have  the numbers on you, Ami and Leann, and we'd get rid of Ami first. Swear to  God on my family's lives. As soon as I got back to camp, I narc'd out Scout  and Twila, and I let them know that they had conspired with me and Chad for  an alliance. I just, you know, I just mixed things up as soon as we got back.  It's going to be a mess.  <br/>Oh, boy. This kind of changes everything in my head for  the moment.  <br/>Mm-hmm. It's hard to choose what to believe because it  would do Chris a lot of good to get us mad at Twila and Scout. It would make  him last longer in It would make him last longer in the game. the game.  <br/>I'm actually very surprised that things happened the way  they did last night. So I told Twila about it. I heard some things that I'm  not very comfortable with, and we very comfortable with, and we need to talk  about it. need to talk about it.  <br/>Paranoia sets in on a lot of us. And I think it needs to  quit.  <br/>I have to tell you, Twila, you're striking me as a panic  player right now.  <br/>Why?  <br/>It makes me feel like  <br/>It makes me feel like you're going to jump ship. you're  going to jump ship.  <br/>She just completely confirmed the story, but she told me  it was all Scout's idea. Man, I just didn't think it would happen this soon.  I thought we'd at least wait until the guys were gone before the girls  started going crazy on each other. But, oh, it's happening. If they were  going to go with that plan, they should have stuck with it, 'cause now, stuck  with it, 'cause now, they're screwed. they're screwed.  <br/>Probst: And then there were seven. All right. For today's  challenge, we're going to test how much you recall from the past 28 days. I'm  going to ask you five questions about past challenges. Each time you get an  answer right, you score a point. At the end of five questions, the person  with the most points wins the reward. Want to know what you're playing  for?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Sure do.  <br/>Probst: It's no big secret, after 28 days, the one thing  you miss more than food...  <br/>Oh, no.  <br/>No.  <br/>Probst: Is love.  <br/>Oh, no.  <br/>Probst: So here's what we've set up. We brought in a  satellite. We have a computer hooked up to the Internet. The winner's going  to get a one-hour real-time e-mail back-and-forth chat. You can type  something, they can type back to you. So this is a chance to get caught up  with what's going on back home, give a little love and certainly get a whole  lot of love that you need to make it through the last 11 days. Worth playing  for?  <br/>ALL: Yeah.  <br/>Probst: I want to whet your appetite and give everybody a  one-minute e-mail hello.  <br/>Oh, thank God. Thank you, Jeff.  <br/>Probst: Let's head in the hut.  <br/>Oh, my God! [laughs] Oh, my God...  <br/>Probst: Twila, you're already crying.  <br/>Yep.  <br/>Probst: Well then, let's put you first. Sit on down.  <br/>Can somebody else type for me? I don't know how to  type.  <br/>Probst: You don't?  <br/>No.  <br/>Probst: So you don't use computers much?  <br/>No.  <br/>Probst: No. You get a... aw... It's a darn good thing that  we have a camera so you can hear and see your loved ones.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Probst: Hold on here, let's see if we've got James down  here, your son.  <br/>Hi. Hi, Mom, how are you?  <br/>I was being tough till I seen you.  <br/>Oh, you're still tough. We love you. We miss you a  ton.  <br/>I love you too, buddy. I miss you so much.  <br/>Probst: All right, Twila, you gotta say your  good-byes.  <br/>I gotta say good-bye, buddy. You know I ain't very good at  this dumb stuff, but hope I get to talk to you later.  <br/>Do good for me.  <br/>All right, babe.  <br/>Love you.  <br/>Love you, too.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Bye. [Twila sobbing]  <br/>Probst: All right, Leann, have a seat.  <br/>Oh, boy.  <br/>Probst: Let's see who it is.  <br/>[gasps]: Teri!  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Hi! I love you. I miss you.  <br/>I love you, too. I know; I wish I could give you a big  hug.  <br/>Me, too. Bye, baby.  <br/>I love you. Bye.  <br/>Probst: Eliza, have a seat. Who would you most like to  talk to?  <br/>My mommy. [squeals] Mommy!  <br/>Probst: There she is.  <br/>I love you, baby. You're the best. [kisses] I wish I could  give you a great big hug; and I miss you so much, sweetheart. Be nice to my  Lizie out there, you guys.  <br/>You heard her.  <br/>Probst: Julie.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Probst: Have a seat. Here's Justin.  <br/>Oh, this is my good friend. Holy ... [laughing] What's  up?! Can you believe this?  <br/>What's going on?  <br/>Don't be so relaxed. Dude... dude! [laughing] All right, I  miss you.  <br/>I miss you.  <br/>All right. Take care of yourself.  <br/>I'll see you real soon, all right?  <br/>All right, bye-bye.  <br/>Probst: Scout.  <br/>Oh, Scout.  <br/>Probst: Let's see if we can't get your partner up here.  What's her name?  <br/>Annie.  <br/>Probst: There she is.  <br/>Oh, honey. Hi... hi, honey. I love you so much.  <br/>Oh.  <br/>I've got my arms wrapped you all the time. You know  they're there.  <br/>Oh...  <br/>Probst: Ami, have a seat. There can only be one person you  want to talk to.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Who is it?  <br/>Crissy.  <br/>Probst: Who's Crissy?  <br/>My girlfriend.  <br/>Probst: There she is.  <br/>Hi, baby.  <br/>It's so good to see your face.  <br/>I know, God. It seems like forever. I miss you a  lot.  <br/>I miss you a lot, too.  <br/>No crying.  <br/>No crying. I love you so much, babe. I want to go do the  best I can.  <br/>Yeah, because you get to talk to me, so do well.  <br/>I love you.  <br/>I love you. I'll see you soon.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Probst: That's it.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Probst: Chris. Who do you want to talk to most? Would be  that be your woman? Let's see if we can get her up here.  <br/>Hi.  <br/>How you doing?  <br/>Good; how are you?  <br/>I'm hanging in there.  <br/>Put your hands on the screen.  <br/>I'm right here.  <br/>It's hard being away from you, too, baby.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>I love you.  <br/>Oh, I love you, too. So what kind of plans have you made  for Cancun? They all already know.  <br/>Yes, we're gonna get married. [cheering and  applause]  <br/>Probst: Wait, I missed that.  <br/>They're getting married.  <br/>Congratulations.  <br/>You're beautiful and I'll see you soon. [warm  laughter]  <br/>Probst: All right. Shall we do the challenge?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Let's do it. Take a seat on the bench. Anywhere is  fine. At stake, a one-hour chat with your loved one. Here's how it's going to  work. I'm gonna ask you five questions about previous challenges. At the end  of five questions, the person with the most points wins the reward. Shall we  get started?  <br/>Sure.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: First question: In the seventh immunity challenge,  who broke the most tiles with a slingshot, overall? All right. Reveal. The  correct answer is Rory, and everybody has it right. Everybody's on the board.  Next question: In the "Great Escape" challenge, who was the first  man to begin assembling first man to begin assembling his ladder? his ladder?  Reveal. The correct answer was Chad. Everybody got it right. We're all tied  at two. Next question: In the second immunity challenge, where tribes paired  up to collect puzzle pieces while blindfolded, who sat out? Who did not  participate in that challenge? Everybody reveal. The correct answer was...  Dolly. Scout got it right. Leann got it right. Ami got it right. Julie got it  right. Eliza got it right. Here's where we stand: Eliza, Julie, Leann, Scout,  and Ami at three. Twila and Chris at two. Next question: In the fourth  immunity challenge, there were four different symbols used on the colored  tiles. Each correct symbol you identify Each correct symbol you identify is  worth one point. is worth one point. Everybody reveal. The four symbols were  the volcano, the pig head, the coconut tree or the palm tree, and a skull.  Chris, pig head is right. You have one. Scout, volcano is right, coconut tree  is right, pig is right. Leann has volcano, pig and palm tree. All three are  correct. Ami has volcano, skull, and palm tree. Julie: pig, volcano and  skull. You score three. Eliza has volcano, palm tree and pig. You score  three.  <br/>I hate to see that.  <br/>Probst: Twila: fish, turtle, snail and hog. I'll give you  one for the pig.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Probst: Here's where we stand: Chris and Twila at three.  Everybody else tied at six. Final question: In the first reward challenge,  which survivor reward challenge, which survivor fell into the water the most?  fell into the water the most? Everybody reveal. The correct answer was John  K. Chris got it right. Julie got it right. Eliza got it right and Twila got  it right. Julie and Eliza tied at seven will now go into a tie-breaker for  just those two. Julie and Ami, switch seats. At stake, a visit with your  loved one. In the third reward challenge, the memory game, name the matching  pairs of items gathered by the tribes. The person who gets the most wins.  These are the items you guys gathered in the memory game. Julie has an  absolutely blank look on her face. Eliza writing like crazy. Four, three,  two, one. Reveal. Julie has absolutely nothing written down. Which means if  Eliza has even just one right, she wins. First answer is grapefruit.  "Grapefruit" is right. You win reward.  <br/>Yes!  <br/>Probst: Nice job.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Probst: Eliza, ready to go have a little chat with your  mom?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Probst: Or would you rather your mom came out here and  chatted with you?  <br/>No! Are you kidding!  <br/>Probst: Come on out, Susan. [both shrieking]  <br/>Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I can't believe you're  here! I can't believe this!  <br/>You look so beautiful.  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>You did it!  <br/>Probst: Okay, Susan, here's the twist. It's not a one-hour  chat. It's an overnight chat. Go over and have a seat with Eliza and get to  know everybody. So you probably figured out everybody has been here. We've  created a little studio so you could talk to them. There's a winner and a  bunch of losers, but because I saw how much it meant to you guys in there,  you get one little good-bye. So Twila, here's your son James.  <br/>Oh, my God. My fella!  <br/>Mom!  <br/>I miss you so much, so much, so much, so much.  <br/>Probst: Twila, get a good last hug in.  <br/>I miss you so much.  <br/>I love you.  <br/>I love you.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Probst: James, you can have a spot right here. All right,  Leann, get over here. Let's get Teri out here. Let's get Teri out here. Come  on, Teri. Come on, Teri.  <br/>A couple weeks, okay? I love you.  <br/>You look awesome. I love you, too. Okay, bye.  <br/>Probst: Scout, come on over here. See if we can rustle up  Annie. [Annie shrieking]  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>I missed you so much. Still do. You look great. Have  fun.  <br/>Probst: Julie, let's bring out Justin. [Julie shrieking,  laughing]  <br/>My pants are up. Come here, buddy! I want to eat you  up.  <br/>Probst: All right, Ami. Come on up. See if Crissy is back  there. Come on out, Crissy.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Hi, baby. It's so good to hug you again.  <br/>How about you and I go over there?  <br/>Probst: Chris, come on out here. here. Come on, Laurie.  Come on, Laurie.  <br/>Okay. Love you, too.  <br/>Probst: All right, everybody. I hate to break this party  up. Your boat has arrived. You're heading back to the States. Say  good-bye.  <br/>Okay, babe. Okay. Bye.  <br/>Probst: All right. With that, you are going to get to camp  for the night. They'll take you back and show you what life on Survivoris  like. All right, guys, get your stuff, head back to camp. head back to camp.  Have a good night. Have a good night.  <br/>I want to hear about the outside world.  <br/>Me, too.  <br/>I'm so glad you're here. I'm so glad. Oh, I couldn't be  more excited to be able to share this experience with my mom. I want to share  everything with my mom. My mom is my best friend in the entire world and I  could not be more excited that she's here with us. Oh, Mom, we have leftover  trail mix. It's just fried coconuts and plantains.  <br/>Really?  <br/>If you want to try.  <br/>Is it safe for me to get it?  <br/>Oh, yeah.  <br/>Oh, yeah.  <br/>I don't double dip, even if I'm here.  <br/>Mom, you don't have a choice here.  <br/>Does she look different to you? Does she look  thinner?  <br/>She looks thinner. I know on the, on the computer screen,  her face looks, you know... bony. I-I was really worried about Eliza just  being out here. I was worried about bug bites. I was worried about parasites.  I was worried that she wouldn't be flossing every day. I was worried about  Ebola virus. I was worried about all these things in the sea, the-the-the  coral and the things that can cut you and the fish that can bite you, and...  I was worried. I don't know how good my letter was.  <br/>Your letter was great. It was fine. There's definitely a  possibility that people are very resentful that I won that challenge and they  didn't. It could definitely work to my disadvantage, but hopefully, if she bonds  with them, that could help me. It was supposed to be me or Leann gone on day  six. The first time the women lost, it was either Eliza or Leann, and it was  all-- You want to know why it was? What their reasoning was? I talked too  much. I talked too much.  <br/>You're too annoying.  <br/>You're too annoying.  <br/>Answer me this. This morning I asked Twila, I said, did  you, Scout, Chad and Chris have a plan to vote off Eliza and then Ami next,  and she said, "That was Scout's idea."  <br/>Yeah, it was Chad's.  <br/>That's what she told me.  <br/>She said it was your plan. She said it was Scout's  idea.  <br/>And I was like, "What?"  <br/>When I came out here, I was determined to play the game  with integrity and honesty and truth, and if they that didn't work, then I'd  lie, cheat and steal. We've now reduced ourselves to the lie, cheat and steal  part. It was Chad's idea, and that is the God's honest truth. Didn't we have  an agreement when we came over here, no matter what anybody says, we're gonna  stick together.  <br/>I said we'd stick together when we came over, but I never  made any promises about Final Four with you, Scout.  <br/>Well, I thought you had. I thought that the three of us  plus Twila, that we would, that we would go to the...  <br/>We didn't ever say anything about the Final Four.  <br/>So I did a little damage control there. But Leann and Ami  have backed out of their alliance with me, that we would go all the way to  the end of the game together. Call it Final Four, call it whatever you want  to, we would go to the end of the game together and include Twila.  <br/>Have you promised Jules?  <br/>I have since promised Jules.  <br/>Okay. So you want Jules to go to the Final Four? to go to  the Final Four?  <br/>I do.  <br/>I do.  <br/>[snarling] My hackles came up, and they're still up. You  know, whatever happens, you know, "Vengeance is mine," know,  "Vengeance is mine," sayeth the jury. sayeth the jury.  <br/>That's cute. She'll love it.  <br/>Eliza's mom will probably be leaving soon, and everybody's  doing a little something that maybe she can pass on to our loved ones.  <br/>This is for Laurie.  <br/>Something for them to remember us by and let them know  we're thinking about them.  <br/>This has been so great, Mom. This has just been so  great.  <br/>There's the boat.  <br/>There's the boat.  <br/>But Mama....  <br/>But Mama.... I love you so much.  <br/>I love you so much, too.  <br/>Having my mom here has definitely motivated me and made me  know that I can get through this and I'm almost there, and it's just so  wonderful that she got to spend this time with me.  <br/>Take this, too. Keep warm.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>You're a good mom.  <br/>The shirt off my back.  <br/>She took the shirt off her back and gave it to me because  I don't have anything with sleeves even.  <br/>She came out and stripped to her panties and left in only  her bra. She is our kind of woman. She is our kind of woman.  <br/>ALL: Bye!  <br/>ALL: Bye!  <br/>There's one big one right there.  <br/>Ami, Twila and I went to get manioc. And, you know, I  wanted to hear what Twila had to say about this whole Chad and Chris  scam.  <br/>I could tell you all kinds of things people's approached  me with, Leann; all kinds of things. It doesn't matter. My heart has stayed  true to you and Ami.  <br/>But you know what? Any time that any guy comes to me or  talks to me, I tell y'all. Any time that there's anything said... just, just  listen. Don't get defensive. Just understand how that kinda doesn't really  look so good.  <br/>They were trying to work me like crazy.  <br/>Why don't you just shut 'em down?  <br/>Why don't you say, "Absolutely not. There's no way in  hell. Go run on back to your little buddies and..."?  <br/>Why do you have to appease them?  <br/>Why do you even listen to two words? "I have nothing  to hear. Nothing... Bye... See ya." I just think Twila got really  twisted up in her idea of what making peace is and what the right and wrong  thing to do is when it comes to a team.  <br/>I feel like a little bit of a fool because I do have some  mistrust for you now. But, um, I give you my word.  <br/>And I give you mine. On my son, I swear, and you all know  how much I love that boy. I swear to you.  <br/>Do you feel good about that decision? Because you don't  seem like you feel very good about that.  <br/>I-I feel guarded.  <br/>Don't. Don't feel guarded. I swore to Ami and Leann on my  son's name that I was with them 100%. But maybe if I won a million dollars,  God would forgive me. I don't know. I don't know. I hope. I hope.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Julie's pretty much been my informant. She informed me  that their flower power again; girls strong. Julie let me know that my head  is on the chopping block and I have to win immunity to stay in the  game.  <br/>"To save your own skin, you'll need more than just  will, brains and brawn, determination and skill. Yes, it's a race, so you  must hurry, Only one will be safe and one more joins the jury."  <br/>The race is on.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I'm going to win immunity, guaranteed. That's the  prediction. I'll make it right now. Daugherty's going to win immunity.  immunity. It's a fact. It's a fact.  <br/>Probst: First things first. Take back immunity, Twila.  Immunity back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you are going to run it in  pairs. Let's bring in the people you're going to pair up with. Come on  in.  <br/>Oh, my God. [cheering]  <br/>Probst: I think you know these guys-- your loved ones.  They're still here. They're gonna run it with you. [cheering]  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Probst: All right. Your loved ones are down to a  one-in-seven shot at a million bucks. The only way to guarantee they get to a  one-in-six shot is to have this around their neck. That's where you're going  to either help them or potentially hurt them. Here's how it's going to work:  Each pair will be designated a color. The loved ones will be blindfolded. The  survivors will verbally direct their loved ones to retrieve three bags of  puzzle pieces. Once you have all three bags, take off your blindfold, start  putting the puzzle together. The first pair to finish their puzzle wins  immunity for their survivor. We will randomly draw for position. position.  We'll get started. We'll get started. This is going to be fun.  <br/>Ow!  <br/>Probst: For immunity. Survivors ready? Go.  <br/>Laurie, spread your feet and walk, walk, walk!  <br/>Left, Annie, left.  <br/>To your right, to your right!  <br/>Left, left.  <br/>To your right, to your right, Laurie!

That one, yes!  That's it.  <br/>Drop the bag! Drop the bag!  <br/>Probst: James drops his first bag. He's back on the  course.  <br/>No, no, no! Turn around! Listen to me!  <br/>Probst: Susan getting closer to her daughter, further away  from her bags.  <br/>Stop! Drop it! Turn around.  <br/>Probst: Laurie has her first bag. She's heading out for  her second.  <br/>To your right. Go to your right. Jimmy, to your other  right.  <br/>Come on! Straight, straight! Drop it.  <br/>Probst: Annie back with her first bag for Scout. She's  back on the course.  <br/>I said straight! Faster, faster! Straight! No!  <br/>Good job. You're coming straight to my voice, baby. I love  you. Drop the bag.  <br/>Probst: Crissy back with a second bag for Ami.  <br/>Go around the pole! Come on, Laurie! Walk faster! Let's  go, Laurie! Come on, Laurie! Keep coming! Keep coming, Laurie! Keep coming!  Nothing in front of you! Drop it! Turn around!  <br/>Probst: Laurie back with her second bag.  <br/>Hurry, Teri!  <br/>What?  <br/>Good girl, yes. Just hop over it.  <br/>There, there! Left! Laurie, to your left! Right there!  Right there!  <br/>Turn to your right. Turn... now drop the bag. Drop  it.  <br/>Probst: Take off your blindfold, Crissy. Ami and Crissy  can start working on the puzzle.  <br/>Stop, Annie! Back up, back up! No, no! Yes!  <br/>Drop it! Drop it!  <br/>Probst: Take off your blindfold, Laurie. Start putting the  puzzle together.  <br/>Come on, baby.  <br/>I think this goes down here.  <br/>Yeah, they got blue on top.  <br/>Probst: It's going to be a race between the puzzle-makers  now. Chris and Laurie versus Ami and Crissy.  <br/>To your right. Drop it. Take off your blindfold.  <br/>Probst: Scout and Annie are now in it.  <br/>Hurry! Take off the...  <br/>Come on, come on! Take it off, take it off!  <br/>Probst: Take off your blindfold. Justin and Julie are now  in this.  <br/>Can you hear me, Teri?  <br/>No.  <br/>Then why don't you just sit down and stop?  <br/>Right to my voice, right to my voice. Come on, come on,  son. Right there. Take your blindfold off.  <br/>Probst: James is back with his third bag. Twila and James  now working on the puzzle.  <br/>We need something to build on.  <br/>Probst: Ami and Crissy having trouble with the puzzle.  Chris working furiously to make up time.  <br/>Faster! Yeah, there you are.  <br/>Oh, good.  <br/>Probst: Ami and Crissy getting very close. Chris and  Laurie still fighting. Immunity at stake. Somebody going home tonight.  <br/>Right here, right here.  <br/>Huh?  <br/>Probst: And they have it!  <br/>Probst: And they have it! Ami wins immunity! Ami wins  immunity!  <br/>Probst: All right, guys, fall in right here in front of  the towers. Ami, come on over. Turn around. Let's put this on. Nicely done.  Good communication with your partner. As a result, you are safe. Tonight's  Tribal Council. For the loved ones, one of your survivors, this game is about  to end. Tonight at Tribal Council, somebody's going to be voted out. out. Say  your good-byes. Say your good-byes.  <br/>Probst: All right, loved ones, head back the same way you  came. You got to go.  <br/>Bye, everyone.  <br/>Bye, Annie.  <br/>Bye, Annie.  <br/>Bye, Annie.  <br/>Bye, Annie.  <br/>Probst: Sort of a strange cacophony of emotion there.  Tribal Council tonight. Somebody else going home. You have the afternoon to  figure out who it's going to be. out who it's going to be. I'll see you at  Tribal Council. I'll see you at Tribal Council.  <br/>So Ami won the immunity challenge, and that freed us up to  vote for who we were going to vote for next, which was Chris. For some  reason, it didn't feel right that Chris was going to go home and Eliza  wasn't.  <br/>I'll go with you.  <br/>I'm going to head down toward that big one.  <br/>So we went for a little walk in the woods. And we decided  as a group, "Let's talk really, like, who deserves to stay."  <br/>Something just doesn't sit right with me, the fact that  for some reason, it doesn't sit completely right with me.  <br/>If you had to make a make a decision right now...?  <br/>It don't matter to me. I mean, you all know how I  feel.  <br/>I just feel like we've come this far on principle.  <br/>Of having all women together?  <br/>Yes, but yet, we did vote Lisa off.  <br/>We've been talking about Eliza getting off every damn  time.  <br/>Every time.  <br/>I think Chris should go next, but it's not setting really  well for Leann, so if she decides that it's not right, then I'm going to  stick with what she says.  <br/>All right, we've made our decision.  <br/>GROUP: All right.  <br/>We just really hope it doesn't mess us up in the long run  and he wins immunity the next couple of times. next couple of times. That  would be really bad. That would be really bad.  <br/>So, I mean, it's 100% but if it does change, I'll tell  you, but I don't think, I swear...  <br/>How, how, how is that going to swing, me not going  home?  <br/>Because, I mean, everyone just thinks you deserve it more.  Are you surprised?  <br/>I'm happy. I mean, I'm pumped. It's like being in a  tornado. It is crazy. I don't even have to do something to change the tide of  the game. There's six women living with me-- they'll change it themselves. It  can be set in stone who's going home, and five minutes later, I'm not going  home and I ain't done a damn thing to change it. I'm just sitting there by  the fire. So I make my way out to get some wood and Twila says to me while  we're filling this crate, "You know, you can change this game  completely." So I'm thinking, "I'm all ears, Twila."  Twila."  <br/>Think about it.  <br/>Think about it.  <br/>Think about it.  <br/>Think about it.  <br/>You are so right.  <br/>You are so right.  <br/>If you would just get Eliza, say, "If you want to  change this whole outlook, vote this way, you've got three other people  backing you up."  <br/>Guaranteed? Scout's a guarantee?  <br/>Guaranteed. I swore on my son's name. May God forgive me  for saying that, because it's not the right thing to do, but it's time for  something to change. Ami and Leann just act like they're so much better than  everybody else and they've got this all wrapped up in their back pocket, and,  and it just back pocket, and, and it just freaking pisses me off. freaking  pisses me off.  <br/>'Cause right now, I'm still in...  <br/>I'm not going to. You have my word. You have my word. I'm  not going to, Twila. I'm not going to, Twila.  <br/>I'll get this. Am I willing to do it? Damn right I'm  willing to do it. I'll turn the tide, I'll take the risk right now. So I  talked to Eliza. Here's the bottom line: Julie told me, "You're staying,  you're not going home tonight. We're voting for Eliza." That's the exact  words I was told, okay? Listen, Eliza. You don't have to go home tonight.  All's you got to do is one thing.  <br/>Okay, what do I have to do?  <br/>This is how you can stay.  <br/>Chris pulls me aside and says, "Twila and Scout  discussed with him the possibility of changing this game around, and the only  way to do it would be with my vote.  <br/>You have my word, I swear to you.  <br/>But I don't trust Scout and Twila, that's what scares  me.  <br/>You do not have to worry about Scout and Twila. I swear, I  have talked...  <br/>I think this is a big plot and I'm gonna go home.  <br/>I don't know how to reassure you. I am just telling you  the truth. I've never lied to you. I'm not using you.  <br/>But the thing that worries me is that Scout and Twila are  lying to both of us. Twila are lying to both of us.  <br/>Just please take this risk.  <br/>Just please take this risk.  <br/>Probst: Now bring in the jury. Sarge and Chad, voted out  at the last Tribal Council. Okay. The last three days have had a lot of  emotion. Eliza, did having your mom here wake you up to how close you are to  winning this thing?  <br/>Um, yes, having gotten to the point of the family visit in  this game made me realize how far along we really are, because we have talked  about this on day seven maybe, and it was, it was a long-term goal for all of  us.  <br/>Probst: Chris, what was it like to be in an immunity  challenge where, clearly, you, of all people, have definitely felt on your  heels for a while. Now you have your fiancée, who can help you or hurt you in  this game, depending on how well you do?  <br/>I knew that, uh, she was wanting to give it 110%. It meant  a lot to her to come through and, you know, get me immunity. Um, we worked  hard together and she gave it 110%. I love her to death. She did a great job  today.  <br/>Probst: Now, at the other end of the spectrum, Leann, you  seemed just so happy to have Teri there that you were taking more of the  moment of a friendship thing, "Look what we're doing together, and if I  don't win immunity, I don't win immunity."  <br/>Well, I really wanted to win. I mean, I set out to win,  but, you know, you get halfway through and you realize there's not a chance  in hell you're going to win it. Then I just thought it was funny. Why not  laugh with it? I'm not going to have her feel bad about it. That would be  horrible.  <br/>Probst: Well, it seems to me that Chris, out of everybody  here, was connecting with Laurie in a way like nobody else was, which is  regardless of what's happening, I got to win this thing.  <br/>I didn't tell her it was life or death for me. I didn't  feel like it was.  <br/>Probst: Eliza, once again, you brought your bag.  <br/>Jeff...  <br/>Probst: You're becoming the girl who cried wolf.  <br/>But you know what? It's, like, "Oh, Eliza was just  being paranoid, Eliza's just being paranoid." And then every time I get  back to camp and I find out, "Oh, my God, I was this close to being  voted off." It is not paranoia. It is valid 100%. And I very well might  be going home tonight. No joke.  <br/>Probst: I don't think it is a joke. I just know you've  said it at every single Tribal Council.  <br/>And at every Tribal Council, I have almost been voted off.  Honestly.  <br/>Probst: Chris, as the outsider, is there any tension with  this tribe, because what you guys show me is very happy-go-lucky and  everybody's having a good time.  <br/>Um, it's me and six women-- six women. There's tension  between six women. I don't care what anybody says. I can see and feel the  tension, and whether it be them playing the game and strategizing or figuring  out, you know, who they want to go home next, there's always that feeling  that, you know, something's going on that not all of them are always  agreeing.  <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. Ami, you have  immunity. As always, you can keep it or assign it to somebody else.  <br/>I'm going to keep it.  <br/>Probst: You cannot vote for Ami; everybody else is fair  game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Leann, you're up. Leann, you're  up.  <br/>My vote's for Eliza. Um, group consensus. Everybody  agreed, but you are Everybody agreed, but you are like a little sister. like  a little sister.  <br/>Sorry, Eliza. I had to stick with the team, and I guess  it's your time to and I guess it's your time to go. go.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes.  <br/>Probst: Once votes are read, the decision is final. The  person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.  I'll read the votes. First vote... Eliza. Leann. One vote Eliza, one vote  Leann. Eliza. Two votes Eliza, one vote Leann. Eliza. Three votes Eliza, one  vote Leann. Leann. Three votes Eliza, two votes Leann. Leann. We're tied.  Three votes Leann, three votes Eliza. I'll read the last vote. 12th person  voted out of Survivor: Vanuatu: Leann. Leann. Bring me your torch. Bring me your  torch. Leann, the tribe has spoken. Leann, the tribe has spoken. It's time  for you to go. It's time for you to go. Well, as the last vote was read,  there were some very smug looks; other faces were absolutely shocked. Nine  days left, this game has just been turned on its head. Grab your torches.  Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night.

I'm still in the game.  <br/>We have been waiting for an opportunity to turn this  game.  <br/>The bitterness started as soon as we got back to camp.  It's going to be good.  <br/>Probst: And the surprises just keep coming. just keep  coming.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>I am just floored. I just got done saying how it wasn't a  life-or-death situation for me at today's challenge. I was fooled. I was  fooled big-time. I'd love to know who voted for me 'cause I am just freakin'  flabbergasted at how someone could just lie directly to your face. I feel like  the world's biggest I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
