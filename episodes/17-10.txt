<br/> Jeff Probst: Tonight on a special episode of Survivor: Gabon,you'll get a  fresh look at the survivors with never-before-seen footage. <br/>If you get me, you're-you're not offended by me. If you don't get me, you go crying home to Mama. <br/>Oh, my God! [laughter]  Oh! <br/>I want to kill Sugar. I hate her. <br/>I'm Sugar. <br/>Probst: For the first time...  I'm a professional gamer. <br/>Probst: ...watch the audition tapes that turned the applicants into survivors. <br/>I need a little pain. I need a little suffering. <br/>Probst: And follow the unlikely stories of how the early underdogs came out  on top. Kenny...  It comes down to brains versus brawn and I'm a huge-time strategist. <br/>Probst: Crystal...  The game is outwit, outlast. You can't outwit Crystal Cox, baby. <br/>Probst: Bob...  My strategy is to be needed. That's going to get me further on in the game. <br/>Probst: Sugar...  I'm not too bad at this. [laughs] I'm a lot better than I thought for sure. <br/>Probst: Susie...  It's about knowing when to react. I mean, I really feel confident I know when to jump. <br/>Probst: Matty...  This is by far the hardest thing I've ever done. My whole driving force out here is Jamie; she's my girlfriend. <br/>Probst: And Corinne...  I'm here 'cause I want to win. I believe that I'll be in the I believe that I'll be in the top three. top three. <br/>Probst: From the very first moments of the game, the Fang tribe set  themselves up for failure with some odd choices during the schoolyard pick. <br/>Susie, come on home! <br/>I knew it. <br/>I'm going to pick the big homey with all the game right there. <br/>Probst: It was immediately clear that Fang was physically weaker than Kota  and this would prove to be their demise... as Fang lost ten out of the next  14 challenges. Kota wins immunity! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Kota wins immunity! Kota scores! Kota! Kota! Kota wins immunity and reward! This is not even close. <br/>I'm starting to lose my spirit. I'm starting to lose my hope. We don't match up to Kota physically. We don't match up to Kota mentally. We don't match up to Kota. <br/>Probst: The Fang tribe bickered. <br/>Eat your rice. [mumbling]  Randy, are you, like, the leader of the tribe now? <br/>Drop it. <br/>I don't have to drop nothing, man. I can ask you something if I want. <br/>And I can just ignore you then. <br/>Probst: Michelle, the tribe has spoken. And their tribe quickly dwindled. Gillian. <br/>Bummer. <br/>Probst: Kota lost one member early on. Paloma, the tribe has spoken. But they remained rational and united. <br/>All right, Marcus! [cheering]  Our morale was super high. We love our team. <br/>Probst: Marcus artfully kept things together...  And away we go. <br/>Probst: ...and made a solid early alliance with Charlie, Corinne, and Jacquie. These four looked poised to go all the way to the end. But it's not always the obvious front-runner that comes out on top. Marcus drops a pole. He's out of the challenge. And amazingly... The tribe has spoken. ...out of this early powerhouse alliance, only Corinne made it to the final  seven. What are you about to see is the story of a quiet group of underdogs who  slowly finessed underdogs who slowly finessed their games and ended up on top. their games and ended up on top. [theme song playing] Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT CBS PARAMOUNT  NETWORK TELEVISION NETWORK TELEVISION NETWORK TELEVISION     Coming up: we'll get a never-before-seen glimpse  at the survivors' audition tapes. <br/>There's an expression: "That guy's really out on a limb," and, uh...  oh... and, uh... oh... [growling] [growling]  Education is incumbent upon me, but work is something that has always  distinguished me. <br/>Probst: Four months ago, 18 people were chosen to be the survivors of Gabon. <br/>I am 22 years old. <br/>I'm going to bring some entertainment. <br/>I've only loved one person in my life, and that was my dog. He's in this urn right here. Dogs rule. People suck. Uh... [phone ringing] I hate [bleep] phones. <br/>Probst: Out of those 18, only seven remain. Here's what they said to get here. <br/>And I joined a sorority. <br/>Good morning, my name is Mr. Crowley. I am a mild-mannered physics teacher here in Gorham High School. There's an expression: "That guy is really out on a limb," and, uh...  oh... and, uh... oh... [growling] [growling] In order to win Survivor,one of  the things you have to do is be able to do is eat all that weird stuff, that  real crap. And I'd like to just thank these girls here at the cafeteria at Gorham High  School, 'cause over 20 years they've been serving me real crap, and I think I...  [laughter]  Hi, my name is Crystal Cox. You've probably seen me before, yes, me, Crystal, the 2004 Olympic gold  medalist. It's time for me to tackle some new challenges in my life. Why I think I should be it? Because I have the three "B"s: brains, beauty, and blazing speed. <br/>I am 47 years old. Grew up pretty poor. Still am pretty poor. I've always exuded confidence. I'm-I'm always fun to be around. Anyway, please call me. Um, I do want to bring my tweezers because I don't want to have a hairy  mustache and a beard when I come home. That would not be cool. Okay, got to go. So, please call me, Mr. Burnett. I really am ready. <br/>I'm from Orange County, California, and I think I have what it takes to be on  the next Survivor. I'm a professional gamer. Here's some of my checks over here that I've won doing some of my tournaments. What separates me from the losers are my mind games. I can out-predict everyone so well that I'm always one step ahead of them. <br/>Hey, I'm Corinne. And I'm a graduate of the University of Florida where I went on full academic  scholarship, graduated in three years, and with highest honors. I've got two tactics. One: flirtation. The second tactic is manipulation. Oh, and one more thing... I'm a risk taker. I always jump into the deep end of the pool. <br/>I'm 29 and I'm Sugar. I'm jobless and homeless right now. Um, my dad passed away five and a half months ago, and I need to grow up a  lot more than I am right now. So, it would be, like, the best thing that-that I could do for myself. I would like to eat some snails and raw fish and bugs and whatever it takes  and... Come on in. <br/>All righty. <br/>Hey, so, I got some company. Thanks for watching. <br/>My name is Matty Whitmore. I was put on this planet for the sole purpose of being on this show. Matty, Dink, and Jamie. I love my girl and my boy. My hard-core physical training. My hard-core philosophy. It takes focus and discipline because living a dream here in paradise only  gets you so far. I need a little pain. I need a little suffering. I need a little suffering. <br/>Probst: 30 days ago, 18 Americans journeyed to a remote section of Africa for  the adventure of a lifetime. Welcome to Survivor: Gabon, Earth's Last Eden. You guys ready to get started? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: In the very first challenge, Kota beat Fang by a landslide. Kota wins the extra food! I have corn and beans. I have corn and beans. Kota was upbeat and happy. Kota was upbeat and happy. <br/>Rice pudding? <br/>Rice pudding? <br/>Our team rocks! <br/>Probst: But the Fang tribe was starving. <br/>So I don't necessarily think that that's healthy. <br/>It's-it's okay. Don't even think about it. Close your eyes. Don't even think about it. There's a fruit that we found in the woods that we call Gabon pears. pears. It's rather nasty. It's rather nasty. <br/>It's not bad. Not bad at all. <br/>Little grasshoppers I'm going to have to call breakfast this morning, unless  y'all want some. <br/>They're all deceased? <br/>They're all deceased? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Gulping down that grasshopper was gross. It was by far one of the grotesques thing I have ever done. He's stuck in my throat. [laughter]  Probst: Anything at Fang that  Probst: Anything at Fang that could go wrong did go wrong. could go wrong did go wrong. <br/>Yeah, it's just a leech. <br/>How does the leech look? I want to see it. <br/>No, it's done bleeding. It used to be bleeding, bro. It's nothing. <br/>Oh, it isn't nothing. A leech got in the water, you mean? <br/>Yes. <br/>Well, it's a good thing you jumped in and tested it out for us. <br/>Everybody else is scared of the water now, I think, except for Matty because  of the deadly leeches that swim out there. <br/>You're not worried about leeches at all, huh? <br/>No. Randy got attacked by leeches and even though I'm swimming around in that  water, frolicking around that water, I haven't seen one leech on me and of  course they grab on to Randy and suck him dry of all his blood. [laughs] It was pretty funny. <br/>Probst: But when he got back to camp, Matty discovered he picked up a new  friend along the way. <br/>Oh, my...  What? <br/>I have a leech on my...  Oh, you got it on the back of your ankle. <br/>The other side. <br/>It was on my freaking cut. [laughter]  That freaked you out. <br/>I got it off, though. <br/>You better pull your pants down. They love your butt, too. Check that real good. <br/>That's disgusting. <br/>Look how fat it is. It grew. What a scumbag. Look at all that blood he ate. <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Let me see. Let me see. <br/>All my blood...  Oh! <br/>Probst: At Kota, Marcus, Corinne, Charlie, and Jacquie were running the show,  and they had Bob in their back pocket. <br/>I have Jacquie, Marcus, Charlie, you know. We're all in your boat. As long as, you know, you feel the same way we do, we're all in it together. Here's the deal: these are the four; you're the fifth. That's all you need to know. It's the majority; that's it. So lock it down. That's it. <br/>That's a good point. <br/>Probst: And when Kota won yet another challenge... Kota wins immunity and  reward! ...they sent Dan from Fang to be the first to visit Exile Island. But this time, Exile Island was different. Dan had a choice between getting a clue to the hidden immunity idol or  spending the time there in idle comfort. Dan chose the clue, but his search for the idol came up empty. <br/>I'm tired. I'm thirsty, hungry, and I cannot find this immunity idol. <br/>Probst: At Kota, there was  Probst: At Kota, there was love in the air. love in the air. <br/>So Marcus and Jacquie always go off together and have become the couple of  our tribe, which is a problem. Because any time you are in a romantic involvement with somebody else, it  puts a target on your back. Honestly, every time you go off with Jacquie, everyone makes comments. <br/>Do they? Dude, is that why...? <br/>Yes. Yesterday, you guys were standing at the end of the dock. They were like, "Do you think they would agree to just get married at  the end of the dock right there?" Yeah, you got some problems. You need to watch yourself. I have no intention of staying with them if they continue this behavior. It's just not... It's bad business. [hoots]  Probst: When Fang finally won a reward challenge... Fang wins reward! [cheering] ...they sent Sugar to Exile Island. <br/>I knew that. <br/>Probst: How did you know that? <br/>I knew that they were going to pick me because they think I'm dumb. <br/>Probst: Some of Sugar's tribe mates had little faith she would survive on  Exile. <br/>She's not going to be able to find it. She just... She's a pinup. Her name's Sugar. I think Sugar on Exile Island is doing about as bad as anybody can be doing  on Exile. She is so, like, clutching her knees, rocking back and forth, hysterically  crying. She has an attempted hope for the idol. She's probably this close from a complete meltdown. If not already in the throes of a meltdown. <br/>Probst: But Corinne underestimated the will of the pinup model. <br/>[gasps] Oh, my God, I found it! <br/>Probst: And just like that, Sugar had become the most powerful player in the  game. <br/>When Fang sent me to Exile, I thought maybe they thought I was dumb and that  I'd never find the idol, no way. I can't believe I found it and the lawyer didn't. How funny is that? That's funny. <br/>Probst: Coming up in a new scene: an adventure for Kota is no picnic for  Corinne. <br/>I'd rather be serving up poison to these people. poison to these people. I hate these people. I hate these people. [bird squawks, rhino snorts]  Probst: When Sugar returned from Exile, she let Ace, her from Exile, she let  Ace, her closest ally, in on her secret. closest ally, in on her secret. <br/>I just had a very nice conversation in the canoe, being told that Sugar has  the immunity idol, and we're going to, hopefully, dominate this game. hopefully, dominate this game. [trumpeting] [trumpeting]  Probst: Over at Fang, they were running out of rice. <br/>Seen the rice? We're over halfway done. I will... I will make my speech, and then I'm going to shut up, and you guys  can decide, but we need to be eating one meal a day. Period. We're all going to be hungry. That's why it's called Survivor. <br/>Probst: With tension still in the air, good-natured Matty tried to lighten  things up with a heartfelt song honoring his girlfriend. <br/>Get in a circle around the fire, okay? Do you guys want to sing, uh, "Jamie's a Jolly Good Woman?"  Okay. <br/>I missed her birthday. I can't... I got to do something. <br/>You got to sing to her, man. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Is that cool? <br/>I like Matty. He just is a cool kid. He's a... Reminds me a lot of my little brother, but sometimes I think Matty  seems a little insecure. <br/>Ready, one, two, three. <br/>Jamie's a jolly good woman  Jamie's a jolly good woman   Jamie's a jolly good woman That nobody can deny. <br/>We love you, Jamie! <br/>We love you, Jamie! <br/>Being out here, it's even solidified more that I love my girlfriend, and  that's what I'm girlfriend, and that's what I'm doing this for. doing this for. <br/>But I'm realizing that, overall, dude, I'm anxiety-ridden. I got to really address that issue when I get home. <br/>Have you had, uh... Have you had much tragedy in Have you had much tragedy in  your life? your life? Uh, I mean, everything. You know, one-one tops the other. My dog, Johnson, uh, meant more to me than any of these people will. He's been dead five years, and I miss him to this day. And as soon as I get back home, I'm going to get a new one and tell him all  about being here. [sniffles] You know, the dog was five years ago, and, uh, you know, all I've  done is deal with it. I'm not the nicest guy in the world. I've had a tough 49 years, but, uh, Matty knows, if you get me, you're not  offended by me. If you don't get me, you go If you don't get me, you go crying home to Mama. crying home to Mama. [yawning]  Probst: Fang finally started thinking about alliances when Matty, Randy,  Susie, and Dan vowed to stick together. <br/>We are all totally on the same page with this? We don't need to talk about this anymore. <br/>No. <br/>Just put it in. <br/>We don't. <br/>All that matters is the four of us. <br/>Probst: But at the reward challenge, all bets were off when an unexpected  announcement was made. We are picking new tribes. <br/>What?! <br/>No! <br/>No. No, no, no, no! <br/>Oh, wow! <br/>Probst: Drop your buffs. <br/>No! <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Damn it! <br/>I had it all perfect. Dan, Randy, and Susie and I solidified our foursome, and I was super content  with it. I was happy. I was comfortable with that foursome. And then Jeff's, like, "We're going to switch teams." And I was  just, like, "Oh, no!" That was just such a buzz-kill. I didn't even want to hear that. <br/>Probst: Given the opportunity for Fang to build a stronger tribe in another  schoolyard pick, they blew it again with some odd choices. <br/>I'm gonna go with Kelly. I want to get to know her. <br/>Probst: That may be the most surprising decision in ten days out here. <br/>Of course, the mat gets fully pulled out from under me, you know? It's like the Bad News Bears again. We're the goof troop. <br/>Probst: The new red tribe was Matty, Kenny, Crystal, Kelly, Jacquie, and Ace. And the new yellow tribe was Corinne, Bob, Susie, Randy, Dan, Marcus and  Charlie, leaving Sugar left standing. <br/>What does that mean? <br/>Probst: You will go to Exile Island. <br/>[groaning]: Oh, no! [laughter]  Probst: You will then join the tribe that goes to Tribal Council and loses a  member. Since Sugar already had the hidden immunity idol, this time she decided to  settle into the shack. <br/>Comfort time! Oh, my God, this is so good. Oh, my God, this is so good. [laughs] [laughs]  Probst: At the new Kota tribe, Randy was trying hard to keep his aggressive  personality at bay in an effort to secure a long-lasting position in his new  tribe. <br/>I bet you that you're gonna have to be farther away, though. <br/>Susie's doing a great job around camp, and if Randy has a poor performance on  a challenge, and he's not really doing that much around camp, shoot, I'd much  around camp, shoot, I'd rather keep Susie around. rather keep Susie around. [laughter]  Randy. <br/>Probst: And at the immunity challenge, Randy proved he was a force to be  reckoned with... [grunts]  Yeah! <br/>Probst: ...and helped his new tribe continue their winning streak. Kota wins immunity! <br/>Yes! Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Go, Kota! <br/>Probst: Back at Fang, Crystal, Kenny, and Matty had to decide which  newly-inherited member of Kota would go next and why. <br/>I say Kelly. I think Kelly's the weakest link. We were going to vote off Sue next. What's the difference in Sue and Kelly? Not a damn thing. <br/>The difference is, uh, Sugar may have the immunity idol. Ace, Sugar, and Jacquie: those three right now is real deadly. <br/>Darn it. <br/>You cool? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: That night at Tribal Council, Crystal's influence over the tribe  prevailed, and an original frontrunner of Kota was voted out. was voted out. Jacquie, the tribe has spoken. Jacquie, the tribe has spoken. When Sugar returned to her new home, the Fang tribe, she was disappointed that  Jacquie wasn't there. <br/>Welcome back. <br/>Yeah. So, that means Jacquie's gone. <br/>Yup. <br/>Yup. <br/>Yup. <br/>That sucks. <br/>That sucks. [roaring]  Probst: The next day, Corinne was just as shocked to learn that one of her  closest allies had been voted out. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: A lot of reactions on Kota. Surprised? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Definitely. <br/>Probst: From the very first days of his adventure, Bob's fatherly ways and  ingenious craftsmanship were his way to keep him in the game. <br/>It's actually turning out to be a nice-looking bench. <br/>This is the coolest stuff. <br/>You'rethe coolest, Bob. <br/>This is a slingshot we're supposed to kill birds with, but it also acts as a,  uh, Hawaiian sling. <br/>And how many birds have you gotten? <br/>Uh, none. We're in the middle of the jungle, and this is my forte, and they all know it. I made that tripod to put the pot on so we could cook with it, and I made the  spoon, made the spear thing. <br/>Marcus, don't you think we... that would have been nice for a fish? <br/>Yeah, but it's bottom-heavy. <br/>I am valuable to them, and I've grown to like them, and they've grown to like  me. <br/>Is that the sun dial? <br/>Yeah. It sort of...  Show me how that works. <br/>It's really neat because I... They show me a lot of respect. If we were at the equator, it would be a right straight line right over, uh,  which we all...  So this isn't read like a clock then? <br/>No. <br/>Having Bob around is definitely an asset, but I am not looking to take him to  the end. <br/>Probst: Coming up: Corinne's anger gets out of control. <br/>I want to kill Sugar. <br/>I want to kill Sugar. I hate her! I hate her! <br/>Probst: Fang's continuous string of losses and lack of food began to wear on  Crystal's nerves. <br/>13 grains of rice. We can all have two grains. <br/>Eat your rice. <br/>Quit, uh, tell me what I should be doing out here. <br/>Eat your rice! <br/>Shut your mouth! <br/>Shut your mouth! <br/>Probst: GC had had enough. <br/>Probst: GC had had enough. <br/>You ask to leave this game, man, and it's... people pounce on that. on that. GC is quitting. GC is quitting. <br/>That's bull. I don't want to hear it. I'm voting for GC, hands down. He's quit at the challenges, and now he wants to quit the game. now he wants to quit the game. To me, he's a loser. To me, he's a loser. Being out here alone, starving Being out here alone, starving is a mind game  in itself. is a mind game in itself. So that's where I stand. So that's where I stand. <br/>Probst: And that night at Tribal Council, Matty, Kenny, and Crystal granted  GC his and Crystal granted GC his wish. wish. The next day, Crystal's suspicions that Sugar had the hidden immunity idol  were confirmed when she went digging through Sugar's bag and found through  Sugar's bag and found it. it. <br/>We all know that Sugar has the... an immunity idol, and it really changed  things because right now, everybody's scared of that idol. <br/>Probst: Matty continued to fight hard for the Fang tribe. <br/>We gotta move! <br/>Probst: But his teammates just didn't have it in them. Sugar and Kenny both drop out. Kota closing in on a big win and a huge reward. Kota wins reward! And Crystal broke down in tears. <br/>Wah, wah, wah. <br/>Randy's just over-the-top. He's rude. Randy comes off as a snake to me, and to me, he's a troll. <br/>Probst: Fang kept on losing. Kota, you continue to dominate Kota, you continue to dominate in this game. in this game. And at Tribal Council, Kelly And at Tribal Council, Kelly was the next to go. was the next to go. The next day, Sugar dropped the ball and was sent back to Exile Island for a record-breaking  fifth time. And Kota won a big reward. And Kota won a big reward. Should be a fun afternoon. Should be a fun afternoon. Kota took a journey to a remote part of Eden for a lavish picnic. <br/>Let's get our blanket out. <br/>Let's get our blanket out. <br/>Dig into the food. <br/>Sardines! <br/>Tomato and cucumbers. <br/>Oh, wow! <br/>Man! <br/>We got sardines now? <br/>Oh, my God, onions! <br/>Oh, my God, Bob got us sardines. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>We've got avocados. <br/>Did you ever think we'd be standing on a cliff in Gabon sipping champagne in  clothing and underwear we've been in for 18 days, 19 days? We knew we were going to get some sandwiches, but that's all we knew. <br/>Chocolate? <br/>Chocolate! <br/>Chocolate! <br/>It turns out it was a very involved picnic. This was not your average, like, schmo picnic. <br/>What about this? <br/>Those are gherkins. <br/>Pickles, those'll last. <br/>Yeah, I'd like to have one of those. <br/>They're passing around things like gherkins, really simple small pickles. Nobody knows... "What are these? Are these African?"  This smells like cat food. <br/>That's pÃ¢tÃ    . <br/>We use its stink back for the catfish. <br/>No, no, no, it's expensive. We do not do that. Who doesn't know what pÃ¢tÃ     is? Prosciutto. "What is Bleu cheese?" I mean, these are not non-American or  foreign things. It was maddening. <br/>We are so having diarrhea tonight. <br/>At least I'll be drunk. Maybe I won't remember it. <br/>Speaking of drunk, who's-who's on the next bottle? <br/>What is this-- the deal with this bottle? <br/>I think you have to do it with... by bottle. <br/>I don't think... you guys own that bottle between the two of you? <br/>No, no, they don't. <br/>I don't care. <br/>It becomes less enjoyable when you have to worry about divvying everything up  because everybody's always conscious of, "Is he getting more?"  Randy's sucking it down. <br/>Unfortunately, you get these great experiences, but you have to share them  with people you can't stand. I-I'd rather be serving up I-I'd rather be serving up poison to these people. poison to these people. poison to these people. <br/>Probst: Sugar spent so much time on Exile Island that after finding the idol  on her first trip, her biggest enemy in the game was boredom, but she found  game was boredom, but she found ways to stay occupied. ways to stay occupied. <br/>I got sick of wearing a leopard dress, and, uh, I don't have any other  clothes, so, uh, I'm looking kind of crazy these days. This is my Mary Ann look. Do you like it? <br/>Probst: When she was tired, she'd hit the hammock. She spent her days picking flowers and berries; basking in the sun in her own  private Eden was a joy. She even had her own swimming pool. But nothing was better than biting into the apple of Eden. <br/>I'm so happy. [laughs] I could cry. [laughs]  Probst: And she did. She actually felt guilty about her good fortune. <br/>Why do I get to come back here and-and eat fruit when everybody's starving at  my tribe, and they're running out of food. I'm feeling really guilty. <br/>Probst: Sugar's many days on Exile kept her out of the politics of camp and  helped her transform from an inexperienced girl to a power player. <br/>I learned that I may be a little tougher than I thought. I maybe have underestimated myself. Exile Island wasn't so bad for me. <br/>Probst: The next day, a surprising announcement was made. Bad news is both tribes are going to Tribal Council tonight. The good news: each of you will have an equal shot at will have an equal shot  at winning... individual immunity. winning... individual immunity. Marcus won individual immunity. Congratulations. And had the power to give another immunity necklace to someone from the other  tribe. <br/>I'm going to give this to Sugar. <br/>Probst: Sugar found herself doubly protected with individual immunity and the  hidden idol. Sugar is safe at tonight's Tribal Council for Fang. Tribal Council for Fang. Marcus is safe for Kota's. Marcus is safe for Kota's. Back at camp, Kenny's mind games came into play when he lied to Sugar about  her strongest ally, Ace, wanting to blindside her. <br/>Honest to God truth, this is what's happening around camp. I'm not... I'm not lying to you. Ace thinks he has you wrapped around his finger. This guy is a snake. We blindside Ace.... <br/>Blindside Ace tonight. <br/>...and we don't have to worry about the snake ever again. <br/>Probst: Sugar bought the lie, and it was Ace who was blindsided at Tribal  Council. blindsided at Tribal Council. At the Kota Tribal Council, Dan was voted out. The tribe has spoken. The tribe has spoken. When the tribes came together for a feast...  This is nuts! <br/>Probst: ...they assumed the merge had come. During the meal, Kenny spotted a clue. <br/>What? <br/>I feel like you guys should take a look, too. <br/>What does it say? <br/>"You have just discovered a clue to another hidden immunity idol."  Probst: But no one wanted to take the idol for fear of seeming too aggressive. <br/>It's the apple in the garden of Eden. <br/>Yeah, you want the apple, take it, but no...  Probst: So in the end, the tribes did the unthinkable. <br/>One last time, anybody who wants immunity, it's theirs. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Who wants it? <br/>The ocean wants it. <br/>The ocean! <br/>Probst: Randy and Marcus were so confident that they ditched the one thing  that could save them. <br/>These people are so stupid. I got ten people to throw an immunity idol into the ocean. It's never been done. <br/>With all due respect to President Bongo, I am the new king of Gabon. I'm sorry, but I rule. This ocean-- it's mine. <br/>Probst: And just when they thought a merge was on the horizon...  Oh, man. <br/>Number one...  Here we go. <br/>Probst: ...they found another switch was in store. <br/>The new Kota tribe is Bob and Marcus and-and Susie, Crystal and Kenny. <br/>I'll see you. <br/>The new Fang tribe: myself, Charlie, and Corinne and then we've got Matty and  Sugar. <br/>Probst: At Fang, Matty told Sugar she was duped by Kenny. <br/>Wow! <br/>Ace was covering you the whole time. <br/>I know. I know. <br/>He never was gunning for you. <br/>I didn't know. I think Kenny and Crystal duped me. I feel awful that I got rid of Ace. <br/>Probst: At the next immunity challenge, Matty's inner strength and physical  stamina single-handedly won a heroic victory for Fang. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Matty wins immunity for the Fang tribe. Facing Tribal Council, Marcus was confident and acted like he was still in  control of the game. <br/>I don't want you to go home. And know that Susie is going to campaign for it, and the only way that I feel  like we can make the switch would be to have Ken go home and you stay. <br/>Marcus and I now have a solid relationship, but when you start talking about  knocking off mynumber one ally, just so you can go farther in the game, I'm  not pleased at all. <br/>Probst: Then Marcus had a chat with Susie. <br/>My thought was tonight Ken and then, if hopefully we don't have to go for a  while, but then Crystal will be next. <br/>Probst: But Crystal told  Probst: But Crystal told Kenny about Marcus's plan. Kenny about Marcus's plan. <br/>What do you mean? What do you mean? <br/>Probst: And all of sudden,  Probst: And all of sudden, Susie was the key. Susie was the key. <br/>I have a huge decision to make tonight on which way to go, either Marcus or  Bob, or I can vote with Kenny and Crystal. <br/>Probst: And that night at Tribal Council, the person responsible for dumping  the idol now needed it and was voted out. Ninth person voted out of Survivor: Gabon,and the first member of our jury.... member of our jury.... Marcus. Marcus. At the next reward challenge, Fang was in shock that Marcus was gone. <br/>He didn't deserve to leave the game. <br/>Probst: And Kenny's confidence was growing. <br/>Then who does? Who does deserve to leave the game? <br/>I could not believe they had gotten rid of Marcus. It was so heartbreaking, just because that really damages my chances at the  game. <br/>Probst: But Fang won the challenge. <br/>Hey, we won! <br/>Probst: And Bob was sent to Exile Island. Bob, grab your stuff. [shouting] Matty and his tribe enjoyed some real African culture and food at  a local village in Gabon. <br/>I know. <br/>Probst: While over on Exile, Bob searched for the idol, not knowing that  Sugar already had it. <br/>The fourth clue got me completely perplexed. <br/>Probst: Bob decided he couldn't leave Exile Island empty-handed, so he made  his first major strategic move. <br/>I'm going to make something that looks like an idol so that they think I have  an idol. Sort of like when you're holding up a bank. You don't necessarily need the gun, but if they think you've got a gun, they  might leave you alone. alone. This is my new fake idol. This is my new fake idol. <br/>Probst: Coming up, Randy stirs up trouble around camp. <br/>Desperate times, man, call for desperate measures. <br/>Shut up, Randy. <br/>Shut up, Randy. You're being a lunatic. You're being a lunatic. <br/>Probst: At the next immunity challenge, the merge was finally announced. Your merge. <br/>Oh, wow! <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: And Susie surprised everyone by winning immunity. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Susie wins immunity! Back at the newly merged camp...  People bounced into the jungle and started their strategies. <br/>Probst: ...Charlie and Randy were gunning for Crystal. <br/>Crystal's the way to go. <br/>Crystal's the way to go. Bob will vote Crystal. Bob will vote Crystal. <br/>Probst: With Sugar in the middle, Corinne and Charlie tried to convince her  to vote with the old Kota. with the old Kota. <br/>Yeah. I'm...  Yeah. I'm...  We can do Randy next. <br/>Probst: What Charlie didn't know was that Matty, Susie, Crystal, and Kenny  had a different victim in mind. <br/>This is some real. This is the realness over here. <br/>Write down Charlie. Write down Charlie. <br/>Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. <br/>Probst: And Kenny tried to pull Sugar over to his side. <br/>Charlie is the brains behind all of it. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Knowing the vote was in her hands, Sugar had to decide whether to go  with her old tribe or her new allies, who promised to take her to the end. And that night at Tribal Council, Sugar's vote sealed the deal, and the early  underdogs suddenly became the clear frontrunners in the game. Tenth person voted out of Survivor: Gabon... Charlie. With Charlie gone, Bob, Randy, and Corinne found themselves in the minority  of a tribe led by Sugar. <br/>Even though I don't like the way you've been talking-- negative and  everything-- I thought maybe you could learn from me by telling you and-and...   Let your countenance be your light. <br/>Yeah, a little bit. I know that sounds stupid, though. <br/>But that's how some people need to learn. <br/>Right, so I'm just letting you know that I hate the way you've been, but-but  I know that you're not a bad person. You just got a little out of hand. <br/>So this morning, I'm in the hut, and Sugar decides that she's going to teach  me a lesson about life. <br/>We had one good conversation. The rest the time, it was you and Randy talking about everybody else. And it's just... It's a negative way of being, and it was happening so much,  I was just like, "Oh, my God. It's like cancer in my ears." It's, like, all the complaints. Nothing was good enough. It was horrible. Okay, I don't want to keep harping on it. I just want you to realize that everything that you say is-is noted, you  know, and-and...  All right. <br/>You know? Okay, cool. I'm sorry. I just wanted to... to talk to you about it. <br/>From a girl who is-- I'm sorry-- a non-college-graduate waitress who's out of  work. She doesn't even have a waitress job. She lives off the "kindness" of others. I don't like people that live off the kindness of others. There is no honor in that. Just more like a second to vent. I want to kill Sugar. I hate her. <br/>She's horrible. <br/>You don't understand. She pulls me into the tent, and she's like, "I know that you were making  fun of me, and I know what you and Randy said, and you don't even know me,  and I want to teach you about forgiveness and about how being nice to people  is better than being mean." So I was, like, "You know, I don't have  any friends. You're the only person I have left." I'm sitting there, like, cringing. Like, "Really, bitch, you're going to teach me something? I'm gonna teach you something."  She's the worst person in the world. It's people like that that are so self-righteous...  Oh! Oh, my God! <br/>...and high-and-mighty that are a million times more evil than me. <br/>My favorite... My favorite is, like, she's so stupid...  That it's dangerous. <br/>Yes! And I'm just, like... I never complained. She's the one who keep... She's always complaining about where she sleeps. She's complaining about where she's sitting. I won't... I can't even... I just... You don't understand. All that gets me through the day is, I've rehearsed the speech I'm gonna give  after they say my name at Tribal. I'm gonna turn on her and be, like, "You know what the best part about  going home is? I don't have to pretend to like you anymore."  Exactly. <br/>I'm gonna be nastyat Tribal. <br/>Yeah, I know. <br/>Oh, there. Go, go, go, go. At the very least, I have the jury. We'll give the million to who we want to give the million to, and trust that  won't be Sugar. I don't know who it will be, but it won't be Sugar. So, her little teaching me a lesson? Really? This is how the lesson goes, bitch. <br/>Probst: Now with no alliance left, Bob showed Sugar his only asset. <br/>I couldn't find it anywhere. I made a fake one. <br/>Oh, my God. That's awesome. <br/>Probst: At the next reward challenge, a Survivorauction was full of surprises. If you see something you like, you should bid on it. <br/>"Send yourself or someone else to Exile Island."  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. <br/>I'll take Bob. I'm sorry, Bob. <br/>Probst: Bob, get your personal items. You're going back to Exile Island. You will return in time for the next immunity challenge. And Randy thought he'd soften his image with a plate of cookies. <br/>$20. <br/>Probst: Sold to Randy. <br/>Oh, my God, Randy. <br/>Would you like one? <br/>I couldn't possibly. <br/>Probst: But Sugar couldn't hide her dislike for Randy. Randy, you're giving Sugar's to Corinne? <br/>Sugar doesn't have one. I offered her one, and she didn't take one. <br/>Probst: But he couldn't charm Sugar. <br/>Last chance. You can have a full one. <br/>Probst: And he lost his last cookie when Sugar snatched it up and gave it to  Matty. <br/>That cookie's tainted. <br/>Probst: Back at camp, Randy just couldn't let it go. <br/>That wasn't a gift from her, man. That was my cookie. I didn't get one. You had two. I had none. <br/>Sorry. <br/>I left the auction half drunk and pissed off. <br/>Probst: Unaware that Sugar had the hidden immunity idol, Randy bet on Bob  finding the idol at Exile and giving it to him, so he cooked up a last-ditch  scheme with Corinne. <br/>FYI, I'm going to be crashing and burning all day, making everybody miserable. Our only prayer is if Bob would give me the idol. <br/>I love it. <br/>It's our only prayer. <br/>That's a great plan. <br/>Probst: Randy purposefully made himself irritating to get made himself  irritating to get people to vote for him. people to vote for him. [Randy imitates yawning]  Oh, my God, don't do this, dude. Don't. <br/>What are you going to do, vote me out? Desperate times, man, call for desperate measures. <br/>Shut up, Randy! You're being a lunatic. <br/>Well...  Be nice, bro. <br/>I got to do what I got to do. There's not a normal person among these idiots, except you, and you even  whored yourself out. You know you have. You know, I don't blame you. It's worth a million dollars to you. It's not to me. <br/>Oh, my God. [Randy laughing]  It's a no-brainer that Randy has to go home now, so everybody's a little  paranoid today about him burning the camp down, dumping our food, ravaging  people's personal ravaging people's personal items. items. <br/>I'm just scared he's going to dump out the coffee, throw the beans and rice  into the woods, or whatever. <br/>Yeah. He's just not happy right now. <br/>But he dug his own grave. There's a reason he's leaving. <br/>You just got to keep an eye out. <br/>I don't know why he's still here. <br/>I can't even believe he's still here. <br/>Well, first we have to beat him at this challenge. <br/>I think he's crazy. I think he might be crazy. <br/>This is ridiculous. <br/>Uh-uh. <br/>Randy got to go. Randy needs to go. He is a troll. He is wreaking havoc in the Nobag tribe. <br/>Probst: The next immunity challenge turned up the pressure on Randy. Kenny wins immunity! With Randy on his last legs, With Randy on his last legs, Bob was his only  hope. Bob was his only hope. Bob was his only hope. <br/>Probst: Bob put out the bait. <br/>Probst: Bob put out the bait. <br/>Probst: And Randy bit down...  I'm here for three more days. Looks like an idol to me. <br/>Probst: ...figuring he had the game in his pocket. <br/>I cannot wait to see this. You are awesome. <br/>Probst: And that night at Tribal Council, Randy smugly made his last move. But the joke was on him. This is not a hidden immunity idol. [laughter] And he was the 11th person voted out of Survivor: Gabon. voted out of Survivor: Gabon. Randy, the tribe has spoken. Randy, the tribe has spoken. Well, after tonight's Tribal Council, it's very clear this game is coming  down to one thing: trust. Can't wait to see how it plays out. Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
