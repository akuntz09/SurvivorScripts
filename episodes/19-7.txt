<br/>(thunder crashes)  Jeff Probst: previously on Survivor: after 15 days, the biggest threat to  both tribes was the weather. The Foa Foa tribe was hit the hardest. <br/>I have never in my life been this cold, had my hands this destroyed, and my  feet look so miserable. <br/>Probst: And while the constant rain and cold sucked the life out of most of  them, Russell thrived. <br/>They're just a bunch of babies. This is really no big deal. As a matter of fact, this makes me stronger. <br/>Probst: At Galu, a brief break in the rain along with their huge 9-to-5  numbers advantage made things a lot more bearable. But at the immunity challenge, both tribes got some shocking news: Both  tribes going to Tribal Council. Both tribes will vote somebody out tonight. (thunder crashes) Then the brutal conditions caught up to Russell, the  captain of Galu, who passed out due to a combination of dehydration and  exhaustion. There's no question to all of us watching, brother, that, that you are not  okay. For his own safety, Russell was taken out of the game, leaving his tribe  without a leader. Prior to Tribal Council, the majority of the Foa Foa tribe decided to send  Liz home. <br/>I'm putting Liz, you putting Liz. I know I can talk Mick into putting Liz no matter what. <br/>Probst: While the majority of Galu decided to send Monica home. <br/>Monica doesn't help us win challenges at all. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, everyone's plans were put on hold when out of  respect for Russell's traumatic medical evacuation, the vote was canceled. Nobody will be voted out tonight. The loss of Russell re-ignited the rivalry between the two tribes. <br/>Every bead of sweat that he put into everything he ever did, we're bringing  that to you. <br/>We welcome it. <br/>Probst: But it also provided Foa Foa with a growing glimmer of hope. <br/>I really believe that the tables are about to turn. <br/>Probst: 13 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Losing Russell affects the game tremendously. You know, losing our chief. Losing probably the guy who I had the most confidence in personally in this  game. <br/>He played the game like he was 35, and he's not. <br/>Yeah. <br/>With Russell here, we had a 5-4 gender-alliance lead, but now with Russell  gone, it's just 4-4, and it's anybody's ball game. Exactly. <br/>Exactly. <br/>Even though she's a chick, Shambo doesn't fit in with the other girls. So we have to pull Shambo back over to our side and make sure that Shambo is  like one of the dudes. <br/>The only way that plan unravels is if the girls lock in Shambo. <br/>Bros before hoes, period. <br/>Dude. (theme song playing) *  Here we go again. Day 16. <br/>Wake up, McDreamy. Let's do it. <br/>Tribal was real nice. When Jeff said we wasn't going to eliminate anybody, and I knew Galu just  lost big Russell, man, I was stoked. I was, like, "Oh, we have a shot at this." You know, it's 5 to 8  now, it's pretty damn close. <br/>Liz wasn't voted out, but it keeps the tribe stronger by keeping her. So I'd rather just win three in a row and then get rid of her. <br/>It could be a new day. The tides have turned. <br/>That's right. It is a new day. That's right. <br/>Start with this one. <br/>I'm so excited! <br/>So am I. (yawns)  So I was thinking about it, thinking about it, thinking about it, and the way  we're going to lock Shambo in is not only to, you know, to tell her,  "Hey, we're cool with you," but us four guys are gonna nominate  Shambo our new new chief. And she's gonna feel so so important and so flattered that she'll be as deep  in my pocket as the lint at the very bottom. You know, this tribe does need a new leader. And I think you're the best for the job. <br/>Okay. We've got to put it to a vote, though. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, we need to do that. <br/>Okay. Okay. <br/>Ready? One...  ...two...  ...three...  ...four...  ...five...  ...six...  ...seven...  ...eight. <br/>Okay. <br/>So, at the count of three, you just put up the number. <br/>Okay. <br/>One... ...two... ...three. <br/>Okay, so wait. How many threes? <br/>Four threes. <br/>Four, four. So that's...  Four votes for Sham. <br/>Four votes for Sham. <br/>Sham's the leader. <br/>Congratulations. (man laughs)  I thought the way to elect the new leader was stupid. It went by so quickly that no one even really realized what happened. Um, I don't know how Shambo got elected leader. And they're supposed to be sending Shambo home last night. I'm wondering if there was a vote last night, would I have been one of the  people voted for? <br/>Okay, I would like my first act of... to be one of motivation and kindness. I, obviously, did not ask for this. I will do the best I can by you guys. My leadership style is night and day from Russ, and I will honestly,  honestly, honestly do my due diligence to not be bossy 'cause you can't  really be a sergeant in the United States Marine Corps and not have an  expectation when you say something, things will happen. <br/>I think us four guys plus using Shambo as a wedge is a good plan. I mean, the only strategic drawbacks I could think of is that Shambo is just  so dim that she could screw up our plans if we tell her anything. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! How's everybody doing? The sun is out. <br/>Very thankful. <br/>Happy, happy, happy. <br/>Probst: Shambo, you're wearing the leadership necklace. You're the leader of Galu? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: Surprised? <br/>Not so much. I've had a lifetime of leadership skills through just the way I was raised;  second-generation Marine, so I just gotta keep things in perspective and be  calm. <br/>Probst: All right, we're going to put your leadership skills to test today. You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yep. <br/>Definitely. <br/>Probst: Today's challenge will test your memory and will force to you make  decisions between wants and needs. Here's how it works: scattered out in the field there are 13 pairs of  matching survival items. One tribe member at a time will walk out and uncover two items. If they match, you score a point for your tribe. If at any point along the way, the leader of your tribe decides they would  like to keep the items you just matched, you can do so, but you forfeit the  point in the challenge. To make things more difficult, four of the items are dummy items that do not  have a match. The tribe who has the most points at the end of challenge wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Winning tribe will leave from here and board a beautiful sailboat. <br/>Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. <br/>Probst: You'll enjoy an afternoon out on the water and a nice lunch. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: In addition, the winning tribe will send one person from their tribe  to the losing tribe to do a little spying until the next immunity challenge. You guys ready to get to it? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: Galu you're sitting out three people this challenge. This is a new cycle. You can sit out whoever you you want. <br/>Kelly, Dave, and myself will sit out. <br/>Probst: Kelly, Dave, and Shambo. You guys take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right, Shambo, since you are the new leader and you are not  participating, who do you want to assign to make decisions for Galu in this  challenge? <br/>Erik. <br/>No, no, Brett, Brett, Brett. <br/>I stand corrected; Brett. <br/>Probst: Brett will be the fill-in leader for this challenge. All right, head out. Russell goes out first for Foa Foa, who won the rock, paper, scissor. That is a fire-starting kit. That is representative of what the real kit looks like. It is much larger. And rope, no match. Cover 'em back up. Galu. John heads out for his first shot at this challenge. John finds the cleaver. Right next door, mosquito net. No match for Galu. Should get interesting now. Jaison heading out for Foa Foa. A lantern and oil. That has not been revealed anywhere else so it's a wild guess, shot in the  dark. Fire starting kit. No match. <br/>That's a big break. Big break. <br/>I got it. <br/>Probst: Galu. <br/>Go get it, Laura. <br/>Probst: Laura going out now. Looking for that first match. Laura finds one fire starting kit. Jaison just uncovered one. Can Laura remember where it was? And she does. Laura scores the first match for Galu. As I said, that is merely representative. This is the kit. Everything you need to get fire started all wrapped in a tarp. <br/>We'll keep it. <br/>Thank God. <br/>Probst: Brett's going to keep this one. <br/>Good job, Galu. <br/>Good job, team. <br/>That tarp's gonna keep us dry, right? Right? <br/>Probst: Galu scores the first match but forfeits the point in exchange for  keeping the item. We're still at 0-0. Foa Foa, head out. Liz with her first time out on the course would love to get lucky. Liz finds the cleaver. <br/>Oh, gosh, Liz, come on. <br/>Probst: Can Liz remember where the other cleaver was? She guesses wrong, she could reveal an item that helps Galu. Liz reveals a mosquito net. Not a match. Opening the door for Galu. Brett out on the course. Wasted no time. Brett finds the mosquito netting. Now he's got to pair it up. And he does. <br/>Good job. <br/>Probst: Galu with a match. Brett, you're keeping that item or are you keeping the point? <br/>Point. <br/>Probst: Galu with their first point. Galu now leads one-zip. <br/>Shh! <br/>Liz, I gotta talk if I'm gonna figure out where this stuff is. <br/>But we need to whisper. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa, you're up. <br/>Do you know where the other cleaver was? it was right over here. <br/>Probst: Natalie, first time out on the course. Foa Foa needs a match. <br/>I'm trying to decide. <br/>Probst: You're on your own when you're out here. You cannot get help from your tribe. Natalie reveals a hammock. Natalie finds a pot. Does not match. This challenge not as easy as it seems. Lot of items out here. It gets hard to remember. John matches for Galu. Galu leads 2-zip. Russell pairs up for Foa Foa. Laura reveals rope and matching rope. It is now 3-1. Jaison reveals hammer and nails. No match for Foa Foa. (humming tune)  Probst: Erik has a cocky swagger. Not a match. Nick reveals the blanket... Another match for Foa Foa. No match for Galu... Erik chooses wrong... Brett out on the course. And Brett matches it up. <br/>Yes! <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: For Galu. <br/>Good job, B. Good job, B. <br/>Probst: Mask, snorkel and a spear goes along with that. Brett is that an item you're considering keeping? <br/>Point. <br/>Probst: Everybody choosing points over items. That reward looking good. Galu now leads six-three. There are only three items left out here. The rest are dummy items that do not have a match. Do the math, Foa Foa. All Galu needs to do is match one more pair, and they win this challenge. Foa Foa, head out. Natalie out on the course. Natalie finds the pot. She'd like to match that up, score a point for her tribe. <br/>Let's see. Let's see. Oh, my word. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa needs to match this up. <br/>Yay! <br/>Probst: Natalie matches up the pots. (indistinct chatter) Foa Foa staying in it. It's now six-four. If Galu matches on this turn, they win the challenge. Monica out on the course and on her own now. Monica reveals the eating utensils. If she can match this up, Galu wins. And she does with confidence. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Galu wins reward. <br/>(screaming): Yes! <br/>Probst: Galu, under the new leadership of Shambo, you continue to do very  well in this game. Not only do you win a beautiful reward and a nice afternoon, you're taking  back with you a fire-making kit and a tarp. All right, Shambo, you now have another big decision to make. You have to now send somebody from your tribe over to Foa Foa, which means  they will not go on the sailboat. They will not have an afternoon lunch. They will not get a break from camp. Who are you going to send over to Foa Foa? <br/>I'm going to send Laura over to Foa Foa because I need to keep my guys strong  for our challenge tomorrow, and I'm not sending myself for a third time. <br/>Probst: Laura, how does that sound to you? <br/>I'll take it for the team. <br/>Now that Shambo's chief, it's like she was raised in a trailer park, married  a rich guy, and now she's driving around in a Jaguar treating everyone like  crap, you know? She sent Laura over to the other tribe, and Laura's one of our strongest  females. I don't know if she has a strategy, I don't know if she's just pulling it out  of her ass, I don't know. <br/>Probst: Laura will return to Galu at the next immunity challenge. Galu, grab your tarp, head out. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Boat's waiting for you. <br/>Got it? All right. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>It's just like, we just walk away losing again, but we do have a pox or a hex  or some kind of curse on Foa Foa. I don't know. I'm starting to get superstitious at this point, you know? <br/>Hello. I'm Natalie. <br/>I'm Laura. Nice to meet you. <br/>Nice to meet you, Laura. <br/>Finally. <br/>Hey, Laura. Mick. <br/>Hi, Mick. <br/>Good to formally meet you, finally. <br/>Good to formally meet you. <br/>Pleasure. <br/>I'm Liz. <br/>Hi, Liz. Good to meet you. <br/>Hi. How are you? <br/>Good. Hi, Russell. Good to meet you. <br/>Nice to meet you. <br/>Welcome. <br/>This is home, huh? At Foa Foa camp, everybody is really friendly. Um, they're doing their very best to make me feel comfortable, and I  sincerely appreciate it. <br/>Yeah... I figured Shambo would send me. <br/>Oh, really? <br/>Yeah, I figured she would send me over. <br/>Hmm. <br/>So... it's all right, though. <br/>Yeah. <br/>There's definitely an undercurrent why Sham sent me over to the Foa Foa tribe. I mean... I mean, clearly, she doesn't like me. Oh, thank you! <br/>That's for you. <br/>Thank you! <br/>You want to come with me and find some crabs, show you how to do this? <br/>Yes! Absolutely. Okay, so you have twins. <br/>Mm-hmm. I have twin girls that's nine. My dad's a preacher. <br/>He is? I'm a theology student. <br/>Really? <br/>Mm-hmm. I got my degree in women's ministries. <br/>Really? <br/>I don't want to be a pastor of men. I don't believe that, um...  Mm-hmm. <br/>...that's the women's role. <br/>Yeah, but anyway, I'm glad you came here...  Wow. <br/>...and if you want to listen, I'll have something that I can bring to the  table. <br/>I'll totally listen. <br/>Uh, I think, eventually, your butt's going to be on the chopping block. <br/>Totally. <br/>It might not be as fast as mine, but eventually, it will. But if we can get together, you could protect me at the merge, and I can  protect you. You know, when it comes down to it, I hope it's final three, 'cause you know  what I hope? I would hope it would be me, you and Natalie in the final three. Well, I was happy when they decided to send Laura to our camp, because it  doesn't look like we're going to go with numbers into a merge, so what I have  to do now is work my Houdini magic on Laura. I can spot a good Christian any time. It's easy. So I'm starting to really like you now. (Laura laughs)  Brother from another mother. <br/>So, I'm going to start working her, working her, working her like a fine tool. You know, until she's sharpened enough just where I want her. I swear to you, you can trust me. <br/>What are we going to do, go to the final two, the two of us together? <br/>Final two. <br/>Russell came to me and was conspiring to have this secret alliance that,  clearly, nobody would ever suspect. And, you know, that's another card that I stick in my pocket that I might  want to play. I mean, you know, it's just food for thought. <br/>And by the way, that clue you have? <br/>Yeah. <br/>You might as well throw it away. There's no immunity idol here. <br/>Did you find it? <br/>Ben found it and didn't play it. Hid it somewhere in the camp. (indistinct chatter)  Oh, my gosh! (indistinct chatter)  Awesome. <br/>Wow! <br/>The reward was phenomenal. We're on this rowboat, headed toward a pirate ship in the middle of the  islands of Samoa, and honestly, I just felt like I don't even deserve that,  you know? Like, what have I ever done in life that has been so great that deserves that  kind of an opportunity? (applause, indistinct chatter)  Are we helping, or are we watching? <br/>Uh, you're doing both. <br/>Excellent. <br/>Yay! Yay! <br/>Haul away! <br/>Haul away, come on! (whooping, indistinct chatter)  Yeah, get it E! <br/>Use your youthful exuberance of the purple team. <br/>That's the spirit! (laughter, indistinct chatter)  Ahoy, matey! <br/>Ahoy, matey! <br/>Come on! (whooping)  You have to turn the wheel to the right. <br/>Okay. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Wait! (screams and whoops) (whooping)  I'm a sailor! <br/>A pirate ship! <br/>You're, like, the captain of a pirate ship ready to go rob some booty. (laughter) A little gold, a little wenchin', a little groggin'. A little more wenchin'. Uh-oh, look what's coming out. Oh, baby. <br/>Oh! <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Yay! <br/>Yes! They fed us this beef stew that was delicious. It was almost all meat and a big chunk of handmade bread and these amazing  scones. They were delicious. I was having a good time, man. <br/>This is so beautiful. What a nice change after 16 days of hell. My God! Thank you, Lord. <br/>And I appreciate you not sending me. Shambo ended up sending Laura to the other camp. I think it just was her own little way of saying, "I'mn "leader  now, and what I say goes." I mean, she'd never admit that. <br/>I didn't relish the thought of sending anybody over there, but I'm also not  gonna feel bad about it because I think that I did the right thing by the  tribe, I really do. *  I would've never guessed that in a million years. That's cool. <br/>As long as we have a flame... And I was just, like, "Yeah."  You know, I understand we have a guest. You know, Laura's come here to hang out with us until the next immunity  challenge, but I don't really need to hear her and Natalie talking about the  spiritual book of, you know, spiritual book of the month, like, behind my  back, when I'm trying to get a fire started so that we can eat and drink. <br/>Whoo! I'm going get my hands washed. Do you need to do any kind of laundry or anything? <br/>Oh, gosh. <br/>It's just really infuriating because they're not helping. It's time to start a fire. All they're doing is sitting there picking their toes and, like, catching up  on good times. So it was really, really frustrating, disappointing, and at times, rather  infuriating. This is like a crisis, and they're talking about their faith and books. Russell, I understand we have a guest, but they're talking about book-of-the-month  club. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Damn! <br/>Liz is so stupid. I don't even see how she can walk without falling down. It's just ridiculous. If we merge, we need somebody on the inside, and Natalie's doing a good job  talking to Laura around the camp. So I have to keep Natalie for my little toy. You know, she has to be there for me so I can manipulate her little mind and  do what I want her to do. When it comes to this game, you better be street smart, and Liz has a mouth  on her, and I don't think she knows when to shut up so I'm going to keep my  eye on her. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! All right, Laura, you can now rejoin Galu. Galu is back intact. You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: First things first, Brett, take back immunity. Thank you. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Probst: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, both tribes will paddle out to retrieve fish-shaped  puzzle pieces. Once you've collected all six sets, you'll then paddle back where three tribe  members will use those pieces to solve a puzzle. First tribe to get it right wins immunity; safe from the vote. Losers... Tribal Council; somebody going home. Galu, last challenge it was Shambo, Kelly, and Dave Ball who sat out, so you  three have to participate. Who are going to be the sit-outs, Shambo? <br/>It's gonna be, uh, John, Monica, and Laura. <br/>Probst: All right, before you go, though, Mick, where's the leadership  necklace? <br/>Uh, well, we left it back, actually. We were, uh, halfway wondering if maybe it was bad luck. <br/>Probst: But you still have a leader? <br/>Yes, absolutely. <br/>Probst: All right. As long as you have a leader, the necklace is merely symbolic. we will see if that is the difference. Laura, Monica, John, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize, we'll get started. Here we go. Galu hoping to continue their dominance. Foa Foa hoping that necklace was, indeed, bad luck. Survivors ready? Go! Three people paddling, two people fishing. <br/>Hop in, Erik. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa using the height of Jaison to still push their boat. Foa Foa starting to pull away now. <br/>Dave, hop out! Guide us, guide us! <br/>I'm up an out! <br/>Probst: Galu now getting in the water trying to push their boat as well. Natalie has one for Foa Foa. <br/>Here you go, here you go. <br/>Right there! Bring it to you. <br/>Probst: Dave Ball has the first one for Galu. <br/>Right here. <br/>Come on, Liz. There you go. Pull it up. <br/>Probst: Liz has one for Foa Foa. Foa Foa moving on to the second station. <br/>Come on, you bitch! Come on! Oh! <br/>Nice job, Liz! <br/>Probst: Liz hooks the third set of puzzle pieces for Foa Foa. <br/>There you go. There you go. <br/>All right, Natalie. <br/>Probst: Natalie has the fourth set! Foa Foa off to an early lead! <br/>Come on, Dave, you can do it. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>You got it right here, Dave. <br/>Probst: Dave has the second set for Galu. <br/>I got it! I got it! You just push! You just push! <br/>Probst: Liz snags the fifth fifth set. Foa Foa has one set left! <br/>All right. I need to concentrate. I need silence, please. <br/>You can do it, Dave. <br/>Be quiet! <br/>Come on, baby. <br/>Yeah, I got it. <br/>I gotcha. I gotcha. <br/>Probst: Dave has the third set, Kelly has the fourth set for Galu. <br/>All right, we're going. Move it! <br/>Probst: Liz and Natalie circling that last set of puzzle pieces. That last string of puzzle pieces. <br/>Get it! Get it! <br/>Probst: Liz has the last string of puzzle pieces for Foa Foa! <br/>Push! Y'all push! <br/>Probst: Better start heading back! <br/>Push! <br/>Get on it, both of you! <br/>Quiet! <br/>Got it. <br/>Probst: Kelly has the fifth set for Galu. <br/>Good job. You got it. <br/>Right here, babe. <br/>Probst: Dave has the sixth set for Galu! Galu now heading back. <br/>All right, Galu! <br/>Probst: Foa Foa has one paddler and two swimmers. <br/>Good job, good job. <br/>Probst: Galu trying to push their boat as well. A lot more work to swim it than it is to paddle it. <br/>Brett, get in the boat now! <br/>Probst: Galu now getting the boat. Everybody paddling. <br/>Full paddle forward! <br/>Paddle! Paddle! <br/>Probst: Galu now using all their paddlers and they are gaining on Foa Foa. <br/>Stroke! Stroke! <br/>Probst: Foa Foa getting it done without Jaison! Foa Foa's hooked in. Get back to your mat. Galu's hooked in. Get back to your mat! (groaning)  Set up time! <br/>Come on. Come on, push, push. <br/>Probst: You can start working on the puzzle any time you like while other  people untie. Liz working on the puzzle for Foa Foa. Dave, Kelly, Brett, working the puzzle for Galu. Jaison, Mick, and Liz working it for Foa Foa. <br/>Here's the last one. They're going to make a line, yeah? <br/>Shh! <br/>Liz, I gotta talk to somebody, all right? Stop shushing me. <br/>Probst: Look for the patterns. Something to help make sense of it. <br/>Look at the colors. Match the colors. <br/>We are, we have! Look. See? <br/>Yeah, that's...  Probst: Jaison frustrated. You can't give up. <br/>Can they fit like this? <br/>Like this? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Every single inch of this may not be filled with fish. There may be gaps in this puzzle. That may be part of the pattern. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa thinks they're on to it. Galu starting to get a pattern pattern going. Follow that pattern. If you've got it, follow it. <br/>Here you go, good job. <br/>Probst: Galu starting to pull away now. Jaison, Liz, and Mick struggling to keep in this. <br/>Goes like this. Yeah, like that. <br/>Probst: Galu thinks they have have it. Galu wins immunity! (all cheering)  Yeah, baby! Right on! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: Galu, once again immunity is yours. Well, Mick, it looks looks like it wasn't the necklace. <br/>We had the pattern, I think, before they did. We just couldn't get the pieces together quick enough. You know, again, it's frustrating. <br/>Probst: All right, Foa Foa, once again Tribal Council tonight where one of  the five of you are going home. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>These idiots are probably gonna cost me a million dollars. I planned on having a lot of fun with the money, a lot of fun. Maybe we need to get rid of Jaison because he gave up out there. He's just standing there looking at the puzzle like it's gonna move itself. We gotta mix something up, so what happens, happens. *  This whole time I wanted to get rid of Liz, get rid of Liz. But you know what? Jaison gave up when we were pushing the boat, and then he was so tired, he couldn't  even get up there and do a puzzle. It's amazing to me that he can't, you know, get these puzzles down. I don't know. He's sure not going to be my attorney. How in the world are they beating us in puzzles, Mick? <br/>I don't know. <br/>Jaison went... You went to medical school, Jaison when to freakin' Oxford,  Stanford. <br/>I know. I know. I know. I know. <br/>Gee! <br/>I can't explain it, my friend. I cannot explain it. <br/>Agreed. <br/>You know, like, when you lose so much, all you want to do is, like, go into, like...  crawl into a hole, fetal position? That's how I feel. <br/>Quite embarrassed. <br/>I don't get it. We were ahead, too. I just don't know what... how we... why we always lose our lead. <br/>I have no idea what's going to happen in this vote tonight. I did not perform well in the puzzle, I don't think. You know, I couldn't get with the program. I kind of felt like dead weight to the team. So, for all I know, they could be voting me out. Well, sorry about my performance on the puzzle. I couldn't figure that thing out to save my life today. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm trying to concentrate on putting it behind me. Hope tomorrow's a brighter day. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay, these are the two options. Now, I've been thinking about this. Natalie, for sure... or...  Yeah? <br/>...Jaison. <br/>I know. <br/>Now listen why. <br/>He's been dragging his feet lately. Yeah. Yeah, go back. <br/>With tonight's Tribal Council, my survivor stock has gone up because I  certainly thought the vote would be between me and Natalie, just because  we're physically, you know, smaller, weaker, than the three guys, but I  guess, strategically, you know, it may make more sense for Jaison to go, and  I'm actually quite thrilled because I never would have anticipated that. <br/>You know, I got a decision to make. It's going to have to be either Liz or Jaison. The thing is, with Liz, I don't know if we can trust her once the merge  happens. But the thing is with Jaison, I still think I can trust the guy, but, you  know, we still got to think about winning in challenges. We're losing with the team we have. We've got to find some way to win. Something has to give. <br/>Probst: Well, there's no use going over the dismal facts. Losing eight out of ten challenges, or the fact that after tonight, you'll be  down to four members, while Galu holds strong at eight. One of the worst overall performances of any tribe in the history of the game. Natalie, what I want to know is, where is the attitude on this tribe? Still hanging in there? <br/>Absolutely. It doesn't do any good, uh, to get negative, so we have to go in to any  challenge with our heads up, because if we don't, then we're done, so...  Probst: Russell, do you still wake up every morning and think, today's the  day? <br/>Yup, every morning. All we really can do is hope for the merge 'cause they outplayed us. They're outlasting us. But one thing I promise you-- them kids over there-- there's no way in hell  that they can outwit me. <br/>Probst: Liz, if you get to a merge, do you trust these guys? <br/>Absolutely. There is no doubt. After all these Tribal Councils, I absolutely trust each and every one of  these people up here with me 100%. <br/>Probst: Mick, any doubt in your mind about the trustworthiness of this group  of people? <br/>Honestly, Jeff, none. The performance aspect-- we haven't done great, obviously. But there's still a social game to be played, and that trust is at the  absolute core of our survival, and we all know that. <br/>Probst: So, Russell, being this tight, got to be hard to vote somebody out  again tonight. <br/>It is very hard. You know, five people down to four people. You know, it almost seems hopeless, but if we can just keep that four  together, then you'll see. You'll see exactly... The whole thing's gonna change. <br/>Probst: Jaison, since we got here, you've been like this all night. Occasionally popping your head up. What's the hardest part about this for you? <br/>I am frustrated with losing, is really what I'm frustrated about. And I actually do feel like I have some large responsibility in these losses. You know, today in the puzzle. You know, I feel like Mick did a really good job figuring out what the  pattern was. I think Liz had the pattern going, but I just couldn't figure out how to see  the pattern at my end, and so, I don't feel like I performed at a level at  which I should have. <br/>Probst: So if you're voted out tonight based on today's performance, would it  be fair? <br/>If they decide that, you know, my performance today warrants me to walk away,  I hope that that is what is necessary for them to win tomorrow. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to vote. Mick, you're up. <br/>This is totally strategic and not at all personal. Sorry. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote-- Jaison. Liz. One vote-- Jaison, one vote-- Liz. Liz. That's two votes Liz, one vote Jaison. Sixth person voted out of Survivor: Samoa-- Liz. That's three. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Probst: Liz, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Well, you haven't been very successful at challenges, but you're getting  really good at blindsides. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor. (indistinct chatter, cheering)  To our new tribe. <br/>New tribe. (whooping)  All of a sudden, all hell breaks loose. <br/>Monica needs to go home tonight. <br/>It's Erik 100%. <br/>I got to do what I got to do. Things are going to get crazy tomorrow out here. <br/>This experience was... It was nothing but intense. My tribe mates outwitted me. It was a very strategic move, and the tables turned so quickly that, you  know, it's a little bit surprising, but kudos to them. I really, really hope that they make it to the end. And this is one hell of a game, so I'm glad I made it as far as I did.
