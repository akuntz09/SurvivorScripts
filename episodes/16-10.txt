<br/> <br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor: On day 22, a merge brought  the two tribes together.  <br/>Eat, drink, and embrace your new tribe.  <br/>Jeff: And five out of the six remaining favorites  rekindled their alliance.  <br/>I'm on the same page with James and Parvati and Ozzy and  Amanda.  <br/>Jeff: But Parvati formed a side alliance with fans Natalie  and Alexis.  <br/>I've put us in an alliance without you being there. I'm in  an alliance with everyone on the island. I'm going to have a decision to  make.  <br/>Jeff: After the merge, Jason and Eliza were the clear  targets.  <br/>I think both we annoy people.  <br/>Jeff: So when Ozzy was beaten by Jason at the immunity  challenge... Nice work. ...Jason gave Eliza what he thought was the hidden  immunity idol. And at tribal council, Eliza played it. This is not a hidden  immunity idol.  <br/>That means Ozzy has it. Jason found it on Exile. Ozzy has  the real one.  <br/>Jeff: And she was voted out... Eliza. ...making her the  first member of the jury. Nine are left. Nine are left. Who will be voted out  tonight? Who will be voted out tonight?  <br/>Jason, what happened? What just happened?  <br/>What do you mean?  <br/>Did you give her an idol?  <br/>Who gave her an idol?  <br/>Jason did.  <br/>That was my only shot at the game. So my plan of trying to  send Ozzy home failed. I'm glad that Eliza played the hidden immunity idol  instead of myself. I would have hated to play the idol and then actually go  home looking like even more of a fool.  <br/>Ozzy found it.  <br/>It was a decoy.  <br/>Yeah. I took a lesson from Yau-Man.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Eliza whipping out that phony hidden immunity idol so  matter-of-factly and looking at all of us like, "Ha!" And I'm  probably like... my heart is going... for a minute I was a little bit  nervous. Like, I thought Ozzy had it, but just a slim chance that she might  have had it. Ozzy would have been gone. The idol would have been played.  Might not have been such a bad Might not have been such a bad thing. thing.  Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION TELEVISION [ theme  song playing] [ theme song playing]  <br/>Ozzy fooled me. He did a good job. I felt kind of silly,  but, you know, in the end, that's not what matters. It's how far you get in  the game. And to go up against Ozzy in the first individual immunity  challenge and win let me know that, you know, Ozzy's not the only godlike  competitor who can play this game. You know, I feel like I could fare pretty  well as long as I fare pretty well as long as I keep continuing to beat Ozzy.  keep continuing to beat Ozzy. keep continuing to beat Ozzy.  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's  challenge?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, you will divide into two  teams of four. On my go, one person from each team will swim out into the  water and crawl through a multilevel net tunnel. When you reach the platform,  you'll study a collection of Micronesian symbols, then race back to the  start. You'll then place as many of those symbols as you can on your answer  board in the same positions as they are on the platform. Then the next person  goes. To make it a little more complicated, you will have extra pieces which  will not match anything. Once your team thinks the board is right, let me  know. If you're wrong, somebody has to go out again. First team to place all  their symbols correctly wins reward. Want to know what you're playing  for?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: The winning team of four will fly to one of the most  cultural places in Micronesia, Yap. You'll enjoy a local dance, a local  feast, and you will spend the night in a traditional Micronesian  bai,typically reserved for chiefs and other dignitaries.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Jeff: You'll return to camp in the morning. Worth playing  for?  <br/>Absolutely worth playing for.  <br/>Jeff: Because we have nine people and we're dividing into  two teams of four, there will be one extra person. The person not chosen will  not participate in the challenge, and will instead go to Exile Island.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Jeff: We're going to draw for captains. We'll do a  schoolyard pick. All right, Jason's a captain. Natalie's a captain. Natalie,  Jason, rock, paper, scissor to see who chooses first.  <br/>On three.  <br/>Yep.  <br/>One, two, three.  <br/>Jeff: Jason won the rock, paper, scissor. Jason, make your  first move.  <br/>Okay, come on over, Ozzy.  <br/>Jeff: Jason choose Ozzy. Natalie, you're up. Who do you  want?  <br/>James.  <br/>Jeff: Jason, your pick.  <br/>Eric, come on over.  <br/>Natalie, who is your next choice?  <br/>Parvati.  <br/>Jeff: Parvati joins James and Natalie. We're down to  three. Jason, your pick?  <br/>Amanda, come on over.  <br/>Jeff: All right, Natalie, one choice left. It's Alexis or  Cirie. The person you do not choose is going to Exile Island.  <br/>Alexis.  <br/>Jeff: Alexis joins Natalie, James, and Parvati. All right,  Cirie.  <br/>Bye, y'all. Have fun.  <br/>Jeff: You will return to this game at the next immunity  challenge. All right, we have our two teams of four. I'll give you a minute  to strategize, we'll get started. Here we go. For reward. Survivors ready?  Go! Jason and Parvati out first. Into the water, and through the net  tunnel.  <br/>Go, baby, go!  <br/>Go, baby, go!  <br/>Jeff: Jason flying over it.  <br/>Jeff: Jason flying over it. Jason in the water swimming to  the platform.  <br/>Go, Parv!  <br/>Jeff: Jason studying those symbols. Trying to remember as  many as he can. Parvati now on the platform.  <br/>Take your time, girl!  <br/>Jeff: Jason heading back. Parvati heading back. If you  call it and you're wrong, somebody else has got to swim out before you can  make any changes.  <br/>Let's go, let's go!  <br/>Jeff: Jason screaming through that tunnel on the way back.  Parvati right on his tail.  <br/>Good job, girl!  <br/>Jeff: Jason first back to the answer board. Parvati back  to the answer board. Not only do you have to remember the symbols you saw on  the other board, you have to differentiate between the fake pieces. Parvati's  done. Alexis heading out. Jason taking his time on that board. Ozzy heading  out for the orange team. Alexis out for the purple team.  <br/>Go, Ozzy!  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy flying through  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy flying through that tunnel. that tunnel. Ozzy  and Alexis studying the symbols. Ozzy heading back for one. Alexis still  studying. Ozzy back to the answer board.  <br/>All right, you got this!  <br/>Jeff: Alexis back for purple.  <br/>Jeff: Alexis back for purple.  <br/>Good girl!  <br/>Good girl!  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy putting in a lot of pieces.  <br/>Don't worry, Alexis. Just focus. Remember those  symbols.  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy finishes his turn. Erik now out on the course  Alexis really taking her time, trying to be right. Alexis finishes her turn.  James heading out on the course. James heading out on the course. Erik to the  platform. Erik to the platform. Erik to the platform. James to the platform.  James to the platform.

Erik and James both coming back.  <br/>Come on, James.  <br/>Come on, James.  <br/>Jeff: James finished with his turn. Natalie now out on the  course.  <br/>Go, Nat.  <br/>Jeff: Erik finished with his turn. Amanda is heading out  on the course. Amanda is to the platform. Natalie heading back for purple.  Amanda studying those symbols. It is better to be right than fast.  <br/>Good job, Nat.  <br/>Jeff: Natalie back to the answer board  <br/>You got it, girl.  <br/>Jeff: Remember the answer key and the finished answer  board have to match.  <br/>Come on, Amanda! Come on, Amanda!  <br/>Jeff: Amanda throws herself over that net tunnel.  <br/>Come on, Nat. You've got this. Just focus.  <br/>Amanda, switch out that white one.  <br/>Hurry, please!  <br/>Good job, Nat. Bring it home for us.  <br/>Jeff: Both teams think they're close.  <br/>Call it!  <br/>That right?  <br/>Jeff: No, you're wrong. Somebody's got to head out and  figure out what's wrong.  <br/>Take out the first one, the very first boat.  <br/>First boat?  <br/>That one, yeah. And put the one with the light sky. I  think that's it.  <br/>Amanda, comes back.  <br/>Jeff: Orange thinks they have it? it?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: Orange wins reward!  <br/>Jeff: Orange wins reward!  <br/>Jeff: Amanda, Ozzy, Erik, Jason, nice job. You're going on  reward. Alexis, Natalie, Parvati, James, got nothing for you. Grab your  stuff. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. All right,  guys, you are going to board a plane. Fly correctly to Yap. You'll enjoy a  little culture, a little food, get a break away from camp. Congratulations.  Enjoy. Enjoy. Head on out. Head on out.  <br/>This is awesome, guys.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>It was great to get a reward with Ozzy, Erik, and Amanda.  I was really excited. Right now, we're on our way to Yap. I'm sitting here in  the copilot seat. Hopefully I won't have to take over or anything, but, yeah,  I think we're all ready here for a think we're all ready here for a great  adventure. great adventure.  <br/>Yap is a little island nation all by itself in the middle  of the Pacific Ocean. And I've never even heard of Yap, but a lot of people  haven't heard of Hickney where I've grown up, so I kind of relate to grown  up, so I kind of relate to that little tiny country. that little tiny  country.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Hello, and welcome to the village.  <br/>Hello.  <br/>Hello.  <br/>My name is Francis.  <br/>My name is Francis.  <br/>Thank you, thank you. This jungle is very primeval, and  there's little stone walkways that are worn away by thousands of feet that  have walked on them. And in the middle of the jungle, And in the middle of  the jungle, there's a village. there's a village.  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>This village looked out of time. It was almost like this  village had been there for millions of years. I was expecting a dinosaur to  come out of the woods, kind of, [ imitates dinosaur]  <br/>Oh, my god. I can't even believe how much food is on this  table.  <br/>Oh, my god. One of everything.  <br/>I'm, like, in heaven right now, pretty much.  <br/>Isn't this amazing?  <br/>This is beer.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Yes, yes.  <br/>Yes, yes.  <br/>See, that's the tree.  <br/>Oh, they're climbing it!  <br/>Oh, wow.  <br/>Oh, wow. I've never seen anything like this in my  life.  <br/>Yeah, it's incredible. It's absolutely incredible.  <br/>Cheers, you guys. Erik, cheers.  <br/>Give it, give it!  <br/>Oh!  <br/>I thought it interesting that all their women were  topless. I'm sitting there ready to eat my foot food, and the lunch lady  doesn't have a shirt on. Oh, my gosh. It was a little culturally interesting  for me. I mean, it wasn't a huge deal, but that's the most boobs I've  probably seen in my whole life.  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>[ chanting]  <br/>One thing that really fascinated me was the tribal dance.  It was about some legend about their culture.  <br/>[ chanting]  <br/>They had all the kids in their village come, and it was  choreographed beautifully. And I could see that the moms and the dads were  proud of their kids who were doing it, and it was really exciting. It was a  very powerful experience.  <br/>[ chanting]  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Woo!  <br/>Woo!  <br/>That was awesome!  <br/>That was awesome!  <br/>I really love just going places with Erik, because he has  this naive, wide-eyed sense about things. Erik hasn't really traveled around  too many places in the world. So he's really just experiencing all this stuff  for the first time. And the innocence that he has, and the way he really,  like, takes things in, like, wholeheartedly, it was... it's wholeheartedly,  it was... it's wonderful. wonderful. wonderful. Damn it! Damn it!  <br/>The men were chewing the betel nut, which is kind of like  tobaccoish. So I was kind of hanging out with them a lot. They were laughing  at me when I did stupid stuff. But the betel nut, it relaxed me a lot. a lot.  Maybe a little too much. Maybe a little too much. Maybe a little too much. Ah!  Ah! That night, after much betel nut and Micronesian beer, I thought,  "Okay, time to call it a night." And then all of a sudden I had to  rush up, and I pretty much tossed my cookies on the edge of the camp. Oh! Oh!  Damn that betel nut! Damn that betel nut! Oh! Oh! Beer and betel nut, not a  good combination. Woo! What was remarkable about that was that despite the  throwing up, I really don't regret anything. It was all worth it, and I  enjoyed it thoroughly. Damn! I'm going to go eat some more. I'm going to go  eat some more. Oh! Oh!  <br/>It started the most scariest thunder I've ever heard in my  life. Just rained all night. The fire's out. Pretty cold without the fire.  Just not a good night. Just not a good night. Not a good night at all. Not a  good night at all. There's nothing to gain by being on Exile Island. There's  no idol to be found, because Ozzy has it. Ozzy's a huge competitor, and then  to have the idol on top of that, that increased his target, like, tenfold.  Maybe I'll just have to work on getting rid of Ozzy and his getting rid of  Ozzy and his idol. idol.  <br/>The actual gall to get up and tell somebody something, I  mean, and then lay your ass back down, and then lay your ass back down,  that's nerve. that's nerve.  <br/>Hell, yeah.  <br/>Hell, yeah.  <br/>I know.  <br/>I know.  <br/>Hi.  <br/>Tell us about it, Jason. Was it the land of milk and  honey?  <br/>Pretty much.  <br/>Hey, there he is.  <br/>What's wrong with you all?  <br/>What's wrong with you all? You all look hung over. You all  look hung over.  <br/>They had a pig. They had lobsters. They had these mangrove  crabs that had a claw, like, almost the size of my hand. They had these crazy  banana pancakes. Four or five different kinds of chicken. One with a kind of  teriyaki, one was, like, spicy, one was was, like, spicy, one was barbecued.  barbecued.  <br/>He's like... everyone else is downplaying how good the  food is, and he was like, "It was so delicious!" Please, give me  every mouth Please, give me every mouth watering detail. watering  detail.  <br/>She's really close with those girls, isn't she?  <br/>Since she's been back since  <br/>Since she's been back since the swap, we're not so close.  the swap, we're not so close.  <br/>I worry about Parvati. She's put herself into an alliance  with Natalie and Alexis, and I don't know these girls. I don't trust them.  And Ozzy has to be careful, because he is such a threat, and they know he has  the idol. And who's to say who's to flip, And who's to say who's to flip,  who's not to flip? who's not to flip?  <br/>You know, I probably won't be around much longer unless I  continue to win every single continue to win every single individual immunity  challenge. individual immunity challenge.  <br/>Yep. I want to be ready, too. I want to be ready, too.  It'll be life or death for me. It'll be life or death for me. It'll be life  or death for me.  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Cirie, We'll  now bring in Cirie, returning from Exile Island. returning from Exile Island.  All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: First things first. Jason, I'll take back the Jason,  I'll take back the immunity necklace. immunity necklace. Once again, immunity  is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to step up on a  log. You're going to raise your hand above your head. Your hand will be  tethered to a bucket filled with water. When your hand drops, the bucket  tips, you get wet, you're out of the challenge. Last person left standing  wins immunity, is guaranteed a one in eight shot at winning the million  bucks. million bucks. We'll get started. We'll get started. All right,  everybody is tethered in. in. This challenge is officially on. This challenge  is officially on.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>No way!  <br/>This is usury.  <br/>There's food, I'm out.  <br/>Jeff: You guys have been out here a long time without  sugar.  <br/>Ah!  <br/>Jeff: Big bowl of candy if you want to get down and give  up immunity.  <br/>Gummi worms!  <br/>Gummi worms.  <br/>Let's go together. Can we split it, Jeff? Can we split it  if we go together?  <br/>Jeff: If you both go down together, you split it.  <br/>One, two, three.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie and Erik opt out of the challenge for a bowl  of candy.  <br/>Oh, my god! You guys.  <br/>What in the nickelodeon is going on around here? going on  around here?  <br/>I'm sorry, you guys.  <br/>I'm sorry, you guys.  <br/>I'm sorry, you guys.  <br/>Must go to the happy place.  <br/>Must go to the happy place.  <br/>What is it?  <br/>If it's a steak, I quit, but if it's not...  <br/>No!  <br/>You didn't even wait for him to ask.  <br/>Jeff: Alexis got so excited. No, no. I hadn't even said  what it was.  <br/>She doesn't get it?  <br/>No chance. You got excited. You're out.  <br/>âª Dum, dum, dum!  <br/>Alexis, why?  <br/>Jeff: You can mope and be mad. Just so we're clear. If you  want this chocolate chip cookie and milk, you need to let me know.  <br/>Natalie!  <br/>Jeff: Natalie, did you lose your concentration?  <br/>I feel like I'm going to pass out.  <br/>Jeff: Natalie is now out of the challenge.  <br/>Damn!  <br/>Sit down.  <br/>That would suck. Oh, bitch!  <br/>Jeff: Lose your concentration for that long, out of the  challenge. Nobody interested in the chocolate chip cookie and milk? All  right. Four people left-- Parvati, Four people left-- Parvati, Ozzy, Jason,  and Amanda. Ozzy, Jason, and Amanda.  <br/>Jeff: Next item to try and tempt you down.  <br/>It's not that good.  <br/>Jeff: Three chocolate glazed donuts. donuts.  <br/>I'll take it!  <br/>I'll take it!  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy opts out of the challenge for three chocolate  donuts. We're down to three-- Parvati, We're down to three-- Parvati, Jason,  and Amanda. Jason, and Amanda.  <br/>I think I'm done, Jeff. I have to pee.  <br/>Jeff: What's that?  <br/>I think I'm done. I have to go to the bathroom.  <br/>Jeff: Amanda's had enough. You've had enough, pull the  You've had enough, pull the cord. cord.  <br/>Good job.  <br/>Jeff: Amanda off for a bathroom break in the jungle. And  with that, we are down to And with that, we are down to two-- Parvati and  Jason. two-- Parvati and Jason.  <br/>Jeff: All right. You've got a full plate-- three chocolate  chip cookies, four donuts, big, tall jar of candy, peanut butter, two  chocolate bars, milk, two beers, and a huge pizza. If Parvati steps down or  Jason steps down, you and them will share all of this.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>Jason, you can make friends.  <br/>If he took one for the team, we could all very likely say,  "You know what? We're going to spare him for tonight."  <br/>Jeff: Are you saying the group is prepared to tell Jason  they won't vote him out tonight if he'll step down?  <br/>I'd need a guarantee, you know, that I'm not going  home.  <br/>Who do you want a guarantee from?  <br/>Everyone.  <br/>No.  <br/>I won't vote you out, Jason, tonight.  <br/>One.  <br/>I will guarantee. I will guarantee that I won't vote you  out.  <br/>Two.  <br/>I'll guarantee.  <br/>I'll guarantee.  <br/>Jeff: So Parvati's the third.  <br/>Jeff: So Parvati's the third.  <br/>I guarantee I won't vote you out, Jason.  <br/>I guarantee.  <br/>Jeff: Alexis, you won't write his name down either? his  name down either?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I guarantee.  <br/>I'll guarantee.  <br/>I guarantee, too.  <br/>Jeff: You guarantee.  <br/>You just got a guarantee from every person here.  <br/>Jeff: The question is, Jason, do you trust them?  <br/>Yep. I don't know. I'll have to think about that I'll have  to think about that for a moment. for a moment.  <br/>You could turn this into something good.  <br/>Well, either I'm making the biggest mistake of the game  right now, or, you know, it could keep me out here for a could keep me out  here for a little while longer. little while longer.  <br/>Yes. Ow! Oh, my god!  <br/>Jeff: Parvati wins individual immunity.  <br/>High five.  <br/>Good job!  <br/>Jeff: Parvati, congratulations. Individual immunity. You  are the only person safe at tribal council tonight. For the other eight of  you, somebody just made a deal that's going to cost them their spot in this  game. Go and sit on the bench. I'll bring you your food. I'll bring you your  food.  <br/>Yay, food.  <br/>Yay, food.  <br/>Nice work. Could you have stayed up there longer?  longer?  <br/>Probably.  <br/>Probably.  <br/>I spent six and a half hours busting my butt trying to win  that immunity necklace, and to just step down for some food and people's  guarantee that they're going to keep me around, you know, I'm taking a chance  here. It could be my biggest mistake in the game of Survivor,or, you know, it  could be my saving grace.  <br/>Wow!  <br/>I want to thank you guys for making that happen at the  end. making that happen at the end. Thank you so much. Thank you so  much.  <br/>I think one of the dumbest, most naive moves in Survivor  history just got played out. We all guaranteed that we weren't going to vote  for him. But Jason fell for one of the oldest tricks in the book, and oldest  tricks in the book, and he's going to go home. he's going to go home.  <br/>I think six hours up there  <br/>I think six hours up there made him delirious. made him  delirious.  <br/>Damn fool.  <br/>This game is outwit, outplay... outplay...  <br/>Outlast, yeah.  <br/>Outlast, yeah.  <br/>I mean, unless you can think of a better plan. Otherwise  he could still go on immunity rampage.  <br/>I mean, I'm pretty sure  <br/>I mean, I'm pretty sure Cirie's down. Cirie's down.  <br/>We all guaranteed Jason that we wouldn't vote him out  tonight. But I think Ozzy wants to vote him out anyway, which makes this the  perfect time to get rid of Ozzy and that idol, because Ozzy and that idol,  because he'll never see it coming. he'll never see it coming. Ozzy is like a  huge, huge threat in this game. So if Jason, Parvati, Natalie, Alexis, and  myself will vote Ozzy, Ozzy's gone, idol's gone, Ozzy, Ozzy's gone, idol's  gone, clean slate. clean slate.  <br/>I'm just going to stand here for a minute. I think if I  went to the final five with Ozzy, Ozzy would win this game. And I haven't  been here, miserable, going through all this crap to not win this game.  <br/>Seriously, good job, Parvati.  <br/>We'd have to be idiots not to vote him out tonight.  <br/>On the other hand, I made an alliance with Ozzy, and he  protected me in this game a bunch of times. And Amanda has been my best  friend since the beginning of the game. And James has been my guy since day  one. day one. So, god, like, what do I do? So, god, like, what do I do?  <br/>Ozzy was kind of the one in charge, and if he's out, it's  really going to shake things up. But it has to really be kept on the DL,  because if Ozzy gets any sniff of it, he'll use his idol, sniff of it, he'll  use his idol, and that would not be good. and that would not be good.  <br/>Do we have to worry about Parvati, and Natalie, and  Alexis? Alexis?  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>You getting a bad feeling?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Have you talked to her about it?  <br/>No.  <br/>James is worried about Parvati. And this would be a good  moment for someone to try and possibly flush the idol out, but at this point,  I'm pretty confident in my alliance. I mean, hell, this is the reason why  we're favorites. We played this game before. We know that once we decide  something we've just got to go with it. And it's worked out so far, but we'll  see. In the last moment I might just stuff my idol in my bag, and we'll see  what happens at tribal, and I might end up tribal, and I might end up playing  it just to be safe. playing it just to be safe.  <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in your  <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in your jury. jury. Eliza, voted out  at the last Eliza, voted out at the last tribal council. tribal council. All  right, Cirie, tell me about Exile Island. Did you spend any time looking for  the hidden immunity idol?  <br/>I mean, I only had two, maybe three hours of no rain the  whole two days. So knowing that Ozzy already had it, why even bother?  <br/>Jeff: Parvati, is that just a known fact that everyone  believes, which is Ozzy has the idol?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy, does that put a target on your back?  <br/>I mean, of course. I mean, the idol is a huge thing in  this game.  <br/>Jeff: Let's talk about today's challenge-- one of the  craziest things I've ever seen go down. Jason, you made a very risky  move.  <br/>You know, the odds of me continuing to win the immunity  challenges are very slim. So I had to give something else a shot, and it's  really just about crossing my fingers and hoping these people are going to  stick to their word. And I can only hope for the best.  <br/>Jeff: So James, you guys made a deal with the devil, in a  sense. You either stick to that deal and vote one of yourself out or you  renege on that deal and vote the guy out you said you wouldn't vote out.  Either way, the person who gets snuffed goes to the jury. Now they're  frustrated.  <br/>You know, just because you have gotten on everybody's  nerves don't mean a donut is going to make you better. You really can't  expect to appease everybody over a donut. So if you tempt somebody with a  donut, and they say, "Oh, yeah, sure," they might have just wanted  a damn donut.  <br/>Jeff: So Cirie, just because the group gave their word to  Jason doesn't mean the group will keep their word.  <br/>Sounds like that what he said, Jeff.  <br/>Jeff: Parvati, you're sitting pretty tonight. You've got  immunity. What's your take on this whole deal?  <br/>I think it was a crazy deal, but I can kind of understand  why he made the deal. And if it works out for him, then that's great for him.  But if he made this deal and he gets voted out tonight, that's a huge risk  that he took.  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy, if it's true that you have the hidden immunity  idol, does that give you a certain amount of comfort tonight in an uneasy  situation?  <br/>A certain amount of comfort. Even then, it's a risk that I  would have to take after all the votes have been cast. And at that point I've  got to sort of read the group.
