<br/> Jeff: Previously on "Survivor": 20  americans trekked into the wilds of Nicaragua, an untamed land of active  volcanos, dense rain forests and fierce wildlife. <br/>Everywhere you look, there's monkeys hanging  from things. There's Dangerous animals here. It's like-- it's real. <br/>Jeff: They were divided into two tribes-- the  young versus the old. <br/>Oh, man. I was looking forward to some of those young people carrying me. <br/>Jeff: The older tribe immediately fell under  the sway of two-time super bowl-winning coach jimmie johnson. <br/>As long as we're psyched up for it and we know  what we've got to do, we'll kick their ass. <br/>I just got a pep talk from jimmie johnson! <br/>Jeff: On the younger tribe, Shannon decided  that he was the alpha male and immediately formed a strong man alliance with Chase. Without me or you, I think they're screwed. But Chase was also drawn to Brenda. <br/>She's a cute girl. I mean, yeah, I'm attracted to her. I for some reason really trust her. <br/>Jeff: So he got into a second alliance with  her. <br/>Chase, he's a really nice guy. But he's clueless. <br/>Jeff: Meanwhile, Alina and Kelly B. Found a clue to a hidden immunity idol. <br/>We keep it between us. <br/>Jeff: Finding the clue was a stroke of luck  for Kelly B. Because her artificial leg made her a target. <br/>She will definitely beat up with sympathy vote  so she's definitely got to be one of the first ones to go. <br/>Jeff: At the immunity challenge, the older  tribe held the medallion of power which would have given them an advantage in  the competition. If you use it, the medallion goes to the younger tribe and they will have the  opportunity to use it at the next challenge. <br/>We're going to keep it. <br/>Jeff: You're going to not use it. <br/>Don't need it. <br/>Jeff: Unfortunately by not playing the  medallion, the older tribe made a big mistake. Younger tribe wins immunity! Brenda, would you have used that medallion of power in today's challenge? <br/>Definitely, because you're here to win so why  take chances? <br/>Jeff: Back at camp, jimmie johnson decided Wendy  was the weak link. <br/>You ask yourself, does the team get stronger  without Wendy? <br/>Jeff: Jimmy's choice concerned Holly because  she was in an alliance with Wendy. <br/>Feel like I'm really caught in a dilemma  because I shook her hand and gave her my word. <br/>Jeff: But at tribal council, Holly turned her  back on her ally and sided with coach jimmie and rest of the tribe to vote  out Wendy. Wendy, the tribe has spoken. 19 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>I feel like I'm kind of right now on the outs,  and I know my tribe senses I am. I just felt bad about making the alliance with Wendy and then, of course, I  went in with everybody else to vote her out. Tonight's decision was for my team. <br/>No question. <br/>I really liked Wendy. I know it's part of the game to lie, and that's part of the strategy. So I think my next step needs to be to rethink everything. Because I would like to show these people that I can kick their ass on  "Survivor." I don't think I slept a wink. <br/>Really. <br/>That's just not gonna work. <br/>No, you've got to get some sleep. <br/>The plan for today is to get to a better place  with regards to sleep. The shelter's still not totally there. People were up all night. We've got to get that down better. I haven't slept at all. <br/>We've got everybody here, maybe we should have  a group conversation. <br/>Look at rearranging the bamboo and latching it  all up. And putting the bedding. <br/>The morning meeting went pretty good. It seems to be this routine we've fallen into. Everyone sit down and decide what's going on for the day. Coach gave us our assignments for today. <br/>You're going to handle the bamboo. <br/>I'll help on the roof. <br/>Jimmy t. Was helping me on that. <br/>Jane has this good idea of going fishing. <br/>Time out, time out. <br/>Let's stay on track. Hey, jimmy, we hear you. And that's a great idea. That's-- that's a great idea. So on the roof, what were you saying? <br/>Jimmy's the man now, and everybody is buying  in hook, line, and sinker. So now he's going to have td doing this and nobody is saying "Jimmy t. What do you think?" and it's starting to wear on me. <br/>With this here, the knots are going to be a  problem. <br/>Yeah, that might be true. <br/>Jimmy j. Is jumping in and trying to give direction to the whole tribe and I said  let's roll with that. That's fine. Frankly, now I'm putting the pressure on him. I'm not putting my face out there anymore. You're the man. I think I can use that to my advantage in the event we have to vote somebody  else off. <br/>I've never gone so long without showering or  brushing my teeth. <br/>I have. [laughter] So how do you feel about this tribe? <br/>I'm really happy. I know all the guys are really strong. I know you're strong. <br/>Why everybody think I'm strong? <br/>Look at those muscles, girl. <br/>Whatever. But nobody has, like, no guys came and talked to me or approached me or  nothing. I like Sash a whole lot. He's down to earth and he has that million-dollar smile. And it seems like we have a good vibe, a good chemistry. <br/>I'm half black. My dad is from jamaica so I'd love to bring as many minorities to the end as  possible, you know what I mean? <br/>That would be really good. I won't shake your hand but I'll wink at you. <br/>When the time is right, we can try and bring  in Brenda. I think she's the smartest person here and I think she would be a good asset,  you know what I'm saying? Being minorities, we have a bond that no one else can share. If we can work together on this, we could dominate this game. Now it's just up to the asian sensation if she's willing to align with us or  not, so we'll have to see. I think it's important to try and, you know, make friends with as many people  as possible. <br/>Exactly. <br/>Because, you know, it's all a numbers game. <br/>How do you feel about Kelly B.? <br/>Kelly b. Is a big threat because if she can make it all the way to the end, it's a  huge accomplishment. <br/>Right. I've already told myself if there's a challenge where we are going to have  to, like, race, and that leg falls off, she's out of here. For real. Kelly b., she's a charity case. She has the heart, she has the mind, but she doesn't have 100% of the body  and that's going to hurt us. Today, I saw Jill eating snails, and I didn't know if you could eat them or  not. She was going like this... And rolling her eyes, and then that's when I  realized when Jill acted that way, that you really couldn't eat them. <br/>You gotta try these. <br/>That's all right, I'll pass. It's a bad idea. <br/>No. <br/>I'll admit it, it's a bad idea. You honestly think you can eat these things? You guys are stupid. <br/>Are you losing it? Are you having a meltdown? <br/>Why is she getting all mad? <br/>I don't know. <br/>Holly is a very nice person but she's off the  deep end. She needs to do well in this game and she's not and now she's hitting the  panic button. <br/>There was nothing wrong with the snails so I  don't know what to think of Holly. Her mental state is not good, and in "Survivor" you don't want to  come across as mentally unstable. All of a sudden Holly grabbed the pot and, like, took off, and she dumped  them. <br/>Wow. Throwing away food, that's-- And they were huge. And they were good protein. <br/>That's crazy. <br/>They weren't edible? <br/>They were fine. <br/>That's what I thought. <br/>Holly snapped at Jill and it was really kind  of a bizarre type thing. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that she can turn it around before it's  too late. <br/>She's crazy as [ã    \no audioã    ], man. <br/>Huh? <br/>She's crazy as [ã    \no audioã    ]. <br/>I don't think they realized that I was watching  them, and Dan, who is making fun of me, that gets under my skin. So I think the best way for me to handle the situation with Dan is to try to  find a way to release my anger. The new york city boy, Dan, he doesn't like sand on him. So let's just fill his shoes up, and then... Put them somewhere. Make sure they're tied. Take them up here. I'm not going to sit back anymore and let them rub things in my face. I've been too nice up to this point. But the game has just begun. Payback. <br/>My alligator shoes are missing. <br/>Have you looked under? Have you looked under? <br/>Who would take them out of my bag and put them  under here? <br/>Anyone know-- They're not under there. <br/>So I woke up this morning, and I looked in my  bag, and my alligator shoes are missing. <br/>No! <br/>They were in my bag and they're gone. <br/>And they're gone from inside your bag? <br/>Were they expensive? <br/>$1,600. <br/>What? For a pair of shoes? <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>That means somebody here wants to play games. <br/>Too early to start playing games and hiding  stuff. <br/>Right now, I'm struggling emotionally. This game is turning me into somebody I'm not. And it's draining on me, and I'm realizing this might not be for me. I did things that I feel like I shouldn't have and it bothers me so I think  it's best if I come clean. Can we have a tribe meeting? <br/>You have the floor. <br/>I took your shoes out of your bag, filled them  with sand, and I put them in the water. I'm sorry. <br/>She stole my shoes? She stole my shoes. She stole them. I was born and raised in brooklyn, new york. If she were a guy, I would have knocked her right out. It's a good thing you're not a guy. <br/>It's good that the team knows that because... That's why I want you to know. <br/>Holly keeps getting stranger and stranger. And every time she speaks, it becomes more evident that she's crazy. So I'm going to keep one eye on her and one eye on my shoes. <br/>I want to leave this game with honesty and  integrity. <br/>And that's the way you're playing it from here  forward. <br/>100%. <br/>I accept that. <br/>100%. <br/>Wait, wait a minute. It may be easy for you to accept. <br/>Uh-oh! <br/>It may be easy for you to accept. I can't trust her. I don't know how they can but she's not going to get any forgiveness from me. <br/>I am so eaten alive. My legs are out of control. Who moved my socks? Who took it out of my shoe. <br/>I don't know what you're talking about. <br/>I had socks in my shoes, one in each shoe, and  now all of a sudden one's missing. Bitches. <br/>I doubt anybody stole your socks. <br/>Naonka, she lost one of her socks and now she  thinks somebody took her socks and is playing tricks with her, which is crap. <br/>You starting... With my socks or my shoes or  stuff like, it's going to get real dirty. If there is somebody that is either after me, somebody that is trying to  irritate me and they want to play dirty, I can play dirty, too. So I found another pair of socks that were just sitting there, and I took  them. <br/>She took somebody else's socks. <br/>Shows character. <br/>Shows what she really is. <br/>I can't find my spare pair of socks. <br/>Na's wearing them, dummy. <br/>Is she? <br/>Yeah. <br/>That makes me mad. <br/>Laflor is definitely getting into some high  school drama kind of stuff NaOnka swears somebody tried to sabotage her socks  which is crazy, and now she stole Fabio's sock. She's just a loose cannon. <br/>Whatcha looking at me like that for? You ain't got to have no attitude. <br/>I looked at you-- you said why you got look... Why are you raising your voice at me? I can get loud, too. <br/>I was going to ask her do you think you  accidentally took my socks but before I could say anything, she went crazy. You just called me out in the middle... I sure did. I don't know what it is, but Jud, I don't like anything about him. <br/>I need that mask, dude. <br/>I don't want people to think I'm like a  b-I-t-c-h, but the boy is stupid. [laughter] Is my dreadlock okay? <br/>Everybody thinks his jokes is funny. Yeah, we're laughing, heh-heh-heh. I'm laughing because, heh, heh, I'm about to vote you off. <br/>I can't wait for her to go home, man. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm having a hard time. <br/>Yeah, I know. And everybody's concerned, too. <br/>You know, coming into this game, I was like I  can do this. And then you get here and it's the whole mental game, it's totally different. <br/>Right. <br/>I don't know if I can do it. <br/>You can do it for one day, can't you? <br/>I don't know if I can. <br/>It concerns me that Holly is having second  thoughts about the game. She'd like to go home. But, you know, I don't think it's the right thing to do just yet. <br/>I can't do it. I've never failed anything in my life, but I have to be honest. <br/>This is no different than a football player  wanting to quit the team. We all go through some adverse times and, you know, our minds get weak. Vince lombardi says fatigue makes cowards of us all. That's what happens out here. The only thing I ask you to do is give it your best. But we need you. We really do need you. <br/>I know if I quit this game, I'll be letting my  tribe down, so I'm going to keep my head up. I'm going to help the team out, and the emotional meltdown that I had today  might either carry me through or it's going to hurt me. I guess we're just going to have to wait and see. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Halt! <br/>All: La Flora! <br/>Jeff: Younger tribe getting your first look at  the new older tribe. Wendy voted out at the last tribal council. All right, you guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First things first-- Alina, I will take  it back. <br/>Oh, bye-bye. <br/>Jeff: Once again immunity is back up for grabs. Here's how it works. On my "Go," one person from each tribe will race through the mud  and into a stack of hay looking for a ball. Once you have the ball, you'll drop it on your mat, and the next person goes. Once you've collected all four balls, three other tribe members will use  wooden shields to bounce one ball from player to player until it lands in  your barrel. First tribe to get all four balls in their barrel wins immunity and is safe  from the vote. Losers go to tribal council where somebody will be voted out of this game. In addition, today you are playing for reward. And you have a choice. You can choose between a tarp with rope-- I don't care how good your shelter  is, a tarp will make a huge difference. If you don't want a tarp, your other choice is fishing gear-- snorkel, fins,  along with a spear. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Now to the medallion of power, older  tribe, you still have it. If you use it in this challenge your advantage will be you will start with  one ball already in your barrel. That means one less person going through the mud, one less stack of hay to  deal with, and one less ball to bounce from shield to shield into your barrel. It also allows you to sit one weak person out of this challenge. What's the call? Are you going to use it or not? <br/>I think it's pretty significant. <br/>And it's reward and immunity. <br/>Jeff: What's the call going to be? <br/>We're going to use it. <br/>Jeff: You're going to use it. All right, that means the younger tribe will get the chance to use it at the  next challenge. One other order of business-- younger tribe, you have one extra member. You're sitting somebody out of this challenge-- who's it going to be? <br/>I'm sitting out. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka, take a spot on the bench. I'll give you guys a minute to strategize and we'll get started. All right, the older tribe is using the advantage. One part of the advantage is to sit somebody out. Dan is sitting out. The other advantage is you start with one ball already in the barrel. Older tribe has their first ball in the barrel. All right, let's see if the advantage makes a difference. For immunity and reward, Survivors ready? Go! Brenda through the mud quickly. Jimmy johnson through the mud. They're both out at the same time. Both Brenda and jimmy covered in mud, looking for a ball in a stack of hay. Jimmy has the ball for the older tribe! Brenda has the ball for the younger tribe! Go older, go younger. Jane now in the mud for the older tribe. Purple kelly in the mud for the younger tribe. Older tribe with a one-ball advantage. <br/>Right near the bottom, kelly, right near the  bottom. <br/>Jeff: Purple Kelly has it for the younger  tribe. Go, younger tribe! Alina now in the mud for the younger tribe. Jane has the ball for the older tribe. <br/>Go, Alina! <br/>Let's go, Alina. <br/>Jeff: Holly now for the older tribe,  face-first in the mud. Alina not messing around. She has the third ball for the younger tribe. They're making up time. Go! Kelly b. Now on the course. Holly looking for that final ball for the older tribe. Kelly bruno trekking through that mud, artificial leg not bothering her at  all. Kelly looking for that fourth and final ball for the younger tribe. The younger tribe has all four balls. Holly cannot find the ball for the older tribe. Chase unraveling that ball for the younger tribe. You gotta bounce your ball from one shield to another. Holly has the ball for the older tribe. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: The big advantage in this challenge is  that the older tribe only has three balls they need to get in the barrel. The younger tribe has four balls. Benry has a shot for the younger tribe. And he scores. Younger tribe on the board with their first ball. The older tribe lost their advantage. We are now even. Marty to Jimmy T. Jimmy t. To Tyrone. If you drop your ball, it's got to go back to the start. It's all on Benry right now. And he scores again. They now have two balls in their barrel. It takes four to win. Nice bounce and save by Tyrone. Tyrone scores for the older tribe! We are tied, two-two. Benry just short for the younger tribe. Jimmy t. To Tyrone. Tyrone has another shot. This will be the third ball for the older tribe. Tyrone scores again for the older tribe. Older tribe has one ball left. Benry with a shot for the younger tribe. He misses again. The older tribe was given a one-ball advantage, and that is proving to be  huge right now. Fabio to Benry. Benry gotta get one in for the younger tribe. Tyrone could win it for the older tribe. Immunity and reward. <br/>Get in! <br/>Gosh! <br/>Jeff: Tyrone scores and wins for the older  tribe, immunity and reward! <br/>That's what I call kicking ass. <br/>Let's do it, old school! <br/>Old school rules! <br/>We used the medallion of power to get an  advantage, which we desperately needed. Once we saw the advantage that it gave us, and being that it was a dual  challenge, it was a no-brainer. We won, so it really couldn't have gotten better for us. <br/>Jeff: Older tribe, congratulations. [whooping, applause] no tribal council tonight. Nobody going home from the older tribe. Yes, sir. Now, you have a decision-- your choice between two rewards. You have the tarp, or you have fishing gear. <br/>Fishing gear. <br/>Fishing. <br/>Jeff: Come get it. Everything you need to catch fish in there. You can grab your stuff and head on back to camp. Enjoy the night off. <br/>Espada! [ã    \cheersã    ] Jeff: All right, guys. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I will see you tonight at tribal where you will vote out your first member. <br/>We thought being the young guys-- we could  dominate the game from start to finish. So today was a huge shock and a huge disappointment for our tribe, and,  unfortunately, now we have to send someone home tonight, and I'm really not  sure how that's going to play out. [ã    \cheersã    ] We can do it! [whooping] To win the challenge today, I won't lie-- the  first thing I thought of when we won is what if I would have left? It proves that if you don't quit, the payoff will be huge. <br/>Holly-- she seems to be doing extremely well  now. Everybody's got their fingers crossed that she'll get back on the page, but  my past experience with individuals that have had setbacks like that, you  know, it's easier to have the second setback. And so I think it's going to be a continual process with her. <br/>Let's see what's in here? <br/>Let's check out what's in here, guys. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jane, you're going fishing. <br/>Man! <br/>Uh-oh, what have we here? <br/>Instructions? <br/>Oh, boy. <br/>Go. "This is a clue to a hidden immunity idol. "It is up to you whether you share this information with anyone  else." When we opened up our fishing gear, there was  a clue there for a hidden immunity idol. It's a very difficult puzzle, but, I'm a fisherman, so I immediately figured  out the middle one. You know what that is under that top cross, piece of a mast is a yard... Oh,  minus arm, so it's "Yard." 15... It's 15 yards west of the man tree. <br/>15 yards west of the tree man. You know, there's probably, like, a specific tree, like, around... It's 15 yards due west of whatever tree you  think it is. <br/>And west is remotely about that rock. <br/>Initially, we figured out the clue. Said, "Dig 15 feet west of a man in a tree." so everyone just  started frantically digging around random trees, which is, like, exhausting,  you know. So I looked at and looked at it, and I'm like, "Tree man, tree  man." and then it was, like, just hit me. Tree mail. There it is. It's 15 feet west of tree mail. It's tree man, tree mail. Go get it. Marty is a smart guy with good ideas, so I thought it would pay off in the  long run to gain Marty's trust by sharing that with him. <br/>I was really shocked that Jill gave me the key  clue, and Danny was with me when Jill came up, so he's involved now, but I  like him, and I think he could be pivotal. He could be Dangerous later, but I think he could be pivotal if we find that  idol. So, what do you think? Am I in the right area? <br/>25 feet. We got to be right here. <br/>Work with me. <br/>I'm working. <br/>I think the tribe needs a jolt. I think we need a dramatic shift to get people whipped up and in line. <br/>Enough people have seen us here. We got to find this thing. Everybody will be back here digging. We got to find it. <br/>Got to keep digging. We can't give up, I guess. <br/>We I know it's here. <br/>I know we must be close. <br/>It's right here. <br/>Oh! The idol. Jill, I got it it. I got the idol, baby. I got the first... We got the idol. <br/>We got the idol. <br/>Do not forget, we got it. I certainly would not have found the idol if Jill had not given the clue  about tree mail, no doubt about it. Jill, this is so money. So the challenge now is, how do we make it work? <br/>It's not gonna be fun tonight. <br/>I know. <br/>I don't like this. <br/>Blame the medallion. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Blame that one ball. <br/>Right. <br/>It's the best thing we can do. <br/>Right. <br/>Those girls are savage. <br/>They were awesome. <br/>...Worried about, but she dominated it. <br/>We had a good challenge today so that you  could finally show that you're just as athletic as the rest of us. <br/>Today I sat out at the challenge because I  wanted to see if Kelly B. Was going to use her leg as an excuse because it was a physical challenge. I was very proud of her, the fact that she didn't do that. I mean, she's just... She's just awesome. I don't like her, but she's just awesome. <br/>Who are we voting? Nay. <br/>We're either going Brenda or nay. <br/>Well, see that's why it will be easy to get  rid of her later. <br/>Exactly, but I think it should be Brenda now. <br/>I think Brenda definitely has a thing for Chase,  because they hang out a lot. So we're kind of worried about them 'cause he's such a good guy and, you  know, he's going to tell her things. And they might try to work that angle, so we have to break that up. [snorting] Well, I think it's obvious who I want to get  rid of. I want to write down NaOnka, man. <br/>Chase? <br/>Who are you writing down? <br/>Everybody said they're writing down nay. <br/>Why? Seems like you're being a little emotional, doesn't it? <br/>Who do you think would be a better choice? <br/>I think Brenda's gonna be more of a threat. We were just talking about that out there. <br/>Chase is constantly going off on Brenda all  the time. I don't know if he's getting blinded by a woman, but Kelly B. And Alina-- they're kind of nervous, and I'm getting kind of worried about Brenda,  too. <br/>...They're struggling right now. They have three, and they have four with Sash. They need you all two. Why do you think Brenda's clinging to you? She's trying to play your ass, and we're too strong of a tribe to go screw  this all up and go lose to some old asses. <br/>But we got to take Brenda out first. <br/>I hate to put you in that position by voting Brenda  because that's your girl, but... Right. I am definitely in a mess right now. Ever since the beginning of this game, I prayed that God could give me  someone that I could trust, and I feel that Brenda was that person right from  the start. But at the same time, I made an alliance with Shannon. And now he wants Brenda sent home first. So, I'm caught in the middle of two different alliances. And I really have no idea what I'm going to do. <br/>I just want to secure us to go to the final  thing. That's all I want to do. Chase-- he kind of feels bad about sending Brenda home 'cause of her  feelings, blah, blah, blah, blah. But Chase is my number one guy. And if my alliances are doing what they say they're doing, then, Brenda's the  first one to go. <br/>He's talking to everybody telling everybody  off... Yeah. Is he talking to you? <br/>He has not said anything to me. <br/>Is he's talking to me? <br/>Right. <br/>There you go. <br/>Me, too. He's a puppy. <br/>Yeah. <br/>The second person I want is-- what's his nam--  Jude, Jud? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Gone. <br/>I like your list. <br/>Yesterday, I went off on Fabio, and it was  just because he rubbed me the wrong way. I can't stand him. He can't stand me. So, I want Fabio out of here, but he doesn't have to go out, like, tonight,  because he's not a threat to anyone. But Shannon-- he's making himself a threat right now, talking to everybody. And I'm, like, "You want to do that? "Okay, well, just know you have built your own stepping stone to the  grave at tribal council." Sash-- he hasn't talked to you about what he  talked to me about. <br/>Which is what? <br/>He wants to bring all of us minorities to the  end. Did he tell you that? <br/>No. <br/>Yeah. I haven't talked to him about it. <br/>That is his plan. <br/>I like Sash. <br/>You want to know what's funny? I have people on my side without doing anything. I get a good vibe from nay. Sash was saying how he wants to be an alliance. I feel like I can get kelly purple. And I'm really tight with Chase. That makes five. <br/>Chase talks to me, and I feel like he's real. <br/>Yeah: I do feel like he's nervous, though. <br/>I thought he was he was stronger than that. <br/>He's not, and it's a shame because we could  rule this. <br/>Like, do I have your word? <br/>Definitely. <br/>We're taking Shannon out. <br/>That one right there. <br/>Yeah. <br/>They have Shannon, Alina, Fabio, ben, and kb. And they said they want you gone first. I'm so confused right now. Ever since the beginning of this game, I've been trying to figure out who I  can trust and who I can play the game with. I liked Shannon right away, and he wanted to be aligned with me, but now  there's just a feeling that I have that's not right about him. I did not want to play the game this way. I thought I would be able to come in, not talk much... Well, it's obvious that Shannon is the one  calling all the shots, so why wouldn't you just want to take him out first? Why do you need him? Tell me a good reason why you need him. <br/>I don't need him at all. <br/>So, then why would you keep him? <br/>He's the one calling the shots. <br/>Very true, that's right. <br/>He's the one talking and motivating people and  whispering things in their ear. So, I don't understand why you wouldn't take him out first. <br/>Well, we could. Numbers, you, me, um... Purple. <br/>Kelly purple. <br/>Sash? Nay? <br/>And nay. <br/>I really didn't expect someone to come up to  me and say, "Shannon wants you out first." and I don't understand  really why. But Chase-- I think he wants to keep me here because he just trusts me. But it's looking like it will be a tie-- five for me, and five for Shannon--  so who knows what's going to happen? <br/>When I heard their conversation, I was like,  "We're screwed." Brenda convinced Chase to go for Shannon, so Brenda  has him by the cojones, and I don't know what we're going to do. Guys, Chase is with them. <br/>Are you sure about that? <br/>Yeah! Brenda stirred it up. <br/>Brenda stirred it up. <br/>Brenda is so much more of a threat. She has her little charm on him, I'm telling you. <br/>This sucks, man. Nothing is as it seems. <br/>No. <br/>We're still not sure about Chase, man, as  weird as that sounds. And we're wondering if Chase is going to lie to Brenda and vote her out, or  tell the four of us one thing, and then flip. <br/>Chase is with them. If you go first, we're done, all of us. Look how much drama she stirred up in a day. <br/>I know! <br/>You know, it went from us being six strong to,  like, now, I don't know what's what. I don't know who's in my alliance. I don't know who to trust. If Chase is a man of his word, then Brenda will go home tonight. If not, I have a big target on my back. <br/>Somebody will be eating peanut butter and  jelly sandwiches tonight. <br/>Somebody will be. <br/>Jeff: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch and approach a flame. Dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual of tribal council because fire represents your  life. As long as you have fire, you're still in the game. When your fire is gone, so are you. Welcome to tribal council. So, Shannon, how much more difficult has this adventure been than you  anticipated? <br/>Oh, it's been brutal. I mean, I've never been camping a day in my life so this is the worst thing  I've ever done in my life. It's all right. It's gotten better. I'm here. I'll wing it out. But it's been interesting. We've had people, you know, say we're all together, and then I'm coming to  find out there's no loyalty. So we'll see. He better hope his girlfriend stays with him on this tribe tonight because if  not, he'll be going home next. <br/>Jeff: Wow! <br/>He's talking about me. <br/>Jeff: Who's your girlfriend? <br/>I guess-- I guess-- Everybody knows it's Brenda. <br/>She's not my girlfriend. From day one I trusted Brenda and I trusted ben. Those were the two people I trusted the most. <br/>Jeff: Shannon? <br/>Can I say why it's like this? I thought Chase had my back and I thought we were there and we're not not and  it pisses me off. All you had to do was be honest and say you're with her. <br/>I'm coming out with the truth. I've been between two alliances and before we came out here I was very, very  unsure who I wanted to vote for, whether I wanted to vote for Shannon or vote  off Brenda. That's as honest as you can get. <br/>You start off with all your integrity and  loyalty. Where's it been? You've been lying and going both ways. <br/>Jeff: I've got to say, 21 seasons of  "Survivor," never had an opening question open that much whoop-ass  on a tribe ever. <br/>I just want everybody to know how upset I am. Because I gave my word. <br/>Jeff: What's going on over there, Jud? <br/>I'm just trying to tell Shannon to not make  enemies. He just gets aggressive so quick and I'm trying to tell him, that's not  smart, man. <br/>Fabio, home boy is trying to vote me out. I'm not making an enemy. He knows if that doesn't go down tonight he goes next. <br/>Jeff: Brenda, conveniently you are centered in  the middle of this whole thing with Shannon losing his mind behind you. <br/>I think it just shows a certain weakness has  been exposed. It's hard to trust him. <br/>Nobody here trusts you, bud. <br/>Fabio, you don't trust me? <br/>I do, man. <br/>You don't trust me? I told you to vote one way? How about Alina, kb, have I lied to you all? <br/>I trust you. <br/>I'm not lying to anybody. <br/>Jeff: But, Shannon, do you understand why it  might not be the wisest move to throw it all out here before a vote? <br/>I'm the type of person when I am upset and  somebody has betrayed me like that I'll speak my mind and that's what I'm  doing. <br/>You're pretty much digging your own grave. <br/>I'm gonna get this out of the way-- are you  gay? <br/>I'm sure I've had a lot more beautiful  girlfriends than you have, buddy. <br/>You probably haven't, my brother, but good  luck. Trust me, you haven't. <br/>I'm 100%. <br/>Trust me. <br/>I'd like to see you work your magic in new  york. <br/>New york is full of a bunch of gay people. <br/>Jeff: New york is full of gay people. <br/>They got a lot of them, jeff, more than in  louisiana. <br/>Be quiet, dude! We're on the same team for the next two, three weeks. <br/>Jeff: Fabio, get your head out of the trees. This is a tribe completely divided and if experience means anything, it's  gonna be tough sailing for you guys. Alina, is it foolish to believe you can trust somebody six days in of a  million-dollar game. <br/>It's very foolish. I thought I trusted Chase, too. And it's funny everybody is saying Shannon is the one nobody can trust but Shannon  hasn't said a lie to me but Chase has. <br/>Surprised trust is this big of an issue this  fast? <br/>Absolutely. It happened so fast how there was all of a sudden two alliances and you were  either on this side or this side. I don't really know who to trust anymore, either. <br/>Jeff: Brenda, why are you a target? <br/>I'm guessing it's because Shannon wants to  take out a strong girl, but I find it hard to believe he would choose someone  like me because I'm really not, you know, sitting here plotting all day long. <br/>The thing is, jeff, a bunch of people on the  tribe thought she was a threat, not just me. And even today, it was nay. As soon as we got back, and then it changed because we felt Brenda would be  the bigger threat to the other girls in our alliance. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka, is that news to you? <br/>I thought maybe if they were gonna vote me out  it's because I didn't do the challenge today and I was hoping we were going  to win so we wouldn't have to be here because we were strong. We were a unit. <br/>Jeff: You were not tight, NaOnka, and if  you're still thinking you are, you need to get out of the tree Fabio is up in. <br/>Oh, I don't want to be in that tree. <br/>Jeff: So you don't like Fabio? <br/>Nope. <br/>Jeff: What happened to this? <br/>Every time I say something to him he has  something smart to say like I'm dumb. And I'm not afraid to say how I feel about Fabio. Fabio, I don't like you. <br/>Jeff: Okay. Fabio, she don't like you. <br/>That attitude has been present the whole time. And I have tried to keep it cool, but it's obviously hard to do that. <br/>He don't try hard enough. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka, are you a little complicated? Me? No! Am I? <br/>Can we vote? <br/>Can we? <br/>Jeff: Hold on. Kelly b., first big vote. I'm guessing it's going to be a good thing to get rid of somebody. What's the criteria? <br/>Um, I'm kind of wondering what's going to  unify our tribe the most. I think right now what we need is unity as a tribe so we can go back and win  the other challenges, and I think that's how people will vote tonight. <br/>Jeff: All right, you want to vote, we'll vote. Kelly b., you're up. <br/>I guess this is still our game plan? I don't really know. <br/>It was either me or him so this was an easy  vote for me. <br/>You should have known better than to have  messed with the biggest bachelor in new york. As they say in Nicaragua, hasta la vista. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Shannon. Brenda. Shannon. Two votes Shannon, one vote Brenda. Brenda. Tied again, two votes Shannon, two votes Brenda. Shannon. Three vote Shannon, two votes Brenda. Brenda. We're tied, three votes Shannon, three votes Brenda. Shannon. That's four votes Shannon, three votes Brenda. Shannon. That's five votes Shannon, three votes Brenda. Second person voted out of "Survivor: Nicaragua," Shannon. That's six. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Shannon, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Well, it's very clear from tonight's tribal council that the biggest threat  to this tribe is the tribe itself. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next  episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor" La  Flor faces a game-changing decision. Now to the medallion of power. Younger tribe, you gonna use it or not? Coach Jimmy Tries to recruit new players. <br/>What did they say? <br/>They say get your ass out of here. <br/>Jeff: And NaOnka strikes. <br/>What are you doing? <br/>What is that about? <br/>I'll push you so hard that damn leg will fly  off. <br/>My biggest mistake would probably have to be--  I should have gunned for Chase. La flor just got a lot weaker. I mean, it just lost its leg and both its feet. These are a bunch of kids. I should have been with the older tribe, anyway. I been married for 11 years. You can stack 11 years on me so I'm 41 years old. I hope the old people whip up on 'em. I hope they get what they deserve.
