<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: Tom brought in the  big one. [ laughing ]  How did you get it? <br/>I hit it with the machete. <br/>Oh, now, who's the great white shark killer? <br/>And wham! <br/>It's gonna be a lot harder to vote him off now. <br/>Yeah! [ Tom whoops ]  Probst: When tree mail arrived, the tribes learned they  were to build an SOS signal that could be seen from the air. <br/>Little rain...  I say we burn our friggin' shelter. <br/>Probst: Ulong jumped right in, while Koror took a more  methodical approach. <br/>The first thing that we want to do is find the right  location. <br/>Probst: When the plane flew over Ulong, the drop master  was not impressed. <br/>Unless you're flying right over the top, it would be hard  to see. <br/>Probst: And although Koror had trouble with their fire...  Do you have enough information to make a decision? <br/>Yes, I do. <br/>Probst: ...it was their signal that best caught the eye of  the drop master. [ cheering ]  I'm so happy! <br/>In the box was three bottles of red wine...  Cheese tortellini and tomato sauce. <br/>And then we had all of these military food packages that  you could heat up and eat as meals. <br/>To a great tribe. <br/>Probst: At Ulong, the tribe took the loss hard. <br/>We lost the reward challenge because they worked harder. Or I'm sure they worked smarter, knowing them. <br/>Probst: At Koror, Jenn and Gregg's budding romance raised  some red flags. <br/>I'm concerned with Gregg and Jenn. It just could be a monkey wrench that we don't see coming. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, Ulong couldn't get it  together. Ulong may be worse off than when you started. <br/>Back. <br/>Probst: And Coby moved his tribe to another Koror victory. <br/>Left-- empty spot, and I swear we got it. <br/>Probst: And with that, Koror wins immunity for the sixth  straight time. Before Tribal Council, Stephenie feared the worst when Bobby Jon  couldn't commit. <br/>I thought we were sticking together, no matter what. <br/>Well, it's just kind of a toss up, you know? <br/>You're not sticking with your word, then? <br/>I don't really want to talk about it. <br/>I can tell by the way he's acting he's gonna vote for me. <br/>Probst: But the votes came in, and Ibrehem was voted out,  when Bobby Jon honored his arrangement with Stephenie to be the last two  members of Ulong. Ten are left. Ten are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? [ blowing ]  There it goes. <br/>I thank you for keeping your word. <br/>Yeah? <br/>I was a little nervous. I-I knew it was a hard decision for you. <br/>It's over. It's done. There wasn't no good way to do it, you know? <br/>I know. Tonight we went to Tribal Council, and I was really nervous. I really thought I was gonna be the one to go. Bobby Jon, he beat around the bush. He didn't really want to give me an answer on whether he was  going to vote for me or Ibrehem, but luckily he kept his word but luckily he  kept his word and Ibrehem went home. and Ibrehem went home. <br/>Ibrehem and I, we had a friendship, we had a bond, but in  competition you have to rule out feelings, and I just thought Stephenie has  performed better than Ibrehem at challenges, so... I did what was best for  the tribe. <br/>I'm glad that we're still here. I'm still ready to bring home a victory. I think we can do it. <br/>Yeah, I do, too. <br/>It was tough with three, and it's already weird being here  only with two, but I don't feel that my time is up here. I'm still ready to win, and it's clear now that Bobby Jon and I  are the two people are the two people best for the job right now. best for the job right now. best for the job right now. [ buzzing ] [ buzzing ]  Eww! Go! Get out of here! <br/>What's with the rats today? There's like six of them playing in front of the steps. <br/>They're looking for...  Yeah. <br/>Just took them a few days to lose their fear. The rats, they're going crazy today. I don't know if, uh, if we've gotten sloppy with food or we're  cutting the coconuts too close to the camp or... I just think it's that the  rats have got comfortable with us and realize that we're not a threat to  them. <br/>The rats have become bolder and bolder, and it's all our  tribe's fault because nobody will listen to me. There's coconut everywhere, so of course the rats are going to  become more and more bold. They're eating our coconut, which is all over the camp because  people won't clean up. So every bit of rat that we get So every bit of rat that we get  all over us is deserved. all over us is deserved. <br/>You are? <br/>Uh, I'm not smelling it anymore. I've told people for days. I have told Tom every day since he caught that shark to move his  damn shark head, because it stinks, there's flies everywhere. It's not even 20 feet from our camp. So I got up this morning, I moved the shark head, I moved the  guts because nobody was doing anything, as usual. I'm the one who has to get the firewood, I'm the one who has to  keep the fire going, I'm the one whoa has to boil the water. I'm the one who has to go hunt food. Those girls don't do anything, especially Jennifer, Katie and  Janu. Katie and Jennifer don't do anything all day long. I've never seen them touch a piece of wood since we've been  here, and now Janu is on her eighth straight day of, "Boo-hoo! I want to go home." Would you quit already? Get out of the game. You know, I'm too much of a feminist to watch this happen. These Alpha males are just totally waiting on them hand and  foot, and the girls are loving it. They're eating it up. It's making me sick. I want to take all three of those girls and push them in that  fire. [ sighs ]: Oh...  Come on in, Koror. We'll now bring in Ulong. Ibrehem voted out at the last Tribal Council. <br/>Hi. <br/>Probst: You're only two, but you're still a tribe. <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: Okay, let's get to today's challenge. It is going to require an adventurous spirit, a willingness to  try something new and an overall open attitude toward life. It is a food challenge. The food you're going to be eating is a delicacy. It's also very nutritious. It's from this part of the world, and it's called balute. Balute is a fertilized egg that contains partially-formed  duckling. These ducks are about 20 days old. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Probst: You can see the beak... and it is full of protein. Here's how it'll work. We're gonna go in rounds. Each round, we will increase the number of balute you eat. In the first round you'll eat one balute, then two balute, then  three balute and finally four balute. There will be four rounds. Each time you get it down, you score a point for your tribe. At the end of four rounds, whoever has the most points wins  reward. Makes sense? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Probst: Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: I know you both have showers. What you don't have for those showers is fresh water. First part of your reward, 55 gallons of fresh water in a tank  with a showerhead delivered to your camp. That's water you don't have to find, water you don't have to  bring back, water you don't have to boil. To go along with that, because, trust me, you guys reek... [  laughing ] ...a little luxury gift bag here. <br/>Wow. [ cheering ] Everything you need to get clean, get that taste  out of your mouth, get that smell off your body. Do not underestimate how revitalizing that can be to get clean  again. That's what you're playing for. Koror, because you have six extra members now, you're sitting  six people out. Just tell me the two that are going to compete. Ian... and Tom. It'll be Ian and Tom versus Steph and Bobby Jon. Everybody else, take a spot on the bench. Round one, come on up. This is not a race. This is just get it down. Here's how you know when you're finished. Show me an empty mouth. I'll say you're good. Once I say you're good, if it comes back up, it's fine. Balute is served. <br/>Oh. <br/>Probst: Survivors ready? <br/>Ready. <br/>Ready. <br/>Probst: Eat. <br/>How's it, Tom? <br/>Probst: Bites right in. <br/>Come on, Tom, it's beer. <br/>Probst: So does Steph. <br/>Down. <br/>Probst: Tom's clean. He's good. <br/>Give me a wink, Tom. Come on, show me something. All right. <br/>Probst: That's good. Koror and Ulong both score. We're tied one-one after the first round. <br/>Watch the beak. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Next two, come on up. <br/>"Watch the beak."  Probst: Survivors ready? Eat. <br/>Mmm! That was a juicy one. <br/>Echh. [ Ian chuckles ]  Oh... Umm... What's going through your head, Ian? <br/>There was some egg shell in that one. <br/>Probst: Sure that was what was the crunchy part? <br/>I don't know. <br/>I don't either. <br/>But I need the soap. <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon, we got a little piece right there on  the plate. Let me see that thing. That'll work. All right. That'll work. <br/>All right, Ian. <br/>Good job, Ian. <br/>Probst: We're good after two rounds. Tom and Steph, we are tied at two-two. You now have three balute to get down. to get down. Survivors ready... and eat. Survivors ready... and eat. <br/>Probst: Thinking at all about what you're eating, Steph? <br/>Eggs. <br/>Probst: Eggs. It's just eggs. <br/>Just don't look at it. <br/>I got a chirp out of that one. <br/>Mmm. Mmm. <br/>Probst: Tom has three down. He's clearing that mouth. That's good. <br/>Damn, Tom. <br/>Hungry. <br/>I can feel the feet a little, too-- they scratch. <br/>Probst: That looks good. Tom and Steph-- they've downed three balute. We are tied three-three, moving into the last round. Ian, Bobby Jon, four balute waiting for you. Survivors ready... eat. <br/>Come on, Ian. <br/>Good job, I. <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon not messing around. He's almost done. <br/>Come on, I. <br/>Come on, I. Just keep...  It's all right, I. Get it down. <br/>Probst: Open that mouth, brother. That's good. Ian gets down all four just like that. Head back. We are tied four-four. <br/>Probst: Okay, moving into a tiebreaker. You'll pick your strongest person. You'll eat five balute. It's a time trial. First one to get five down wins reward. <br/>I was hoping for a few more of these. <br/>Probst: Who's it going to be for Koror? <br/>It's going to be Tom. <br/>Probst: Tom's going to take the five. <br/>Got it. <br/>Probst: And Bobby Jon. Come on up. <br/>Come on, Tom. <br/>Attaboy, Tom. Come on. <br/>Probst: At stake: 55 gallons of fresh water. That is a lot of water. Plus everything you need to get clean-- get this taste out of  your mouth. First one to get all five down, show me an empty mouth, wins  reward. Survivors ready... eat. Bobby Jon two-fisting it. <br/>Good job. Good job. <br/>Probst: Tom trying, taking nibbles from both. <br/>Come on, now. <br/>Probst: Gonna come down to an empty mouth. <br/>Guiness, Guiness. <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon shoving that fifth one in there. <br/>Get it down, Tom! <br/>Probst: Keep it in there. Keep it over the plate. <br/>You can do it, Tom. Mind over matter, fireman. <br/>You got it, Tom. <br/>Nice job. Nice job. Nice job, Tom. <br/>Come on, Tom. You got it, Tom. Come on, now. <br/>Probst: Tom's got his fifth one in his mouth, but he's got  to get it down. <br/>Nice work, Tom. <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon trying to shove it down. <br/>Come on, Tom. Koror! You got it, Tom. [ clapping ]  Think about how dirty I am now, come on. <br/>You can do it, Tom. Show him that mouth. <br/>Come on, Tom. <br/>Just swallow, Tom. Hurry, before him. <br/>Bobby Jon's getting it. <br/>Hurry! <br/>Swallow. Swallow. Swallow it, Bobby Jon. <br/>He's almost there. Come on. <br/>Probst: Tom very close. [ Bobby Jon retching ] Tom's got it for Koror! [ groans ] [ groans ] [ cheering ] [ cheering ] Might as well  finish it. Right, Bobby Jon? <br/>Good job. <br/>Probst: Tom? Rinse that out of your mouth. A little Scope will make that taste go away, huh? <br/>Hook a brother up, will you? <br/>This tastes good enough to drink. <br/>Probst: This challenge is over for Ulong. Grab your stuff, head on back to camp, guys. <br/>Man, I almost had him. <br/>Probst: Koror, 55 gallons of fresh water in a tank, with a  showerhead, will be delivered to your camp. You can take this back with you. Congratulations. <br/>That's the soap. I'm getting the dirt off! [ cheering ] [ cheering ]  All right! <br/>All right! <br/>Whoo! <br/>The challenge today was for a reward. We got 55 gallons of water, which is great, and we won a basket  of shampoo and conditioner and toothpaste and toothbrushes. <br/>Cheers. <br/>I'd say I'm a big fan of the Scope mouthwash. I particularly like the Citrus Splash. Tastes a little bit like oranges. [ chuckling ]  We all took a swig, and just... it felt so good 'cause it  was just tingling. It was wonderful. <br/>Did y'all want to come see what you won back here? New water thing. <br/>Seeing the big drum up there... Oh! We have a shower. I was looking forward to feeling human for one day. You think you should use all that for showers? Given that we're all still drinking poisoned water. <br/>We should use none of it for showers. <br/>I agree. <br/>&gt; I think we should take off that showerhead and fill  canteens right out of that spigot. <br/>I think most people want a shower, though. Don't you? <br/>Let's see how much is over there. <br/>Can we just have one shower, and then...  We can, but we're still in a survival situation here. Jenn was crestfallen that she wasn't going to get in. I had to assert myself, and it's something I've been trying not  to do. But there were people within the tribe who actually thought that  the first fresh water that we've seen in 19 days should actually be used for  shower purposes. It's ridiculous. <br/>What do you think, Jenn? <br/>Jenn wants a shower. <br/>Everybody takes a shower, we're down to two-thirds. I agree. <br/>Tom is the one who spoke up. "Well, I think we need to, uh, conserve, you know, and use  that water for drinking." And it's 55 gallons of water! I mean, come on. You can't let us use, like, a gallon or two? <br/>I vote for not using the fresh water, but like, I know  there's some people who really want a shower and really want that comfort,  so...  No, it's all right. <br/>Nobody wants to speak up, and I'm not going to be that  person. I could see that coming back to haunt me. "Oh, Jenn really wanted to use, you know, the clean water  for her bath."  So we're okay? Everybody's good with the decision? <br/>Everyone's good, or...? <br/>Yeah. Yeah, makes sense. <br/>He really is not letting it be a vote. Maybe, in the end, that'll make him be voted off, you know, for  being such a sourpuss for being such a sourpuss about the whole thing. about the whole thing. <br/>You see how much of that stuff I had left in my hand? Okay? <br/>Yeah, I know. It's always like that. It's, like, we're there, but we miss it by, like, an inch. <br/>Today's defeat is heartbreaking. I mean, I had my throat open as much as I could, shoving it in  there, but Tom, he shoved his in faster. Well, I'm getting tired of losing to him, you know? <br/>Right. For some reason, you keep matching up against him. Well, you're the strongest on our tribe, and he's the strongest  on theirs. That's why. <br/>I feel like I can beat anybody else on that tribe. <br/>I know. <br/>If you want to know the truth. <br/>I know you can. That's why you're not going up against anybody else. You're going up against him. <br/>It just seems like Tom beats me every single time, and  that's something that's getting real, real old, so I'm real pissed right now. I mean, I see fire. <br/>Bobby Jon? I think he's been too positive about the losses. He's, like, "It's okay. We lost again. We'll get them next time." But he's starting to get  frustrated. I don't know. I guess guys need to throw things, punch things, make noise--  whatever they can to feel manly when they're pissed off. But, half the time, But, half the time, he scares me. he scares me. Bobby Jon is sick of losing, and I think he's finally, finally  starting to take it to heart. So, I was actually happy So, I was actually happy to see him mad  like that. to see him mad like that. <br/>Being undefeated is glorious, but it's a lot of days of  monotony. We've been with the same people for many days now, but things  are going to change real quick around here. No more Happy Koror Day. No more... [ cheering ] It's going to be... [ growls ]... [  growls ]... eating each other. eating each other. <br/>If they turn, then they need to be broken up. Gregg and Jenn-- they're part of the alliance. But I'm still worried about them switching over and trying to  pick Tom and I off. They're two votes strong. That makes it a threat. I think they're definitely using their relationship for  strategic advantage, so we know, going into it, you know, that we're going to  need to take one of them out eventually. We're all family, but there's a business side to it, too, so we  are on the verge of utter ridiculousness, for sure, and I can't wait. <br/>Well, listen, we got good news. Stephenie's still there...  We really need... we're gonna need...  We needed that. We have to keep that quiet here. You can't slip in front of Gregg, you know, and Jenn, 'cause  just... 'cause we are all together. You got to keep that quiet. Katie and Ian and I hooked up on day two, and said let's see how  far we can take this. And Stephenie also was part of that group. Except for myself, Ian and Katie, nobody even knows that there  is a relationship that Stephenie would be the wolf in the sheep's clothing  that they wouldn't even see coming. <br/>Final four is me, you, Stephenie and-and Katie. you, Stephenie and-and Katie. <br/>Right. <br/>Right. [ grunts ]  You all right? <br/>Yeah. I just make noises. I feel like if I scream at it that, uh...  My boyfriend does that, and I want to friggin' kill him. <br/>Really? <br/>It's hard being here with just Bobby Jon. Sometimes I don't know what to say to him, you know? It's just the two of us left. We don't have a lot in common. It's just tough. [ Bobby Jon burps ] Bobby Jon is totally turning into a caveman. [ blowing gourd ] I mean, I'm not going to lie. Like, I am disgusting, but I scrub so much with that sand-- my  armpits, and my whole body-- that I really don't think I smell that bad. But Bobby Jon? He's just gross. He is always dirty. Always. [ crunching ] And then he eats everything and anything. Like, today, we caught a crab. And he's eating the whole thing, and I'm, like, you know, you're  supposed to eat the white meat inside. Not the shell. Oh, man...  I know that's gross. <br/>Snot rocket. <br/>I'm sorry. I got to do it. <br/>Occasionally, I will turn around and see him blowing a  snot rocket straight out directly in the middle of where we sleep. He does apologize, but, um... it's nasty. It's hard, 'cause I-I think about Koror all the time, and I know  that they are just, like, living the life over there. They're having the time of their life, and here me and Bobby Jon  are, you know, busting our butts to try to keep the fire in the cave going. I thought this was going to be a piece of cake. I could do this. It's totally me. I'm totally cut out for this. And I am. And I still believe that. But it's tough. Damn! <br/>Got to let it down. <br/>Holy crap! Oh, man, need help? [ grunts ]  Just getting that outrigger into the water damn near  killed us. Good job. <br/>One, two, three. [ grunting ] [ loud grunting ]  Rest. <br/>If I make it through this, I can make it through anything. [ grunting ] I mean, it's tough physically, it's tough mentally,  it's tough emotionally. It's hard, it's like we're halfway through, but we have so long  to go. [ voice breaking ]: And... I'm trying to be so strong and it's  like, you can only do so much work. And it's hard, it's like, you're out here with no one. And it is really hard. I won't give up hope, but I feel like we're at, but I feel like  we're at, like, a dead end. like, a dead end. <br/>We are really kind of down right now 'cause we're really  tired and we're really hungry, but we're just going to keep trying and  trying. You know, we don't give up, and I-I value that. <br/>I got one. I got one! <br/>Wow! Good job! <br/>A school of needlefish swam up, and I just shot right in  the middle of them and happened to get one. So I kind of felt like, you know, like I'd accomplished  something. Golly, the meat! [ whistles ]  That's going to be a lot to eat tonight. Oh, my God. <br/>How good is it? <br/>Oh, my God. This is so good. There's so much meat. The fish that we had, it was like the best thing I ever had in  my life. You can feel the protein going into your body. <br/>This is the breakfast of champions. <br/>We are having a feast. It's been 21 days and we've barely had any fish, so it was a  really nice treat to have that. And that's all we needed And that's all we needed to really get  our spirits up. to really get our spirits up. <br/>Puzzle. <br/>"Sink or swim."  "Sink or swim. Think and swim."  "Today they mean the same. For the tribe who can't do either, one more will leave the  game."  It's imperative we win today, because it's for immunity,  and if we lose, there will be no more Ulong. It's pretty much do or die. <br/>It really is. <br/>We're pretty tough competitors, so I think today immunity  is going to be Ulong's, finally, 'cause I'm pretty good 'cause I'm pretty  good at this stuff. at this stuff. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>We are. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Probst: First things first. Janu has it today. Immunity once again back up for grabs. Ulong, that means anyone can win. Okay, for today's challenge, you're going to swim out to a  series of pontoons. Underneath the pontoons there's a rope that leads to four bags  of puzzle pieces spaced out along the course. First person will swim out, pull yourself along the rope to the  first bag of puzzle pieces and unclip the bag. You'll then hop up on the pontoon, cross the balance beam come  back to the start. Then the next person will go out to collect the second bag. You will alternate until you have all four bags. Once you have all four bags of puzzle pieces, open them up,  start putting together a word scramble puzzle. Once you have the puzzle put together, start circling the words  that are on your puzzle board. Any time two words intersect, take that intersecting letter and  write it on a letter cube. When you've found all the words, take the intersecting letters,  use them to form a three-word phrase. That phrase holds the key to immunity. Koror, you're only running two members. The only people who cannot participate are the people who  participated yesterday, that's Ian and Tom. Who are the two today? <br/>Me and Coby. <br/>Probst: Coby and Gregg. All right, everybody else take a spot on the bench. take a spot on the bench. Wait for my "go." Wait for my "go." Here we  go, for immunity. Survivors ready... go! Gregg and Steph into the water first. Pull yourself underwater looking for a bag of puzzle pieces. Steph gets to the pontoon first. Steph gets to the pontoon first. Gregg right behind. Gregg right behind. <br/>Come on, Steph. <br/>Probst: Gregg and Steph both up with their puzzle pieces. Puzzle pieces are not light. Working the balance beam. Gregg with a bit of a lead. Steph right behind. <br/>All right, Gregg. Looking good. <br/>Probst: Gregg's back. Coby heading out. Steph back, Bobby Jon heading out. Bobby Jon trying to make up some ground almost walked on water. <br/>Let's go! <br/>Probst: Coby trying to find the puzzle pieces. Bobby Jon making up some ground. Coby's got them, he's up. [ applause ] Bobby Jon's got his, he's up. We're dead even. <br/>Good job! <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon is taking the lead for Ulong. <br/>You got it, Bobby Jon! <br/>Bring it in, Cobe! <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon heading back with the second bag of  puzzle pieces. Steph heading back out for Ulong. Gregg heading back out Gregg heading back out for Koror. for Koror. Steph has the third bag for Ulong. <br/>There you go, Steph, take your time, baby, come on! <br/>Probst: Gregg has the third bag for Koror. Steph-- no trouble with the balance beams, making short order of  it. <br/>All right, Gregg! <br/>Probst: Ulong with their third bag-- one more to go. Bobby Jon heads out looking for that last bag. He's got a big lead. Coby heads out, lot of ground Coby heads out, lot of ground to  make up for Koror. to make up for Koror. Coby's making up some ground, closing that gap. <br/>Whoo! [ panting ]  Bobby Jon! <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon struggling to get that last bag. Bobby Jon has it for Ulong. Coby has it for Koror. We're dead even. <br/>Good job, Coby. <br/>Good job, Coby. <br/>Yeah, Coby. <br/>Yeah, Coby. <br/>Push, push, push! <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon is back. Start opening. Coby is back, now moving on to the puzzle phase of this  challenge. It is anybody's game. Koror going right to work on the puzzle board. <br/>Come on, bring it up there. <br/>Probst: Koror making  Probst: Koror making progress. progress. Koror has their puzzle together. They are going to start solving the word scramble. <br/>It's not there. <br/>This has got to be it. The one we had before. Are we missing a piece? <br/>Probst: Ulong struggling to get the puzzle together. Koror is already finding words. Ulong has solved their puzzle. <br/>Go, start going. <br/>Probst: Koror has all of their words, they are now looking  for a three-word phrase. Steph not embarrassed to just look next door. <br/>Hell, no, not now. <br/>Probst: Coby going to cover it up now. Ulong not quitting. <br/>Right here. <br/>This is wrong. <br/>Jeff. <br/>Probst: Koror thinks they have it. "Victory at sea." Koror is right. Koror wins immunity again. [ cheering ]  Awesome! Koror, once again immunity is going back to camp. Gregg. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Probst: Ulong, I wish I had better news. Tribal Council tonight, because there are only two of you, there  will be no vote. There will be an individual immunity challenge. Loser goes home. <br/>Whoa. <br/>Probst: Grab your stuff. <br/>Probst: Grab your stuff. I'll see you at Tribal. I'll see you at Tribal. <br/>Nice job! <br/>Yay! <br/>Clean sweep. <br/>Way to rock it out, guys. <br/>A lot of effort. <br/>We won another immunity, which means that we've won every  single immunity. It's mind-boggling. I never fathomed coming into this game I would be on a team this  strong. <br/>I loved that we started out, it was like, the three oldest  people, the gay guy...  The skinny, gangly guy...  The tall, skinny guy, the dancer...  The skinny showgirl. <br/>You know? <br/>We were absolutely the underdogs. We were silly and goofy and kind of quirky-looking, and I cannot  believe we won immunity every single time. <br/>We all made the jury. Isn't that crazy? <br/>It's a good thing. <br/>Today meant a lot because my whole life I've wanted to be  part of a team. Because, you know, when I was a kid, the jocks would make fun of  me, I'd quit, I'd run off crying. That was one of the reasons I came here. <br/>Good job, Coby. <br/>You know what? Every time we've done a physical challenge, you've stepped up,  man. Like, you've been very physical. <br/>Don't make me cry. I never got to be part of a team,much less a winning team. As a kid I never played sports. I was always called the girly guy, you know, I was the sissy. People would pick on me, and I would just give up. I ended up quitting school because people made fun of me. [ voice breaking ]: I've given [ voice breaking ]: I've given up  a lot in my life. up a lot in my life. But I wasn't going to let anybody make me quit this time, no  matter how hard it is. So nobody was gonna, nobody was gonna take this away from me,  and that's why I've worked so hard. I've worked so hard. 'Cause I'm not quitting. 'Cause I'm not quitting. <br/>Well, we didn't get immunity. The final challenge. Today we lost our last shot at immunity. We had a great lead. We just suck at puzzles. And it's, like, what can we do? It's over now. <br/>You know, we've tried to prepare, we've tried to  strategize, we've tried this, tried... nothing has worked for this tribe-- I  mean, nothing. In a way I feel like, you know, I lost the thing today, you  know? I felt like I was focused. I felt like Stephenie was focused. I thought we were gonna win. I don't know. I've done all the grunting and getting and going and climbing  and swinging from vines and all that that I can do, and now it's gonna be  between she and I. I don't want to go home-- I'm gonna feel like a failure if I go  home right now. You know how bad I'll feel? <br/>That's what I said, that's what I said. <br/>Like, you know, like...  To not win one immunity? I know. Tonight we will go to Tribal Council, and there will be an  individual immunity up for grabs, some sort of challenge, and we're gonna  compete against one another against one another to see who stays in the game. to see who stays in the game. <br/>There we go. There we go. Damn. You always get it started. You think, like, tonight whoever stays will come back here by  themself? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>It's kind of scary, because I don't know what's gonna  happen. Like, Ulong will then be down to one remaining member, and I guess  that person will come back here by themselves? It's gonna be tough, just one person trying to do fire, water,  go fishing. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It was scary just coming back here with Bobby Jon, but at  least I knew I had him, because he does a lot of the work around camp that I  can't do. So if I'm here by myself, that will be really scary. <br/>It's gonna be weird. <br/>I know. [ laughs ]  There may never be a merge, and it may just keep on going  one at a time, and if it does, then I'm prepared for it. I'm good at getting fire, I know where every coconut tree is, I  know where every little fishing hole is, so I can stay out here for weeks by  myself. <br/>It's tough because we were teammates all along, and now  we're competing against one another. So it's do or die. If I don't win tonight, I'm out of the game completely. If I win tonight, there is a whole variety of things that could  happen. Hey, we need to talk 'cause I, like, have no idea what the hell  this immunity thing could be. It's definitely a challenge, but what kind, do you think? <br/>Stephenie thinks nonstop. I think she even thinks when she sleeps. So she's thinking right now. "How am I gonna kick Bobby Jon's ass?" That's just how  she is, and when it comes down to being, you know, bad-ass to bad-ass,  I'll-I'll get... I'll get just as bad-ass with anybody. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>All right. <br/>I been doing this little team thing, and that's fine and  cute, and I enjoy it and it's great. But I'm kind of getting tired of the team thing. It's done, you know? This is team Bobby Jon This is team Bobby Jon right now. right now. <br/>Probst: So, what's it like being a tribe of two? This is new. Steph, what was it like today? <br/>Um, just enjoyed our time together and just talked, and,  you know, we both think that the strongest members of Ulong remaining, and  whoever wins tonight deserves to be here. <br/>Probst: Was today a little bit bittersweet? It's almost like you're the final two, but we're barely halfway  into this game. <br/>You know, it's, like, oh, we're the last two, but, you  know, we've only knocked, like, one little notch out of the game. There's, like, so many things left to do. You got to go all the way, and, you know, half's nothing. <br/>Probst: Has there been a highlight for you in these first  21 days, Bobby Jon? <br/>I think today was, to be honest with you. Catching, like, fish and, like, having success, you really learn  that, you know, hey, you know, you can get by, and you can live off, you  know, Mother Nature. <br/>Probst: Steph, how do you feel about your ability to  survive? Have you learned a few things? <br/>I have. I learned a lot from Bobby Jon, actually. Still not so good at spearing fish, but... uh, I know how  to...  She can get coconuts,  ...coconuts...  ...she can get crabs, and she can start a fire. <br/>I don't know how good myself, but...  She can do anything a man can do,I'll tell you that. <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon, what would you say after 21 days is the  key to survival? What have you learned that's most important? <br/>Fire. Fire. Definitely fire. <br/>Probst: Ability to make it? Keep it going? <br/>Both. <br/>Ability it make it and keep it going. You know, we came in today and it was out, and we had to restart  it. You know, we just kind of looked at each other like, oh, no,  here we go again. This could take an hour or longer. <br/>Probst: So, Steph, would you agree with Bobby Jon-- is  fire most essential? I'm, like, frantic without fire. Absolutely. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to your immunity challenge. You want to know what it is? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: It shouldn't surprise you. It is the key to survival: the ability to make fire. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: You're both gonna have 25 matches. You will have a box of kindling and coconut husk. The first person to build a fire with a flame high enough to  light their torch wins immunity, stays in the game. Loser... goes home. Both feel confident in your fire-making skills? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm not that good. <br/>Probst: All right, take a spot over there, and we'll get  started. started. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Probst: Here we go. Survivors ready. Begin. Bobby Jon going right for the coconut husk. They each have the same box of kindling and coconut husk. And the same amount of matches. And Steph going And Steph going for the coconut husk. for the coconut husk. Bobby Jon has fire first. Steph right behind. Steph blowing on it. That's using your brains. That's using your brains. Steph has a big flame. Steph has a big flame. Bobby Jon trying to keep up. Steph has a big flame. Steph's torch is lit! Just like that, this challenge is over. Steph wins immunity. Bobby Jon, I'm sorry, for you it's over. Steph, go ahead and have a seat back on the bench. Bobby Jon, you need to get your torch. <br/>Hey, good luck. <br/>You, too. <br/>You, too. <br/>Thank you. See ya. <br/>Thank you. See ya. <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon, the tribe definitely did not speak  tonight. Nonetheless, it's time for you to go. So long. So long. <br/>Thank you, sir. <br/>Thank you, sir. <br/>Oh, my God. This is crazy. <br/>Probst: It's just you. <br/>It's just me now. <br/>Probst: What do you think tonight's gonna be like? <br/>It's gonna be scary. I mean, I left camp with the fire pretty stoked and, uh, my bed  already made, in case I was coming back to it, and lots of firewood. So I'm kind of scared. Hopefully, I'll have a good night, and tomorrow, God knows what  that brings. <br/>Probst: We'll see what tomorrow brings. Grab your torch, head on back to camp. head on back to camp. You're still alive. You're still alive. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:  The three of us'll go? <br/>Probst: Tom offends Coby. <br/>I'll be left out again, as usual. <br/>Coby... Coby...  Hello? I'm still here. I'm still trying to participate, you jerks. <br/>Probst: And Stephenie struggles alone at Ulong. <br/>This is scary as hell. This is the scariest thing, and the hardest thing and the  hardest thing that I'll ever do. that I'll ever do. <br/>I feel like a brand-new man, I really do. I wish I could keep going-- I have a lot left in me-- but  hopefully, I can turn that energy and that attitude to something positive  from here on out. I'm definitely proud of Stephenie, 'cause I think she's honestly  probably the top player in the game. I would just tell Stephenie just keep on doing what she's  doing-- I mean, what she's doing-- I mean, the girl's almost invincible.
