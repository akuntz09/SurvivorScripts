<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor,the three remaining members  of Barramundi bid farewell to the outback. <br/>Tina: I don't know why saying good-bye is so hard. <br/>Colby: We've been out here for 42 days. It's made us realize what we take for granted at home. <br/>Keith: This really is not about the money, and it's  totally fine with me. <br/>Jeff: Colby won the final immunity challenge and surprised  everyone by voting Keith out instead of Tina. <br/>Colby: I don't even know that I have a 50-50 shot against  Tina. <br/>Jeff: The two of them faced the jury, and in a final twist  the votes were revealed live in Los Angeles. Tina was the ultimate survivor. <br/>Colby: Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Tonight, the final adventure into the private lives  of 16 survivors, back from the outback. [ Survivor theme playing]  Jeff: The game is over, and 16 lives have been changed  forever. Tonight, we're going to take you where you haven't been, inside  the homes and hearts of 16 ordinary people now living extraordinary lives. <br/>Tina: It's not just children who have dreams. Adults have dreams, too. <br/>Jeff: We'll learn who found love...  Elisabeth: He just kind of, like, got down on one knee and  took out this box, and I'm screaming, and I was like, "Oh, my gosh, this  is happening."  Jeff: ...who didn't...  Jerri: Knowing him now, I'd have to say, no way in hell. <br/>Jeff: ...who is searching for answers...  I asked God why? Why would he do something like that? <br/>Jeff: ...who is searching for peace...  Debb: If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't do it  all over again. <br/>Jeff: ...and some surprising spin from last year's  survivors. <br/>I was in love with Colby. He would play Jerri like a violin. <br/>Jeff: Every player has a different take on the Survivor  experience. We begin with two who want to set the record straight: one who  wants to put it all behind her, and one who is just loving life and living  like mad. [ Digeridoo music plays] [ phone rings]  [ over answering machine]: I'm probably outback, but I'll  be happy to "koala" you later. <br/>Maralyn: Since I've been back from the outback, same old  farm, same old Maralyn, same old mad dog. I keep telling you, nothing's really changed. I went from basically your average street cop to the outback on  the number one show in America. How bizarre is that? But some things don't change. I still have to muck out my own donkey stall. This was then. <br/>AMBER LANIER: She's still my sister. But she is a different mad dog. <br/>Maralyn: This is now. <br/>AMBER LANIER: She is out there. Um... very much out there. <br/>Maralyn: I've lost a total of 20 pounds. I've got two tattoos: a kangaroo on my right calf, a wrap-around  crocodile on my left bicep. I tell ya, when I came back from the outback, I was really tan. Long about January, I started to fade, and I decided, "To  heck with it. I want to make my own tan." So I got my sun bed. took back from Australia was that life is short, so it's so  important to live and love every day like it was my last. <br/>Debb: We have about 340 inmates here, and they all have  color television and cable. They have seen everything there is about me. They know as much about me as my own mother, it seems. Life isn't all a bed of roses after this show is over. When I come in to work, I never know when I walk through this  door what I'm going to get bombarded with. So, why don't you wait a second and see if you can hear what I'm  talking about. What do you think of me and Survivor? <br/>Go [ bleep] yourself! <br/>Debb: That's what I thought. <br/>You [ bleep] freak. <br/>Debb: Thank you. What am I saying? You come home from Australia after being voted off first, and  the entire country hates your guts? I don't know, I wasn't ready for that. Before Survivor,I was happy. I was with my husband 20 years. I loved him for 20 years and we were together. He died. He died. I fell in love with his son. He is the best thing that ever happened in my life. The times I'm the happiest are when I'm here with him and the  dogs, the bird. Ready? <br/>BOB EATON: When Debb got into it, you know, it was fine. I was behind her 100%. I just kind of wanted to not be a part of it at all, but it  didn't work out that way. <br/>Debb: Somebody at the National Enquirersaw my name, Debbie  Eaton, and my boyfriend, Bob Eaton. "'Eaton and Eaton' and they're not married? Whoa, let's check into that." Maybe it was naive on my  part. I mean, did I know that the public would find out that Bob and I  were a couple? Sure. But I also thought the public was intelligent enough and  understanding enough that when they heard the circumstances, they weren't  going to... it wasn't going to be, like, a witch hunt. It has been like a witch hunt. It's really sad that there are so many people in the world who  just get a kick out of kicking people when they're down. They're kicking you when you're down. Survivorfor me has been a double-edged sword. Did I have some great experiences? You bet I did. But it's living with the after affects now. Was it worth having that experience to be feeling like this? If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't do it all over  again. That's all. I wouldn't. <br/>Kel: You know what? Every time I hear the word "Jerri..." I feel like  dragging my hand down a chalkboard. "Jerri."  Jerri: I saw him put something in his mouth. <br/>Maralyn: What she thought was beef jerky. <br/>Kel: It just drives me nuts! I was so relieved when I got voted off and I came back to being  a soldier again. Because the Army accepted me with open arms. I mean, they didn't believe the lies. I knew that I would have to come back to an intelligence  community where we base everything upon our integrity. Radio check, over. I hold a top-secret clearance. I wasn't going to do anything to jeopardize that top-secret  clearance. <br/>Maralyn: There wasn't any beef jerky. <br/>Kel: I have been approached by a lot of beef jerky  companies, which I find hilarious. I'm actually going to be making money off Jerri's lies. I find that the sweetest revenge. I love it. One day I walk in, and there's this huge dart board of Jerri. It's got her picture on it, and all the soldiers are just  going... they're so angry, and they're just, like... they're hammering this  photo. We've had to replace that photo several times. <br/>Jerri: I am a very kind, honest, straightforward,  creative, artistic vulnerable person. <br/>Colby: Jerri is a bitch, she is! But she's a bitch that will be laughing all the way to the bank. <br/>Jerri: I was just being myself, I was strong, I was  outspoken, I confronted people when they needed to be confronted. No, no, no, no, no, no! We're going to talk right now! I was this woman everyone loved to hate. I didn't like it at all. I didn't want people to hate me. I wanted people to like me. It saddened me more than anything that people's behavior can get  so evil, including my own. My own intentions, in some cases were very selfish and  selfcentered. Coming back to L.A. was a little overwhelming, just because I remember sitting there  and looking around my apartment, and knowing that I couldn't call anybody or  have anyone comfort me, because they didn't understand. And I couldn't tell them. It was by far the loneliest experience I think I've ever had. Long before Survivor,I was struggling. I was at a total point of bartender burnout from ten years of  bartending, and struggling as bartender burnout from ten years of bartending,  and struggling as an actress. Acting is my lifelong dream. It's my life. My dad always used to say to me, "What are you going to  fall back on?" And I used to tell him, "I'm not going to  fall." [ laughs] I was crushed when you were voted off Survivor. It's nice to know some people out there understand me. They don't all think I'm horrible. I think the major thing that's different in my life after  Survivor is that my appointment book is full! [ laughs]  Here we go, this is The Young and The Restless. Production Number 7142. <br/>Jerri: I just learned very early on what I wanted to do  with my life. Failure is my biggest fear. <br/>Jeff: When we come back, the man who took his whole town  on an adventure...  I've got like a famous guy on my shirt. <br/>Jeff: ...and what the Survivors really think about each  other. <br/>None of the words I'm coming up with are nice. [ laughs]  Jeff: But first, here's what one of last year's survivors  has to say about this year's crowd. <br/>RUDY: Them people had to be pretty dumb to build their  camp in a riverbed. You know, when it rained, it washed away, and they blamed the  elements, but I blame their dumbness. <br/>Jeff: Welcome back. Well, for a bunch of people who didn't have much to eat, this  crowd sure knows how to dish. <br/>JEFF K: All right, I can't get past the fact that you want  me of all people to talk about people. Alicia Calaway. Boo yaw, bootie! [ laughs]  Tina: Jeff, that little devil. <br/>Michael: Jeff? [ laughs] None of the words I'm coming up with are nice. <br/>Elisabeth: Michael Skupin is just plain nuts. <br/>Alicia: Kimmi Kappenberg. <br/>Kimmi: Alicia Calaway. <br/>Alicia: Not my type of person. <br/>Kimmi: We just don't see eye to eye. I think it's a height thing. <br/>Jeff: Jerri Manthey. Jerri Manthey. <br/>Keith: Jerri and I are in counseling right now. <br/>Colby: Jerri. God, where do you start with Jerri? <br/>Jerri: Colby's a very attractive guy. He's a boy. [ laughs] I need a man. [ laughs]  Kel: Colby reminds me of a cheesy cowboy. <br/>Colby: The only thing that comes to mind when I think of  Kel is... socially inept. <br/>Debb: Nick? Was Nick on Survivor? <br/>Keith: Nick? Oh, Nick, I'm sorry. <br/>Amber: Maralyn, I love her to death. <br/>Maralyn: Amber was the mad pup. <br/>Amber: This is killing me! Being on Survivoris winning the lottery in a different kind of  manner. Instead of getting a huge lump sum of money and then deciding  what I wanna do with it, I get this huge big title: Amber from Survivor, Do  what you want with that. But a lot of people mess up when they win the lottery and end up  spending it all in one place and regret what they do with it... Coming from a  small town, I think it's very scary looking at the decisions I have to make. I'm very scared and very nervous. I just don't want to mess this up for me. So, certain decisions, like should I pose for Playboyor should I  not pose for Playboy, things like that, are a huge pressure. My whole family has lived within ten minutes of each other  pretty much my entire life, so me moving away could be a big deal. <br/>Amber's decisions at this point will really make her or  break her. It's not that easy, there's always a new face coming out and she  could be forgotten. She's 22, yes, but boy, I tell you what, the next thing you know,  you're 40. <br/>Amber: It's amazing how much I think I've changed as a  person from before Survivorto now. I have a completely different expectation in life now. I want to take advantage of this experience. I mean, why not? <br/>Rodger: Suk, suk, suk. Come here, girl. Suk, suk, suk, suk. This fame thing is probably a fleeting thing and I realize that. I tell people, I say, when I go up to feed my cows, they still  look at me the same way they did before I left to go on Survivor.I'm the same  person. I'm very satisfied with the way that I live. I've got a good wife, a nice daughter, a nice son-in-law and I  live here on the farm and really, I'm just very well pleased. <br/>Before he left, dad was very reserved, and you know wasn't  one to show his emotions, I don't think, at all. I think the show has opened him up a little bit, and that's just  been a total plus, I think. It really opened the doors for showing our feelings. <br/>Rodger: Being gone that length of time did give me a new  realization and even a deeper appreciation for what I have here at home. <br/>He thinks so much of his daughter, Angela, and she's 29. I thought if there were some young ones on there, I thought they  would go to him as a father figure, and I think that's what has happened. <br/>Elisabeth: I'm just thankful, he made it home for me out  there. And I know that my dad is so happy that I had someone like that  by my side. <br/>Rodger: For me personally, it was never about the money. I wanted to see how I would do in a survival situation, especially  being over 50... I can't breathe. ...and against, as it turned out, a whole lot younger people in  excellent physical condition. <br/>I did not know that he was going to have to jump off a  cliff or any of that. I would've just been at wit's end. We were so concerned, you know he has back trouble and he  couldn't swim. <br/>Jeff: Go! When Rodger Bingham jumped off that cliff into that water, being  totally unable to swim, I just looked at that man and I thought, that's what  it's all about. <br/>Rodger: Suk, suk, suk...  I'm really glad he went. It was his adventure of a lifetime. And this has been a ride for us. A ride for us and our community. <br/>This little town, it wasn't popular. But when he went on Survivor, it made our town like so popular. And it's great! It's just so awesome because I got like a famous guy on my  shirt, his signature and everything. <br/>Rodger: I had one girl that came up and asked me for my  autograph, and I went through first grade all the way through high school  with her and I looked at her, her name was Louise, and I said "Louise,  what do you want my autograph for? I said, I've known you since I was six years old!"  Jeff: Just ahead...  KELLY: Kimmi, she was fussing at everybody about being a  vegetarian. You know, you start interfering with people's food, you're not  going to last too long. <br/>Jeff: Welcome back. The players in our next group all said living in New York  prepared them for living in the outback. Now the outback had reshaped their hopes and dreams. <br/>JEFF K: This experience was the most unbelievable, the  most amazing, the most life-altering thing I've ever experienced in my entire  life. I've been living in New York City for the last seven years  working for technology companies. I was burnt out. I was getting sick a lot. I, you know, had days that I just couldn't get up in the morning  and go. I dreaded going into work. I was miserable. I just woke up one day and said, "This is not the way my  life is supposed to be. It's not the way it's going to be." I learned very early in  my life that going through something challenging and difficult changes you. You come out such a bigger, better, stronger person than you  were before. The experience for me was not about winning a million dollars,  even though I was trying really hard to win the money. [ all talking at once] It was about pushing myself and becoming  another person as a result. becoming another person as a result. [ cheers and applause] I have an agent that I never thought I'd  have. You know, I have friends that are actors and entertainers that  have worked all their lives to get an agent. And I go camping, and boom, I got one. <br/>I did speak to telepictures, and they liked you a lot. <br/>Good morning, Jeff. Welcome to KCK! <br/>Jeff Varner! <br/>Good morning. <br/>Jeff, good morning it's Karen and Scott. How are you? <br/>Jeff: Eh, good morning, I'm doin' good. <br/>What was the deal between Michael and the pig? <br/>Jeff: He killed it and we ate it. <br/>We're going to Pittsburgh, they're taping. <br/>Jeff: Oh, God, I fell asleep. <br/>What's more tough, working your way through the Australian  outback or working your way through midtown Manhattan? <br/>Did you masturbate on Survivor II? And I want to say, "Didn't you hear the answer to  that the last 50 times I said it?" Ciao, I am done. Thank God! <br/>Alicia: This is the real me, I hope you all know that I'm  not as serious and cutthroat as I may have seemed on the show. Don't jump all over me, sweetheart. Don't ever...  Kimmi: Don't wave your finger in my face...  Alicia: I will always wave my finger in your face! You want me to say it to your face? <br/>Kimmi: Yes. <br/>Alicia: I'm tired of you and the [ bleep] chicken. My life before Survivorwas very controlled, regimented, and I  like structure. You know, you always think that you are on the path that you're  going to continue on, and then life just throws you something, and it takes a  curve and goes off in a whole other direction. I was a presenter at the Sports Emmys. There's also some photo shoots coming up for Muscle and Fitness. <br/>And just think about relaxing mouth and jaw. <br/>Alicia: I used to say to my clients all the time, if they  say they can't do something... Come on, push three, don't hesitate at the  bottom. ...I would always come back to them and say, "Listen,  you're going to tell me you can't do it? I ate grasshoppers! I stood on a pole for ten hours. Don't tell me you can't do it, because I know you  can."  Kimmi: Those are the tulips that I planted two days before  I went to Australia. <br/>That's right. <br/>Kimmi: My life before Survivorwas just, you know, bartending,  hanging out with my family. My grandmother is a riot. She's 85 years old. <br/>Aunt Kimmi! <br/>Kimmi: Being on Survivor really opened up my eyes to the  fact that my family and my friends that I have really are important. The lowest point for me out there was the food challenge. And you get this cow brain, and I just give up. Just give up! Like, this little one ounce of cow brain was ruining my life! It's a mammal. I can't do it. Sorry. But it was a personal reason for me. This is a game show, not my life, and I have to be able to look  in the mirror and go on. <br/>Survivor II'snot-sopopular vegetarian...  I was a presenter at an awards show that deals with animal  rights. <br/>...who lost one million dollars, but not her convictions! <br/>Kimmi: And that was just an amazing thing because the  animal rights community has embraced me...  Kimmi Kappenberg! [ cheers and applause] ...For something that I'm believing in  people are like cheering me on, whereas when I was out in Australia, people weren't  so happy about that. He doesn't have a good gardener then. I guess the whole experience just reaffirms any of the beliefs  that you have. You got to walk like a duck. And it really doesn't matter what other people think. It's not my job to make everybody else happy. Bottom line, nice and easy, that's what the show taught me, that  it's okay to be yourself. <br/>Mitchell: I really wasn't lazy or... boring. This is the cover of People. You'll notice Julia Roberts actually signed it for me. You see, we're on the same cover. And a little funny thing that I like to do with this is to go  like this. Watch this Julia, me... [ kissing noise] See, she's kissing me. I get approached a lot about people's music careers. <br/>I want to sing. <br/>Mitchell: Oh, are you a singer? I don't say it to them, but I have to think to myself, what do  you expect me to do for you, because I'm in the same boat as A singer. A singer right here, everybody. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Mitchell: Every time I do a speaking engagement, there's  always an autograph line. And I tell you what, the scary people hang out at the very end  of the line. [ laughs] That's when you got to try and wrap it up, because  they're waiting to talk to you about something. <br/>Jeff: When we return, he was at the center of some of the  show's most memorable moments. <br/>GERVASE: The guy killed a pig, man. The guy's a whack job."  Jeff: Everyone fell in love with Elisabeth... well, almost  everyone. <br/>JENNA: It's like a drinking game. Every time Elisabeth tears up, take a drink. She annoys the crap out of me. <br/>Jeff: You can't spend weeks in the outback without  developing strong feelings about people's personalities. When we asked the survivors who they would least like to get  stuck with on a desert island, the tribe spoke-- Jerri. But, surprisingly, when we asked who got the worst rap, the  answer, once again-- Jerri. As for who they would most like to get stuck with on a desert  island, it was a tie between Jeff, and the only person besides Tina not to be  voted out, Michael. <br/>Michael: Success before I went on Survivorwas about  success in business. It was about making more money. <br/>Pre- SurvivorMike was go, go, go. Rush as much into a day as you could. And get as much fun and enjoyment out of life as there was to be  had. <br/>MIKE: Ok, baby. That's the first dogfish I've ever gotten out here. <br/>Michael: While I was out on Survivor,I started to pray,  and I started to develop a relationship with God that I'd never knew before. [ screaming]  Get the water. <br/>You okay? <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Nick: He's burnt. He's burnt pretty bad. <br/>Michael: The most significant point of my spiritual  journey is when I fell into the fire. I didn't understand it at the time, because I thought at that  point, potentially, I had a chance to win it. And that my journey was going to be a lot different. And why would God let me fall into the fire? And I've since learned that it was the greatest, most  significant turning point in my life, spiritually. What I'm here to tell you is it wasn't about Survivorand it  wasn't about a million dollars and it wasn't about a TV show, and it wasn't  about the healing of my hands. It was about the healing of my heart. [ applause] A friend of mine started a "War on  Addiction" campaign. Last year, people didn't have any reason or desire to listen to  Mike Skupin. But now kids flock like crazy to hear stories about Survivor. And right when we get them laughing, we hit them with the truth  about addiction. The choices that you guys and that all of us adults make in life  could cost us a lot more than a million dollars. The choices that we make in life could cost you your life. <br/>Post SurvivorMike is more of a family man, more of a  husband. And he's always been a great father, but he's more of a centered  father now. <br/>Michael: Now, my definition of success has nothing to do  with my job or nothing to do with my income, and it has everything to do with  my relationship with God and my relationship with my family. When you set those priorities in your life, everything else just  falls into place. <br/>Nick: Being lazy is the one thing I didn't want to be  called. You know, it's amazing. Everybody now thinks I'm Mr. Lazy. <br/>JEFF K.: I hate that I've I pinned him with that lazy rap,  because it stuck. <br/>Nick: I always think, like, how can you make the Harvard  law student, army officer, a lazy guy? <br/>Jeff: Nick Brown is not lazy! <br/>Nobody gets through Harvard law school by being lazy. <br/>Nick: I don't think Survivor has changed me dramatically  as far as like what I want to do with my life. You know, I'm not dropping out of law school. I have finals like everybody else. It has made me a risk taker, much more willing to just say,  "You know, forget it, let's go. Let's do it." I'm going to take that step off the cliff. And I may land on my feet, or I may not. Somebody asked me, like, "When you die however long from  now, will Survivorbe on your gravestone?" And I was like "God, I  hope not." I wouldn't mind if it was, like, Governor Nick Brown, who  once got his start on this you know TV show that was popular. That's fine. But if this is, you know, the highlight of my life, I'll be kind  of sad. This is just the beginning. <br/>Elisabeth: Well, I think people underestimate me  sometimes. They shouldn't. [ laughs] I could sneak up on you. I think that I've always been that type of person that said, you  know, "I'm going to give it 120%." You're the man! Woo-hoo! The basic idea of leaving the ones you love kind of puts your  relationships to a challenge. And I had no doubt going into it, but everyone else said,  "Oh, this is going to be the major test."  Rodger: I found a little rock out here, about that tall,  shaped like a heart. <br/>Elisabeth: He said, "Here you go, what's that look  like?" And I said, "A heart." He said, "You, give it to  your boyfriend when you get back."  When Elisabeth came back, she gave me a rock, shaped like  a heart. It was pretty neat to know that, you know, she held onto this,  through the floods, and through everything that went on, and brought it back  here, and gave it to me. <br/>Elisabeth: Then coming back, my gosh, if I could have  proposed to that boy coming off the plane, I would have gotten down on my  knee and said, "I am marrying you, and you are marrying me. And I've had enough of this not talking."  I've known for a long time, that, you know, there wasn't  anybody else that I wanted to be my wife. <br/>Elisabeth: On his birthday, he decided that we'd take one  of those unknowns away. <br/>One thing I wanted to make certain was that we were going  to be together forever. <br/>Elisabeth: And all of a sudden, Tim just kind of... he  said, "The only thing that would make this more special is if you would  just make me the happiest man in the whole world and be with me forever, and  if you marry me." He put the ring on my finger and he said "You  didn't answer me yet." And I said "yes." I must have said  "yes" a million times. I'm just the most blessed girl in the whole world. I am so happy. What do you think about February? I kind of think a winter wedding would be fun. <br/>Why February? <br/>Elisabeth: Because...  No, but why not April or May? <br/>Elisabeth: My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer just  over five years ago. And she had a really tough time with it. She's my hero, and with her I can do anything. She is a woman of supreme faith. To look cancer in the face and say, "No, I'm going to win  this, and I'm going to win it for my kids and for my husband and for this  family." I hope that I can be that strong. <br/>Everybody thinks they're just seeing a pretty girl, with a  pretty face. And that's not all she has. <br/>Elisabeth: I know that I can get through tougher times,  and you know, I came back into open arms. And I feel so loved right now. And you know, how can you not just feel more? I just feel more. <br/>Jeff: When we come back, the final three and what it took  to get there. <br/>JENNA: At the end, you can say, "Sorry, I did what I  did for a million dollars."  Survivoris not a nice game. You have to be willing to compromise yourself, compromise your  beliefs. <br/>Jeff: And then there were three: a mother from Tennessee,  a chef from Michigan, and a tough, young Texan. All shrewd, all strong, but each dealing with success in a  different way. <br/>Keith: You got them? Donna, that sauce you made is good. Open these two and put them in the hot box. Is there more cucumbers? Playing the game Survivor, you're a cast member on the number  one television show in all of America. <br/>How much rice are we going to see you...  Keith: Hey, don't use that four-letter word with me. Survivor magnifies what you've done in life. I filed bankruptcy I think five or six years ago, something like  that. And I filed it because of a business transaction that didn't go  right. I went into Survivor playing for a million dollars. I came out of Survivor realizing it wasn't about the money at  all. People ask me all the time, would you ever do Survivor again? There isn't enough money in the world to do that for me. I can't do it. Can't do it to my kids. Can't ever do that again. Hey, Dad. How you doing? I was adopted when I was six week's old. <br/>I know you. <br/>Keith: Get over here. Dad has Alzheimer's. It's tough stuff. I'm his custodial guardian. In World War II, which plane were you on? <br/>B-24s. Right here. <br/>Keith: This one right here? <br/>Yep. <br/>Keith: He spends his whole day looking for and remembering  what he just did moments ago. Did you take your medicine today? <br/>What medicine? <br/>Keith: I'm a big kid, basically. Stuck in a 41-year-old body. I love to work out, play tennis, things like that. No more salt. Chefs by nature are physical people. You know, we touch, we feel, we smell, we change things from the  original form they were in, to make them something that's edible and  delicious. Before I left to go to the outback, we had talked about getting  married someday and stuff like that. But there was nothing planned as far as an engagement or  anything. So when I proposed to Katrin, she never saw it coming. <br/>Jeff: Thanks to technology, you're about to chat online  with your loved ones. <br/>Keith: Aw. Is that amazing. I can only think of one important question. Will you marry me, please? <br/>Are you serious? When you love someone, you... and the proposal comes, you kind  of want to see their face, and the sincerity. So actually finally watching the show to see his face, when he  was doing it, it just... it brought that whole thing together. <br/>Keith: Yes! [ cheers and applause]  I think we're going to be okay. I really, really love him. <br/>Keith: Because of my rice incident, in the outback, it's  afforded me a new opportunity. So I'm writing a new book. And it's called, "Yes, I can cook rice." And I owe  that to Jerri. Thank you, Jerri. <br/>Colby: I was living in West Texas, my hometown. Basically, packed up the bags, got everything loaded and ready  to go. And then I left for Australia. I remember leaving my mom. And the last thing she said to me was, "Remember, this is a  game. You're playing with people you don't know." It was a cool  feeling arriving in the outback and feeling very at home. West Texas, where I'm from, we have a lot of tall, dead grass  and sparse trees and a few hills. You know, Australia, when we arrived there, that's the way it  was. Except for the kangaroos. We don't have a whole lot of those in West Texas. My mother had said to me, "No matter what happens, no  matter what the outcome, you are coming back to people that love you."  The easiest way to find out who your true friends are is to go and get on a  TV show and play a game like Survivor. Because your best friends don't treat you any different. I'm still the big dork I was in college and they know me as  that. I'm Colby. <br/>The people that have known Colby for a big part of his  life have always known that he was probably not going to lead an ordinary  life. <br/>Colby: I've always pushed myself and driven myself. When I talk about doing something, I do it. <br/>Ever since his first tricycle, Colby's wanted to go as  fast as possible. <br/>Colby: Where I'm from, my hometown has 300 people. When I returned from Australia, I moved to Dallas immediately. <br/>Colby is 27, he's single. I think maybe a little bit of it also was having more anonymity  in Dallas. Being able to hide out. <br/>Colby: I have not allowed myself to think about what's  possible in the future. Right now I'm focused with the day-to-day. And I've got to maintain the life that I've had and known for a  long time. And that's not to say I haven't set goals for myself. But I don't even know yet what some of those goals may be. <br/>Jeff: The winner of Survivor: The Australian Outback... [  cheering]  Tina: The first emotion was total shock and disbelief. Of course the next emotion was joy. And then after that, I think I felt proud... that an older woman  could win this game. <br/>Tina! Tina! <br/>Tina: It's still very bizarre for me when people call my  name because I think I'm supposed to know them. It's just above and beyond anything that I ever imagined. <br/>Tina! Tina! Tina! Tina! <br/>Jeff: In the end, it was the mother of two from Knoxville  who was the sole survivor. In her own words, she was part caring, part cunning and just  plain lucky. <br/>Tina: Hi, how are you? <br/>Good, how are you doing? <br/>Tina: I knew that it was a popular show and that the  people who were on the show were getting a lot of notoriety. And I had no idea it would be this big. Now I can't leave my house without looking halfway decent  because I know, at some point in the day, I'll have to have my picture taken  with somebody. And I never knew this many people actually carried cameras with  them throughout the day. <br/>Rice paddies! <br/>I'm Tina's husband. I'm very famous now. Hey, you want to eat? I have all these people come up and talk to me, "Hey, what  about Tina? What about this?" Very popular guy. Then Tina walks up beside me and all of a sudden I become the  invisible man. Then I become the photographer. Rice patties! We'll have, you know, everybody around just standing there  going, "Could you take our picture with Tina?" You want me in  there? "No, no, no, you take our picture." Oh, okay, sure. No problem. <br/>Mom, she always dresses up now. She's got, like, nice pants and a good, nice shirt. <br/>Tina: I got Kenny, Susan, Kenny, Kelsey. <br/>We used to... we were just Tennessee hillbillies. <br/>Tina: Oh, good answer! <br/>All the kids want to be my best friend. <br/>Tina: ...for this beautiful spring day that you gave us. The things that were important to me before Survivorare the  things that are important to me now. Which would be God, family, and fun. There are the two sides of me. There is the side of me that is trying to be a good wife and a  good mother. Hey, hey, hey, guys! Then there's that other side of me that loves to hang out with  the motorcycle gang, and go off to do a Survivorfor six weeks, and leave the  family to go do that, which a lot of people see as very selfish. But it's like I told my children, you know, "It's not just  children who have dreams. Adults have dreams too."  When we go to a restaurant now, we face the wall, and  still, this, you're sitting there eating, and people are standing there, and  they come up. <br/>Tina: Who do you want me to make it out to? <br/>My name's Billie. <br/>Tina: You're welcome so much. <br/>"Tina, we love you, can I have your autograph?"  And it's great, she loves them. <br/>Tina: Thank you. Nice to meet you. So she stops. Then the food gets cold. We're starting to order salads more now. <br/>Tina: When people come and ask me for an autograph or just  want to talk to me, I realize I live in Knoxville, Tennessee, and not a lot  happens here. And so this is big for Knoxville. And if I was in their shoes, I think I'd be pretty dang excited,  too. <br/>We went on a cruise back around spring break. She'll be out of Knoxville, nobody will recognize her. We'll just kind of be incognito, and walk out on the boat, and  we're going to go look at the pool, so we walk in on the pool, and the first  thing you hear is, "It's Tina!"  Tina: I don't want much to change in my life. I've got two kids who I worship and adore and an awesome husband  who adores me. But at the same time I also realize that I have been given an  incredible opportunity. <br/>Jeff: We'll be right back an incredible opportunity. <br/>Jeff: We'll be right back with a look at the site of our  next adventure. <br/>Jeff: Next season on Survivor... Africa. A land of stunning beauty, but also a land of inherent dangers,  filled with exotic and deadly animals. The continent may have changed, but the game is still the same:  outwit, outplay, outlast. Thanks for joining us. I'm Jeff Probst, and I'll see you in the fall, on Survivor. [ Survivor theme playing]
