<br/>JEFF Probst: 21 Days ago, 18 former castaways returned to  play the ultimate game one more time. They were split into three tribes and marooned with only one  machete. It was the least amount of supplies ever given to a group of  survivors. Their experience and their eagerness to prove that they were the  best of the best set the stage for one of the most cutthroat  Survivoradventures ever. All aspects of the game were escalated. The conflict...  I'm not yelling. I'm just saying, call it like it is. <br/>I am calling it like it is. We just talked about it. [ thunder rumbling]  Probst: The emotion...  It's not worth it. <br/>Probst: ...and the struggle to survive. <br/>Shark bite! <br/>He was not letting go. He was never letting go. <br/>Probst: Tonight, in a special episode, we'll take a closer  look at the first 21 days of Survivor All-Starsthrough a series of  highlights...  Due to someone who is very ill at home right now, I need  to pull myself out of the game. <br/>Probst: ...and never-before-seen footage. <br/>We all decided to be Saboga, who was going to Tribal  Council that night. And we had a blast. <br/>All of you Survivor All-Stars,I think it is time to vote. <br/>My vote is for Jerri! <br/>Homey's walking funny because he has a small problem of  chafing going on. <br/>And now he's walking more and more hobbled as the days go  by. [ laughs]  Things down in the nether regions have become a bit  chapped. It hurts.

No one has ever gone back to play this game twice. We know how bad it gets, and we know how long this road is. <br/>This ain't a little boy's game. This is for the big boys. <br/>All-Star Survivoris going to be so cutthroat, it's not  even going to be funny. Nobody trusts anybody, you understand? <br/>Probst: For the first time, there were three tribes--  Chapera, Mogo Mogo and Saboga. When the tribes arrived at their beaches, they found only a  machete and a map to their water hole. <br/>Oh, nice! <br/>We did find our water source, but we can't drink it right  out of the well. There's potential brain parasites that will put you in a coma. <br/>Probst: The water had to be boiled, but starting a fire  with no supplies bordered on the impossible. <br/>That's it. <br/>Come on! Come on! <br/>I did it for two days in Borneo. I can't do fire. I have tried. <br/>All right. There's that positive attitude we're looking for. <br/>I'm running out of steam. <br/>Yeah, I think I could start the fire without even  blinking, but they don't need to know that. [ laughs]  Probst: In the midst of the struggle for fire at Saboga...  [ Rupert sighs]  My head's ready to pop. <br/>Probst: ...Rudy struck a deal with Rupert. <br/>I think, uh, me and you ought to think about an alliance. <br/>You're a man of your word, too, from what I know of you. <br/>Yeah. I, uh, figured me and Rupert ought to protect ourselves and form  an alliance, and that's what we did. <br/>You and I are going to be strong to the end. [ Rudy speaks quietly]  Probst: At Chapera, it was Boston Rob and Amber who were  making a connection. <br/>So, what do you think? You want to make an alliance? Cover our own asses? <br/>I don't know if I can take you seriously or not. <br/>I'm being 100% serious. Amber and I have an alliance, for obvious reasons. She's beautiful. Any idiot can see that. <br/>Probst: While Rob and Amber's alliance seemed to be made  from the heart, Rob's alliance with Big Tom was all business. <br/>You watch my back, Tom, I'll watch yours, all right? <br/>Me and Rob's got a little alliance. No, I don't trust him. Hell, no. But I don't trust none of 'em, and, uh, if Rob will hang in  there with me, we can pull this thing through. <br/>It's humid, huh? Big Tom wants to make an alliance with me. He wants to stay tight with me, you know? I got my thing going with Amber. I got Big Tom on the side. I think in his eyes it's a primary alliance. In mine, it's secondary. But he doesn't need to know that. Not until the time comes. <br/>Probst: At the first three-way immunity challenge...  Survivors, ready! <br/>Here we go, here we go. <br/>Probst: Go! ...Saboga fell behind early and never recovered. <br/>Come on, guys, get me over there. <br/>Probst: And Chapera and Mogo Mogo shared immunity. Chapera, Mogo Mogo, congratulations. Safe from Tribal Council and out here at least three more days. [ cheering] Having dodged the first Tribal Council, Chapera  decided to create one of their own. <br/>Come on in. First, from Survivor one,Rudy Boesch. Next, the winner from Survivor Africa,Ethan Zohn. From Survivor Pearl Islands, Rupert. From Survivor Australia,Jerri Manthey. There's Jerri. <br/>I just want to pour some hot chocolate over some hot guy's  bod. <br/>The winner from Survivor Australia,Tina Wesson. And from Survivor Borneo,Jenna Lewis. <br/>Oh, I'm so glad to be here, everybody! Oh! Jeff, Jeff! Oh, Jeff, oh. <br/>Let's settle down. <br/>We all decided to be Saboga, who was going to Tribal  Council that night. And we had a blast doing it. <br/>Here we are, day three. All of you "SurvivorAll-Stars." What's going on? Jerri? <br/>What... what is happening here? I don't deserve this. The last time I played Survivor,we were pretty serious, but  everybody here is a comedian. There is not one person who's not. <br/>Rupert, you've been here for Survivor: Pearl Islands. Three months later, you're now back here in Survivor: Pearl  Islands. <br/>The only reason I come back, someone messed with the  handlebar of my.... <br/>I didn't touch your spear, Rupert. I never touched your spear. <br/>[ growling]: Rudy! <br/>Come on! <br/>How's my hair, Jeff? I played Ethan because I just wanted to give him a hard time and  let everybody realize how ridiculous he looks with his little jheri curls. <br/>I think it is time to vote. <br/>My vote is for holy roller Tina. She stabbed me in the back once. She's not going to do it again. Tina. <br/>Jenna, I'm sorry to have to vote for you. It's just a game. Sorry, babe. <br/>[ In Southern accent]: Lord, please forgive me for my  language that I am about to use right now, but Miss Jerri Manthey, I am  voting for you. You were a bitch the first time on Survivor Australiaand three  years hasn't done you any good. You're still a bitch. My vote is for Jerri! <br/>I thought everybody was funny at Tribal Council from Amber  playing Tina to Rob playing Jeff Probst. I mean, the kid's obviously watched a couple Survivors. He's got him down pat. <br/>Jenna, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>See y'all. [ all imitating theme song] [ imitates soundtrack chanting] [  thunder crashing]  Probst: But the real Tribal Council was no joke for the  losing Saboga tribe. During a downpour, the stigma of being a former winner was too  much for Tina to overcome and she was the first person voted out of Survivor  All-Stars. Tina, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Tina: I knew early on that I was in trouble. You know, there was only one other winner, and I knew that they  would keep Ethan as the stronger one. But what a mistake it would be to not even play the game. So that's why I came back, and it's been a blast. <br/>Probst: On day four, Colby was dealing with a delicate  situation. <br/>Colby's walking funny because he has a small problem of  chafing going on. I think he has chafed the inner side of his inner thigh. <br/>And now he's walking more and more hobbled as the days go  by. [ laughing]  A true Texan at heart never complains. <br/>Yeah, things down in the nether regions have become a bit  chapped. My gait, if you will, is my attempt to get a little air flow  going in there and hopefully with a little time, everything is going to heal. But that's the only way I can get relief, is just being as  bowlegged as a bull rider who just stepped off a 3,000-pound nightmare. It hurts something fierce. <br/>Probst: Later on day four, a mysterious box with three  locks arrived at tree mail. <br/>Anything at this point that you get to open is fun because  it's like a gift. <br/>Probst: In a grueling reward challenge, Ethan carried  Saboga to their first victory. <br/>Probst: Saboga wins reward! But with the reward, Saboga faced a tough decision. Each tribe today received a lockbox. I'll tell you what is in the lockbox. Rice. The only problem is that lockbox and the rice in it does you no  good because you need three keys to get it open. And even if you had it open, without fire, you can't cook the  rice. So here's the offer. If you take the pot with the clue and the map and the flint  instead of the blankets, Mogo Mogo gets it as well as Chapera. <br/>Give everybody a chance. [ cheers]  Probst: With flint, the tribes finally got fire. <br/>Whoa. <br/>We got fire! Yay! <br/>Probst: With the struggle for fire behind them, the  members of Chapera turned their attention to other problems, like  understanding Big Tom. <br/>Hey, we ain't got a good mate among us. <br/>You guys get that? <br/>No. <br/>Big Tom? Who knows his language? He's a huge comic relief. I love sitting back and just listening to Big Tom, even if I  don't understand anything he says. <br/>So anyway, baby doll may want to go over and make a big  glob of love and I tell her...  We need a translator on that one. That was just a little too much. <br/>I have no clue what you just said. All I heard was "gob of love."  Big Tom is by far worst. I mean, half the time nobody knows what he is saying. <br/>There's plenty...  Huh? <br/>I said there's plenty right there. <br/>What? <br/>I said there's plenty over there. <br/>Where:  Over by them rocks. Snails. They sittin' right there. <br/>Yeah, there's plenty of them. I'm telling you, this guy, half the time he talks, I just go  "yesum, uh-huh." You got to have a special degree to be able to  speak Big Tom. [ mumbling] "What?"  Probst: At the immunity challenge on day six... Survivors,  ready? Go! ...the tribes had to raise boats from the ocean floor and race  to the finish. Chapera takes the lead. <br/>Go! <br/>Probst: Chapera cruised to first place, Mogo Mogo's  determination kept them going, and Saboga's hopes for immunity sank  completely along with their boat. Chapera first to cross. Wins immunity! Mogo Mogo wins immunity. For the second straight time, Saboga going to Tribal Council. Back at the Saboga camp, Rupert vowed to stay true to his  alliance with Rudy. <br/>Rudy came to me on the first day saying, "I need a  buddy."  I know what you're saying. I adore him, but we're losing bad. <br/>I am not writing Rudy's name down. I know that. I'm not writing Rudy's name down. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, despite Rupert's loyalty, the  former Navy Seal was the second person voted out of Survivor All-Stars. Rudy, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Jenna, she kept edging me on right to two hours before  they eliminated me. She shouldn't have done that. I wish I would have lasted longer. I'm going to keep doing this until I win. <br/>Probst: On day seven, Richard got up close and personal  with a shark. <br/>I let the head part go for a second, and whoop! Shark bite! And I poke him in the eyes. He takes another chunk deeper. There was no way-- he was not letting go. He was never letting go. So I swam to get on a rock and pound the side of his head with a  rock until he lets go. Ee-yai-yai-yai-yai. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>His teeth? Right there. <br/>SUSAN: Oh, my God. <br/>He's got me, pulling. The hell if you're going to stay on my arm. It's like this. <br/>Is it possible to call a gay man a stud? <br/>It's like man verses nature. So Hemingway-esque. I love it. <br/>Probst: At tree mail, the tribes received a welcomed  surprise. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: The challenge was to build the best possible  shelter in 24 hours. The reward would be a gift of comfort items dropped from the  sky. Boston Rob used his construction expertise and took the reins at  Chapera, and Amber quickly took notice. <br/>I'll admit when I saw him building that shelter... he was  pretty hot building that shelter. He is good at doing what he does. It is getting much easier and easier to flirt with Boston Rob. <br/>Probst: at Mogo Mogo, Jenna's mind just wasn't in the  challenge. <br/>There's a lot of other factors that come into my game that  may not come into anybody else's game, like my mom. She's had cancer for a long time and she's not better. And I'm just afraid she might pass away while I'm here. <br/>Probst: And at Saboga, Rupert and Jerri clashed over  Rupert's log cabin design. <br/>We are going to dig down into the sand a couple feet to  add to our height so when you walk into it, you'll be able to stand up. And that's what I want. <br/>Rupert's a complete control freak. He has to have everything his way. He thinks he's the only one who can do it right. <br/>Probst: As day turned to night, it became apparent that  Rupert was digging Saboga's grave. <br/>Rupert's idea was a little ambitious. We ended up working all through the night. <br/>Not good. <br/>My God, I could not believe the stupidity. This is Rupert gone mad. <br/>Probst: On day eight, a local contractor visited each  beach to determine a winner. I brought along with me Rafa, an expert in construction. Take a look. At Mogo Mogo, things got off to a shaky start. <br/>Rafa-- he starts going around the shelter and the first  thing he does is start grabbing on to things, jerking them, trying to rip  them down. I don't know that Rafa realizes, we have to live in the shelter. <br/>Probst: And at Chapera, things stood on solid ground. <br/>You're not moving this. <br/>This is three foot in the ground, and that... all this is  square. <br/>Probst: Ready? VÃ¡manos? <br/>VÃ¡manos. <br/>Probst: When the contractor saw Rupert's underground  shelter, Saboga's hopes of winning seemed all washed up. <br/>Saboga? Oh...  Probst: You don't like...? <br/>No, no, no. <br/>Probst: It's dangerous? <br/>Yeah. This is the... the water...  And then I see him tell Jeff, "Water go down in. Bad."  Probst: Chapera once again came out on top. Their reward for having the best shelter included blankets, a  mattress and wine. <br/>We've never been so excited in our lives. That was just a pinnacle moment. <br/>Probst: The mood at Mogo Mogo was not so cheerful. Jenna Morasca was contemplating quitting altogether. <br/>Well, I just want to let you guys know there are a lot of  things I thought I would be able to overcome here, but my mom is really ill. I don't think I'd ever forgive myself if I knew that I was here  playing a game and something happened to her. <br/>Probst: When the tribes arrived for the immunity  challenge, Jenna made her decision. <br/>Due to someone who is very ill at home right now, I need  to pull myself out of the game. <br/>Probst: I just want to understand exactly why you're  leaving. <br/>She's my mother, and I should be there in case something  happens. I love this game, but it's my family. <br/>Probst: Let's bring in the boat. <br/>Probst: Jenna, we're thinking about you. <br/>Thanks. Bye, guys. Have fun. <br/>Probst: Jenna Morasca became the second person ever to  walk away from the game. But her instincts were right. Eight days later, her mom lost her battle with cancer with Jenna  by her side. Night nine brought one of the worst storms in Survivor history. <br/>We need a boat. Mayday, mayday, mayday. <br/>We have constructed a shelter that is pretty unbelievable. <br/>The shelter held up pretty good. I slept almost all night long because I was under the blanket,  warm, and I just slept the whole night. <br/>Probst: Well, almost the whole night. <br/>You're so warm. <br/>Boston Rob and Amber are going to do it. I don't know when, but they're going to do it. <br/>Probst: Things weren't so cozy at Saboga. Their underground shelter failed miserably. <br/>The stupid shelter that I built was destroyed. Digging into the sand is the dumbest idea I've ever had in my  life, and we paid dearly tonight for it. <br/>The rain just started pouring and the whole shelter filled  up with water. This never would have happened if they hadn't dug that hole. It's not worth it. <br/>Probst: the next morning, emotionally and physically  spent, Saboga realized they were back to square one. <br/>The plan today is we got to make shelter, we've got to  make fire and we've got to get it together now. <br/>Probst: But once again, Jerri was on the outs with her  tribe. <br/>When we were deciding where to rebuild our shelter for the  third time, Jerri wanted nothing to do with it. <br/>Oh, come on, you gotta help. <br/>She's had enough, you know. Check out. <br/>Once they started working on the actual building process,  that's when I felt it was necessary for me to speak up. You're going to put those on top of the bamboo, uh, the palms,  right? It needs to go on top, 'cause otherwise the palms clog it up and  acts as a... whoosh, instead of a whoosh. <br/>You want to really keep it waterproof. If you want to put it on top, I don't care. I just think with as many palms as we have, we're only going to  get a foot and a half, two feet. <br/>Jenna says put the bamboo on. Jerri says no, don't put the bamboo on and then cops this big  old attitude with me about we can't discuss anything. We always just gotta do it your way. Well, one of you says the bamboo is going under and of you one  says the bamboo's going over. <br/>Well, that's what happens when you discuss two different  views. <br/>Why can't I say discuss it? <br/>Because it's obvious that's what's gonna happen. <br/>I was very fond of Jerri. I thought we were getting along great until we got the challenge  of building a new shelter. A little bit of conflict and now I'm the devil. It makes me feel inadequate when the girl won't even look at me. She will have nothing to do with me right now. That doesmake me uncomfortable. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! On Day Ten, Chapera continued their victory roll when they won a  Survivorstyle bathroom, as well as a clue to the final key to their lock box. Take a shower, get cleaned up. You guys can head back to camp. Chapera, this is yours to take back with you. Chapera enjoyed getting clean...  I could do this all day long every day. <br/>Probst: ...as well as getting the long-awaited rice from  their lock box. <br/>Ah! We got rice! <br/>For to us have rice in our system is just like gas in the  tank, and I think it's gonna give us a little bit, just that little more...  hoochy. <br/>Probst: The rice helped fuel Chapera to a large lead in a  jolting immunity challenge. <br/>Please don't move! <br/>Colby, Colby, Colby, Colby. <br/>Probst: Ethan throws it on Colby. <br/>Ow! <br/>Damn it! <br/>Probst: Chapera has their last piece. Take your blindfolds off. Start building the puzzle. But the pieces didn't fall into place for Chapera, and Saboga  and Mogo Mogo out-stacked them, winning shared immunity. <br/>[ yelling]  Probst: Facing Tribal Council, Rob Cesternino looked for  an ally in Boston Rob. <br/>I know you know how to play the game and I know you know a  lot, and I know you would be very, like, helpful and we can make good allies. <br/>I... I agree. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Rob Cesternino got blindsided  by Boston Rob, and he was the first person voted out of the Chapera tribe. Rob, the tribe has spoken. <br/>I was targeted early for coming close to winning last  time. It is especially painful to not have a fair crack at that  million dollars this time around. Being as big of a fan of Survivoras I am and then having the  opportunity not only to play the game, but to come back and play an all-star  version of the game was really the ultimate thrill. <br/>Probst: On Day 13, the tribes arrived for the reward  challenge, and they were hit with the first big twist of the game. The tribe that finishes last will be dissolved. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: Gonna have a schoolyard game of pick 'em. <br/>That's wild. <br/>Probst: We will alternate picks. The winning tribe gets to pick first. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go Mogo Mogo. <br/>Probst: Mogo Mogo paddled to an easy first-place finish. <br/>[ cheering]  Probst: Chapera's secondplace finish meant Saboga was no  more. <br/>We get to pick first. <br/>Okay. <br/>We got to get rid of Ethan. <br/>Yup. Yeah. <br/>Bring him along, Rich. <br/>Probst: In a strategic move, Mogo Mogo took Ethan and  brought Jerri along for the ride. And Chapera took Rupert and Jenna. At Chapera, Rupert and Jenna were immediately impressed by their  new surroundings. <br/>Oh...  We're home! We're home. <br/>Probst: And the girls soon made sure the tribe was united. <br/>Jenna, Amber and myself made necklaces. We found all the shells and we bonded them together, and they  quickly became symbolic of the unity that Chapera has, even though we have  two new members. We have a present for you. <br/>Ah, ha-ha...  Now we're all...  Cool. <br/>I love it. <br/>It's kinda cool, right? We made necklaces for everybody. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Oh, I like the way you guys did these with the wire. <br/>Don't they look cool? This is about Tribal...  ALICIA and SUE: Unity. <br/>You know, it wasn't apparent over at Saboga how close  Chapera was. We knew that they had some sort of bond that kept them winning  uh... because, you know, they weren't the biggest, they weren't the  strongest, but they kept winning the challenges, but now that I'm over here,  I see that there's really a sense of tribehood here. <br/>I will definitely keep my necklace on and I hope everybody  else will, too. I don't think we should be intimidated by them knowing that  we're a strong tribe and sticking together. We're gonna take them down one by one. <br/>Probst: The competition heated up on Day 15 when the two  newly formed tribes went-head to-head at the immunity challenge. First one to hit the water is out. Boston Rob took control of the game and led his tribe to victory. Chapera wins immunity! <br/>You did it! You did it! <br/>Probst: Back at camp, Colby changed Mogo Mogo's game plan  when he targeted Richard instead of Ethan. <br/>Richard's the one we gotta get rid of. He's the snake in the grass that's going to cause us the most  trouble. <br/>Probst: But Richard got wind of the plot when Jerri tipped  him off, putting Colby on thin ice. <br/>Now, Jerri says she's been approached to get rid of me. The only way that could possibly have happened is Ethan, Lex and  Colby. Okay. That's it, then, 'cause if you're not for anything else, then  we'll just do that. All right, Colby goes. So they blew it. How dare you approach somebody to get rid of me? You must go bye-bye now. <br/>Probst: Despite the scramble before Tribal Council,  Richard, the first Survivorwinner ever, was dethroned. <br/>I've been bamboozled! Man, oh, man. <br/>Probst: Rich, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Food, food. I hope there's some real underlying, intelligent, sophisticated  game-playing going on that undermined me and that I'm not aware of. I'd love it more than anything. I'd be shocked as hell, but it would be fun to see. <br/>Probst: All right. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, definitely. <br/>Please. <br/>Probst: Hopefully you'll like it. <br/>[ shrieks]  Shish kebabs. <br/>Probst: In addition, the winning tribe keeps everything in  the basket. <br/>Oh, we gotta win. <br/>Probst: For reward! Survivors ready! Go! Mogo Mogo stomped their way to an early lead...  Yeah! <br/>Probst: ...and never looked back. And with that, Mogo Mogo wins reward! <br/>[ cheering]  Probst: Take these... and the main course, shish kebab. <br/>Oh, my God, that smells so good. <br/>Probst: That night, despite their hard knocks, Chapera  vowed to stay true to each other. <br/>Look, guys, we should be able to win this, if you think  about it, all right? We're six-strong, they're six-strong. And then we can just roll. <br/>Let's all make a pact to stick together. <br/>One, two, three, Chapera! <br/>Probst: the next morning, Mogo Mogo continued to reap the  benefits of their reward. <br/>We all decided to dip into our coffee bean supply to make  some cowboy coffee. Coffee and sugar. Oh, it's so delicious. We all sat down and drank probably about four cups of the  strongest coffee you can imagine. And none of us have had coffee in about a month. <br/>I'm starting to get spun. <br/>Oh, but it feels good. <br/>It feels so good to be wired. <br/>No more water. Only coffee. <br/>Before we sat down to the coffee, playing checkers just  wore me out. At this point I'm ready to draw a finish line and set up a 100  yard dash and start racing. <br/>Suddenly we're a much more exciting group. <br/>Oh, my God, he's going to do a cartwheel! <br/>Yay, coffee! <br/>Anybody got some coffee? Man, that coffee is good! <br/>You drank coffee? <br/>I think I had some coffee. We had the best coffee of our entire life. Who would have thought just bringing and introducing a little  coffee into the tribe would have made the biggest difference in the world? <br/>I mean, listen to us, we're like bamboozled. This is nuts. The caffeine is just like rifling through our bodies. My eyes are opened. I mean, I thought I was having vision problems. I was also getting my glasses. I just need caffeine. Ready. <br/>It's a very happy beach right now. Don't know how long it will last but as long as we've got  coffee, we're going to be up and smiling. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: on day 19, Boston Rob had his hands full. <br/>I'm out here on a deserted island in Panama, and I got two  beautiful women, and they want to make a sandwich out of me. What am I going to do? Would you say no? Seriously, smarten up. <br/>Boston Rob and Amber are very close, and I'm friends with  both of them, so all three of us sleep connected. I mean, we're rolling around hugging each other. I mean, it's friends. <br/>I'm definitely conscious of Jenna hanging out with Rob a  lot. And I think it's definitely a good thing. It takes some of the tension off of me and Rob hanging out  together. I'm not going to get jealous of any of her hanging on him or  doing anything like that. I have Boston Rob wrapped around my little finger. <br/>Awesome. A strategy to everything, you know? Like there's strategy to putting my arm around Jenna while I  have it around Amber at the same time. You've got to keep your friends close, but you got to keep your  enemies closer. Make no mistake. I'm here to play Survivor. At the end of this, hopefully Amber and I can be having some fun  together, and we'll be spending my million. Worst case scenario, we'll be spending hers. <br/>Probst: At the challenge on day 19, the tribes learned  just how much was at stake. In addition to being a reward challenge, it is also an immunity  challenge. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: One more twist: the winning tribe will select one  member from the losing tribe to join them on the reward, which means they  partake in the barbecue and they avoid Tribal Council. Survivors, ready? Go! Once the challenge got under way... Mogo Mogo with a bit of a  lead. Ethan is off heading into the jungle. Boston Rob close behind! <br/>Come on, Rob! <br/>Probst: ...the race to the finish line was tight. We're neck and neck! In a hard-fought duel, Chapera pulled out a last-moment victory. Mogo Mogo off course now. Chapera heading straight for their dock! Chapera wins reward and immunity! [ cheers] Chapera chose to kidnap Kathy. Kathy. At first, Kathy wasn't comfortable leaving her tribe behind for  a day of luxury. Chapera, by the way, that's your ride, a 94-foot luxury yacht. [ screams] But after a barbecue...  Some people grabbed plates. I didn't even grab a plate. <br/>Probst: ...some dessert...  Oh, look at this, custard. <br/>Probst: ...and a dip under a tropical waterfall... [  screaming] Kathy warmed up to her new friends. <br/>I feel totally welcomed by Chapera. I mean, they brought me in like I was one of their tribe  members. <br/>We got a new girl, her name is Kat We got a new girl, her name is Kat  She fits in just like that  She fits in just like that. <br/>Probst: While Chapera was cruising, Mogo Mogo was getting  down and dirty. <br/>Probst: but Lex had a down and dirty. <br/>Probst: but Lex had a different plan in mind. <br/>You don't get far in this game by playing safe. I find myself now at the doorway of an opportunity to do just  that for the first time in the game, to really do something that probably no  one is going to expect me to do. Their plan is to get rid of you tonight. <br/>I knew that was coming. <br/>They think I'm in with them and that Shii Ann is as well. We're going to do Colby tonight. <br/>I'm very content with that decision. Colby doesn't see this coming at all. He doesn't see a single vote coming in his direction. And if it took losing today to get him out of here, I'm totally  fine with it. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Jerri won the game of cat and  mouse and her revenge was complete. Colby was the next person voted out of Survivor All-Stars. Colby, the tribe has spoken. <br/>I had to make decisions and getting rid of Richard was a  move that my entire tribe had to make, but I was left to orchestrate it and  that really just threw me out in the open. In the other tribe members eyes, it seemed as though I was  trying to become the power player, the shape-shifter. It wasn't that at all, but unfortunately that's the way the game  goes. <br/>Probst: on day 20 with Colby gone, Ethan realized he was  still treading water. <br/>I thought everything was going smoothly and, boom, I  thought I was pretty close to Lex. Not anymore. I don't know what I'm going to do here. <br/>Probst: Later that day, the tribes played for a chance to  loot items from the other camp. Here we go. First match-up, start spinning. Chapera's balancing act led them to a win. <br/>Run, run, run! Run, run, run! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: And Jenna was sent to Mogo Mogo to retrieve a  grill, a bag of rice, and a Hawaiian sling. <br/>I've been waiting 20 days to not have to poke fish with a  stick. I'm going to be the hunter tomorrow. <br/>Probst: while Rupert salivaged over the sling, Boston Rob  and Amber's relationship reached new heights. <br/>You're not ever supposed to feel secure in this game, but  with Rob and I having an alliance, I feel 99.9% secure. <br/>Probst: The following morning a fishing competition began  to brew between Boston Rob and Rupert. <br/>Rupert is all excited about having the Hawaiian sling. You know, it's his baby. Now he can catch a fish and show how much he's worth to the  tribe. First of all, the guy looks like Grizzly Adams but he thinks he  Aquaman in the ocean. And he comes back with a bag of fish feeling all good about himself. <br/>My God, it took all I had to stop. <br/>I proceeded to go into the water and catch 11 fish myself. Boston-style. <br/>Sometimes I really like Boston Rob. <br/>I got two at one time on one of them. <br/>Other times I see kind of an arrogant pain in the ass. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, it was a dismal show of  marksmanship. Before Chapera narrowly escaped with victory. Chapera wins immunity! Mogo Mogo heading to Tribal Council. Back at Mogo Mogo, Lex took his old friend Ethan aside and gave  him some bad news. <br/>I think it's just better for my game if we vote you out  tonight. It has nothing to do with friendship. This is business. I've got my own agenda this time. I've got my own plan. It doesn't include him. This isn't Africa. This is All-Star. <br/>Probst: But Ethan wasn't about to go down without a fight. He approached Kathy with a plan. <br/>There's no rhyme or reason of how Lex is playing this  game. There will be no sense of security with Lex at any time. <br/>But I don't want to take Lex out before Jerri. <br/>No. <br/>It will be Jerri tonight, all right. <br/>So I'll vote for Jerri and then you and Shii Ann can talk  about it. And I'm a gambler. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Ethan's gamble didn't pay off. He was the next person voted out of Survivor All-Stars. Ethan, the tribe has spoken. <br/>I've been just struggling since day one trying to fight  and bite and scramble my way through this game. And I lasted 21 days. And I'm proud. I made it further than any other winner. I have the title of Survivor: Africachampion, and no one can  take that away from me. No matter what I do from this point on for the rest of my life,  I have that, and that's a good feeling. <br/>Probst: Where once 18 all-stars stood, now only ten  remain. What experiences and twists await Big Tom, Amber, Boston Rob,  Alicia, Rupert, Jenna, Lex, Kathy, Jerri and Shii Ann as they attempt to  outlast all the others and become the ultimate sole Survivor? Join us next week as the adventure continues. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. Next time on Survivor. Being on a losing team all the time is just depressing. The gap between both the tribes couldn't be wider. <br/>We were just tickled today. <br/>But while everyone is talking merge-  I'm ready for merge, I'm ready for all this to be one  tribe. What happens next will turn their world upside down. Drop your buffs. I feel like I'm one who got screwed in this whole situation. Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org Just another  beautiful day here on the island. Of Shapire isnt it? Little overcast. Little overcast, Silas. Wind breezing in your face. Out of the northwest. Just smell that? [deep inhale] [deep exhales] You need another shower bro. [chuckles]
