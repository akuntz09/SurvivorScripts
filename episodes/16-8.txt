<br/>Â Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor...  <br/>Yes!  <br/>Probst: ...despite winning challenges... Airai wins!  ...the Airai tribe was losing players. First, Jonathan.  <br/>I can't be here one more minute.  <br/>Probst: Then Kathy. On Exile Island, Ozzy found the hidden  immunity idol and replaced it with a fake one as a decoy, which was  discovered by Jason.  <br/>There we go, baby. I guess this is the hidden immunity  idol.  <br/>Probst: At Malakal, Ozzy practically adopted Erik.  <br/>They're like The Lion King-- the father, when he was  teaching the cub.  <br/>Probst: So when his tribe was facing tribal council, he  knew exactly who he wanted to vote out.  <br/>I don't think that there's any argument for keeping  Tracy.  <br/>Probst: But Ami saw a chance to turn against the favorites  and go after Ozzy.  <br/>Sometimes you have to pull the dirty cards to stay in the  game.  <br/>Probst: Tracy also went after Ozzy, warning everyone that  he's not only the tribe leader but the biggest threat.  <br/>I think I'd be a better tribe member than somebody that's  going to demolish you if you do go to the merge.  <br/>Probst: But in the end, Ami sided with the favorites.  Seventh person voted out of Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites, Tracy. And Tracy  was sent home, leaving Erik as the only remaining fan on the Malakal tribe.  11 are left. 11 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted  out tonight?  <br/>Tonight at tribal, Tracy went home. I feel lucky to be  here still. I feel really, really lucky to still be here and have a shot at  this game. But I am scared to death, because I'm the last fan left, and I  don't think I see any leeway with these favorites. I feel like I'm the next  to go, no matter what happens now in the future. the future.  <br/>Here, scratch my back.  <br/>Here, scratch my back.  <br/>Tribal council was a little bit of an eye opener. Tracy  described me as the leader. I really don't think that I'm the leader. I just  think that I've got a lot of good opinions and a lot of know-how when it  comes to surviving out here, and people respect that. Even though I think I'm  a valuable asset, I'm going to have a giant target on my back. And that's the  kind of situation And that's the kind of situation that I want to avoid. that  I want to avoid.

No, no, no! No, no, no! Go in there! Go in there!  Nice work. All right. This will give a girl a heart This will give a girl a  heart attack. attack. That was fun this morning.  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>Ozzy's like, "Did you guys get anything?"  "No, not really, just eight crabs."  <br/>You guys did awesome!  <br/>We're the crab warriors.  <br/>That's crazy!  <br/>That's crazy! Girl, give me some sugar. Girl, give me some  sugar.  <br/>Well, don't let it get to you  <br/>Well, don't let it get to you yet. yet.  <br/>Well, who cares about that stuff? stuff? Don't worry about  that. Don't worry about that.  <br/>Like, last night, Tracy was trying everything in her power  to get you to get voted off. She was coming to me. She was coming to Cirie.  She's, like, trying everything. Who cares? I stopped anything crazy from I  stopped anything crazy from happening. happening. Yeah.  <br/>Tracy is sneaky.  <br/>It's not that big of a deal, you know. It didn't happen,  and it's not going to happen, so don't worry about it. Okay?  <br/>This morning, Ami ended up telling me that she was  approached by Tracy and asked to vote for me, but she said, you know, that  she wasn't going to do that and she's on my side.  <br/>You're not in any danger. Like, let it go.  <br/>It's just the tribal council last night was kind of  like...  <br/>I'm not leaving you.  <br/>But Ami's a little too adamant about that. And as much as  she says she's on my side, I'm starting to get my side, I'm starting to get  uneasy feelings. uneasy feelings.  <br/>I was dreaming about pizza that I just put in an  oven.  <br/>Fluffy on top.  <br/>Yeah. Mm! I just don't want another bite of coconut. bite  of coconut. I just don't. I just don't. I just don't.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Ah, you got him! Oh, my God!  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  James!  <br/>What?  <br/>He caught a rat!  <br/>I cannot believe you just caught a rat.  <br/>Oh, poor guy. Get the shish kebab and just, like...  <br/>Oh.  <br/>There's nothing on him, though, really. I think I'm going  to feel a little bad eating the rat. You know, he's a small guy. There's not  much meat on there. But you know, out here, we're in the bush, and it's  survival of the fittest. So yeah, I'm going to dig into the rat and give it a  shot. We'll stick a skewer through him, barbecue him up. Nobody has eaten a  rat since the first season of Survivor,so it's kind of cool. I'll be able to  bring that tradition back.  <br/>Ew, look at his tail. He's so yuck.  <br/>I sure the tail is delicious.  <br/>Have you ever had a rat before?  <br/>Never.  <br/>I think Jason's been trying to impress the favorites ever  since the switch up. It's not working, though. It's not working, though. I  think he's a loser. I think he's a loser.  <br/>This is a nightmare over  <br/>This is a nightmare over here. here. This island sucks.  There's nothing but rock. You don't have enough beach area. You can't go  anywhere. There's nothing. It's like pretty much a barren land. You could  live on Malakal. Over here, this is where they bring the criminals.  <br/>I just want to go back to Amanda.  <br/>I just want to go back.  <br/>I want to go back to Amanda and Cirie and Oz.  <br/>This sucks. The original Malakal alliance was supposed to  be myself, Amanda, Parvati, Ozzy, and Cirie. But over here, it's just Parvati  and I. and I. So, I mean, I'm at my wit's end. So, I mean, I'm at my wit's  end.  <br/>Are you nervous?  <br/>Not now.  <br/>Not now. And if we can make it back to And if we can make  it back to the merge, we're fine. the merge, we're fine.  <br/>That would suck. At this point, six people are left in  this tribe, so we need a very solid four to go into the merge. So me and  James are really going to have to pull in two more people, you know, in order  to remain in a strong position in this tribe. This is how I came into this  game, to play in stages. Like, the first stage was, clearly, before the  mix-up, when it was fans versus favorites, and just to get through that, the  first couple of votes. And then we have the mix-up. So we have to play  through this segment to get to the merge. I just feel like I would feel safe  if it was you and Alexis, me and James locked up at four, a block of  four.  <br/>Yeah. I will work with you.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>I think that James, we can still win immunity.  <br/>I think with James, we're fine until the merge. And then  once we get to the merge, all of the targets are going to be on the big guys.  Like, we're going to be able to slip under because everyone's going to be so  threatened by the big guys trying to get them out.  <br/>Ozzy, James.  <br/>Ozzy and James are probably going to be the first to  go.  <br/>I'm down.  <br/>I wouldn't see anything wrong with it being y'all two, me,  and Amanda final four.  <br/>Yeah, how hot would that be?  <br/>You know? I'm not going to win against Ozzy, and I'm not  going to win against James. There's no way. I love them. I love having them  around, but I don't want to go up against them at the end. So I might just go  ahead and pull in Alexis and Natalie and take them with me and Amanda to the four.  Everyone else, they're dead to Everyone else, they're dead to me. me.  <br/>Oh.  <br/>Oh, my God. "Choose one player from the Malakal tribe  to sit out today's immunity challenge. The person you choose will be sent to  Exile Island, but they will be returned to their tribe's camp before  tonight's tribal council with individual immunity." Tonight's tribal  council with individual immunity? "This individual's immunity is good  for tonight's tribal council only. Circle their name on this parchment, seal  it in the envelope, and present it to Jeff at the challenge."  <br/>Wow. And so Tracy was voted out.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>We just got tree mail and found out that we have an  immunity challenge today, which is kind of shocking, because we just had an  immunity challenge yesterday. We had to pick one member of the Malakal tribe  to sit out of today's challenge and to get individual immunity at tonight's  tribal council. This is huge.  <br/>Whose name do you think they'll be circling?  <br/>"Individual immunity is good for tonight's tribal  council only. Circle their name and seal the envelope and present it to Jeff  at the challenge."  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Then we got this, like, hanging like this. And this piece  says, "Life here is like a balancing act with the other tribe trying to  knock you down."  <br/>Oh, no!  <br/>"Win this one, you're safe tonight, and it'll be your  tribe who's chowing down."  <br/>I think whoever wins the immunity challenge gets to go to  a feast, and then the other tribe has to go to tribal council.  <br/>Not both, not both.  <br/>Right, right.  <br/>So...  <br/>Who do we want to sit out?  <br/>Whoever is their best balancer.  <br/>If we go to tribal council tonight and I don't have  immunity, I'm dead. So I am hoping so much that I get some form of immunity  here and survive this tribal council and survive this tribal council tonight.  tonight. tonight.  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Airai, getting your first look  at the new Malakal tribe. Tracy voted out at the last Tracy voted out at the  last tribal council. tribal council. You guys ready to get to it?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: This morning in tree mail, you were instructed to  select one member from the other tribe to sit out of today's immunity  challenge. This person will not participate. Instead, they will go to Exile  Island with individual immunity. Here's what that means. If their tribe loses  and they have to go to tribal council, they cannot be voted out. That  immunity is good only for tonight's tribal council, only if your tribe goes  to tribal council. Make sense?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: You guys both made your selections?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: I'll come get them.  <br/>Probst: I'll come get them. To sit out of today's  challenge, Airai selected Ozzy. To sit out of the challenge, Malakal  selected-- originally, it was James. They changed it to Alexis. Ami, tell me  about that. Why the change of heart?  <br/>She seems like she could balance, and it seemed like it  was about balance, so we decided to get rid of Alexis.  <br/>Probst: Alexis, Ozzy, get your stuff. your stuff. Boat's  waiting on you. Boat's waiting on you. Right down there. All right, you guys  ready to get to today's challenge?  <br/>How about what we're playing for?  <br/>Probst: How about first you give me immunity back? How  about that? Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. On my go, one tribe  member at a time will attempt to navigate an obstacle course while members of  the other tribe attempt to knock you off by swinging heavy canvas bags. When  you reach the end, you'll grab a flag, try to make your way back. If you fall  off at any point along the way, you have to make your way back to the start and  the next person goes. First tribe to collect five flags wins. Want to know  what you're playing for?  <br/>Definitely.  <br/>Probst: Winning tribe, immunity. In addition, pizza and  beer delivered to your camp this afternoon.  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>Pizza.  <br/>Probst: Worth playing for?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Probst: Airai, you have one extra member-- sitting  somebody out. Who's it going to be?  <br/>I'm going to sit out.  <br/>Probst: Parvati, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else,  I'll give you a minute to strategize. minute to strategize. We'll get  started. We'll get started. All right, here we go. Running the course for  Airai, Eliza and Jason. Swinging the bags for Airai, Natalie and James. For  Malakal, running the course, Erik and Amanda. Swinging the bags, Ami and  Cirie. For immunity and reward in the form of pizza and beer. Survivors  ready. Go! Erik leaps across the stepping stones, makes his way across the  barrel, missing the bags. James tries to hit him, just misses. Erik and Jason  both across the first part of this course.  <br/>Come on, Erik!  <br/>Good job, Jason!  <br/>Probst: You got to get all the way back while missing  those bags. James launches and hits Erik on James launches and hits Erik on  the head, but it's not enough. the head, but it's not enough. Erik hanging  on, almost falls off, but doesn't. Nice save!  <br/>Come on, Erik!  <br/>Good job, Jason.  <br/>Probst: Jason's across for Airai with one. Erik's across.  Eliza falls. Eliza falls. Amanda falls off for Malakal. Amanda falls off for  Malakal. Erik once again leaps across the stepping stones. Nobody having any  luck with the bags yet. Erik working the balance beam. He eludes the bags. Jason  coming back with the Jason coming back with the second flag for Airai. second  flag for Airai. We are tied 1-1.  <br/>Come on, Erik, you got it.  <br/>Probst: Jason having no trouble. Airai now leads  2-1.  <br/>Come on, Eliza!  <br/>Probst: Erik coming back with that second flag.  <br/>Go, go, go.  <br/>Probst: Erik back with the second flag for Malakal. We're  tied, 2-2. Amanda hanging on. Eliza falls off. She's got to head back. Amanda  with a nice save.  <br/>Come on.  <br/>Probst: Amanda trying to tippytoe around that barrel.  Amanda takes a hard hit and Amanda takes a hard hit and survives. survives.  Amanda's halfway there.  <br/>Get him, get him, get him!  <br/>Probst: Jason right behind her. We are tied 2-2.  <br/>Come on, Amanda!  <br/>Probst: Amanda back at the balance beam. Bags being  tossed. James aiming for Amanda, just misses. Cirie just misses on Jason.  Amanda, slow going, but no trouble for Jason.  <br/>Good job, Amanda!  <br/>Probst: Amanda's across. We're tied 3-3. Erik leaps again.  Eliza's there. Eliza's got it.  <br/>Good job, girl, good job.  <br/>Probst: We are tied 3-3, neck and neck.  <br/>Just focus, Erik. Go!  <br/>Probst: Erik across the barrels, across the beam, just  misses a bag from Natalie. Eliza heading back with that Eliza heading back  with that fourth flag for Airai. fourth flag for Airai.  <br/>Get her! Get her!  <br/>Probst: Eliza back with the fourth flag. Got to get across  the stepping stones. Airai leads 4-3. Erik across. We're tied 4-4. One flag  left for both tribes.  <br/>Come on, Erik!  <br/>Probst: Erik going back out and takes a hard hit! He's  out.  <br/>Come on, Amanda!  <br/>Probst: Erik smashed hard against the platform. Amanda  falls off.  <br/>Get him, Ami!  <br/>Probst: Jason all the way to the other end of the course,  no trouble. trouble. You've got to knock Jason off. You've got to knock Jason  off. Erik's going to go again. It's not going to matter. Jason with that  fifth and final flag for Airai.  <br/>Pizza and beer! [ cheering]  <br/>Probst: Airai wins immunity and reward!  <br/>Good job, guys. Good job.  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>Oh, my God! Oh! Oh!  <br/>Probst: Airai, for the fourth straight time,  immunity.  <br/>All right.  <br/>Probst: No tribal council tonight. Nobody going home from  this tribe. Pizza and beer delivered to your camp this afternoon. Malakal,  here's what's going to happen. Ozzy will return to your camp before tribal  council. He cannot be voted for, which means one of the four of you are going  home tonight. Grab your stuff. Grab your stuff. I'll see you at tribal. I'll  see you at tribal.  <br/>Are you guys okay? Who took that really hard fall?  <br/>Erik.  <br/>Where did you hit?  <br/>My chest.  <br/>Are you okay?  <br/>No.  <br/>Let's see.  <br/>That hurt like crazy. That challenge today was rough. I  mean, that was tough without Ozzy there today. I tried my damnedest, because  that was my last real attempt, I think, that I could have. But it was not  happening. It hurts. I'm not going to lie. That was pretty bad.  <br/>I think Erik is a genuine, good person. I really wish we  would have won today, because I would have loved to have seen Erik stay. But  I don't see any way out for him right now. him right now. I don't see any way  out for him. I don't see any way out for him. [ cheering]  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Good job, team!  <br/>How long we've been dying.  <br/>Those dreams paid off.  <br/>Those dreams paid off. Dreams paid off. Dreams paid  off.  <br/>Good job.  <br/>Thank you. I'd definitely say I was the MVP today. I think  I brought back four of the five flags, and I had a great time. But right now,  I definitely feel scared about my position over here. Luckily, I hold the  hidden immunity idol. But other than that, you know, I can't really count on  any alliances. And you know, I'm just going to have to compete at 110% at  every challenge, or it could be the end of the game for me.  <br/>Good job on that challenge. Y'all were great.  <br/>Good job.  <br/>Jason and Eliza pretty much tore up that course, and we  won. I think they both kind of know they're on the outs, so they both gave it  their all at this challenge, and they saved each other. And I am so happy. I  don't think I'll be having rat for dinner tonight. Pizza party! Pizza party.  Pizza party. [ cheering] [ cheering]  <br/>Pass the beer over!  <br/>Oh, yeah! We've got a pizza party!  <br/>Thanks!  <br/>Thank you!  <br/>Well, our pizza delivery boat pulled up, and we had four  pizzas, and we also got a little basket with garlic bread and a bucket of  beer in ice. We're just... we're in heaven right now. Can't stop  smiling.  <br/>Oh, that's what I want.  <br/>I want that one.  <br/>I'm so happy.  <br/>Oh, my God. I don't... I can't do that. I'm sorry.  <br/>Leverage, leverage. No, don't pull. Give it here.  <br/>Maybe there's an opener in there.  <br/>Oh, thank you.  <br/>Cheers. Cheers.  <br/>How amazing is this?  <br/>Today was a great day.  <br/>Today was a great day.  <br/>Good day 21.  <br/>Good day 21.  <br/>So we're right here. The fourth clue basically says  that...  <br/>It's back on this island?  <br/>Well, I'm not sure. I spent hours searching this part of  the beach, but the fourth clue says...  <br/>...go back to the beginning.  <br/>...it's under a rock. I'm back at Exile with Alexis, and I  have the hidden immunity idol already, but, I mean, I'm here, so I want to  find out if somebody else found the immunity idol-- the fake one, that  is.  <br/>I feel like we're digging for buried treasure.  <br/>Yeah. Maybe this other little Maybe this other little  outcropping over here. outcropping over here. This is over your head.  <br/>See, that's what I was thinking, a tree or something like  that. Ha-ha, someone's taken the bait. Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Someone has taken  my fake hidden immunity idol. I don't know who, but it's gone. It's not here.  Who's it going to be? Who is going to be tricked by Who is going to be  tricked by Ozzy? Ozzy?  <br/>Oh, Amanda. Why can't we win?  <br/>I never lost so many times in my life.  <br/>It's been forever.  <br/>It's sad.  <br/>But at the same time, you have to remember Erik's a  gamer.  <br/>He's competitive, man.  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>I still remember when he dropped me on my freaking  head.  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>Like, he's different in challenges than he is here.  <br/>Oh, definitely.  <br/>Oh, definitely.  <br/>You know what I'm saying?  <br/>You know what I'm saying?  <br/>I want to stay in this game very badly. I've seen so many  seasons of this show. It's killing me right now that I'm this close to maybe  making the next level, making the next set of alliances that can lead me to  the end of this game. I feel like I'm on my last legs, though. I mean, all  the fans are dead in this tribe. All the favorites have the control. But I'm  trying to work with what I have, and I'm pretty desperate I have, and I'm  pretty desperate right now. right now. How well do you guys trust Ami?  <br/>Huh?  <br/>How well do you guys trust Ami?  <br/>I don't know. Why?  <br/>Because she's been trying to get something together with  Airai since probably Joel left. And when Chet was here, she wanted to go with  us to vote one of you guys. And then when it was just Tracy, me, and her, she  tried to sway one of you guys, and that didn't happen, so Tracy left. [  laughter] She's told me about different alliances that you guys have had. She  said that she was part of Yau-Man's alliance, and she said she had nowhere to  go, and that's why she came to me and Chet and Tracy. I really don't want to  hurt her, because I really like Ami a lot. I like Ami a lot. She's such a  good person. But this isn't about people anymore.  <br/>Right, right.  <br/>This is about the game.  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>And I want you guys to know that if you decide Ami, I'll  be that if you decide Ami, I'll be in with that. in with that.  <br/>Wow. You don't know who to trust here. You have Erik  fighting for his life, who will say anything right now, who will sell his  soul to the devil to stay. And then you have Ami, who has proven time and  time again that she can't be trusted-- that I can't trust her.  <br/>I'm trying to save my neck here. here. So that's why I do  whatever. So that's why I do whatever. That's all I have. Take it, leave it,  pretend it's lies, whatever, but that's everything that I've heard.  <br/>See, the problem is I don't trust Ami, but I don't trust  Erik either. So my dilemma is who do I trust So my dilemma is who do I trust  the least? the least? So I was walking down the beach, and I came back to  camp, and there's Erik just spilling the beans, just going out about every  single thing that's gone down since the swap. I don't feel like I've done  anything to hurt you, have you? I've stuck by you 100%, and I I've stuck by  you 100%, and I always will. always will. He's trying everything in his right  mind...  <br/>No, I understand. I know. And I don't blame him.  <br/>No, neither do I.  <br/>If I vote either Ami or Erik, it's going to be risky  either way. Erik probably still has his alliance with the fans, and if they  could get Eliza, that could be a problem. But it's the same thing with Ami.  She could grab Eliza and go with Jason, Natalie, and Alexis and cause  problems. So I don't know. Just with all the skittishness and all  the...  <br/>Well, you guys, I was the last one, period, to even be,  like, talked to about being with you guys. You guys didn't ever even ask  me.  <br/>I know, because we thought you were with Eliza and those  guys.  <br/>Yeah, but I was.  <br/>I know.  <br/>And then after that...  <br/>So why would we then?  <br/>Well, yeah, but since then, you guys have never come  together and really said, "Okay, Ami, we want you to be really a part of  this and totally into this; like, we're watching your back, no matter  what." I want to stick with you guys the whole way and feel like I'm  part of you guys.  <br/>Right.  <br/>But nobody has really said, "Hey, Ami, we want to  fight with you."  <br/>Well, we want to fight with you.  <br/>Okay, thanks.  <br/>We don't know Erik like we know Ami. Like, we know we  can't trust Ami, and it's almost better with the devil you know rather than  the devil you don't know. I feel like we should have, like, a group hug or  something.  <br/>Okay, good, thanks.  <br/>Okay, good, thanks.  <br/>Oh.  <br/>Oh. We just had a really good talk.  <br/>That's what I wanted, yeah.  <br/>That's not what you wanted.  <br/>That's not what I wanted, but... but...  <br/>Right.  <br/>Right. And so you...  <br/>Well opening that up to them to...  <br/>Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.  <br/>No problem. Things were looking pretty bad, and I still  think they're looking pretty bad. I don't want to give up. I don't want to  admit defeat, but it's so hard to keep going. We'll also have to see what  Ozzy has to say when he comes back from Exile. I definitely want to talk to  Ozzy about the future. I definitely want to ask him about how he feels with  his alliance and how he feels about taking me with him.  <br/>How'd it go? No way! Are you serious? Are you  serious?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I came back from Exile, and as soon as I jump off the  boat, there was Erik looking like a lost puppy dog. He came right up to me  and said, "I know it's a long shot, but I've got to tell you something  about Ami."  <br/>Ami was trying to do something with me, Tracy, and Chet.  And then it was down to Tracy and me, she was trying to sway either Cirie or  Amanda to do whatever.  <br/>So you're being totally honest that Ami was...  <br/>Yes, yes.  <br/>Did Ami try and get me out?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>I'm going to write down Ami tonight. I just want you to  know that.  <br/>All right.  <br/>And I would like you to help me, as a fellow competitor,  to stay in this game.  <br/>Okay. The way I play this game, as soon as someone makes a  move against me, that's it. I'm going to do whatever I can to get them out as  fast as I can. And that's what Ami did. Erik, on the other hand, given the  opportunity, I think he will prove trustworthy, and I'm willing to take that  chance and willing to take that chance and that risk. that risk.  <br/>And that makes sense, but... but I still think that  Ami...  <br/>We can't trust Ami at all.  <br/>No?  <br/>No.  <br/>Well...  <br/>You know what I found out from Erik? Ami was trying to get  me out. Ami's a lying little snot.  <br/>Who can we trust more, though?  <br/>Erik.  <br/>I don't think so.  <br/>You think Ami?  <br/>At least we know what Ami is capable of and what she's  here to... how she's here to play. Erik is more dangerous than he  appears.  <br/>So is Ami.  <br/>So is Ami.  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>Probst: Four times in a row. Cirie, you're clearly the  inferior tribe at this point.  <br/>It's horrible. We just can't figure out why we keep  losing. And it sucks around camp for morale for us.  <br/>Probst: Erik, interesting situation you're in right now,  because the last three people voted off have been fans. There's only one fan  left.  <br/>I know. I understand that the fans have been going, one  after another, and I understand that I could be the one tonight. I mean, I  feel hopeless. A week ago, I was happy, and to have it go this way, it  baffles me.  <br/>Probst: Ozzy, looks to me like it's favorites versus fans  still, in a lot of ways.  <br/>Yeah, alliances were made to people that you feel the most  trust, and that's how we came to be a tribe in the beginning, the favorites.  But all of a sudden, the game gets in the way, and the favorites that might  feel they're at the bottom of the pecking order start playing the fans, start  playing both sides of the spectrum, and that's when it starts getting a  little bit funky. And now I'm starting to realize that certain things are not  what they seem.  <br/>Probst: Ami, you're tearing up.  <br/>Well, I obviously know Ozzy is talking about me right  now.  <br/>Why would you think that?  <br/>Because I know Erik has been all day long saying how I've  been playing both sides and all of that.  <br/>To be honest, the day that the fans arrived, Ami said,  "I need some help. You guys are numbers."  <br/>Yeah, I could have gone with those guys the first vote--  could have. It would have been easy. We had the numbers to do it. And I  didn't. It's just now that finally I feel like I'm part of the tribe, you're  telling me that, "Whatever, I don't trust her, I don't believe  her."  <br/>How have we ever made you feel like you're not part of the  tribe? We've always been together. We've always had the plan to try and keep  us as strong as possible as...  <br/>But I haven't always felt like I'm part of the tribe. You  guys go off, and you make decisions that you don't ask me about.  <br/>When?  <br/>Like when you guys were making decisions for the first few  times with everybody else, it didn't include me. You guys made the  decisions.  <br/>I just want to know were you gunning for me with Tracy and  Erik, or were you not?  <br/>There is no way I would have ever voted for you with Tracy  and Erik, ever. I was giving them hope and letting them have a good, peaceful  camp, and there is no way I would have ever voted for you, ever, Ozzy. The  only way I would vote for you is to win the million dollars, period.  <br/>Probst: Cirie, take me through the dilemma. It's easy to  keep with what you've been doing and get rid of the next fan, and we've still  got four favorites together. Now Ami's in question. How do you make a  decision on which way to go?-- because it's a huge vote.  <br/>I think all the favorites have a mutual respect for each  other, and you know, it's like the home team. You don't want the visitors to  come in and win the game. [ sighing] I think you just have to go with your  gut feeling, what you'll believe and what you're not going to believe.  <br/>Probst: Amanda, take me through the part of you that wants  to believe Ami. Maybe Ami is telling the truth.  <br/>I think Ami is, honestly, like, a really good person.  We've gotten close. We've been a tribe for 20-some days now, and I want to  believe what she's saying.  <br/>Probst: Ozzy, give me your take on what's happening  here.  <br/>God, I really want to trust Ami. I really do. And I feel  like I have, for the most part, for the whole, entire game.  <br/>It just kills me that he says he wants to. I can't believe  that he doesn't.  <br/>Probst: Clearly, tonight's vote is about one simple  quality: trust. Erik, why should they believe your story?  <br/>I have no other option. I feel that I'm backed up against  the wall, and I said, "You know what? The truth is fine." And I  have to tell it in hopes that they would see that and say, "Yeah, Ami is  not trustworthy," or, "Ami is a threat to the tribe well-being and  to us, as individuals, after the merge." That's all I have. That's all I  have to give was that.  <br/>Probst: Ami, why should this tribe believe your  story?  <br/>I'm going to set aside all the past of where I've voted  and what I've done and all that. They know where I'm coming from. The biggest  thing is is my heart is in this. I want to fight for this tribe. I want to  stick together. I don't want to go out now. We have so much more that we can  conquer together. I want to fight as hard as I can in every challenge. I've  looked you in the eyes, and you know you can trust me. I know you know it. I  know you know it without words. And I know you do too. Erik is a really good  guy. He's doing the best he can. I have everything invested in this. I want  to keep Parvati in. I want to keep James in. I even want to keep Eliza in. I  want to be here. I swear I'll give you everything I have.  <br/>Probst: It's time to get to the vote. Ozzy has immunity  for tonight's tribal council only because he did not participate in the  challenge. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. It is time to  vote. Amanda, you're up. Amanda, you're up.  <br/>I don't even know what to say, Erik. say, Erik. You're a  good guy. You're a good guy.  <br/>Ami, you're an awesome, awesome woman. I'm sorry it had to  come to this. What can I say? What can I say? This game's hell. This game's  hell.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has the  hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.  Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will  be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. immediately. I'll read  the votes. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote, Ami. First  vote, Ami. Erik. Erik. One vote Ami, one vote Erik. One vote Ami, one vote  Erik. Ami. Ami. Two votes Ami, one vote Erik. Two votes Ami, one vote Erik.  Eighth person voted out of Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites, Ami. That's three.  That's enough. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to  bring me your torch.  <br/>You guys better start winning.  <br/>Probst: Ami, the tribe has spoken. spoken. Time for you to  go. Time for you to go. Time for you to go.  <br/>Good luck, you guys.  <br/>Good luck, you guys.  <br/>Probst: Well, tonight's vote seems to speak to the idea  that sometimes you've got to listen to your gut and act on it. Clearly, that  is what you guys did tonight. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back  to camp. Good night. Good night.

It's not the idol.  <br/>It is the idol.  <br/>It's not the idol.  <br/>Why do you say that?  <br/>Because that can't be the idol.  <br/>Why not?  <br/>Why not?  <br/>Because it's just a stick.  <br/>Because it's just a stick.  <br/>It kills me that Ozzy and Amanda didn't trust me, that I'm  not still there playing with them. The one day I finally feel like I'm part  of something, it's the day I get voted out. This game definitely plays tricks  on you. You learn a lot about yourself. Like, I really need to keep my head  up. I really need to stay strong. I'm blessed that I got to play I'm blessed  that I got to play this game twice.
