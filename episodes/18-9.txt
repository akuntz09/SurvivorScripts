<br/>Probst: Previously on Survivor:  It's a merge! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: The tribes merge. <br/>To the merge, hear, hear! <br/>Probst: And they name themselves "Forza." The old Jalapao came in  with only four members to Timbira's six. <br/>We're in control, baby. <br/>Probst: And J.T. became the  Probst: And J.T. became the target. target. <br/>Right now, J.T. needs to go. <br/>Probst: But some former Timbira members made new Timbira members made new  friends. friends. friends.

But everyone's plans were cut short when Joe was evacuated. Joe's been battling a pretty decent infection. Medical did a thorough assessment. He can't continue. <br/>What?! <br/>Probst: So, no Tribal Council. <br/>Brendan lives to see another day. Now, I don't know what's going to happen. <br/>Probst: Nine are left. <br/>Probst: Nine are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>That sucks. Joe left camp today, and it was just kind of this funk that was permeating  the camp. And we're sitting around there, looking at the fire. looking at the fire. Nobody was saying anything. Nobody was saying anything. And I just wanted to share a piece of my life with them. I wanted to show them that no matter how bad it gets in your life, there's  always something that's going to make it much that's going to make it much  worse. worse. <br/>I want to hear this story. <br/>So, I shared with the tribe one of the stories about the time that I got  caught in the Amazon and thought I was going Amazon and thought I was going  to get killed. to get killed. Now, they were probably, you know, four, four and a half know, four, four and  a half feet tall. feet tall. I paddled so hard that my hands I paddled so hard that my hands started  bleeding. started bleeding. <br/>You don't want to say, "Coach, hey, let's have a reality check here. But no one said a word. It was silent when he finished and everybody was kind of going around looking  at each other, like, "Whoa!"  How much does it cost to get a military copter to drop you in? <br/>That would be free. <br/>That would be free. <br/>How? <br/>How? <br/>Honestly, like, you know, Coach is either the new coming of Jacques Cousteau,  or he's, you know, basically the biggest fraud that is in this game. <br/>They were just, like, ecstatic that I wanted to come ecstatic that I wanted  to come down there. down there. <br/>I don't believe this guy anymore. And if I don't believe his stories, how I can believe what stories, how I can  believe what he's saying to my face? he's saying to my face?

But I am involved in a power alliance right now, uh, the alliance is Coach,  myself, Tyson, Stephen, and Debbie, so Brendan is going home. <br/>Hi, guys. <br/>I was watching you. <br/>I'm having a great day so far. <br/>What's it from? Like, where is that...? <br/>Yeah, it's called chong ran. And it's, uh, ancient Tibetan. If you do a Google search on it, you won't find it. It's only passed down verbally. You have to go there to the monastery to study it. monastery to study it. <br/>Wow. <br/>Wow. <br/>Wow. <br/>Bow and arrow pose? <br/>Bow and arrow pose? <br/>I feel like I'm in control of this game. I have the power alliance, commanding my officers, running the show, like I  was born to do. You know, if you look at it, to defeat an army, you have to cut off the head  of the dragon, which is why I nicknamed Brendan "the dragon."  Hence, my name, the "Dragonslayer." Where does Sierra fit into all  this? With the comments that she made today, Sierra is the bowel movements that  come out of the dragon. After Brendan, Sierra's got to After Brendan, Sierra's got to go. go. <br/>Worried about Joe? <br/>Yeah, I mean, I'm sure he's doing fine. I hate having him leave the game. <br/>I know. Well, you guys were such good friends, too. <br/>I know. <br/>Like, I was so happy to have met him. It was so nice to know that like, Joe was going to be here, and I was going  to have, you know, somebody that I knew I could go to with stuff. And then for that to not happen, I was so bummed. And I just like him, you know, like, he's a cool guy. <br/>He's a cool guy. He's a real cool guy. Stephen as well. Stephen's an awesome guy. <br/>Yeah, I really like him. Well, I like all you guys. I'm like, "How do I like your tribe more than I like my own?"  Are you aligned with anyone here now? <br/>Um, aligned, not so much. I've kind of stayed pretty neutral, but, you know, regardless of who I'm  talking to or whatever, the only alliance I had in this game was Joe, so...  When you break it down, you've got my original tribe, where we knew I was the  first one out. Then I have these new kids who are down in numbers and really need a fourth. But no matter how the dice rolls, I've got some room to play around. It's really nice. <br/>Things are in our favor right now. <br/>Yeah, because like I said, I like you guys more than I like my own tribe. <br/>Erinn's vote would be huge, you know, because I lost Joe. He was a huge, solid vote. But now, Taj, myself, Stephen, and Erinn could easily turn the game around. So, it's good to know if I need her, I can call on her. I know things are different from the time I got here. from the time I got here. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, you will be divided into teams of three. Each team will have one row of eight color-coded ceramic tiles. On my go, one member from each team will toss a metal ball, attempting to  knock out one of the tiles of the other two teams. When you're out of tiles, you're out of the challenge. Last team left standing wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: The winning threesome will be taken on an afternoon of whitewater  river rafting down the Rio Novo. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: This is world-class river rafting, an experience you will not soon  forget. After the rafting trip, you will have a nice picnic, sandwiches, chicken  wings, brownies. <br/>Brownies! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: In addition, the winning threesome will choose one member of either  of the two losing teams to go to Exile Island alone. A lot at stake. You guys ready to get to it? <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: We'll draw for teams and we'll get started. All right, we have our teams: Debbie, Brendan, J.T. Tyson, Taj, Coach. Stephen, Sierra, and Erinn. Here we go. First shooters, head up. Your goal is to break the tile of one of the other teams, not your own. <br/>Stephen! Stephen, man, what are you doing?! <br/>Probst: Stephen and Coach going for black. Debbie going for red. Here we go: three, two, one. Toss. Debbie knocks out a red tile. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Stephen and Coach both knock out a black tile. Black team loses two tiles in that round. <br/>Come on. Let's go. <br/>Easy, Coach. <br/>Next group. Sierra's going to go red; Tyson going after black. <br/>Why is everybody after the black team? <br/>Your team is a little stacked, I think. <br/>We're throwing underhand breaking tiles. None of us have ever done this in our lives. <br/>I have. <br/>Coach likes to have the attention. I mean, all the great stuff he's done. Sounds almost too good to be true. <br/>Probst: Here we go. Three, two, one, toss. Brendan breaks a white tile. Sierra takes out a red tile Tyson gets nothing. Black is down two tiles. Red is down two tiles. White is down one tile. The more tiles you have, the The more tiles you have, the better off you are. better off you are. Brendan breaks a white tile. J.T. with a long toss. Sierra's on fire! Connects, knocking out a white tile. Tyson wipes out a white tile. <br/>Yeah! My first one today! <br/>Probst: With that round, red is now down to one tile left. Black team, white team, each have two tiles left. We are getting down to it. Debbie going for white; Stephen and Coach going for black. Three, two, one, toss. Debbie tosses and misses. Stephen misses. Coach annihilates a black tile. Black team now down with one tile left. The red team has one tile left, and the white team has two tiles left. <br/>Finish the red off. And I'll miss, Erinn. <br/>Okay. <br/>Oh, oh, you want to send her to red?! Oh, okay. <br/>All right, well, I'll get right [indistinct]  Taj, come over there with white. Go back to white with J.T. <br/>Probst: Erinn is trying to take out the last tile for the red team. <br/>Erinn, I'm going to whip your tail. <br/>Probst: J.T. and Taj attempting to take out the last two tiles for the white team. white team. Three, two, one, toss. Three, two, one, toss. Erinn knocks out the last remaining red tile. The red team is now out of this challenge. Sierra could put the black team out of this and win it for the white team  with one toss. Three, two, one, toss. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Sierra short. Brendan takes out another white tile. Black team, white team each have one tile left. This could do it. Erinn for the white team, J.T. for the black team. Three, two, one. Toss. Erinn goes deep, just too far. J.T. just too short. <br/>Oh, I thought that was it, man. Deb, come on. <br/>Probst: Debbie and Stephen, each looking to take out the last tile of the  other team. Three, two, one, toss. Debbie, no chance. Stephen, no chance. Sierra and Brendan. Brendan looking to win it for the black team. Three, two, one. Toss. Oh! <br/>Probst: Sierra short. Brendan clips it, but not enough. That white tile is clipped, but it is still standing. <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Probst: It still counts. J.T. going to try to put the finishing touches on that white tile. Erinn would like to win it for the white team. Three, two, one, toss. <br/>Probst: Erinn with a good toss. <br/>Nope, it's not down. <br/>Probst: Erinn knocks the black tile, but it doesn't fall. It cannot get any closer than this. Both tiles have been broken. Neither one of them has fallen through. Stephen, you may not even have to hit that tile. You might just hit the wood. The vibration may knock it in. <br/>Stephen, don't do nothing crazy now. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one, toss. <br/>Oh, no! <br/>Probst: Debbie too far, Stephen too short. Big reward on the line: whitewater river rafting, nice picnic, brownies,  chicken wings, sandwiches. <br/>Oh, my God, this is a nailbiter. <br/>Probst: Here we go. Three, two, one, toss. Sierra short. Brendan knocks out the final white tile. white tile. Black team wins reward. Black team wins reward. Black team, come on over. J.T., Debbie, Brendan, nice job. Before we send you on a nice reward, you have a big decision to make. Figure out which person you are sending to Exile Island. They are going alone. They will not be choosing anybody to go with them. <br/>Stephen. <br/>Probst: Stephen, grab your stuff. <br/>Be the wizard, Stephen. Be the wizard. <br/>Probst: A map, even though you've been there before. Head back out the way you came. <br/>Sorry, Stephen. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. No, it's my pleasure. <br/>Probst: Stephen will return in time for the next immunity challenge. All right, J.T., Brendan, Debbie, nice reward. Whitewater river rafting, nice afternoon picnic. It will be a nice little break. You will head back to camp and go on your reward tomorrow. Got it. <br/>Probst: All right, guys, sadly, I got nothing for you. Grab your stuff and head back to camp. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Coach, you can, uh, leave that behind. <br/>I'm sorry. I'm so pissed off right now. <br/>I'm sorry. <br/>I wanted to get on that river in some type of raft or kayak since I got here. <br/>I mean, I expect Brendan trying to scheme. I'm not really that worried, Brendan being gone with J.T. and Debbie. Those are two of the strongest allies. So, it actually worked out well. I just hope the extra food Brendan gets isn't going to hurt our chances for  winning hurt our chances for winning immunity. immunity. <br/>Clue six: "A big wooden head is what you have here. Look in the gap that you'll find in the rear." No surprise here. Great. This is my first Exile out here alone. It's the first of anybody's Exiles out here alone, and I got the new clue to  the same idols that we know about. So, I know there's no new idol So, I know there's no new idol in the game. in the game. I'm definitely concerned about being on Exile. I haven't made fire yet at camp. I tried a few times and I failed, and I was so embarrassed I hadn't tried  again. So, I knew that by forcing myself to come out here, either I would make fire,  make food, I would make fire, make food, or I would die. or I would die. It looked like I might die. I was trying for about an hour or two to make fire, just smacking that flint  over and over again with a machete. over again with a machete. And nothing. And nothing. How about that! Damn, I can build a fire! How about that! Finally, as darkness was starting to close around me, I got a spark; it  caught; and the whole thing took. It was like giving birth to my first child. I felt so proud of that little fire that I just wanted to stay out here and  tend to it for the rest of my life. So, even though I missed out on that good lunch and a fun, relaxing, water  rafting trip, being out here and making it being out here and making it is like  winning my own reward. is like winning my own reward. <br/>Brendan, myself, and Debbie went to the reward, and we had a blast. I've actually never been able to go whitewater rafting and that's something  I've always wanted to do forever. I felt just like a little kid. <br/>A-ha! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Great job! <br/>The reward was so much fun. The pure joy that was on J.T.'s face to see how much he just soaks it up and  appreciates it. What a great soul. So sincere, so real. Like, all qualities that you want in people that surround you or at least I  do. you or at least I do. <br/>Forza! <br/>Forza! <br/>After we did, like, the best rafting ever, we came along this huge sandbar  and I knew it was our picnic. <br/>This is amazing! I've died and gone to heaven. Chips! There's chips! Oh, my God! Look at those brownies! Whoo! Oh, my God. This is the best food in the world. <br/>Oh, my God! I had a really good day. I mean, it was a lot better than I had pictured. I figured Brendan and I being together would kind of be a dull trip, but there  wasn't a dull trip, but there wasn't a dull moment at all. dull moment at all. <br/>No? <br/>About what? <br/>Just about how to, you know. <br/>Keep me in the game a little longer. <br/>Have some fun. <br/>If there's an opportunity, I damn sure will do what I can do, whatever I can. <br/>All right, yeah. I always kind of define winning in a lot of my life of saying like, I'm going  to be #1. If I take J.T. in the finals with me, he's going to beat me. I know it's crazy, but for me, winning in this game is about getting to an  outcome at the end of the game which is going to satisfy me. If he wins it, that's like me winning this game. How do I get him to the finals? I don't know. That's the next step I need to wrap my head around. Let's have some fun. <br/>I'm definitely up for it,  I'm definitely up for it, man. man. <br/>I stayed up all night. I sat in that shelter and did not sleep at all, just running through all the  different scenarios about how do I get J.T. to the finals. And at a certain point, all the pieces, like, just fell and you could see the  puzzle and how it could see the puzzle and how it needs to be put together. needs to be put together. <br/>Here's how we're gonna do it. Um, I don't think we should send Um, I don't think we should send J.T. home. J.T. home. We had the awesome time. He's such a good dude. Debbie had such a good time with him. <br/>He is. He's one of the most amazing people I have ever met in my life. <br/>I think what we should do is you, me, Taj, Stephen, J.T., take out Tyson,  Coach, and Erinn. Start taking them out. <br/>This morning, Brendan is like, "All right, here's what's going on. I really like J.T. I think J.T. deserves to be here," and I feel the same way. Like, I really respect J.T. So, we're going to try to get So, we're going to try to get Coach and Tyson. Coach and Tyson. <br/>Okay, so, I know how to do  Okay, so, I know how to do it. it. <br/>Change it? How? <br/>You, me, Stephen, J.T., and Sierra... and Sierra...  Okay. <br/>Okay. Okay, okay. <br/>And, Taj? <br/>Yes? <br/>We haven't talked...  I know, we haven't had a chance to. <br/>That's got to make you uncomfortable, but you, like, you gotta trust me. <br/>I can't describe Timbira. I really want to know what that word stands for because it could mean  "confused." Coach and Tyson want to blindside Brendan, and, um,  Brendan is trying it vote out Tyson or Coach. We haven't even had to really put any plans into action yet because they're  so busy trying to get out their own tribe members right now. We're like, "Okay, do what you gotta do and we'll come in later."  Sierra knows the plan. Yesterday, on the river trip, I talked to J.T. and I was like "J.T., I think I can save you." He's such a good  dude. <br/>I know, he is. I love him to death, and I don't want him to go. don't want him to go. <br/>No, I agree. I agree. <br/>No, I agree. I agree. <br/>No, I agree. I agree. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Stephen, We'll now bring in Stephen, returning from Exile  Island. returning from Exile Island. <br/>Welcome back, buddy. <br/>Probst: You were out there for a while on Exile this time. <br/>It was a couple of days alone, yeah, but actually, not that bad. The weather was pretty good. I had big fires both nights. I didn't get much sleep, but it was, you know, it was all right. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Probst: First things first. Tyson, hand back the necklace. <br/>It's too gaudy for me anyway. <br/>Probst: Does that mean you don't want it again? <br/>Oh, I'll probably wear it again. <br/>Probst: All right. For today's challenge, you will each be attached to a long rope that is  threaded through a series of obstacles. You'll climb over, crawl under, maneuver around these obstacles as you race  to the finish. First three to finish move on to the final round, where, once again, you will  be attached to one long rope, only this time, the obstacle is three levels  high. It will seriously complicate things. First person to finish wins immunity, guaranteed a one-in-eight shot at  winning this game. Losers, Tribal Council, where somebody will be going home. We'll draw for spots and get We'll draw for spots and get started. started. Here we go. For immunity, survivors ready? Go! There is a learning curve to this challenge. Things that will help make getting around this rope a little easier, but  there are no little easier, but there are no shortcuts. shortcuts. J.T. off to a quick start. Tyson off to a quick start.

Tyson wins immunity! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Tyson saved the day ensuring that Brendan would go home tonight. In case he plays the immunity idol, we're gonna split the votes, four for  Brendan, three for Sierra. Brendan is the dragon. I'm the dragonslayer. This is gonna be the biggest power move to date of this game, no question  about it. <br/>Probst: Tyson, come on over. <br/>Tyson! <br/>Probst: As he predicted, for the second time, Tyson has immunity once again. Tyson's safe at Tribal Council. Not the same for the rest of you. One of you going home tonight. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. <br/>Tyson won the immunity. We can't vote Tyson. So, I decided on Coach. It will be nice to have him out It will be nice to have him out of here, I  think. of here, I think. <br/>Congratulations. <br/>Thanks, dude. You were awesome. <br/>Seriously, it was a delight watching you. It was like something out of...  Dude, you need a hug, man. <br/>You need a hug. <br/>You got your fire started. <br/>I got my fire started. <br/>Oh, you were so worried. <br/>Unfortunately I spent like an hour just chopping at that flint and I made it  and it was like, it was actually one of the best moments of my life. <br/>Oh! <br/>For me, it was a big step. <br/>I'm very proud of you. <br/>We missed your poetry yesterday. I feel like I have no skills at all. all. <br/>You know what I did? <br/>You know what I did? <br/>I started this plan to eliminate Brendan days ago, but due to default, we  didn't even go to Tribal. I've already got it set up so four votes go to Brendan, three votes go to  Sierra. If Brendan gets wind of it and uses his idol, Sierra is gone. Brendan's gone in three days from that. I'd like to see him go first because I'd like three days of just bossing her  around and telling her to shut up. Probably won't win me her vote from the jury, but it would probably win me  everybody else's vote, so... so it would be a vote, so... so it would be a  win-win for me. win-win for me. <br/>What is it? <br/>Water. <br/>All right, can we just sit down real quick? <br/>Yeah. <br/>The Exile alliance hibernated for a while. Uh, it's finally going to rear its ugly head. <br/>I talked to Taj this morning. I think we go after Coach. We get us four and Taj, I had an extensive conversation with Taj this morning  about it. <br/>Okay. <br/>You guys cool? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Okay. <br/>Myself, Sierra, Taj, Stephen, and now J.T. are all voting Coach. I think that this will be one of the biggest blindsides so far in the game. Um, so, I guess I'm happy to be Um, so, I guess I'm happy to be a part of on  the good side. a part of on the good side. <br/>I thought you might. Wow, that changes everything. <br/>He said he wants me in the finals. <br/>Why would he want that? <br/>He likes me a lot. <br/>But that's crazy. <br/>I know. <br/>It would be a really strong play. We might have to seriously We might have to seriously think about it. think about it. <br/>You know what, he's crazy. He is somewhat crazy. I think that story about him being captured on the Amazon, that's just hard  to believe. <br/>That is pretty hard to believe. <br/>I mean, [indistinct] I mean, I wouldn't reckon with them son of a bitches,  don't you think? I would have come back with a damn .30-.30 Winchester. damn .30-.30 Winchester. Something, you know what I mean? Something, you know what I mean? <br/>I would definitely say we're in control of this game now. <br/>It's a big difference, you know? Jalapao came into the merge down in numbers, but before the first Tribal  Council we come to, I'm the deciding factor. It's huge. I can go with Brendan right now and get rid of Coach or I can go with Coach  and Tyson and get rid of Brendan. rid of Brendan. It's completely in my court. It's completely in my court. <br/>Clean pots and water. <br/>Clean pots and water? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm looking forward to Tribal. The old Timbira is going to go after J.T., but I'm going to take out Coach. <br/>Sierra's got that pot...  She does? <br/>I don't like misleading people, but I feel like this is the one time in life  that you're actually allowed to do it and you get a get-out-of-jail-free you  get a get-out-of-jail-free pass. pass. <br/>I'm down with that. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>Tyson. <br/>Tyson. <br/>J.T.? <br/>J.T.? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Just pass it around. <br/>Okay. <br/>Pass it around, make sure everybody knows. Everybody already pretty much knows. <br/>Sierra, you good? <br/>Yeah. Done. <br/>Done and done? Okay. Yeah, okay, cool. <br/>Brendan suspects nothing. In fact, Brendan still thinks we're going to vote J.T. off. But in reality, we're cutting the head off the dragon and sending Brendan  home, and I feel very happy about that. You know, leaders are born. I'm not saying Brendan is not a naturally born leader, but when it comes  head-to-head, we'll see tonight who really was the Chosen One. It's going to be Coach way. It's going to be Coach way. So, that's very fulfilling. So, that's very fulfilling. <br/>Probst: So, you guys have spent a little bit of time together as one tribe. Erinn, I'm guessing certain roles are emerging. Who's the person that keeps the tribe laughing? <br/>Tyson. He just always has some sort of offhanded, witty comment to make. He's kind of the class clown. <br/>Probst: J.T., who tells the best campfire stories? <br/>Uh, Coach probably tells the best campfire stories, no doubt. <br/>Probst: Taj, what's the best story Coach has told? <br/>Well, I love the Amazon story because he told us about how he was captured by  this tribe and he was beaten and he escapes and he's, like, paddling for two  days down the Amazon River to get away. It's so unbelievable. It was incredible. <br/>Probst: Coach, this really happened or this is a movie version of what you  want to have happened? <br/>I tried to actually tone it down because if I tell them, you know, that the  tribe was, you know, looking at my ass, talking about eating my ass, so,  actually, you know, when I tell these stories, I usually try to give like the  "PG-13" version of it. <br/>Probst: Coach, does it bother you that some people might question these  stories? <br/>What I've been through in my life, it's pretty fantastic. I got, you know, scars all over my body that I can point to, of the, you  know, five, six, seven, eight, life or death situations I've been through. Probst: Five, six, seven, or eight life-or-death situations? <br/>Probably more than that, I mean, if you want me to recount them I will. I've been through a hurricane. I've been attacked by a shark, had a run-in with a crocodile, got captured by  the Indian tribe; I mean, there were some very defining moments in my life  where I thought these were the last three or four seconds. So, it doesn't bother me that people wanna question that. They cannot question my integrity and my honesty. That's how I'm playing this game. That's how I play my life. <br/>Probst: From the beginning, Coach, you've talked about the numbers, sticking  together, having a strong group. Still feel confident about that? <br/>I do feel confident about tonight's vote. <br/>Probst: Tyson, how big is trust in tonight's vote? <br/>If one of the Jalapao members goes home, then I think that Timbiras stayed  loyal, and if for some reason a Timbira tribe member does go home, I think  everybody will seriously rethink, uh, their strategies. <br/>Probst: Stephen, how does that sit with you? What can you do, if anything, to change your fate? <br/>You know, in my case, I'm just hoping I have enough time to get to know more  people. I'm really glad that J.T. is over there with a much larger target on his back than I have on mine. <br/>Probst: Taj, do you think that's true? The people that are the most physically threatening at challenges are now  gonna be the biggest targets? <br/>Yeah, I definitely think so. I mean, J.T. is fast. He's a lovable person. He's like a triple threat because you just can't find anything wrong with him. <br/>Probst: Coach, you agree with that? If you're a physical threat in this game, it's time for you to go? <br/>The seven layers of heaven with the Vikings were determined on how they were  defeated in battle. I want to surround myself with warriors. <br/>Probst: So, Brendan...  Even if that means that they defeat me, I think that that's the honorable way  to play this game. <br/>Probst: Brendan, biggest physical threats going to be the first to go? <br/>It's natural to kind of want to go after the strong, but just because you're  strong doesn't mean you go deep in this game. <br/>Probst: Tyson, has there been much talk about the idol and that it's hidden,  meaning somebody might have it and nobody knows? <br/>I just assumed that everybody that's been to Exile could possibly have the  idol. And if I figure out who has it then great; if not, everybody who's been there  has it. <br/>Probst: Taj, how does that make you feel? You've been to Exile. <br/>I don't have it. <br/>Probst: Erinn, do you have it? <br/>I don't have it. <br/>Probst: Stephen, do you have it? <br/>No. <br/>Brendan, do you have it? <br/>I have it. <br/>Probst: Brendan has it. All right, at least we've cleared that up. You guys ready to get to the vote? Tyson has the individual immunity idol. I take it you're keeping it for yourself? All right, cannot vote for Tyson. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. It's time to vote. J.T., you're up. J.T., you're up. <br/>The ancient samurai used to say that if you wanted to win the war, you had to  cut off the head of the dragon. You, my friend, are the dragon, You, my friend, are the dragon, and I am the  dragonslayer. and I am the dragonslayer. <br/>This is my wizard lightning shooting you back home. shooting you back home.

So much for old tribal loyalties. This is clearly an individual game. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

I don't think you're smart enough for it. <br/>Probst: Can she save herself? <br/>You made your bed. It kills me to have this kid here asking me to throw her a bone. bone. It breaks my heart. It breaks my heart. <br/>I knew at the merge that what would happen is I'd become a big target. I didn't think it'd happen quite that quickly, um, but it kind of feels good  to blindside because I wanted to blindside someone, too. That's all part of the game. The thing that Sierra probably needs most is in my pocket right now: the  hidden immunity idol. But it doesn't matter. She'd be next, regardless, to go. go. It's just a matter of time.
