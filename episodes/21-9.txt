<br/> Jeff Probst: Previously  on Survivor: Replace your old  buffs with these new ones. You have merged. <br/>Jeff: After the  merge, Brenda and Sash were calling the shots. <br/>We're the two most  powerful people in this game. <br/>Jeff: Marty was at  the top of their hit list. <br/>Marty is somebody to  watch because he's is talking to Benry and Fabio and Dan. <br/>Hurry up, get your  bag, and we're going to walk. <br/>Jeff: Everything blew  up when NaOnka took Alina on a food-stealing mission. The tribe found out and wanted NaOnka's head. <br/>That's really uncool. <br/>Jeff: But Sash and Brenda  wanted to protect her so they offered up Alina instead. <br/>It sucks to be Alina  right now. <br/>Jeff: But Marty got  paranoid and thought he was the next to go. So at tribal council, Marty tried to save himself by throwing Jane under the  bus. <br/>You let the little  old lady from south carolina... North carolina. <br/>This lady will take  the million dollars. <br/>Jeff: Ninth person voted  out and the first member of our jury. Alina was voted out. Alina, the tribe has spoken. Now the feud between Jane and Marty has reached critical mass. 11 are left, who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Hey, you guys, hand  me your torches. Right here. <br/>Tribal was the worst. <br/>Tribal council is  where you need to vent, but I think that tonight's tribal really shook things  up. I felt really bad for Jane. Marty, he was going a little too hard on her, you know, like he's throwing  punches but she can't block. The only thing she can do is just take it and take it and take it and take it. And I think she did well, because if the shoe was on the other foot and it  was me, I would have went right back at him and hit him really, really, hard. <br/>That's just how he is. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's unbelievable. <br/>Well, wait till he  attacks you, honey. <br/>I'm sorry about that. <br/>The jackass named mr. Farty-- is gonna be his name from now on, instead of "Marty," in my  book-- is a jackass to try to attack me. I personally don't think he can beat me physically, much less mentally. I'm still going to play my game the way I'm playing it, but I think he's  grasping at straws because he knows his days are numbered. Âª âª âª Do you think it was Chase  that put my name down? Not that it really matters but it's just good to know. Do you think it was Chase, or do you think it was Holly? <br/>I think it was Holly. <br/>Okay, then, that  tells me that Chase has got maybe half a brain. It's just frustrating to play a game with people, some people that are just  stupid. I feel like I cleared the air last night. I was very, very crystal clear that I think everybody underestimates how Dangerous  Jane is in this game. But there is no question that I'm potentially in trouble here. I've got a big target on my back so I feel like I need to have a button-down  plan between now and next tribal or they will eliminate me in a heartbeat. <br/>Marty was trying to  poison everybody's opinion of me because he knows there's noose around his  neck. He's just waiting for the hatchet man to cut that rope and he's going to be  hung. I'm telling you, the man scrambles like nobody I've ever seen. I might take him to the wood shed and whip his ass. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys! All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Absolutely! <br/>Jeff: For today's  challenge, you will be randomly divided into two teams. On my go, you'll make your way through a series of obstacles working together  to collect three keys. Once you've cleared all the obstacles, you will use the three keys to open  three locks. First team to raise their flag wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: The winning  team will be taken to a beautiful spot where you will enjoy a canopy tour. You'll zipline across the treetops, experiencing Nicaragua in a whole new way. When the tour is over, you'll treat yourselves to a Survivorbarbecue: Chicken,  steak, potato chips, apple pie. <br/>Apple pie! <br/>Jeff: Soft drinks and  cold beer. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: We'll draw for  teams and get started. All right, we randomly drew for teams, and amazingly, we ended up with men  versus women. Because we have 11 people, one of you was not selected. Chase, you will not run in this challenge, but it doesn't mean that you're  out of it. You're going to choose one team to back. If you choose the right team and they win, you go on reward. Otherwise, you head back to camp with the losers. <br/>Chase! <br/>I'm going to do  something crazy and go with the girls. <br/>Jeff: Chase, take a  spot at the end of the race. All right, here we go. For reward. Survivors ready? Go! Make your way through that hay. <br/>Over, over, over! <br/>Jeff: Keep moving,  women. Don't crawl. Let's go! Fabio's out for the men. All of the women are out at once. Working together. Start on that key. <br/>Come on, Jane, get up. <br/>Go, go, Jane, get on  my back. <br/>Jeff: Fabio working  for the men, Jane for the women. Jane has it first. Fabio right behind. Working through that crawl-through. <br/>Come on, get on the  mat. <br/>Jeff: We're dead even. Go! Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Hit it! Run back and hit it again! The men are through the sticks first. Brenda is up and over and that's it. Go! That works! Go! Fabio has the second key for the men. The women still in it. <br/>Come on, Danny! <br/>Jeff: Women hoisting Jane  up. Gotta get that second key. Let's go! <br/>Get me up! <br/>Jeff: Men are working  their way through the net crawl. Dan slowing the men down. Ladies, you're still in this. Go, women, go, go, go! You're still in it. They're still on the net crawl. <br/>We're in this, come  on, barbeque, baby! <br/>Come on, Danny! <br/>Jeff: The men are  through the net crawl working for their third key. Keep moving women. Let's go, Jane. Pick it up. You've got it in you! The men have their third key and they're through the brick wall. <br/>Come on, Jane! <br/>Jeff: Jane wearing  down but not giving up. Hustle, Jane. <br/>Come on, Jane! <br/>Jeff: The men are  through the second brick wall. <br/>Come on, girls! Don't give up! <br/>Jeff: Jane hurls  herself down this challenge. <br/>Come on, Jane! <br/>Jeff: The men are now  working on their locks. Jane absolutely exhausted. <br/>They're hard to turn,  guys. <br/>Come on, girls, come  on, girls! <br/>Get up! <br/>Come on, girls! <br/>The other way. <br/>Let's go, they're  messing up, they're messing up. Let's go, finish! <br/>Jeff: The women are  not giving up, working together, NaOnka now going for the key. <br/>Jeff: The men have  one lock undone. Two locks undone. <br/>Let's go, let's go,  let's go! <br/>Jeff: Women hit the  brick wall. <br/>Come on, girls! Come on, girls! <br/>Jeff: The men win  reward! <br/>Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Barbecue! Barbecue! All right, great effort in this challenge. "Survivor" is an unpredictable game. Nobody could have ever guessed we would end up with men versus women on this  challenge. Purple kelly, what's going on? <br/>Man, I am hungry. It's just rough. <br/>She'll be okay. <br/>I'm great. I get to spend the afternoon with some awesome girls and Chase. <br/>Jeff: Chase believed  in you. <br/>That says a lot about  Chase. <br/>Jeff: So, guys, I  have a question for you. In this social game in which it is all about relationships and getting votes  at the end, is there any one guy who feels you know what? Somebody over there worked hard enough, they deserve my spot. I'm going to give it up? <br/>I don't think so,  jeff. <br/>No. I need to eat. <br/>Jeff: So, we have 11  individuals playing this game. Whatever alliances exist, they aren't existing right now, not with a barbecue  on the line. All right, men, congratulations. You are going to enjoy a fun afternoon. You're going to zipline across the treetops. When you're finished, you will have a great barbecue. <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: All right, grab  your stuff. Head out and enjoy. All right, women, in spite of really great effort, I got nothing for you. Head back to camp. Chase, you're going with them. <br/>Chase selecting to  stay with the girls, why would you ever do that? It's like watching Chase join Jane was like watching the movie "Dumb and  dumber." I don't get it. <br/>Whooo! <br/>Whooo-hooo! <br/>Let it rip, Benry! <br/>Never in a million  years did I think I'd be in Nicaragua, zipping across the jungle on a zipline. And I couldn't have asked for a better four guys to be with. It was a day for the boys. <br/>Go, Danny! <br/>Come on, Danny boy! Let it rip, Danny! Let it go! <br/>The first time flying  above the Nicaraguan jungle on the zipline, it was okay. There aren't any ziplines in brooklyn. If there are, you're a burglar. <br/>Danny, how cool was  that? <br/>Crazy. <br/>Oh, look at this one  right here. <br/>This is a good one. <br/>This is a banger. A big one. <br/>It felt incredible,  almost symbolically, to be hooked onto a zipline in midair above the jungle  enjoying a day off. It was thrilling, exhilarating, and... I felt free. Yeah, Marty! <br/>Whooo! <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>Come on, Danny boy! <br/>Whooo-hooo! <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>Wow! <br/>Whooo-hooo! <br/>Taking this thing to  the end, man. <br/>We earned it! <br/>Nice job today, man. <br/>The best part of the  barbecue is getting a little opportunity to speak to the guys about my  strategy and maybe convince them that I'm really good at this game and I can  help them in this game. The plan is set in motion. I'll vote NaOnka, flush the idol. She'll hear it, she'll know it. But you can't let that leak, Fabio, at all. It has to be NaOnka all the way. <br/>I'm going to be the  one leading that charge. <br/>And all of us with Brenda  vote for Jane. Hopefully the idol is flushed, Jane goes home, it isolates Chase, and then  you guys run it, man. <br/>Marty is a smart guy. He knows what he's doing. He came up with a pretty solid plan. If properly executed, it will definitely ruffle a few feathers. <br/>So glad we're  together, man. <br/>Me, too. <br/>The whole thing just  clicked. <br/>Me, too, buddy. <br/>What do you think Brenda  thinks of Chase? <br/>I'm guessed Brenda is  just keeping her option open. <br/>He's a bad horse to  ride. <br/>I bet he's in a bad  mood at camp and Brenda doesn't like that, man. When people panic and start to worry-- That's why I find it  hard to believe she would throw her lot in with those kooky people. <br/>Sash you have to  reassure Brenda we want her in the game. She trusts you 100%. <br/>I know she trusts me  100%. I trust her 95%. The plan Marty put forward makes perfect sense but I believe Brenda and I are  the two brightest minds out here and in the end she and I have the power to  send whoever we want home. <br/>I'm glad you're with  us. <br/>We did our best. <br/>I just want to say  one thing-- Chase showed his character today by believing in us. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Marty, you all know  how I feel about him. Sash is the only one I trust over there so... Thank you. <br/>We're glad you're  here. <br/>Chase, I don't think  he made a smart move. He should have chosen the guys. He just went with his little emotions, and he didn't want to disappoint north  carolina, Jane, and mommy figure Holly, and maybe me. So he went with the girls. Chase doesn't make smart moves. That's his problem. <br/>Isn't that crazy? The alliance picked the same rocks. <br/>And I think tomorrow  we're all in agreement about one thing-- as long as Marty is not winning  immunity tomorrow, he's going home. <br/>I really want Marty  out of here. <br/>Today was a huge  reward. It drove me crazy. I mean-- that I missed that. But I went with my gut, and I wanted to show the girls they can trust me, and  hopefully that will get me further in the game. <br/>Dan and Marty are  really, really tight. <br/>I didn't realize how  tight they were. <br/>See, and you know  after today, I'm sure they're going to try to get Sash and Brenda. <br/>Yeah, but I'm not  going to sit there and doubt Brenda because that will get her mad and we  don't want her mad. Hopefully Brenda's in. <br/>Gotta trust her. That's all you can do. <br/>Brenda. Do you think we can? Yeah. <br/>I mean, it comes down  to the next-- next vote, and Brenda and Sash are in, we get Marty out, and  we're good to go. <br/>Okay. <br/>You really think we  can trust Brenda. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I do. <br/>I mean, we made it  this far with her. <br/>Yeah. My relationship with Brenda has definitely changed. I'm not sure about Brenda. I'm not sure where her head's at right now. We've been away from each other since we did the tribal swap. We don't talk much anymore. We talked when we were at the La Flor camp but we don't talk much. That could be because she's really with Marty. You don't got to worry about Brenda. <br/>Just don't get on her  nerves. <br/>You seem really  unsure right now. Are you just thinking? <br/>Just thinking. You know, about Sash. <br/>I'd love Marty out  first. What do you think? You seem really unsure. <br/>No. <br/>You know you can  trust me. You've known you can trust me from the beginning. <br/>Chase is a worrywart. "What's going on, Brenda? Are you okay? Are you unsure? You seem unsure? I'm freaking out, I'm worried." you know, Chase is like a little baby  that's always going wah, wah. <br/>You seem really  unsure right now about everything. <br/>I don't really look  into the future that much. <br/>One of the things I  can't stand is paranoia, and Chase is too paranoid. You could be tall and you could be muscular, but, really, where's all the  alpha male power control? It's an illusion. I don't need to run around proving myself to anybody. <br/>But I told them don't  go over there irking Brenda, for real. And what did he do? Came over here and starting irking Brenda. We may have to swap you out for somebody on the other side because your  paranoia is getting to be too much. <br/>Tree mail! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Read it to us. <br/>"This next  challenge is a test of strength. That is, your memory better be strong. Know what came first and what came last or be the next to say so long." Oh, man. Immunity. <br/>It's definitely  immunity. <br/>Tree mail showed up,  so I'm hoping the Gods up there that we pray to keep the good in and triumph  over the evil. There's only one really seriously evil, diabolical person in this game right  now, and that's Marty. If he doesn't win immunity, fat lady's going to be singing. I'll tell you that much. And I'm going to be the fat woman, although I'm not fat. There's a big old target on my back right now after Marty's slanderous  outburst the other night. So anybody needs to win, except for Marty. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys! Good morning. <br/>Good morning. <br/>Good morning. <br/>Jeff: You guys ready  to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: First things  first, I will take back the two immunity necklaces, Fabio and Jane. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Once again, individual immunity is back up for grabs. Only one immunity necklace today. For today's challenge, we're going to test your memory. I'm going to show you a series of symbols. You're going to use your cube to repeat them back to me. You get it right, you move on to the next round. Last person left standing wins immunity and is guaranteed a one-in-10 shot at  the million dollars. Losers go to tribal council where someone's run at the money will come to an  end. All right, you ready to begin? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: First round,  first symbol. Ship. Musket. Anchor. Ship's wheel. Musket. Ship. All right, show me the first symbol. First symbol, everybody has ship, everybody was correct. It was a ship. Next symbol. The second symbol was a musket. Everybody got it right. Third symbol. All right, we have Jane and NaOnka both say ship's wheel. Everybody else has anchor. Correct symbol was anchor. Jane, you're out of the challenge. Naonka, you're out of the challenge. Take a spot on the bench. And with that, we lose our first two. Next symbol. Everybody has ship's wheel except Dan. Dan has coins. Correct answer is ship's wheel. Dan, you're out of the challenge. Next symbol. Holly, kelly, and Sash all say ship. Marty, Benry, Fabio, Brenda, and Chase say musket. Correct answer is musket. Holly's out of the challenge. Purple kelly is out of the challenge. Sash, out of the challenge. All right, next symbol. Everybody says ship. Everybody got it right. And we're down to five. We move on to the next round. Musket. Ship. Coins. Anchor. Dagger. Musket. Ship's wheel. Here we go. Show me the first symbol. Everybody says musket. Everybody is right. Next symbol. Everybody says ship, except for Fabio, who says anchor. Correct answer was ship. Fabio's out of the challenge. Take a spot on the bench. We are down to four. Next symbol. Everybody says coins except for Chase. Chase says musket. Hold on, brother. You don't know if you're right. Chase, you're wrong. Correct answer was coins. Chase is out of the challenge. We are down to Marty, Benry, and Brenda. Next symbol. Marty and Brenda both say anchor. Benry says dagger. The symbol was anchor. Benry, you're out of the challenge. We have our final two. Marty and Brenda. For immunity. Have not been the best of friends in this game so far. <br/>Not true. <br/>Jeff: I'm just saying  what I see. Next symbol. Marty and Brenda both say dagger. You are both right. Next symbol. <br/>Brenda got it. Brenda got it. <br/>Jeff: Marty shows the  ship's wheel, Brenda shows musket. And you're smiling. Are you sure you're right? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: You are right. Marty's wrong. Brenda wins individual immunity. Congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Brenda is safe  at tonight's vote, cannot be voted out. As for the rest of you, somebody going home. Should be an interesting afternoon. I'll see you at tribal. Congratulations. Head on back to camp. <br/>Toss a bunch down. <br/>Hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Think that plan's gonna work? <br/>Naonka, and then  blindsiding Jane? I think the sooner we can get rid of her the better. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm trying to win a  million dollars, you know. <br/>We got to make sure NaOnka  flushes that idol tonight. We gotta, like, let it leak that she's... That we were... You and I should just  lay low and say we're voting NaOnka... And play stupid. <br/>I know, dude. I hate playing stupid so much, but it's, like, the smartest thing to do right  now. <br/>Yeah, it's easy. <br/>It's real easy. That's the greatest thing about this plan. I don't really have to do a whole lot, and that's a big part of this game, is  laying low. You know, I call it being cool. Whatever. Just not ticking people off, and, you know, it's a good strategy as far as  I'm concerned, you know? <br/>Who do you all think? <br/>I think go with your  head, not your heart. <br/>I'm just going with  you all. <br/>I think it's gonna be  NaOnka. I haven't heard from everybody, but I'm pretty sure that's gonna be the  consensus. Let me put it to you this way, man. If somebody walked into your coach's office, stole the playbook, went into  your locker room, stole every wallet out of your players and they gave it to  the other team and then lied to you guys, is that a player that you would  want to play next to? Is that a linebacker you would want to play next to? <br/>No. <br/>I don't think so. <br/>I'll do it. <br/>I'm always worried  when I go to tribal. I know that the other alliances are gonna go for me because I took the flower. But I'm straight from south central l.A. I have some street smarts and I always follow my intuition. But keep in mind that I do have an immunity idol, and if I have to use it for  myself to save myself, I will. <br/>He said they're  voting NaOnka. I think their plan is to vote NaOnka and then actually blindside Jane. <br/>So who are you voting  for? <br/>I'm voting for Marty. <br/>How about Brenda? <br/>I haven't talked to  her. <br/>My two cents, and  then I won't bother you again for the rest of the day. Has Sash talked to you at all yet? <br/>No, not yet. <br/>No? Okay. <br/>What's the plan? Did Sasha just tell me? <br/>Sash's plan was,  yeah, he'll lay out the whole thing. Was basically everyone say NaOnka, NaOnka, NaOnka, flush the idol and vote Jane  off. Blindside Jane. That's what everyone... That's what Sash proposed, and everyone seems to be  on board with that. At least, like, five, or whoever all of us voted last time. <br/>Okay. What Marty said is absolutely true. Jane is a huge threat, and if anybody's thinking of going with her to the  final or letting her even get close is a fool, 'cause she would win. <br/>I always pack my bags  as if I might go. <br/>I know, me, too. <br/>And I'm not going to,  I mean, I'm going to tonight. Hopefully that's not the case, all right? <br/>I agreed to it. We went along with the plan, but Marty is not running the camp. Sash and I are running the camp. <br/>Did Marty fill you in  on his plan? <br/>Yeah. What's your plan? <br/>Huh? <br/>What's your plan? <br/>My plan is whatever  your plan is. <br/>All right, good. <br/>I assumed go ahead  with... Telling everybody NaOnka. <br/>Naonka. I thought all the women wanted Marty gone. <br/>Marty gone. They do. <br/>They want him out so  bad, that I feel like... Just like a thorn in their side. <br/>Just don't... Here, let's chat for  a second. <br/>I just don't like how  all of a sudden, you know, Jane and Holly and Chase's clique are demanding  things. <br/>Right. Yeah. You're right. It's a slippery slope. <br/>Okay, so if we take  out Marty, I'm fine with whoever, right. <br/>Just personally for  me, I would rather that Marty stay one or two times longer at least because I  think he's a good cook. <br/>Right. <br/>I know, he tells me  everything. <br/>And he tells us  everything. <br/>Yeah. So, ideally, like, just from a personal standpoint, I wouldn't want Marty to  go home tonight. <br/>Me, neither. <br/>Sash and I are kind  of like the swing vote. The Marty crew thinks we're with them to blindside Jane and have NaOnka flush  out her idol. And then the Jane-Chase crew thinks we're with them to vote out Marty. So tonight is really gonna show who we really are with. I like to be in charge, and I kind of am in charge right now. So when it comes down to it, it's really whatever Sash and I want. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring  in the first member of our jury. Alina, voted out at the last tribal council. So let's talk about the reward challenge. We ended up with this random split of men versus women. Jane, you guys were heavily outmatched in terms of physical strength, and yet  you put up a great effort. <br/>The hardest thing was  when we hit the bamboo, it was like we bounced off, and then when we hit the  brick wall, we bounced off even harder. <br/>Jeff: Sash, on the  flip side, the guys win, you get this great reward. Was there a little bonding time or was it all strategy? <br/>There was a lot of  bonding time. I think the five of us not only showed our desire to work as a group and also  give us a little time away from the camp to strategize and decide some of the  next steps. <br/>Jeff: Fabio, the  downside of being with all the guys out enjoying the reward is you got five  women back at camp none too pleased about it. <br/>Yeah, I'm sure that  strategizing definitely happened, and it was the five girls plus Chase, so  that's six people. I mean, there's a lot of different angles here. I was just stoked that we were eating while we were doing it. <br/>Jeff: Marty, last  tribal council you were pretty clear about Jane is somebody you need to watch  out for and you probably ought to get rid of. Felt like you might have put a target on your back. <br/>She's an incredible  threat. Which is, again, I'll say it, I'm honest, it's a compliment to Jane, and  maybe you take some risk in doing that. I feel fairly comfortable, but my bags are packed. <br/>Jeff: Brenda, how  much time did you spend thinking about what Marty said about Jane? <br/>You can't lie against  that and say she's not a threat. It's true. I mean, take someone like NaOnka who's, like, "Troublemaker," or  take someone like Jane who keeps feeding us fish, who would you like to take  to the end? I think it's a no-brainer, depending on how you play the game. <br/>Jeff: So, Jane, you  are a likable person, and in some game that would be rewarded. Sometimes in Survivor, you get penalized. <br/>Well, you always have  a target on your back. Me and Marty got off to a bad start. I stepped on his toes, he stepped on mine. I probably should have kept my mouth shut. So I think I have a target on my back, yeah. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka, at the  last tribal council we talked about the fact that you had an idea to steal  some of the food from the merge feast. Why are you rubbing your head already? <br/>I don't, jeff. Go ahead. <br/>Jeff: It came up at  tribal council, NaOnka. You survived that vote. In fact, it didn't seem to hurt you at all. <br/>It's gonna be something  that's gonna always be talked about 'cause it was stupid, you know? And I'm here. I'm happy to be here. I don't want to talk about it anymore, jeff, but I know it's gonna be brought  up. <br/>It has not sit well. The way it was dealt with at the last tribal was as if it was trivial. To lie and to take food-- there is no bigger sin. I mean, I know there were priorities here and some of us had to go with the  flow, but absolutely not trivial, not in any way. <br/>Jeff, I'm not perfect. I'm a humanitarian. I'm a human. I screw up. Marty screws up, too. But I don't like him, he don't like me. So it is what it is. <br/>Jeff: So you're mad  at Marty 'cause he strategizes? <br/>I don't like him! I just don't. His hair, his walk sucks. You know, I can see through Marty. <br/>Like Marty said, we... Fabio, wait a minute. You know, I can't hate on his game, but I'm competing against Marty. Put it in terms of a track meet: He's in lane 5 and I'm in lane 4. I'm gonna try to go a little faster, but at the same time, before I go, you  know, I'm gonna try to give myself fight. I'm gonna try to just whoo-whoo-whoo, you know? Try to scare him a little bit, you know? 'cause that's just what you do. <br/>I don't follow that,  but, whatever. <br/>Jeff: Is it working, Marty? <br/>No. I mean, this game is about instincts, and I had a gut instinct that said  that's what this person is all about. <br/>Thank you, thank you. <br/>And guess what? She is a liar and a cheat and a steal. <br/>Well, my daddy is in  inglewood, california, and I don't have nothing to prove to Marty. <br/>He's not gonna be proud  of you, sister. <br/>Oh, he is because I'm  here and you probably won't be. [light laughter] Jeff: Fabio, you love  this. <br/>It's crazy. Like, everything she just talked about doesn't really make sense to me. <br/>I want you guys to  know I'm not dumb. You know, I made a stupid move, but I'm very far from stupid, okay? <br/>And by the way, just  saying you're sorry, you still did it in the first place. <br/>Okay, well, it's done. <br/>Okay, then nothing  else needs to be said about it. You're proving our point. <br/>Okay, you guys keep  talking about the damn flour. What the ... Would you want me to do? You guys can bash on me all you want. I'm not gonna lose any sleep because I damn sure don't get sleep as it. <br/>You might tonight. <br/>And you might, too, Marty. <br/>Always a possibility. <br/>Both: Mm-hmm. <br/>This is crazy! <br/>They think that  they're intimidating me right now, and they're not. <br/>Well, something's  getting under your skin, 'cause you're going off. <br/>I love talking. I go off on you all the time. This is not gonna change who I am. But it's kind of funny to me that I'm getting pounded on right now. But you know what? This is gonna happen. The guys bonded. I know they talked so much ... About me yesterday. I just know. But do I care? <br/>Does it occur to you  that people are saying the same thing about you? They're getting sick of this. <br/>It seems like you  care more than I care. <br/>Well, it's irritating  me. <br/>Well, it irritates  the ... Out of me, too. This is just who I am. So whoever don't like it, 'cause I am me. [Marty chuckles] ... You, too. [laughter] Jeff: Okay, I gotta  say, I'm-I'm... God, NaOnka... I think I'm speechless that you can go off  like this, tribal after tribal, and still be in this game. Tells me I should be looking for you to be sitting here at the final. <br/>Somebody wants to  take me because I'm being a bitch, or I'm just embarrassing myself, if you  will. Well, then, so be it. But I'm not putting on a show. This is who I am. This is what I've been for 27 years. So if you don't like it, then you don't like it. <br/>Jeff: All right, it  is time to get to the vote. Brenda, you have individual immunity. I assume you're keeping it. Cannot vote for Brenda. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Dan, you're up. <br/>You are a disgrace to  every man who calls himself a father. There's no way in heck I would allow my child or my grandchild to come play  with your children, plain and simple. <br/>Y'all's catfishing  trip has been terminated, 'cause y'all messed with the wrong gator, missy. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally  the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Jane. Marty. Jane. Jane. That's three votes Jane. Jane. Four votes Jane, one vote Marty. Marty. Two votes Marty. Marty. That's four votes Jane, three votes Marty. Marty. We're tied. Four votes Jane, four votes Marty. That's five votes Marty. Four votes Jane. Tenth person voted out and the second member of our jury, Marty. That's six. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Marty, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Jeff: Well, based on  the vote, it's clear you are no longer making decisions as a group, and this  is where it gets really interesting and very complicated. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Next time on Survivor: Oh, my God! This is un-freaking-believable. <br/>Words can't explain. I don't know what to say. <br/>I don't know what to  say. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God, you guys. I'm gonna cry. <br/>I am... Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>This is a day from  hell. <br/>I wouldn't change a  thing I did to my game. There's always gonna be a risk, and it caught me tonight. It's always frustrating to lose, but I was not frustrated by anything other  than there weren't enough people really playing the game, but obviously there  were enough playing the game tonight. I didn't see it coming. Otherwise, I wouldn't be sitting here right now. It sucks not to be in the game, absolutely sucks.
