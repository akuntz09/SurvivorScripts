<br/> Jeff: Previously on Survivor. Drop your buffs. We are switching tribes. After a surprise switch, the young and old were combined, but on each tribe,  the young adopted a feisty older mom to get the upper hand. <br/>I love your energy. <br/>Jeff: The Espada  youth picked up Holly. <br/>100% I'm on board. <br/>Jeff: And the La Flor  kids picked up Jane. <br/>I'm as thick as  peanut butter and jelly with the younger La Flor tribe. <br/>Jeff: That left  everyone else north of 40 out in the cold. <br/>We've been dealt a  very bad hand. <br/>Jeff: Then an even  bigger surprise sent both tribes reeling. Both tribes are going to tribal council. Both tribes will vote somebody out of this game. At La Flor, Brenda and Sash were in complete control. They wanted to flush out Marty's hidden immunity idol and blind-side Kelly B. <br/>If everything goes  according to plan, we'll be able to kill a couple birds with one stone. <br/>Jeff: At tribal  council, Sash and Brenda were sure that Marty would play his idol. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. But he shocked them by holding on to it. Marty's gamble paid off, because he kept his idol and Kelly B. Went home. Kelly b., the tribe has spoken. Now Marty and his ally Jill are two against five. At the Espada tribal council, the youth had to decide between Yve, whose  strength could help them in challenges, or Dan, who, because of his bad knee,  would never be a threat. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. In the end, Yve's strength was her undoing. Yve, the tribe has spoken. 13 are left-- who will be voted out tonight? [ã    \crowingã    ] Oh...! What a day. <br/>13 left. <br/>Thank you, honey. Thank you. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>All right, I need a... We love you, Dan. <br/>They used to call  john gotti "The teflon don," because every time they'd try and get  him on something, it could never stick. So I feel like teflon Dan. <br/>At tribal council, we  discussed the original plan and vote Yve out tonight, but I'm a little bit  worried about Dan's performance. It'll definitely be a hard pill to swallow if Dan costs us the challenges. But we've made our decisions, we've made our beds, and we've got to lay in it. <br/>Alina is strong and  she's very smart. From day one, she had these eyes that can just see straight through you. I never trusted her at all. So we need to get Alina out next. And that's for sure. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>All right? <br/>Okay. <br/>Could I just say, wow! Wow! <br/>We would've gone with  whatever you guys would have said. <br/>We wanted to flush  the idol, was the plan but... Why any votes on me? What were the votes on me? What was that? <br/>You have the idol. <br/>You got to have big,  big cajones to pull the move that I pulled tonight, which is, I did not play  the immunity idol. I sensed that you guys wanted to flush the idol, but something in my gut said  that that wasn't totally bull ... So... I kept that immunity idol in my  pocket, and I debated long and hard, and something told me hang on to it, and  I was right. I also need to get to the bottom of Jane. Obviously, Jane voted for me tonight, so that's going to have to be dealt  with. I'm just sitting here seething about Jane, actually. I have never lied to her once, I have never misled her, I've never voted for  her. She turned on me. She's a desperate one and she has been from the beginning, and she's got to  go. <br/>She's next. <br/>She's pissing me off. <br/>Hey, the one thing I  wanted to say after last night to you is... Actually, like, three things. One is... I have never, ever lied to you. Unless you tell me right now you think I've lied about something, I'll set it  straight right now. <br/>I don't think you've  lied. <br/>I have never... I  have never, ever once lied to you. I've never misrepresented myself to you in this game, not even once. I have never written your name down, and I have never, ever suggested that  your name should go down. They all told us you were going, but when I saw everything turn, that's why I  turned to you and said, "Vote for Brenda," 'cause I was, like, this  whole thing is going haywire. I didn't know where it was going. I felt like they had turned on us. So I'm not really clear on what all their strategy was. I think they wanted to flush the idol out. Two, they wanted to get rid of Kelly B., but they were worried that Kelly B. Had maybe come and talked to us and that we would use Kelly B. To flip on them. <br/>Be a foursome. <br/>Right. <br/>And we had no idea, I  never, ever had a clue. <br/>I never had a clue. Not an iota. <br/>All right, well, I  want to know that, 'cause I don't think you voted for Brenda and I think you  wrote my name down last night, so... [ã     \laughingã    ] You did? <br/>Yeah, I was, like,  "I have never written your name down, ever." Kelly b. Going home buys Marty and I another three days here. I'm hoping that Jane will be next, but Marty and I are really, like,  scrambling around from behind the eight ball to try and stay here. I don't know if it's going to work. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys! La flor getting your first look at the new Espada tribe. Yve voted out the last tribal council. Guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: For today's  challenge, one member of each tribe will be your defender. They'll be standing on a perch in the water, while, one at a time, members of  the other tribe leap off a platform and attempt to throw a ball past the  defender into the net. Each time you get a ball in the net, you score a point for your tribe. First tribe to score five points wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Tomorrow  morning the winning tribe will enjoy a Nicaraguan farm experience. That includes a little horseback riding and the making of a fresh breakfast  with tortillas... Eggs, cheese, and fresh milk that you guys will collect  from the cow yourselves. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes! <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: All right, La  Flor, you have one extra member, sitting one person out. Cannot sit out the same person in back-to-back challenges. Who's it going to be? <br/>Jane. <br/>Jeff: Jane, take a  spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize and decide who your  defender's going to be. We'll get started. Okay, we have our two defenders. Fabio for La Flor, Chase for Espada. Espada won the rock, paper, scissors. They're up first. Here we go. Naonka taking on Fabio. Looking for the first point in this game. When you're ready. Espada scores! Espada leads one-zip. <br/>You got a piece of  it, Fabio, you got a piece of it, man. <br/>Jeff: Next round, it  is Jill for La Flor taking on Chase. Jill looking to tie it up. And she does! We are tied one-one. Benry now up for Espada. Going up against Fabio. Benry could put Espada ahead. Benry scores for Espada with a double fake-out! <br/>That's a good move,  guys. Remember that one. <br/>Jeff: Espada leads  two-one. We are playing to five. It is Marty from La Flor going up against Chase. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: Oh, Marty! Throws hard... And hits Chase in the spot no guy wants to be hit. No score for La Flor. Up for Espada, Holly. Going up against Fabio. Nice deflection from Fabio. No score that round. Espada leads two-one. Next round, it is Purple Kelly up for La Flor taking on Chase. Purple Kelly Scores over Chase! We are tied two-two! Next round, it is Dan taking on Fabio. No score for Espada. Dan, it will not count if you throw it from the line and then jump. <br/>He can't jump, either. <br/>Jeff: Next round, Sash  is up for La Flor. Chase back in the water for Espada. <br/>Come on, Chase,  you're a wall. <br/>Come on, Sash! <br/>Jeff: Oh! Just misses! No score. Next round, it is Alina for Espada going up against Fabio. Alina launches one right over Fabio! Espada now leads three-two. <br/>Great job, girl. <br/>Beautiful. <br/>It is Brenda from La  Flor taking on Chase from Espada. Big reward on the line. <br/>Come on, Brenda! <br/>Jeff: Brenda up and  over Chase, but just misses. No score for La Flor. <br/>Just missed. <br/>Jeff: Espada leads  three-two. Fabio back in the water. <br/>Almost rolled in, Brenda. Hit the bottom and almost went in. <br/>Jeff: Fabio, what are  you doing right now? <br/>I'm getting on the  pedestal, jeff. <br/>Jeff: What were you  doing? <br/>I was using the  restroom. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: In the pool? <br/>The water's so dirty  anyways. Look at it. I mean, doesn't everybody pee in the pool? <br/>Jeff: I don't know,  does everybody pee in the pool? <br/>No. <br/>No! <br/>I got to concentrate,  okay? You can't concentrate when you gotta pee. <br/>Fabio is fully  relieved now. He is ready to defend against NaOnka. <br/>Come on, man. <br/>Come on, Fabio. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka scores  for Espada! Espada leads four-two! Next round, it is Jill from La Flor taking on Chase. Jill needs to score here for La Flor. And she does! La flor scores. It is now three-four. Benry up for Espada. Going up against Fabio. Espada leads four-three. We are playing to five. You score here, Benry, it's over. Benry scores for Espada! Espada wins reward! <br/>Yes! Yes! Yes! <br/>What a shot! <br/>I love you, dude! <br/>Jeff: All right, Espada,  congratulations. Tomorrow morning, nice reward. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. <br/>Man, I love horseback  riding, too. <br/>Me, too! <br/>Jeff: La Flor, nice  effort, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. <br/>Reward was for a  horseback ride and breakfast, and... You get to milk your own milk, I guess. I don't know if that makes sense. You get to milk your own milk, and... That sounds amazing. We should have won. And we should be going, 'cause that is amazing. <br/>We lost the reward,  but it makes you get up and do things and keep going, and the word  "Quit" is not in my vocabulary. I mean, I go at it all day long. I'm a farmer girl and farmer girls have a strong heart and a strong will. I can do a whole lot more than Marty and Jill ever thought I could do, so I'm  trying to stay in the good graces of the four tribe members that I have made  friends with over at the La Flor team. So, you know, they can lounge around, that's okay, as long as they feel I'm  important. <br/>I don't care what they  do right now. I'm not going to tell them to get off their... Lazy little asses. Let them sleep. Let them sleep, let them relax. As long as we win challenges, that's all I care about. <br/>You know, she's a  master fisher woman, so hopefully... The older people who  came over from Espada can work their butts off, feed me all day long, and,  you know, they'll help me get stronger, so I love it. Um... You know, I get to stay home all day, relax, eat the fruits of their  labor, while they go out, they work hard. You know, I give them a lot of credit, but, you know, this is a game and, you  know, long run... For me, who stays in this game isn't a matter of how hard  you work around camp, it's about how loyal you are to me. <br/>Hopefully... Fingers  crossed, we'll get fish today. <br/>We won reward and we  showed up, and... It was unbelievable. I mean, I grew up on a horse farm in florida, and since my dad passed away,  we stopped having any horses in our barn, and that was just amazing for me,  all the emotions and everything. You get a lot of time to reflect on... Stuff that you missed, and I really,  really miss my dad. Just being here, the first reward that I get was being able to spend it on a  horse, which was just unbelievable, 'cause it just reminded me, like, God,  he's just here, he's with me. And it was just an unbelievable feeling, 'cause... You know, I miss my dad,  and... Hey, that was awesome! <br/>Yeah! <br/>That's why we're  gonna keep winning. [ã    \cow moosã    ] Welcome to our farm. First thing we're going to do is milk the cow. It's really easy, but probably you haven't tried before. <br/>Never. <br/>Okay, what you do is,  press on the top, and then you squeeze down. So, who want to try first? <br/>Here goes nothing. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Come on, Dan! <br/>I think I was... I  think I went out on a date with her. [laughter][ã    \cow moosã    ] Whoa! <br/>I got it! <br/>All right, nay, give  it a shot. <br/>Let's see what you  got, nay. Okay, here you go. <br/>Oh, wow, they feel so  swollen. <br/>Whoa, nay. [ã    \indistinct talking,  laughingã    ] You can do it, nay. You can do it. <br/>Nay's not a farm girl. <br/>Let me do it with  your hand. [ã    \cheeringã    ] I am not a farm person. I don't milk animals. I don't play with animals' nipples trying to get milk out. Okay, I'm over it. But it was okay, 'cause I could say that I touched a cow's nipple. [ã    \cow moosã    ] Yes! It worked! Whoo! He who doesn't fish with me shouldn't get all the riches. [ã    \laughsã    ] I've been up since 5:30, working all  day to catch fish. I'm starving. I want me a fish. I'm gonna eat this one I just caught. I think I deserve it. [ã    \laughsã    ] but if I'm going to cook this sucker, I  got to go hide in the woods. I don't know how safe that is at the moment, but I'm going to try. [ã    \monkeys gruntingã    ] They're going to be  wondering where I'm at. Never cooked a catfish like this, but I'm starving. And I think, out of all the fish that I've caught, I deserve this one. And I'm not gonna take him back to camp and argue with anybody. You know, they sat me out on the last challenge, and they lost the food  reward. Well, that's my food reward. [ã    \laughsã    ] for all my hard work. This is the first thing I've done behind anybody's back, other than vote for Marty. [ã    \laughsã    ] but I'm going to dig into this thing  right now and see... If it is done, and I don't care if it's black. Bon appetit! [ã    \laughsã    ] [ã     \cow moosã    ] Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, gosh! <br/>Unbelievable! <br/>When I saw the food  that was prepared on the table... This is what I've been waiting for. ...Not eating for 16 days and seeing food, I actually started to shake. Watermelon, I just love it. This can't be happening. <br/>Alina and Chase,  you've both called our camp home. <br/>Have we? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>It's home. <br/>It's home. <br/>We take for granted  sitting down and having a meal together. We've been together for how many days, and the six of us sitting down and  being so appreciative of a meal, it was... It became very emotional for a lot  of us. <br/>[ã    \cryingã     ]: Incredible. After 17 days of not eating and not being with family or anything, I mean... We're kicking ass,  y'all. We're doing this, man, we're doing this. <br/>Oh, God... Alina's so grimy,  she's so grimy and so sneaky. I think she got emotional because she's trying to keep herself in the game. But I can put on a show, just like Alina. I have been playing a role. We have been getting close, you know? This is all a part of my plan. Next thing you know, you're going to be walking away and your torch is put  out. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys! All right, first things first. I will take back the individual immunity necklaces. Thank you. Individual immunity no more. Once again tribal immunity is back up for grabs. Let's get to today's challenge. Standing at the top of a tower, two members of each tribe will roll cannon  balls down a long, steep chute while four other members will use ropes in an  attempt to aim the chute, trying to break one of the other tribe's tiles. First tribe to break all five of the other tribe's tiles wins immunity and is  safe in this game. Losers go to tribal council, where the eighth person will be voted out of the  game. La flor, you have one extra person. Cannot sit out the same person in back-to-back challenges. Jane sat out the last challenge. Who's it going to be? <br/>I'm going to sit out,  jeff. <br/>Jeff: Sash gonna sit  out. Take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize, and we'll get started. Up top for Espada: Benry and Alina. On the ropes for Espada: Chase, Holly, NaOnka and Dan. Up top for La Flor: Brenda and Purple Kelly. On the ropes: Jill, Marty, Jane, Fabio. Here we go. <br/>All right, pull it up. Watch out. All right, hold on, hold on. <br/>Lower it down, lower  it down. <br/>Chase and Holly, a  little lower. <br/>Jeff: Takes some work  to move these ropes around. <br/>Marty and Jill, up,  please. Everyone... Okay, stop. Okay, nay and Dan, pull a little more. <br/>Too much. <br/>Right there, right  there. <br/>Right there. <br/>Jeff: There are three  levels you can shoot from in this challenge. <br/>All right. <br/>Do this one. <br/>Jeff: Espada has it  lined up. Where's Benry going to drop the ball? He's moving down. Benry with one of those small cannonballs. There are two sizes. Ball is en route. Just short. Kelly lets it go. And it connects! La flor takes an early lead one-zip. <br/>Nay, like, uh, toot! Boom. <br/>Jill and Marty, pull  more, please. Pull more. <br/>That looks super good. <br/>All right, I think a  big one might hit that. <br/>Jeff: Alina ready with  Espada's second shot. <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: And it connects! Just misses. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: We are tied  one-one. <br/>Naonka and Dan, give  a nice little pull. A nice one. Let's go for that other big boy. <br/>Marty and Jill, pull. Keep pulling. Okay, stop. <br/>It's, like, two feet  lower than it was. <br/>It's two feet lower  than that last shot. I think we should go up a little bit. <br/>Okay. <br/>All right, I think  that might be perfect. <br/>Jeff: Espada ready. Benry lets it loose. And he connects! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Jeff: Purple Kelly  lets it fly. Just misses. Espada leads two-one. <br/>You guys, I knew it. <br/>It has to be lower. <br/>It has to be lower. <br/>Chase and Holly, drop  a little. <br/>Drop. <br/>Oh! You all right? <br/>Are you making it  lower? <br/>Yeah, it's, like, six  inches, eight inches. <br/>Do it more. <br/>Go down the level  with the big ball. Trust me. <br/>I think we should  pull up a little bit. <br/>Fabio, come on, last  time I listened to you. <br/>Jeff: Alina ready for  Espada. She's moved down to the second level. <br/>Drop. <br/>Jeff: Going for a  closer target. <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: And she  connects! <br/>Let's go, Brenda! <br/>Jeff: Brenda hoping  to score for La Flor. Just misses. Espada now leads three-one. <br/>We need to go back to  that first one we tried, because we see where the first one hit. <br/>We got little balls. <br/>I know. I know, but... We got little balls. <br/>Are we good? Will you tell us? <br/>It was right on, it  was just too short, so we're going to get more momentum up here. <br/>Jeff: Benry moving  down to the second level for Espada's next shot. <br/>Come on, Benry! <br/>Come on, ben! <br/>Jeff: Benry releases. <br/>Oh, baby! Whoo-hoo-hoo! <br/>Jeff: And it connects! <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>Let's go, guys. <br/>Jeff: Brenda ready  for La Flor. She releases. And just misses. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Espada now  leads four-one. There are five tiles to break. <br/>I need nay and Dan to  pull. <br/>Pull up. Right there. <br/>You guys have got to  both talk about it up there. <br/>We are. We're both talking about it up here. <br/>Feeling that, baby. <br/>Yeah? <br/>Yep let it go. <br/>Jeff: Espada could  win it with this. <br/>Oh! Just barely. Don't move. <br/>Jeff: Just short. La flor still alive. La flor needs to score here, trailing four-one. <br/>I'm going to let it  go. <br/>Jeff: Down on the  third level with the bigger ball. And it worked-- La Flor scores! La flor now has two, Espada at four. <br/>You want to go with  the big one? <br/>Let's try a big one. <br/>Go grab a big one. <br/>How does it look from  there if I launch a big one from here? Does it look good? <br/>Jeff: Espada going to  change balls, going with the bigger cannonball. A lot of strategy. <br/>The aim is perfect,  guys, but we're overshooting. <br/>When I went down  there, though, it was super short. <br/>It's getting hard  down here. <br/>Jeff: Espada could  win it with this toss. <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: And they do! <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>Jeff: Espada wins  immunity! <br/>I should be a pirate! <br/>Yes! <br/>I really felt like we  had that. <br/>Me, too. <br/>Jeff: Espada,  congratulations. Back-to-back wins, Alina. Got to feel good. <br/>It feels absolutely  amazing. <br/>Jeff: Nobody going  home from Espada. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. Enjoy the night off. <br/>Jeff: La Flor, tribal  council tonight. The eighth person will be voted out of this game. You have the afternoon to figure out who that's going to be. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you at tribal. <br/>Losing immunity  today, for me, means that we go to tribal council, and the way things are  shaping up, it looks like the remaining La Flor members want Marty or I gone,  and being that he has the immunity idol, it will probably be me. <br/>Fabio. <br/>Fabio. <br/>Fabs. Who do you want to go tonight? <br/>We got to split... We  got to put three on Marty, two on Jill, make Marty play the idol, Jill and  whoever they vote for tie... Which would mean a  tie. <br/>And then we'll all  vote Jill out. <br/>Okay, Jane needs her  satisfaction of voting for Marty, I think. <br/>Jane, are you going  to vote for Marty? <br/>I'm sorry, I was the  ugly duckling over there. <br/>You're a prized  possession over here. <br/>I'm a firm believer,  what goes around comes around. Marty and Jill have treated me like I don't exist from day one, going all the  way back to the Espada tribe. I mean, I really felt like the ugly duckling over there, and I know I gained  the respect of Brenda, Purple Kelly, Fabio and Sash. So at tribal council, I hope Marty goes home. It's still icing on the cake if Jill goes home. [ã    \laughsã    ] I want the cake, and I want to eat it,  too, and I want both of them gone. [ã    \laughsã    ] Why don't I do this? Why don't I go up to Marty and tell him it's going to be three votes for you,  two votes for Jill, which means you have to play your idol tonight, or... I  guarantee you... You won't go home. <br/>...Jill will go home,  and give me the idol so that we have it Right now the game  plan is, put three of our votes on Marty and two on Jill, and tell Marty,  like, "Bro, you gotta play the idol now," so he does, and then it  will be a tie between Jill and whoever Marty... And Jill vote. And then on the revote, Jill would end up going home. <br/>What are you thinking? <br/>I think we should  really consider this. Ask Marty for the idol. Tell him, "You're safe, give us the idol, we'll vote out Jill," and  then we vote him out. <br/>The... Then the only  problem I see with that is that Jill will have absolutely no allegiance or  confidence in us. <br/>It's going to happen  either way. You think she will ever, ever, ever trust us? We just voted out Marty. <br/>Th-that's what I'm  saying. <br/>Or-or we vote out her. Either one, they don't trust us, and they never will trust us. They're not that dumb, Sash. Tonight either Marty or Jill is going to go home. That's the plan. Sash and I are both stuck on what's the right thing to do, and we're  wondering, what if we could be, like, super mean, ask Marty for the idol and  vote his ass out. <br/>I never thought it  would be such a tough day, dude. So... What they're saying is... They'll split the vote three to two tonight. <br/>Three votes for you; Yeah. <br/>Two votes for Jill, Yeah. <br/>In hopes that-the the  idol is flushed, Yeah. <br/>Um, and then it'd go  to a tie and then in a tiebreaker, Jill would go home. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Um, the other option  to strengthen us... You hand the idol over and I look you in the eye, man to  man, and shake your hand that you're not going home tonight. <br/>Right. Yeah, but I... Would you do that? <br/>I'd just go home next  time. <br/>Look, if this  happens, if you give it to me, um, I'll look you in the eye and shake your  hand again. If we lose the next immunity challenge, I'm gonna give you back the idol. You know, Jill's going home, regardless. <br/>I can't vote for her. <br/>No, no, no. <br/>I hope your people  understand that. <br/>No, no, no. You... You'll vote for... Jane. <br/>Jane, Brenda, whoever  you want. I think it makes sense, but, you know, it's... You know, I can't tell you  what to do with your own idol, so... Right now I feel...  Absolutely powerless in every... Way, shape or form. If I keep the idol... I have to use the idol tonight, so... I give Sash the  idol, and maybe I go home tonight, maybe I don't. I got to give the idol to somebody, so I'm either giving it to jeff tonight  or I'm giving it to Sash. A curse at times, a good thing at times-- the immunity idol is yours. <br/>Thank you, brother. We're in this together, okay? <br/>It's in your hands. I'd rather give it to Sash, because maybe, if he lives up to his word, I  would maybe live one more cycle. One more cycle could potentially get me to the merge, and then things are  wide open. <br/>Well, it turns out I  don't even have to dig for idols. All I have to do is ask for them. People will literally hand me an idol just because I may or may not keep them  in the game a little longer. Marty made a big mistake. That's probably his biggest mistake in the game. <br/>Jeff: So Fabio,  back-to-back losses, reward and immunity. Does Espada have momentum? <br/>Yeah. I think their spirits are up. I think they have momentum. I think they're a strong tribe. I think we're also strong. I think tomorrow or the next reward challenge, I think it will still be an  even playing field. But, yeah, they're feeling good right now. <br/>Jeff: Jane, last  tribal council was crazy. People being surprised, double crosses. What was the vibe before this tribal council? <br/>Some of us got  together and talked; the ones of us that have meshed together really good,  and we made a decision. <br/>Jeff: Is it obvious, Jane,  who doesn't mesh together? Who's on the outside? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Jeff: And do they  know they're on the outside? <br/>I think so. Mm-hmm. <br/>Jeff: Marty, do you  feel that? There's a sense of being in with the group and being outside of the group? <br/>Yeah, clearly. I mean, we came in as a minority into this tribe, and some of us did more of  a flip-flop, and some of us just tried to incorporate ourselves where we felt  we fit in. <br/>Jeff: Who  flip-flopped? <br/>I think Jane's a  flipper. She'll go wherever the wind blows in terms of making sure that she saves her  own skin, and we tried to remain strong and tried to fit in with whoever we  could. <br/>Jeff: "We" meaning  you and Jill. <br/>Jill and I, yeah. <br/>Jeff: Jane, fair  criticism? <br/>Well, when we became  yellow, I became yellow. And that's the way I look at it. <br/>Jeff: Brenda, could  you feel that from Jane? <br/>Totally. From day one. She just... She's just very genuine. She never really tried to make an alliance, it just became a natural  friendship. <br/>Jeff: Jill, do you  feel the separation? <br/>Oh, definitely. From the minute we got to camp, clearly it's an old/young division that still  exists. So it's a little frustrating to be put in that situation, but it's my  obligation to play out of it if I can. <br/>Jeff: Marty, last  tribal council there was a lot of talk about the idol, and the fact that you  had it, would you play it or not. Did that come up again today? <br/>Oh, sure. And you could argue that maybe it was the stupidest move not to play it at  the last tribal council or you could argue that it was the gutsiest move. But I went with my gut instincts and decided to hold onto it. But tonight, you know, is the first time that I feel like I may have made a  mistake this evening. I'm at a disadvantage now. And so do you do something, trust somebody and transfer the power of the  idol, and maybe if things work out and you take a risk, it buys you a little  more time in this game, which, it's a crazy game, you never know what can  happen. <br/>Jeff: Brenda, worried  about where the idol is? Do you know where the idol is? <br/>Well, I don't know  physically where it is. I think Sash has it. <br/>Jeff, the idol is in  my pocket. <br/>I didn't know it was  in his pocket. <br/>Jeff: So Marty, what  happened with the idol? <br/>In talking to Sash,  we agreed that I would transfer the idol to him. <br/>Jeff: So you gave  your idol to Sash? <br/>I did. It could go down as one of the stupidest moves ever or maybe not. <br/>Jeff: Fabio, reasonable  of Marty to be a little concerned that he might have just made a blunder? <br/>Yeah, I think it's  very reasonable because we could easily vote him out tonight. But either way, we have the idol, so I think we come out on top. <br/>Jeff: Brenda, it's  interesting that Fabio says, "We have the idol." I think it's okay to  say "We" because that is how much we trust Sash. <br/>Jeff: Sash, of course  you think this makes perfect sense 'cause you're the one with it in your  pocket. Just out of curiousity, now that you have it in your possession for the  group, you want to give it to Brenda to hold onto? <br/>If that's what we  decide as a group, then maybe back at camp I might do that. At this moment I don't think it serves a purpose. But if there's a time when I lose trust in them... I'm sorry. If there's a time when they lose trust in me, then I'll have to turn it over  or I'll have the biggest target on my back of this entire tribe. <br/>Jeff: Gotta ask, Sash,  you said it, I just heard it. Freudian slip? If there comes a time when you lose trust in them and you have that idol in  your pocket? <br/>That's not what I meant  to say, but that's what I said. <br/>Jeff: Fabio, are you  familiar with the psychologist freud? <br/>Yes, I'm actually a  little bit familiar with freudian psychology. It might have been the whole 90% of the subconscious oming up above and  coming out. <br/>Jeff: Brenda, that's  gonna linger in your brain for a while. <br/>Yeah. I mean, it was a slip. <br/>Jeff: Jane, how big a  mistake could it be for Marty to give up that idol to Sash before tribal  council? <br/>Well, any time you  watch this game and you give up the idol, it comes back to haunt you. <br/>Jeff: Okay, it is  time to vote. Jane, you're up. <br/>This game ain't over  yet. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally  the votes. <br/>Jeff: If anybody has  the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do  so. All right. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Jane. Jane. Two votes Jane. Jill. Two votes Jane, one vote Jill. Marty. Two votes Jane, one vote Jill, one vote Marty. Jill. That's two votes Jane, two votes Jill, one vote Marty. Marty. We're tied. Jane has two votes, Jill has two votes, Marty has two votes. One vote left. Eighth person voted out of Survivor: Nicaragua... Jill. <br/>Jeff: Jill, the tribe  has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Jeff: Well, it's  clear from the vote that this group is making decisions based on loyalty. The question is how long can that loyalty last? Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on Survivor: Uncle Fabio found  some treemail! <br/>Jeff: The merge  brings everyone together. <br/>If that chest is  alone, I'm taking some stuff out of it. <br/>Jeff: So NaOnka works  overtime to tear everyone apart. <br/>That was pretty  frustrating when we realized all these things were missing. It doesn't make any sense! <br/>Um, really grateful  for the opportunity that I've had to meet a lot of fantastic people. Marty, could luck to you. My kids need someone to root for now, so I hope you go all the way to the end. And I just want to say how much this has made me appreciate my husband and my  children. And I hope that they're proud of me for what I've done here.
