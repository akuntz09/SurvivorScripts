<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: Yau-Man discovered the Immunity Idol  hidden at Moto...  This is my million dollars. Mwah! <br/>Probst: ...and he immediately informed Earl. <br/>I would have never thought that a big, strong black man would become one of  my best allies. <br/>Probst: At Ravu, Mookie, Alex and Edgardo found the idol hidden at their camp. They made a pact not to tell Lisi or Dreamz. <br/>Dreamz is not so good about keeping his trap shut, so we're doing it for his  protection and our own. <br/>Probst: Lisi had no idea that the idol had been found. <br/>A little idol digging? I'm, like, "Dude, you're gonna have to wake up really, really early to  fool an old cat like me. What's wrong with you?"  Probst: At the Reward Challenge, the Survivors squared off in a dance  competition...  Okay! <br/>Probst: ...and Earl led Moto to victory. <br/>Moto. [cheering, shouting]  All right, then. <br/>Probst: Lisi was banished to Exile Island, where she broke down. <br/>I really don't want to be here, but what am I supposed to do, man? [thunder crashing] I feel like quitting. <br/>Probst: At the Immunity Challenge... [cheering] ...Yau-Man dominated for Moto. Moto wins immunity! <br/>Flex my muscle! <br/>Probst: With another Tribal Council looming, it looked like Ravu's decision  was clear. <br/>I don't see you guys winning the next Reward Challenge, and that means I get  to go to Exile Island again. <br/>Probst: When Lisi threw in the towel...  I'm done like a Thanksgiving Day turkey, man. [clucks like a turkey]  The fact that Lisi wants to quit pissed me off, because I could probably use  her in the future. <br/>Probst: But Lisi had second thoughts...  What would happen if... we kept on going? <br/>Probst: ...which threw  Probst: ...which threw Edgardo and Alex for a loop. Edgardo and Alex for a loop. At Tribal Council...  I think Lisi wants to go home. <br/>Probst: ...Dreamz called Lisi out. <br/>Do you want to be here? <br/>Okay...  It's a yes or no question, Lisi. <br/>Well, I have to think for a minute, I have to just chill...  Jeff, I'm ready to vote. <br/>Probst: In the end, Lisi's indecisiveness got her unanimously voted off. Lisi, the tribe has spoken. Ten are left. Ten are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? [sizzling] [sizzling]  Do you have the idol now with you? Hey, put it here, man. Are you sure? <br/>Yeah. <br/>And if you use it against me, I'm gonna ... you over, man. <br/>Okay. The idol I have in my pocket is actually for... You know, I'm selfish. I'll admit it in this game. It's for myself, to get myself further along in this game. Now, if that plays into my alliance with these guys, to use these guys to get  further, then I'll, you know, I'm all for it. <br/>We're placing our faith in  We're placing our faith in you, man. you, man. you, man. Okay, fair enough. Okay, fair enough. Okay, fair enough. <br/>Dreamz, hey, man. <br/>Dreamz, hey, man. <br/>Edgardo, Mookie and myself have not told Dreamz about the Immunity Idol. Not because we want to keep it from him so that we can use it against him,  but really, it's just because we don't think Dreamz is good about keeping  Dreamz is good about keeping information to himself. information to himself. information to himself. <br/>Not bad at all. <br/>Not bad at all. <br/>I know, but one at a time,  I know, but one at a time, you know? you know? you know? <br/>Tree Mail! <br/>Tree Mail! <br/>It's not a good Tree Mail. <br/>Uh-oh. <br/>"Gather your personal belongings only, and use the map to paddle your  tribe boat to Exile Island immediately. You are not allowed to bring rewards, tools or flints. Bring only your personal items, including your canteen."  We need to boil up the rest of that rice. <br/>Boil it up, boil it up. <br/>Boil it up. <br/>Boil it up. <br/>Are we living on Exile Island for the rest of the time? We got Tree Mail, and we're like, "Oh, man, we're leaving our  camp." You know, this sucks. <br/>Nope. <br/>The fact that I've been through, you know, the old Ravu situation, I know I  can sleep in the dirt and not eat a lot of food for a while. Me and Earl actually exchanged places, and we were like, "This is great. We can totally do this." Cassandra, Stacy and Boo have been living the  whole time on Honeymoon Fiji here, and they're like, "Oh, my God, we're  gonna like, "Oh, my God, we're gonna die." die."  Gather round, horsemen. Let's see what we've got. <br/>Is this mail? <br/>Is this mail? <br/>This is a map. <br/>It's a map. <br/>Oh! <br/>"Gather your personal belongings only, and use this map to paddle your  tribe boat to Exile Island immediately. You're not allowed to bring rewards, tools or flints. Bring only your personal items, including your canteens."  Sounds like we're about to mix and match again. <br/>No, we... we all go to Exile Island. That's where we stay now. We all merge at Exile Island. What do you think about that? <br/>We're ready. <br/>I think we're merging. <br/>All right, guys, um, so, all right, let's do it, man. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>I don't know what to expect right now. The game takes so many twists. I'm hoping for a merge, but if it's not, I mean, it's part of the game. <br/>All right, so we need to be clear on who we're targeting. We're targeting Cassandra. <br/>I'm getting Cassandra. <br/>You're Michelle? Let's target Stacy. <br/>So the master plan is basically, if we merge, Dreamz tries to pull Cassandra  over, giving us five-five, Mookie tries to pull Michelle or Yau-Man, and I  think I can pull Stacy. <br/>Remember this time right here. Remember how we felt when we was here. Ain't nobody gonna turn back, you know what I'm saying? <br/>And the bottom line is, each of us has proven our loyalty to the other by  essentially giving up someone we were aligned with for the sake of the four,  the four horsemen. You gave up Rock. We gave up Lisi. Right now, we have to get nasty, and we have to use everything that we have. that we have. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. [theme song playing] [theme song playing] [theme song playing] âª âª  Everybody's a bit nervous. Uh, we don't know if a merge is coming up or how it's going to work. People pretty much wracked their brains trying to figure out what's going to  happen next, and I think that everybody is depending on this merge because  they're nervous. <br/>They're coming. They're right there. <br/>So you get dependent on something. "Well, I know I'm going to be safe once I get my boys back." But  hey, there might not be a merge. I mean, you just never know. What took you so long? Instead of thinking so far ahead about this merge and depending on that...  Back again. ...you better think about right now who's watching you and might now who's  watching you and might want to vote you off tomorrow. want to vote you off tomorrow. <br/>When we got to Exile Island and we met up with each other, we greeted each  other. <br/>Hey, Yau, how you doing? <br/>Hi, baby! <br/>And some of us thought a merge is happening. Others thought that there's a big party waiting for us somewhere. Uh, we still have our own colors and our own flags with us, so we have no  idea what's going on. <br/>Where are we going here? Are we going in there? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Let's check it out. <br/>Here we go again. <br/>When we got to Exile Island, there was no instruction. Jeff wasn't around. Um, I thought we were just kind of going to live on Exile Island. We assumed maybe all ten of us were going to live there and it's going to  suck, but hey, at least we came from Ravu, where it kind of sucks anyway, so  whatever. whatever. [Cassandra sighs] [Cassandra sighs]  We decided to go to the top of the tower to see if there was Tree Mail. The entire tribe made it up together. We got into our own little tree house, expecting that this was where we were  going to be for a while. <br/>Fishing is how to do it. <br/>What the hell, then? <br/>Is this the cannibalism part? <br/>Look at that! <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>New colors! New buffs. <br/>Finally, I get rid of the orange. <br/>No orange. <br/>All right, everyone got their buffs? <br/>"Congratulations, you have made it far and now merged into one tribe. Drop your old buffs and wear these new ones with pride as you paddle in one  boat to your home, the old Moto camp." [ cheering ]  I get to see Moto! For once, I get to see Moto and experience that island because I am the only  person that has not been there yet. So we're all going to be back there. <br/>I'm so elated to be going back to Moto. I was thinking, "Oh, Lord, how am I going to make it on Exile Island? We're going to be with snakes, and no bed, no couch. Lord, please, what are we going to do?" So, um, oh, my God, I am so So,  um, oh, my God, I am so elated. elated. <br/>Whoo! <br/>All right! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Thank God, after seven days of hell at Ravu, I get to eat rice, potatoes, a  toothbrush, toothpaste, a shower, and I smell like crap, I know. I'll probably get a turn turn at the bed tonight. Finally, finally, things are looking up. <br/>Let's see if we have surprises. <br/>See if we have a flag, a new name. <br/>Oh, my God! Oh, my God! <br/>I can't even get a bed?! <br/>They took everything. <br/>I didn't, I didn't get  I didn't, I didn't get anything. anything. <br/>Fishing gear. <br/>Oh, what the hell?! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, no! This is, like, a bad dream. <br/>This is, like, this is so messed up. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! <br/>Bastards! <br/>Bastards! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>This is so not cool. <br/>This is real Survivor. We have a cave. <br/>We got a pot and a machete. <br/>We have a pot, machete and a we got a cave. <br/>And that's it. That's all we need. <br/>We've already been trained for this. <br/>When we got on to the Moto beach, turned the corner, and lo and behold,  nothing. I mean nothing. We got a little bit of fishing gear, a couple of pots, a machete, a flint,  and that's it. <br/>I've never seen Moto. <br/>You never did get to see Moto, did you? <br/>Never got a bed. I never a toothbrush. I never a toothbrush. I never got anything. I never got anything. <br/>Everything was gone. No bed, no couch, no shelter, no bathroom, no nothing. I felt okay with that. I kind of laughed. Had a little smirk on my face because I've already been trained. You know, being at the old Ravu for 13 days-- hey, I'm just back home again. <br/>Everybody has the same way now, so. <br/>Good. <br/>All right, well...  Everybody gather around for the mail. All right. "Now it is time to reveal your world from scratch. Give yourself a new name, paint your new flag, and start the game anew."   That's it? <br/>Yeah, that's it. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>All right. <br/>Okay, what's the name, guys? <br/>Something that has to do with the islands or something I don't know. <br/>Venaca. <br/>Isn't Venaca "thank you"? <br/>Thank you. <br/>And "Bula" is hello. <br/>Let's do Bula. <br/>Bula-Bula. <br/>I... I vote for that. <br/>Bula-Bula. <br/>Bula-Bula it is. <br/>Bula-Bula. <br/>Either that, either that or the nooky-nooky tribe. <br/>Bula-nooky. <br/>Bula-looky-nooky. <br/>Hello. <br/>So who's good, who's good at drawing? <br/>Me and Stacy? <br/>We decided on Bula-Bula as the tribe name because "Bula" the tribe  name because "Bula" is how you say "hello" in Fiji. is how you say "hello" in Fiji. <br/>On the flag itself or on what-what's going on here? <br/>The flag. <br/>No, I wanted to look at our canvas. We can never be so sure in this game, you know. <br/>I know. <br/>We want to be in a safe spot. I think we are now, don't you? <br/>Yeah, yeah. I'm a little worried because you guys are all still super close. <br/>Yeah, but the thing is, Michelle, is that I don't that think that we're a  threat because we're girls, and those guys are going to get super competitive. It's interesting, I think boys are going to start attacking boys and getting  them off game before they're going to touch the girls, because they look at  us as non-threats. So we'll be, like, the last to go. I mean that's how it's lined up for now. We're in a pretty good spot. <br/>Now I'm like-- now I'm thinking like the other island is better. <br/>As far as fishing, yeah. <br/>Because we could get more food. <br/>Like crabs. We're a new tribe now. But there-there's a core group. There's a tribe within the tribe and the tribe within the tribe is myself,  Michelle, Cassandra, and Yau. Now it's just divide and conquer. We have to kind of divide up that old Moto and get them one by one and knock  them out. <br/>What do you all want to do? <br/>Yeah, let's divide everything up and just get-get going. So the moment has final arrived. These first couple of hours are really crucial. They're going to determine who's the final five. I'm ready to fight. <br/>All right, so who's going to go fishing? <br/>I can go. <br/>I'll go. <br/>Let's go us four, then. <br/>There are two slings. Two people can be crabbing while another couple of people can sit on the boat  and try to fish. <br/>I had my niche in the first Moto tribe. I had my niche in the second Moto tribe and I was very comfortable. At this point, I'm not comfortable at all, so I'm going-going to take a  backseat. And that's all I can do is be a good little helper, and then when it's time,  I'll assume when it's time, I'll assume leadership role again. leadership role again. <br/>How was camp over here? <br/>It was good. It was nice. We had a good little, um, thing going. <br/>Me and Dreamz hooked up at Ravu, so we got good. <br/>I was hoping that. I was hoping that. <br/>Yeah, I mean we clicked and then... he said, you and I saw-- I said, you know  me and Yau, like I trust Yau at Ravu. <br/>And Earl and Michelle. <br/>Am I still one who trusts someone, Yau? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Or have I left? <br/>No, I didn't go to the dark side. <br/>We were all afraid. <br/>First second, we got onto this island, four horsemen as we discussed-- we  were going to go split up and figure out what was happening at Moto. And so we went straight to work, and infiltrated that group and and infiltrated  that group and kind of gained their trust. kind of gained their trust. <br/>Are you guys good with Boo? Do you guys like him or...? <br/>Oh, no. I'm a...  He goes first. <br/>We can't decide whether it's Boo or Stacy. Stacy because we don't want the Alex connection, but now that we merged...  Yeah. <br/>And that's the thing, Boo just stirs up too much...  He gets it going quick. <br/>Yeah, he stirs too much. You gotta get him out before he starts, like...  Mm-hmm. <br/>Right away, we found they want Boo out, and then we take out Stacy. Right now, our plan is working out perfectly as far as what we know. We just have to execute it right. <br/>So, Boo first? <br/>Boo first. <br/>Boo first. And then Stacy or Alex. And then Stacy or Alex. <br/>Currently, I'm the only one with the idol, and Earl is the only one who knows  I have the idol. Potentially, there should be two immunity idols in play right now in the game. The question is who's got the other one? The next opportunity we have we would like to vote out Boo, and I think we  have pretty much secure Mookie's and Dreamz's votes, but we don't trust  nobody votes, but we don't trust nobody here. here. <br/>Oh, it's so cute! <br/>Oh, it's so cute! <br/>There you go! <br/>There you go! <br/>Yeah, he goes first. For sure. <br/>I really have a lot of trust in Alex, because we're both original Moto, and  that's just, you know, the chance that I'm taking. But he's the most trustworthy person that I can think of right now. <br/>I mean, I think we should do what's most convenient for us. You know, me, you, and Ed are tighter-- are going to be tighter together than  whoever it is that's around. <br/>And then we-we also are more solid, too, on a vote. <br/>Yeah, we're more solid...  Against two. <br/>I can use the relationships I've had to sort of create smoke and mirrors, to  keep them sort of guessing, so that, you know, the four horsemen can take it  all the way. Unless I'm mistaken, the four of us are controlling this game right now. I could be wrong, and I could be getting set up, but this is my best bet. What can I do? I know you're smart. I'm not worried about you. I just wanted you have all the information I have. information I have. <br/>No, I appreciate it. <br/>No, I appreciate it. <br/>We all want Boo off. <br/>Yeah, so Boo's going to go off first. <br/>And then we're going to get Stacy off second. Stacy off second. <br/>The thing is-- yeah...  The thing is-- yeah...  The thing is-- yeah...  Okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>All of a sudden, Mookie let Dreamz know that we had the idol, and as soon as  that happened, my gut was like, "Ooh, that was not so smart." But  you can't say a ... word. <br/>You can't say...  Do I look like...? Shut up. <br/>No, no, no, no, just...  I'm not... no, I'm not...  Don't tell, don't tell Cassandra. <br/>When Alex and Mookie told me that they had the immunity idol, I was kind of  mad because they didn't tell me when they first found it. <br/>Just a few days ago. <br/>Why didn't y'all tell me? <br/>'Cause we didn't...  Only because of Cassandra, just to make sure. But we were going to tell you. <br/>We had a pact, and they kind of made me not trust them a little bit and-and  made me feel that I was on the outskirts. So, point-blank, I'm going to trust them until I can't trust them no more. Strange. No, I wouldn't have said anything. I'm glad you all told me now because I was getting kind of scared. I-I was getting kind of scared about...  ...now it works perfect. <br/>Now is everything's perfect. Let's do it, y'all. Don't screw up. Don't screw up. No more talk. No more talk. <br/>Dreamz knows about the immunity idol, by the way. <br/>Who told him? <br/>Mookie wanted to tell him. <br/>You told Dreamz about the idol, man? <br/>Why? <br/>All right, I'm going to tell you right now, I don't like that plan. Like not-not that I don't trust you, but trusting all these people...  No, no, either way, we're taking out Boo first. That's-that's everyone's consensus. <br/>I'm pissed off about the whole situation right now. We found the immunity idol. It's something that, you know, you need to keep between three or two people  to make it work. That's all the people that needed to be told, and Mookie just told Dreamz out  of nowhere. And now I feel really uncomfortable because Dreamz has the... knows about the  idol; Cassandra knows about the idol; Earl knows about the idol. <br/>Do you get what I'm saying? <br/>Maybe-- I mean, I don't know how you feel about this, but we should maybe  just take Boo out first, and then at that point Stacy has nowhere to go. And I trust Stacy. She's not gonna, she's not She's not gonna, she's not gonna... gonna... So we  could pull her in. That's five. That's a five-four majority. That's the simplest way. Stacy will be loyal, and we don't really have to worry about her winning the  final immunity, I don't think. And we can put whatever order you want. you want. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. <br/>I mean, that's fine. <br/>I mean, that's fine. The original plan was to actually take out Boo and then Stacy. Things changed. Alex and Edgardo want to bring Stacy. Now, bringing on Stacy is only in their best interest, because they still  have the relationship from the old Moto. So when it gets down to five, as we planned, Stacy is on their side, and me  and Dreamz, you know, we're left out of the loop. <br/>If Dreamz tells somebody, I'm going to kill you, Mookie, I'm going to kill  you, Mookie, man, seriously. man, seriously. <br/>No one knows who has who. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>And that's great. <br/>Mm-hmm. [chuckles]  You're still the most popular girl here right now. You and Michelle, too, actually. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Michelle's getting pretty popular. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>And long as they just, they don't pay any attention to Dreamz still. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I don't think, I still don't trust Mookie. <br/>Uh-huh. My alliance is with some of the people from Ravu side: Earl, Yau-Man. And then Earl has Michelle on his side, and then definitely Dreamz. I was really hoping that he would make it through to the merge. We've pretty much got the numbers on our side. <br/>Hey, just keep them thinking that they have you. Keep them thinking that I'm not thinking. <br/>Mm-hmm. Yes, I'll definitely do that. That's easy. <br/>We'll just sail on. I was actually happy about the merge 'cause now the game is really on. It's time to take it to the It's time to take it to the advanced level. advanced level. <br/>Let's see what's going on there. <br/>I'm like, do I bring my shoes  I'm like, do I bring my shoes or do I run? or do I run? <br/>What? <br/>Still Boo? <br/>Boo, Stacy-- 'cause that's two out of the way. <br/>What they're saying now is they want to keep Stacy on board and use her the  whole time to have majority. <br/>That's me and you out. <br/>I know, I know, I know. That's why I don't want to take Stacy with us. <br/>No way, no, point blank, no. <br/>They just want Stacy on their side to take one of us off. <br/>Take one of us off. <br/>Because we said guaranteed five. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Take one of us out, then he's gonna take us out. That will bring too much into Alex's hands. <br/>I ain't trusting nobody with Stacy around, you know what I mean? 'Cause they gonna always have numbers with Stacy around. That's why I said Stacy second. Do you understand? I was planning a long time ago. I'm really looking forward to voting off Stacy because she treated me so bad  when I was with the old Moto. She treated Cassandra so bad, and all of a sudden she's happy and nice and  glad to see me all of a sudden 'cause I got friends and she ain't got the  power no more. power no more. She's got to go. She's got to go. She's got to go. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! I'll take that from you, Earl. I'll take that from you, Earl. You guys ready to get to today's challenge? today's challenge? <br/>Yep. <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: Draw a stone. Do not look at it in your hand. Do not look at it in your hand. Separate bag for the ladies. Separate bag for the ladies. Separate bag for the ladies. Keep it covered. Keep it covered. Keep it covered. One left for you, Earl. One left for you, Earl. Everybody, put your hands out. Everybody, reveal. If you have orange, go to the orange mat. If you have green, go to the If you have green, go to the green mat. green mat. <br/>Another twist. <br/>Probst: Edgardo, you kind of shrugged your shoulders. <br/>I don't know what to expect anymore. I'm just like, well, you know, bring it on. Let's do it. Let's do this right now. <br/>Probst: Boo, what do you think's happening? think's happening? <br/>I think we've switched again. <br/>I think we've switched again. <br/>Probst: You have merged. You are one tribe, but for today's challenge, you will be competing against  each other. You are two teams in this challenge. The green team will be Alex, Michelle, Mookie, Stacy, and Dreamz. And the orange team: Edgardo, Cassandra, Boo, Yau-Man and Earl. All right, should I tell you about the challenge? <br/>Yes, please. <br/>Yes, please. <br/>Probst: On my go, you will be shown a large Fijian mask and given time to  memorize the symbols and their arrangement on the mask. You will then paddle in your boat down the river to three different stations. Each time you come to a station, you must retrieve a bundle of puzzle pieces. When you have all three bundles, you'll paddle to the finish. Two tribe members from each team will then use those pieces to construct six  of the symbols that you saw on that mask. You must then place the symbols in the correct order on your team mask. First team to get it right wins. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Winning team wins immunity. The five people on that team will not go to Tribal Council. You will be safe from another vote and guaranteed a one-in-nine shot at a  million bucks. In addition, the winning team will feast. Steak, skillet to cook it in, some seasoning, vegetables, couple bottles of  wine. Worth playing for? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: For the losers, nothing except this note and a date with me at Tribal  Council. All right. We'll get you guys in your We'll get you guys in your boats, we'll get  started. boats, we'll get started. Here we go. Reveal the mask. The symbols you want to study are the symbols in the turtle shell at the top  of the mask. Whenever you're ready, take off. This challenge has begun. <br/>Ready. <br/>Probst: Green team thinks they have it. They're heading out first. <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Yau-Man says they've got it for the orange. for the orange. Both teams are paddling. Both teams are paddling. <br/>Turn, turn, turn. <br/>Turn, turn, turn to the right, turn to the right, guys. <br/>Turn to the right! <br/>Probst: Both teams at the first station. <br/>Okay, stop. <br/>Probst: Stacy trying to get her bundle of pieces off. There is a learning curve here...  Back up. <br/>Probst: ...how to use this tool. <br/>Just keep it steady. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man has a system. He's working it. <br/>Switch out real quick. <br/>Yeah, go ahead, go ahead. <br/>Probst: Stacy having trouble. They're gonna switch out. Dreamz gonna get up there now and give it a shot. Yau-Man working quickly. <br/>Go, go. <br/>Probst: The orange team is heading out. They have their first bundle of pieces. Dreamz trying to figure it out. Quickly, the green team is falling behind. <br/>You want to try, Alex? <br/>Give it to me. <br/>Probst: Alex now trying to give it a shot for the green team. The orange team at their second station now. Green team still working on their first bundle. <br/>Go! <br/>Probst: Yau-Man has the second bundle. They're heading to their next station. Alex has the first bundle for the green team. <br/>Dig, dig. <br/>Probst: Green team trying to make up some time. Orange team with a decent lead as they head to their third station. Orange team now at their final station. Yau-Man working quickly on the third bundle for the orange team. He's got it and they're heading to the finish. Alex has the second bundle. They're heading to their last station. <br/>Dig, dig, dig, you guys! Dig hard! Dig, dig! Cassandra, Cassandra, dig! <br/>Row, row, row! <br/>Probst: Green trying to catch up. Earl, Cassandra, Boo, Edgardo, Yau-Man still with a big lead Yau-Man still  with a big lead as they head to the finish. as they head to the finish. Green team now at the third and final station. They're working on that third bag. Alex has the last bundle. Green team is heading to the finish. <br/>Row, man, keep rowing. We're not moving. <br/>Probst: The orange team, they're slowing down. <br/>Come on, Dreamz. Bring it home, baby! <br/>Probst: Dreamz, Alex, Michelle, Stacy, Mookie, trying to finish strong. You're still in it! <br/>Come on, guys, row! <br/>We got it! Go! <br/>Come on! Row! <br/>Probst: Orange team has clicked in. Two people working on the puzzle. <br/>Come on, guys! Come on! <br/>That one. <br/>He's got it! <br/>Row, row, row! <br/>Row, row, row! <br/>How does this go in? <br/>How does this go in? <br/>Probst: Earl and Yau-Man losing valuable time now. <br/>Somebody do it. I got all the pieces. I got all the pieces. <br/>Probst: Two people working on the puzzle. It's Michelle and Alex for the green team. <br/>That one. Earl-- he's got it, Earl. <br/>Forks in the middle, forks in the middle and all the way around. By Yau, by Yau. By your side! <br/>Top right goes the arrows. <br/>No, we know, we know. <br/>Probst: You have to get all six pieces together. Then you put them in their spot Then you put them in their spot on the mask. on the mask. <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>Okay. <br/>Right behind, there. <br/>Right behind, there. Right in front of you.

No, no, no, you had it! No, Yau, you just had it. There you go. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man makes a last-minute switch, and it's a good thing he did. [cheering] Orange team wins immunity and reward! <br/>Good teamwork! Good teamwork. Good teamwork. Good teamwork. Good teamwork. Good teamwork. Good teamwork. Good teamwork. <br/>Probst: Congratulations. [applause] No Tribal Council tonight. In addition, you will feast-- steak, wine, some veggies. Michelle, Stacy, Alex, Mookie, Dreamz, all I have for you is a date with me  at Tribal Council and this note. I'll now read the note. "You will not be going back to camp. There will be no time to strategize. We're heading to Tribal Council We're heading to Tribal Council right  now." right now." Head down. Head down. Let's go. Let's go. [Orange team cheers]  Whoo! <br/>See you tonight. Take care. <br/>Dinner, yeah! <br/>MVP or VIP, both. <br/>We're going to pop open this bottle of wine immediately. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Is it? Where's the salt? <br/>Whoo! [laughter]  It went down like-- it went down like this... whoa! <br/>I can feel it going down. <br/>We're going to be running... we're going to be streaking naked. <br/>I don't want to cook because we have so little, if I mess it up, then I'll  get beat up. <br/>That's what Boo does for a living, he cooks. <br/>That challenge saved my butt. If we hadn't been divided into teams, I would have been gone. There's no question. You know, I dodged a bullet. That's good. <br/>That meat looks glorious. <br/>And besides that, we all got steaks and sautÃ    ed  vegetables. It was nice. It was nice. It brought my spirits back up. It brought my spirits back up. <br/>Man, victory is sweet. <br/>I didn't want to go to Tribal Council, man. <br/>I know. <br/>Can't strategize, can't conspire... Straight from the challenge. <br/>Hey, wink at somebody. <br/>That's going to be hard. <br/>That's crazy. <br/>It might be something really crazy that happens, that somebody we didn't even  think they would vote off would be gone. <br/>I'm a little bit worried about Alex right now. I hope he doesn't get voted out because if he gets voted out, all my plans  will be like, all the strategies that I worked for the last 24 days will be  gone. But, uh, Mookie has the idol right now, and maybe, you know, he can use the  idol smartly. You know what pisses me off? The chance that we didn't get to say bye to the person. <br/>Yeah, man. <br/>That sucks that we can't do that. <br/>Who do you think they're going to vote out? <br/>I think it's a toss-up between Stacy and Michelle. <br/>I think it will be Stacy. <br/>It can be a surprise, though. If Michelle is gone, I'm definitely concerned about the future, 'cause she's  a key component in my strategy. So I'm really keeping my fingers crossed that, uh, she's still alive. This is going to be a very, very interesting vote, 'cause you're going to get  a lot of truth going to get a lot of truth from people. from people. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Rocky and Lisi voted out Rocky and Lisi voted out at the last Tribal Council. at the last Tribal Council. Dreamz, tell me about the merge. Was it exciting? Was it bad news? What was your reaction? <br/>I felt it was like day one all over again except this time people already know  people. So it was all the same to me 'cause I had friends from the old Moto and  friends from the new Ravu, so I was pretty, I was pretty happy with that. <br/>Probst: Alex, what was your reaction when you got to the beach and found out  you were really going back to the original Moto? <br/>Kind of a "holy crap." I was shocked. I mean, when I got there, I was, like, "This is not good. This is not going to be fun."  Probst: Mookie, can you start to feel paranoia setting in already? <br/>Definitely feel the paranoia. I mean, people are developing different relationships, and you kind of lose  yourself in it, and you don't know where you stand anymore. And definitely you feel the paranoia, especially on the hot seat again. <br/>Probst: Why are you on the hot seat? <br/>I think everybody here is on the hot seat. We weren't able to talk to each other. And so now we're here not being able to devise a plan, not being able to talk  to each other, understand where our stances are on who we think should go,  and that makes me paranoid. <br/>Probst: Stacy, so here you sit now, getting ready to vote somebody out with  no idea what everybody else is thinking. How uncomfortable are you? <br/>Um, it's pretty uncomfortable. I think it's a toss-up. Right now my head is spinning a little bit because there's a group here and  there's a group there and there's a group to the right and the left and  behind you, and everybody is thinking about different scenarios and different  alliances. <br/>Probst: Dreamz, give me a reason to get rid of Stacy. <br/>One good reason for me to vote out Stacy is because it ain't me. <br/>Probst: Michelle, give me a good reason to get rid of Dreamz. <br/>Me and Dreamz haven't really talked much about strategy, so I can't really  say who he's in an alliance with. It's a fear of the unknown. <br/>Probst: Mookie, what's a good reason you should get rid of Michelle? <br/>I mean guess one thing about Michelle is, uh, we had a relationship at the  old Ravu, and we were good then, but she could have switched to a different  side. That's something I'll have to think about in the next, I don't know how many  minutes, you know, and determine who could be the biggest threat, and who  can, you know, strengthen my alliance. <br/>Probst: Michelle, give me a good reason to get rid of Alex. <br/>I think the biggest reason to get rid of Alex is that he's a threat in  challenges. He performs very well every time. And when it comes down to immunity being so important now, it's definitely a  threat. <br/>Probst: Alex, give me a reason to get rid of Stacy. <br/>I don't really have a good reason to get rid of Stacy, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Give me a reason to get rid of Michelle. <br/>I don't know Michelle as well as I know anyone else on this tribe right now. <br/>Probst: Give me a reason to get rid of Mookie. <br/>I don't have a reason to get rid of Mookie. <br/>Probst: Give me a reason to get rid of Dreamz. <br/>I don't have a reason to get rid of Dreamz. <br/>Probst: Dreamz, do you think as people speak here tonight, that they are  speaking not only to me to answer a question, but also to everybody else here  to kind of say "here's what I'm thinking" by giving me their answer? <br/>He just let you know whose name he's putting on the paper. He don't have to talk to me. He's one of the people I do trust in the game. So I understand where he's coming from. <br/>Probst: Mookie, how do you think this will change the game, tonight's vote? <br/>I think it's going to reveal some things to the other guys that are eating  steak right now. And they're going to see who's been telling the truth and who has been lying. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. If somebody does have the hidden immunity idol, and it turns out you want to  play it tonight, you would present it to me before I read the votes. It's time to vote. It's time to vote. Alex, you're up. Alex, you're up. <br/>Sorry, Michelle. It's nothing personal. It's nothing personal. I'm just playing the game. I'm just playing the game. <br/>You were on the list  You were on the list of people to go. of people to go. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now is the  time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Stacy. Michelle. One vote Stacy, one vote Michelle. Stacy. Two votes Stacy, one vote Michelle. Michelle. We're tied. Two votes Michelle, two votes Stacy. One vote left. Ninth person voted out and the third member of our jury: Michelle. Michelle. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Michelle, the tribe has spoken. Michelle, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. Well, it was clear tonight's vote will have a major impact on this game. And there are five people waiting back at camp eager to know exactly what  that impact will be. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor: Mookie confronts Dreamz about Mookie confronts  Dreamz about his vote at Tribal Council... his vote at Tribal Council... ...and  the fireworks begin. <br/>I am irritated with Cassandra. She just made the worst mistake of her life. <br/>I'm not going to deceive y'all. <br/>Probst: And Dreamz can't  Probst: And Dreamz can't keep quiet. keep quiet. <br/>Survivorhas been an amazing experience. I think my alliance is a little weaker now that I'm not there. Earl is going to have to find himself a new spy. But I think I've just affirmed I know what kind of person I am, and I know  what I'm capable of, and that I'm just as strong of, and that I'm just as  strong as I thought.
