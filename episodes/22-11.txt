<br/>Episode 11 -  <br/>Jeff: previously on "Survivor": Matt, you are  back in this game. We are merged. [ cheers and applause ] at the merge, Matt quickly rekindled his  relationship with Andrea. <br/>I've been talking a lot with Andrea because I consider her  my closest ally. <br/>Jeff: But Andrea answered to a higher power. <br/>Here's what's going down. Matty's got to go home tonight. <br/>I really like Matt but Rob is kind of the king around  here. I mean, he's very smart. <br/>Jeff: And she joined him in his second blindside of Matt. Matt. Once again, the tribe has spoken. At Redemption Island, in the first three-way duel, Matt faced  dave and Mike. Mike and Matt stay alive. And dave became the first member of the jury. Back at camp. <br/>We're guaranteed to go to the final six. <br/>Jeff: The former Ometepe tribe celebrated their numbers  advantage. <br/>Ometepe! <br/>Jeff: But Phillip broke up the party when he got into a heated  argument with Steve. <br/>Every time I make an argument with one of those guys it's  I'm [ bleep ] crazy. <br/>Jeff: And Steve's ally Julie retaliated by hiding Phillip's  shorts. <br/>Phillip is going to have to hang out in his underwear from  now on. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, it was clear the former Zapatera  tribe was in trouble. Until Phillip directed everyone's attention to himself. <br/>He resorts to calling me crazy because he doesn't want to  say the "N" word. He wants to say crazy, crazy, crazy. <br/>Jeff: And Julie surprised everyone when she came clean. <br/>I took the shorts. No one will ever find them. Dug a hole and buried them and a rock was on top of them. <br/>Jeff: But she got an even bigger surprise when she was  sent to Redemption Island. Now Ralph and Steve are all that remain of the former Zapatera  tribe, and their only hope, a crack in the Ometepe alliance. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'd like to reach out an olive branch handshake to you. There are no apologizes needed from either one of us. You're a man. You had to say what you had to say. <br/>As soon as we got back to camp I was approached by Steve,  and he said, "Hey, man, I just want you to know I want to bury the  hatchet. I'm not a racist, man. I'm really not. And I hope we can get together on it," and he shook my  hand. I don't feel it was totally genuine. <br/>There was no prejudice in my crazy comment. I just thought you were crazy. <br/>Okay, I hear you. <br/>All right? <br/>I felt it was a little self-serving because he mocked me a  number of times, and so pRobably Steve will go next. Perfect, I'm glad you came and spoke to me. Have a good night, man. <br/>Yeah. I would really think a mature guy with any wisdom and any  empathy or heart or whatever would have reached out after going off the way  he did, because he had to have known, you know, what an ass he made of  himself but I was the one who reached out and I think it had quite a bit to  do with settling the whole race thing he brought up and hopefully we buried  that. <br/>Good blindside tonight, too. <br/>Oh, tonight. You guys didn't see that coming? <br/>You didn't see that coming? <br/>Yeah. <br/>No. <br/>We like to keep things interesting. <br/>Yeah, it will make our remaining days here easier for  everybody. So I'm just going to keep plugging away and working the relationships  and being open and friendly and who knows? Boston Rob may want to just keep myself or Ralph around and  maybe they'll cut phil loose. <br/>I was nervous. I didn't want to spend that much time-- on race and I was like,  oh, my god! <br/>Phillip is not going anywhere. Phillip is under my protection. As long as he keeps up his stupid antics, they'll be coming to  me all the way to the finals. <br/>The last of Zapatera men. <br/>Yup. <br/>Where's numbnuts? <br/>He went out there to the big rock. <br/>Maybe he'll jump off. <br/>Yesterday, my trunks were hidden by Julie before she got  voted out. So I got up this morning, and I had a premonition that I was  going to find my shorts. My great-great-grandfather, full-blooded cherokee indian came to  me in a vision. And he said, "Look near the water hole." I knew it  wasn't the ocean he was talking about, it was the drinking water. I went there, found the first rock, and turned it over. No, not there. Went to the second rock, there my shorts were. Am I good or what? Am I good or what, baby! He be the man! Here's to you, Julie. Don't mess with the undercover specialist because he makes his  living uncovering truth, and most people, like you, can't stand the truth. What did jack nicholson say to tom cruise? "Son, you can't stand the truth. You can't take the truth." that's what I'm saying to her. You cannot mess with the specialist. Let this be warning to all who would attempt to hide some shorts  from me. It's futile. It's frivolous. Because without a clue. <br/>What? How did you find that? <br/>Baby, you know, I'm the specialist. All right? Yeah, baby. <br/>Congratulations. We're at peace now. <br/>You bad! You bad, baby! <br/>Phillip, he's a different breed. Again, there's no prejudice behind it, but he's a little crazy. It's-- it's crazy. Hey! <br/>He's a freaking lunatic. I think they're getting tired of him, too. <br/>I got shorts, baby. Wooo! You're never going to find them shorts, as she parted last  night. I can't wait to show up with them today. <br/>With your shorts on. <br/>You got it. No clue, nothing. <br/>Sweet. <br/>Yeah. I need to go get that rock. That big old rock she talked about. I am so excited about seeing Julie at the duel today because I'm  going to show up in these shorts. My new footrest. And she's going to know that you can't pull the wool over the  undercover specialist. I am truly blessed. <br/>Were you able to get some winks last night, Julie? <br/>Oh, my gosh. I slept so good. Day what, 28? 27 nights. That was the best night I've ever slept. <br/>All right. <br/>It gets harder and hard to get up every morning. Matt had incredible strength going through Redemption Island the  first time. After he was blindsided the second time by the folks he thought  were truly his friends, he's kind of been on a little downward spiral. <br/>I'm gonna go sit on the beach for little while. <br/>Okay. Matt has great faith, and he's able to endure a lot of hardship  because of his faith in god. <br/>Poor Matt. He seems like he's done. <br/>Yeah, he's pretty down. But you can tell he's kind of at his breaking point. You know it's all those subconscious things. He's already thinking about going home, and that can affect the  outcome of a challenge. <br/>I think coming back here was really, really rough on him. It took a lot of the wind out of his sails and after being here  for three weeks and competing in, like, six duels. <br/>This is unlike anything I've ever really experienced. I'm out here wasting away. I'm missing my family. I can't-- I can only feel them when I really, really try. <br/>I guess he was really close to Andrea, too, and I guess  she was just sharing everything that he was telling her. <br/>I figured. <br/>With the tribe. <br/>I never did trust her. <br/>No, she's not to be trusted. <br/>I never did trust her. <br/>God has me here for a reason. I said this from the beginning that god wanted me here. I don't know what the reason is for. I can't see that yet. But I know he wants me to be here. He's literally been... God has literally been carrying me for  the past four days. I know I'm still in the game but I'm so over this game. <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the competitors for today's duel. Matt, Mike, and Julie. Matt, 21 days. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: On redemption. Only seven days in the regular game of "Survivor."  where are you at with this? You've had an incredible roller coaster of emotions out here. <br/>Just overwhelming peace about everything. I felt this need that if I kept winning, I could honor my god  more and more. But he just kind of hit me with a lot of peace, and he was just  like, you know, you've honored me enough, and if I go back, I go back, and if  I go home, then I go home. And I'm at peace with that. <br/>Jeff: This is a very different Matt than I've seen in the  past. It sound to me like you're ready to go home. <br/>Uh, I'm going to do the best I can in today's challenge,  but, yeah, I think I'm ready to go home. The only reason I was staying in this game is because I thought  there was more of god's will to accomplish, and I feel like I've accomplished  what I came here to do. So whatever happens, I'm ready for it. <br/>Jeff: let's get to today's duel. It is "Survivor" shuffleboard. You will each have one shuffleboard and three pucks. Your goal-- slide your puck across your board through the  obstacle, into the end zone. If any part of your puck touches the end zone, it counts. The first two to land all three of their pucks in the end zone  stay alive on Redemption Island. Loser is out of this game for good and will become the next  member of our jury. Clear? <br/>Clear. <br/>Clear. <br/>Jeff: This is most definitely it. One shot. Take your spots. All right, here we go. Matt, you're up with the first shot. That first obstacle, no good. Mike is up. Mike lands his first puck in the end zone. Julie's up. Julie short. We'll clear the pucks each round, except the ones in the end  zone. Those will stay. Keep your board clean for you. Mike has one puck in the end zone. Matt and Julie zero. Matt is up. Matt short again. Mike with another nice toss. That is in the end zone. Mike making it look easy. He has two of his pucks in the end zone. Julie, you're up. Julie lands one in the end zone. Julie with her first puck. Matt, you've got to get on the board. <br/>I'm working on it. <br/>Jeff: Matt lands one in the end zone, just barely, but  that will count. <br/>Matt's kind of pissed at me. I made eye contact kind of, and it almost looked like he gave me  a really dirty look. I could have been reading into it, but it was just, like, a  weird feeling. <br/>Jeff: Mike could stay alive on redemption with this shot  right here. Nope. Julie short. Matt looking for that second puck. And he's got it. Matt now with two pucks. All it takes is three to stay alive. Mike is short. Julie looking to land that second puck and stay even. Short again. Matt, you're up. God is not done talking to Matt. Matt has three pucks in the end zone. You are staying alive on Redemption Island. Whether you want to be here or not. Here's where we stand-- two people are going to stay alive on redemption. One is out of this game for good. Mike has two pucks in the end zone. Julie has only one. Mike could do it right here with this shot. Can he do it? Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: just short. Less than a quarter of an inch. Julie stays alive. <br/>Come on, Julie. <br/>Jeff: Julie, gotta land this. Julie lands one in the end zone but knocks another one out. Julie stays right where she was with only one puck in the end  zone. Mike could do it right here. And he does! Mike and Matt stay alive on Redemption Island. <br/>It was meant to be. Good job, you guys. <br/>Jeff: So, Matt, are you frustrated with your god right  now? <br/>I mean, you just gotta be accepting. I guess he still wants me here for some reason. I told him I'd stay here as long as he wanted to. <br/>Jeff: how many days did jesus fast? <br/>40. <br/>Jeff: It's interesting our game is 39 days. Doing well so far. Julie, after 28 days. <br/>28 days, yeah, of not brushing your teeth. Holy moly. <br/>Jeff: why were you out here? <br/>I didn't come out here to make friends. Like many americans, my house is in foreclosure, and this was an  opportunity for me to make a better life for my girls. And my kids are proud of me either way, you know. And I came short of the money, but I'm walking away with something  bigger. My life is-- is changed. I see Matt's story with god, and I am looking forward to going  back home, finding a church, and just getting involved. <br/>Jeff: Julie, your shot at the money is over. You are out of this game. You can toss your buff in the urn on the way out. But you're not leaving us. You're going to return and be a second member of the jury. <br/>Way to go, julez. <br/>I love you guys. [ applause ] good luck. <br/>Peanut butter and oatmeal! <br/>Jeff: All right, guys, you both stay alive to live another  day on redemption. Nice work. Grab your stuff, head back. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Hang in there, Matt. <br/>I hope that Matt stays, and maybe he can come back. And, like, if he came back in the game, I'd, like, want to talk  to him but I don't think he can really trust me, like, in this game ever  again. Why would he? <br/>It felt weird. Like, I felt, like, really bad about myself for, like, playing  him. You know, for all of us playing him. <br/>No--  I did. <br/>That's what he wanted. Like, he didn't want to play the game. <br/>Like his spirit seemed broken. I don't know, it was weird. It was just, like a weird feeling. Matt was like, I don't care if I go out. I feel bad because I played him the hardest. I had close conversations with him and he said he forgives us all  and stuff but I think he's kind of pissed at me. <br/>We all put him there, you know. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>It wasn't just you. <br/>No, I know. I just--  Yeah--  I definitely played him the hardest. I feel like I was a big part of, like, breaking his spirit. So in a way I kind of, like, felt a little guilty on a human  level, not on a game level. <br/>I was thinking the same thing. <br/>You know what I mean? Because, one, she is pretty good in challenges, as far as  puzzles and stuff go. But we don't need to worry about that--  And she's, like, friends with with all the other people  over there, and she's having second thoughts. <br/>I think, dude, the first chance we get, get her out of  there. I've been concerned about Andrea and Matt's relationship. If he comes back from Redemption Island, we got back from the  challenge, and she said she felt sorry for him. It's things like that just-- you're kind of shaking your head  going, ah, I don't know if you've learned. If we play this right, it should be smooth sailing. <br/>We're good. <br/>We're good. <br/>We decide who goes when, and that's it. <br/>The upside to getting rid of Andrea before getting rid of Steve  and Ralph because that's one less thing to worry about. Then again, timing is everything in this game. When to pull the trigger as far as when to vote people off is  huge. And it might come down to just immunity challenge, you know. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: First things first, Boston Rob, give it up. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. In today's challenge, you will compete in a log roll. You will match up against another tribemember. Your goal-- stay on the log longer than the other person. First person to hit the water is out, winners move on. Last person left standing wins immunity, is safe. Losers, tribal council where somebody will be voted out and sent  to Redemption Island. In addition today, you are playing for reward. After 30 days, I can't imagine anybody that doesn't have a sweet  tooth. <br/>Oh! <br/>My god! <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>That's exactly what I asked for. <br/>Jeff: Chocolate cake. And, of course, ice cold milk. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Jeff: In addition today, one other twist, which I will  tell you about later. I know it's worth playing for. We'll draw for match-ups. We'll get started. All right, here we go. Our first match-up, Grant taking on Boston Rob. First one to hit the water is out. The winner moves on. Move on out to the color. We're on. Good first match. Rob is in the water first. Grant wins and moves on. <br/>I love you, Rob. <br/>Jeff: Next two, it is Andrea taking on Ashley. This challenge is on. Andrea's in the water first. Ashley moves on. Next match-up, Ralph taking on Steve. Steve, have you ever done anything like this? <br/>Yeah, I'm in a league, a league every saturday. <br/>Jeff: here we go. Good footwork. Steve is in first. Ralph moves on. Last match-up in this first round. Natalie taking on Phillip. We're on. Natalie is in first. Phillip moves on. All right, let's move on to the next round. It is Grant taking on Ashley. The winner of this match moves on to the final round. Here we go. Grant trying to get Ashley running. Nice recovery. Ashley in the water. Grant moving on to the final! Next round it is Ralph taking on Phillip. Winner of this moves on into the final where they will match up  against Grant. We're good. <br/>Come on, Phillip. <br/>Jeff: Nice, nice recovery. Phillip is in first. Ralph moves on to the final against Grant. <br/>Way to go, Ralphy. <br/>Jeff: This is it, the final round. Grant taking on Ralph. Immunity, chocolate cake for the winner. This is it. Grant and Ralph. <br/>Let's go, big country. <br/>Good job, Grant. <br/>Jeff: Got a good match going. Nice recovery. Another nice recovery. <br/>Let's go, Ralph. <br/>Jeff: Both guys looking pretty comfortable. Who's going in first? Ralph is in, Grant wins immunity and chocolate cake! <br/>Yeah, Grant! <br/>Grant! <br/>Jeff: Grant, nice work. Grant safe tonight at tribal council, cannot be voted out of  this game. In addition, you've won a huge chocolate cake. <br/>It is pretty big. <br/>Jeff: It is pretty big, and I know even after a month and  a mouth full of sweet teeth you couldn't eat that cake alone. <br/>I couldn't. <br/>Jeff: Choose one person to join you. <br/>Guys, I'm sorry, I gotta-- Rob, come on down. [ applause ]  I wish everybody could have some. I'm sorry. <br/>That's all right. <br/>Jeff: All right, Grant, choose one more person to eat with  you. <br/>Man, I'd hug your neck if you'd let me eat some of that. <br/>Jeff: That may just put you out of the running. <br/>I'm not a gay person, but I don't know what else to do. <br/>Jeff: All right, Grant, one more choice. Who's it going to be? <br/>Ah... Andrea, come on down. I'm sorry, you guys. I'm sorry! <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: All right. And the twist that I referred to earlier. Do not open that. It is for the tribe. Bring it with you tonight to tribal council. <br/>Okay. <br/>All right. <br/>Jeff: All right, so Rob, Andrea, and Grant are going to  feast on chocolate cake. You will have two minutes to eat as much as you can. The two minutes start now. <br/>Just eat it like a pig. <br/>I don't want to choke. <br/>There is so much rich fudge in there. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I wish everybody could have some. <br/>Don't talk. Just eat. <br/>I chose Andrea as a strategic move of wanting to make her  feel comfortable in our alliance, because tonight at tribal, if certain  scenarios come up, where we need to get rid of one of our own, Andrea is  going to be that member. <br/>You guys are good! <br/>We got a mystery package. Jeff gave it to us and said we had to open it at tribal council. It could be something where we-- you know, we go, we vote  somebody out at tribal council, and the twist is we vote another person out,  or something like crazy outlandish. <br/>What do you guys think the twist is? <br/>I don't know. <br/>It feels like a deck of cards, huh? <br/>Like if you pick the wrong card you're going home? <br/>Maybe. <br/>The whole card thing kind of threw me off but right now  everybody feels comfortable because there are the two easy votes, Ralph and Steve. <br/>I'm beat, man. <br/>I think that us six having so much faith in each other, I  think it would be silly to get rid of one of our own before the Zapatera  people. <br/>Pardon me? <br/>One more time. <br/>Can't pull another win. I'm disappointed in myself. I thought I could do better than that. Gave it all I had. One of us is on the chopping block, and it's pRobably me. All I can do is hope whatever is in that little box that Jeff  said to definitely bring is good news for me. It might not be. Chances it being for me, no, but all I'm doing is hoping. All I can do is hope. <br/>Those cards will stir up something tonight. Me, I'm ready to drop. My strength is-- is-- my stomach is just sucked in. <br/>This is what's going on right now-- Steve's thinking, I've  had it. I'm done. So Steve's not going to do anything to cause any pRoblems with  anybody. Ralph, on the other hand, poses a threat because physically,  he's capable and his head is still in the game so Ralph's got to go next. I don't understand why there has to be a twist. Always a twist. <br/>I'm actually excited about the twist. <br/>I am, too, because the ball's in our court. <br/>Who knows what this twist is all about. Maybe somebody else has a chance to win immunity. Maybe it's a situation where two people are going to go home but  we only get to vote once. It could be anything. So we've got to hedge our bets and make sure we have backup  plans and know who we're voting for. Grant and I, we already talked about getting rid of Andrea  before Zapatera, so it leaves us other options. <br/>Tonight, it's obviously Ralph. If it's a twist and we have to get rid of two people--  If we have to vote somebody else off. <br/>Then it's her. <br/>Rob's very smart, and he's played this game before, and so  we're kind of taking our lead from him. We're voting for Ralph tonight. There's also a twist, though, and we may have to vote out two  people tonight, in which case, Andrea will go home. If Matt comes back from Redemption Island, she's still got a  soft spot for Matt, so it just makes sense to get her out. You three girls could turn this whole thing upside down. I would guarantee you that Rob's pretty much making the  decisions who comes and who goes. He'll start picking you guys off, and take nimrod with him to  the finals. Nobody will vote for nimrod. So we're definitely going to be voting for Rob tonight. If you three jump in, it's your game. <br/>We'll consider. Thank you. <br/>Steve came up to us and was basically like our two votes  are going for Rob, so if you three girls want to make a big move, like, now's  the time, blah, blah, blah. Which, obviously, we didn't entertain. <br/>I knew they were going to do this. It's their last attempt, and that's why they're just trying to  get anything they can and do whatever they can. So let's just hang in there. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It seemed like Steve may have gotten his second wind. He's going to members of my alliance behind my back trying to  come up with a plan to get me out of here, which makes me think I should  maybe get rid of him first. What I was originally thinking about I'm thinking about not  doing now because I may have to wait to get rid of Andrea. <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the members of our jury. David and Julie. Rob, the last three tribal councils, Zapatera, Zapatera, Zapatera. Is that where we are again? Is it going to be Steve or Ralph? <br/>Most likely. Unless there's something that we don't know about. <br/>Jeff: Steve, you kind of sense that, that this Ometepe  group is unbreakable? <br/>Sure, yeah, the writing's on the wall. We've tried to stir it up and raise a little havoc. We've told various groups who Ralph and I are voting for, and if  they want to jump on board, it could be huge tonight. <br/>Jeff: Andrea, Steve does make a good point. At most, the Ometepe six have two more votes. Steve and Ralph. There is a certain time when it might make sense to say I'm  making a move. <br/>I mean, it does make sense strategically, but I feel  completely safe that we're all rock solid because we really do feel like  we've worked hard to get to the place that we're at. <br/>Jeff: Ralph, odds are, tonight's vote, one of you two are  going home. <br/>Well, I went a little further in the game tonight. I'd say it's going to be me. <br/>Jeff: Steve, how about you? <br/>I'm thinking it most likely would be Ralph. Ralph's been really tough in the challenges. Better performing than myself. So...  Jeff: Rob, that's the right thing to say if you're Steve. "I don't have much energy. I'm kind of worthless in challenges. Vote him out."  It's the right thing to say if he wants to stay. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>But, Jeff, you can't take Steve's lackadaisical answer as  "I'm quitting." the dude played in the nfl. He's not quitting. <br/>Jeff: Not a quitter. <br/>He's not a quitter. <br/>I would second what Grant just said because I'm  recognizing that he's not as feeble as being put out there. I think he could step up at the right challenge. Gotcha. <br/>Jeff: Steve, before we go to the vote, this could be your  last chance to speak up. <br/>I remind the girls of the seasons past, Boston Rob asked a  guy to save his girlfriend, amber, then cut him loose the first chance he  had. So it will get brutal after Ralph and I are gone. So it's now or never to do something large. <br/>Jeff: Steve is bringing up "Survivor: All-stars"  in which if you're a "Survivor" fan you know Rob made an alliance  with amber all the way to the end and she beat him. There was one critical moment where he needed help from somebody  and after he got his help, he cut his throat. The other side of the coin is he didn't betray amber. In fact, he hasn't betrayed her since. <br/>That's true. You can look at the flip side if you have a good relationship  with Rob and he gives you his word, he could take you all the way. <br/>Jeff: hard to deny history. You betrayed lex, but you stayed true to the true alliance with  amber. <br/>The one I still have to this day. <br/>Jeff: All right, it is time to vote. Grant has the immunity necklace. Cannot vote for Grant. Everybody else is fair game. Grant, you're up. <br/>Let's do it! Let's do it. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you'd like to play  it, now would be the time to do so. All right. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Rob. Rob. Two votes Rob. Ralph. Ralph. Ralph. That's three votes Ralph. Four vote Ralph. Two votes Rob. 12th person voted out. Ralph. That's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Ralph, the tribe has spoken. <br/>See you, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Not so fast. Grab your torch. Head to Redemption Island. You're still in this game. Okay, now let's get to the twist I mentioned at the immunity  challenge. Who has it? Open it up. Flip over that top card and read the back of it. <br/>This could be interesting. <br/>"You will now compete in your next immunity  challenge. You will then immediately vote out one more tribe  member."  "You will now compete in your next immunity challenge. You will then immediately vote out one more tribe  member."  Jeff: Steve, you can hold on to those cars. I'm going to give a stack of cards to everybody else, and grab  the necklace from you, Grant. <br/>Steve's gotta win. <br/>Jeff: Take a look through those cards, get familiar with  them. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. Here's how it's going to work. I'm going to show you guys a series of symbols. You're going to repeat them back to me using the symbols on your  card. Every time you get it right, you stay alive. If you miss one, you are out. Last person left in this challenge wins immunity, is safe at the  vote that will happen immediately following this challenge. All right. Here we go. All right. Show me the first symbol I showed you. Everybody has the canteen. The canteen is right. Show me the second symbol I showed you. Hook was the second symbol. Everybody is still alive. Show me the third symbol. What was the third symbol that I showed you? Natalie is not sure. Everybody reveal. Everybody has the pot. Everybody's right. Natalie, you're still not sure you're right. The fourth symbol I showed you. Steve, Rob, Andrea, Grant, and Ashley all have fire. Phillip has the knife. Natalie has the machete. Correct answer--  Aah! <br/>Jeff: Fire. Natalie is out and Phillip is out. We are down to five. What's the next symbol I showed you? Steve shows canteen. Ashley shows canteen. Rob shows canteen. Grant and Andrea show pot. The correct symbol was canteen. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: Grant and Andrea are out of it. We are down to Ashley, Rob, and Steve. All right, show me the next symbol. Ashley and Steve show fire. Rob shows pot. The correct symbol was pot. Rob wins immunity. Nice job, mariano. All right, we're going to go straight into the vote. Rob has immunity. You cannot vote for Rob. Everybody else is fair game. Natalie, if you'll come get the urn. <br/>Ometepe! <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden emimmunity idol and you want to play  it, now would be the time to do so. Okay, once the vote are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Grant. Steve. Steve. Two votes Steve. Steve. That's three votes Steve. One vote Grant. 13th person voted out. Steve. That's four. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Steve, the tribe has spoken. Grab your torch. Head to Redemption Island. Good luck. Well, congratulations. There are no more Zapateras left. That's the good news. Bad news-- nowhere left to hide. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff:next time on "Survivor": For 30 days, the Ometepe  six have dominated the game. <br/>Ometepe! <br/>Jeff: But now they're forced to turn on each other. <br/>One of us has to go to Redemption Island. That's a fact. <br/>Jeff: And a massive challenge leaves everyone depleted. <br/>32 days of hard work gone just like that. <br/>I see daylight ahead now. If one of us Zapatera guys gets into the top three, we'll be the  one to win it. I want to be that guy. I bet you Steve lost 40 pounds. <br/>40 pounds, pRobably. <br/>I mean, he's pitiful. <br/>You got room for one more? Steve! Steve!
