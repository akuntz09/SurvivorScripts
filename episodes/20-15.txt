<br/>I came for one one reason and one reason only-- for another million dollars. <br/>JEFF Probst: Sandra undid Sugar's top. <br/>I'm not a physical person. I didn't hide behind no immunity necklace. I've been sole surviving since my alliance was wiped out. You know how some people forgive but don't forget? Well, I don't forgive and I don't forget. You want Russell gone? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Russell's gone. <br/>She's weak in challenges. She's ease to beat for the vote. <br/>Russell's keeping me around because I'll never get a single vote-- but I  don't know about that. <br/>Probst: Sandra moving on. <br/>I don't believe it. <br/>Probst: If anybody has the hidden immunity idol...  Should I let you finish? I had to take care of myself. I want the title of sole survivor. I think I deserve it. I think I deserve it. [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause]  Probst: Welcome to the Survivor: Heroes vs. Villainslive reunion show in New York City where we have just crowned our  first two-time winner. [cheers and applause] So, Sandra, does that-- does the fact that you are the  only person who has won twice, does that make you best player ever? <br/>It makes me the queen. [laughter] That's what it makes me. The best ever, yes. <br/>Probst: Without question? <br/>Without question.uestion? I mean, I have two titles. What else can you ask for? I always-- I go out there and my goal is to make it to the end, and I make it  to the end and I win. You can't beat that. You can't beat that. [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause]  Probst: Parvati, is Sandra the best ever? <br/>Sandra is extremely logical and her argument makes perfect sense. However, I mean, I have to argue because I've played three times, and I've  lasted the most amount of days, and I'm kind of a challenge dominator, so...  [cheers and applause]  That doesn't mean anything. That doesn't mean anything. I played twice, and won twice...  Let's arm wrestle. <br/>...and she played three times and only won twice. <br/>Probst: Russell, third person in this trifecta. Best player ever-- Sandra? <br/>Do you really want me to explain this to you? [laughter]  I want to hear it. <br/>Get on him! <br/>Probst: in 30 seconds or less  Okay, okay, social player-- No. She's lippy, and she knows it and she loves it, and that's okay. But social game? No. Physical game? Maybe the worst physical player to ever play the game. <br/>That's actually strategy. That is actually a strategy. <br/>Probst: It is true that in...  Wait, wait. And...  Probst: You have the floor. <br/>Let me finish! Strategic game, her strategic game from day one, get rid of Russell. You know what? It never panned out for her. So let's award her...  That's right. <br/>...for her failures. <br/>That's right. No...  You know what, the problem is...  Because after a certain point...  The game...  ...there was no use in getting rid of Russell. <br/>Let me talk. <br/>Probst: Give your finish. You've got ten second  The problem is the game. I think there is a flaw in the game. <br/>Probst: A flaw in the game of Survivor? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Okay. <br/>If she can win the game twice, there is a flaw in the game. [audience groaning]  Probst: What's the flaw? <br/>Probst: What's the flaw? [audience booing] [audience booing]  Let me tell you what needs to happen. <br/>And he doesn't like it. <br/>Let me tell you what needs to happen. <br/>Nothing needs to happen. <br/>Probst: Hold on, hold on. Russell, Russell, Russell, stop. [laughter] You've had 78 days to talk. I'll give you ten seconds to tell me the flaw. <br/>Okay, what needs to happen is America needs to have a percentage of the votes. percentage of the votes. [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause] I'm just saying. I'm just saying. <br/>You still wouldn't win if they had a percentage of the vote. <br/>I would have won last season. <br/>You still would not win. The only people here that like you are you right there. That's it. <br/>Probst: You're pointing to his family? <br/>One, two, three, four, five. <br/>Probst: Sandra, let me ask you this. Let-- this is a debate that will go on. For the record, that's obviously not...  Whatever, yes. Our show is not that. Our show is very clearly defined in that you have a group of people, you put  them in one situation. You vote out people, and in the end the last group, that jury, decide who  they think deserves it. This isn't a game in which you include America. That's a different game. <br/>Otherwise I would have won. <br/>Probst: So you haven't won this game. Maybe you would win that game. Sandra, what was your key move? Was there one move that you look back on and say if this hadn't happened,  might not have gotten there? <br/>I have a ton of moves, Jeff. Like I've always said, I was a fan first before I became a survivor. When I go out there, I take a little bit of every season and use it to my  knowledge and to my ability, and I learned from every season what mistakes  not to make and how to proceed in the game. So I take it day by day. <br/>Probst: Tom Westman, what does it say, as one of our favorite winners...  [cheers and applause] ...clearly. What does it say on one hand Sandra has only played two times and she has won  both times. She has never been voted out of this game. On the other hand, in all the times she's played, she's never won a single  challenge. Even beloved Courtney has won a challenge. [cheers and applause]  You don't have to win a challenge. You don't have to win a challenge. <br/>Probst: So, Tom, what does that say about what the elements are required to  win this game? <br/>I've always said the game is a third physical, a third strategic and social,  and it's a third luck. A lot of luck comes into it. The one thing I've always maintained is, whoever won that season deserves to  win that season. <br/>Thank you. <br/>That's the way it plays out. That's the hand you have. It's the people that you're surrounded with. If you win it, it's your game. It's yours. Sorry, Russell. Congratulations, Sandra. [applause]  Probst: Russell, are you surprised you didn't win, didn't get a vote? <br/>You know what? I didn't play twice. I played once-- but a long time. <br/>Probst: Referring to the fact that the played back to back without a break. <br/>Let me tell you how good I am. <br/>Oh, boy. <br/>Really? <br/>Back to back means nothing. Rupert played back to back. <br/>When I can make a winner, a winner...  Probst: J.T., you're referring to...  ...look like the dumbest player in history, then that means I'm good, right? <br/>Probst: Well...  No! <br/>No! That's good. That's good. I like the way...  Probst: Let me just say...  I can't let that happen. <br/>Probst: All right, Russell, plant it. Let me just say for those of you who are with us, here in Letterman Theater  and those of you watching with us at home, I'm not exaggerating when I say  this is what it was like every single day out there. All right, we're going to take a break. When we come back, we will still hear more from Russell, because I have a  feeling he's just getting started. And later in the show, ironically, Russell, you tipped off something we're  going to do. We are actually going to crown the winner of the dumbest move in  Survivorhistory-- and J.T., you're in the running. But first, let's relive some of the toughest challenges from this season. this season. [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause]  Get that ball. <br/>Probst: Big battle! Trying to get back without...  Ow! <br/>Probst: Colby goes strong. Tom not messing around. Tom not messing around. Candice now takes Parvati out! Candice now takes Parvati out! <br/>You've already proven yourself to be a disgusting human being to swear on  your kid's life. <br/>The great powerful Rupert. The good guy. <br/>You know...  The second coming of Christ. <br/>The second coming of Christ. You're such a dumbass, Rupert. You're such a dumbass, Rupert. You're such a dumbass, Rupert. [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause]  Probst: Welcome back to the Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains reunion show in New York City. Sandra, one of the story lines that came out with you this year was your  husband being in Afghanistan. As you said, this is what-- he's over there. This is what I do. I hustle on Survivor. Where is your husband? There he is. [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause] Stand up. Stand up. He's good. And he-he's just back for two weeks. <br/>He's back for two weeks. <br/>Probst: To be a part of this? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: And then he's heading back to Afghanistan? <br/>Right back. <br/>Probst: Well, we thank you for your service. What did he say to you, when you guys hugged down there? What did your husband say? <br/>He said, "Good job," don't let Russell get to me. I'm the queen. <br/>Probst: Parvati, do you think that when it came time for the jury to vote, do  you think teaming up with Russell worked against you? <br/>Yeah, I think so, 'cause Russell was so hated by everyone on the jury that  everyone just lumped me in with him and was like, "Oh, you were riding  his coattails. You were his sad little, you know, pathetic, like, coattail rider, which was  obviously not true, you know. But no one in this game believed anything that I was saying, so I had to just  win challenges. <br/>Probst: Well, I have to say, it's worth pointing out your stats, 114 days in  this game-- the record. Nobody has played this game longer than you. [cheers and applause] And also worth noting, tied for second in terms of most  individual challenge wins. You definitely...  Who is first? <br/>Probst: Colby Donaldson holds the record for... Seven. Yes. Russell, what happened? Did you know what happened with the hat at the time when you came back and it  was gone? <br/>No, I didn't know what happened with the hat. I figured somebody did something, but it was... You know, there was three  people left. So what strategic move would that be? So I'm like, "Where's my hat?" I don't know where my hat is. <br/>Probst: So is the first time you saw what happened just watching it tonight? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Reaction, when Miss Sandra said...  I think, you know what, it was a good move. <br/>It stunk, it was dirty, it was funky, so I threw it in the fire. <br/>You know what? I give credit where credit is due. <br/>And I felt bad after I did it, because he said he wore it for two seasons,  but then when he started acting crazy, then I was like, I'm glad I did it. <br/>Really? Two seasons? No. I give credit where credit is due. And you know what, by burning my hat couldn't fluster me at Tribal Council. But, you know, at the end of the day, Parvati...  Probst: Parvati what? <br/>She probably should have won. [cheers and applause]  Probst: Well, again, Russell, that's a different game. <br/>I do give credit where credit is due. <br/>Probst: That's called "Russell decides who wins Survivor." That's...  Pitch that to Mark Burnett. He might really like it. <br/>I think he would. <br/>Probst: Let me ask you-- are you aware, though, when you're playing this game,  are you aware of jury...  I don't careabout that. I play as hard as I can. You know what? <br/>Probst: Russell, stop! Take a deep breath with me. Russell, you and me, right here. Here we go. <br/>Okay, me and you. [laughter]  Breathe. <br/>Probst: Yeah, okay, I'm just trying to get some information here. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Are you aware during the game, like, when you get into an argument  with Rupert that's that vicious-- we just saw a clip of it coming in-- you're  not going to get his vote? When you betray Jerri, you're probably not gonna get her... Are you thinking,  do you think, "Well, that's two votes, but I've got others"? <br/>You know what? After I played the first time and played right again, is... I played one time. And I was whipped. <br/>Probst: That's not the question. Are you aware of the jury? This is a fundamental...  I know. <br/>Probst: Let me explain something before you answer. <br/>I hear what you're saying. <br/>Probst: Well, you haven't answered what I've asked, so I'll ask you again. <br/>He doesn't understand. <br/>Probst: Do you...? [laughter]  He doesn't know what that means. <br/>Probst: Do you think about the fact that the social game is something you're  missing? <br/>I don't care about that fact! I play the game as hard as I can. I do what I have to do. I do what I can do. And you know what? I make it to the end every time. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob, Boston Rob...  But you'll never win. <br/>Okay! <br/>Okay! [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause]  Probst: Boston Rob. Boston Rob, quick... quick question: if you and Russell hadteamed up, how  might that have gone? <br/>It would have gone pretty good. The problem with Russell, and I think what he's trying to say to you is that  he doesn't play the game to win. And it's clear in his strategy. He plays a good game to get to the end, but he doesn't play a game to win the  game. And that's where he and I differ, among other things as well. If we had teamed up, we could have done pretty well together, I think. <br/>And you play the game to win? <br/>I do play the game to win. <br/>He does. <br/>When have you won? <br/>I haven't. <br/>Just sayin'. <br/>But I guarantee you, given the opportunity, I'd gladly go back and kick your  ass all over the island. <br/>Okay, I will love it! <br/>Okay, I will love it! [loud cheers and applause] [loud cheers and applause]  I ain't shaking your hand. <br/>You're not shaking my hand? You know what? Let's make it happen. <br/>Probst: All right. <br/>You make it happen. <br/>Probst: That could be a future season: Rob vs. Russell. All right, I want to talk about something else that I found very, uh, I  thought was impactful this season, a couple of dumb moves, starting with you,  Tyson. It's a little hard to set up, but if you watch the season, there came a time  at Tribal Council where Boston Rob had laid it out: "Here's what  "we do, and we get rid of "either Parvati or Russell by the end of  the night." Inexplicably, you change your vote in the middle. Not only were you voted out, you changed the entire course of the game. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Do you think about that? Does that haunt you? <br/>All the time, yeah. But, you know what? You make, you have to take risky moves in the game to-to get far. <br/>Probst: Was that was risky or dumb? <br/>If it would have worked out, I would have looked like a genius, Jeff. Like, Parvati knows, she's played the game with, like, 85 people in  Survivorhistory, and half of 'em are here, and so, and I knew everybody hated  Russell, so to keep him around...  Probst: So you were playing the odds. <br/>Right, and I knew that there was a chance. I knew he had the idol, 'cause Coach told me...  Probst: All right. <br/>..and I knew that he could give it to Parvati. <br/>Probst: so you-you've got a strategy behind it. <br/>Yeah, definitely. <br/>Probst: J.T., the other dumb move this season. We've already talked about it. My only question for you is, I saw that move as a pretty decent strategic  idea. If you were right and he needed you, it could have been a brilliant move. Do you have any regrets about that? <br/>Not at all. I would have never done it if I thought I was safe to begin to begin with,  you know? I was at a point where I felt like I was going home, you know the next couple  of votes no matter what. The odds were against me, and I was hoping to play with Coach, Rob, Courtney,  or, you know, Tyson. And one by one, they got picked off. So I was like, "Well, you know, I know I'm not going to be able to play  with Parvati...  Probst: You, again, you played the odds. <br/>My back was against the wall. You know, I reached out to somebody. But I did not know he was not playing the game to win, you know. Who knows? <br/>Probst: We have been conducting a poll online... to see, to see...  Do we get any money if we win this thing? [laughter]  Probst: No, actually, you, the winner of this actually has to give some money  back. [laughter] We've been conducting a poll to see who the audience thinks has,  has made the dumbest move over the past 20 seasons of Survivor. There are five nominees. Tyson is one. J.T. is another. James, the guy with two idols that got voted out back in in China. Colby Donaldson is one for... people say you took the wrong person back in  Australia. You could have won if you had taken the Chef Keith. And even Erik... Where is Erik? Erik-- wow-- with a new haircut. Oh, my gosh! We don't recognize him anymore, the ice cream scooper. All right, here are the dumbest moves. Take a look at this flashback. <br/>I'm not going anywhere. I'm on Survivorwith two idols. <br/>Probst: Tenth person voted out and the fourth member of our jury-- James. <br/>I want to give individual immunity to Natalie. <br/>Probst: 13th person voted out and the sixth member of our jury-- Erik. <br/>Russell, play the idol tonight, and save yourself. <br/>You don't hand the enemy the idol. <br/>Probst: J.T. <br/>I'm going to vote for Parvati. <br/>I thought it was an opportunity to flop my vote to Parvati. <br/>Probst: Tyson. <br/>I don't even know that I have a 50-50 shot against Tina. However, I'm choosing to go into the finals with Tina. <br/>Yeah! [applause]  Probst: All right, in typical Survivorfashion, we took some tiki thing and  turned it into a trophy, and your name will be on here. I'm proud to say that of the five, the winner comes from this season-- and,  Tyson, it is not you. J.T., congratulations on making the dumbest move in Survivor history. [cheers and applause]  Thank you. <br/>Probst: All right, still to come, Sprint is going to award $100,000 to one of  this season's castaways based on your votes. Up next, some of the season's contestants surprised us, others were major  disappointments. We're live, Heroes vs. Villains Reunion Show. Villains Reunion Show. Be right back. Be right back. <br/>Probst: James goes after Randy, and with one push. <br/>Real classy. [bleep]  Get the [bleep] out of here! <br/>Somebody push this toward me. <br/>Shut up! Shut up! <br/>I don't care who you are, you just don't talk to people like that. <br/>Shut the [bleep] up and listen to the guy who's done the challenge. <br/>A little less cursing off your tribe might help. your tribe might help. <br/>Keep your mouth shut. <br/>Keep your mouth shut. <br/>Keep your mouth shut. [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause]  Probst: Welcome back to Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains. It's our reunion show. This season we had a lot of surprises and disappointments. James, I think it's fair to say you might have been both, in that  disappointing to see you get injured and leave again, but the surprise for me  was your attitude. You just didn't seem like you were having fun from day one. What was going on? <br/>I mean, I really was kind of having fun. It just kind of didn't seem that way, I mean...  Probst: To, to nobody. <br/>I mean, we had... y'all just seemed to catch me in my moments of the worst  times ever. I love it. I mean, it hurt my mom's feelings. I'm sorry, Mama, but I really...  Probst: So you're telling me, James, there was nothing going on. Because I've seen you play now three times, and I, even from the beginning  thought, "Man, the dude's in a bad mood."  It was just... 'cause I was with a great team. I mean, I was with...  Probst: Are you disappointed in yourself? <br/>I'm disappointed in my knee. I'm getting old, but...  Probst: But you like how...? So you're all right with it? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Honestly, you were trying to help me. Like, the whole thing with Stephenie, like, he was trying to...  Probst: Here comes Amanda to James' rescue once again. <br/>Yeah, yes, she is. <br/>He was! He was trying to help me. <br/>Probst: Rupert? <br/>Yes? <br/>Probst: Tough start for you. <br/>Oh...  Probst: A few minutes into the game you have a broken toe. <br/>Right. <br/>Probst: How did this compare for you in seasons past? <br/>See, and it wasn't just one toe. It was two bones in one toe, and the toe we taped it off to was broken also. I didn't know that till I got out. And you know, it put me in... I thought I was gonna be out the first day when  they sat me out thinking I was weak on that first challenge. <br/>Probst: What do you make of the whole good versus evil? What do you take from this? <br/>It was tough, you know? The lines are always blurred. I tell people all the time, I stole, I lied, I manipulated and I was one of  the Heroes, you know? I mean, the game is... the game is what the game is. I like going out, though, and being called one of the Heroes. [cheers and applause]  Probst: Colby, you were brought back because you represent-- you embody the  qualities of a hero on Survivor. This season, a horrible start, minutes into, moments into the show. Did you know... did you have a feeling this is not gonna go well right away? <br/>Well, physically I did, yeah, yeah. Losing to Coach in the first challenge, physically, I knew things were  different. They were going to be very different. [laughter] [laughter]  Probst: He's still behind you. <br/>Let me do it again! Let me do it again! <br/>Hey, get a room! [Colby sighs, blows raspberry]  Probst: You know, we're looking at some of it now. But you also, though, you didn't seem to be enjoying yourself out there. <br/>Yeah, I had more fun watching the season than I did playing it. I really did. <br/>Probst: Is that because it's your third time? <br/>Well, I-I think there was some adventure lost with this, and that is a big  part of it for me, you know? And part of that was, was the inability to really go in the water. Whether it was fish, swim, all that. You know, we were really quarantined. We couldn't explore in the jungle, and that's a lot of what I enjoyed from  the previous seasons, even in Panama, when we weren't winning. You know, Lex and Ethan and I would go out and free dive every day. There was a lot of fun. There was a lot of adventure. And I couldn't find that this time. So you couple that with my poor performances in the challenges, and it just  wasn't...  Probst: A rough season. <br/>It was a rough season. <br/>Probst: Amanda, you've played this game a lot. You know, you're second to Parvati, I think, in days played. Obviously, you've done very well. You were, you were one of only four people to make it to the end twice. You, Sandra, Parvati and Russell are the only four people who've done that,  and yet there's this one quality that seems to elude you, and it's that  killer instinct. Does this haunt you in life as well, when you just can't...? [all groan]  Wow! <br/>Probst: No, Amanda, I'm not, I'm not picking on you. It's what everyone on the street says...  You always pick on me. <br/>Probst: ...she's such a good player, but then you back off. You come to James' rescue. You know, you, you... you know what I'm saying. <br/>Yeah, I don't... I don't know what that is. It just, it happens. Like, when it comes down to the cut time where I have to perform, it just,  like, doesn't happen. I don't know what it is. It's, like, it's just something in me, I feel bad or something, you know? I feel bad about voting people out. It's like the game is really emotional for me. <br/>Probst: Yeah. Still, today? <br/>Yeah. Not as much. [laughter]  Probst: Stephenie...  Hi, Jeff. <br/>Probst: ...you, kind of like Colby, came in, in terms of women, you know, you  represented this ideal of great competitor, physical-- you know, shoulder  halfway out of your body on day one. You never really got up to to speed. <br/>Yeah. No, I mean, I was, like, very grateful to come back a third time. And I knew that there was a good chance I was gonna go very early in this  game. I mean, there's, like, probably three of us here that really doesn't hang out  with any of these other people. So, um, then the shoulder dislocation was extremely unfortunate. Um...  Probst: Did you have fun? <br/>I mean, I was there, like, six days. I tried to have fun, but I was on the outs before the game even began. But, Jeff, I'll tell this. It's nothing that a filet mignon pizza can't cure at my restaurant, G.G.... [cheers and applause] G.G. Restaurant and Lounge. Jeff, what else do I have? Come on! I played for six days. <br/>Probst: Okay, good. Congratulations for you. I'm glad you have a restaurant going. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Cirie, is there anything you can do in this game when you come into  it with the kind of target you had on your back, is there... is it just  that's just the way it went this season? <br/>[sighs] Jeff, I don't think there's anything I could have done different  besides-- I don't know, maybe pay Tom a million dollars. I mean, I did everything I could. When people have a perception of who you are and what you are, it's hard to  break that. And if you're not given the opportunity to break it, then you get what you  get. <br/>Probst: I want to, I want... Do we have-- see if we have this video. Coach, you supplied a moment this year with Tyson that was one of the most  interesting and touching and funny moments. If we have this, I want to roll it. If not, we'll just talk about it. Do we have it? <br/>Why doesn't anybody ever say anything good about me? Am I that bad of a person, man? <br/>If you want to stick it out, I'll help you through it. <br/>Thanks for coming out here, man. man. <br/>No problem, dude. <br/>No problem, dude. <br/>Probst: Now, now, Coach...  Probst: Now, now, Coach... [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause] Coach,  just one question... we don't have a lot of time...  Oh, geez, you've got to preface it with that? <br/>Probst: Well, because you will tell a story. <br/>All right, yes. [laughter]  Probst: I found that a very endearing moment. You truly were trying to say, what is it about me? <br/>Right. <br/>Probst: Have you learned anything about how people perceive you on this game? <br/>I think, you know, the first time I came into it I came in as Coach, you can  never be wrong, you've always got to, you know, keep a stiff upper lip, and I  saw myself on television and I said, "That guy is an arrogant ass."  And I got to change about that. And so I learned from the game and came into the next game-- I wanted  redemption so bad. And early on, the reason why I broke down is because all these thoughts were,  "Can I change it? Can I change that perception?" I'm trying my best, and at that point at  Tribal, when Sandra said that, I thought maybe I can't change it. Tyson gave me a great empowering speech. Change who you are. And I woke up the next day and I just thought, "You know what...?"  Probst: Are you a different guy? <br/>I think so. I definitely think I'm more humble, down to earth, more chivalrous to all the  ladies. <br/>Oh...  Probst: No, come on. As we go to break, I have to share something. We have our first Survivorbaby. Boston Rob and Amber have given birth. Let's see, there she is. Lucia. And that's Amber who won Survivor: All-Stars. A very successful Survivor reunion. <br/>Probst: All right up next, one of these players is going to win $100,000  courtesy of Sprint. But first, taking us to the break, our Survivorcomposers who write all of our  music in every episode, Russ Landau, David Vanacore. David Vanacore. <br/>Probst: Since Thursday viewers have been texting and voting online for the  Sprint player of the season. The honor comes with $100,000 cash prize. The votes are in, and it has come down to, fittingly, a two-person race  between good and evil. On one side, we have Rupert, one of the two finalists. And on the other side, look at Russell, already shaking his hand like he  knows it's him. It is Russell. So... America decided between good versus evil, and much like the game went,  evil has won again. Russell is the Sprint player of the season... the season... [cheering and  applause] [cheering and applause] ...and the winner of $100,000. And you will say... I'll say it more succinctly because we're out of time. You will say that's proof to your point that America...  America-- they make the decision. They should. <br/>Probst: Jerri...  Yes. [cheering] I have to say, having watched you play this game three times, it  seems like this season it all came together. Are you happy with how you played physically, competitively, strategically  and spiritually? <br/>Jeff, I am so excited to be here again for a third time, and I have to say  that watching the show, I was really proud of the way I played the game and  watching it, I just felt the same way times 1,000. And I feel like I've kind... the irony of my situation is that the first time  I played this, people hated me so bad, they wanted me gone. This time, they liked me too much to keep me around. <br/>Probst: Nicely done. Danielle, Danielle, you played a mighty game. You were in it... Danielle, you were in it until the end, and then you had  this breakdown at Tribal. You talked about how exhausted you were. Did you feel it coming on, or was it in retrospect that you were able to see  what happened? <br/>No, I felt it coming on. That day was just so stressful for me. I was... Russell was trying to get me voted off all day. And you know, I'm human. I have emotions, I have feeling, I have heart. And it just proved at the end of the day that I'm not a villain. So what can I say? I mean, I look back on it, and it kills me, 'cause I'm just like...  Probst: You were there. <br/>Oh, if I just kept it together, I was going to the end. But it is what it is. And, you know, I have to move on and, Russell, damn you. <br/>Probst: Courtney, one thing about you, Courtney, is you always seemed to be  having fun, even when it's miserable. Did you have as much fun this season? [men cheering] Courtney! <br/>Um, I had a lot of fun. I came in... I came back, and I had to, like, put myself in the space of,  really, are you going to do this now? And I was like, I'm going to go and have the best time that I possibly can  and enjoy it more than I did the first time. And I did. <br/>Probst: Randy, on the flip side...  I knew that was coming. <br/>Probst: You rarely seemed to be having any fun. Did you have any fun at all this time? <br/>No, not a bit. [laughter]  Probst: And Sugar, on the corner, you go to the end, and-- the first time and  then you're first out the second. <br/>Both sides of the rainbow. <br/>Probst: Yeah. Is it still an enjoyable experience when you only play three days? <br/>I was not having fun because it rained so much and I just didn't feel like I  had a decent alliance. <br/>Probst: One other thing I want to point out, another celebration, much like  Rob and Amber. Candice delayed... actually postponed your wedding to do this show. And now you came home-- I'm looking at a ring-- did you guys get married? <br/>We got married. <br/>Probst: Hold that up. Hold that up there. <br/>We got married May 1. My husband, John, he's the best. <br/>Probst: All right. Well, for over 20 seasons of Survivor,we've had 306 episodes, and we'veseen and  we've done a lot on this show. Take a look at some of these stats. Listen to this-- we've visited 15 countries. We've had over 300 people play this game. We've had nearly 500 challenges. Winners, we've had 11 men, nine women, average age 32. Twice as many single people win as married. And we're almost dead even when it comes to men and women and how long they  last in the game. So we thought it might be fun to create the Survivor prototype. So we combined all of the people who've won Survivor,and came up with the  ultimate player. And we put all these things together. We used a little bit from all of the winners, and take a look at this, guy. That is Richard Hatch's left eyebrow, that's Sandra's right eyebrow. That's the ear lobes of Parvati, the dimples of J.T., the bottom lip of Tom  Westman. We've got Ethan and Amber's in there in the nose. Anyway, if you know this guy or if you are this guy, come on to  Survivor,because you could win. When we come back, find out where Survivoris headed next. And first, we want to pay tribute to a dear friend and a former Survivorwho  passed away this year after a long struggle with cancer. with cancer. Jenn Lyon will be missed. Jenn Lyon will be missed.
