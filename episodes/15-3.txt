<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor ... At Fei Long, Jean-Robert slept while  everyone else worked. <br/>Jean-Robert, you need to start pulling your weight. He's a liability for the group. <br/>Probst: And Leslie began a downward spiral. <br/>The last few days, I have been really sick. If I can spend some time with God, it would be great. <br/>Probst: But at the reward challenge, Fei Long remained undefeated. Fei Long wins! At the challenge, a twist was revealed. Fei Long, because you defeated Zhan Hu, you now get to kidnap Zhan Hu, you  now get to kidnap one member of their tribe. one member of their tribe. Who are you going to kidnap? <br/>Jaime. <br/>Probst: Jaime, this is for you. It says, "open in private." Inside the bamboo tube was a clue to  the hidden immunity idol. <br/>"You must give this sealed clue to a member of this tribe before you  rejoin your own tribe."  Probst: And Jaime gave the clue to Leslie, lifting her spirits. <br/>I feel like the Lord, He really gave me a gift. <br/>Probst: At Zhan Hu, Dave used all his energy working around camp. And at the immunity challenge...  Pick it up, Dave! <br/>Probst: ...he had nothing left... Dave is worn out. ...helping Fei Long win their third challenge in a row. Fei Long wins immunity! When Zhan Hu returned to camp, Dave knew he was in the hot seat. <br/>I apologize. I feel like I let us down today. <br/>Start the fire...  Let me finish. <br/>The fire...  Let me finish. <br/>Probst: But his constant bickering with Ashley...  You're the leader, and I'll let you do what you want. <br/>How many fires have you built, sweetheart? ...put them both in jeopardy. At tribal council, the Zhan Hu tribe decided to give their hardest worker  another chance... The second person voted out of the Survivor: China... ...and  got rid of Ashley. Ashley, the tribe has spoken. 14 are left. 14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? [snoring]  Oh, gosh. [snoring]  Eww! <br/>Eww! Just, please don't. Just, please don't. <br/>Jean-Robert, God love him, he like, takes up the whole bed, and he's, like,  hugging on all the women and we're just like, "Eww, just please  don't." I don't know what it is about him. Maybe it's the silk shirt and the no underwear. the no underwear. That did it for me. That did it for me. <br/>I need to be warm. <br/>Look, will you stop snuggling so much because you're scaring the girls. [laughter]  I do get kind of a creep vibe from Jean-Robert and so does Amanda. Neither one of us likes him. I'm sure he's noticed she and I will both go to great pains to not be next to  him in the shelter, and yet he will just climb in there, and he's like,  "I need Amanda and Courtney by my side. They keep me warm." Like I'm going to keep anyone warm. I weigh seven pounds. I can't even keep myself warm. Get off of me. <br/>Call me creepy, if you want to, but I need to be warm. <br/>I don't think Jean-Robert gets the social game of Survivor. If we ever have to go to tribal council, at least we don't have to worry  about who it'll be to worry about who it'll be first because it'll be him. first because it'll be him. [theme song playing] Captioning sponsored by CBS and PARAMOUNT NETWORK CBS  and PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION TELEVISION  Are we going to eat the crab? <br/>Yeah, we're going to be eating the crab. Are you kidding me? We're going to be eating the crab. <br/>Make a stew. Crab stew. <br/>That looks like a big crab, man. <br/>Are you guys going to cook the crab? I think you should boil it because then it will be like crab stock and you  can put rice in it and it will be like a whole meal. <br/>You're not going to taste crabby rice from a crab that big. <br/>It's better than the rice with nothing we've been eating. <br/>The stock. <br/>The stock. It's about stretching with eight people. <br/>Stretching the crab? There's eight of us and one crab. <br/>Okay, okay, so there's only so much flavor in one crab. <br/>So, fine, James caught the crab so he gets to eat it and the rest of us have  plain rice. <br/>We don't work like that. It's not like you grab kindling and nobody gets to sit around the fire. <br/>The boys are just cranky. I know from experience, my husband, when he gets hungry, gets really cranky,  so I make sure that man is fed, okay? And these guys are not getting fed, so it's like my husband fed, so it's like  my husband times infinity. times infinity. <br/>I understand that. <br/>Nice crunchy and crispy right in my mouth. <br/>We only have one, so next time...  I know. I'm just saying this is what I would like. <br/>But I want the damn crab stock to put on the damn rice. <br/>Crab stock on the rice sounds good. <br/>Yeah, besides half a damn crab. Which you ain't even gonna get a half a crab; you'll get a crab toenail. <br/>That's cool. I'm down with you caught it and let's do what you want to do. <br/>All right, I'm with that, too. <br/>Damn. <br/>It's frustrating with this team because they have a slow learning curve. But it's hard to talk to these guys. They keep bumping their heads. I'm the only one that actually went to Barnes &amp; Noble before we got out  here. I'm the only one that actually went and read a survival handbook. <br/>Oh, yeah! <br/>I don't eat outside. I don't even like plastic or paper cups. I mean, I don't do nothing outside. Four hours at Barnes &amp; Noble and I know more than... I feel and I know  more than... I feel like Crocodile Dundee out here. like Crocodile Dundee out here. <br/>Dave, why don't you sit and eat? <br/>I will. <br/>I just want you to conserve your energy because I do not want to lose another  challenge. Dave doesn't seem to learn. He knew that last challenge was him just burning out of energy. And he doesn't seem to get it And he doesn't seem to get it that he needs to  rest. that he needs to rest. <br/>No, I'll do the first one. <br/>No, I'll do the first one. Someone can do the next one. Someone can do the next one. Peih-gee. Peih-gee. [kissing sound] [kissing sound] Peih-gee, I've heard you, thank you, I'm  checking myself constantly. Please. Cut me a wee bit of slack, you know what I mean? Peih-gee is just riding my butt about not getting enough rest. In order to save your energy and to have energy for a challenge, you must  efficiently expend some. It is a balance. Camp doesn't sort itself out. If you don't sort out camp, challenges will tank. It's not rocket science. <br/>We need to take better care  We need to take better care of our stuff. of our stuff. <br/>Just stick the wok through it. <br/>Maybe if we had two sticks it wouldn't tip. <br/>Okay, look at me. You've got a brick in the back and two bricks in the side. The fire's right here, right? <br/>Yeah, but the fire is smoldering out towards the front. It's not really in between the It's not really in between the bricks. bricks. <br/>Yeah, I don't know why you're getting a brick. We already have one. <br/>Well, we've got an extra one just in case. I can hem and haw and waffle about it all day long or just put a brick on it  and go. This is my whinge for the moment, and that's me and I'm done. So if you take offense, I apologize, but in the amount of time it took me to  get up, grab a brick and just do it versus the time it took to question it,  it just took so much more time and effort. <br/>The only thing that we were saying is that if you just, like, sat there for,  like, two more seconds, they already had the brick right there. <br/>Well, forgive me, I'm...  Erik, can you hand me some of that branch? <br/>Yeah, Dave's pushing a whole lot of people and he needs to chill out. We were looking at him and Ashley last night, and today of all days should be  the day when he should just be happy that he's here. <br/>I haven't even busted my ass, and I'm already done, you know what I mean? <br/>I know it's a game where it's everyone for himself, but I really do have a  lot of faith in our tribe, and you kind of have to look out for each other if  we want to do well at if we want to do well at challenges. challenges. challenges. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. Fei Long, your first look at the new Zhan Hu tribe. Ashley voted out last night. You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Today's challenge is going to be another physical confrontation. Three on three. You will start on opposite sides of a boat. On my go, you will engage in hand-to-hand battle. Your goal: throw the opposing tribe members off the boat into the water. First tribe to get all the tribe members of the other tribe into the water  scores a point. We will alternate, women on women, men on men. First tribe to get three points wins reward. You want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Comfort. [applause]  Yeah! <br/>We've got to win! <br/>Probst: Kerosene, a lantern, rope, pillows, blankets, and back here a big,  ugly, but functional tarp. <br/>Tarp! Yes! <br/>Come on, baby! <br/>Probst: Fei Long, you have two extra members. You're sitting two people out, one man, one woman. <br/>All right. <br/>Probst: Who's going to sit out? The little ones. <br/>The munchkins. <br/>Probst: Courtney and Todd sitting out. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize. minute to strategize. We'll get started. We'll get started. Okay, our first round is women on women. For Zhan Hu, we have Sherea, Peih-gee, Jaime. For Fei Long, we have Amanda, Leslie, Denise. Survivors ready? Survivors ready? Go! Go!

Sherea and Jaime taking on Amanda. Amanda is in the water. One woman left for Fei Long. Leslie in. Zhan Hu scores the first point. Zhan Hu leads 1-0. All right, men, take your spots. Dave is stripping down. <br/>Is he kidding me? <br/>Probst: It's either going to give him an advantage or make him very  vulnerable. For Zhan Hu, it's Frosti, Erik, and Dave. For Fei Long, James, Jean-Robert, Aaron. Zhan Hu leads 1-0. Survivors ready? Go. James saying, "Come on over. James saying, "Come on over. Come visit my boat." Come visit my boat." Dave and Aaron on the  gang plank. Dave like a little cat. This is odd. Dave attacks Aaron and pulls him in. <br/>Go, Dave! <br/>Probst: James tossing Frosti in. Erik is now taking on James and Erik is now taking on James and Jean-Robert. Jean-Robert. He's got no chance. Jean-Robert takes him in. James is the last man standing for Fei Long. We are tied 1-1.

Jaime and Sherea push Leslie in. Sherea now has Amanda by the leg. Peih-gee and Denise locking up. Jaime and Sherea have Amanda. <br/>Come on, girls, you can do it. <br/>Probst: Jaime pushing her head into the plank with her knee. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Amanda takes Sherea in with her. Amanda's out. Sherea is out. <br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah! <br/>Go! <br/>Probst: Jaime and Peih-gee push Denise in. Zhan Hu scores and leads 2-1. <br/>On! <br/>Probst: Zhan Hu leads 2-1, playing to three.

Dave taunting the one guy you don't want to taunt. James and Dave really going at it hard. Jean-Robert and Frosti. It is a melee. It could be the last person in. Dave is in, Frosti's in. Jean-Robert is in. Once again it's Erik wrapped around the post. Aaron and James working on him. <br/>It's okay, Erik! You got it! <br/>Probst: It is only a matter of time now. Aaron takes Erik in. James is the last man standing for Fei Long. Fei Long scores. We're tied 2-2. <br/>Come on, girls! <br/>Probst: It comes down to the women. If history repeats, Zhan Hu will win their first challenge. Survivors ready? Go. Jaime and Peih-gee making the move. Jaime going after Denise. Sherea locked up with Amanda. Peih-gee locked up with Leslie. This is it. For reward! Sherea pushing Amanda in.

[cheers] First win. All the comfort. In addition, because you won this challenge, you will now kidnap one member  of Fei Long. They will join you and live with you until the next immunity challenge. Who are you going to steal? <br/>Leslie. <br/>Probst: Leslie, cross right over here. over here. <br/>Bye, Mom. <br/>Bye, Mom. <br/>Probst: Leslie, this is for you. It says, "open in private." That's what it means. Find a private spot. Open it. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: That's all you need to know. Fei Long, I got nothing for you. Fei Long, I got nothing for you. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. <br/>Welcome home! <br/>Welcome home, little pillows! <br/>I'm so excited. Thanks. I was so excited to win the reward challenge. Not only did we get pillows and blankets and a tarp, we also able to kidnap  Leslie to our tribe. <br/>I'm really happy for you guys, I am. <br/>I appreciate that. <br/>And I mean it. <br/>You're genuine. You can tell. <br/>That's why we wanted you over here. <br/>That's why I'm going to watch my mouth and keep my drawers on just for you. I have been anyway, but I'll be even more so for you. <br/>We're so glad you're here. We have plenty of room for you. <br/>We'll make you a nice dinner. <br/>Morale-wise, this camp seems to have a leg up. And that's impressive because they've already lost two people. And for them to be still so excited, that's pretty impressive. impressive. [laughter] [laughter]  Ooh! <br/>Ooh! That hurt watching that. That hurt watching that. <br/>Yeah. You know what, though, I think we just have a lot of strong we just have a  lot of strong personalities. personalities. He's like my boy. He calls me mama. He calls me mama. Yeah, he's nice. Yeah, he's nice. <br/>He's nice, but he... he controls a lot. <br/>He's controlling, but we elected him leader. <br/>Why, is he really smart or something? <br/>He just kind of took over when we got there. <br/>We got quite a good bit of information from Leslie, but it was more in a kind  of fun, girls gossiping. You can get the same results, but you can do them in a happy, but you can do  them in a happy, nice way. nice way. <br/>Uh-huh. And Erik's a Christian and Jaime's a Christian. Wow. I'm misunderstood over in my tribe. My faith is everything. I'm here to love people and to show them the love of Christ, and I can see that  they appreciate that here. It differs a lot over at Fei Long. I try not to talk about it a lot over there. They're very cynical over there, and that can be really there, and that can  be really tough. tough. <br/>The old woman is not going to pull a rope. She's going to be hurt. <br/>Talking about Sister Christian? <br/>Yeah, Sister Christian. She ain't going to last too long. And for some reason, you're all buying that prayer stuff. <br/>Come on, dude. <br/>The people who pray the most sin the most. That's why they're praying. Because they know they're going to hell. [laughter]  You got your strategy all worked out, man? <br/>You need to stay, Denise needs to stay, and I need to stay for a while. <br/>I feel myself distancing from Todd. I felt kind of a bond with him right away, but he's, like, kind of tuned me  out. And Courtney, of course, I'm not in with. But I'm not worried about that because she's going to be first to go. <br/>You think? <br/>I mean, who else would be first to go? first to go? Denise or Courtney? Denise or Courtney? <br/>Courtney and I were cutting this husk for a fire off of a tree, and we were  literally, you know, 20 yards away from Jean-Robert and James, in full view,  and they were talking at the top of their lungs about how Courtney needs to  go first. I'm thinking, "Dude, she's right here."  Ooh! Another clam. <br/>Dude, who should we be voting, Leslie or Courtney? <br/>Courtney does work. <br/>What do you mean she's does work? What does she do? <br/>She moves stuff. <br/>Look at what she's moving. She's moving, like, two twigs. She's moving, like, two twigs. Plus, you like Courtney. Plus, you like Courtney. A million dollars is one thing but if you can get a million dollars and some  ass. Come on, James. You know you like that little 70-pound blonde. Come on, man. The only thing better than a million dollars is a million dollars and some  ass. Come on, now. <br/>The only thing better than a million dollars is a million dollars and a  sandwich. <br/>All right, you know what? Just for you, I'm going to look out for you. You stick with me, we're going to do all right. to do all right. So we'll go for Leslie. So we'll go for Leslie. <br/>Oh, my attitude towards the two of them is going to change around camp. Thank you, James. You've got to take care of taking out the trash. And as far as I'm concerned, James and Jean-Robert are the trash. <br/>All right, family. Family swim. Todd, you need to take your stinky ass in the water, too. <br/>I don't care if it's tomorrow. I don't care if it's five days from now. I don't care if it's nine days from now. Any more than that, trash gets stinky. stinky. They got to go. They got to go. <br/>Yesterday, at the reward challenge, Jeff Probst gave me a tube. I kind of knew what was in the tube because, when Jaime was kidnapped by our  camp, she had the same thing. "You must give the sealed clue to a member of this tribe before you  rejoin your own tribe at the next immunity challenge." Hey, guys. What I was thinking was, since Jaime gave me the clue from the other tribe, I  can return the favor. Is there a place I can go and change? <br/>Yeah, definitely. <br/>Like a place to...  You want me to go show you? <br/>You want me to go show you? <br/>Yeah, would you mind? <br/>Yeah, would you mind? <br/>I think I understand her. I think she understands me. And that's the best part. I'm picking up what she's putting down. putting down. This is a good thing. This is a good thing. <br/>I trust Leslie more than anyone else on the other team, so it was really good  to get her over here. And she gave me the clue for the hidden immunity idol. So altogether, it worked out really well for me. <br/>Yeah, these are closer. The longer part. <br/>"Hidden immunity idol clue number one. What is thought to be hidden may sometimes be seen. Though their eyes are not, yours must be keen. Hidden immunity idol clue number two: waste no more time in searching the  ground. Towards the heavens for what will be found." We have two clues, and I  can't figure out them quite yet. I don't know, I think it's something completely evident that no one's just even  paid attention to. I think it's probably right in I think it's probably right in front of my  face. front of my face. front of my face. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. Leslie, give me the lowdown. How was it spending time with Zhan Hu? <br/>Oh, they were great. We talked a lot, laughed a lot. It was fun. We had a good time. <br/>Probst: All right, time to rejoin Fei Long. <br/>Have fun, you guys. <br/>Have fun, you guys. Thank you. Thank you. <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: First things first,  Probst: First things first, take back the immunity idol. take back the immunity idol. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will designate four choppers, two puzzle builders. The four choppers will race one at a time to cut through wooden beams  concealing ropes, releasing a bundle of wooden disks. When you have the disks, you'll race back to your tribe. The next person will go. Once you've retrieved all four bundles, the remaining two tribe members must  then stack those disks in the correct order on a puzzle pole with a very  heavy stone base. You must then drag the completed puzzle across the finish line. First tribe to finish wins immunity, safe from tribal council. Losers, somebody voted out tonight. Fei Long, you have two extra members. Cannot sit out the same people in back-to-back challenges, which means Todd  and Courtney will participate in this challenge. Who you sitting out? <br/>We're going to sit out Denise and Leslie. <br/>Probst: Denise and Leslie are going to sit out. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategy. minute to strategy. We'll get started. We'll get started. Here we go. For immunity, survivors ready? For immunity, survivors ready? Go! Go! Jaime first out for Zhan Hu. Jaime first out for Zhan Hu. Courtney first out for Fei Long. Courtney first out for Fei Long. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Swing it in there! <br/>Keep going, Courtney. <br/>Concentrate! <br/>All right, all right, keep it up! <br/>Probst: Once you cut through all seven ropes, you'll release the bundle of  disks. <br/>Yeah! [applause]  Yeah! [applause]  Probst: Jaime has her first bundle of disks. Peih-gee now out on the course. <br/>I'm sorry, guys. <br/>That's all right, sweetie, just keep going. <br/>Come on, Courtney. You gotta do it for us. Come on, baby. <br/>Probst: Peih-gee with only three ropes left. Peih-gee working on that last rope. There it is, chop it down. Peih-gee has the second bundle for Zhan Hu. <br/>Damn. <br/>How are they doing this? <br/>Just keep going! Don't look at them. <br/>Frosti, ninja man. <br/>Probst: Frosti wasting no time, attacking it. Courtney still working on Fei Long's first station. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: Frosti, one swing and he has his bundle. Zhan Hu now with three bundles. <br/>Come on, Erik! <br/>Probst: Erik starts to work on his ropes. <br/>Sorry. <br/>Probst: Courtney, there is a long puzzle to complete. Do not give up. Erik ripping through these ropes. One more, there it is. Zhan Hu has all four bundles. They can start work on their puzzle. <br/>Keep chopping, keep chopping. That's good. Slice it, yes, like that, slice it. <br/>Probst: Courtney, sawing through it now. One chop left. <br/>Big whack, big whack! You have to saw through it. <br/>That one. <br/>Probst: Courtney has her first bundle! <br/>Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go! <br/>Let's go, Amanda! <br/>Probst: Dave and Sherea not having a lot of luck with the puzzle. It's going very slowly. <br/>Eight, eight. <br/>Probst: Amanda working through the rope quickly. <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>Amanda, you go, girl! <br/>Probst: Amanda has the second bundle for Fei Long. Fei Long back in it now. Aaron goes to town. Zhan Hu having no luck on that puzzle. <br/>Upside down. Can it be upside down? Okay. <br/>Probst: Aaron quickly through five ropes, six, and seven. Here it comes. Fei Long is back in this challenge. <br/>All right, you all speed it up a little bit. <br/>Let's go, James! <br/>Probst: That is why you never quit. James has it. Fei Long has all four bundles. They can start work on their puzzles. <br/>Go, go. <br/>Probst: Zhan Hu has given up nearly all of their lead. <br/>You got it, baby! <br/>Probst: Which tribe chose the right people to do the right part of the  challenge? <br/>There you go! <br/>Probst: Todd making quick  Probst: Todd making quick work, working with Jean-Robert. work, working with Jean-Robert. Zhan Hu seems to have a rhythm now. <br/>Get that off my finger! <br/>Probst: Sherea and Dave working together, not panicking. <br/>Got it. <br/>What the hell, dude? <br/>Probst: Zhan Hu has the puzzle completed. They've just got to drag it across the finish line. <br/>Yeah! Whoo! Go! Go! <br/>Probst: This puzzle is very heavy. <br/>Come on, girl! <br/>Probst: Zhan Hu on their way  Probst: Zhan Hu on their way to their first immunity win. to their first immunity win. to their first immunity win. Zhan Hu wins immunity! Zhan Hu wins immunity! [cheers]  Oh, my god, girl! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh! Oh! <br/>Probst: Congratulations, Zhan Hu. For the first time, immunity will be going back to camp with you. <br/>Yes! <br/>It will look good on our fireplace. <br/>Probst: And for the first time, Fei Long will be going to tribal council  tonight, where one of the eight of you will be voted out. voted out. Head on back to camp. Head on back to camp. <br/>Did you hurt your shoulder, too? <br/>Yeah. <br/>You did really well, baby doll. <br/>Yes, she did. <br/>You didn't give up, which is key. <br/>We almost had them at the end. <br/>We did. <br/>Losing today's challenge and yesterday's challenge just kind of reaffirms the  fact that we need strength. We need brawn on our team. So, I think common sense will prevail and they're going to be getting rid of  one of the two weakest women on the squad. <br/>It's horrible. They sting. <br/>What's up with the other tribe? <br/>I think they're all, like, friendly over there. It's a very friendly tribe. Three of them are Christians over there, which is I think why they picked me. Three of them are Christians. <br/>Which ones? <br/>Sherea and Jaime and Erik. <br/>What did they think about us? <br/>They didn't really know a whole lot about you. I told them little bits about you guys. I said Aaron's our leader, whether he likes it or not. They knew. They could tell. <br/>You put my head in the guillotine. <br/>No, I didn't, they knew! <br/>They knew? <br/>They knew! Jaime told them. Come on. <br/>Leslie going over to Zhan Hu, being kidnapped, major liability for us. You know, she doesn't, she doesn't think, you know, because I don't know if  it's her heart or what, just overcomes her brain. But really what scares me is once the merge happens, you know, what kind of bond  is Leslie going to be involved with because you can't, can't with because you  can't, can't really trust her. really trust her. <br/>I mean, I'm trying, and the thing is, if we had a nice camp, I think I could  put up with the challenges and this. But, like, our camp is miserable. <br/>You mean the people? <br/>Yeah. <br/>So if we didn't have Jean-Robert, how would that change your life? <br/>Jean-Robert and James have to go. <br/>We ought to bust those two up. <br/>So you guys are going for Jean-Robert, right? <br/>Yes, I mean, I promised I would. <br/>Okay, I'm go to leave you guys. guys. I just wanted to... I just wanted to...  We ought to break those two up. They're causing trouble. But, Courtney, I'm worried But, Courtney, I'm worried about you. about you. <br/>We have to think about later  We have to think about later in the game. in the game. <br/>She'll be a vote for us. We need her. Do you really think we'll lose a lot of challenges without Jean-Robert? It's not like we're getting rid of James and Aaron. of James and Aaron. So... So...  I don't want to vote Jean[1]Robert  out because of the Robert out because of the challenges. challenges. You know, people will try and find, you know, the tie that binds, you know,  so... I want to be around a while. I don't want to go to the I don't want to go to the merger and get picked off. merger and get picked off. <br/>He can easily, easily, jump over to someone else's side...  I'm sure. <br/>...and pick us off one by one to get him one step further. <br/>Right, and I just feel Leslie is more dangerous than Jean-Robert in that  jumping way. So we need to take her out. <br/>Right now, it would be between Leslie and Jean-Robert, but further down the  line, I don't want to be competing, me up against these huge guys. I don't want to lose my numbers on my tribe by getting rid of them now, but  down the line, I don't want them here because they're going to beat me, and  that's not okay. <br/>Tonight we're going to have a vote, and the logical choice for us to let  someone go is to let one of our two weaker players go. Which, obviously, is Courtney and Leslie. Leslie seems to be breaking down every single day, and then Courtney,  seriously, even if she makes it past today or, I don't see how this girl is  going to live 30 days. I've seen anorexic girls have more meat on their bones than this girl has. To me, we're just lucky they didn't tell us one girl and one guy have to sit  out today. That would have been really brutal. <br/>How are your hands? <br/>This game is not just physical right now. I'm trying to think strategically as well. It does bug me that Leslie was so excited to go over to the other tribe. And, yeah, who knows what she's plotting with people over there. And... I don't know. I want to get rid of Jean-Robert but at the same time, as far as challenges  go, I want to keep Jean-Robert. I want to keep Jean-Robert. But who knows? But who knows? <br/>Probst: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch. Approach the flame. This is part of the ritual of tribal council because in this game, fire  represents your life. As long as you have fire, you're still in the game. When your fire is gone, so are you. That will be the case for one That will be the case for one of you tonight. of you tonight. So, let's talk about the challenges. You guys started off very strong. Three wins in a row. Then, back-to-back losses. Zhan Hu knows they can beat this tribe. Jean-Robert, a little concerned? <br/>Very concerned. You know, you look at our group, and, yeah, we might have two of the three  biggest guys in the whole thing, but we also have two of the weakest girls,  and that's just, that's just a matter of fact. <br/>Probst: Who are the two weak? Obviously, you're going to be pointing to Courtney because she's the smallest. <br/>Courtney and Leslie is who I am referring to. <br/>This is fun to live with. <br/>This is the reality of the situation. This is our team. So we should be very careful who we sit out so we're left with a more  balanced team each time. <br/>Probst: Courtney, that can't feel good to hear. <br/>For the past nine days, it's like how can we possibly get Courtney and Todd  and Leslie to not play. And I'm like a little Chihuahua trying to run a horse race so far. Everything is like mud wrestling, or like winging people off a boat. They're like, "Crap, we have to put her in. Where will she do the least damage?" And I'm like, "I don't give a  crap." I'm just sick of being spoken of, like, "Where will you do  the least damage in this challenge?"  That's not what we were thinking. <br/>That's how it comes across day after day. <br/>It's not that I perceive Leslie as weak or Courtney as weak. To be honest...  Probst: Jean-Robert, that is exactly what you said. <br/>Okay, the weaker of this group. It's the reality of the situation. I'm not going to sugarcoat it. When it comes to the three strongest girls, it is clearly Denise, Amanda and  then who? We're playing for a million dollars here. We're not babies in a campground. Feelings are going to get hurt or they're not going to get hurt. I'm not known for holding my thoughts back. I'm going to say exactly what I think but I'm keeping it real. <br/>Can I say something? I spent a night with Zhan Hu. And I saw not a strong physical tribe but a strong heart. They're united. They do things together. They have fun. You know, we may have all the brawn in the world, but if we don't have heart,  we're not going to make it. Those people won that challenge because of this, not because of this. <br/>Probst: Jean-Robert, you at all concerned it might be you tonight? <br/>Well, of course I'm concerned it could be me. To be honest with you, Jeff, the heat's been on since day two. And somehow, the last few days, I've shown a little bit more, and I've pretty  much kicked some butt in the challenges. So tonight, my chances are a little bit fair, but I'm still in jeopardy. I would say I'm definitely one of the two or three people that's in jeopardy  in this tribe and I'm really hoping to make it through tonight. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to vote. time to vote.

I chased the dream, and I would have liked to have been here longer, of  course, but I always knew going into this game that I would be here as long  as God wanted me to be here. Apparently, He's ready for me to go home. I don't understand why they vote me out, but I really hope that my tribe made  the right decision. It had to have been a tough one for them. But I had a great time. I would do it again in a I would do it again in a heartbeat.
