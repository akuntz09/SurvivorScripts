<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor." after the merge, Rodney had control  of the majority alliance and a secret alliance with will, Tyler and Carolyn.  I’m always riding with numbers, baby. Hey, looking beautiful for Rodney,  isn't it?  Jeff: For Joe, it was a different story, his no collars and Shirin were on  the bottom.  We're together 100%. We have been since the beginning. We plan on staying  that way, as far as I know.  Jeff: And even though he found the clue to the hidden immunity idol, the  majority alliance wouldn't let him out of their sight.  He's got the clue. I have to find Joe before he finds the idol so we can send  this guy home and it's not me.  Jeff: But it was Mike who beat him to the punch. At tribal council  ---flippers never win.  It's like a fear tactic he's using against his alliance.  Jeff: Sparks flew between Dan and Shirin. Eighth person voted out and the  first member of our jury, Hali. But it was Hali who was sent home. Hali, the  tribe has spoken. Ten are left. Who will be voted out tonight?  I don't understand how a fan like you can't know the difference between a  flip and a blindside.  Dan, you're so right. You know so much more than me.  You're right, little miss know it all. You know everything.  I am definitely on the wrong side of the numbers, but the hope is that blue  collar will start fracturing sooner rather than later, because I still think  I can go to the end. But the only way I’m going to a move against the others?  And if they are, I will benefit from that. So all I can do is shake things  up.  Well, Mike, when you go to the very end, I’m voting for you to win.  That's because you will be on the jury.  I will be on the jury and I’m voting for Mike to win.  I don't believe Dan when he said flippers don't win the game, flippers win  the game on the right time. They think I’m blue to the end. I don't need no  more friends. I need zeros in my bank account. I’m going the take down the blues.  Mike, Sierra and Dan, they ain't going to see it coming. I’m waiting for my  time. They ain't going to see it coming. I’m going to hit them with a Mike  tyson knock-out punch. [thunder]  holy crap.  The girls are all whatever. I’m kind of stoked now to get voted out.  Jenn was so close with Hali, and now she doesn't want to be here. I don't  harbor any resentment toward Jenn wanting to quit this game because I completely  understand why she dislikes these people, but for selfish reasons, I want her  to stay because I want to stay in the game and I want to go far. I need to  prove myself to gain a new alliance. My numbers are done. My back's up  against the wall. So I need a new option. I want to work with you guys.  I would be willing to entertain that thought. But I would have to be able to  thurst you. Pulling Shirin in, because no one would think I would pull her  in, is a perfect strategy to get rid of some of these other threats that are  in this game. Let me ask you who would be your number one to go out of this  game.  I would actually say Carolyn. Carolyn's got will in her pocket. She's got Rodney  and Tyler is with her.  Yeah, I can see that, as well.  That's four people.  Shirin's smart enough to realize there's a group within our group. Well, I see  it. You can't hide. There's only ten people here. If we were to come up with  a name at tribal and you were to write that name down...  I’m in.  The biggest thing right now is to hitch my vote on to somebody else's game  plan and just go along with whatever they say for next vote, but once I’m in  and once people trust me, maybe I’m not in the driver's seat right away, but I’m  in the passenger seat back seat driving.  Jeff: All right. You guys ready to get to today's reward challenge?  Yes.  Jeff: Here's how it works. You'll be divided into two teams of five. One  person at a time will race through a series of obstacles. Once you reach a  platform, the next person goes. Once you have all five people at the  platform, one person from each team uses a grappling hook to retrieve rings  floating in the water. First team to collect all five wins reward. Want to  know what you're playing for?  Absolutely.  Jeff: Prepare to be happy. You will be taken to the chocolat cafeã. Featuring m&amp;ms, snickers,  twix, dove.  Dove chocolate!  Jeff: You will spend a relaxing afternoon satisfying your hunger with some of  your favorites from home. Now, I’m going to whet your appetite by reminding  you just how pleasurable m&amp;ms can be by letting you each taste one.  Everybody go. I don't want to hold you back.  Chocolate on chocolate, baby.  Oh, wow.  Committee.  Right.  Jeff: Okay. We're going to do a schoolyard pick, which means you guys will  decide who matches up. Let's do it. We did a schoolyard pick. It is Mike, Tyler,  Shirin, Dan and Sierra. The other tribe is Rodney, Joe, Jenn, Carolyn and  will. Here we go, for reward. "Survivor" ready? Go! It is Mike and Rodney  to see who will get reward. Both giving 100%. Mike is up and down first. Rodney  right behind. Mike's diving into that net. Rodney now flying. Both guys  ripping through this. Mike now to the balance beam. Rodney on the balance  beam. Oh, Rodney with a big bop and he makes it.  Go, blue!  Jeff: Go, red! Will in the water for the red team. Dan in the water for the  blue team.  You're okay. Nice and easy.  Will, don't worry about him. Go as hard as you can. Focus.  Go, baby. Jump.  Jeff: Oh, huge fall by Dan.  Go, will!  Jeff: Wow. Two of thesã£u5eã awkward slides in the history of "Survivor." Dan now  on the net crawl. Will now diving into that net crawl. Will back in the  water. This is an awkward thing to watch. Dan now on the balance beam. And he  makes it across. Will makes it across just barely. Go, blue! Tyler in the  water. Go, red!  Go, go, go.  Jeff: Carolyn in the water. It is Tyler. He heads down the slide.  Go, Carolyn, go!  Jeff: Tyler nice work over the net. Blue now with the lead. Carolyn trying  the catch up. Tyler now at the balance beam. Oh, did not make it. Got to go  back. Tyler got to swim back. Carolyn falls in. She's got to go back. Tyler  now going for a second run. There it is. Tyler makes it the second time. Carolyn  falls off. Go, blue! Blue in the lead. Carolyn with her third attempt on the  balance beam.  Come on, Carolyn.  Jeff: And that's all it took. Carolyn swims back now. Go, red!  Go.  Jeff: Jenn in the water now for red. It's Shirin in for blue.  Come on. Hustle, girl.  Jeff: Shirin slides down. Jenn is now down the slide. Shirin into the net  crawl. No problem. Jenn into the net crawl. She's got no problem. Both women  swimming to the balance beach. Shirin and Jenn neck and neck. Jenn has made  up some time on Shirin. Easy for Jenn. Red now in the lead. Shirin, no. Can't  do it. Got to go back. Go, red! Red with a big lead. Shirin losing a lot of  time. Joe up and over. Joe runs down.  Come on, Joe!  Jeff: Shirin trying again. And she makes it across. Joe the fifth and final  person for the red team. Joe makes it. Go, blue! Sierra in the water for  blue. Red still working. Now to the second part of this challenge. There are  five rings. Got to get all five back. Sierra is at the wall now. She's trying  to make up some time for blue. Joe taking over now on the grappling hook.  Just misses. Sierra's got to get across that beam.  Nice save, nice save.  Jeff: Sierra does it. Sierra's back for blue. We're dead even again. Mike now  on the grappling hook for blue. Joe going to give it up to Carolyn. Mike  snags the first ring. Four left for blue.  Faster, baby. You got to go faster.  Jeff: Carolyn snags one for red. We're tied 1-1. It is Sierra now taking over  for blue. She's got it. Blue leads 2-1. Jenn tossing for red. Beautiful toss.  Can she turn it into a hook? Yes. Red has their second. We're tied 2-2. Mike  with a great toss snags a third ring for blue.  Good job, Mike!  Jeff: Blue back in the lead, 3-2.  This is back and forth now.  Jeff: She's got it. We're tied 3-3. They've been neck and neck this entire  challenge. Mike snags the fourth ring. Does he have it hooked? Yes. Blue back  in the lead. 4-3. Blue has one ring left. Joe looking for the fourth. Can he  hook it? Hanging on, trying to keep that hook on the ring. Got to get it on  there to get it back. Oh, had it. Missed opportunity for red. Mike got the  distance, can he line it up and grab it from behind he might have it.  Incredible. Blue wins reward at the chocolat cafeã! [cheering]ã³l all right, Dan, Shirin,  Tyler, Mike, Sierra, I think that's the biggest celebration i've seen in this  game, even with immunity challenges.  I've been dreaming about snickers since day one out here on this island. And  we've got some pictures.  Jeff: Jenn, what's the feeling for you?  Um, I don't know how people can understand what this feeling is unless you're  out here, unless you've been here for almost a month, being in a place that  you don't necessarily want to be in. This is nothing that most people want,  unless you've played this game, you have no idea what this feels like.  Jeff: Joe, you're shaking your head.  I don't know, maybe I feel a little differently. You know, this is what we  signed up for. You knew that we were going to be out here, and we're not  getting every little delicious treat that we get back home, but I’m still  happy to be here. I mean, maybe not the same for her, but this is part of the  game.  Jeff: Dan, Shirin, Tyler, Mike, Sierra, going to bring the boat in, going to  take you over. Rodney, Jenn, will, Carolyn, Joe, got nothing for you. Grab  your stuff.  Oh, dear lord.  Oh, my god.  Are you kidding me in  you guys.  I want one of those. I want one of those. We walk up to a chocolate bar, just  bar, bar, bar of chocolate.  Oh, look at the big one.  There was snickers, twix, every color of m&amp;ms, big dove candy, hundreds  of candy bars. It was amazing.  I’m digging in on the snix.  Opening that snickers and smelling that caramel-y peanut-y goodness brought  me back to my childhood. It's really strange out here when you are so  deprived of the little amenities how much a snickers' bar truly means to you.   I love literally every one of you. Way to go.  I am the luckiest person out here right now considering where I was coming from  the previous night's tribal council to all of a sudden winning this chocolate  paradise award and having a door open strategically with Mike and Sierra,  it's literally night and day. I see the game from a new angle and now I’m  charging forward.  Fried chicken tonight.  We're going to be eating better than them.  Not winning again, I’m like, you know what, the worst thing I can do is to  sulk in another loss and to get mad that I didn't get a reward.  Me and Jenn, we've lost.  So what I need to do, we have to look at the positive thing. We have a  chicken here. We're going to eat because my stomach needs to take something  different other than rice and beans.  Let's get fire going and we'll have chicken and rice. Sound good?  Jenn doesn't like killing the chicken and I guess she wanted them as her  little buddies because she lost her buddy Hali and she maybe talked to the  chickens or those are her little friends.  She'll get over it. Life goes on.  This would suck less if the people sucked less. No one asked me if we could  kill a chicken, even though they're pretty much my chickens at this point.  Then they just grabbed one of my chickens and ran off. None of this is fun.  I've got nothing out here except for despair.  Oh, my god. I miss chicken so much, man.  Doing the same damn thing with the same damn people, but you wonder who them  people going to be. Jeff, I think I’m on the chopping block tonight. My name  came up six times tonight, Jeff. It could be me going. You never know.  Oh, my god. Nailed it! Nailed it!  Well, you know, Jeff, it comes back to a story of me and my friends in maine.  [laughter]  keep going. Don't stop.3w[1]don't  stop, man.  Jeff, you got to appreciate good people when you come by them.  I agree.  I agree. I agree 110% with Dan.  150,000%.  I didn't know you were this good at impression, Rodney.  I’m here with Rodney and there's a part of him that doesn't like Mike, and if  I can use that to my advantage, absolutely I’m going to fricken use it. So  hopefully I can work a little magic and stay in the game a little longer.  There's going to be a lot of lies and betraying because you never know.  Tree mail.  Okay. Read it. Read it.  One by one, flames get snuffed. That's just the way it goes. To ensure you're  not the next one the leave, you better keep on your toes.  Game on, people. Game on.  Going into the immunity challenge, I feel a ton of pressure. I have really  nobody out here, but I’m going to give it all I got and try to get a win. I’m  3-0. Hey, let's make it 4-0.  Me, Joe and Shirin are all at the bottom. The more I ask to leave, the less  likely I am the leave. If they're going to keep me around, i'll give them a  reason to kick me out. If it goes down to us two, i'll give you the necklace  at tribal.  You want to go really?  Yeah. I don't want to be here. I would give it to you the second we got the  tribal, and it would be hilarious.  I believe you.  But you'd rather win.  I love you, girl. I really wish you'd change your mind.  Jenn said, if I win, i'll give you the immunity challenge and go home. She's  that set on leaving. Hopefully she'll stick to it because it will double my  chances of winning today at the immunity challenge. Love you.  Love you too, Joe.  Jeff: Come on in, guys. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?  Absolutely.  Jeff: First things first, Joe, taking it back.  Takes it away.  Jeff: Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's chang, you're  going to balance on your toes with a block wedged between your head and the  top of a frame. The longer the challenge goes, the more fatigued your legs  will become. When the block falls, you're out. Last person left standing wins  immunity guaranteed a one in nine shot at winning this game. Losers go the  tribal council where somebody will be the ninth person voted out and the  second member of our jury. Draw for spots. We'll get started. All right.  Everybody is in place. Everybody drop your hands off the structure. You  cannot touch the structure. Everybody looks good. Here we go for immunity.d0  this challenge is on. This is all about endurance. It's going to hurt and  it's going to hurt fast. Joe struggling early. Has not lost an individual  challenge. Joe is 3-3 but early he is struggling in this one. Regains his  balance. Carolyn a little wobbly. And Carolyn is the first out of this  challenge. Carolyn gently so you don't disturb the others sit down on your  frame. Will drops out. Just like that Carolyn is out. Will is out. We are  down to eight. Shirin drops. She is out. We are down to seven. Stay focused.  Because if you drift, you will drop. That's how it goes. You want to drop  only when you have exhausted every bit of your energy because tonight might  be the tribal you need to survive. Joe struggling again. A lot of movement  with that block for Joe, but he's recovered again. And still in it. Rodney  starting to slip. He's right on tension of his frame. Rodney is out of the  challenge. That's how fast it can happen. One little movement, the block  moved, he was out. Dan is out. Be mindful of the others.  Seriously. Stop. God. Joe's block now is really in an awkward spot. He's  using the top of his skull, but he's only got the edge of the block trying to  maneuver it back. That cannot be comfortable, the position he's in. Sierra is  out. And we are down to four. Joe's been wobbling this entire challenge, but  he's still in it. Nobody has won an individual challenge in this game this  season. Other than Joe. Got to be a lot of people who would like to see him  fail today. Joe is out. Joe no chance of continuing his streak. Joe for the  first time since the merge vulnerable tonight at tribal council. And we're  down to three. It is Jenn, Tyler and Mike. Fittingly, a no collar, a white  collar and a blue collar. Mike's body starting to shake a little bit,  starting to twitch. Tyler now starting to twitch a bit. Starting to show the  early signs of fatigue. Your body starting to move a little bit. Jenn very  solid. Has not wavered since this challenge began. Mike wobbling. Mike cannot  recover. Mike with no shot at immunity tonight. It is now Jenn and Tyler  fighting for immunity on day 24. Still looking very strong, like statues.  Been up there 30 minutes now.  Outstanding.  Awesome.  Jeff: A long time to stand in this position. Jenn a little bit of movement in  her head. That's where it gets Dangerous. Jenn going to have to dig in right  now. Tiny little twitches have worked their way up to the top.  Keep fighting, y'all.  Jeff: Tyler fighting through it, still twitching but still strong. Only thing  that matters is that block stays between your head and the top of the frame.  As long as it does, you're still in this. You know how fast somebody can drop  out of this. It can happen in a moment. Jenn starting to wobble. Cannot  recover. Tyler wins individual immunity. He's safe tonight at tribal council.   Good job, Jenn. That was awesome.  Jeff: You're going to feel that for a few days. Tyler come on over. Tyler  safe tonight at tribal council, guaranteed a 1-9 shot at winning this game.  As for the rest of you, 24 days on "Survivor" is tough. For  somebody that will be the end of the road. Tribal council tonight, ninth  person voted out, second member of our jury. Grab your stuff, head back to  camp, see you tonight at tribal.  Is it really sad that I fought so hard in that challenge today so I could  have a ticket out? Everyone is going to vote for Joe, but I really think that  I could do something to protect him and screw up everyone else's game.  I lost so I was rooting for Jenn. I was like, come on, Jenn, keep goingment  but it didn't work out. So, you know, at this point I’m living on the edge  again. I’m living on a limb. I know I’m on the chopping block, but I’m going  to fight. I’m going the fight until the bitter end.  I can't believe I sucked so bad at that challenge.  Everyone's going to vote for you.  Exactly.  Nobody knows the game as well as I do. I’m running the numbers constantly.  And I figured out the numbers loophole.  I’m playing it.  Because of the hidden immunity idol and because of the way the numbers shake  out with seven people in the blue alliance and three people on the out, the  blue alliance can and will split their vote. But if Joe votes for Jenn,  there's a 4-4 tie between Joe and Jenn. Jenn can't vote for herself and she's  not going to vote for Joe because she wants to go home, that leaves me as a  swing vote to decide between Joe and Jenn going home.  It will probably be four him, four you?  Look at the dreamy look in your eyes.  But could you?  If Shirin and Joe vote for me, everyone gets screwed over because I keep Joe  in the game. It sounds pathetic to ask people to vote for you, but I don't  care.  I'd say 4-3.  Okay.  Is that what you're thinking? It's simple. Done, right in  yeah, 4-3.  Wherever she goes today, I’m going to be attached.  That's easy.  The scary thing about splitting the vote is literally one person could make  the difference in who you want to go home and the goat going home. So I want Shirin  to vote Joe tonight in order to get Joe out of this game. We are definitely  splitting the vote, and you're voting for Joe. You know what I’m saying.  Yeah.  But I have to trust you.  Yeah.  He could vote Jenn and then Jenn goes home. So the more votes we have for Joe  the better.  Yeah. The thought of voting between Joe and Jenn, on the one hand, I never  thought i'd be in a position to vote for an actual friend of mine out of this  game. Even though she wants it, I want to respect her wishes and let her  leave this game in peace, but the opposite point of view is that Joe is a  much bigger threat.  The next vote is going to determine whether we go to the final four or not.  I am being tested, and little does everyone know that I could really rock the  boat tonight.  I don't have the real hidden immunity idol and everyone was watching me, but  I have a little back-up plan. Just get a little time by myself outside of  camp, I have everything I need to make a fake idol.  I just want to make my plea that I really, really want to be here.  There's nothing I could do to swing everybody.  Yeah.  You know? I’m sorry.  Don't be. You have nothing to be sorry about. You have nothing to be sorry  about.  Thanks, brother.  I've been having this idea to make a fake hidden immunity idol. I have my  little stash that I set up. This is a piece of wooden crate. I have pieces  from my torch. I make jewelry, so I’m going to make a fake idol.  Where's Joe in  Joe's gone.  Joe's gone?  Cannot let him find this idol.  I’m going to go check my secret spot.  Go to the river across.  Hey.  Come here for a second.  At this point in the game, the more confusion that you can throw, the better.  And if no one else has found the actual hidden immunity idol, than this is  golden. This is sellable.  You all are going to split the vote.  Walk me through a scenario that works. &gt;&gt;ly vote Jenn if you guarantee  me that the numbers will swing in my favor tonight, send her home, I will  give you my idol.  I would have to have the idol before tribal.  That's the thing. I have the idol in my pocket at tribal, and you flip your  vote, I give you the idol tomorrow.  If you give me the idol, I’m not going to send you home.  I have the hidden immunity idol to his clue that he got. But if he has a  different hidden immunity idol, you give it to me tonight, you know what,  legitimately, I would switch my vote. Maybe.  Jeff: We now bring in the first member of our jury. Haley voted out at the  last tribal council. All right. So I want to start with the immunity  challenge. Jenn, I was surprised how well you did because I still can't  figure out if you are enjoying your time out here or not. One minute you're  apathetic. I don't care, I just need some chocolate, no one likes me. The  next minute you're hanging in there almost winning immunity. Can you not want  to be here and want to be here?  Yes. Absolutely. There's a lot of unexpected things in this game, and it's  just certain parts I really don't enjoy, but certain parts I really do. Like  I didn't think Rodney -- anything of Rodney, now he's one of the funniest,  craziest people I know, so I’m constantly like... I don't like this but I really  do like, this and I wanted to win individual immunity for many reason, but  one of them was that would be really cool to get that necklace.  Jeff: What would you do with that necklace, since you don't really care?  I would give it to Joe. Just to see the look on everyone else's faces, because  they would all be so pissed.  Jeff: Why Joe? Why will that be entertaining?  Because they're all voting for him. 100%. The second Joe doesn't win  immunity, everyone is voting for Joe.  Jeff: But had you won immunity, you would have given it to him so he would  still be here?  Absolutely. 100%.  Why don't you do the latest no collar move of all, get up and walk out.  That's quitting. I don't quit.  Jeff: Joe, how does it sit with you. You were this close to having immunity  because Jenn almost beat Tyler.  I was rooting for her the whole time because I want to be here. I want to  play. I have waited my whole life to be here. And I’m not ready to go. I mean,  Jenn, she's already quit mentally, emotionally, physically, she's not going  to strategize, she's just kind of getting pulled along for the ride now  because someone might say, I want to sit next to Jenn at the end because she  . Even play the game. And I love this game too much to just not fight for it.  And, yeah, I would have to win the next nine immunity challenges to get close  to that goal, but at least i'd make it fun.  Jeff: Shirin, as a massive fan, how does this sit with you? You have one  person saying she wouldn't have cared if you voted her out, but not willing  to fall on the sword and walk out now.  Yeah, she doesn't want to be here, but I completely understand why. Like,  from my point of view, i've actual listen been able to strategize  exceptionally well with Jenn in a way that I haven't totally connected with Joe.  Everybody else here wants Joe out. They see him as a bigger threat, and it's  to my benefit to have her stay and to have Joe go because she's a better  strategic ally to me, but the fact that she says she doesn't want to be here  makes me look less threatening, makes them want to keep her over me.  Jeff: All right.  Jeff, I have a question, can you verify something for me? Is this a hidden  immunity idol?  Jeff: I cannot verify that until you decide to play it. Well, the determining  factor if somebody stays here tonight or if they go home. Okay. It is time to  vote. Tyler, you're up.  I have no idea what's going on.  I have no idea what's going to happen tonight.  Jenn, girl, hopefully my idol play bought me one more vote and it's you and  not me.  Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you  want to play it, now would be the time to do so.  I’m going to play this for will.  Thank you.  Jeff: This is not a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for will will still  count. I'll read the votes. First vote Jenn. Joe. Jenn. Joe. Dan. Two votes Jenn.  Two votes Joe. One vote Dan. Jenn. That's three votes Jenn. Joe. Tied again.  Three votes Jenn, three votes Joe, one vote Dan. Jenn. That's four votes Jenn.  Joe. Four votes Jenn, four votes Joe, one vote Dan, one vote left. Ninth  person voted out and the second member of our jury, Joe. You need to bring me  your torch. Joe, the tribe has spoken.  Thanks, Jenn. Love you all, good luck.  Love you, Joe.  That's, Joe.  Jeff: Well, tonight's vote illustrates a very basic "Survivor" strategy  -- take out a threat whenever you can, which means if you are perceived as a  threat, you better watch out. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good  night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.  Jeff: Next time on "Survivor"...  All you've been doing is running your damn mouth. Will blows up on Shirin.  But it's Mike who could blow up the game.  He flipped.  Who did I flip on?  Whack job, you're ruining it for yourself.  You're going nuts right now. You better relax, bro. You better relax.  I tried to stay in this game as long as humanly possible. It's hard the leave  the game when I feel like I have so much game left to play. But it is a game.  And I guess it's a little bit of an indirect compliment that everybody wanted  me out. It's bittersweet, but every single second was worth it out here. And  I would do it again in a heartbeat.
