<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on survivor...  Let's get some firewood going here. <br/>Probst: ...at Raro...  We have to get it together today. <br/>Probst: ...Jonathan's direction turns some people off. <br/>Don't be coming around barking orders at me in the morning. It's like "Shut up, fool."  Probst: Drop your buffs. You are merging. Raro and Aitu became one. <br/>Thank you, sir. <br/>Probst: There is a large native catamaran filled with food. ( laughter ) Though the merged tribe celebrated, the outnumbered Aitu four  felt vulnerable. <br/>Our backs are against the wall. We need someone to flip. So I think I know what would change the game. <br/>Probst: Yul formulated a plan...  I have the idol. <br/>Probst: ...to use the hidden immunity idol as leverage. <br/>I think I can use it to get Jonathan. If it works out, it could change the course of the game. Hypothetically, say I have the idol...  I'd have to think long and hard about my reaction if you even implied that  you could show me the idol. <br/>Probst: At the first individual immunity challenge... We are down to the  final two. ...Candice and Ozzy battled it out. But in the end... Candice drops out. Ozzy wins the first individual immunity. You are safe in tonight's vote. After the challenge...  This is the idol. <br/>Probst: ...Yul tried to seal the deal with Jonathan...  I appreciate you showing that to me. Basically, Yul said, "Vote with us, or you're going home tonight."  Probst: ...while Candice and Adam were playing their own game. With tribal council looming...  Please understand I have to think about this. <br/>Probst: ...Jonathan was the swing vote that would make all the difference. <br/>Either way, people are going to be pissed. Either I'll have betrayed the Raro people and I'm a complete bastard, or I  didn't jump over to the Aitu people and I'm a complete bastard. <br/>Probst: But at tribal council, when it came time for his decision... 12th  person voted out and the fourth member of our jury... ...Jonathan betrayed  his former Raro tribe and joined the Aitu four in voting out Nate. Nate, the tribe has spoken. Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>All I can tell you is this. You ready? If it wasn't going to be me tonight, it was going to be you. <br/>He was going to play the idol tonight. You know? I was not going to play that game, because the next time, the four of them  are gunning for me, and I'm in a tie-breaker situation. So I either had a 100% chance of going home tonight or a 50% change of going  home the next time. Because I wanted to swing the vote, flip the game, I vote for Nate. And the truth is that I would rather play with the Aitu people; I'd rather  see them win, if I don't win. I was in the position to make that choice, and I did, and I believe I made  the right choice. <br/>So at tribal council, I think everyone was holding their breath. I believed Jonathan, and I believed he was sincere in switching over, but I  wasn't sure. <br/>It was a huge risk that we took. But this is how I wanted to play the idol. I wanted to play it at a point in time where it, you know, resets the entire  game in your favor, and it worked. <br/>You pissed everyone in this game off, so I hope you're happy with second  place. I just think that you played yourself out tonight, and I am so disappointed. It's vile to me. It makes me... I feel sick to my stomach. After tribal, I just felt like that nausea, and I... really, all I wanted to  do was take Jonathan's face and just throw up all over it. You weren't going home tonight. <br/>I could have been going home tonight. <br/>No, you couldn't have. <br/>If I didn't throw in with them, they all would have vote for me. You all would have voted for Yul, and it would have bounced off Yul and hit  me. <br/>Not if you told us about the idol. <br/>Yul doesn't have the idol. <br/>Yul does have the idol. He showed me the idol. I don't know what you think you're talking about. And even my saying that, you wouldn't trust that I was telling the truth. <br/>I don't. I absolutely don't trust a word that comes out of your mouth. <br/>Fair enough. <br/>I couldn't control myself. I snapped on him and told him how I felt about him and called him out. And I think that he's a filthy, miserable rat. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION ( theme song playing  )  It kind of grosses me out, but I'm going to watch. <br/>You reach inside, and you just pull out...  Ew! <br/>I'm guessing this is day 28. Parvati had never gutted a fish or even seen how to gut a fish in 28 days out  here. Now, I don't know how that's possible. <br/>What is that thing? <br/>Oh, and you guys eat that. Candice eats it. <br/>She's a lazy, selfish girl, and a million dollars to her would not help her  in her life. It would screw her life up. She's been here 27 days, and she never gutted a fish, never even saw how to  gut a fish? <br/>I was teaching her how to gut a fish. <br/>You didn't see me showing her? <br/>And she's was like, "Ew."  This game is not as fun in this position. <br/>I know. <br/>Gross. He makes me want to throw up. <br/>It's a social game. I love playing with you guys. I love hanging out with you. We all worked well, together. Do you know what I mean? We had it down. I come over here, and I see that I'm in the clown house. <br/>Probst: Come on in. Have a seat. Nice, hot, muggy day, perfect for a Survivor auction. ( cheering )  Probst: You each have $500. Bidding is in increments of $20. Borrowing money is okay. Sharing food is not. <br/>Oh. <br/>Probst: Auction will end without warning. Ready to get started? <br/>Yup! <br/>Probst: First item...  $20. <br/>Probst: $20 to Jonathan. <br/>Oh, we don't know what it is. <br/>Probst: No, you don't. <br/>60. <br/>80. <br/>100. <br/>Probst: $100 to Jonathan. Going once, twice, sold to Jonathan. Come on up. Right in here is a slot. Thank you, sir. You want to see what you bought? <br/>I certainly do. <br/>Probst: Hot dog, fries, and to go along with it, cold beer. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, snap. <br/>Probst: Take it. Sit on down. <br/>Oh, it smells good. <br/>Oh! <br/>Party foul. <br/>Spill it on me! <br/>Probst: Next item a little Different. Next item...  Oh, a bath tub. <br/>Probst: The next item is a hot bubble bath. <br/>You sit right here and take a bath? <br/>And while you're taking your bath, you will enjoy a huge piece of chocolate  cake! <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, my god, no! <br/>I'm in it. I'm in this game. <br/>Probst: Start the bidding. <br/>20 bucks. <br/>100 bucks. <br/>160. <br/>Adam! Wait a minute! <br/>I stink. <br/>200. <br/>220. <br/>240. <br/>300. <br/>Probst: Jonathan! Out of nowhere, the guy nobody wants to see take a bath now leading the  auction at 300. <br/>320. <br/>340. <br/>Probst: The question is does Jonathan really want it, or does Jonathan want  you to spend all your money? <br/>360. <br/>Probst: 360 going once, going twice, sold for $360 to Parvati. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>360, take your cake. The bath is yours. <br/>Wow, that's huge! <br/>Oh! <br/>She's in her element, you see. She's happy. <br/>I love this day. It's my favorite day. <br/>Let's keep this thing going. I'm hungry. <br/>Probst: Next item, this will give you power in this game. That's the only clue I'm going to give you. <br/>100. <br/>200. <br/>400. <br/>Probst: 400 to Jonathan. <br/>500. <br/>Probst: Candice bids everything she has. <br/>Becky, I'll lend you money. <br/>600. <br/>Becky, out of nowhere, borrowing money. She's at 600. <br/>Why do you need that, Becky? Y'all have the numbers. <br/>Probst: Candice now looking to Adam for a loan. <br/>620. <br/>Probst: 620 to Candice. <br/>640. <br/>Probst: 640. Going once, going twice... Adam and Candice shake their heads. They don't want anymore. Sold to Becky, $640. It's all there? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Open the note and read it here. <br/>"You must send one person to Exile Island immediately and take the rest  of their money for yourself."  Oh! <br/>Yeah, whoo! <br/>Probst: Who's it going to be, Becky? Who's going to go to Exile Island, leaving right now? The rest of their money goes to you. <br/>They both have $500. <br/>Candice. <br/>Probst: For the fourth time, Candice going to Exile Island. What are you thinking right now, Candice? <br/>Just some food. <br/>Probst: Now, it is day 29. There is still the idea of the hidden immunity idol out on Exile. <br/>I think I know where it is. <br/>I can end the suspense. I have it. <br/>Probst: You have the idol. <br/>I have the idol. <br/>Probst: Did you bring it with you? <br/>Uh, yeah, it's in my bag. <br/>Probst: You want to show it to us now? <br/>Sure. <br/>Probst: You want everybody to know, we might as well just make sure. <br/>Wow. <br/>This is it right here. It's a compass on the necklace. <br/>Looks authentic. <br/>Probst: Yul, why did you want everyone to know something that's so valuable? <br/>I wanted to play it at a critical moment in a game. That opportunity came up, when we were down in the merge. We came in with lower numbers-- four, five. We had to make someone switch, so at that point, I felt like "This is  the right moment. If I play this right, it could change the entire ending of this whole  adventure." And fortunately, it did. <br/>Probst: All right, Candice, you've given your money to Becky. Follow the path. The boat will pick you up. You will return in time for the next immunity challenge. <br/>Probst: Ready for your next item? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Something else a little unusual, a never-ending ice cream maker. <br/>Holy...  Whoa! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Probst: For as long as we are at the challenge, you can eat ice cream. <br/>400. <br/>Probst: 400, Jonathan, everyone penny he's got. <br/>420. <br/>Probst: 420, the magic number, going once, twice, sold to dolphin boy. ( laughter )  Don't waste time! Don't be funny! Eat, eat! Yeah, don't mess around. <br/>Probst: Next item will remain covered. <br/>160. <br/>180. <br/>200. <br/>240. <br/>Probst: 240 to Jonathan. Going once, going twice, sold to Jonathan. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, it's what I like too. It's got pepperoni on it. Pepperoni pizza. Oh, my favorite! And no sharing, right? Oh, my god. <br/>Probst: Next item up for bid, also covered. <br/>60. <br/>80. <br/>100. <br/>120. <br/>140. <br/>Probst: 140 to Sundra. Going once, twice, sold to Sundra, $140. Something straight from your beach, a sea cucumber. A little something to clean up after eating. <br/>100. <br/>Probst: And nobody interested. <br/>Probst: Do you have $100? <br/>I just bid it. <br/>Probst: Sold to Jonathan for 100 bucks. <br/>Here's 100. Here's a tip for you. <br/>Probst: Thanks. <br/>Oh, man, if this is the end of the challenge, I'm going to jump off a bridge. <br/>Probst: That's it. Survivor auction is over. <br/>Jonathan cleaned up on that one. <br/>I got a hot dog and French fries. I got a pizza. <br/>The hard part was just watching other people eat while you couldn't eat. <br/>Of course. <br/>That is painful, surprisingly painful. I didn't think it would bother me, but it was actually very, very difficult. <br/>I got to say, I'm much thirstier having ate that. I don't know if it's the amount of food or just the kind of food. I wouldn't eat that much food in the real world. ( burps )  Oh, I definitely smell that pepperoni-- whew. <br/>Does this make you guys want to reconsider the order? ( Sundra sighing )  I was just like, "Hmm, maybe there's a little... a little resentment, a  little hostility brewing."  We just figured, like, today's show was very...  Revealing. <br/>...very revealing. I think that we were all surprised. <br/>And if he gets in the final four, I will shoot myself. Potentially, this game could get flipped on top of its head once more-- I'm  hoping, I'm praying. It all hangs on other people right now. So the best I can do is try to be as persuasive as I can and try not to be  pushy. <br/>I'm going to get octopus. <br/>Okay. <br/>It's something that they've seen. It's like just seeing the wrong person get ahead. I think Jonathan was a little too arrogant and a little too cocky at the food  auction. And it just shows a little bit maybe of what his true character is like. <br/>After today and just... I feel like his true personality is coming out. <br/>I agree. <br/>And actually spending the last few days with him also is not something I find  particularly pleasant. <br/>Is he coming? <br/>So we were just talking about... talking with Sundra about the whole order of  voting people out. <br/>Cool. Something is up. Unfortunately, I think Parvati and Adam have obviously gotten in the girls'  ear, and I just don't know to what degree that has really worked. Clearly, the energy has shifted. <br/>Fourth time coming out to Exile. It's tough to keep coming out here over and over and over again. I really miss Adam, and it'd be really nice, you know, just to get a hug. I think I'm next on the chopping block, and so I need this immunity. ( thunder ) I wish I wasn't feeling so down right now. Emotionally, I'm on the edge. <br/>"When were we rolled in a barrel? We merged how many days ago? All these key moments remembered now become crucial to know. Your past will affect your future. Stay calm, but you better hurry. Take too long or things don't add up, you might be the next on the  jury."  This challenge is very important for me personally. I don't like what Jonathan stands for. I don't like having Jonathan around. He's just a dirty, dirty rat, and I would love to get some revenge against  Jonathan and continue to be in this game. So I need to win this one. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Now bring in Candice, returning from Exile Island. Shall we get to today's challenge? <br/>Sure. <br/>Probst: First things first. Ozzy, why don't you take that off? Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will be quizzed on how well you recollect the  events of the last 30 days. On my go, you will read four questions. This will give you answers in the form of numbers. You will then add, subtract, or divide the answers to come up with a final  number. You'll then untie a corresponding box, searching for a key. You'll use that key to open a lock, which will raise a flag. The first three to raise their flag move on to the final round. The winner of that round wins immunity, guaranteed a one-in[1]seven  shot at a million bucks. Losers, tribal council, somebody going home. Big enough stakes? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right, take your spots on the start, we'll get going. Here we go. First three move on to the final round. Survivors ready? Go. First question, the total number of pieces used to construct the stepping  stones for the fifth immunity challenge used to transport tribe members from  one platform to the next. Take that number and add it with the number of plaster boxes to be smashed by  each tribe with a club to retrieve keys in the challenge to win the catalog  reward. Take those two numbers, subtract the number of days since the Aitutaki Tribe  mutiny, including today, and subtract the number of people currently in the  jury, and you have your number. How well do you recall what has happened out here over the last month? Jonathan untying, thinks he has it. Ozzy untying. Yul now untying, thinks he has it. If you find a piece of metal that is not a key, you are wrong. Jonathan was wrong, has to start again. Is Ozzy right? No. It's been a long 30 days, hard to remember everything that's happened out  here. Parvati, the first one to get it right. Parvati moving on to the final. Two more people moving on to the final. Candice close. Does she have a key? Who's it going to be? Adam has a key. Jonathan has a key. Candice has a key. Jonathan is good. Adam is good. Candice, just a second too late. Jonathan, Adam, Parvati moving on to the next round. For this round, you will answer more questions. You'll use the key to unlock a timber tunnel, crawl through the tunnel, over  a series of floating pontoons, and raise one final flag. Winner gets immunity. Survivors ready? Go. Here are the next questions: the number of immunity challenges so far,  including this one, plus the number of survivors at tribal council during the  lamb shank feast, divided by the number of underwater flags collected in the  barrel rolling competition. Get that right, you have the number, you get the key, you win immunity. Adam, the first to start untying. Parvati, Jonathan, nowhere close at this point. Adam is right, he has a big lead. And if he's wrong, he'll have to start over. Parvati now untying. Jonathan taking his time, wanting to be right. Adam already searching for that key. Is he right? Adam has the key. He's moving on. Jonathan untying. Parvati still trying to stay in this. Adam ripping through the knots. Adam starts through the tunnel. Jonathan does not have it right. He's got to do his math again. Adam up and over. Parvati has the key. Adam untying the last knots of the timber tunnel. Jonathan, still no key. Parvati has to untie her knots. Adam, through the tunnel. One leg left, the floating pontoons. Can he make it in one go? He's hanging on. <br/>You got it. <br/>Probst: Struggling to hang on. Trying to crawl. And he's doing it. <br/>Come on! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Adam first to cross, casually raises his flag. ( applause ) Adam wins immunity! <br/>Nice job, Adam. <br/>Nice job! <br/>Very good job. <br/>Probst: Adam, come on over. Congratulations. ( applause ) Adam, safe from the vote tonight. But here is a fact: one of you guys is going home tonight. See you at tribal. Grab your stuff, head on back to camp. <br/>Take a little one, and you pop it. <br/>Welcome back. <br/>Thank you. Adam won immunity today at the challenge, so tonight we're going to tribal  council, and it's looking like my number's up. It's upsetting to think that Jonathan will get farther than me in this game,  and that's upsetting to think that someone that everyone feels-- everyone,  even the people in his alliance feel that Jonathan is a snake. <br/>Jonathan's just a slime ball, and he needs to be voted off. <br/>I mean, I understand why you don't like Jonathan, but how does this help you? <br/>I don't care. <br/>It doesn't help us...  I'll be at peace with myself if he's voted out before us. <br/>Honestly, I will feel like I have won if he is voted out before I am. <br/>You're an upstanding guy. <br/>He's behind you, Yul. <br/>Got a flounder. <br/>Yeah, my first flounder. <br/>Nice. <br/>If we can get a fire going, we can cook some fish. <br/>Adam, Parvati, and Candice approached me today. They really want Jonathan out of the game, so they asked me, kind of  appealing to my sense of, you know, justice and integrity, to please vote him  off first. Jonathan is not my first choice to kind of welcome him back. Like, he's... you know, he is what he is. <br/>I think you're underestimating him. <br/>Let me finish. I understand how he thinks, right? The guy is selfish, and he's rational, right? So I can predict, basically, what he's going to go for. I can predict, like, what makes sense to him. <br/>I'm not the ring leader. I mean...  Yeah, you are. <br/>Let me just... it's not that simple. If we change things up right now, it will have other ramifications, and you  know, obviously, I can't really talk about that stuff. <br/>Adam was eating that. Are you taking that away? <br/>Oh, I'm sorry. <br/>Yeah, what are you doing? <br/>I didn't realize it was your coconut. No, no, you eat it. <br/>No, I don't want it! You eat it! <br/>Then what's the problem? All I did was pick it up so I could share it, that's all. <br/>Well, cut it up, eat it. <br/>Great, thank you. <br/>It's not that complicated. <br/>I'll go get some more firewood so we can make some fish. Things finally came to a head. They've been percolating and brewing, a lot of silence, a lot of glares, and  I'm getting a little mad. ( laughter )  You did not miss me. You have not been cuddly. <br/>I missed you. <br/>And you know what? You missed your last night to cuddle. You missed your last cuddly chance. <br/>I'm uncomfortable! <br/>Okay, come here, we'll give you a smooch too. <br/>Jonathan, thank you for the fish. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Thank you, Jonathan. <br/>You're so welcome, guys, of course. I wish it could be more. <br/>Where'd they all go? Are they eating? <br/>Yeah, probably. <br/>That is wrong. That's coming out at tribal. All right, I'll be back. ( thunder )  What's going on, guys? <br/>Well, what do you mean? <br/>I mean, since when do you guys not share food? This is so arrogant and so rude. I can't believe this. <br/>Didn't you call me a... well, it doesn't matter. <br/>Didn't I call you a what? <br/>I was told that I was a disgusting rat and that I should be voted against  tonight for whatever reason. <br/>Well, Jonathan, you're a rat because you betrayed everybody in this game. <br/>Okay, well... and yet... and yet...  Everybody knows that you only care about yourself. Yul said it this afternoon that he can predict your behavior because you're  selfish...  Self-interested. <br/>...and that you're... so he knows what you're going to do. He knows what move you're going to make because you make the selfish decision. <br/>Candice...  And so everybody knows that, and everybody...  Candice, don't speak for me. I can speak for myself, all right? <br/>Then what did you say? <br/>This is not...  What did you say? <br/>This is not how I would...  What did you say? <br/>Look, I said he was a self[1]interested,  rational player, right? To that extent...  You said he's selfish. <br/>...I have certainty as to how he's going to predict... that I can predict his  behavior, because I know what's going to like...  And you don't like Jonathan, and you said that too. And all these people have said that, that they don't like you. <br/>Let's talk about this meal. We all came home from that...  Everybody has their days where they lay down in the tent. <br/>You know what? That's bollocks, and you know it. The rest of us do not choose our days to go lay down in the tent. I work my ass off every single day. <br/>Yeah, because you're trying to weasel your way in somehow. <br/>But luckily you're not name calling, I appreciate that. <br/>I'm not. I'm saying you're trying to weasel your way in. <br/>How dare you...  "Weasel" is a verb in this situation. <br/>How dare you imply...  Weasel your way in. <br/>Excuse me. How dare you imply that I'm behaving differently today than I have for the  last 30 days. You cannot say that that's true. It's not true. <br/>You know...  You know what? And I don't even want to talk about it. You've said more than enough for me. Thank you. <br/>Oh, that's what you're worried about, thinking they're going to be mad at you  for not changing your vote? <br/>Do it again. <br/>But I guess my question to you is there's three of them. Are you going to wait until each one gets voted off to then vote off Jonathan. They're basically all saying the same thing. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury: Brad, Rebecca, Jenny, and  Nate, voted out at the last tribal council. I'll remind you, the jury is here merely to observe. They're gathering information for a million-dollar decision. Let's start with the auction. Becky, the turning point was when you sent Candice to Exile Island for the  fourth time. Why Candice? <br/>I think just seeing her strength and her endurance, she was probably the  fiercest competitor. She was the obvious choice. <br/>Probst: Candice, you return from Exile Island, yet you still come back with a  smile on your face. <br/>I'm out here because I love this game, and it's been rough, you know? There have been some low points. But like Adam always asks everybody, "Are you still smiling?" And  you know, I think you have to keep that spirit up or else, you know, you'll  collapse. <br/>Probst: Ozzy, what happened when you got back to camp after the challenge? <br/>I spent a good amount of time looking for firewood and trying to get the fire  going. Jonathan went out fishing. Candice, Parvati, and Adam just went into the tent basically and later on  caused a huge ordeal with us five eating fish and them three not eating the  fish. <br/>Not sharing the fish. <br/>Probst: You say not eating the fish. You say not sharing the fish. <br/>Inviting us to dinner, basically. <br/>Probst: All right, Parvati, tell me your story. What happened? <br/>Basically, the three of us, me, Candice, and Adam, know we're on the outside. So they have their five, and we have our three. And we're in the tent, you know, just spending time with each other, you know. Apparently it pissed some people off that we weren't helping around camp. So Jonathan gets back and decides that he doesn't want to share his fish that  he's caught. <br/>Everybody but Jonathan, I think, was cool with us working together. I think... I mean, haven't talked to Jonathan, so I don't know what his  thoughts are. <br/>Probst: Are you and Jonathan not speaking to each other? <br/>I don't really care for Jonathan at this point. <br/>It's just interesting the more comfortable he gets with his position in this  game, the more his true colors show, and it just shows the level of  immaturity. I'm sorry, but I'm half his age, and I'm twice as mature as he is. <br/>I agree. <br/>Now it's all starting to come out. I understand that you guys are hurt or disappointed or whatever. But you have five people working, and you have three people who don't do any  work. At what point does the five people who are working and the three people who  are basically waiting for the dinner bell so that they can get fed-- you  know, when is that not appropriate? <br/>I think it's an arrogance thing. "We got the numbers. You're going down. You're on a sinking ship. You know, we got the food. We don't have to feed you." And you know, all of them have said that  they don't like Jonathan. <br/>Everyone knows how you are. It's not a secret. <br/>What am I? <br/>You're a rat! I mean...  That's a fact, that I'm a rat? I don't even know what that means. <br/>You're just...  I'm a cancer. I know. That's enough out of you. <br/>Is that right? There's absolutely no reason for you to be around now though. <br/>Says you, jack-- says you. I've earned my place here today. <br/>Jonathan, you have. You have outwitted your place...  Oh, come on. <br/>...to be here today. <br/>You're just tired of hearing the truth, man. The truth hurts, doesn't it? <br/>That I'm a rat and a cancer? <br/>Come on. <br/>That's the truth? <br/>You are. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Well, just sitting here, it seems to me that rather than a tribe of  five and a tribe of three, there's a tribe of three, with Adam, Candice and  Parvati, a foursome with Ozzy, Sundra, Becky, and Yul, and there's Jonathan  on the other. <br/>I would disagree. <br/>Probst: Well, you're the UN. I'm expecting the UN to come in here and make everything nice. ( laughter )  Look, I mean, obviously when we tell them things, right, we're going to do it  in a way that's going to serve our own interest. So, you know, I wouldn't take them at their word. The way they're painting the picture is not accurate. I'll leave it at that. <br/>He's the puppet master, and we're all puppets in his little play. <br/>Come on, what do you expect me to do? Look, we're all here trying to win. You can't fault me for that. <br/>I do not at all. I respect completely all four of you. <br/>And I'd have a lot more respect, and so would the people on the jury, if they  cut loose of their cancer that they have hooked on them. <br/>Even if all three of us were next to go. <br/>Yeah, one, two, three after that. <br/>Boom, boom, boom, sitting ducks. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Jonathan, a lot has been said tonight. You have been the hub of 90% of it. How are you feeling right now? <br/>I feel fine. I mean, you know, one never wants to hear some of the names that I've been  called, you know. So what am I going to do? Move on with the game. Luckily for me right now, I'm in a better position than I was when I was with  them. <br/>Probst: Candice, what are you basing your vote on? What can you guys do to try and turn this? <br/>Jeff, we've tried everything, but they're going to vote how they're going to  vote, and maybe they're going to vote with us, and maybe they're not. I just wanted to say that this is a decision that the jury is going to make. They need to know what's really going on around camp, because it's been kind  of ugly. <br/>Probst: Okay, let's get to the vote. Adam, you have the immunity necklace. Do you want to give it up? <br/>I'm keeping it. <br/>Probst: You cannot vote for Adam. There is also the hidden immunity idol. You all know that Yul found it, but he could have given it to someone else. Whoever is in possession of the idol, if you need to play it tonight, you  would present it to me after the vote. The person with the next highest number of votes would be sent home. It is time to vote. Ozzy, you're up. <br/>I'm not going to sacrifice myself for you, and tonight, you showed me your  true colors. <br/>Wow, piece of work. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Jonathan. Candice. One vote Jonathan, one vote Candice. Jonathan. Two votes Jonathan, one vote Candice. Candice. Two votes Candice, two votes Jonathan. Jonathan. That's three votes Jonathan, two votes Candice. Candice. We're tied, three votes Jonathan, three votes Candice. Candice. That's four votes Candice, three votes Jonathan. 13th person vote out and the fifth member of our jury, Candice. That's five, that's enough. Unless you have the hidden immunity idol, you need to bring me your torch. Well, the kiss is nice. Maybe if it were love, he'd have given you the immunity necklace. Candice, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Still smiling, guys. Have fun. Love ya. <br/>Probst: Time for you to go. Well, I think tonight's tribal council speaks for itself. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

Ah! I feel like my finger's about to fall off. <br/>That could be bad. I mean, I don't know if you can stay out here with that. <br/>Probst: And Yul feels the pressure. <br/>They're going to say anything they can, because if you fall for it, then I'm  gone; they're still around, waiting to take you guys out. <br/>I feel like I'm kind of like the godfather or something, arranging a hit on  somebody. <br/>Wow, what can I say? What a fabulous time I've had out here playing this game. I think I can look myself in the mirror and be comfortable with the way I  played this game, definitely. That little kiss with Adam, it was a nice way to leave. We were partners through this, and it was sincere.
