<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor...  To our new tribe. <br/>Probst: After the two tribes merged, the old Galu had a comfortable  eight-four advantage over the old Foa Foa. <br/>The plan for Foa Foa is to shoot them down-- pop, pop, pop, pop. <br/>Probst: But while the old Galu was basking in the glow of victory...  No. <br/>Probst: ...they were blind to the fact that Shambo felt ostracized by Laura  and embraced by Russell. <br/>Shambo hates Laura, so I know at any point, she'll vote Laura's name. <br/>Probst: They also didn't realize that Natalie was working the Galu women to  take out a Galu man. <br/>I don't trust Erik. <br/>All of a sudden, all the girls want to vote Erik out, but they could possibly  be saying, "Let's say vote Erik," and then they get me and the idol. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, both Russell and Erik showed up with hidden  immunity idols. Erik's idol stayed in his pocket because he was sure that he wasn't in danger. <br/>I would be floored if I saw them get one Galu member to turn. <br/>Probst: Russell was sure that he wa in danger, so he played his idol. Any votes cast for Russell tonight will not count. But he didn't need to because Natalie's plan worked. Seventh person voted out of Survivor: Samoa and the first member of our  jury-- Erik. Thanks to Natalie, the old Galu blindsided one of their own. The tribe has spoken. Although the Foa Foa four have lived to see another day, their battle is far  from over. 11 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? (crickets chirping)  I'd just like a chocolate chip cookie...  Uh-huh. <br/>...with, like, one-inch thick of peanut butter on it. <br/>Ooh. <br/>Thanks, Shambo. <br/>At Tribal today, I had a strong feeling it would be me. Uh, I didn't even think twice about playing the idol. But I'm really worried, because I'm pretty sure I'm out next. I'm gone. <br/>So, I'm hoping for a miracle, because I'm in deep trouble right now. <br/>That was perfect. <br/>Yeah. <br/>That could not have been better, girls. <br/>Well, because...  Well, no, because...  I wanted... We needed to make him nervous. I think it was the dumbest move that Russell could have made, playing that  idol tonight. When he stood up and he used it, I about came off my stool. It could not have happened any better for us, because not only did we get rid  of Erik, we just flushed out that idol and then exposed who's going to be  coming up next. It could not have happened any better. Russell should absolutely be nervous. Russell is going to be gone next. * (squeaking)  I have no idea how to do this. Well, I kind of went out for a walk, and I stumble upon this rat or this  mouse. I'm so scared. Oh, my gosh! A rock or a stick? A rock or a stick? I really ca... Oh, my gosh! I'm, like, oh, my goodness, that's, like, something to eat. I was just thinking, I'm starving. I never thought I'd be this hungry in my life. Oh, gosh. Okay, just turn around, eat your... eat your snack. Eat your snack. Eat your snack. Eat your snack, buddy. Oh, gosh. Oh, my word. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is pitiful. Oh, my gosh. Oh, Lord, have mercy. Oh, my word. Okay. Finally, I just hit the rat. It was really hard for me 'cause he was looking at me. He was cute, but I knew how... I'm starving. I've never been this hungry in my entire life. I feel like I'm just fading away. Um, I have something to show y'all. <br/>What do you got? <br/>Yeah? <br/>I killed something, y'all. <br/>What'd you kill? <br/>A rat. <br/>What...? <br/>I swear, y'all, I swear. It's right here. <br/>What? Ew! <br/>I know, it's disgusting. Would you have done it? <br/>How did you kill a rat? <br/>With a stick. It was scary. I didn't know what I was doing. Russell! <br/>What? <br/>Natalie walks into camp with this rat in a coconut, and we're all just  shocked. <br/>Did you catch that? <br/>Get it? Got it? <br/>Well, I killed it. I hit it with a stick and then the rock. I just don't know...  Are you serious? <br/>Yeah. <br/>She came into this game the Southern belle, you know, very sweet, nice girl,  but definitely not the rough-and-tumble Survivor type. She wasn't a Shambo. So when she came back in her little bikini with a rat in the coconut, we were  all shocked to death. <br/>Beef jerky. <br/>Oh, that's so good. <br/>It kind of just tastes like chicken. <br/>On so many levels, I'm proud of Natalie out here. You know, from what I knew about her coming in to where she is now, I think  she's changed a lot over the last 23 days, and I'm really happy for her. <br/>You're a rock star hunter and gatherer. <br/>Oh, thanks! <br/>You believe, girl. <br/>Oh, we got a little tree mail. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Isn't that nice? <br/>What else is in here? Nothing. (laughter)  I found the other idol, everybody. <br/>Yeah. If there's another immunity idol that gets put into play, I'm going to find  it, because I'm probably gone next time. So I have to believe there's one here. <br/>Tree mail! <br/>Tree mail! <br/>"And now for something completely different. A challenge with a digital display! You'll work together with a bunch of nuts, to win a feast and a  getaway!"  Oh! <br/>The second immunity idol-- I think it's in the camp right now, and I think  I'm going to find it today. But we've got a reward challenge coming up, so right now, I don't have time,  but I'm working on it. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, absolutely. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, you will divide into two teams of five. On my go, you will race two at a time out into a field to collect a series of  poles threaded with white and black coconuts. Once you've retrieved the poles, arrange them so that the white coconuts form  a four-digit number. Each team's number is different, so you're not going to be able to cheat. Once you have the number, I'll blindfold a tribe member. Using only their sense of touch, they must find the same number on a  combination lock. The first team to solve their combination lock and raise their flag wins  reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: The winning team will be taken directly from here to a one-of-a-kind  massive rock slide. This is a natural rock slide that you literally slide down the rocks into  beautiful fresh water. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: You'll also enjoy a nice picnic lunch. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: Fried chicken. <br/>Oh. <br/>Probst: Chocolate brownies. <br/>Oh...  Oh, no! <br/>Chocolate. <br/>Probst: Worth playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Okay, we're going to have a random draw for our teams, and because  there are 11 of you, that means one person will not participate in this  challenge. All right, we've chosen our teams. Jaison, Laura, Brett, Mick and Russell-- that's our yellow team. Shambo, Kelly, Dave, John and Monica are the purple team. That leaves you, Natalie, as the odd one out. Here's the twist for you. You will not participate in the challenge. What you're going to do instead is choose one team to support. If you choose the team that goes on to win, you go on reward with them. If you choose the team that ends up losing, you go back with them to camp  empty-handed. Big decision. Look at the two teams. Who do you think has the best shot of winning? <br/>They look like a pretty good... a pretty good match. I guess I will go with Brett, Laura, Mick, Russ and Jaison. <br/>Probst: Natalie, going to support the yellow team. Natalie, you'll take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize, we'll get started. All right, you're going out two at a time. Survivors ready? Go! Mick and Brett, John and Kelly. <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>Let's go, guys! <br/>Probst: Got to get those knot untied! <br/>Got it. Got it. <br/>Probst: Kelly and John heading back with the first pole for purple. Mick and Brett heading back with the first pole for yellow. Go! <br/>Hey, guys. <br/>Probst: Dave and Shambo heading out for purple. Russell and Jaison now heading out for yellow. <br/>Let's go, Jaison and Russell! <br/>Got it? <br/>I-I got it. <br/>Come on. <br/>Probst: Jaison and Russell quickly heading back. Dave and Shambo heading back. Go, yellow! <br/>Go, go, go, go! <br/>Probst: Brett and Mick out on the course for yellow. Yellow's now in the lead. <br/>Go! <br/>Probst: Kelly and John back out on the course for purple. Mick and Brett rip through those knots. John and Kelly making fast work of it, trying to make up some time. <br/>Move! Move! Move! Move! <br/>Come on, guys! Come on! <br/>Probst: John and Kelly closing the gap. We are neck and neck! <br/>Yeah, come on. <br/>Probst: Russell and Jaison back out on the course. They are going for their last pole. Dave and Shambo. Shambo really slowing purple down. <br/>Come on, Sham! Come on, Sham! <br/>Probst: That gives yellow a lot of advantage. <br/>Let's go Jaison, Russell! You guys got it. <br/>Probst: Jaison and Russell heading back with that final pole. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Let's go guys! <br/>Probst: They've all made quick work of the knots for purple. Yellow still in the lead. <br/>Got it! Got it! Push it! <br/>Run, Shambo, run! <br/>Probst: Dave and Shambo heading back with that final pole for purple. Start working on it, yellow. <br/>Good job, guys. Let's go yellow. Study it good. <br/>Let's go! Let's go! <br/>Probst: Go, purple. <br/>Put them up, put them up. Dave and Shambo, put them up. <br/>Probst: You are now looking to form a four-digit number using the white  coconuts. <br/>Put this one at the very top. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>We both take this one, we have a three. <br/>Just grab it. <br/>Good job, guys, come on, guys. Hustle, stick with it, you can do it. <br/>Three. <br/>Put this one in the middle. <br/>Come on, champ. <br/>Six. <br/>One. <br/>That's not a three, that's not a three. <br/>This is a four. <br/>It could be a three. <br/>This one-- the top one needs to rotate. Watch out, guys. <br/>That makes it a four. All right. Drop this, Shambo. Shambo, grab this. <br/>Probst: Dave has an idea. Barking out orders now. <br/>Good girl, good girl. That's the girl. <br/>What if we rotate this middle one, that turns this into a six? Let's rotate this one. <br/>Rotate this one? <br/>Okay, this one. <br/>Come on, hustle, hustle, hustle. <br/>That's a three, that's a seven. No. We need a six. We got it, we got it. Four, six, seven, three. Monica! <br/>Yes! <br/>Four, six, seven, three. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Purple has their number, they've passed it on to Monica. Each team's number is different. That means yellow can't cheat off purple. Yellow still looking for those four digits. <br/>You got tons of time, Monica, relax. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Monica now working on the puzzle for purple. She must now find the same four numbers her teammates found below while  blindfolded, using only her fingers. <br/>Please, dear God. <br/>There's a three, there's a four, there's a six. There's a seven. Seven, three, four, six. <br/>Okay, got it. Come on. <br/>Hurry, hurry, tell him. <br/>Seven, three, four, six. <br/>Probst: Laura now working on the puzzle for yellow. <br/>Come on, Moni. <br/>Probst: Monica had a nice head start. Can she keep the lead? <br/>Keep going, Monica. <br/>Probst: Laura not panicking. <br/>Keep working, keep working. <br/>Laura, seven, three, four, six. <br/>Probst: Now it's a matter of who is going to finish first. <br/>No, no, no. <br/>Probst: Monica thinks she has it. <br/>Four, six, seven, three, Moni. <br/>Probst: It is wrong. Keep working. <br/>Keep going. <br/>They're not done. <br/>Seven, three, four, six. <br/>Probst: Monica has it right. Purple wins reward! (cheers and applause)  Right on. Good job, Moni. <br/>You rock, little sister. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Good job. Nice. Nice. <br/>That's a girl. Good girl. <br/>Probst: Natalie, you can join yellow. Natalie, Russell, Mick, Brett, Jaison, Laura, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. <br/>Enjoy. <br/>Thanks, man, good job. You guys were tough. <br/>Probst: Dave, Shambo, Kelly, John, Monica, congratulations. You will leave from here and be taken to a beautiful spot. Grab your stuff, head out. Have a good afternoon. * (John laughs)  Today's reward is awesome. The rock slides are killer. <br/>Careful. How high is that? (Monica screaming) (laughter)  Whoa. <br/>The slides are big and fast and fun. The pools are cool. It's kind of what I've been looking forward to for a while-- just a day of  relaxation. <br/>I'm, like, so terrified of water slides. (Kelly screaming) It was so fun just, like, going down. It's fresh water and it's clean, it's clear, and... (Kelly and Monica  screaming) ...it's just been beautiful here. <br/>Mmm. Cheers. <br/>Cheers. <br/>My family's from Puerto Rico, and it totally reminds me of Puerto Rico and  waterfalls and the rain forest. It reminds me of my family and a lot of the vacations we used to take as kids. These doughnuts are, like, redonkulous. The food is fantastic, and having these waterfalls surround you altogether  makes for an amazing reward. Cheers. <br/>Sweet tea. <br/>And lemon, too. <br/>Okay. "So you've won a reward, You'll have fun and you'll eat. But you didn't come here for food, You came here to compete. Clue #1 The real prize is information, On how to stay safe in this game. Hidden at your camp is an idol, And 'Immunity' is its name."  I say we share the info with all the Galus and we got a, we got a free  trigger to pull. <br/>There is another hidden immunity idol that has been put into play that is  hiding at camp somewhere. So because there's no members of the old Foa Foa here, we're going to keep  that information strictly, you know, Galu right now. <br/>I'm happy just with everyone here. (Dave burps)  Right now I'm starting to feel more and more comfortable with the plan of  sort of knocking off Foa Foa after Foa Foa. <br/>We need to get a Foa Foa gone for sure. Who-- do you think Russell? <br/>Hmm? <br/>Who do you think should go from Foa Foa? <br/>I don't want Russell to go. <br/>I know, but he's super strategic. <br/>He's strategic, but he sucks at challenges. We can beat him. <br/>Shambo-- she's protecting Russell, you know? Russell's one of the most conniving players I feel like we have going in the  game right now. Like, he needs to go. Yeah. <br/>Because Russell didn't even have a clue. <br/>I know. <br/>If I had to pick one person that would, I think, go over to Foa Foa, it would  definitely be Shambo. But whether Shambo's with us or not, we still have six to five if she goes  with them, and we don't really need them. <br/>I don't care about no damn reward. I'm here to win the game. I'm gonna find the next immunity idol and I ain't going to tell a damn soul. You know, I thought maybe it might be around tree mail, it might be around  the water, or it might be around the bridge. It has to be near something-- a landmark, something. It cannot be any other place. That's where it has to be, around them areas. That easy. Think I just found the second hidden immunity idol without a clue. (laughs) This is crazy. This might be worth one million dollars. This is it-- number two. This is amazing. Am I that damn good? (laughs) This is just unprecedented. I missed fried chicken and brownies for the second hidden immunity idol. Sounds like a good exchange to me. <br/>All right, dude. All righty, then. <br/>Yesterday, I found the immunity idol without anybody telling me anything. Well, I think I want to share something with you. Not two in a row, that's just the gift that I have. This was why I was born. I was going to keep it to myself, but we only have four people left from Foa  Foa. So you have to have help with it. I can trust you more than I can trust anybody out here. <br/>As I do you. <br/>So...  Dude, you do... you are... Tell me you...  So you're going to have to... you're going to have to to help me help you. <br/>Dude, dude, her head is getting fricking lopped off. <br/>You're right. We vote Laura. <br/>It's a samurai sword. <br/>This is just going to be a wonderful thing. Shocker. <br/>You lucky bastard! I cannot believe you found both those fricking immunity idols. <br/>The lucky thing helps us both. <br/>Oh, my God! I have been pretty much aligned with Foa Foa for the last two weeks. I really hit it off with those guys, created some really great relationships. Russ is probably the one guy in this game that I impeccably trust. <br/>You're right in the same boat I'm in right now. <br/>That is so funny. <br/>Right now it has no holes. It had holes and it was a sinking ship before, but we patched them up. <br/>Wow! <br/>It's time to sail on. (laughter) You know, I'm going to need help to make sure my name is on the  chopping block. <br/>That's already been put into motion. This is going to be unbelievable. Our plan is let them vote Russell, so when six of them vote Russell, we'll  come back and vote Laura. He'll play the hidden immunity idol and she'll go home. So I am so excited. The only thing that can derail this is her winning immunity. <br/>If Medusa wins immunity, we get rid of one of her posse. Yup. And then she's going to be scrambling. <br/>They have a disdain for Monica-- the boys do-- that will eliminate her  immediately. But nobody's got anything on Kelly, nobody's got anything against Kelly, so  Kelly's a bigger threat than Monica. <br/>Right. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. Guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: First things first, I'll take back the immunity necklaces. <br/>You can borrow it for a little while, Jeff. <br/>Probst: I'm going to be giving it back to you? All right, I like it. Thank you, Laura. Today, only one immunity necklace. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will use a grappling hook to retrieve two bags,  each containing a puzzle peg. The first three to get their bags move on to the final round where you must  place one of those pegs in its appropriate spot on the board. Each time you place a peg, another one drops down. First person to get all their pegs in the right spot wins immunity. Guaranteed a one in ten shot at a million dollars. All right, we'll draw for spots. We'll get started. All right, here we go. First three to get both their bags move on to the final round. Survivors ready? Go! Bit of a learning curve. How much rope to hold onto. Nice toss by Russell. Just misses the bag, but a great toss. Shambo makes a snag. Now she's got to reel it in. Shambo has her first bag. Mick with a good toss. He hooks it. Mick got his first bag. Kelly has her first bag. Brett on target. Brett has his first bag. <br/>Damn it! <br/>Probst: Mick has his second bag. Making quick work of it. Mick moving on. Looking for two more people. Natalie with her first bag, but she loses it. <br/>My hook's stuck. <br/>Probst: Go get it. Jaison with his first bag. Laura with the long toss. Laura has her first bag. Russell just barely hooks a bag. Got his first one. Shambo with a good toss. And she hooks it! <br/>Got it, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Shambo has both bags. Shambo's moving on! One more person moving on. Laura, Kelly, Brett, Jaison, Russell, all looking for that last bag. Russell with a good toss. Can he turn it into a snag? He does. Russell has his second bag! Laura has her second bag! It's a race! Russell loses his! Laura has hers! Laura moving on! Laura, Mick, Shambo moving on to the final round. Here we go. Final round for immunity is Laura, Mick, and Shambo. Survivors ready? Go. Each bag has a peg. One peg will fit in that board, one peg will not fit. You have to choose the right one to start your sequence. Mick has both his pegs. Trying to find a spot. The question is, which is the first peg to fit? Shambo has both her pegs. Once you find that first one, it will start the sequence. Shambo has her first piece. Shambo places another piece. <br/>Yeah, Sham. <br/>Probst: Mick trying to force it. Is it right? Mick has his first piece. <br/>Go, Mick. <br/>Probst: Laura has both her pegs. Shambo with another piece. <br/>Come on, Sham. <br/>Relax, relax. Think, think. <br/>Probst: Mick has another piece. Immunity on the line. A guaranteed one-in-ten shot at a million bucks. Laura has her first piece. Laura has her second piece. Shambo places another one. Laura with her third piece now. Laura places another piece. Laura like clockwork on this, like she's done this before. Laura with another one! <br/>All you got to do is look at, look at the piece. <br/>Probst: Mick studying while Laura continues to place pieces effortlessly. <br/>Total square, total square, total square. <br/>Probst: Laura really running away with the challenge right now. Gonna have to work to catch catch Laura. <br/>Look at the piece. Look at the piece. <br/>Come on. <br/>Arrow left, arrow left, arrow left. <br/>Probst: Laura still talking to herself, and it's working. <br/>Right there. Laura getting very close. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: Laura down to her last piece. Laura wins individual immunity! Safe tonight at Tribal Council. <br/>Good job, girl. <br/>Probst: Laura, come on over. <br/>Good job. <br/>Probst: Back-to-back immunity wins. Laura is safe at tonight's Tribal Council. As for the rest of you, one of you going home tonight. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. Congratulations. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Right now, we're just getting rid of Foa Foa. Clearly, Russell's the first one to go because he's lied to us all. I see the Galu tribe voting for Russell, including Natalie. I think she wants to make good that she's in, so tonight Russell's going home. <br/>Good job, Laura. <br/>Oh, the challenge sucked 'cause Laura won, and now we can't vote her off, and  my heart is broken. I'm so sad. I'm pissed. I think you always have to have a plan B, and I said in the off chance that  she did get immunity today, that we'd vote Kel 'cause Kelly's stronger than  Monica. Monica's no threat whatsoever. So eliminate somebody that's close to Laura, cause a little dissension  amongst the ranks. That's the plan of attack. <br/>I found another immunity idol. <br/>Bull ... Where'd you find it? <br/>At the bridge. <br/>Nicely done, my man. You deserve this, man. You deserve this, for real. <br/>Dude...  Listen...  I know what's happening. Hopefully, they trying to vote me out. So trust me, just vote Kelly. Everything else is fine. <br/>So Russell found another idol that the Galu members don't know about. And, uh, the idea is to surprise them with it. It's a gamble, baby. <br/>It's a gamble. <br/>All right, I'm with you. If Galu gets wind of what's going on, they're gonna change their vote and  they'll take somebody on Foa Foa out that's not Russell, and it's all a waste. So it's gotta to be Russell tonight or we're all through. <br/>There's an immunity idol. So the idea is to focus all the attention on Russell...  He found another one? <br/>He found another. It's under the bridge. Hi. What's going on? <br/>So Russell found the idol. It's unbelievable how he finds these things. And so quickly, too. He just has a keen mind for it, you know? <br/>I'm really beginning to love that guy. I'm really beginning to love him. <br/>He's good at this thing. I didn't know there would be a second one. So I'm excited to see what happens tonight at Tribal Council. We all hope to put a dent in Galu today and put a big dent in that arrogance  and condescending patronizing attitude they have towards us. <br/>So remind me-- Russell, Natalie, Mick, Jaison, right? <br/>Should we plan for just in case that one of them may find an idol? Because if we all vote for Russell, and then say Russell has the idol again,  at that point the other person goes home, and it's one of us. <br/>That... All right, listen. We can't worry about that right now. Now's not the time for that. Like, they don't know anything about it. <br/>I can tell you if it were me and I was on Foa Foa and I were over here...  I'd be looking for the idol. <br/>I would assume that it was here. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I mean, that's not rocket science. <br/>Which means they found it just by digging in tree stumps, though. <br/>He found a fricking idol without a fricking clue. <br/>Here's, here's the thing that... Here's what I, here's all... No, no, no, no. That's what makes me nervous, right? <br/>I don't think he has it. I don't think he even... If he suspects there's one here, I'd be surprised. First vote-- Russ, second vote Natalie, bang... or vice versa. We can go Natalie first, we can go Russ second. <br/>I say Russ first. I say Russ. <br/>I don't know. <br/>I think I heard that they were gonna vote Natalie. I don't know that, but I heard them say her name. That's how this game goes. It messes with your mind. I think they made their mind up; I think it might be Natalie. <br/>You think it's Natalie? Why do you think that? <br/>I don't know. (laughs)  You got few hours to try and sway it to make sure. <br/>I don't know if I should play it or not. I'm confused on what to do. I don't want to be the dumbass that gets voted out with the idol in his  pocket, and I don't want to be the dumbass that uses the idol again, and then  nobody votes my name. So now, I don't know what to do with it. <br/>And as soon as we burn all the Foa Foas, kill a chicken. <br/>Yeah! <br/>It's our Galu chicken, it's not theirs. <br/>Yeah, it's not theirs. <br/>We're making it pure Galu all the way. <br/>I'm not sharing with anybody that ain't purple. <br/>That's right. Right now, I think we're tight. The Galu tribe is tight. We don't trust Sham, but we are still definitely six strong. As long as we can get the Foa Foa out, and then we have seven of the Galu  left, that's what we want. <br/>I like that. I'm there. <br/>Probst: I'll now bring in the first member of our jury. Erik voted out at the last Tribal Council. So, Dave, coming into last Tribal, Galu had the numbers, eight to four. You voted out one of your own in Erik. Is that a sign that old tribal lines are gone and this now is an individual  game? <br/>Not at all, Jeff. To be honest, our tribe was weakened from within by Erik's presence. And it was actually a strengthening of our tribal unity. <br/>Probst: Kelly, how did you feel about last tribal's vote? <br/>I think there was this uneasiness in the tribe, almost like a snake kind of  starting a lot of trouble and it seemed to all come back to Erik. So when it comes down to it, you have to go with who you trust. <br/>Probst: Natalie, what's it like at camp? The old Galu tribe is still in charge, in terms of numbers, and it's their  camp. <br/>I think they're trying to make us still feel welcome, like we're all one. <br/>Probst: How could they possibly make you feel like you're all still one? <br/>You know, I've been welcomed into the shelter, I sleep with them. <br/>Probst: But Natalie, you're not all still one. <br/>You're right. But they're not, like, being mean or ugly to anybody. I guess that's more or less what I was trying to say. But the fact of the matter is, it is seven to four and they are tight. <br/>Probst: Jaison, what does it say to the Foa Foa foursome that Galu was  willing to get rid of one of their own? <br/>They're very tight-lipped about what's going on over there, so it's hard to  figure out if there is a crack or not. You never know what can happen. Maybe there's another Erik out there that hasn't been exposed yet. So I'm just trying to hold on to some hope. <br/>Probst: Shambo, tell me the state of the game right now, from where you sit. <br/>It feels like the original Galu is pretty comfortable, and the Foa Foa is  kind of holding on. <br/>Probst: So, Mick, if old tribal lines are holding strong, your only chance is  to keep chipping away. Otherwise, your days are numbered. <br/>Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we know that, the numbers are obvious. But we still hope somebody will see past the former Galu, former Foa Foa, and  just see four solid votes and be like "I need to make a big move  here."  Probst: Russell, so do you spend most of your day observing the Galu seven,  trying to figure out-- maybe there's a crack here, maybe I can get in over  here? <br/>Well, yeah, I did. But now, you know, it's getting to where we're hoping that somebody comes to  us. Talks to us and wants to do something. But they seem to be pretty tight. <br/>Probst: Monica, do you see Foa Foa people going up to your tribe mates,  trying to see if they can start some drama? <br/>I think the Foa Foa see how strong the seven of us are, at this point. If they are giving it a try, I give them respect for doing so, but I don't  think it's that hard of a try that they're giving. <br/>Probst: So at this point in the game, Dave, how do you decide who's next? <br/>I think you just have to assess who's the most dangerous, and there are  several different criteria, not the least of which is physical ability,  mental toughness, strategic acumen. And it's a communal decision, you know? We try to come to a consensus so that everybody feels heard and everybody  feels that their needs are being met. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. Laura, once again, you have the immunity necklace, keeping it for yourself? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: You can not vote for Laura. Anybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Brett, you're up. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. <br/>I ain't finished playing just yet. Keep hope alive. <br/>Probst: The rules of Survivor state that if someone plays a hidden immunity  idol, then any votes cast against that person will not count and the person  with the next-highest number of votes will be sent home. This is an idol. Any votes cast against Russell will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote-- Russell. Does not count. Russell. Does not count. Russell. That's three votes Russell, none of them count. Russell. Does not count. Russell. Does not count. Russell. Does not count. We still have no votes for anybody. Russell. Does not count. Kelly. <br/>You're kidding me. <br/>Probst: That's one vote Kelly. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: Two votes Kelly. Eighth person voted out of Survivor: Samoa and the second member of our jury,  Kelly. That's three. Tonight, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Wow. <br/>Wow. Probst: Kelly, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Well, since the merge, there have been two Tribal Councils, two blind sides,  two hidden immunity idols played and, once again, the Foa Foa foursome have  survived the vote. The question is, will tonight's vote change the game or merely delay the  inevitable? One more thing: the hidden immunity idol goes back into the game once again. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor, it's a showdown between Russell and Laura. <br/>It's only a matter of time, Russ. <br/>I'm ten times smatter than she could ever be. <br/>Probst: And finding the next idol means everything. <br/>They're moving. <br/>Go get them. Let's follow them. <br/>Come on, Dave. <br/>We need to keep that hidden immunity idol out of Russell's hands. <br/>I definitely, definitely wasn't expecting to be going home tonight. Everything was working out perfectly and I hope Galu gets rid of Russell. It's too many idols. How many can there be. He's just a little sneaky man and I definitely know that he's next on the  line. Foa Foa stepped in and totally I think took us all by surprise. totally shocked.
