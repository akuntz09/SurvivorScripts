<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor:  Water! <br/>Just lick some leaves, man. Probst: Life at Ravu was bleak. <br/>I never experienced dehydration like this. Half of us can't even stand up. It's crazy! We're starving here, bro. <br/>Life at Moto was carefree. <br/>We have a really plush couch. We are very fortunate to be living the way that we're living. <br/>Boo, be careful! <br/>Probst: And Boo got careless. <br/>Boo is a real hazard to hisself, and he will hurt hisself out of the game. <br/>Sylvia. <br/>Is she here? <br/>Probst: Sylvia joined Ravu after a night on Exile Island. <br/>Welcome home! When I went up to greet her, I was actually quite nasty. I look over her shoulder, and I open up her shoulder bag to see if she found  the immunity idol. <br/>Tonight, we ought to go out and get some oysters. <br/>Probst: But her presence brought on new frustrations. <br/>I was not really excited for Sylvia to come back. I personally think she's a little bossy. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge...  I'm pulling out the...  Probst: Erica's certain she's right! Erica spoke up, while Moto pulled ahead. Moto wins the challenge! Moto. Moto took home fishing supplies, and banished Earl, who battled the serpents  on Exile Island. Facing Tribal Council...  Probst: ...Mooky and Rocky turned against Erica...  Now you want Erica, huh? She freaked out. <br/>Probst: ...blaming her for Ravu's loss. <br/>She was screaming, she's on people about peace and this and that, when it  wasn't even her place to be there. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council...  Sylvia is used to dictating and telling people what to do. <br/>Probst: ...Sylvia's personality was scrutinized. <br/>You have a habit of kind of throwing out an idea and saying, "Let's do  it," and not actually talking with anybody. <br/>Probst: But it was Erica whose torch was snuffed. Erica, the tribe has spoken. 17 are left. 17 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>The two back-to-back losses have really affected us, and this last Tribal  Council was very brutal. We came to a realization that we are quite... not quite connected together  yet as a tribe. <br/>First thing in the morning, let's cut some coconuts, get some... get  hydrated, cut some pineapples. <br/>I would like to, if I see big sun, if I could try and start a fire. <br/>Yeah, I'll be out there on the beach with you, too, with some glasses. <br/>Being the biggest group of losers that Survivorhas ever seen sucks! It's no fun. We can't win challenges right now; I don't know what it is. I don't know if they put, like, a jinx on us or a curse, but we just can't  win right now. Let's say we do have a challenge tomorrow, okay? I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just throwing out a suggestion. Maybe... maybe, like, somebody could just-- not even take charge-- just one  person can talk at a time. When everybody talks over each other, it doesn't work. <br/>Right. <br/>At this point, we still have the desire to win, but we really need to get our  act together and have a good strategy going in. <br/>Let's put egos aside and put tribe and winning first, and just, you know,  have... We've got to try. <br/>The more we lose, the more  The more we lose, the more difficult it is to recover. difficult it is to recover. difficult it is to recover. [theme song playing] [theme song playing]  This is going to dry real quick. <br/>Looks nice, huh? <br/>It's pretty. <br/>I like it. <br/>Lisi suggested that we paint the floor to kind of seal up the wood to prevent  the ants from coming in. It will look nice, but there's a function to it. <br/>It looks pretty, but it wasn't done with the intention for aesthetics. I'll bet the ant lines are going to be a lot less tonight. <br/>Hurry, hurry, to the pot. <br/>Very good. <br/>Oh, they're perfect. <br/>This is going too great. <br/>Yeah. It's, like, too good to be true, man. <br/>We gotta take a poll. <br/>Are we really on Survivor, or are we dreaming? <br/>We're just having a party out here, really. We're telling jokes, lounging around on a hammock. We don't have to win anything else as far as survival. It's not even survival. It's "thrive-al."  I really wouldn't be surprised if the people on the other side just started  dropping like flies because they just don't seem to be catching a just don't  seem to be catching a break, man. break, man. <br/>Big Earl! <br/>Ravu! <br/>Welcome home! <br/>You guys got a fire? <br/>No. The sun, we seen it today, man. <br/>But you got some water, sweetie? <br/>I'm back from Exile Island. The first thing they asked me, "Do you have water?" It was like  walking on the beach to a bunch of begging children. <br/>Was the clue really obscure? <br/>The clue is interesting. As far as the immunity idol, I sure have no idea where it is. I mean, I don't know how it really works, with the clue thing, like, I mean,  you guys probably know more than I do. I mean, I have to give more thought, and really survey the land. It's under something that's high, and it can be anywhere, but I'll figure  something out. Losing-- it hurts. Yeah, I mean, come on. It's, like, no fire again? We're trying to take advantage of any of this sun or are we just, like, dead? <br/>Now we're waiting for the point where it gets up high enough. <br/>Dear Sun, Michelle would like you to come out and play today. Please participate in my game. Sincerely, Michelle. <br/>It's coming out. It's going to come out. <br/>Yeah. We haven't had fire, so I decided to just go out and give it a go while we  have some sun. The sun's moving fast, oh, geez. Using glasses to start a fire is absolutely possible. I started to pray, because I know my momma doesn't want me to die out here. Come on. Come on. Burn, baby, burn. Burn, baby, burn. Whoo! I looked down about a minute and a half later, and I see the start of a fire,  so I go running back to the beach. First person I see is Anthony, and I hand that off to him. I'm, like, "Start a fire with this."  Fire! <br/>Fire? <br/>Help. <br/>Oh, here, here, here, here. <br/>I got to go. Where am I going? <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>There you go. <br/>Give me some tinders. <br/>Somebody blow, somebody blow. Gentle, gentle. Anything you got here, get it Anything you got here, get it going, come on. going, come on. going, come on. [cheering] [cheering]  Awesome. [cheering, whooping]  We're not gonna die. <br/>We've been struggling a long time, and now we finally got a shot in the ass  that we needed, so I think it's going to be a good day. I'd be scared to be the other team right now because we're, we're just so  fired up, it's ridiculous. ridiculous. <br/>Probst: Moto, come on in. <br/>Probst: Moto, come on in. Ravu, come on in. Moto, getting your first look at the new Ravu tribe. Erica voted out at the last Erica voted out at the last Tribal Council. Tribal Council. Ravu, last time I talked to you guys, life was not enjoyable. Rocky, things still tough over there? <br/>Uh, things are tough, but, but they're getting better. My, uh, my girl Michelle over here started a fire today... boiled some water;  things are looking up. <br/>Probst: You started fire? <br/>Yes. <br/>Michelle did, yes, we did. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Ravu, I got to say you have done what very few tribes have ever done  in this game, which is start fire on your own. Congratulations. Because you have fire, you no longer have to earn it. Here's your flint. [cheering] You now have your flint, same as Moto. Hopefully, you'll be able to keep your fire going. All right, for today's reward challenge, you will race head[1]to-head  as you slide down a slippery course to retrieve a numbered ball that I will  randomly assign each round. First tribe member to toss your ball into a basket scores a point for their  tribe. First tribe to six wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>ALL: Yeah! <br/>Probst: You will have a choice. First reward you might choose is a little taste of home in the form of your  luxury items. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: If that's not whetting your appetite... [gasping, murmuring] ...an  exact duplicate set of the fishing gear that Moto won. If you don't like either of those, third choice: instant gratification--  fresh fruit. In addition, the winning tribe will send one member from the losing tribe to  Exile Island. This time, however, that person will not be immune. They will rejoin their tribe before the next challenge. Moto, because you have one extra member, you're sitting somebody out. <br/>I want to sit out. <br/>Probst: Lisi going to sit out. Lisi, you'll take a spot on the bench; everybody else, bench; everybody else,  we'll get started. we'll get started. <br/>Probst: For the first round, it will be Anthony for Ravu; Gary, Papa Smurf,  for Moto. You are going for number nine. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, Gary! [teams shouting]  Probst: Gary trying to run, takes a hard fall. Anthony sliding his way across. Gary and Anthony both tiptoeing. Oh! Gary takes another one, hard. <br/>Go, Gary, go! <br/>Probst: Got to get it in the  Probst: Got to get it in the basket. basket. <br/>Come on, Ravu! <br/>Probst: First one to get it in scores a point for their tribe. Gary scores for Moto! Moto leads, one-zero. Next round will be two women. For Ravu, it is Rita taking on Cassandra. For Moto, going for number three. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, go! <br/>Go, Rita! <br/>Probst: Rita and Cassandra heading for number three. Oh! Cassandra takes a hard fall and turns it into a great slide! Cassandra has her ball. She knocks off Rita's. Cassandra's trying to stay up. Rita trying to stay up. <br/>Come on, baby! <br/>Probst: Got to get it in the bucket. Moto leads, one-zip. Choice of rewards on the line. Ravu scores! Rita scores for Ravu. We're tied, one-one. Next round will be Boo for Moto taking on Rocky for Ravu. You're going for number seven. Survivors ready? Go! Rocky and Boo. Boo getting a big sprint. Paddling right to number seven, grabs it on his way and heads to the basket. Rocky takes a fall right behind. Boo with one shot, scores for Moto! Moto leads, two-one. That is how you do it. Next round will be Michelle taking on Stacy for Moto. You are going for number six. Survivors ready? Go! [teams shouting] Stacy really working that slide, every bit of it. She's got her ball and drops it and falls. Michelle has hers and drops it. They're both gingerly tiptoeing. To the shooting line. Michelle tosses. She's short. Stacy just misses for Moto. Michelle just misses for Ravu. Stacy bounces it off the net! Moto leads, three-one. Next round will be Alex for Moto taking on Mookie for Ravu. <br/>Let's go, Mookie! <br/>Probst: You are going for number ten. Survivors ready? Go! It's a sprint. Mookie launches himself. Alex surfing across the course. Mookie has his ball. Alex has his and drops it and falls. Mookie gets off a shot, but it's missed. Mookie scores for Ravu! Moto leads, three-two. Next round will be Sylvia for Ravu taking on Liliana from Moto. Going for number two. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, Liliana! <br/>Probst: Oh! Sylvia takes a hard fall. Liliana right on target. She's got her ball, and she's heading to the shooting line. Sylvia struggling to get to her ball. A big lead for Liliana. Sylvia walking very gingerly, tiptoeing her way across this course. Giving Liliana a lot of free shots. Sylvia still not at the shooting line. Liliana scores for Moto! Moto leads, four-two. Next round will be Earl for Ravu taking on Edgardo for Moto. Going for number 11. Survivors ready? Go! Edgardo out of the gate quickly. Earl catches up quickly. Both guys now on their feet. Edgardo's got his ball. Earl has his. Edgardo launches his first shot and misses. Earl taking his time... and just misses for Ravu. Edgardo scores for Moto! Moto leads, five-two. Next round, Yau-Man for Ravu against Dre for Moto. <br/>[laughs loudly]  Probst: Moto leads, five-two. It takes six to win. Dre could win it right here for Moto. Yau-Man trying to keep Ravu in it. You are going for number five. Survivors ready? Go! [teams shouting] Yau-Man right in this with Dre. Dre has his ball. Yau-Man has his. Yau-Man looking very light on his feet. Dre misses short. Yau-Man with a nice toss, just misses. <br/>Come on, Dre! <br/>Probst: Oh! Dre's is in and out for Moto. Yau-Man needs to score to keep Ravu in it. Very close. Moto could win it with this shot. Just short. Yau-Man launches for Ravu. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Close again. Dre rims it. Ravu can stay alive. Yau-Man just misses. Dre scores for Moto! Dre scores for Moto! Moto wins reward! Moto wins reward! Moto, congratulations. You continue to dominate, undefeated in challenges thus far. Which of the three rewards are you going to take? <br/>The fishing gear. <br/>Probst: Fishing gear. Which tribe member of Ravu's are you going to send to Exile Island? <br/>Sylvia. <br/>Probst: Sylvia. <br/>I was afraid of that. <br/>Probst: Sylvia, grab your bag. Boat's waiting. <br/>Bye, sweetie. <br/>Good luck. Sorry. <br/>Probst: Moto, more riches. Come get your reward, head back Come get your reward, head back to camp. to camp. <br/>Today at challenge, I didn't do very well, and I'm very embarrassed by it. This is the second time I've been separated from my tribe in only seven days,  and they're probably sitting around and saying, "We should've let Sylvia  go sooner 'cause she's a real albatross around our neck." Clue number  three: "When night has fallen and the tribe is asleep, you'll find it  under the cave's threshold if you dig deep." Interesting. The third clue is so helpful. It said, dig right under the tallest part of the arch of the cave, and the  immunity idol will be there. I'm in a... probably the most tenuous position right now with my tribe. The idol is right smack-dab in the middle of camp, so I need to figure out a  time and a place to look for the idol as quickly as possible. <br/>SEVERAL [chanting]: Moto! Moto! Moto! [whooping]  Oh, man, we are eating good. <br/>Oh, yeah, baby! <br/>We take no prisoners, not even women and the children. <br/>I loved that challenge, seeing people slip and fall. <br/>I am so happy we got this. <br/>And as long as we keep the lead, our morale stays up, their morale goes  down-- bam, there it is right there, that whole game, every time. So funny when Papa Smurf fell down. [laughter]  That wasfunny. <br/>When he fell down, I was, like, "Golly!"  Who? <br/>Who? <br/>Papa Smurf. <br/>Papa Smurf. <br/>I've busted ribs before, and it feels like I... just like when I broke that  one, can't get a deep breath. Just... had some dizziness, uh, before, where I kind of just... and it feels  like it's the same thing. <br/>We were all sitting around, and all of a sudden, you know, we noticed Gary  wasn't doing too well. He took a pretty hard fall in the challenge, so, you know, we were just  concerned. So we got the medics to come out here and take a look at him. here and take a look at him. <br/>Is it hard for you to talk? <br/>Is it hard for you to talk? <br/>Is it hard for you to talk? <br/>No, no. <br/>No, no. <br/>Yeah... okay. <br/>Yeah... okay. <br/>And that's... I don't know...  And that's... I don't know...  He was afraid. He said he didn't want to die in Fiji. And that he was real afraid. He couldn't-- he didn't know where he was. I know this is a passion for him. A lot of people look at it as a game, but he's older. game, but he's older. And I just want him to be okay. And I just want him to be okay. And I just want him to be okay. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>See if that helps you. <br/>Okay. <br/>Will that be all right? <br/>Yes. <br/>All righty? <br/>Yes. <br/>The plan for now is to have Gary just rest for a while, see how he wakes up  in the morning. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Take care. <br/>But my thinking is if he cannot breathe, you know, it's... It's best for him  to just go It's best for him to just go and get that taken care of. and get that taken care of. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Gary's a great guy. I mean, we all kind of look up to the guy, and, you know, he's in our  prayers, and we just in our prayers, and we just hope he gets better. hope he gets better. <br/>Tree mail! Come and get it! <br/>We've got mail? <br/>Yep. <br/>"Keeping your tribe together won't require brawn. This one is a true test of will, and now it's time to get it on."  A physical one. <br/>No, it won't require brawn. It's endurance. <br/>Today, we're getting ready for another challenge. Don't know what it entails. It's kind of hard to speculate because, in this game, when you think it's  going one way, all think it's going one way, all of a sudden, it goes the  other. of a sudden, it goes the other. <br/>Gary showing up to the next challenge in this sort of weakened position is  going to hurt our tribe, so if it's going to be the case that he's just not  going to be able to perform, then it's in his best interest, as well as ours,  to just-- he should just call it quits. We're going to keep a close eye on him, and, you know, if anything happens,  his health is more important than the game to us. us. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. We'll now bring in Sylvia, We'll now bring in Sylvia, returning from Exile  Island. returning from Exile Island. First things first. Edgardo, bring me the immunity idol, please. idol, please. Thank you. Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will compete head-to-head in a compete head-to-head  in a food-eating competition. food-eating competition. Ravu very excited to have food. <br/>We're hungry! We're a lot hungrier than those guys, there. <br/>Probst: First tribe member to get their food down scores a point for their  tribe. First tribe to four wins immunity, guaranteed at least another day out here  in Fiji. Losers, Tribal Council tonight, somebody will be going home. First round, Liliana for Moto taking on Rocky from Ravu. I can assure you, everything you're going to eat today Fijians eat. First round is giant clams. [everyone groaning]  Probst: Eat it however you can get it down. When you're done, show me an empty mouth. If there's still something in there, I'll let you know. If you're good, I'll say you win. Three, two, one, eat. Rocky shoves it down his mouth. Trying to swallow it. Liliana taking her time and chewing. That's a lot of giant clam. No, you're not done. A little bit in the teeth. No, Rocky! For Ravu. Liliana, you still got it hanging down. Ravu leads one-zip. Just so we're clear, when I say empty mouth, it's got to be empty. If you got stuff hanging down, it's not empty. Next round is Sylvia for Ravu taking on Dreamz for Moto. <br/>Sylvia, you're hungry. <br/>Probst: Octopus. You will each eat one octopus You will each eat one octopus tentacle. tentacle. Ready? Ready? Three, two, one, eat. Three, two, one, eat. Those are big tentacles. Dreamz's chewing that like a piece of beef jerky. Sylvia's torn hers all apart into bite-size. <br/>Attagirl! Let's go! <br/>Probst: We are very close once again. Sylvia getting a lot of hers Sylvia getting a lot of hers down. down. Very close. Got to show me a completely empty mouth. Who can swallow fastest? Sylvia got a little nub on there. Don't lose it. Dre has it for Moto! We are tied one-one. Next round is Lisi taking on Mookie. Mookie. Peanut worms. Peanut worms. Moto leads two-one. You're playing to five. Three, two, one, eat. <br/>Go! <br/>Probst: Mookie digging in, chewing on those peanut worms. Lisi off to a slower start. <br/>Yeah! Chew it up! Chew it up! <br/>Probst: Mookie not messing around. Lisi is in trouble. Not looking good for Moto on this one. <br/>Come on, Mook. Come on! <br/>You're good. One more, baby, one more! <br/>Probst: Mookie taunting Lisi, trying to get her to vomit. Trying to get her to throw up. Mookie very close for Ravu. <br/>Show me the money, Mook! Show me the money, Mook. <br/>Probst: Mookie has it for Ravu! Ravu leads two-one. <br/>Was it nasty? <br/>It was nasty. <br/>Probst: You didn't like the taunting? <br/>Well, no, not at all. I mean, that-- that might have just have stopped our goodwill towards them. Goodwill and sportsmanship is to be humble. <br/>You guys taunt, too, bro. It's not one-sided brother. <br/>We don't taunt, and we still wish all the best of luck. <br/>I wish you the best of luck too, but it's all fair in love and war, baby. Chill out; relax. You blow off two people and then tell me how you feel, bro. <br/>Probst: Ready to keep going? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Please. <br/>Probst: It's going to be Earl for Ravu taking on Alex for Moto. Sea cucumber. <br/>Easy, bro. <br/>Got it. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one, go. Earl can't even hold on to his, he's so excited to eat. <br/>All right, Alex, come on. Come on! <br/>Come on, Alex! Come on, Alex! <br/>Probst: Alex working on his second piece of sea cucumber. Earl still working on his first. <br/>Come on, Earl! You're behind, baby! Come on. <br/>Probst: Alex now on his third and final piece of sea cucumber. <br/>Swallow it! Swallow it! <br/>Probst: Earl, it's mind over matter. <br/>Come on! <br/>Come on, Earl. Come on, come on, baby. <br/>Probst: Does he have it? Alex has it for Moto! We are tied two-two. <br/>No water... no water...  It wouldn't go down? <br/>Yeah-- no water. <br/>Probst: Next round is Michelle for Ravu taking on Edgardo for Moto. Fish eyes. <br/>Nice, Michelle. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one. Eat. Edgardo just swallowing, not even messing around. Michelle quickly falling behind. <br/>Come on, Michelle! Come on, Michelle! Come on, Michelle! <br/>Go, Michelle. <br/>Probst: Edgardo has it for Moto! Moto leads three-two. <br/>Yes! <br/>That's okay, Michelle. That's all right, baby. <br/>Probst: This could be the last round. It's going to be Papa Smurf for Moto, taking on Anthony for Ravu. A lot on the line. Gary, you could win immunity again for Moto. Anthony, fate is in your hands. You have to win or you guys are You have to win or you guys are going to  Tribal Council tonight. going to Tribal Council tonight. Let's see how you do with pig snouts. Still a little hair on the Still a little hair on the snout. snout. <br/>Come on, baby! <br/>Bacon, baby, bacon. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one, eat. <br/>Come on, Papa! <br/>Papa Smurf! <br/>Papa. <br/>Let's go, Anthony! <br/>Probst: Gary like he's done it every day of his life. Hammering that snout down. Anthony struggling to get it down. <br/>Hey, you don't got to chew all of it. You don't got to chew all of it. Just swallow, baby. <br/>We're behind, baby, come on! Chew fast! <br/>Probst: Papa Smurf starting on his second snout. <br/>Come on, Papa Smurf. <br/>Probst: Anthony has really slowed down his chewing. <br/>Come on Anthony! <br/>TEAM [chanting]: Papa Smurf! <br/>Probst: Gary puts down the the last bite. Anthony still struggling with that first bite. <br/>TEAM: Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf! <br/>Probst: Moto wins immunity  Probst: Moto wins immunity again! again! Moto remains undefeated so far in this game. Ravu, still winless, more bad news, Tribal Council tonight. Another member of your tribe going home. Grab your bags, head back to camp. camp. See you at Tribal. See you at Tribal. [squawking, chittering]  [yells] We lost again. <br/>That was a tough challenge. Hey. <br/>Four times in a row is hard. What are you gonna do? <br/>I just want to let you guys know I was absolutely mortified yesterday by my  performance, okay? I just wanted to say I'm really sorry that I let the team down on that one  challenge. <br/>If, at the moment, that was the best you can do, then...  Okay, thanks for letting me get it off my chest. [indistinct chatter] I don't know if the tribe is still connected to me. I certainly still feel connected to the tribe. But I was gone for almost 24 hours, and... I've been a target since first day. Because I'm definitely the oldest woman, and the least amount of strength,  probably the least amount of skills. It is absolutely essential that I find the idol before Tribal Council, or  else I will be the Council, or else I will be the next one voted off. next one voted off. <br/>She's trying a bit too hard. <br/>I'm right there with you. I'm just trying to keep my butt in the game. I'm trying not to scramble around too much. I think that Sylvia's getting voted out tonight. Probably the most interesting complication that can happen during Tribal  Council will be if Sylvia actually has the idol. And if she breaks it out, it's gonna change up some... everything. Because whoever she picks... goes home. <br/>So, let's run over what we're gonna do tonight, huh? <br/>Um...  Sylvia's... Basically, the majority, uh, is gonna vote for Sylvia on this  one, all right? <br/>Okay. Mm-hmm. <br/>And then, to back it up, just in case she does have the idol-- 'cause, you  know, she's playing off like she doesn't, but not a big deal-- we'll put  Anthony's name in there, too, 'cause we...  So we have a backup. <br/>Yeah. Cool? <br/>Sounds like a plan. <br/>Ready, break? Ready, break. All right. <br/>James approached me and said that the plan was that Sylvia was gonna be voted  out unless she had the immunity idol, and, then, in which case, we would be  voting, uh, Anthony out. <br/>Does he irk you at all, or no? no? Yeah. Yeah. He just seems like a... like a... like a... a little on the whiny side, you  know? <br/>Well, like, he's so wishy-washy. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I don't want to vote out either Sylvia or Anthony. We've made our voting decisions, supposedly, to try to make the tribe  stronger, but the reality is that it hasn't. So I'm gonna do something that's So I'm gonna do something that's not  "with the tribe." not "with the tribe."  Anthony, he's... he's the most, you know... I don't know what's going on in  his mind. And especially today, when someone puts a gun to your head, "Finish this  in a minute." I don't care if you have no water in your mouth, you're  going to finish it. He was still on the same little bit, and then he's, like, complaining about  it. <br/>That bothered you, huh? <br/>This bit! Anthony just... I was not happy at all with his performance in the challenge. He's just not that strong, and I think it's just the effort that he put  forward that just really irritated me. So, uh...  Mm-hmm? <br/>Where's Anthony? <br/>Not around. <br/>So you're good with that, Sylvia? <br/>Mm-hmm, yeah. <br/>Okay. <br/>I'm good. I'm not sure how it's going to go tonight. I mean, I hear, supposedly, that majority is going to vote for Anthony, but  I'm not feeling really absolutely certain. I am pretty sure I know where the idol is. From the three clues that have been given out so far, it seems to me that  it's going to be at the threshold of the tallest point of the cave. So I still have a little bit of time before Tribal Council, and I'm going to  dig right now and try to get that idol as my insurance policy. If I get the idol now, and if the vote does go my way, I will the vote does  go my way, I will be able to surprise everybody. be able to surprise everybody. <br/>Probst: Let's start with a quick poll, one word answers. What is the state of the tribe? Anthony. <br/>Tired. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man. <br/>Not very happy. <br/>Probst: Michelle. <br/>Hungry. <br/>Probst: Rocky. <br/>Tired. <br/>Probst: Mookie. <br/>Bad. <br/>Probst: I'm watching a group of people that are disintegrating, emotionally,  before my eyes. Mookie, what needs to happen with this tribe? The game is slipping through your fingers. <br/>We need to come through in a challenge. Uh, I think the more we lose, the idea the rich get richer, the poor get  poorer, comes to seep into our minds, and, uh, it's starting to mess with us,  definitely. <br/>Probst: Sylvia, you struggled in the reward challenge. <br/>I did. I mean, I was just mortified for disappointing the tribe, for not getting  that one more basket in. The second thing was a little bit of self-performance here: why are you not  able to do the clutch move when you need to do it? <br/>Probst: Anthony, today, you squared off against Gary-- Papa Smurf. The head-to-head between you two guys was over before it started. <br/>I was just trying to swallow, and I had no spit to swallow. You know, I was out here in the tropics chewing pig snout and enjoying it. I just couldn't swallow it. <br/>Probst: Rocky, trust. Does it start to become even more difficult, when you lose time after time  after time, to trust people? <br/>I think it becomes more important. You have to trust that there is a possibility that one day you are going to  snap out of this and you're going to start winning. If you lose that, you might as well just not even show up to the game. <br/>Probst: Anthony, Mookie trustworthy? <br/>I think Mookie is pretty trustworthy. I'm generally the person who, for the most part, gives people the benefit of  the doubt. <br/>Probst: The problem with that is, by the time you figure out you can't trust  him, it could be as you're walking out of here. <br/>You know, I often wonder if the... if these folks even like me. I think... I like to think they like me, but you know, sometimes you can't  tell. <br/>Probst: Mookie, what's your thought on what Anthony said? <br/>To be honest, after the challenge, I was really pissed off. And one person that just brought me over the top was Anthony. I understand that it's hard to swallow, but when you take a little piece of  snout this small, you can will yourself to throw it down. <br/>Probst: Anthony, he's not only saying you didn't have enough effort today,  he's questioning your will to win. <br/>I have the will to win. I have the will to be here. I have the will to keep going through this game. I'm out there in the same stuff with you, dude. I guess I pissed you off. Okay, fine. But, you know, you want to question my will...  I don't... I don't want to make it personal. The thing is...  Well, you know, it's gonna be personal. <br/>Not everyone was able to put it down. <br/>Well, apparently I'm the only one who put you over the top. <br/>Probst: One last topic to talk about: hidden immunity idol. Earl's been out there once, Sylvia twice. What was the mood back at camp today, Rocky, knowing she had three clues? Were you trying to figure out if she had the idol or not? <br/>Of course we are. She could be holding it in her back pocket right now. I don't know. <br/>Probst: Okay, if somebody does indeed have the hidden immunity idol and you  want to play it, you would play it after the votes have been cast, before I  read them. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Mookie, you're up. Mookie, you're up. <br/>It's not your will. <br/>It's not your will. It's your attitude. It's your attitude. <br/>I just got to know if you  I just got to know if you have the idol or not. have the idol or not. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. <br/>Probst: If you have the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now is  the time want to play it, now is the time to do so. to do so. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. Council area immediately. First vote, Sylvia. First vote, Sylvia. Anthony. Sylvia. Two votes Sylvia, one vote Anthony. Anthony-- two votes Anthony. Sylvia-- three votes Sylvia. Anthony. We're tied: three votes We're tied: three votes Anthony, three votes Sylvia.

Third person voted out of Survivor: Fiji...Sylvia. Survivor: Fiji...Sylvia. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Sylvia, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Probst: Well, one good thing that came out of tonight's Tribal Council: a  little honesty. Maybe it will make a difference. Grab your torches. Grab your torches. Go back to camp. Go back to camp. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:  I just can't... I can't function. <br/>Probst: Gary breaks down. <br/>His head spinning is just getting worse. <br/>If he doesn't get better, he's going to have to go. <br/>Probst: Liliana makes a move on the guys. [laughing] And Anthony takes a beating. <br/>You get all sentimental and sensitive. <br/>There's no way in hell I'm  There's no way in hell I'm gonna give it up. gonna give it up. <br/>So I've been had, and, um, I'm not too happy about it. Um, I actually really, really liked the entire group of both tribes because  we had three days to get to know everybody, and I'm not that angry or  resentful right now. I'm just looking forward to seeing them all after they've clawed each other's  eyes out later on.
