<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor:  Where's that snake mother ... Jon? <br/>Probst: Tempers flared after Rupert was voted out. <br/>Every time a plan went down, you put it together. <br/>Probst: And Christa was blamed for throwing out the fish. <br/>We can't sabotage the tribe. <br/>I didn't do it. <br/>Probst: But Sandra was the true culprit. <br/>They're not going to enjoy Rupert's fish-- screw that. <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge, the castaways were  surprised by the arrival of their loved ones. [ sobbing ]  Come here. <br/>Probst: But Jon was told by his best friend that his  grandmother had died. The tribe let Jon win the reward so he could spend time with his  best friend. As part of the reward, the rest of the tribe was exiled to a  deserted island, giving Jon and his friend exclusive use of the Balboa camp,  where they celebrated the success of a devious lie. <br/>That was a brilliant performance, sir. <br/>He was like, "If you come down here, tell me my  grandma died."  The fake dead grandmother could easily go down as the  dirtiest thing ever to be done in this game. <br/>Probst: When the tribe returned, Jon went right to work,  strategizing with Burton. <br/>I just want it to be the two of us in the final two. <br/>Probst: But Sandra and Tijuana were secretly listening in. <br/>It was better for her to hear it with her own ears coming  out of their mouths than for me to put things in her head and for her to have  doubts. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, the survivor's  vocabulary skills were tested. Darrah wins immunity. Nice job. Before Tribal Council, Jon pleaded with his two enemies in a  desperate attempt to save Burton's skin. <br/>Jon, you just don't know how much we distrust you. <br/>I swear on my grandmother. That's a big freakin' deal. <br/>Probst: The plea worked, and at Tribal Council, it was  Tijuana who was voted out. The tribe has spoken. Six are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION [theme  song playing] You think Jon would lie? <br/>You think Jon would lie? <br/>I'm-I'm starting to think so. I think he laid it on us good, and we didn't look at the bigger,  bigger picture, and, um, now we're screwed. <br/>Tribal Council was very interesting, based upon a  last-minute decision to get rid of T. Jon made an agreement that he would take Sandra and I to the top  four, along with Burton. <br/>I'll just see what I can do. <br/>I don't know whether or not to believe him, because... I  can't believe him ever. <br/>Burton's totally cool, so last thing I want for you guys  is doubt. Christa made me swear on my grandmother's grave that I would  carry Christa and Sandra to the final four. And I-I believe I used the phrase before: Promises are like  wicker furniture and fat women: easily broken by Jonny Fairplay. I've rolled the dice a lot in this game. <br/>Don't go rolling it on me. <br/>Look, I'm happy now. Don't make me unhappy. Let's just ride this thing out to final four; we'll be fine. <br/>All right. I really hope he's telling us the truth. Probably not. I don't know. I think that Sandra and I have a better chance of getting ahead  with four women than Burton, Jon, myself and Sandra. <br/>Are you ready? <br/>Yeah. We don't have to bring a thousand woods, right? Just one, quick, dry wood run. Me and Christa, we've been tight since, like, day number two or  three. But without Darrah right now, I can't move another step. I can't take another step without knowing where Darrah stands  right now. She voted for Burton last night. She shouldn't have a problem voting for him either tomorrow or  the next day. The deal we made yesterday to save Burton's skin was that you or  Lill would go first, but it didn't matter to us who went when, right? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Now, I want the guys to go. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>You understand what I'm saying? <br/>Yeah. Uh-huh. <br/>You think that'll work? <br/>Yeah. Sandra's already talked to me this morning. I mean, I'm sure there'll be a bunch of different ones coming up  to me, trying to sway votes and stuff. So, I'm just going to play it, you know, let them come up to me  and see what's going on. And then, I'll decide what I need to do after that. <br/>I still think that Burton is a bigger threat than Jon. <br/>I do, too. <br/>Then, we'll get Jon on the next shot because Jon is just  like a girl. <br/>Right. <br/>Wait till you see what's in the bag. <br/>Oh, my goodness. <br/>Oh, Big Daddy. <br/>Should we save some for lunch? <br/>Yeah, I'm cool with whatever. <br/>We got mail. <br/>Come read it over here. <br/>"It's nice to be pampered. For you, it's been a while. Refresh yourself inside and out. We're talking life and style. This luxurious reward, you'll really want to get. But if you move too slowly, all you'll get is wet."  Whenever I hear "wet" and "water,"  that's awful for me. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! 31 days. Congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: For today's reward challenge, you will compete in  teams of three, which we will randomly draw in a moment. Here's how it works: You're going to compete in a water obstacle  course. First tribe member starts on the first platform where you must  cross a balance beam. You'll then dive in and untie two paddles from two separate  wooden crates. You'll then swim to a second platform, join your second tribe  member. You'll dive back into the water and release three underwater  floating barrels. Together, the two of you will then swim to a third platform. You'll untie a third paddle, join your third tribe member, and  all three of you will swim to shore. You'll then get in your boat and paddle back to the start. First tribe to get back to the start in their boat with all  three tribe members wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Well, after 31 days, you deserve a little TLC. So, today's reward is an overnight spa. You'll be flown to a remote resort island. You can then enjoy a massage. For dinner, you'll order whatever you want and you'll awaken to  a breakfast. There is a swimming pool. So, for the winning tribe: your swimsuits. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: The first clothes you've seen from those suitcases  you left behind 31 days ago. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Hell, yeah. <br/>Probst: All right. There are three silver coins and three gold coins. They are numbered "one," "two" and  "three." "One" refers to the first position;  "two" to the second position; and "three" to the third  position. Open up. Let's see our tribes. <br/>One? Oh, Lord. <br/>Probst: Sandra, you are in the first position. You're going to be swimming the most. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Christa, you are with Sandra at second position. Burton, you're the tail. You will be swimming the least. For you, Darrah, it's all on you. Then Lill and Jon. Head on out to your spots. For a great reward, Survivors ready? Go! Oh. Sandra took a chinner on the first platform. Darrah with just a bit of a lead, starting to work on her first  paddle. Sandra at work on her first paddle. Darrah swimming toward her second paddle. Sandra has her first paddle. Darrah has the second paddle. She's got to get up on the platform. Go! Darrah and Lill onto the second stage. Sandra still working on her second paddle. Darrah and Lill heading for the barrels. <br/>Slide above the end! Push it! <br/>Probst: Got to release three barrels, Darrah. Darrah has her first barrel. Lill working on that third paddle. Let's go, Sandra. Get that knot off. You guys are not that far behind. Darrah has her second barrel. Sandra still having trouble with her second paddle. Darrah has her third barrel. Lill working on that third paddle. They've got the third paddle. Lill, Darrah and Jon in the water on the third stage. <br/>Undo it! Undo it! Quick! Quick! <br/>Probst: Sandra has the second paddle. Christa helps her up. Get in the water. Take the paddles. You've got it. I'll get you the second you get here. <br/>Come on, girls. <br/>Probst: Jon, Lill and Darrah really having a hard time  with their boat. Christa has the first barrel up. Christa has the second barrel up, making up a lot of ground  quickly. Christa has her third barrel. Lill, Darrah and Jon starting their paddle back to the finish. Stage two is done. Burton's now in this. Swimming back to shore, going for the boat. It's going to be too little, too late. [ yells ] It's over. Lill, Darrah, Jon. Overnight spa reward. Lill? Bring your boat in. You guys will be taken to a plane, dinner, anything you want off  the menu, breakfast tomorrow, good night's sleep, air conditioning. <br/>This could be the best reward in the history of the game. <br/>This is awesome. <br/>After Jon, D, and I won the award, we got on a boat, took  a tour of the island, and got put on a plane. <br/>[ Lill gasps ] Look at this! <br/>Oh, I cannot wait to get in that bathtub. <br/>Food, here we come. <br/>Let's party! <br/>It was amazing to see our home from above. There's our island, guys. <br/>Yep, there's our island. <br/>It sure is. <br/>I wish it was me. <br/>[ Jon speaks inaudibly ]  It is so gorgeous. It was a breathtaking view. It was something that I'm not going to forget for a long time. <br/>We've only seen the Pearl Islands via our boat. Words can't describe how big this place is. I mean, there's just ocean, ocean, ocean, ocean, and the biggest  islands you've ever seen and the smallest islands you've ever seen. There was just so many of them everywhere. <br/>That was fabulous. [ cheerful scream ]  Oh, wow. <br/>Oh, my gosh! Look at this! <br/>We had no idea how cool the hotel would be. And when we got here, it's, uh... this is absolute paradise. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>The room is huge. There was a big living room, a huge bedroom, a big bathroom,  mirrors. <br/>Whoo! <br/>[ screams ]  Wow. <br/>Oh, my gosh...  It's not me! <br/>Look at my eyebrows. <br/>That first look at myself in a mirror was so shocking. Oh, my gosh! <br/>I have lost so much weight. <br/>I hadn't seen myself for... 30-some days. <br/>Shower. <br/>Shower! <br/>Oh, this feels so good. <br/>We might tell D she's, uh... she's top three, just to keep  her from jumping. <br/>I won't say a word. <br/>This was, bar none, the greatest reward we could be given  at this stage of the game. It gave me a chance, personally, to talk with D and Lill  without, uh, worrying about, uh, Sandra and Christa overhearing, and gave me  a chance to, uh, heal up some of my, uh, war wounds from the first, uh,  30-plus days. <br/>Oh, baby. The masseuse put cucumbers over my eyes. I guess they do something for the skin. I think I needed a whole cucumber to do anything for my my skin. <br/>Oh, this is the best. The Pearl Islands are paradise. However, it sucks with the bugs. It sucks with some of the people. It sucks with the food. Yeah. <br/>Oh! <br/>Here, this is paradise and that's an awesome feeling. <br/>Oh, my gosh, this lady is good. <br/>I feel sorry for Burton today. <br/>Hope this doesn't have to be a clean fillet, 'cause I am  shredding this thing. <br/>Did Jon talk to you about everything? You're not going to screw us over? <br/>No, I haven't. I haven't even talked to him about anything. Jon said, if we saved you, that Darrah and Lill would go. <br/>Okay! I, I haven't even talked to Jon. He just said...  Jon told us the wrong thing. He said that we'd be in the final four; it would be two and  two-- you and him and Sandra and I. <br/>I'm in... I'm in a bit of an odd position right now, in  that I am alone in the camp with Sandra and Christa. And I haven't talked to Jon fully about this, so I don't know  what to tell them. I mean, I've lied to them enough. I guess I could continue to lie. But at the same time, I don't want to piss them off, because  they're going to be on the jury and I want to be the one they vote for. We all came together and we both saved each other. Well, if Christa wasn't on the chopping block, it'd be one  thing. You didn't make that voting decision to save me. <br/>Burton has never been one to talk to me and Christa  clearly about anything. But let it be known that if it wasn't for me and Christa, Burton  would not be here today. You would think that that would count for something. And then here he is saying that he, he can't promise us third  and fourth. That's a bunch of baloney. The first chance I get to send him home, he's going home. <br/>It's just hard to tell. I can't tell when people lie anymore. Like, people can tell when I'm lying. I'm looking at them just like...  Well, the thing is around here is, like... just,  everyone's lying to everyone. The only time you know where someone stands is when they vote at  Tribal Council. The conversation that Sandra and I had with Burton was a real  eye-opener for me. It was, uh... I saw the light suddenly. <br/>I mean, no matter how strong your best friend is out here,  at the end of the day, it's not as strong as a million dollars. <br/>At this point, it's every man for themselves, I see it. We're not here to make best friends. We're not here to do anything like that. We're here to play a game and get as far as we can. <br/>Ooh! Oh, we got pajamas. <br/>No way. [ Lill squeals ]: Oh, you're kidding! <br/>Oh, they're silk. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>On our bed was silky pajamas. We put them on, pranced around, showed them off. This is so exciting. <br/>This is so wonderful. <br/>I think we have a table for three. <br/>When we got to dinner, I was starving. And I, I... It was so nice to be able to open a menu up and to  be able to read. I did remember how to read after all this time. My mouth is watering. <br/>Chicken fingers will definitely be a good appetizer. <br/>What about the clam? <br/>Lill, you really want to do clam after 31 days of eating  nothing but seafood? I'll order for you guys. For dinner, she would like the filet mignon. <br/>I love a man that takes over. <br/>Me, too. <br/>How would you like that prepared? <br/>Um, medium rare. <br/>Medium rare. <br/>Jon ordered all the food for all of us. I enjoyed that. You know, I, I like when a guy takes the initiative. Rock and roll, man. Rock and roll. I'm a great date. I have a pretty extensive fine food knowledge, and I was able to  show that off. [ Lill gasps ]  Oh, my goodness. Oh, my... What's that? <br/>That's bruschetta. <br/>You're a whole lot more smarter than me. <br/>There's a few more sides to Jonny Fairplay than these  girls had any clue about. And as Lill said, I'm much more than just a pretty face. I have noticed Sandra and Christa will never give me a vote. <br/>Out in the water...  Yeah. <br/>...they said to me, "We're going to kick out Jon  "and we're going to kick out, um, Burton. <br/>Are you with us?" When we were eating, we talked a  lot about what's been going on behind the scenes. I know that Jon had to promise Christa and Sandra a lot in order  for them to back us up to get rid of T. I had to promise on my grandmother to them. Oh, no, no, no, no! Don't do that. I had to. She's looking down here at you. I know. She'll forgive me. I had so much fun in explaining to, uh, D and Lill that, uh,  Christa made me swear on my grandmother's grave. And I told Lill that it upset me so much to have to do that. And I was like, "One of her last wishes was that, that I  win." [ laughing ] [ laughing ] Lill is very antsy and there was lots of  strategy that we needed to go over, uh, for the last stage of the game. There's a lot of people worried about you, Lill. <br/>Why? <br/>Because. Who whispered this morning that like...  Lill is the queen of sitting around the camp  going...  I am not! <br/>Yes, you are. I am not! <br/>You hurt my feelings...  Lill, I'm going to keep hurting your feelings unless you  start telling the truth. <br/>I'm going to bed. <br/>Lill, that's not helping anything. <br/>I'm going to bed. You hurt my feelings. <br/>Lill, you're... you're doing more damage than anything. <br/>Lill, get in here. We got stuff to talk about. <br/>Jon talks down to me like I'm some idiot. Lill, it's the truth. Make me sound like a big-mouth. It is not the truth. He wants to show that he's in charge and... you know, I've seen  that before. And I'm thinking that may be his way of separating himself from  me. [ thunder crashing ]  So, I was thinking about Darrah. I tell you, after that that challenge, I fear her most in  something like that, 'cause I think she has a good chance of winning. <br/>Yep. Watch your step on here. <br/>This morning, Christa and I went out looking for mussels  to eat. And she brought up a strategy, again, what I was thinking. But she is willing to make concessions, and she's looking, um,  to get farther in the game. So, it's a good thing to know. Well, let me ask you this... Without having talked to Jon, I  have no idea what's going on. <br/>But...  But... would you vote Sandra out next if that was the  case? <br/>I would go along with it, if that's what you guys wanted  me to do and get rid of her first. But from a strategic standpoint, and just seeing how Darrah is  most likely to win immunity... I mean, I know that it's probably not going to  be something super physical, but Darrah was a cheerleader and she can hang in  for long periods of time, you know? Right. <br/>Nothing Christa said this morning really surprised me. I had a feeling she would stab Sandra in the back if she needed  to. She does really want Darrah to go first. All the options are still open, but it might not be bad to have  Christa in the top four. Because if Jon did do something funny, um, I'm pretty sure I  could beat Christa at Tribal Council. I think she's rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. I would like to see you in the top four. I really want to go to the top four. And I will do what I can to get you there. So, you... you got my word on that. <br/>I think that Burton understands that this is a game, and  we're all trying to get ahead. Me stabbing Sandra in the back and getting rid of her... isn't  anything personal. It's nothing about that. It's about getting farther ahead and doing the right thing to  win this game. <br/>Good morning. <br/>This morning, we awoke to a big, fresh pot of coffee and,  uh, bacon, eggs, the most amazing banana nut bread on the planet, fresh O.J,  fresh fruit. Great way to start the day and yet another advantage that we  have over the others going into the final. <br/>I see Survivor as a big game of human chess. I felt that I could feed off Darrah's greed and basically say,  "Hey, look, you know, there's no way anyone can beat Lill in a  jury." And she agreed. I was like, you know, "So, "without, uh, without  anyone knowing, how about me and you Final Two?" And she did the math in  her head, and she was, like, "I think you're exactly right."  Okay. I won't say anything else about it. <br/>It's going to be me and... and Jon in the Final Two. I mean, Jon, you know, he's a snake. He lies, but... he also tells the truth, too. And, I don't... I know he's not sitting here lying to me about  going to the Final Two. <br/>I want to know everything. Start from when the boat left...  When Jon, Lill and Darrah returned from the reward, I was  happy to see them, because I was glad the reward was over for them. I'm still jealous. But I wanted to hear everything. I want to hear everything from the beginning to the end. <br/>All right, so, let me... We'll start at the beginning. Big bed, enough for three people, shower, commode, toothbrush,  shampoo...  [screams]  I wanted to kind of play it down a little bit, but he told  them every detail there was. And I thought, "Well, okay. It's not me telling it and bragging on it." Filet mignon,  cheeseburger, another filet mignon. <br/>Bastard! <br/>We ate for four hours. [ Jon laughing ]  Get out. <br/>Jon, please tell me you're at least hung over. Well, they're taking it pretty good. <br/>But, um...  All a front. All a front. <br/>So, what did you guys talk about? <br/>Everything's set. I told Lill "top three" wh-when Darrah was in the  shower. I told D, "There's no way we can beat Lill or, uh, Burton  in a jury." I was, like, "So, it's me and you." She goes,  "I was thinking the exact same thing."  After talking to Jon, it sounds like he did a great job,  basically promising Lill and Darrah, um, enough so that they should never  break this alliance. I'm not worried about D, and I'm not worried about Lill. <br/>Well, then, who's next? <br/>Huh? <br/>Who's next? <br/>Christa's next. <br/>So, you're going to blindside Christa? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay. <br/>Is that cool with you? <br/>Yeah, I mean... Why are you flip-flopping on Christa? No, no. I'm not flip-flopping. <br/>You can't be nice on any of these screwing-over people,  you know? Like, we both have to be equally as evil. <br/>Yeah. Dude, we're both...  Okay. <br/>My strategy at this point in the game is to work with Jon. Jon's the bad cop, I'm the good cop. As we kick these people out of the game, if it all works as  planned, they will be mad at Jon and not me. Assuming nothing changes, you and I are guaranteed top two. <br/>I know. <br/>So, neither of us will change. <br/>That's... it's a guarantee. <br/>Oh, man...  That's... it's a guarantee. <br/>Oh, man... I just want to sleep. [ mutters ] This game runs my life 24 hours a day. <br/>I know it does. <br/>I've had two dreams since I've been here that weren't  related to the game. <br/>Are you still, you know, I'm asking... Are you still  thinking that we're the Final Two? <br/>I'm really not thinking. I... don't want to think that far in advance. Okay, you're telling me now that you've had second thoughts. That's not true. I think two Tribal Councils in advance. <br/>Last night, I couldn't sleep. And I got up and went to the fire. I asked him, "So, are you still comfortable with this...  you and I at the end?" And he said, "Let's just do one at a  time."  I can't help but feeling you're having second thoughts. [ muttering indistinctly ]  Yeah, but Lill, that's in your head. I'm not having thoughts. <br/>Okay. All right. I just want to be prepared that I know where I stand. I am not going to screw you over, okay? <br/>Okay. What I have told Lill is that I will never lie to her in this  game. I told her I'd take her as far as I could. And I do have an allegiance with her, and I do have an alliance  with her. But I have never promised her top two. <br/>Well, I have a feeling I'd better make immunity, then. <br/>It ticks me a little bit. Matter of fact, it pisses me off a little bit, but... what can I  do about it? Um... the only thing that would save me is to win immunity at  the end. Then that may even justify me to turn my back on him. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! to turn my back on him. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! All right, let's get to today's immunity challenge. Darrah, give it up. Nice to have it on, isn't it? <br/>Yeah, it feels good. <br/>Immunity back up for grabs. For today's immunity challenge, you will fire traditional pirate  muskets. They've been modified to shoot flares. You'll be shooting at targets. You each have three targets. First person to hit all three targets wins immunity. Everybody else, vulnerable at tonight's Tribal Council. Take your spots. Wait for my "Go." First three: Christa, Lill and  Sandra. Christa, you're up first. Ever shot a gun before? <br/>Never shot a gun in my entire life. <br/>Probst: Let me... let me give you a hand. Yeah, put this hand... under here, right under here, like  you're... There you go. And you're gonna pull this back, and then you're gonna fire the  trigger. <br/>Probst: Look at that. First time she shoots a gun, hits her target. One target down for Christa. <br/>Nice shot. <br/>Probst: Lill. Little low. Sandra. Little low. Step back. Next three, step in. Jon, Darrah and Burton. Jon... looking for your first target. Just a little to the left. <br/>[ sighs ]  Probst: All right, Darrah, show them how it's done. I know you want immunity again. Darrah connects. On the board with her first target. Nice shooting. Burton. Nails his first target on his first hit. End of the first round... Christa has one hit, Burton has one  hit, Darrah has one hit. Next three, up. Everybody rotate one position to your right. Sandra, looking for your first hit. Takes her aim. Fires a little low. Christa, looking for your second target. Look at that. Christa nails another target. Two for two. Lill takes her aim. Lill just low again. Step back. Next three, up. Burton, hit your target on your first shot. Burton with his second shot, looking for a second target to stay  tight with Christa. And he just misses, just low. Jon, looking for his first hit. Jon low. All right, Darrah. Looking for your second hit. And she does. Good shot. Darrah on the board with two targets. Step back. Next three, up. Here's where we're at: Christa on the board with two hits,  Darrah with two hits, Burton with one. Christa, looking for her third and final target. Oh! <br/>Damn, I was happy for you. <br/>Wow. Hit the wood. That was close. <br/>Probst: Hit the wood. Close, but no cigar. Lill connects. Lill on the board. Sandra with her first hit, on the board with one. Here's where we're at: Christa on the board with two hits,  Darrah with two hits, Lill, Sandra, Burton each with one. Darrah, looking for her third and final target. If she hits it, she'll win immunity. And she hits it. Whoo! Darrah has hit all three targets. Darrah wins immunity for the second time. Get up here. Once again, the smallest girl out here is the safest. The other five of you, somebody going home. Head back to your camp. I'll see you guys at the Tribal Council. <br/>Congratulations, Darrah. <br/>Deadeye Darrah. <br/>I almost won immunity. I almost, almost always win immunity, but that's never good  enough. I feel absolutely vulnerable. You know, right when you think something, uh, things go  completely... opposite. <br/>We turned the tables once, I'm sure we can turn the tables  again. It's going to be the women, watch. I'm going to go home. I feel like I'm going to go home now. You got saved once. You're about to get saved again. <br/>We want Burton gone, because he's the strongest one out  here. Although he hasn't won these immunities, but that doesn't mean  anything. Physically, he's stronger than we are, and to put it all on an  equal playing field, we want all the females together till the end. Would you be willing to vote him off tonight? <br/>Burton? <br/>Yes or no? <br/>No. <br/>No? You're going with who, with Lill? <br/>Yeah, I'm voting for Lill. So, Lill is it tonight? Mm-hmm? <br/>I just want to make sure everybody was on the same sheet  of music. <br/>I think he's already telling her right now. <br/>Really? I feel bad. <br/>There's a word in the English language, uh, called  "naive" and, uh, some people are that, and, obviously, those people  are playing this game. <br/>I'm being told that it's still Christa that will be  leaving tonight, but that doesn't mean that I can't, you know, organize my  stuff, pack my shells. Never take anything for granted. <br/>They're not going to give up Lill. That's bull...  It would throw everything off. They're not giving up Lill. Jon is a snake. Jon will never be anything other than a snake, but the fact is  that Christa keeps telling me, "Sandra, I honestly believe him. "He swore on his grandmother. Therefore, he can't be lying." If I were you, I'd be  looking out for myself. You need to look out for you. You and me. Well, and this is how we're going to stay alive. This is how we're going to stay alive. <br/>Trust is nothing at this point in the game. It's cutthroat. Everybody wants to get to the end. Everybody wants to go one more place. Lying is the way to go out here. Everybody has done it, and everybody has done it well. <br/>Probst: Now, bring in the and everybody has done it well. <br/>Probst: Now, bring in the members of our jury-- Ryno...  Rupert... and T, voted out at the last Tribal Council. 33 days you've been out here. Tonight, I want you to catch me up on where this tribe is at as  we head into the six days. Jon, at this point in the game, would you describe the game as  "friendly," "mean," "competitive...?"  I would best describe this point in time in the game as the  most hope-filled, in which you have to hope that the people that you're  aligning yourself with are telling you the truth. Hope that you can outlast them, hope that you're carrying the  right person to the end. Burton, do you think this game somehow gives you a license to  lie and betray and cheat? <br/>It's, it's part of the game. You've got to deceive people. You have to make them think one thing and do another. I mean, it's just like any competitive game. You're trying to fake out the other team, and you're trying to  get farther at their expense. <br/>Probst: Christa, have you lied in this game? <br/>Uh... I think I've lied a few times. Um, definitely, I've kind of tried to have this philosophy from  day one not to lie to anybody or at least just, if I don't have to say  anything at all, you know, I don't have to say it. <br/>Probst: Sandra, who would you hate to go up against in the  Final Two? Lill. Why? Everybody loves Lill. She, um...  Aw...  I mean, like, to go up against Lill would be suicidal,  and, uh, she's the only one here that I... I feel like that about. Lill, does it worry you a little bit that you're the oldest  Survivor out here, you represent the Boy Scout, and everybody loves you, in a  game in which you want to put yourself against somebody that people don't  like? It worries, it worries me that the jury would base their  decision on somebody that is nice. Um, there's more to it than nice; there's strategy there, not  just something... someone that is nice. <br/>Probst: Christa, why not you tonight? <br/>Um,I think I've rubbed some people the wrong way... a lot  of people the wrong way, and that might be one reason that I might stick  around tonight and not be voted off. <br/>Probst: So, back to the likability factor, it might help  you tonight that a couple of people don't like you. Everything is completely unpredictable all the time, you know? There's no trust here. It's all about hope, you know? Jon, do you trust your relationships in this game-- right now? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Sandra, you trust your alliances? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Christa, how about you? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Lill? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Burton? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Darrah? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: So, we just sat here tonight and talked about  lying and betrayal and deceit, but you all trust your relationships. This is going to be interesting. Darrah, you're wearing immunity. Want to give it up? <br/>No. <br/>Probst: She's keeping it. Darrah's the only person you can't vote for. You all trust each other. You have no idea what the vote's gonna be. So let's find out. Jon, it is time to vote. You're up. <br/>Whether you like it or don't like it, learn to love it,  because it's the best thing going today. Whoo! <br/>Hopefully, everybody else is doing the same thing and  voting for you. <br/>You always treated me with kindness. Um, this is totally strategic, because I'd hate to go up against  you. You're too much of a kind person and I know they'd just hand you  the money and I can't and I can't have that happen. Adios. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Christa. Lill. One vote Lill, one vote Christa. Lill. That's two votes Lill, one vote Christa. Christa. Christa. Three votes Christa, two votes Lill. 11th person voted out of the tribe. Christa. You need to bring me your torch. Christa, the tribe has spoken. You guys told me you trusted Christa, the tribe has spoken. You guys told me you trusted your relationships, and yet, on the  heels of Rupert and T., a third surprising vote with only six days left and  five very clearly skilled liars still in it. Should be a fun finish. You guys can get your torches. Head back to camp.

We definitely have an intellectual advantage. <br/>Probst: The girls are getting fed up. <br/>The sooner we get rid of these jackasses, the better. <br/>Probst: And it all comes to a head. <br/>I swear on my grandmother. I swear, I swear, I swear. Now, do you guys have a plan or not? <br/>I wasn't quite expecting to get voted off tonight. It's really surprising to see how everybody out here fooled me  at every moment of this entire game, but I've made really great friends. Sandra and Rupert, both of them have kept me happy this whole  entire time. It's been an adventure of a lifetime.
