<br/>I’m not going to wrestle  over this. <br/>I am standing there with  the idol in my little pink shorts, and pandemonium is ensuing in front of me. <br/>Jeff: While a strong alliance of seven was calling the  shots. And Mike was desperate to join them. <br/>This could be my moment to get off the bottom. <br/>Jeff: At trike, accusations were made. <br/>There's one person running the game right now, and that's  ben. <br/>Our alliance, we sit like the knights of a roundtable. <br/>Jeff: Orders were followed. And Lauren saved her vote for a future tribal council by using  her secret advantage. In the end, Desi became the first member of the jury. Desi, the tribe has spoken. 10 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>My tribal council experience was, again, me not knowing  who's going home. I voted for the person I was supposed to vote for, but Desi went  home, and I’m not happy about because it looks like they're trying to stay  together and vote off the Healers. <br/>Oh, that's pretty. <br/>So at this point, I need to throw the other Healers under  the bus, and suddenly-- not even so suddenly-- throwing names out there, it  could mean I’m here for a few more days. The Healers fell apart when we had the Yawa, and Cole started  telling jesse secrets and then started stealing peanut butter. <br/>Are you kidding me? <br/>What a guy, huh? <br/>At that point, the Healers were done. I have an idol but I don't want to play it so I’m throwing names  out there right now, knowing that Joe and Cole are so hated on this tribe,  that they're going to be one of the two people to go next. <br/>Good morning, Chrissy. <br/>Good morning. <br/>How are you today? <br/>I’m happy every day. It's a new day. <br/>I have the secret  advantage and I played it and I think I played it very well. Nobody caught on to it. I got away with it. My secret advantage is in play, which is super exciting for me  because now I have two votes. <br/>How freaking lucky are we? <br/>You ain't told nobody I have it, have you? <br/>No. <br/>Because I pulled that off really good. I'm not turning my back on you. I hope you don't, either. <br/>No. <br/>When it gets down to seven it will be a hard decision me  and you. <br/>We will talk about it when we get there. <br/>At this point right now the only person who bees about the  secret advantage is ben. And so far, he's not let me down, and I've not let him down, and  keeping him involved in it keeps us, two, together. <br/>It couldn't have worked out any better. <br/>We're good with the sieve? <br/>We're solid, final seven. The only thing I’m worried about is we're going to be screwed  once we get there. <br/>I don't think we'll be  screwed. <br/>You don't think so? <br/>No. You know why? <br/>Why. <br/>Because I have an idol in my pants. <br/>Shut up! <br/>I found it before. I'm really proud of myself so far because I found the idol  underneath the flag. It's mine. It's in my pocket. It will be in my pants going to tribal council. <br/>How did you get it? <br/>Chrissy saw the plate and then I saw the plate, too. Usually if somebody has an idol, you keep your cards close to  your vest, but devin really trusts me, so I had to tell my boy Devon. <br/>No one. <br/>I know. <br/>That's never leaking. <br/>I know that Devon will  never tell anybody that I have an immunity idol. <br/>Thank you, man. I appreciate that. <br/>I’m making him dependent  on me a little bit, and thatdependency is carrying me into the end. <br/>I think this is going to  be the best team "Survivor" has ever seen. <br/>We're a good duo. <br/>And nobody even knows. Captioning funded by cbs. <br/>Jeff: All right, you guysread challenge. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, you'll be divided into two  teams. On my "Go" you'll swim out to a tall ladder, climb  that ladder, leap off the ladder, and retrieve a key underwater. Once you have three keys, you'll open a chest and use the balls  inside to score five baskets. First team to finish wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for. <br/>Jeff: The winning five will be taken on to a luxury yacht. <br/>Okay. <br/>Why you will tour the fujiian islands, dine on sandwiches,  cold beer, red wine, and chocolate cake. <br/>Wait, wait, wait. What's the catch, Jeff? <br/>Jeff: The catch is, losers will go back to camp for more  coconut and rice. <br/>All right. <br/>Jeff: Worth playing for? <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: All right, we'll divide into teams and get started. Let's do a draw. All right, here we go. We have our two teams. For blue it is ben, Devon, and Ashley in the water, along with Ryan  and Lauren. For red, it is Cole, Chrissy, JP in the water, along with Joe  and dr. Mike. Here we go, for reward. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come oguys, come on! <br/>Jeff: It is Ben and Chrissy in the water. <br/>Let's go, Chrissy! <br/>Jeff: Former tribemates on the Heroes. <br/>Good job. <br/>Jeff: Ben first to the platform, making it look easy. Chrissy right on his tail. <br/>Good job, girl! Keep it up. <br/>Jeff: It is a big jump from a tall ladder. <br/>There you go, come opush it! <br/>Come on. <br/>All right, Chrissy! <br/>Good job! <br/>Jeff: Nice execution. Next job is you've got to release that first bowie with the key. Chrissy goes down first. There goes ben. Ben comes up empty-handed. <br/>Come on, ben! <br/>Jeff: Chrissy has hers for red! It is now Chrissy in the lead. Ben still working on that bowie. Now he's got it! <br/>That a boy, ben. <br/>Jeff: Great effort by Chrissy. Got to get all the way up here and get that buoy in the bin. Go, red! Go! <br/>Whoa! <br/> Jeff: It is now Cole in the water. <br/>Let's go, Cole! <br/>Jeff: Cole is ripping through the water for red. Ben lost a lot of time in that first round. <br/>You're almost there! You got this. <br/>Jeff: Cole races up the ladder. Cole jumps. Here comes ben. Go, blue! It is now Ashley in the water. This is what she does for a living, and you can see it. Ashley quickly to the platform. Cole up with the second key, but Ashley is on his tail. <br/>Go, Ashley, go! <br/>Jeff: Ashley making up a lot of time right now. <br/>Let's go, Cole! Get up there! <br/>Jeff: Cole it back. Go! That's two for red, blue with one. <br/>You killed that. <br/>Good job! <br/>Jeff: Ashley up with the second buoy and second key for  blue. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Jeff: Get it in the bin. Go, blue! <br/>Come on, dev. <br/>Jeff: It is Devon in the water now here comes JP. JP does not even come up for air. He jumpedaur the ladder and has stayed under water. This would be a Hero move. And he's got it! JP as fast as anybody in this challenge. <br/>That was epic. Devon up the ladder? <br/>Devon now jumps. JP very fast. Go red. Red doing a nice job in the first stage of this challenge, and  they have a nice lead. Joe and dr. Mike working quickly on the locks for red. Devon has the third key for blue. <br/>Come on, dev. We're still in it! We're still in it, buddy? Let's go! <br/>Jeff: Devon coming back now. Gotta get it in that bin! It is now Ryan and Lauren working on the locks. <br/>We got it. We got it! <br/>We got it, guys! Let's go! <br/>Jeff: Red has their chest open now. Got to get all five balls in. <br/>Oh, wow. That's far. <br/>We've got it! We goff it! <br/>Jeff: They've got it open. Now you're in! <br/>Let's go, let's go! <br/>Jeff: Blue is back in this! Ben already shooting for blue just misses. It is now Joe and ben. Joe scores one for red! Joe looking for number two. Joe scores again for red! <br/>Let's go, baby! <br/>Jeff: Joe, that's three. He has been on fire! Joe looking for number 4 for red. Just misses. Ben goes underhand and it works! Ben with two in a row underhand. <br/>Let's go, buddy, come on! Ben with number three! Suddenly we've got a challenge now. It is three versus three. Ben is going granny style! Old-school midwest! We are tied. Huge reward on the line! Joe connects with number four! It is 4-3. <br/>Right here. <br/>Jeff: Joe looking for that last basket. Joe scores for red! It is over! Big reward! Mike, Joe, JP, Chrissy, Cole-- big win. We're going to bring one of our boats in. They will take you to a luxury yacht, where you will have a nice  afternoon. Well earned. Enjoy. Let's bring in the boat. <br/>It's good to have a good meal and, you know, just to get  the extra energy and have an edge when it comes to individual challenges. But, actually, this reward gives me a window of opportunity to  make moves and completely change the game. <br/>Jeff: All right, Lauren, Ashley, Devon, ben, Ryan, got  nothing for you. Âª âª  I’m on top of the world. <br/>To get a huge meal on a gorgeous yacht while cruising the  fijian islands is absolutely priceless. <br/>Look at that dolphin! <br/>That was incredible! <br/>He, like, did the whole whoop dee do. <br/>Of course I would rather have this reward with just my  alliance, but even though I’m not with my friends, I’m glad I’m here and can  control the conversation. <br/>Look at this! <br/>That's awesome! <br/>This is amazing! <br/>We've got bagels and roast beef and cheese. <br/>I don't even know where  to start. I was so pumped to win this reward, because I’m going to get  some more food, and with immunity right around the corner, I’m going to need  as much energy as I can just to oh, this is so good. I have only lost one challenge my entire "Survivor"  career so far, and with a full belly, I have a better chance than most to win  the next immunity. <br/>We're going in, homey! <br/>It's definitely night noois to be away from camp and have  food and have the option to just kind of hang out. But right now there's 10 players and there's an alliance of  seven. And you have three Healers on the bottom. So I have no control in this game right now. I'm definitely in trouble, but I've always been in trouble, and  somehow, some way, I've stuck around. <br/>Get it, bro. <br/>I’m not getting it. I'm seeing what's in the middle. <br/>He's looking for a clue. <br/>You have to give Joe props. He never stops. <br/>I play the game 24 hours  a day. The idol is underneath the boat! [ laughter ] I came out here to play. I need to go. I like going 100 miles an hour. I don't like slowing down. I'm not going to give up. I've been an aggressive player since day one. I'm going to continue to do that. It will probably cost me the game, but that's me. <br/>Life's pretty good, dude. <br/>Can't complain. <br/>There's the flag right there. <br/>Oh, yeah, there's the flag. <br/>You think they're all going to come out? <br/>[ horn blowing ]. <br/>No! <br/>Is that them? <br/>Oh, my God! It's them! <br/>Oh, my God, it is! <br/>Come on! <br/>Don't even do it! <br/>Oh, here they come! <br/>Dev! <br/>One, two, three! [ laughter ]  That is so good! <br/>I wanted the experience  of being on the yacht, but at the end of the day, you've got to move on. And I now have the opportunity to talk to Ben because I’m trying  to build as many relationships and maximize my advantages that I have. <br/>As long as we stay seven strong, this is not the  worst-case scenario, right. <br/>You want to know what the best-case scenario is? <br/>What. <br/>The idol is in my pants. <br/>You found it? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes! Yes! Dude, no way, you found it! Oh, my God, okay! <br/>Truth is power in this game, and I need to let people know  I’m telling them the truth. <br/>Freaking Ryan has the idol. And I couldn't be more ecstatic at this point because now I know  Cole doesn't have it. Information is key in this game so all this trust getting put  into me is going to help me later on in the game, too. And I’m not going to say anything to anybody about this. But this proves that Ryan is out here to play and win $1  million. So I'll just have to keep an eye on that because right now this  seven has to stick together  And you know you can trust me now. <br/>Yup. We're good. <br/>Yup. <br/>Yup. <br/>Right here. <br/>That thing is disgusting, man. <br/>He's after something. <br/>I'll never give up. I usually find it when I want wh I want to give up. I notice that. That's how it was for my second idol. <br/>Right now, there's a group of seven that are just running  this game, and I’m definitely on the chopping block. Not one person wants to make a move. I've been digging for an idol that probably is not there, but I’m  not going to give up. One thing I do have is, you know, people feel like I am, so I’m going  to start pushing buttons more and I’m going to get enough people so upset at  me that they're like, "Yo, let's just keep this dude around because we  can get rid of him at any point," and at some point I can make a move. <br/>Is Joe out there digging again? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Good for Joe. He's strangely entertaining. Right? Isn't he, like, strangely entertaining? <br/>No. Like, I think there's game play and there's just being...  We can talk about it. The thing is that, like-- we'll talk about it later. <br/>Were you talking about me  We were. <br/>We were talking about you digging down there. <br/>Don't stop talking about me because I got here. You have to keep talking. <br/>We don't have to do anything, Joe. We can do whatever we want. <br/>I know, but Mike knows  the relationship me and him have. He can continue talking. <br/>News flash: Everyone talks about people behind their  backs. You should know that. It's the game, right? <br/>Ashley is getting feisty. I like it. <br/>Well, she needs to because--  I don't need to do  anything you say I need to do. <br/>She's going to make it to the final three being a goat. <br/>You can do your game, and we all have respect for it, but  you need to have the same respect for everyone else. <br/>I’m having respect. And that's what I’m saying in front of you. If I--  How is calling people a goat respectful. Oh, my God, you don't listen to anyone. <br/>I would-- I would use you  as a goat. You're, like, the ideal definition of a goat. <br/>I’m so fed up with Joe's  mouth. I mean, yeah, it's all a game. But, yeah, you're dealing with real individuals and real people  with feelings. <br/>I’m just calling it how  it is. <br/>Just shut up! He's just such a bully, like a bully on a playground, just  trying to do whatever you can and say whatever you can to get under Chrissyy  skin or my skin. <br/>I don't understand the  pont of saying something that like to another human being. <br/>I didn't come here for an  adventure. I didn't come here to make friends. I didn't come here for any of that. I just don't care. <br/>I don't want to be around  you anymore. <br/>I don't know what Joe's  plan it is because he has to know the more he pisses people off the more  they're going to want to get rid of him. I know that's what I will be pitching at the next roundtable  meeting that Joe needs to go before Cole. Joe, shut up! Âª âª  What! <br/>I’m Aligned with Lauren,  but I am going to need to trust someone to come on board with Lauren and I to  help us because thinking more about the fact that Ryan has an idol. I didn't realize-- that's pretty dangerous. <br/>So I’m confident in our final seven, ben. I think we're set. <br/>And that's--  So, we're good. <br/>I know. I'm stoked on that. <br/>But what's your-- what's your plan after, dude? <br/>Realistically, like, I want to sit next to you. <br/>That would be rad. <br/>And that's--  Yeah? <br/>And that's no joke. <br/>I think we can do well  together. <br/>I think we will do well,  dude. I chose Devon because Devon's just got a good soul. He really does. He's got a good heart. I want him to trust me, and I want him for my side. You trust me in this game, we will go far, because there are  things that you're going to find out. <br/>About? <br/>About everyone that is left in the seven. <br/>Oh, like what do you mean, like--  Like secrets. This will either make us or break us. <br/>Okay. <br/>I’m throwing my whole  game out right now. <br/>Okay. <br/>Because I trust you. Ryan has an idol. <br/>Really? <br/>Yes. <br/>Wow. <br/>And that's why I’m telling you this now. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Because you have to trust at least two people. <br/>Okay. <br/>And you I trust fully. <br/>Damn. <br/>Okay? <br/>Damn! I thought I trusted Ryan, man! This game just got real complicated. Ryan's been contingent me that I’m the only one that knows about  this idol. Yet, he's going around to other people telling them the exact  same thing. <br/>He's good. <br/>He is good. <br/>He had me feeling like I was his brother, man. <br/>We were in this game together since day one. And I wanted to go to the final three with Ryan, but I’m going  to move on. I'm going to play this game with ben, and I’m going to have to  make some big moves coming up. I'm locked in with you. <br/>Cool. This game just got fun. <br/>Wow! <br/>And real. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Jeff: All right, you guys ready for today's immunity  challenge? Cole gotta take back necklace. Thank you. Hard to give it up. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to have bars resting on your  shoulders, forcing you into a very uncomfortable squatting position. If, in your attempt to find relief, you go too low, your flag  will pop, or too high, your urn will drop. You're out of the challenge. Last person left squatting wins immunity, safe from the vote. Losers, tribal council where somebody will be the ninth person  votedly out and the second member of our jury. Take your spots. We'll get it on. <br/>Jeff: All right, everybody take your spot on your box. You'll release your poles. Everybody is good. And this challenge is on. Another brand-new "Survivor" torture device that  offers very little wiggle room. You go too low, you're in trouble. If you stand too high, you're in trouble. This one requires a little more finesse. That urn, full of water, hovering above your fire. Ashley is the first to drop and sees how little wiggle room there  is. You can have a spot over here on the bench. Ashley is first out. And we are down to nine people left in this challenge. And you're already in a very uncomfortable position, even  seconds into this challenge. Squatting is never fun. Dr. Mike drops, and we are down to eight. JP moving around a lot, feels very comfortable. How far he can push it. Devon moving around. Joe with a little movement. <br/>Always moving, Jeff. Always moving. <br/>Jeff: Cole trying to find a new spot. And there it is. JP pushes too far. JP is out of the challenge. We are down to seven. <br/>No way. <br/>Jeff: Devon looks down to check out Chrissy's form, and Devon  drops. Next to him, Joe drops. Joe is out. Devon is out. Ashley made one comment about Chrissy's form, and it took out  two guys within seconds. We are down to five. Just like that, Ben drops. Ben is out of the challenge. No shot at immunity. And we are left with four-- Chrissy, Cole, Lauren, and Ryan. You never know when it's your day to step up with a million dollars  on the line and an urn full of water just waiting to put out your fire. Fire, symbolic of what will happen tonight at tribal council. You're never certain at tribal, ever. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy has not changed her approach at all. Cole a little bit of bend, trying to find some relief. Lauren looking straight down. And Ryan all alone on the end, but still in it. How you doing, Ryan? <br/>I’m a Survivor. I'm good. <br/>That a boy, Ryan. <br/>Jeff: That really does sum it up. You're out here. That's most of it. Chrissy cannot take it anymore. You could see her face give out. Chrissy out of the challenge. And we are down to three. <br/>Oh! <br/>Cole, you look good. Everyone's doing good. <br/>You guys are doing great. <br/>Jeff: Ryan cannot hang anymore. Ryan drops out of the challenge, and we are down to two, and  they are side by side-- Cole and Lauren in a showdown. Cole now with some movement. <br/>Your thing looks like it's leaning a little bit. <br/>Jeff: Cole just gave up that necklace, wants to put it  back on as soon as possible. Cole dangerously close to that low level but doesn't seem the  least bit worried as he goes right back up. Stretching it out. Lauren for the first time showing some real movement. <br/>Don't go too high, Lauren. <br/>Lauren, you can't go any higher, okay? <br/>Jeff: Rawren trying to stretch out. Any kind of relief feels so good! Any kind of relief feels so good! <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: And out of nowhere, Cole drops. He's out! Lauren wins individual immunity. <br/>That a girl! <br/>Jeff: Safe tonight at tribal council. <br/>My back's killing me. <br/>Jeff: Great challenge! <br/>Good job, guys. Impressive. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, come on over. [ cheers and applause ]. <br/>That isa girl! <br/>Jeff: Lauren, individual immunity is yours. You are safe tonight at tribal council, cannot be voted out. Sadly for the rest of you, somebody will be the ninth person  voted out, second member of our jury. It will not be you. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Jeff: Congrats. <br/>It's disappointing because I know I had my chance to save  myself today in eye challenge, and I already have a target on my back. But they don't like Joe, so hopefully they'll all take Joe âª  âª  Lauren, great job. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Lauren, killing it today. <br/>You did fab task! <br/>Lauren pulled it out and beat Cole, so couldn't be  happier, you know. It was very important that Cole did not win immunity today  because Cole is the biggest immunity challenge threat here. I need water. <br/>All right, I do, too. I'm sure other people do, too. Anyone need water? <br/>Are you going? <br/>Might as well. <br/>We're getting the main target out, our hard target. But there's a big fear of a hidden immunity idol, and that's why  we can't just place all our votes on one Healer, so we have to split the  votes into a four and three. The fear of the unknown, right, the biggest worry tonight is an  idol. So why don't we just take the fear of the unknown out, and do  four Cole, three Mike-- are you--  What? <br/>Now we're just completely taking Joe off the chopping  block? <br/>Right. <br/>But why Mike and not Joe? <br/>Because this is why. <br/>I’m pissed. Joe, he's like a rat. You lose track of him for one second, and he's off trying to  find another idol. He's off looking for advantages. He's very dangerous in may be ways, and I think we're all just  sick of him, and he needs to go. <br/>Ashley, Ashley--  He's going to spend every second--  We got lucky today. Four for Cole, three for Mike. <br/>You have to get past that right this second. He's not a threat. <br/>Yes, he is. He finds idols nonstop. Somebody else plays an idesol-- if Mike plays an idol, if Mike  plays an idol, he could be back in place. <br/>I agree with that. <br/>Ashley, it's a group decision, four for Cole, three for Mike. No matter what happens, one of those two is going home. <br/>Ben told me to vote Cole because he is a huge physical  threat. I'm getting super annoyed. I don't need to be told what to do right now. I'm going to do everything I can to convince people to vote Joe  because I can't be the only one weighs these options in my head right now. It's gonna kill me not to vote for Joe. I'm, like, putting out other ideas. We're splitting two votes, Cole, Mike. <br/>It's a steam rolling situation. <br/>I want Joe gone. <br/>I want to do Joe. <br/>I do, too. <br/>What does that mean for ben? <br/>Are we all just gog say, "Sorry, ben, we're not with  you on this one?"  Yes, this is not a dictatorship. <br/>Tell me who's everybody voting for so I can vote, you know  what I mean? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Tell me who to vote for. I'm okay doing whatever. I don't care. <br/>Now--  Huh...  Listen. Between you and me... It's Cole. Okay? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Just don't tell Joe. <br/>Yeah. <br/>On faith for tonight's tribal council, if I could believe  ben. But how much can I trust ben? I can't. Every person that I've trusted has betrayed my trust. So I’m not playing their game. I gotta do something to send one of these big threats home. <br/>If they're smart, they'll do Cole, and then me. As far as the split. <br/>Uh-huh. Here's my problem with this whole situation. They're doing this now we have to get Joe out because he's so atrocious,  but they're still planning to vote Cole out. I think there are ways we can turn this upside down. <br/>I know there is. <br/>And get Ben out. It changes everything. <br/>The Hustlers and Heroes' mentality are just playing for  the next tribal council. And it's stupid. So because of that, I’m going to make the world implode by  playing my idol. Eenie-meenie-miney-moe, who am I going to give it to? It might be hydraulic tonight. It's good big or go home time. <br/>What I didn't understand is the logic behind voting for Mike  versus voting for Joe. <br/>I was trying to flush an  idol, if Mike had one, for next one. <br/>I don't want to keep Joe  here with an idol out there. Joe is a huge threat to me. <br/>Right. <br/>I know Cole is a big  physical threat, but I don't think Cole is necessarily going to win every  challenge. <br/>But this--  What if Mike has the idol? I've been voting with Ben since day one, but, apparently, we  cannot ask questions and say, "What is the logic behind voting for dr. Mike?" I am more nervous about Joe finding idols. That's why I think we need to vote for Joe. <br/>I just told Mike to vote  for Cole. Instead of Joe. I'm not trying to be a dictator here, but for my game, I don't  want Joe gone because everyone already can't stand the guy. Unfortunately, some people, they're playing with their heart and  their morals. In "Survivor," heart and morals don't get you a  million dollars. <br/>People are starting to feel a tiny bit steam rolled by  you. <br/>No, no, they're not. You might and Ashley might. It's the safest bet possible. <br/>At this point, it's sort of become ben's way or the  highway. I know there is a game strategy, and the game strategy says get Cole  out first, get Joe out second. But, frankly, there's no bigger strategic threat than Joe. And I know that this is not ben's plan, but I believe that Ashley  feels that way as well. There are a lot of threats left in this game. Now we have to decide what to do. Now we have to decide what to do. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the first member of our jury. <br/>I need to you follow my  lead tonight. Trust me. <br/>Jeff: Desi, voted out at the last tribal council. All right, so, Joe, we start with three tribes, instant  animosity. Then we swap. Now there's some cross-pollination. But now we're 24 days in. You're starting to see the end. So where is the game right now? <br/>Well, from my point of view, the game is lost. You know, I’m not part of the roundtable, and the roundtable  consists of seven. Mike's not part of the roundtable, neither. <br/>I’m the cowt jester. <br/>Jeff: Joe who are the three not in it? <br/>The Healers are the only ones not part of the roundtable  at this moment. <br/>Jeff: Does it seem obvious it's Joe, you, and Mike that  are in trouble? <br/>Yes, I feel like me and Joe are first and foremost on the  chopping block, and I’m not involved in any strategies or there's no game  play going on with me at all. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, there's been a lot going on at tribal  lately with people having it out. What's the vibe at camp right now? <br/>The vibe at camp as of yesterday was extremely difficult. Joe came after Ashley and I and it was just a nonstop barrage of  insults. It went far past game play. <br/>Can I--  Yes, please, Mike. <br/>Honestly, I am disappointed in my tribe. I believe that "Survivor" represents society. We have to play with justifiable moral and ethical codes of  conduct here. So saying Joe is offending us and painting him as a pariah but  then not voting him out is not playing this game of high moral character, and  if that means me speaking up I put a target on my back, fine. But I try to play this game with high moral character. So if Ben is king arthur at the roundtable, I am happy to be the  statue of liberty in america, because america is going to beat in the end. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, is the missing element in Mike's thesis the  word "Justifiable?" meaning, you justify your vote based on game  play, strategy, trust, lack of trust? But all you have to do is say, "Oh, I have my own reasons,  sorry."  I totally agree with what  he's saying if we weren't playing "Survivor."  The fact of the matter, is Lauren, you're going to have to  justify how you--  I don't act that way. <br/>Make Joe into a pariah and then not vote for him. I think you're showing poor moral character. <br/>Do you want to take the shovel and bury yourself. The hole is deeper and deeper and you didn't have to open your  mouth. <br/>Jeff, I think the hardest part about our decision tonight  is how do we vote tonight so that we can be successful at the next tribal. <br/>Who is "We" Chrissy. <br/>The alliance of seven. <br/>Jeff: Cole, when Chrissy was talking and saying,  "Look, it's not just tonight. It's the next one and the next one and from hereon out." is  that a little concerning? <br/>Yeah, I felt like her statement was pretty clear at me. I mean, I’m the person who could be able to screw it up next  time by winning the immunity challenge. <br/>Jeff, these people live in a fantasy world. Nobody is playing the game. Everybody is waiting for the magical seven, and boom, then  everybody starts playing. I don't see that happening. <br/>Maybe we'll change that at some point in time. <br/>It will be four Heroes and three Hustlers. When are people going to realize three does not beat four? <br/>Jeff, you can have all the numbers on your hand and do all  the counting you want, but you cannot calculate relationships, emotion, you  cannot calculate deception. The game happens in every conversation you have. You can't calculate those things. <br/>Jeff: And, ben, with Ashley's comment, she brings it all  back to Mike's original premise offing about a society. It's not just numbers. It's the relationships. <br/>The relationships we build, two, three of those are going  to get you to the end. The thing that puts Joe outside of those relationships is Joe's  mouth. He talks about the roundtable, the king and his knights. But he's the only one living in a fantasy world right now. <br/>Jeff: I’m fascinated with this because Cole has somehow  managed to shrink his body as if to say, "Maybe no one will remember I’m  here."  Thanks, Jeff. It came in pretty grim but who knows, there's so much stirred up  and him opening his mouth and maybe that's good for me. <br/>Jeff: I see heads, Joe has been talking, Mike's been  talking. <br/>That's playing the game of "Survivor"! <br/>Jeff: Ben is talking. It's chaos right now. <br/>Ladies? <br/>Yeah, we're good. <br/>Let's vote. <br/>We're ready. <br/>Mike, are you ready or do you want to keep groog I’m good. <br/>Jeff: All right, it's been a crazy tribal. Let's figure out where it's gog land. It's time to vote. Lauren, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Jeff: If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want  to play it, now would be the time to do so. <br/>I think america's going  to stay one more day. Your tired, your poor, your hungry. I'm playing it for me. <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Mike will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote, ben. Mike. Does not count. Mike. Does not count. Cole. That's one vote ben, one vote Cole. Cole. Two votes Cole. Cole. That's three votes Cole, one vote ben. Cole. Four votes Cole. Ninth person voted out and the second member of our jury, Cole. It's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Cole, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Good luck, guys. Have fun out there. <br/>Jeff: Time for you to go. <br/>Good game, bud. <br/>You, too. <br/>Jeff: Well, alliances are the cornerstone of "Survivor."  but as the number of people dwindle, those on the bottom get desperate, and  it gets more difficult to keep alliances together. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

The alliance of seven seems set in stone. <br/>Joe and Mike are dead men walking. <br/>Jeff: But they start to crumble from within. <br/>This whole trust in the seven alliance is crap. If you're stupid enough to really think it's going to last, then  something's wrong. <br/>We want to talk to you guys. <br/>Stay tuned, I think it's about to get really good. <br/>I was hoping it would be Joe  instead of me. Everyone is gunning for me because they see me as a physical  threat. I'm so grateful and thankful to be here. I played hard and no regrets at all. The highlight of my day was when I got to go fishing and hang  out with Jessica. I hope that continues to be the highlight of my days in the  future.
