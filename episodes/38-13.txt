<br/>Jeff: Welcome to the season finale of "Survivor: Edge  of Extinction." to mark our 19th year and our 38th season, we have a  pretty simple question we wanted to explore: How far would players be willing  to go for a shot to get back in the game, and what might they learn about  themselves in the process? Tonight it will all be revealed. This is the group. They've been living on the Edge of Extinction. Wendy and Keith left the show. That's okay. It's tough out there. The rest of the players are still in it. Tonight they will all battle, and one of them will get back in  the game. That person will join our final five, Gavin, Julie, Lauren, Victoria,  and Devens, who already won his way back in. Three of them will make it to the end with a shot at the $1  million prize and the title of sole Survivor. We are live in los angeles with a packed house, because  wednesday night is "Survivor" night. And once again most of this season "Survivor" the  highest-rated show for young adult, and that's thanks to you guys. All right. Here we go. It is the finale, "Survivor: Edge of Extinction." it  is the finale, "Survivor: Edge of Extinction." after 35 days, only  five remain. Devens, Victoria, Julie, Gavin, and Lauren. But there has never been a season of "Survivor" more  wide open than this one. Because 11 players still have the chance to battle their way  back in from the Edge of Extinction. Who will it be? And who will go on to win the $1 million prize and the tight of  sole Survivor? Come on in, guys. All right. It's time. Come on in. Returning from distinction for the last time. You voted them out, one of them is coming back to either help or  haunt. So let's review. Combined you spent 151 nights on exting shun. Starting with you, Reem, the first the say yes, and you never  raised that sail. You each have deep personal stories of your time on extinction. Sometimes those stories overlap as you worked to survive, but  today you each have one goal, and it is the same -- defeat everybody else to  get back in. You have seen tribal council. This game is alive. You get back in, you got a shot. Here's how your challenge is going to work. You're going to be attached to a rope. On my go you make you way threw a series of rope obstacles and  unclick. You then use piece of rope to build a bridge and cross it. Finally you'll make you way to the end where you will maneuver  two balls through a table maze. First person to land both their balls gets back in this game. You'll put the buff back on and join a very complicated social  matrix that you must quickly integrate. Big, big stakes. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. For a spot back in the game, Survivors ready? Go! First you got to maneuver through this rope maze. Looks easy. It's not. <br/>Come on, guys. Chris throwing himself through it. Eric through, now in the second stage of this rope challenge. Rope manage. Becomes key here. Aurora is through. There's Julia. There goes Joe. Chris is good. <br/>Looking good, Chris. Looking good, David, Joe, Eric, Kelley, everybody. <br/>Jeff: Everybody is through now except Wardog and Ron, the  last two in that first stage. Aubry fighting to squeeze through that rope. <br/>I'm stuck. <br/>Jeff: Reem struggling. <br/>Oh, for the love of God, dude. <br/>Jeff: Reem's favorite word coming into play. <br/>Dude. <br/>Dude. <br/>Jeff: Everybody still in this challenge. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Jeff: It's Aurora through first. She can unclip. <br/>Yes, Aurora! <br/>Jeff: Now you have a lot of knots to untie to get through  this next leg of the challenge. Eric is through, he can unclip. Wentworth is through, Joe is through, David is through. All at once we have five people working on their knots now. <br/>Yes, Kelley! <br/>Don't stop, don't stop. <br/>Jeff: Chris is good. He can unclip. <br/>Good job, Chris. <br/>Jeff: Who will get through these knots the fastest? It's going to be Eric through, Joe right behind him. Now you got to build a rope bridge. <br/>Go, Eric! <br/>Jeff: Here's Wentworth. <br/>Yes, kel. <br/>Jeff: Here comes Aurora. She's in it. Chris is through. You can work this rope bridge anyway you want. You can crawl on it. You can get on your butt. You can lay flat out. You just cannot touch the post on either side. You cannot touch the ground. David is finally through. That's a sprint right there. He's got some time to make up. He's got some time to make up. The lead. Aurora is through first. Aurora working on her knot. <br/>Good job, Aurora. <br/>Jeff: Eric is off, Joe right behind. You're both good. Joe, Eric and Aurora working on their last set of knots holding  them from the table maze. Chris is good. He can start working on his knots. Aurora has her knots untied. Aurora is on the table maze. Eric and Joe have their knots untied. Three people are on the maze right now, Joe, Eric, and Aurora. Chris working on his knots. Chris is good. The table maze the only thing left in this challenge now. You got to get two balls. This is what you fought for all those nights on extinction for  this shot right here. Joe very close with his first ball. Joe in and out. Aurora nice and steady now. <br/>Got it! <br/>Jeff: Aurora has her first ball. <br/>Good job, Aurora. <br/>Jeff: She's just got one more the land to get back in this  game. Here's Wentworth. Aurora is the one to beat right now. Here comes David. This is it. Whatever is in the tank you need it right now. Joe drops his first ball. Chris drops his first ball. <br/>Good job, Chris. Good job, Joe. <br/>Jeff: It is now Chris, Joe, and Aurora with one ball and  only one ball left to get back in this game. Here comes Wardog. Ron's working on his maze now. Joe and Chris side by side on the maze. Both with their second balls. Chris getting closer. Joe now closer. Joe around one of the toughest spots if he can hang on. Chris in the same spot. It is Chris and Joe. Chris in and out. Joe could win it right here. Joe drops. Chris for the win. Chris does it. Chris has earned himself a spot back in the game. <br/>Chris, awesome job, man. <br/>Great job, bro. <br/>Jeff: Chris, 27 nights on extinction earned you a shot at  getting back in and you got it. Come grab your buff. Join the tribe. Congrats. The idea behind extinction was not just a second chance. It was to further explore the social experiment with the  question: What would happen if you took somebody and you sent them off to an  island with no idea how long they were going to be there, no idea what to  expect, what would happen? Reem, you started this. You were the first to say yes and 32 nights out there, you never  once raised that sail and surrendered. What was your darkest moment? <br/>The day I got there. I have never been so cold, so alone, so miserable, and that was  probably my darkest moment, because I didn't know what was going on. But I knew that I wanted a chance. We all came out here for a reason. I came out here to prove something to myself, and I am proud of  myself. And I hope that my family is proud of me. <br/>Of course they are. <br/>Jeff: Joe, every so often players come along that really  connect, especially with kids. You're one of those guys. What part of your life does this game represent? <br/>It's everything, Jeff. Like I'm playing for all those kids from my family, and I feel  like, man I just blew it. I had it right there and I blew it for them, but then I go, no,  you didn't. You were defined of how you bounce back from those loss, how you  rise to the next challenge, and never quitting period. <br/>Jeff: David, what was extinction about for you? <br/>First time I played "Survivor," I pretty much  retreated from life, and playing "Survivor" the first time it gave  me the courage to start living my life and then to start meeting people. And then I came to the Edge of Extinction, and you look over the  edge, and all you see is emptiness, and then you quickly realize, like  everything that's to be found there is made of the stuff you bring up here  and in here, and what I saw is a real value in what I have that isn't there,  isn't here, it's back home, and it's the greatest gift "Survivor"  actually ever gave me, and it's okay they didn't win. <br/>Jeff: Julia? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: You've been smiling almost the entire time. What is it you're feeling? <br/>I am grateful that I got to play this game that I love,  and honestly, that I got to go to the Edge of Extinction. I lost my dad when I was seven to heart disease, and it's been  18 years, and I still was not able to overcome that grief, and it caused me a  lot of burden, and on the Edge of Extinction, I finally was able to realize  how stRong I am and actually believe it. So thank you, surveillance Gods for putting me here in this  moment. I needed it. <br/>Jeff: Eric, you were out there for a long time. <br/>Yes. The first day I woke up on the Edge of Extinction, I thought, I  can't do this for two days, let alone however long I'd have to be out there. But this for me was about my kids. I've got two boys. And I'm the guy that's always going, you can't quit, kid. Pick yourself up. How am I going to say that if I can't do it myself? So I talked myself out of that mast maybe once a day. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: Aubry,where are you right now? Because even watching you in that challenge, not only could I  see physical fatigue, but also mental fatigue. You were struggling just trying to figure out what you've been  doing? <br/>I've been through some very painful losses. I've been right there. I tasted it. I've seen it the morning of day 39 and I still lost it. But "Survivor" is a reminder that it's not that you  lose, but the true character of who you are is what you do with your losses. That's what "Survivor" is about. [applause]  Jeff: Wentworth, what has this "Survivor"  experience been for you? <br/>"Survivor" for me has always been about game. It's not been about the people, and I felt like people looked at  me as their favorite player because I did play them and I was kind of  completely on the bottom at time, but it's about who you are and what you do  with your life. I came in here wanting to win. I've done it all. I've been to the final four. I have nothing left to do but win. I've had the adventure. And I didn't know in the past they was missing something. So I'm very grateful. <br/>Jeff: All right. This is the final push. It's a brand-new game, new complication. Jury, grab your stuff, you're not returning to distinction. [applause] we'll see you at next tribal council. <br/>Good luck, everyone. <br/>Be super proud of yourselves. <br/>Jeff: All right, Devens, Chris, Lauren, Gavin, Julie, Victoria,  day 35, five days left. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. <br/>When Jeff called my name out, honestly, I was in shock. It was my 28th day on the Edge of Extinction. This is the most excited and nervous I've been out here, and now  I am going to do everything in my power to win this game. [cheering and applause]  Jeff: An epic finish to the Edge of Extinction. Chris is back in it, narrowly defeating one of  "Survivor's" most dominant challenge performers, Joe. Come on out, Joe. [cheering and applause] Joe, you're a bit of a  "Survivor" enigma in that your popularity is undeniable, obviously  with kids, but with women, with men, with families. Your statistics are historic. Your tribes have won 24 challenges. You've won seven individual. That's 31 wins. And yet it is all those qualities of likability and strength in  challenges that your own tribe voted you out. So can a guy like you, can a player like you win this game? <br/>Man, I think it is very, very, very, very hard for a  player like me to win this game, but there's stale chance. It's very hard, but I think, you know, you can. But it's really hard. <br/>Jeff: Does that mean you're promising to continue to come  back until you win? [cheering and applause] come on! <br/>Well, of course, I think I just want to hang up the hat,  but I don't want to sell the farm. You know, I just need...  Jeff: Give me a regulars,just give me a rest. <br/>I appreciate everything so much, and "Survivor"  has taught me so much about, you know, appreciating life that much more, but  I have a feeling I'll be back. <br/>Jeff: Okay. Well, I just want to say, were were -- before we go to break. I have a theory. Your achilles' heel, the hair. It's the weight distribution. <br/>What? <br/>Jeff: The balance. <br/>I'm like sampson. <br/>Jeff: The guy who cuts my hair is here if you want to cut  it off. <br/>Wait, wait, wait, you really think this is it? <br/>Jeff: I don't know. Should we cut it or keep it? <br/>If I become normal --. <br/>Jeff: Cut it or keep it? <br/>Really, this is it? <br/>Jeff: "Survivor: Edge of Extinction" finale  continues right after this. Keep the hair. Keep it. You should keep it. You want to cut it? I'll cut it. Let's cut it. <br/>Congratulations. Thank you so much. <br/>Good job, dude. <br/>Nice to meet you. <br/>Pleasure. I'm so happy that I'm in this game again, but getting back in  and kicking it back in just like that, it's not easy. It will take a little bit of getting used to. So sorry if I'm a little out of it. <br/>New york reacclimate. <br/>I'm not as mentally there as I was in the beginning and  I'm not as physically there at all, but I do have information. If anyone wants to come talk to me, come talk to me. I have to downplay my game. I'm not perceived as too big of a threat. Maybe I can find someone who I can trust, at least to get to the  next vote. Whatever happens happens. And if I'm gone tomorrow night because they don't want to work  with me, whatever, I just went basically from last place to the finale. So I'm good with it, you know. <br/>Chris is given us a soft quit, like if I go home tomorrow,  I'm cool. That's ridiculous. Nobody sits on Edge of Extinction for almost a month to finally  win their way back in the game to be like, if I go, I go. If anyone is buying that, they're insane. <br/>He has not given up. There's no way. <br/>I don't know him at all. <br/>He knows a lot. <br/>Chris is not good for my game. I don't know him at all, but there are two people on this tribe  that do know him, so for them Chris becomes an option that wasn't here  before. <br/>I hope that your head's a little more in the game than  you're letting on. <br/>I want to get to the end. I want us to be final four. <br/>I'm this close to the end, and now there is this big  curveball of, hey, it's my buddy, who I betrayed. I just got to be careful that I don't end up blowing this game  that I've worked so hard for. <br/>I'm not going to write your name down, I promise. I've been down that road. If you stab me in the back, I get it. <br/>By the way, is your idol real or fake? <br/>I got to know? Is it real or fake? <br/>We're good. I promise, we're good. It's real. <br/>Okay. So --  I'm playing it. If I don't win tomorrow, I'm definitely playing it. <br/>We've got stick together at this point. We're finishing what we started. <br/>I hope you didn't spend 28 days just planning revenge. <br/>Chris and I have a relationship. We were broken down together on the Edge of Extinction. It's been a long time. He's had a lot of time to think about the game. I'm the only person who really betrayed and backstabbed him in  this game. I'm sure he hasn't forgotten that. <br/>I know from a jury standpoint the players that are going  to have respect on the jury are ones that like made moves. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And Wentworth wants you to do well. And this is from Wentworth, you have to play your idol correctly  for someone or for someone else to have a big enough move. <br/>I knew you knew. I knew whoever came back from extinction would know I had an  idol. But I don't know what my read is on Chris yet. He's trying to get locked in in some sort of alliance that will  take him further in this game, which is really the only thing he can do. It's not so much if I can trust him. It's does he have better options. It's like dating someone. You know? I show up at a bar with my boyfriend. I see ryan reynolds. You shouldn't trust me anymore. I'm going to date ryan reynolds if I have the chance. You have to make sure that you are their best option if you're  going to trust anyone, you should trust me because I can make sure that no  votes go on you. But you can tell them what I have, and it loses all its power,  and I'm willing to work with you. Right now I think that I am his best option, which leads me to  trust him. Whether or not it's rightfully placed trust will be what we'll  see shortly. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. First things first. Devens, take back the immunity necklace. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to race through a series of  obstacles. You'll then cross the balance beam, collecting a bag along the  way. You'll use the tielts inside to solve a combination lock. You'll use those pieces to solve a circular puzzle. First to finish wins immunity, safe from the vote, guaranteed a  one in five shot at getting to the end. Losers tribal council where somebody will be voted out and with  extinction no longer an option, it is do-or-die from here on out. In addition, you're playing for reward. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: First to finish, steak. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>What? <br/>Jeff: Chocolate cake for dessert. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Big steak. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. <br/>Oh. My. God. <br/>Jeff: For immunity and reward, Survivors ready? Go! Launch yourself through it. That's what Devens does out of the gate. He's through. Lauren is through. Chris is through. Chris is whipping through this challenge. Chris drops. He's got to go back. Julie struggling to get up and over. These are high. Now you've got to get across the beam with the bag. Devens on the beam now working on that bag of tiles. Chris now working on his bag. Devens has his. Start working on the combination lock. Chris is good. Lauren is good. Julie is good. She's across. Victoria is across. Gavin is now across. Everybody now working on their combination. Out of nowhere Victoria with her first try gets it. Now it's Victoria in the lead. Victoria now can start working on that puzzle. Devens has his. He can start working. Julie has hers. Lauren has hers. Gavin has his. It is now Chris in dead last and all alone trying to solve that  combo. Victoria with her first couple of pieces. Devens has a piece. Julie's got one. Lauren with a piece. Everybody fighting in this challenge now. Chris finally opens his combination lock. Chris has got a lot of time to make up. It is Julie with Lauren right in there. Victoria is right in there, too. Devens trying to stay in it. Chris and Gavin nowhere close. <br/>Puzzles aren't my thing. <br/>Jeff: Julie with another piece. <br/>Come on, Julie. <br/>Jeff: Julie is not waiting on anybody. She can taste it, a spot in the final five. Only a few pieces left. <br/>Come on, Julie. <br/>Julie, my girl. <br/>They weren't rooting for you last time when they were  going to split the vote, were they? <br/>Sorry, Devens. I want the win something. <br/>Jeff: Julie down to her last piece if she can get it in  without that puzzle falling apart. Immunity is hers for the second time. The risk now is that the entire puzzle collapses. Julie trying the force it in. <br/>Watch out for that middle piece. Julie feeling the panic. <br/>Put your left hand lower. There you go. Chris is literally talking her through it. Very unusual situation. Right there. <br/>Chris, man. I don't know what you're doing. <br/>You got this. <br/>Can she get it to fit this time? For the win? <br/>Jeff? Looks good to me. <br/>Jeff: Julie's got it! Julie wins individual immunity, safe at the final five. <br/>Good job, Julie. <br/>Oh, my God. Good job. <br/>Good job. <br/>You did great. <br/>Jeff: Julie, come on over. Your second individual immunity win. Back at camp you're going to have steak. Choose one person that will enjoy the same meal with you. <br/>There's one person out here who has not had the merge  feast and who has not had one reward for 35 days she's eaten coconut and  rice. Chris, will you join me? <br/>Come on over, Chris? <br/>Thank you so much, Julie. <br/>Jeff: You have one more person to bring with you. <br/>I'm going to go with Lauren. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, come on over. Devens drops his head. <br/>I've gone to bat for jewel lay number of times. She knows that. She's never gone to bat for me. Lauren and her have had more rewards than anyone out here, so  I'm disappointed. <br/>Jeff: Victoria, Gavin, Devens, got nothing for you. See you tonight at tribal where somebody will be voted out. <br/>I didn't win the immunity idol imand it sucks, but why the  heck was Chris helping Julie? You're supposed to be being loyal to me and working together,  and that blew my mind. I want to trust him, and I kind of do trust him, but I'm very  wary. <br/>Holy crap. <br/>Everyone just sit down. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I was hoping that there would be a reward with the  challenge today, and I knew if I won that Chris would be my number-one pick. Here's the thing, you will get full of food. I wanted to bring Chris in to ensure that Devens isn't sitting  in the final three. I need Rick to be out of this game. <br/>The thing I really want the relay to you is Devens. He's tried four tribal councils to get him out. We're not going to have another chance. <br/>I want the try to at least feel him out, see if his idol  is real or fake. Plaintiff's no way he shows that idol if it's real. <br/>At the last tribal council, Devens pulled out an immunity  idol and I'm praying that it's fake. But if it's real, then I need a plan "B."  If he plays the idol tonight, then the votes get put on  somebody else. <br/>The two biggest threats from the standpoint of the jury  are Rick Devens and Victoria. Splits the votes between Victoria and Devens. <br/>It has been, I don't even though, 20 days and counting  that I have been trying to get out ricardo francis. -- Rick Devens. Hopefully tonight is the night. I really like this back-up vote scenario. Victoria and I are very close, but it's f what Chris is saying  is true, I have no intention of sitting next to Victoria at the end. <br/>He can't be that much of an idiot. <br/>I don't know, it's Julie. <br/>The last challenge is going to be very physical and he  just ate. My suggestion is we take out Chris today. Now hear me out, because what if they're truly working together? If they're smart, they don't work with us. They have a better chance of beating Chris in the end than one  of us. If Julie, Lauren, and Chris are now working together, and we  take out Devens tonight, that means that a final five, those three have  decision making power, leaving me and Gavin on the outs, and so as much as I still  don't want to go up against Devens in a final three with him, as of right  now, I don't think either him or me make it to final three if we don't work  together tonight. <br/>The idea was to split between you and Chris today if you  both lost. That's fairly obvious. <br/>Right. <br/>My fear is that they're working together, right. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>And he just like totally stopped the puzzle to help her. <br/>I truly don't know who Chris is trying to work with. It may be anyone. <br/>I don't know. I feel like he's telling us all what we want the hear a little  bit. I don't know if he wants to work with me or not. <br/>We could just vote for Chris? <br/>The last thing I want to do is betray Chris again, but  what they're pitching makes sense. Because I'm worried that Chris is playing much harder than he  appears and that he is here to get some revenge and try the win the game and  take me out in the process. I'm totally open to everything, including voting Chris out. <br/>I'm playing my idol tonight to matter what. But I just got to be careful that I'm working with the right  person. So I need to make sure that Chris is playing with me and not  against me. <br/>How was lunch? Productive? <br/>Lunch was good, man. Before game talk, I just continued to think about the first time  you went against me and voted me out. I felt betrayed. But you were like the next person voted out. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And on the edge, we made amends, and we did it in a very  genuine and real way. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And that relationship is going to get us to the end. If it's not me who gets to the end, I will fight and die for Rick  Devens to win this game. <br/>That's hard to believe. <br/>I am completely loyal to you. What else do I have to do for you to know that I promise? <br/>What did you get in your bag today? I know you got something. Because I got something when I came back. <br/>This morning I was looking through my bag, reached in, and  pulled out an envelope, and opened it up, the same idol that David and Devens  used earlier in the game. <br/>Holy cow. <br/>You have earned your way back in. Staying in may not be as easy. This may help. You must give one half of this immunity idol to another player. If you are both still in the game after the next tribal council,  these two pieces when used together become one idol with full power. <br/>It's the exact same thing. <br/>I am giving half the idol to you. Here's how you know you can trust me. <br/>You need me here or you lose the idol. <br/>Exactly. <br/>Chris gave me half of his idol. And that is a guarantee that I can trust him tonight, because he  doesn't want to lose that idol. But I don't think for a second he thinks he can win against me. If he doesn't get me out. But if I work with Gavin and Victoria, and that's something I  won't have to worry about. Putting my game on the line for this personal relationship may  come back the bite me. But if it's real, it can really pay off. <br/>If the plan is what me, Lauren, and Julie secured at the  reward, then vick's going home. <br/>I'm just afraid they're going to split it between the two  of us. You feel comfortable with it? You're the one that's on the line. <br/>When I got voted out first time, I got blindsided. I am not going to let that happen again. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. The only way to ensure I'm 100% safe is if I can get Lauren to  play her idol for me. <br/>Are you playing me? <br/>No. I promise. <br/>You promise? <br/>100%. We are voting Rick. Do you think Rick's idol is real? <br/>No. If he plays his idol. I'll play my idol for you. <br/>You promise? <br/>100%. <br/>I do not want to go home. But I'm putting a lot of faith in a lot of people, and that is  scary. If Lauren goes against me, I might be screwed. It's a risky move, but it's the only play that I got to get me  to tomorrow. This is everything tonight. <br/>Jeff: Chris, go ahead and grab your torch. Dip it in and get fire. You are back in the game. We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Chris, let's start with you. Past 36 hours have been big. You get back in the game. What's the feeling the second time? <br/>It's like a roller coaster. And I'm thrust into this new world that I haven't been part of  for the last 28 days. Like I'm figuring out how to play this game all over again, and  it's scary. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, could you feel that, that it was like he got  on to the freeway all of a sudden and cars are just whizzing past? <br/>Yeah, but did I think Chris kind of jumped into what he  considered to be his role. He said, I have a lot of information, and, you know, I'm here if  you want it. <br/>Jeff: Julie, another individual immunity win. The other big part was reward. And you chose Chris and Lauren. <br/>I picked Chris right away. He hasn't eaten in 36 days. But then you said to pick somebody else, and I decided to go  with Lauren. <br/>Jeff: So Devens, you were pretty emotional today when you weren't  picked  I was disappointed obviously. You know, numerous times this season I have stepped up to bat  for Julie. I thought she might on a human level take me for the food. It's, you know... I don't want my firefighter friends the make  it's, you know... I don't want my firefighter friends the make fun of me. Being on the bottom for as long as I have and being told every  day, like, well you need to gosh, you're public enemy number one, it breaks  you down after a while. <br/>Jeff: Victoria, the other person she chose was Chris. You could make an argument he's the easy vote. <br/>Yeah, you could definitely make that case. But I think there is somebody else that we already all agreed  on, so why rock the boat? <br/>Nothing new. I'm public enemy number one and I'm on the bottom. <br/>Jeff: Chris, is there a difference between the easy vote  and the right vote? <br/>If every single player up here was on a level playing  field, then I'd obviously be the person to get out. But there's always someone at the top, and there's always  someone at the bottom. And I'm not going to tell you how to play your game. I'm going to give you information the make decisions. <br/>Jeff: So Lauren, it's a little bit like Chris is taking on  the role of messenger, and he's hoping that the vote will just take place and  nobody will ever look back and say, wait a second, what about the messenger? <br/>I think you have to take what he says kind of with a grain  of salt, because there is no way that he's thinking, I'm going to give them  abslultly everything and hope that that's fine, because if you give us  everything, why would we want the keep you? <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Lauren, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. The anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. <br/>Jeff. I got something I would like the play. <br/>Jeff: You playing this for yourself? <br/>For myself, yeah, absolutely. <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Devens will not count. <br/>Jeff? It's all broken since I've had it since like day the work but I  would like the play this for Chris. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol, and although it's  broken, this idol is also real. Any votes cast for Chris will not count. I'll read the votes. First volt Devens. Does not count. Devens. Does not count. Devens. Does not count. Chris. Does not count. Victoria. That's one vote Victoria. <br/>Oh. <br/>Jeff: 15th person voted out and the 11th member of our  jury, Victoria, you need to bring me your torch. Victoria, the tribe has spoken. <br/>I'm not sure which of you did it, Devens, good play. Gavin, I'll vote for you, man. <br/>Jeff: Well, you've made it to the final five. I'll see you tomorrow for your next community challenge. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>In the middle of the night I got up, because we all knew  that after I played my idol last night there was a good chance there would be  another idol planted somewhere around camp. There's no doubt I'm target number one, so I just knew I had to  find it before anyone else. But first, I took two fake idols that I made six days ago,  knowing that I was in trouble, and I put them in the exact same cross with  the instruction from the real idol applied at tribal, and I hit them. Hopefully this will throw them off the trabal of the real idol  and give mae chance to find it first. <br/>Hi, Rick. <br/>Hi, Julie. <br/>What are you doing? <br/>What do you think? <br/>And then Chris and Julie walked up, and I'm like, it's go  time. <br/>I search, I search, Julie starts following me, searching  in fRont of me. But then there it is, right in the crack of a bentover broken  tree, the idol. Oh. That's in the good news for anybody but me. Oh, my goodness. I found it. I found the idol. And now they have no chance to vote me out. Yes! Holy crap. This means safety tonight. I'm going to make final four. I'm on on the of the world right now. <br/>Good job, buddy. <br/>Congratulation. You have a full-blown immunity idol. <br/>So do I. <br/>We did it. <br/>I gave Rick half the Edge of Extinction. It was a big risk, so when Rick gives me that piece of the idol  back, I was so relieved, because he could have betrayed me. <br/>It's done. We cannot turn on each other now if we wanted to. <br/>I'm in a great spot. My game and Rick's game are intertwined and we're going to the  final four together. So I picked the right person to trust. <br/>He has it. We just uh is a him find one. <br/>I can in the believed I played my one for Chris last  night. I am so stupid. <br/>We're not giving up. <br/>We need to find one. <br/>So Rick finds an immunity idol. But at last night's tribal council, two idols were played, so it  only makes sense to me that if two idols were played, two idols would be  there to be found today. <br/>Lauren! Lauren! Lauren! <br/>No way. No freakin' way. <br/>Lauren! <br/>I think they just found my fake. <br/>I am so excited. I found a hidden immunity idol. So I'm safe. And I can't wait to play it tonight. It's the last thing on my "Survivor" bucket list. <br/>This game is not over. <br/>So Julie finds the second hidden immunity idol, and in my  head I'm thinking, I am screwed. The only thing that I can do now is to try to win immunity, but  as I'm going back the camp, all of a sudden I come across a little scroll  that has been rolled up in a tree that I have looked in 50 times. <br/>Congratulations. You have found a hidden immunity idol. It is in the tree above your shelter. <br/>Oh, my God. Okay. <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. <br/>She found my fake. <br/>It's a hidden immunity idol. It's like the Survivor Gods granted me, you know what, Lauren,  you were an idiot last night. Let's try again this night. <br/>Jeff: Come on up, guys. First look at what you'll be running today. <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, boy. <br/>Wow. That's amazing. <br/>Amazing. Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Devens, a little daunting? <br/>Yeah, man. We're a long way up, and there's a lot going on. <br/>Jeff: Can we get to it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge you'll race across six  different obstacles over the ocean, collecting bags of puzzle pieces as you  go. Once you have all the piece, you'll use them to solve a puzzle. First to finish guaranteed a spot in the final four, biggest  stakes so far this season. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. Let's do it. All right. Here we go. Survivors ready? Go! Six different obstacles you have to cross. One at a time. Grabbing puzzle pieces as you go. Devens on the swing steps. Gavin goes to the disk bridge. Julie at the bamboo crawl. Chris going to take on the two-line bridge. Lauren on the beam and ladder. Chris making quick work of first one. So is Devens. Get that bag on the table. Get back out there. Gavin struggling on the disk bridge. That's a tough one. Julie is back with hers. Lauren gets across. Chris is now on the ba-boom crawl. It's hard on the knees. You wouldn't know it from watching it. Chris is bag with his second bag. Everybody has their first bag. Chris now with his second. Devens is across. Julie's across the swing step. Devens has his second bag. Julie has her second. Chris now on the swing step. Here's Gavin with his second bag. Chris is back now with his third bag. Lauren on the disk bridge. It's a tough one. Gavin and devon both at the balance beam. Who will get that bag untied first. They're both fighting for it. Gaffen gets it. Gavin coming back now with his third bag. Lauren finally across. She's got her second. Devens sliding across that beam now. Losing some time. Julie's got her third bag. Chris hanging on. He comes across the beam bridge. Devens is across the balance beam. He's got his third bag. Devens heading back out. Chris back with his fourth. Here comes Gaving, hanging on with a big smile. This is "Survivor" right here. Lauren on the swing steps. She's across. She's taking the Devens approach now, and that's going to slow Chris  down. Chris cannot pass Julie. Gavin trying to make up time step, and still smiling on day 37. Gavin has his fifth bag. Gavin has one more bag out there. Chris got one bag left. Lauren with her fourth. It's going to be Gavin to get back first with all his bags. Gavin can start working on the puzzle. Chris has all six. He can start on the puzzle. It is Chris and Gavin already at work untying all of their  puzzle pieces. They're trying the capitalize on this early lead. Julie is across with her sixth bag. She can start on the puzzle. Devens is across. Devens can start working on the puzzle. Lauren has her sixth and final bag. Everybody is on the puzzle now. 37 days brings us to this: Chris off to fast start. Gaffen off to a fast start. Both Chris and Gavin are using that time advantage well. Devens, Lauren, and Julia, can they catch Chris and Gavin? Gavin is on fire one piece after another. Everybody frantically working on this puzzle. Devens staying in this. You can hit a roadblock in this puzzle. Just because somebody's in the lead doesn't mean they'll win it. Lauren has a little something going. Chris is dead in the water. He's been in the same spot. Gavin inching his way toward the final four. Piece by piece. Devens trying to catch Gavin. Got to keep moving. Devens with another piece. And another piece for Devens. It's now Gavin and Devens both making a run at. This Julie trying the stay in it. Devens with another big piece. Devens puzzle now coming together. It is Gavin on one end. Devens on the other. Day 37. Fighting for a spot in the final four. Gavin feeling the panic now, the pressure. Gavin places another piece. He's racing now to place pieces. What a comeback this would be for jean-claude "Baby  doc" duvalier down to handful of pieces. Gavin still digging to stay in it. Devens can steal it. Victory is close. Devens two pieces left. <br/>Jeff! <br/>Jeff: Devens thinks he has it. And he does. Devens wins individual immunity, guaranteed a spot at the final  four. What a comeback. Devens, come on over. Individual immunity again is yours. Safe tonight. Guaranteed a spot in the final four. As for the rest of you. I know it's disappointing. Somebody going home tonight. Grab your stuff, head out. See you tonight at tribal council. Congrats. <br/>Thanks, man. <br/>Thanks, guys. <br/>I appreciate it. I thought I was going to be the puzzle man today. <br/>I can't believe it. I won immunity again. They can't get rid of me. They've been trying so hard to get rid of me, and now I'm going  to the final four. I'm at a point now where I see the $1 million. <br/>I'm going to go to the porch and recollect for a few. <br/>At this point Chris has an idol tonight, so he's not going  anywhere. Julie and Lauren both think they're safe, but they're two idols  are both fake some the only person here who feels like they're in trouble is Gavin. Now I have options. I have an idol that I found this morning, and I'm going to try  to use it tonight to secure my place in the final three. <br/>Well, you're double safe. <br/>Double safe. And I can't use it past tonight. <br/>Well, that's what I was going to say is like, I don't know  what you plan on doing with that idol, but I would be endebted to you. <br/>Honestly, what I want is pretty steep. But if you won tomorrow, I wouldn't want to be in the fire  making challenge. Like if you really promise me that, guarantee I'd play the idol  on you tonight. <br/>Devens approached me with this idea saying, what if he  saves me tonight, he scratches my back and then in return if I win the  challenge tomorrow, I take him to the final three. An I'm just thinking, if I go to the end with Devens, he's  probably going to beat me. He's played a great game. But I'd be stupid to say no. If our trust is going to be forged tonight. <br/>You promise if you win, you take me with you? <br/>I don't think I have another option honestly. <br/>Seriously? <br/>Yes. <br/>It's done. I'm playing it for you. <br/>Right. <br/>I know a promise is a promise. But if I'm still here tomorrow. I might have to go against my word, because by God I came out  here not to make promises. I came out here to win this game. <br/>He's not going to play his idol on Chris because that  means he might have to face Chris in the fire making challenge. <br/>I would say Chris. <br/>We three have to stick together. <br/>Oh yeah,. <br/>I'm super excited. I have an idol. That keeps me safe. And along with Gavin and Lauren, we have the numbers to vote out  Chris. He made a lot of friends over there on the Edge of Extinction. So he could easily win jury votes. Also, if he has to go tonight...  You don't think Chris has anything he can play tonight, do  you? <br/>No, I don't. I think we're fine. <br/>I'm totally good with voting out Chris. We wholeheartedly need him gone tonight, but even though I have  an immunity idol, I'm worried. Because this morning Julie and Rick found idols, too. It's so hard for me to believe that there were three idols on  this beach. It makes me think one of them could be fake. And if it's mine, then I could be gone. So I need to make sure that I get as few votes as possible. <br/>Here's my thing. I think he'll take Julie to the end. And that's a space that I want. And I think that like me and you and Gavin could get on board to  take out Julie. <br/>So Lauren pitches to me that we vote Julie tonight. But I think it's a smoke screen. I think I'm the real target, but I have an idol, so I'm thinking  it's going to be either Lauren or Julie. Julie has proven time and time again that she's a social threat. She has friends from Kama on the jury. Also, she's won two immunity challenges. So she is dangerous. If any of us win tomorrow and gets immunity, I have a better  shot at beating Devens at fire than she does. <br/>Exactly. Is that something you want to do? <br/>With Julie and Lauren both having fake idols, Devens and I  can choose who is going home, but we have to be on the same page. <br/>You and me, we have to figure out who we want to send  home. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's Lauren or Julie. <br/>I think Lauren of those three definitely played the most  strategic game. Lauren is going to think she's safe. <br/>Everybody is going to think they're safe tonight. This is good to be a fun night. <br/>Chris has got an idol. I've got an idol. So we have total control of the vote tonight. Lauren has been on the right side of all these different votes  that I've been on the wRong side of, and that makes me look bad, but Julie  could also be trouble, because there's going to be a lot of Kama people in  that jury, so we got to make a decision, but either way, all five people  going to tribal council think they're safe tonight. It's going to be fun. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. All right. Let's start with today's challenge. Devens, your fourth individual immunity win. Is part of that drive coming from the fact that you have truly  felt like you were going home if you didn't win? <br/>Yeah, I really think so. When your back is up against the wall, you just have everything  to lose, and I feel like I get super focused in on what I'm doing, and it's  driven me so far. I'm surprised by it, but I'm happy about it. <br/>Jeff: Chris, when you get back the camp, once again Devens  is safe. Was that the conversation? Now what? <br/>Yeah. I needed to win today. Not having that necklace right now really made me nervous, so I  had to trust that the people and the relationships that I've formed since  being back in this game, they're going to pay off, and I've had to use what  little cards I have to plead my case. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, what do you make about Chris's answer. That seamed to pique your interest. <br/>Chris is saying, if doesn't win, I can beat him in fire  making. But what happens if wins his fifth immunity and I'm in the fire  making challenge against Chris? <br/>Julie, does Chris's logic make sense? If Devens is seen as the number one, then you should keep  somebody who has a chance to beat the number one? <br/>I agree with Lauren, there are a lot of ifs that have to  happen, and it could be me in a fire her making change. Like Lauren, I don't want to sit next to Chris. There are too many unknowns. <br/>Last tribal I made a gamble. And I said, if Lauren is telling me the truth, then I'm good. So, yeah, there's a lot of ifs out there. <br/>?Oo Chris, is there trust between you and Lauren based on  the idol play, or is that game play and that's done now? <br/>It was game play at that time. Now whether or not she was telling me the truth because she wanted  to help me or because she wanted to boost her resume, I don't know. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, it sound like Chris was frustrated with you,  and yet you played you idol for him. <br/>I think I have trust with Chris, but a I can't really tell  if he thinks he has trust with me, which is frustrating because trust should  work both ways. But I think that the people that I have a plan with tonight know  where my allegiance lies. <br/>If they think that taking me out they have a better shot  at beating Rick, then that's their play. <br/>Jeff: What's that like, Devens, to be the center of  everything for several tribals in a row. <br/>I would have thought it would be awesome, but it's old  now. I feel like people get so laser focused on me that they let the  rest of the game go by. <br/>Jeff: Gavin, what's your point of view? <br/>I'm willing to go against the best of them. I have I have a proven track record in immunity challenges so  far, so maybe next one I can win and then we can decide as a group who we  want to put in that fire-making challenge. <br/>Jeff: So your pitch is that you could win the next  challenge, therefore, opening the door to get rid of whoever you want? <br/>Right. I have won two and I was close to winning three today. That would have tied me and Devens. He did get the upper hand on me today, but that doesn't mean  that's going to be the same case for tomorrow. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Julie, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol, tonight is the last night  you can play it. <br/>Well, Jeff, just in case, I found a little something. I don't think it's me tonight, but I'd like the play it for  myself. <br/>Jeff: This idol is fake. <br/>[laughter]  Jeff: Any votes cast for Julie will still count. <br/>What? Jeff. <br/>So here's hoping this one is real. <br/>Jeff: Thank you. <br/>Thank you. I'm going the play it for myself. <br/>Jeff: This idol is fake. <br/>Wow. <br/>That's amazing. <br/>Jeff: Any votes cast for Lauren will still count. <br/>That's crazy. <br/>I'll give it a shot, Jeff. <br/>That's amazing. <br/>Unbelievable. <br/>I will play this idol for Gavin. <br/>Dude. Are you serious, man? <br/>I love you, bro. <br/>Jeff: This idol is real. Any votes cast for Gavin will not count. <br/>Well, hate the poop on everyone's parade, but I might just  have to play this one, as well. I'm playing it for myself. <br/>Jeff: This idol is also real. Any votes cast for Chris will not count. Anybody else? [laughter] I'll read the votes. First vote, Chris. Does not count. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: Chris. Does not count. Chris. Does not count. Lauren. One vote Lauren. One vote left. 16th person volted out and the 12th member of our jury. Lauren, you need to bring me your torch. <br/>That was really well played, Rick. <br/>Jeff: Lauren. The tribe has spoken. <br/>Thank you. Bye, guys. Seriously, good luck. <br/>Bye, Lauren. <br/>Jeff: You've made it to the final four. Tomorrow you'll compete in your final immunity challenge. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. Take back the immunity necklace. For the fourth time. Once again immunity is up back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to negotiate a rocking  walkway while attempting to balance blocks on a wobbly ledge. First person to stack all their blocks spelling "Final  three" wins immunity, guaranteed a spot at the final tribal council  where you will get a chance to plead your case about why you deserve the  title of sole Survivor and the million dollar prize. The single biggest challenge of the season. Let's draw for spots. We'll get started. Here we go. For immunity and a spot at the final tribal council, Survivors  ready? Go! Everybody out quickly. That first block is easy. You get it down, get back. Although I say that and Gavin drops and Devens drops. Two drops on the first and easiest part of this challenge. That speaks to the learning curve. Julie has her first. Coming back with her second. Chris has his second block. Devens reaching for his second block. Got to get behind the line. Gavin now back again with his first block. Julie with her third. Devens places his second. Chris still has two. Chris moving very slowly. Devens has slowed down now, trying figure this out. Everybody moving nice and slow now, trying to figure out where  that tipping point is. And defer deaf just found it. Gavin drops again. Everybody now chasing Julie and simultaneously hoping Julie will  drop. Chris playing his own game now. Not worried about Julie. Just slowly building his stack with his third. Julie has her fourth. Gavin drops. He's got to start again. It is Julie with four. Chris with three. Devens still wobbly down on the end with his first. Julie reaches for that fifth block. She's been perfect this this challenge. Chris now with three. Gavin at one. Devens at one. Julie in the lead with four. Coming back with her fifth. And Julie drops everything. Has to start over. That's how fast it can change. It is now Chris in the lead with three. This is why you keep fighting. Anybody can drop. As Gavin just did. Has to go back again. Chris places his fourth block. Chris is really slow now. He's got a lead. He doesn't want to lose it, which opens the door for Devens to  try to catch him. Devens drops, loses everything. It's now Chris and Gavin drops. He's out again. Chris has been very consistent for a long time. Julia moving a lot faster than Chris trying to make up time. Chris remains slow and steady. Chris now all alone in the lead. Coming back with his fifth block. If he can maintain this pace, and that balance, he'll be going  to the final three. Gavin trying to get back in it with his third. Julie not giving up. She's quickly trying to get back in this. Devens down on the end with one block, and that just drops. Devens has had no success in this challenge at all. It will take a mistake from Chris for anybody else to have a  shot. And his closest competitor, Gavin just dropped. Devens now picking up the pace. Devens places his third. Julie coming out with her third, hoping for a disaster for Chris. He's reaching now to place that sixth and final block. Nice touch. Now Chris just has to get back to the finish. Both feet across the blue. Gavin drops. He's got to start again. Julie back in it with her fourth block. Devens drops. Devens has to start again. This would be Chris's first individual immunity win, and what a  time for it to come. Devens drops again. Panic setting in now. Julie with her fifth block. Julie's going to have to make a decision. Does she race and try the catch Chris or hope for him to drop. Chris is just a few steps away. Got to get both feet over the blue. Chris at six, Julie at five. Chris inching those feet back. Chris is either going to drop or going to win. Julie drops. Chris has one foot in the blue. The left foot, the only thing standing between Chris and a spot  in the final three. Chris has it! Chris wins individual immunity, guaranteeing himself a spot at  the final tribal council all the way back from the Edge of Extinction with a  shot to win the game! Who would have ever thought that could happen? Chris, come on over. First individual immunity win couldn't come at a better time. Guaranteed a spot at the final tribal council. Tonight you will decide which one of these three, Devens, Gavin,  or Julie you choose to have sit next to you and which two you force to battle  for their spot in a fire-making showdown. I'm sure it's going to be an interesting afternoon for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you guys tonight at trial. Congrats. Well done. <br/>I didn't think it would take 38 days before I got my first  immunity challenge win, but tonight this is absolutely the most important  decision I'll have the make. I'm not playing this game for second, third, or fourth. I'm playing this game to win. <br/>The immunity challenge didn't go according to plan that. Challenge was the difference between the final three possibly  and going home. <br/>Really incredible job. <br/>Crazy. Third vote out to final three. <br/>Chris has the control right now. I mean, he's determining who is safe tonight and who is building  fire tonight. <br/>Glad I have the necklace around my neck. <br/>Look what we have? <br/>We have tools to make fire with. <br/>I don't want to go to fire. There's a lot of randomness that goes into it. I have worked so hard to take the randomness out of my game, but  I'm not giving up. <br/>This is cool. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Well, you guys grab your stuff and definitely practice. <br/>I just have to convince Chris to take me to the final  three by letting him know how loyal I have been to him. <br/>I can talk to each one of you guys. <br/>Let's do it, buddy. <br/>I'm trying everything I can to guarantee a spot. This is $1 million we're talking about. This is a whole change to my life and my family's life. <br/>Want me to plead my case? <br/>Yeah, I do? <br/>You know by being loyal to you, I feel like I either  secured my place in the game or sunk my game. I obviously could have withheld the idol yesterday, and you  would be out. I mean, you know there hasn't been any hesitation about me being  loyal to you since we came back. So it would be nice to get pay back there. <br/>Did you practice fire before coming out here? <br/>Yeah, at this point, you have to make fire tonight. You played the $1 million game. Devens and I have gone through a lot this game, but I'm afraid. I'm going to go practice fire. <br/>If he goes to plead his case at the final tribal,  regardless of who is sitting there, we all lose to Devens. <br/>What's Devens saying? <br/>Devens is trying to plead his case. <br/>For you to just take him? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Is that something you're actually considering? <br/>I feel like I would be the stupidest "Survivor"  player ever. <br/>None of us stand a chance. The way I look at it is you help me get prepared for tonight and  then I'm going to try my best to beat him. I don't really think Julie has a shot. <br/>What I'm going to do is I don't know who is going the take  him, whether it's you or Julie, but I'm going to help you make fire. And I'm going to help Julie make fire. And the best person is going to take him on at fire. <br/>Chris is trying to figure out who to send to fire and who  is going to be easier the beat. He's in the final three now. -important thing is don't try to start too quick. <br/>Devens is someone I don't want to go against in the  fire-making challenge, but if I have to go against him, then I'm going to go  to fire tonight, and I'm going to win. <br/>That's how you do it. Then I'm going to show Julie how to do it. As well. <br/>All right. So when I see a flame like that --  You want to fold it over. <br/>And then you want to stuff it in there. <br/>We need Devens knocked out of this game. If you want a sure bet against Devens, it may not be me, but I'm  happy to step up and takinge the challenge. <br/> Yes. <br/>I feel like I'm underestimated. I feel like I will be practicing fire for the rest of the day. <br/>Everything is similar find right now. Make fire or go home. <br/>There has never been this much pressure. There's a lot riding on it. Whether it's Gavin or Julie, it doesn't really make a difference  in what I have to do. I put everything into this. To set myself up for this scenario. If I work hard enough and focus hard enough. I can do anything. I've done it in this game. That's something I'm taking to the fire making tonight. <br/>Tonight I've got so much on the line. This is the biggest decision I have to make. I'm wearing the necklace. I have total control. Julie and Gavin think that they can beat Rick in fire. <br/>We can do it. <br/>But I feel like I'm at a high-stakes poker table, and I  have a hand that might win, and it also might not, so I might have to be  flat-out daring, stick all my chips in, and let whatever happens happen. All bets are off. It's for $1 million, man. <br/>Jeff: All right. So let's get down to it, final immunity challenge. Chris, you pulled it off, guaranteeing yourself a spot in the  final three. You will get chance to plead your case why you deserve the title  of sole Survivor and the $1 million prize. In a lot of ways extinction is a big part of the reason you're  where you are in this game. <br/>Yeah. A lot of those jury members know my journey, and since coming  back from the Edge of Extinction and beating out literally some of the best  competitors the game has ever seen, my journey was really uphill. So I had to make some moves, and I had to win today. <br/>Jeff: So you guys head back to camp. There are three people that are really excited to talk to you. Julie, what was your case? <br/>I didn't plead my case today because I would be so  grateful if he chose me to be in the final three, but I would also love to be  able to prove myself and make fire. So I went off and practiced making fire and he was very helpful  in giving me suggestions and some tips, but I'm happy with whatever he  decides. <br/>I don't want to be chosen. I want to earn it. So don't pick me. <br/>Well, this is great. [laughter]  I want to go against Devens. I don't want to go against Julie. <br/>Jeff: Wow. That's a remarkable statement. I want fire. And I want Devens. <br/>Yeah. Gavin knows it's a great opportunity to put one more thing on  the resume and take out the obvious fRont-runner for this season. So, yeah, Gavin has a good point. <br/>Chris and I want to be really loyal. I feel like easy decision tonight. <br/>Jeff: Chris, throughout the afternoon did you waiver at  all on your decision, or were you locked in? <br/>One thing the edge thought me is it's okay to be by  yourself for a little while. As I looked out at the ocean and just wached the waves, I knew  more and more exactly what I needed to do. I came into this game wanting to have no regrets, and I wouldn't  want there to be any other way for this season to end. It's the biggest risk I'm taking, so tonight I am offering up my  immunity necklace, giving it to Julie. <br/>For real? <br/>This is your, Julie. And I will be making fire against Rick Devens tonight. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: Chris, is it part of your spiritual journey that you  want to see what you're made of, or do you need you believe you need to beat Devens  in the fire making to have a chance to win? <br/>I have always been the guy who wants to take the last  shot. If I make it, that will prove that I deserve to win and be the  sole Survivor. <br/>Jeff: All right. Julia, Gavin, you will be in the final tribal council. Who will join you? Will it be Chris or Devens? They're going to showdown in a fire-making, do-or-die challenge. Because of the severe Fijian winds tonight, we're going to do  this showdown up in the voting confessional where many decisions have been  made this season, and one of the biggest is going to play out up there  tonight. Chris, Devens, your fire making stations up there waiting for  you. Head up. <br/>Oh, my God. I'll keep you all posted. <br/>Jeff: Chris, Devens, you both have a flint, knife, same  amount of fire-making supplies. The rules are simple. You have to build a fire with a flame high enough to burn the  rope and raise the flag. Make sense? <br/>Yep. <br/>Jeff: Both ready? <br/>Yeah, man. <br/>Historic. <br/>Jeff: Here we go? Survivors ready? Go. 38 days on "Survivor," and it comes down to this for  both Chris and Devens. $1 million on the line. Julie and Gavin are already in the final three. One more spot open. Chris building a little bit of a structure before he starts  working with his flint. Devens gets to his flint first, shaving off some magnesium. Chris starting to shave magnesium now. Devens now going for a spark, trying the light that magnesium. This is a potential $1 million fire you're trying to build. Devens got a little bit of something. But it goes out quickly. Chris now going far spark. Both guys trying to get a spark going now. Chris has flame quickly. Trying the keep it going. It goes out. Devens has a little bit of flame. He's trying the keep it going. <br/>You have to have something for it to take to. Devens' fire goes out. Chris's fire go out. Both guys scraping again. Chris now getting more magnesium while Devens is trying to get a  spark. Devens has little bits of flame but nothing catching yet. Chris has a little something. It comes back the life. Devens now has a fire. He can turn it into something. It goes out again. Chris has a little bit of flame now. Got to get some sticks going. <br/>Chris got it. <br/>Devens has had a little fire but can't turn it into a  flame that will stick. He's got to get a fire going. Chris adding a few more sticks. Trying to make sure that the flame he has will stay burning as  he tries to build it higher. Devens not panicking now. Scraping more magnesium. Chris's fire continuing to grow. Little by little. Devens still trying to get a spark, a little bit of flame to  give him life in this challenge. And he does. Devens now has a fire. He's got a flame going. And it's going to stick. One thing to have a fire. But you've got to get that flame high enough to burn through the  rope Devens has a nice fire going. Can he catch Chris in time? <br/>Come on. Come on! And Chris's fire is starting to hit the rope. First starting to burn. It's over. Chris has earned his way into the final three in an historic  move taking on Devens. <br/>Good job, bro. Straight up showdown. <br/>Jeff: So, Chris, that was one of the biggest moves that  has ever been made in the game. To pull yourself out of the final three to try to work your way  back in, you've got to feel on some level as though you have completed your Survivor  journey, giving up that necklace. <br/>It was like going back on the Edge of Extinction. I had to earn my spot to get back in this game and I had to earn  it against the best one who played this season. <br/>Jeff: Devens, you found a lot of idols. You won a lot of immunity challenges, and yet on the night of  the 38th day out here, you fall short and the game is over. You now join the jury. What's this experience been for you? <br/>I didn't come out here to learn about myself. I didn't come out here to find out anything about myself. I just wanted to win $1 million. But it has a way of teaching you things about yourself, whether  you want to learn or not. I take a lot of confidence away. I didn't think I would perform as well as I did in challenges. I didn't think I would find idols. I didn't think I would have the guts to make fake idols. I felt like I put everything I had into the game. And I fended off elimination from tribal after tribal. But I'm going home a better dad, a better husband, and I think I  feel like I can do a lot of things that I might not have thought before. <br/>Jeff: All right. Devens, quite a journey, going to extinction, fighting your way  back in and getting to this point is an amazing story. 38 days is where it ends. Grab your torch. <br/>Good luck. It's been blast. <br/>Love you guys. <br/>Jeff: Devens, the tribe has spoken. <br/>You become the final member of the jury. [applause]  Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Julie, Chris, Gavin, congratulations. You have gone as far as you can go in this game. You have made it to the final. Now the power in the game shifts to the jury. Same people that you voted out either directly or indirectly are  now in control. Tomorrow night you will face your final tribal council where you  will plead your case about why you were the one that deserves the title of  sole Survivor and the $1 million check that goes with it. It is your last night in Fiji. Try to get some sleep. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. See you tomorrow night. <br/>This just into the newsroom: Chris's flame breaks the rope  and Devens' heart. Plus an applause as he exits brings tears to his eyes. I'm Rick Devens. It's been a pleasure bringing you the news, but this is all for  us. I hope to see you in the real world real soon. <br/>Jeff: Well, he fought his way back from extinction. He found idols. He won challenges. He drove his tribe crazy and he nearly pulled off the  impossible. Come on out, Devens. [cheering and applause] look at that. Standing ovague. -- ovation. Take that in, brother. Take that in. So have a seat. Have a seat, guys. That was really nice. What does that feel like? Because you've gotten love this entire season. <br/>It feels -- this feels great. Watching that was rougher. Man, I just put so much into it. But this is awesome. It's been really -- the "Survivor" family, man, they  come through, don't they? <br/>Jeff: They do. And the show really -- when people connect, and there is a  relatable story, let's just talk about the two big pivotal moves. <br/>Jeff: Okay. You remain loyal to Chris and give him back that idol, was that  truly because you just felt you couldn't betray him again? <br/>It was. You know, when you go to the Edge of Extinction, you're faced  with the people that you betrayed, and I felt honestly out there like I had  wrecked Chris. Like I was very worried about him. He was so big to me when I went out there. He was kind. He didn't hold it against me. <br/>Jeff: So you wanted to heal that wound. <br/>I wanted to heal it, and I could not do that to him again. You can't explain it to people, but I would not have been able  to withhold the idol at tribal, you know, like, sorry, buddy. <br/>Jeff: Okay. So when you get the quid pro quo moment, and he doesn't remain  loyal, in fact, he takes you on, is that a betrayal or is it game play or can  it be both? <br/>It can be both in "Survivor." it can be both in  "Survivor." it certainly wasn't quid pro quo with the loyalty, but  he guaranteed me final four. And he got me final four, and then he made a move. <br/>Jeff: All right. One last question. Given the reception here, it's obvious that you relate the  people and you're very funny and charming. We could always count on you for a newscast. Your career, you're in macon georgia, great city where you live,  and that's your home, but career wise it's a smaller market. <br/>Yes, yes. <br/>Jeff: Are you open or have you gotten any interest, if  somebody wanted you on a morning show, are you open to moving? It's just a -- are you open to that? <br/>As long as my bosses could switch channels real quick, I'm  open to anything. I'm open to anything. Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: We have our final three. Devens, it's not you. All right. It's a push to the finish. The finale right after this. How does that feel, man? <br/>Sausage. Eggs, pancake mix. <br/>Pancakes on the griddle. <br/>I cannot believe I have made it to day 39 on  "Survivor." I came out here to have the adventure of a lifetime,  and I needed to prove to myself and to my kids that I was stRong enough to be  able to do this. <br/>Let's do a toast. I wanted to be this role model to them that was more than a mom,  show them they could accomplish something that was on such a bigger level. <br/>We're on "Survivor." we're in day 39, the final  breakfast. <br/>I have been playing the game from day one to day 39, but I  have been playing it in my own way. <br/>I'll never forget this breakfast. <br/>I actually cried and leaned on almost every person out  here and got their support and at the same time gave them support back. I think that's one of the reasons I've made it to the final  three is because of the relationships that I spent so much time building. I know that jury is going to be brutal, but I played a game  that's worthy of being granted the title of the sole Survivor, and I'm going  to prove that tonight. <br/>What's your biggest dream? <br/>Playing "Survivor."  What about you in. <br/>My dream is to buy a sailboat and take my family and I  want to sail around the world. <br/>Gavin and Julie, they're trying to out, last but they  don't know what outlast really means. I spent 28 days on the Edge of Extinction. <br/>Glad to have met you, Gavin, even though you tried to vote  me out. I am the player I am because of the Edge of Extinction. It took will and grit and reflection. And when I got back in the game, in three days, my game was  better than two other players who had 39 days to do the same thing. There is nothing I can hang my head about. Because in my heart, I know that I did everything I possibly  could to make it here and to plead a true and honest case to the people who  are about to reward someone with a life-changing prize. <br/>Two days before I left, like I made vows to my wife that I  was going to protect her. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If I don't seize every opportunity whenever I have the chance,  then I'm going to go back home and think, what if. <br/>I think my biggest challenge with the jury is I don't want  people to think I just went along with the votes. I want them to know that me being such a stRong social player, I  had different routes to go, and it wasn't me just jumping on a train and  riding along with it. <br/>It was matter of me being so socially aware that I could  go whichever path that was best going to benefit me. If I would have been set in my ways, I wouldn't be where I am  today if I had played one game. I had to move around in order to get in this stage of the game. Tonight is the biggest bat until 39 days, and I have to bring it  and I'm ready. Sole Survivor. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. So Gavin, Chris, Julie, congratulations. You have lasted 39 days. You have gone as far as you can go, and tonight you have one  final task, convince the jury that you are the one most deserving of the  title of sole Survivor and the million dollars that goes with it. We'll start with this outwit part of the game. Emotional intelligence, alliances, relationships outside of  those, ethics and morals if those played this season. Who wants to get us started? <br/>Yes, mad respect for all of you guys. All we want is to vote for the best player, and I think it will  help to take real ownership of your game. I want to know what relationship was the most valuable in your  game. We'll start with you. <br/>I have to go with victorya. Me and Victoria were with each other for 35 days, something  along that line. We worked together on everything. So Victoria was my stRongest ally in this game, 100%. <br/>Great. <br/>Chris? <br/>The stRongest ally that I had was Rick. But I got sent to the Edge of Extinction. I could have been bitter. I could have been frustrated and upset, but I made my way back  in, and again I went with Rick, and I said, hey, we're going to get to final  four together. <br/>And Julie, your stRongest relationship in the game? <br/>My closest relationships were with Ron and Eric. I continued to build my relationship with Ron. My heart was broken when he got blindsided. I had a secret relationship with Lauren that kept me in the game  and that was an extremely stRong bond that a lot of people didn't know about. <br/>Thanks a lot. <br/>I want to ask Chris on the Edge of Extinction, there were  some social politics very much at work. Can you tell me how you were being strategic acted your social  relationships there? <br/>Yeah. We were outside of the game, but we were still in the game. So I tried the make really genuine honest relationships with  each person. When I cooked rice and coconut in the morning, whenever I caught  stingray and fish and we'd all come together around the fire, that was part  of my social game play through providing. Because I wasn't out of the game yet. <br/>You know, we were talking about the Edge of Extinction,  and only one person is coming back from that. <br/>I want to open it up for you right now. In the 28 days that Chris was doing his social game play on Edge  of Extinction, what social relationships and strategies were you having to  navigate? <br/>You have to deal with getting sent home. My social game was my strategic game, building bonds and having  people's trust and getting them to trust me so they could come to me with  information. This whole game I have built social relationships with basically  everyone over here. <br/>Gavin, my question is are you building those relationships  as someone in charge or are you building those at a goat. <br/>I'm building the relationships as someone who is in charge  because I'm still here. I'm not anyone's goat. I chose the rout I chose. No one dictated that for me. <br/>Can we let the jury ask the questions? That was rude. <br/>Hey, Julie. Thank you for being patient. <br/>No problem. I get it. I get it. <br/>Same question. What were you dealing with as you went through the game, people,  managing relationships? <br/>I was the neurotic new yorker. I can't hide that. I decided to take that "Weakness" and use it as a  social strategy, as a strength. It's not that the emotions were fake and I was building these  relationships, it's that I wasn't going to hide them. <br/>Can I just interject, your emotions in this game do play a  role and you have to feel those emotion, but does that affect how you  navigate your next move? <br/>I can't control and turn them on and off so quickly. But when they come out, it was using them as a social strategy  in my game. <br/>Julie, so as somebody that was on the receiving of one of  many emotional breakdowns, you're saying that that was used as a strength in  your game is like, come on, like...  Well, I think we may not be giving you enough credit for  how clever your game might have been. Give me one big you think you did. <br/>So using my emotions as part of my strategy, the tribal  council that Julia got voted out, I feel like I swayed that vote. <br/>Did you ever think there was a possibility you would have  been voted out? No. <br/>.01. <br/>Let me explain. <br/>I was on rock bottom. Ron's paranoia was sky high. I had a very specific idea of how I wanted that tribal council  to go. I had already thrown out Julia's name that day. <br/>I don't feel like the vote would have switched if I hadn't  said anything and Wardog hadn't called on me. <br/>What I meant is it was a catalyst for conversations that  were going to start. All I needed to do was get the conversation going and I jumped  on it fast. <br/>Let me get this straight, your most clever move was to  possibly throw out Julia's name and hope a Wardog would come save the day? <br/>I didn't consider that you saved the day, but I knew I  wanted to try switch things up. <br/>And let Chris and Gavin answer the question. <br/>I think a big move I made, even though I don't feel great,  was people like Aubry and Joe, people I knew were respected players, but  that's where I had to separate my heart from the game play. <br/>That was very clear. I felt like a piece of taxidermy quite frankly this season, but  to be fair, dwaffen was one of the only people to come up to me and even  pretend that he was willing to work with me. I just want to say that. <br/>I was willing to work with you. <br/>I will say the person I trusted of the three of you was Gavin. <br/>So Chris, now, the big move? <br/>The original question is I spent 28 days on the Edge of  Extinction. And I just want to remind you guys that like Julie did not go to  aa tribal council until day 17 at the merge. So basically we were on the same playing field, you know. <br/>So we know you only played 12 days in the actual game, but  that's ample time to make a big move. <br/>So getting back into the game, I knew that I had to get  through one tribal with no immunity around my neck, no idols at play, but I  got Lauren to promise me that if Devens' idol was real that she was going the  play her idol for me. <br/>Are you claiming that as your move? <br/>Yeah, I'm claiming that was a big strategic move. Because we all knew Lauren had an idol. Thank you, Kelley. My gratitude is to you. <br/>Verbal diarrhea. Sorry. <br/>Lauren, how did he convince you to do that? <br/>I know, right. It's really sad. <br/>The answer your question, Ron, it's actually a sales  technique. It's called a negative reverse. You have to be less okay than a prospect for them to feel like  they need them to save you. <br/>He played me like a violin. <br/>Clever. <br/>Just curious, how many people are willing to say that are  still undecided? Wow. <br/>You guys are dag great job. It can feel like the inquisition. So keep fighting. <br/>Don't stop fighting. <br/>Jeff: Speaks to the game you are all playing when you have  the jury saying keep fighting and everybody undecided. <br/>All right. Let's move into the outplay part of the game. This is the conditions that are put on you. You have to build shelter. You have to compete in challenges. You have to deal with idols and advantages or twists and  switches. Edge of Extinction was a big part of the outplay this season. So who wants to get us started? <br/>I'll get us started. Guys, there were a lot of idols out there. I found them because I got out there and I hustled and worked  hard and found them. Why didn't you? <br/>I was looking a lot. And you may have heard many screams as I was looking every time  I came across a bug or a lizard or a crab hiding in a tree holm I was  looking, and I was looking so well I found your fake one. So I found an idol. <br/>I looked a little bit also, but I was on the side with the  numbers for every vote but one, so I knew it wasn't going to be the end of  the world. <br/>Chris, do you think that it's an unfair advantage that not  only do you come in with just three days left in the individual game, but you  have all this extra information and strategy you received from the Edge of  Extinction. <br/>Actually the Edge of Extinction was an unfair advantage to  me despite even having information, because I had to play the biggest  possible game with three days that I could possibly play. So I flushed an idol, played an idol correctly my second vote,  won immunity challenge on the final day, and biggest move of the game, by  far, give up my necklace to earn my spot back into the game by making fire  against the number-one competitor in the entire season. And that's the best that I could possibly do. There was no other scenario. <br/>From my perspective, I think it's an unfair advantage  because he didn't find that second idol. That was giving to him. He would have been voted out if he hadn't been given that idol. <br/>My question is how do you think you convinced him to give  you back half the idol? <br/>Because in this game we so easily forget about social  capital. It's 38 seasons of "Survivor," and we really have  forgotten that you cannot treat people like chess pieces. The game we fell in love with was not just about deceit and  backstabbing and blindsiding. You cannot think that somebody is who is going to be loyal with  you to the end is someone you can screw around. So you're asking me why? It's because my relationship with Devens was real. And when I told him I wanted him to go to final four, I mend it. <br/>I respect everything you're saying, but if you want to  talk about classic "Survivor," then it's surviving 39 day, it's not  getting voted out on day eight and coming back on day 35 and having a chance  to win this game. I don't think you can talk about playing classic  "Survivor" and you having missed the opportunity. <br/>But the game evolves. This is a theme. It's the Edge of Extinction. Chris played with the days that he had in the game and to see  what he was able to do in the last few days hoping that you would have done  just a percentage of that. Like 39 dares isn't everything. What did you do with those 39 days. <br/>I built social bonds to get me through this game, like  being over. There you don't have to worry about anything. You don't have to worry about something backstabbing you or  blindssiding you. I would love to reconnect with Eric and Aubry and all these  people I done these wRongs to, but I feel like I'm at a disadvantage. <br/>And there is a lot of stress and mental fatigue that takes  place in the game that you let go of when you're on the Edge of Extinction. So there's a balance there. <br/>Look, the jury is not on trial. You three are on trial. I'm hearing some really good answers, but sometimes this game is  about some player making a play better than you. You know, that's it. <br/>Well, I think there is another side to that. Could everyone here that didn't get their name written down  raise their hand, everybody, jury included, who never had their name written  down? Pretty good. <br/>All right. We'll now move into the outlast part of the game. This is your chance to sum up your journey. What did it take for you to get from day one to day 39? How does it differ from the other two? Gavin, get us started. <br/>Today Chris asked me what my dream was. I said, well, it was the play "Survivor," but once I  got out hear here. I realize my dream is everything I have back home. My dream is to be the son to the best parents I have. To be a brother. To be the best damn husband that I can be for the girl who moved  everything in her life for me to have this opportunity. So I played with my heart, but I wasn't playing with my heart  for you guys. I was playing with my heart for her, like every decision I made,  it was in order for me to move one day closer to winning this game so I could  protect her, to honor her, and to provide for her. So thank you, guys. <br/>Jeff: Chris? Well, a lot of you guys know my journey because I was real with  you on the Edge of Extinction, but I came into this game, and I wanted to  control. I wanted to play this perfect game. And I got blindsided. And Edge of Extinction taught me I had to come to terms with  letting go of control. And that ball dropped. I made my way back into the game. And I knew the odds were stacked so far against me that I had  literally had to do the best possible move every single time. So I'm sitting here as the first player to give up his final  four immunity necklace to force fire with the number-one competitor of the  season and one, and the first player to be part of the Edge of Extinction  with family that was outside of the tribe. And that was a $1 million experience whether I won $1 million or  not. I'm happy with whatever you decide. I respect your decision. <br/>Jeff: Julie? <br/>I think it's safe to say whether it's sitting over here or  over there, we have all had an incredible personal journey playing this game. Mine has been life changing, like literally life changing. When I got out here on day one, all I had in my mind was getting  to day 39 and actually winning this game, and I never lost sight of that. And I may not be the type of player that most of you are. I am not an aggressive player. I am not somebody who likes confRontation, but why does that  mean that that player is any less worthy of winning this game and one of the  reasons that I said I wanted to come out here was to prove to myself that I  was stRong and they was valuable because I have felt underestimated a lot of  my life, and coming out here, you get this clarity that you can't believe you  didn't see at home. It was playing this game that has made me see, I'm already who I  am I came to prove to be. And I'm so thankful that you were respectful to all three of us,  because you all were a part of what made it life changing for me. <br/>Jeff: All right. Only one thing left to do. We'll give you a moment the take in everything you heard  tonight, and then we will vote. You three are on trial! Wardog throwing it down. The vote for a winner is next. Edge of Extinction finale! <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to bring this 39-day adventure to a conclusion. Tonight you are voting for a winner. Reem, you're up. I'll go get the votes. Gavin, Chris, Julie, thank you for another great season of  "Survivor." ly see you in los angeles for the reading of the votes. Ly see you in los angeles for the reading of the votes.
