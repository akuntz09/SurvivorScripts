<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," at the Manu  tribe, Wendy was making enemies. <br/>Wendy let the chickens go. <br/>She kind of went nuts. <br/>At the Kama tribe, Joe thought he was making friends. <br/>I feel great with you, bro. <br/>I feel great with you, too. I acted like I love him, but he's a returning player, and he can  be really dangerous. <br/>Jeff: At the Lesu tribe, David and devon saw eye to eye. <br/>I'm not going to write your name down no matter what. <br/>Jeff: And so did Lauren and Kelley. <br/>I want to vote with you. <br/>Yeah, I want to vote with you. <br/>Jeff: Leaving Wardog in the middle. <br/>It's classic. I'm in a swing-vote spot. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Wardog made up his mine. Devon, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Jeff:leaving Devens with a de to make. Grab a torch and go to the edge of distinction or go home. Grab a torch and go to the edge of distinction or go home. <br/>I was voted out last night. I thought I was going home and eating a burger and drinking a  beer. I get thrown on to the edge of distinction with three people who  are so happy I failed. Everything about edge of distinction, starting with that big map  just says, you don't want to be here, you're not going to enjoy yourself,  it's going to suck. <br/>You okay? <br/>But to me it's just another test put in fRont of you where  it's like, do you have the fortitude to go into something you know nothing  about and see it through and come out on top?Ã± you know nothing about and  see it through and come out on top?Ã±  Jeff: Come on in, guys. Kama, Manu getting your first look at the new Lesu tribe. Devens voted out at the last tribal council. All right. Shall we get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, you'll race through a series  of obstacles collecting bolos along the way. You'll then attempt to land those bolos on a target. First two tribes to finish win reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Jeff: First tribe to finish, a little something from home. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Jeff: Peanut butter and jelly, peanut butter and jelly,  first tribe to finish plus a jar of peanut butter and jelly, loaf of bread  and ice cold milk. Second tribe to finish, not as much, a small plate of p.B. And j. Last tribe to finish, nothing. Kama, you have one extra person. Sitting someone out. Who is it going to be in. <br/>I'll sit. <br/>Jeff: Eula, take a spot on the bench. Manu, one extra person. Aubry, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, take a minute to strategize and we'll get going. All right. Here we go. For reward, Survivors ready? Go! First you got to get through the rope bramble. Nothing easy about this. Launch yourself through it. Julie comes out. Wendy is through. Wardog is through. Wentworth is through. Manu, you're good. Start working. Kama, you're good. Lesu, you're good. You got to lift someone up to get the two bolos. David almost dropped by his tribe. <br/>Hold me. Hold me. <br/>Jeff: David struggling again. Julie has the first for Kama. Victoria has the first for Manu. This group of four on Lesu continues to struggle in every  challenge. David goes down hard. You're good, Manu. You're good, Kama. Now you got to crawl to get your next two bolos. <br/>Give me your hand! <br/>Jeff: Now it's Lauren trying to get up. Absolute disaster for Lesu. They finally have Lauren out. <br/>Go, go! <br/>Jeff: Kama has your next two. You can start throwing, Kama. Manu has their four. You're good, Manu. Every tribe member has to land one bolo. <br/>Got to throw way harder. <br/>Jeff: Lauren still working on that last bolo. She's got it. <br/>Dammit, Wardog. <br/>Jeff: And a big fall by Lauren. Gavin's first for Manu. Their first. Lesu fighting to stay in this peanut butter and jelly challenge. <br/>Go, Wardog! <br/>Jeff: Wentworth is through. Wardog. You're good, Lesu. Start throwing. It is Manu with one. Nobody else on the board. Lauren tosses. She just misses. <br/>You got it. <br/>Jeff: Aurora on and off. Eric with a nice touch. And that will work. Ron now up for Kama. Ron withã§ã³ a nice toss. That will hook. Ron has the first for Kama. Joe with one toss lands the second. You have to land four. Wendy scores the third for Manu. It is now Manu with three and Kama with two. Lesu still with nothing. <br/>Can I go yet? <br/>Jeff: There goes David now trying to get into it for Lesu. David just misses. David sprinting back to get his bolo. Victoria for the win. Nice and soft but going to fall short. Aurora scores the third for Kama. It is now Manu with three and Kama with three. It is Victoria versus Julie for the win. Just short. Julie can win it right here. And she does! Kama wins reward. We're looking for second. Wentworth launches and sticks it. Victoria for the win. Just misses. <br/>Guys, I'm so tired. <br/>Jeff: Wardog now in. And he snags the second for Lesu. Suddenly Lesu is back in it. Here goes Lauren. Just short. For the win, Victoria. And she does it! Manu wins reward, peanut butter and jelly, leaving Lesu empty  handed once again. Kama, the five of you have lost one challenge this entire  season. Big victory today. Huge reward of p.B. And j will be waiting for you back at camp. Grab your stuff, head become and enjoy it. Manu, nice victory for you. Your p.B. And j. Will be waiting for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. Enjoy the afternoon. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Wow. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think we're running out of adjectives to describe these  defeats. It's almost like we're cursed or something. We have to think positive, and we keep going back and saying  that, we have to think positive. It's the only way out of this. <br/>Jeff: Interesting. I didn't even ask a question. You already know the story that is unfolding. All right. Lesu, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>God, like how bad can we be? You have David, who basically acts as a female. I mean, he weighs less than me. Basically we have three girls and Wardog. So I'm just trying to figure out what to do, because we can't  win anything. <br/>One, two, three, Kama! <br/>Winning that reward just showed us once again that the Kama  tribe is a force to be reckoned with in this game. We are completely dominating and we're on this winning streak. <br/>Love you guys so much. <br/>You guys killed that. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>However, it is in the back of my mind that Joe is the  biggest threat in the game right now, so I would rather get him out of this  game sooner rather than later. <br/>How lucky are we? <br/>We're spoiled. <br/>We're all love and sunshine and sprinkles and rainbows  right now on Kama stRong, but it's pretty obvious that I'm a big target and  that I'm a challenge beast, so it sucks. It's really difficult to try to shake that stigma. So I'm just trying to do anything I can to make it comfortable  for my tribe mates, make them feel like they need me so that I'm not the one  going home. So that I'm not the one going home. <br/>Where's Joe right now? <br/>At the beach. <br/>This is like our one shot to get him out premerge  probably. <br/>Joe's dangerous. But there three of us, if we can blind side him, it would be  huge. <br/>I'm in a good situation game-wise. And since day one, I kept telling everyone we have to get rid of  Joe, but now I have another consideration. Joe is a workhorse. I mean, he knows everything, and a lot of our people on our  tribe do not. We're not catching the fish. And we're not getting all the food. We don't know what to do. And so I'm starting to realize, I don't like the thought of camp  without Joe. I think I'll be miserable. Joe is allowing us to win all these challenges so we don't have  to go to tribal. If we are without Joe, we're probably going to lose them. <br/>We can survive without him. We can't let him keep making a case of why he should win if he's  done everything. <br/>True. <br/>Joe cannot go too far in this game. That's a no-brainer. And I'm very concerned that the four returning players are all  still in the game. <br/>Come merge, he's going to be so hard to get out of this  game. But when he doesn't see it coming... If you don't get rid of  returning players, by the time the merge hits, they could run away with the  whole thing, so if we were to lose immunity, Joe has to go now. <br/>So p.B. And j. Powers activate. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Ready? <br/>Peanut butter and jelly, it's like a flavor change, some  protein. It's pretty good, but I'm so hungry today. Today is first day I'm like real hungry. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I feel like if we can't fish, we should eat a chicken. <br/>If I see one, I'll grab one. Wendy doesn't want us to eat the chickens. So they're free range. They're part of the island. <br/>As long as they don't end up dead. <br/>I feel like working with Wendy would be more like carrying  around an alarm clock, but you have no clue when it's going to go off, but  there is an issue of the returners. The longer they're in the game, the more dangerous it gets. So like all things in this game, it's a balancing act. <br/>Like they're gone and they're out there and it bothers me  that they're out there. We're in the "Survivor" waiting room right now on the Manu  tribe. We haven't gone to tribal yet. Nothing has happened, and we're talking about chickens. It's so frustrating. Like "Survivor," there are many ghosts in the jungle  in Fiji. I am dying to play. I came in aggressive. I found my idol. And I kind of simmered down. Now we got to heat the dish back up, so what I'm trying to do is  figure out who the strategists are and find myself one that is going to be  able to wake up from the Kama kool-aid and do something about everything come  the merge. <br/>Would you rather go into the merge with Aubry or with Wendy? <br/>I think I'd rather go with Wendy just because she's less  of a strategic threat. <br/>What if I went to Aubry and said, do you want to do a  girl's thing, so if she does have an idol, she would literally never play her  idol. It would make me believe more I'm not with you guys. It feels like the safest way to placate and. And then she would feel more comfortable. <br/>I think it would be a good diversion. I think we tell Wendy, say, let's just tell her --  I think it's in our best interest to get rid of Aubry  first when she doesn't see it coming. As a person, I really like Aubry, but for me, it might sound bo  bad, but I have no problem separating friendships from the game. Like I don't really care about how people feel out here, but now  I have to keep Aubry thinking that I'm on her side. <br/>Like I have no clue what Jeff has in store, and everybody  here is like, I don't know unless I'm missing something major, people are  really calm, which is good. <br/>Yeah, I think everyone is calm, because we have our buffer  vote. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think so for sure.ÃI but you have seen  "Survivor." you know it's like...  Nothing is going to be this easy. <br/>It's going to get weird. I just wanted to see where your head was at. <br/>Would it make sense while we still have Wendy, to do  something with Wendy, me and you, me you and Wendy. <br/>We could. <br/>Because if we get rid of like an Eric in the next vote and  Gavin after that. <br/>Victoria said, we have to go after the big boys sooner or  later, and I was psyched to hear her say that. <br/>I think you're the only one I trust even a little bit  right now. <br/>Vick was just under my nose. She's been sneaky the whole time. Those glasses may be big. Maybe I didn't see her eyes open. <br/>We're the misfits that couldn't. <br/>Obviously the tribe is in need of a serious pick-me-up. I was thinking if you and I want to try to go fishing. <br/>I've never fished before in my life. Honestly, I'm half full of rice. I have no calories. <br/>Okay. That's fair. This tribe is so on the edge of distinction that scientists  stopped looking for us. They already think we're dead. We're like the last four dodo birds living on a remote island,  and I think I'm next should we lose the next immunity challenge. <br/>I'll try to find snails. If I know my "Survivor" history at all, there is  absolutely a hidden immunity idol on the new Lesu tribe. Finding it is critical. <br/>It's so frustrating. <br/>Because I need it bad. I look around at all my peers back home, and they're married and  they have kids. And it's something that kind of escaped me for years. I'm 44 years old. All I have is a two-bedroom apartment and some d.V.D.S on a shelf. But I need to shake that. I need to shake that in my life and I need to shake that in this  game. It wasn't until I played "Survivor" the first time  that I think I really started to get up off the couch and start living my  life again. It's time to build on that and move forward rather than just  stay in this one spot. So I absolutely want the find the hidden immunity idol. I keep looking and I keep coming up short. But I will never give up in this game. <br/>He's the biggest problem in every challenge. <br/>He can't go off by himself. <br/>We can't trust him. <br/>I have been so sick. Luckily Wardog is on my side. Kelley is on my side. And I have an idol from the original Manu. So if we go to another tribal, it's going to be David. <br/>Okay. Here's what I'm thinking. <br/>Okay. <br/>I think that me and you make the best combo post-merge. I really do. One major concern is a David idol. <br/>Yes. <br/>Okay. The second major concern is in the become of my mind, if it's  me, you, and Lauren, I'm thinking that Lauren and you might take me out. And you're thinking Lauren and me might take you out. Lauren just hurts us. I think me and you vote Lauren out now. <br/>Wardog is a crazy man. I think he has a little tony in him, but if we do lose, that  seems to be a trend on this tribe, it's always important to have an a, b, and  c plan. I do have a great relationship with Lauren and I want to work  with her, but I feel like Wardog has been truthful with me so far. He's been the one who comes to me with ideas, and desperate  times call for desperate measures. So I have to figure out a game plan that's going to work for me  moving forward. <br/>We take her out. <br/>You're an evil mastermind. It's "Survivor," and it's kill or be killed. <br/>There's something here. This is the most exciting thing that's happened in the last five  days. What the heck is this? Oh, we have news. <br/>Wake up, wake up! We have information. <br/>We have news. All right. I'm going to collect wood, and I find this box. Oh, my God. And it's got something for each of us. <br/>Finally. Hallelujah. <br/>On the Edge of Extinction, you have literally nothing some  as soon as Chris came around the corner with that box,er knew. I freaked. This is something new, some more information. I was like some way or somehow something is going the happen in  my favor. <br/>You're on the Edge of Extinction. Your goal is to get back in the fold. If the stars align, they'll point the way. <br/>Your goal is to get back in the fold. If the stars align, they'll point the way. <br/>Back in the fold. <br/>Are we supposed to fold it so the stars align? <br/>Where are stars? <br/>On the border? <br/>I figured the map out really quick. The stars on the border match up with each other. And you can see that it makes the arrow point right to this tree  with no leaves. Then on the other side, this arrow points right to this tree  with lots of different roots. So it might be my proudest moment on "Survivor" so  far. <br/>It's pointing to the tree. <br/>We're going to have to have a pact we go all together. Am I right? <br/>I agree. <br/>You want to have rice first? <br/>We might as well. That's not to. <br/>Rick figured out the map. To be honest, I was not going to figure out that map. That whole folding the thing together, that never would have  happened. <br/>This is tasty. <br/>This is good. <br/>This spoon is half broken, but it's like my own little  left-handed spoon. <br/>Thank you for the rice, Reem. <br/>It's good to have a mom on your tribe. <br/>Everybody said we're going to go fair and square. I was like, what? I was like, that's not going to happen. <br/>Where is Keith? Where is he? Did he have his shoes on. <br/>Keith, get back here. Keith? <br/>Keith! <br/>Go down there and see if he's walking down there. <br/>Is he going? <br/>Yeah. He's way down there. Oh, my God. <br/>Did he go? <br/>Yes, he went. <br/>Keith, you jerk. <br/>Darn it, that is so -- you know what, that is  disappointing, dude. <br/>Shoes on. <br/>Wow, Keith, what an --  Hurry up. You guys have the map? <br/>Yes. <br/>We're coming for you, Keith. <br/>What a guy. <br/>The path is going to split, just so you know. <br/>This is exactly why we voted him out. <br/>Keith! <br/>I got to find it. I got to find it. Come on, God, come on, God, come on, God. <br/>Is he there? <br/>What the hell, Keith? <br/>This is for family. It's not for Chris. It's not for Reem. <br/>Keith, you dog. <br/>You got him. <br/>Not cool. <br/>You got it, Chris? <br/>Yes. <br/>I look in the tree. I pull out three bamboo rods. There's string attached to these rods. And there's a note. Practice. It says practice on it. This is the first exciting clue to what we're going to be doing  next. My guess, it's got to be something you practice with to get back  into the game. My move is to be that person. <br/>Rick, why did I fold that map right in fRont of everybody? <br/>Chris, you will wait for me, right? <br/>Yes. <br/>I got it. <br/>Chris ran to one tree. I ran to the other. We had the advantages in our hands. <br/>You have earned the right to give this extra vote to any  player heading not next tribal council. They will not know it is from you. Choose wisely. <br/>So I found an advantage they can give one person heading  to tribal council an extra vote. Whoever gets this vote, they have no idea the Edge of Extinction  exists. <br/>That's pretty good for whoever gets it. <br/>It was a wake-up call that we're on the Edge of Extinction,  but we're not out of the game, so I'm playing out here now. <br/>Jeff: All right. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First things first, I got to take back the idol. <br/>Oh. <br/>Jeff: Sorry. You have to give it up. It's part of the game. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to swim out to a ramp, race  up, and leap off. You'll then dive down to retrieve a puzzle piece. Once you have all your pieces, you'll pull your pontoon to the  finish and use those pieces to build a back to buoy pyramid. First two tribes to finish win immunity. Losers, tribal council, where somebody will be voted out of this  game. Sitout, Kama, one extra person. <br/>I'm going to sit out. <br/>Jeff: Julie will sit out for Kama. Manu? <br/>Me. <br/>Jeff: Victoria will sit out for Manu. Everybody else take your spots. We'll get started. All right. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! It is Eric first in for Manu. <br/>Come on, kel. <br/>Aurora first in for Kama. <br/>Come on, Kelley, come on. <br/>Nice and easy. Breathe. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth first in for Lesu. Now you got to dive down and release that first puzzle piece. Eric has it for Manu. Got to get up on that pontoon with your piece. Wentworth now trying to get that mask on. <br/>Jeff: Come on, Kelley, come on. <br/>You got this, Kelley! <br/>Jeff: Go, Manu. Now Aubry in the water for Manu. Aurora cannot get the buoy. This is going to be a setback for Kama. Joe now inãI the water. Aubry can't get it for Manu. Here goes Gavin. He's going to give it a go now. Wentworth still working. She can't get it. <br/>You got to get down there. <br/>Jeff: Joe has it for Kama. They have one of their two pieces. Go, Kama. It's going to be Julie in the water now for Kama. Wentworth still struggling. Going to give up. Wentworth got to get on that pontoon. Wentworth exhausted and came up empty handed. Go, Lesu! It's going to be Lauren in the water now for Lesu. Gavin has the second puzzle piece for Manu. Manu has their two puzzle pieces. Wendy just has to get to the pontoon now. Big lead for Manu. Julia releases the second piece for Kama. Kama now has both their pieces. She's got to get back. You're good, Manu. Unclip and start pulling your pontoon. Go! Kama has both puzzle pieces. Ron just has to get himself to the pontoon. Lesu in dead last once again. They are empty handed. Both of their tribes have both puzzle pieces. Ron back to the pontoon for Kama. Start pulling. Manu now can start working on their pyramid. It's a huge time advantage over Lesu. Here comes Kama. This is the kind of puzzle you could solve very fast as there  are only four pieces. But it will fool you. <br/>We can't do it that way. <br/>Jeff: Manu and Kama fighting for immunity and the  advantage they have is two tribes will win immunity, and right now one tribe  is doing nothing. Lauren now going to give up. She's heading back. This might be one of the biggest blowouts in  "Survivor" history. Once again Lesu with Lauren, Wentworth, Wardog and David have  been through every single tribal. Right now that appears to be a streak that will remain intact as  they have none of their puzzle pieces while both other tribes are already  solving. <br/>Right there. See that? <br/>Jeff: There's only four pieces, but it can be very  difficult. Until you figure it out, and then it will solve instantly. Wardog can't get it either. Wentworth in despair once again. She sees the challenge slipping away. Wardog pops the first puzzle piece for Lesu. There is life for Lesu after all. <br/>David, you can do it! <br/>Jeff: Now David in the water. A chance for David to shine in an enviRonment he really  struggles in, the ocean. <br/>Come on, David. <br/>Jeff: David's got to get down and release it, David. Let's go! The good news is Manu and Kama have not solved the puzzle, so  that door is still technically open for Lesu. <br/>David, come on. Come to the pontoon, I'm going to go. <br/>Jeff: David going to give up and swim back to the pontoon. Somebody from that four will have to go back. Lesu is not a tribe that's quick. They're just a tribe having a very tough time winning. <br/>Get out of the water. <br/>Jeff: Lauren goes back down yet again for another try. Is this the one? <br/>I'm going to get it. I'm going to get it. <br/>I believe in you. You got this. <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: And she does it. Lauren frees that second piece for Lesu. <br/>Tell me when you're ready. <br/>Jeff: Unclip. Start pulling. Here comes Lesu now. We got a challenge. <br/>Pull, guys, pull. <br/>Jeff: Manu and Kama have had a long time to experiment on  this puzzle. But it has resulted in nothing. <br/>I hate puzzles. <br/>Jeff: If Lesu could pull this challenge out, it would be  one of the greatest comebacks in the history of "Survivor". Let's go, Lesu! Victory here would be a major win. <br/>This one. No. <br/>Okay. <br/>No. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Kama thinks they have it. <br/>Pull that up. <br/>Jeff: And that do. Joe is right. Kama wins immunity once again. We're looking for one more. <br/>Four on the bottom. <br/>Quick, quick. <br/>Jeff: Manu is amped up. <br/>Guys, we're so close, guys. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>Jeff: Who is going to get there first? Will it be Manu or Lesu? <br/>This is going to go here. This is going to go right here. Right there. <br/>Is that it? <br/>That might be it. <br/>Jeff: Put that there. Put that there. David trying something different. Lesu thinks they have it. If they have it, it would be their first win. And it is! Lesu wins immunity sending Manu to tribal council. <br/>Yes! Yes! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God, guys. Oh, my God. Guys, guys. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Kama, a familiar story. Once again immunity is yours. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Swim out. Enjoy the night off. Lesu, your first immunity win. For the first time this season David, Lauren, Wentworth, Wardog,  I will not be seeing you at tribal council. Swim out. Enjoy the celebration and the night off. Manu, somebody going home tonight. Swim out. See you tonight at tribal council. <br/>Right now we do have a common goal. We all think Aubry needs to go. But I still think we are making a big move, and big moves are  always risky. So I'm going to pick and choose my words carefully to not overor  under expose what's really happening. <br/>Sorry we couldn't pull it out, guys. <br/>Man. <br/>Going to tribal, I know the drill. It was almost surreal coming back from losing the challenge,  because the four original Kama came together, and it just seemed so easy. <br/>Right now we need this four to go further. <br/>I know. <br/>Like we need this to further ourselves in the game. <br/>We're going to forge this four. <br/>Perfect. -plan is to voted out Wendy. But I was talking to Victoria yesterday, and she said do we go  for one of the big guys right now? <br/>I can tell you want to do something. <br/>Don't want to miss the moment. <br/>No. I'm 1,000% down with you. <br/>The advantage to doing it now is we have numbers. <br/>I think Wendy would do anything to save herself, you know  what I mean? <br/>Yeah, I know. <br/>Having Wendy right now is an opportunity to do something. There are three girl, two guys,. I know vick andry good right now. <br/>We could kill Eric off tonight. I'd like to make a move. You've seen me play. That has been running through my mind for days. It's all timing. We do that now we could be shooting ourselves in the foot. <br/>We weighed the pros and cons do. We work with Wendy and take out an Eric or a Gavin. Eric is going to be a threat at the merge. We might not be able to get him out physically. Do we take our hit while we have Wendy. What kind of game did you come in hoping to play? What kind of people do you want to play with? <br/>Play with? <br/>Yeah, like, I mean, we could go for one of the boys. <br/>If that's something you're interested in. <br/>Like if you guys say, yeah, and I say new york it's not  like --  We wanted to do something like that, it would be now. <br/>Because there's three of us, right? <br/>We have the think on it. <br/>Wendy can't make a decision. It is incredibly difficult to get even an opinion out of her. And if you can't give an opinion when you're neck is on the line  and it's four original tribe mates against you, I don't know how I can work  with you for the rest of the game. The decision for me is a big decision, because it is forging an  alliance for me, but nobody has seen any game yet. <br/>We're good? <br/>I don't know who these people are as players some the idol  is always factor for me, and I'm walking around with my bag, making sure I  got a good little spot for my hidden immunity idol to nestle before going to  tribal, and there's an envelope. Someone has sent you the advantage in the form of a secret extra  vote. When it's time to vote, use the parchment to cast the second  vote. If you're clever, nobody else will know you voted twice. The last time this vote can be used when there are seven people  left in the game. The extra vote extends to a tie and revote. Oh, my gosh. Someone in the game is looking out for me, and I want to know  who it is. Because that's someone who is on my side. This extra vote changes everything. I mean, do I use it now and knock out Eric? Or do I save it post-merge and use it when the numbers get  funky? <br/>It's about to get real. <br/>I'm not good with power stuff. I'm used to playing from behind. I don't know how to play when I have cards in my hand. When I have the royal flush, I don't know what the hell to do. I have alliances starting. I feel good with vick, but I almost don't know what to do when  something somewhat positive happens in this game. Like I have choices to make with big things, and I feel like  that means I'm going to be voted out tonight. But maybe that's not the mentality to have. Every time I try to do something in "Survivor,"  something goes wRong, like maybe I have to have a little faith that maybe  just a little bitty thing can go right. <br/>Jeff: If you don't yet have a torch, grab one we hide you,  dip it in, and get fire. Part of the ritual at tribal council, because in this game, fire  represents your life. And when your fire is gone, so are you. So, dwaffen, you can often get scenes of how tribal will go  based on the mood of the tribe right after you get back to camp from losing a  challenge. What happened when you guys got back? <br/>The mood was pretty dang relaxed whenever we got back. So I'm curious to see what tonight holds. <br/>Jeff: Aubry, does that mean nobody talked? Everybody just knew what was going to happen? <br/>Absolutely not, Jeff. Everyone is always talking inch this game you have to be a talk  ahead, otherwise you're out before you even realize. <br/>Jeff: Victoria, Aubry says, yeah, there was talking. <br/>Aubry's absolutely right. There were definitely conversations that I was in. I'm just hoping that everyone didn't get into their own heads. <br/>Jeff: So Wendy, you're an obvious consideration tonight  for the simple reason that these four have been together from the beginning. <br/>Yes. 1,000%. <br/>Jeff: And yet you're still smiling. <br/>I feel like people are more confused than anything about  my game play. They're just like, who plays the way you do, right? But I don'tãI know, I just feel like if I were to walk down and  get my torch snuffed, why be sad about that? I made it here. <br/>Jeff: Aubry, one of the most brutal parts of  "Survivor" is the fact that somebody is typically on the bottom. But if you're with a group of four and there's a fifth, does it  shift that dynamic a little bit? <br/>I think everyone is trying to suss out more than just  their alliances, like who do they connect with on a game level, who speaks  the same language in the game. When you find a black cat to your witch in "Survivor: Edge  of Extinction," it's a perfect halloween night. It's like hocus-pocus, abracadabra, you can find that person at  any point. <br/>Jeff: Have you found your black cat? <br/>I'm hoping I found my black cat or my black cats. <br/>Jeff: Gavin, the other thing that sticks out in this group  of five is Aubry, the only returning player in this group. What's a positive of having Aubry? <br/>I think she's brought advice. That's one of the big things for us, and I think me and Aubry  have connected on a personal level. I don't see her as a returning player as much as someone that I  can trust down the road. That's one of the reasons I was attracted to her from the  get-go. <br/>Jeff: So Wendy, experience is a positive that Aubry  brings. What's a negative? <br/>Well, I don't think Aubry brings any negatives. She's just the nicest person ever. <br/>Jeff: Wendy, is it hard for you to separate the game from  personal? <br/>Yeah. It's hard transition between normal life to this game that is  just like you have to just drop all your morals down. I found the transition very hard. I don't think I have made it completely yet. <br/>Jeff: So Gavin, where are we in the game right now with  this group? <br/>I think us four, we're just getting started up the roller  coaster. Wendy has already went down a couple hills and she survived, but  I'm basing my vote off who I think is going to benefit me the most and who  has my back for the days to come. <br/>Jeff: Eric, do you gee with that? <br/>Yeah, I know I've had moments where I thought, am I  getting duped tonight? Could this be how my game ends? But at some point you have to trust the people that you trust,  and I think we'll forge it in fire tonight. <br/>Jeff: Aubry, this may be a case where it is a very easy  vote. No surprise, no blind sides? <br/>I can sometimes be an overthinker, but sometimes things  are more simple than they seem. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Wendy, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. First vote, Aubry. Wendy. One vote Aubry, one vote Wendy. Aubry. That's two votes Aubry, one vote Wendy. Fifth person voted out of "Survivor," Aubry. That's three, that's enough. <br/>You guys are unbelievable players. <br/>Jeff: You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Wow. Wow. Damn. <br/>Jeff: Aubry, the tribe has spoken. Good luck, guys. <br/>Thanks, aub. <br/>Kill it. Wow. Oh, that's an easy decision. No-brainer. I woke up and none of this is a dream. I got burned real hard last night. I truly was blind sided in epic fashion with an idol and an  extra vote in my pocket. Like j.T.-style embarrassment. I am completely in an utter state of shock. And it's hard to know how to play when you don't even know what  the ending is. You don't have information. You're with angry people, and you don't know if you're playing a  game or in a big waiting room, but I never give up. For me as soon as it hits the rock bottom, that's my favorite  part, because I know it can only go up. I thrive on pulling myself up from the bottom, and that's what  I'm going to do. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. Kama and lester getting your first look at the Manu tribe. Aubry voted out at the last tribal council. <br/>Oh, my God. Wow. <br/>Jeff: Joe, what do you read into that? First returning player out of the game? <br/>Obviously the Kama stRong is no longer so stRong. <br/>Jeff: All right, guys. Ready to get to today's reward challenge? For today's challenge, you're going to leap over a series of  tables. You'll then pull a will every, dropping sandbags. You'll then work together to get those sandbags to the finish  and throw those sandbags at a target until you drop a flag. First two tribes to drop both their flags win reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Please. <br/>Show it to me. <br/>Jeff: First tribe to finish, coffee, tea, pastries,  cookies to celebrate with back at camp. <br/>Oh, boy. Wow. <br/>Jeff: Second tribe to finish, a little smaller, still  nice. Iced coffee and cookies. Last place, nothing but another day back at camp with whatever  you can scrounge up. Kama, you have one extra person whom are you going to sit out of  this challenge? Aurora, take a spot on the sit-out bench. Everyone else take a minute to strategize. We'll get going. All right. Here we go. For reward, Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, go go,. <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Jeff: Over the tables is the first part of this challenge. <br/>Come on. <br/>Go underneath if you. Can it's easier. <br/>Jeff: You got some sunnies getting skinned up. I can hear it. <br/>Come on, come on, come on. <br/>Jeff: Start untying those knots now. <br/>Go. <br/>Jeff: Victoria, Lauren, and Julia untying knots. <br/>Good job, Julia. <br/>Jeff: Lauren is whipping through those knots. <br/>You got it, Lauren. <br/>Jeff: Julia doing a great job for Kama. <br/>Good job, Julia. <br/>Jeff: Julia is through. You're good. Lauren is good. Victoria is good. We are very tight right now. <br/>Go, go, go, go. <br/>Jeff: Two people at one end, the other two tossing the  bags. <br/>Come on, guys. You got it. <br/>Jeff: You have to have all the sandbags in your bin. <br/>Come on, Julie, come on. <br/>Further guys, further. Further, further, further. There you go. <br/>Jeff: The closer you get to your tribe mates, the faster  they will get them in the bins. <br/>I got these, I got these. Look over there. <br/>A couple more. Go, go, go. <br/>Jeff: Got to get them all in that bin. <br/>Almost done. <br/>We're done. <br/>Jeff: Kama has all theirs. You're good. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: It's going to be Joe throwing for Kama. <br/>Nice. <br/>Jeff: Once again Joe out of the gate starts knocking those  targets. <br/>Faster. Come on, Wardog. <br/>I got it. Don't yell at me. <br/>Jeff: Lesu still working. Manu still working. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Jeff: An early lead for Kama. <br/>Yeah, Joe. <br/>Jeff: Get the last one in. <br/>Jeff: Lesu has theirs. You're good. Gave within a nice hit for Manu. And another. <br/>Go, go. Higher. <br/>Come on, Wardog. You got it. It's okay. <br/>Jeff: "Survivor" is tough, man. Nowhere to hide. <br/>WRong way. <br/>Jeff: If you never threw a banal, it's going to show. <br/>Let's go, Joe. You got this. <br/>Jeff: Joe with another hit. <br/>Nailing it, Joe. <br/>Jeff: And another. And another. Joe is on fire. <br/>Let's go, Joe! <br/>Good job. <br/>Jeff: Gavin now starting to get the hang of it. <br/>Good job. <br/>That one on the right. <br/>Yes, Joe. Yes. <br/>Jeff: Joe drops first flag for Kama. Gavin drops the firsting from for Manu. Lauren now in for Lesu. <br/>Yes, Lauren! <br/>Jeff: Lauren trying to keep Lesu in it. <br/>Keep going, Lauren. <br/>Jeff: But it's a showdown right now between gave inane Joe. <br/>One more, one more. <br/>Jeff: Joe very close. <br/>You got it. <br/>Jeff: That does it. Kama wins yet again. A big reward. We are looking for one more. Lauren trying to keep Lesu in it. <br/>Someone want to go? <br/>I can come in. <br/>I can come in. It's up to you. <br/>Jeff: It's going to be Wardog back in. He was completely ineffective. <br/>Come on, try it. <br/>Jeff: Gavin can do it with this toss right here. <br/>Slow down. You got time. <br/>Jeff: Gavin does it for Manu. Manu wins reward sending Lesu back to camp with absolutely  nothing. All right. Kama, the winning streak stays alive. Victories in seven out of eight challenges. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp, and enjoy your reward. Manu, second case, not quite as much, but in this case, any  victory is sweet. Cookies and iced coffee waiting for you back at camp. Grab your stuff, head back to camp, enjoy. Lesu, got nothing for you. <br/>I think the Kama tribe is on Joe's shoulders. The dude wins everything. I'm just jealous another tribe has basically had a two-week  vacation. It's just so frustrating that I want, that and I don't have  that, and there's nothing I can do about it. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Everything you wanted and more? <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Kama stRong! <br/>It feels a little bit at this point like I'm expecting  that we will win the challenges. And I know I shouldn't expect that, but it's hard to even  imagine us losing at this point. Joe, you won that challenge for us. <br/>I just worry that it's going to put a bigger target on my  back, so I'm going to feed you all to protect me even more. <br/>I'm appreciating this right now and I want you to know how  much I appreciate this. At this point, I'm pulling the wool over Joe's eyes. He's the biggest target in this game. He knows he is. And I keep just pretending that I'm going along with him, but  short term to have Joe on our tribe right now is a huge benefit. <br/>So Aubry, I think they saw the merge coming and they  decided to take out a returning. <br/>It broke my heart a little to watch Aubry go. <br/>Seeing Aubry go home, it was definitely a telltale sign  that these new players are seeing us return-ies as threats. Strategically that really hurt my game, because I fell like I  could really trust her. It's really hard when you want to come back and play this game  that you love so badly, but you also know that you're at a disadvantage as  soon as you hit the mat. You have nowhere to hide. You have no... You got no one to rely on. You don't. But it makes you appreciate all the people you do rely on at  home. I'm so blessed to have so much love, and I appreciate all my  people, my family. You have to take all that and you have to use it as fuel. You have to remember that when you think you're going home, when  you think you're out on the outs, when you think you have no one that wants  to work with you, that's the challenge is to how adaptable are you really? How much can you go beyond what you think you're capable of? Because if you have a mindset where you no longer have options,  then that's probably where you're at. And I don't want to be there. I like to do well in challenges. But we have to be super careful. It's going to be easier to put targets on us. <br/>Do you think there's bad blood on their side that we're so  stRong and they just might try to take us out? <br/>Absolutely they're going to. <br/>The other tribes have seen us be a really stRong group of  five, and if first thing I would want to do is take out that group of five,  split it up, take out some big threats in the game. So if I can make everyone feel like they're a big threat, maybe  we can all unite. <br/>Let's be real, you're beautiful and smart, med student,  you know this game really well and you've been killer in challenges. <br/>Don't say all, that Joe. <br/>You know they're all thinking it. I don't think any of us are part of their plan, or if we are,  it's temporarily. <br/>Yeah. <br/>People are easily threatened by someone who can win a  couple challenges and so we have to stick together. We'll go far. Because I'll win the immunities and we get to decide where we  want to go. <br/>When you start hearing Joe saying that you're a threat,  it's like, oh, crap, like if people see me as a threat, that is going to make  my game a lot harder once we do get to a merge, so I'm definitely  anticipating having to adapt and rearrange some things to stay in the game. <br/>Joe is amazing again. <br/>Oh, my God, what must it be like to be him? <br/>I really think we should take advantage of this low tide. There's crabs down. There maybe crab legs for dinner. I don't know. <br/>I'm down. I need something. <br/>We lost. Yet again. And it's so frustrating. It's not even that we're losing, it's that we're losing, and we  come back to this crappy-ass beach that has no food, a crappy shelter. We're sleeping in the mud. It's 24 hour days of just hell, absolute hell. I literally never cry at home, and I've cried like four days in  a row now. I'm dying, like literally walking up and down I was blacking  out. <br/>Really? <br/>Yes. I'm so hungry, but the rice makes me so sick. I can't function. <br/>Girl, you and I are like the only people doing things like  super physical in the challenges. I need you. <br/>I just need that merge right now. <br/>We've had almost no food for days. And we're all feeling it. Especially Lauren. <br/>He found a crab. <br/>Pull that thing up. <br/>He's really on there. <br/>The idea of fishing I think is counterintuitive because we  need to save our calories and energy for these challenges. <br/>How are they getting away. But at least David still has life. You know? Lauren is kind of like giving up. Maybe she's the one to go next. I know that Wentworth is good with it. But to pull it off, I need David. <br/>I feel very torn right now. Lauren is somebody that I've been close to from day one. But her mind is not in the game. <br/>Right. <br/>I can see her just twimping. I need someone who will ride or die. Let's just say we lost Lauren, are you with us to the end, ride  or die? <br/>I don't think I have a choice, but yes. <br/>Hopefully we just win and whatever. <br/>I understand that at some point I might have to vote out Lauren. She's literally wasting away. However, Wardog, who is a psychowhen it comes to number  crunching and flipping alliances, he's almost scaring me now. I don't know if I want to work with him. The thing is I feel like with him I just agree a lot. <br/>That's what I do. <br/>He doesn't want to hear your opinion. He really wants to bark an order at you and have you go on with  it. <br/>It's a dictatorship. <br/>Wardog is playing really hard, flipping back and forth,  and it's really annoying. He does nothing at camp he spends most of his days strategizing  and crunching numbers. Also he sucks at these physical challenge, and all of that is  putting a huge target on his back, which is great with me. <br/>We have to do whatever is best for us. <br/>I'm with you. When the game started, I wanted to vote out Wentworth, but now  I'm working with the person who I thought was my biggest adversary out here,  but if that's going to get me to day 39, then that's what I'm going to do. <br/>What's up? <br/>I got more info. This morning we found a basket with five new maps. They look the same as before, except there's a bunch of holes. So I'm assuming that means there's something else to find. <br/>Can we lessen the level of paranoia this time and no one  take off? <br/>No promises. <br/>We get the map and everyone starts following it. I'm a newbie in this Edge of Extinction language. <br/>All right. I'm going to go ahead and go. <br/>I don't know what the hell is going on. But they seem to know if you fold it and something points,  you're going to find an advantage. <br/>Is this thing even out here? <br/>There's mad scramble up top. I was able to figure out first map. But the second map was much harder than I thought. I'm looking everywhere and then finally it's like, oh, my gosh,  it's on the beach. <br/>What I figured out is all the holes line up to one hole. When you layer that on top of the other map, it puts it right  next to the mast. Oh, come on. I was so sure it was there. I dug and dug, but apparently I was at the wRong spot. <br/>I know Devens is good with maps. So I'm thinking maybe he's just off a little bit. Then I think when it's super low tide, there are all these rocks  showing themselves, so I start walking by the water to see if maybe it was in  there. What is that? Freaking insane. <br/>This entire time I have needed a breakthrough, and then  all of a sudden in the sea water I found this. Chris, he's got it. <br/>Thank you, jesus. When the time come, penalize your biggest threat by assigning  these maps to them. This is exactly what I prayed for. Chris has been getting the best of me. This is going to let me put a little curse on Chris. Apparently we're going to have some kind of competition, and  this could help myself get back in the game. I needed it. And thank God that I got it. I'm just pissed because I said, what do you have. But I didn't touch it first. <br/>What the hell, Reem? You gave it to someone else. <br/>You think I gave it away? I'm not that stupid. I wanted that. The rules are the rules. Those two get on my damn nerves. You just accused me of giving away an advantage. Do I have complete idiot written on my forehead. <br/>I don't even know what to say. <br/>You just said I gave it to him. Don't you tell me I gave something away. <br/>Well, you point at it and he picks it up and runs away. <br/>You got the biggest mouth in the whole country. You're the one who said I gave him the advantage. By saying that, you lit off a volcano, bro. <br/>It is a disaster here. It truly is the most dysfunctional family I've ever met. <br/>I don't need zero. <br/>Then why are you talking about it? <br/>Because you're getting on my [bleeped] nerves, and it's 12  days of listening to the bull [bleeped]. And I'm done with it. <br/>The worst part of it all, no one knows how long this train  wreck can last. That's a scary situation, because people are legitimately losing  it. <br/>Reem, that's all --  [screams]  Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. Let's get to today's immunity challenge. First things first, got to take back the idol. Thank you. Thank you. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to climb a ladder and then  maneuver a bag attached to a rope through a bamboo frame. You'll then use the ball inside to drop the cage door. Sprint to the finish to solve a "Survivor" slide  puzzle. Kama, you have one extra person. Who you going to sit out? Aurora sat out at the reward challenge. Ron, take a spot in the sit-out bench. Oh, one extra thing. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>Oh. <br/>Jeff: This challenge only the first tribe to finish wins  immunity. The two losing tribes go to tribal council. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>Jeff: I'll give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. <br/>Wow. All right. Here we go. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! Get up that ladder, and then start tracing that bag along the  ropes to get it out of the bamboo frame. <br/>Try not to let it --. <br/>Jeff: You can't get ahead of the bag. You're only as slow as that person working on the bag. It is Kama in the lead, which is becoming predictable story in  challenges this season. And then Manu and lester side by side. It's going to be Kama out first with their bag. Aurora is down. Here comes Julie and Joe. They've got to untie it now. <br/>Come on. <br/>Go. <br/>Jeff: Manu coming down. Got to untie their knots. It is now Lesu in dead last once again. Julia working on the knots. You're good! Joe now going to start untying knots on the bag, trying to  release that monkey's fist. <br/>Up on the platform. <br/>Jeff: Manu, you're good. Going to be Gavin untying knots for Manu. Lauren's got it. It's going to be Wardog now. <br/>Come on, Joe. <br/>Jeff: Joe has that monkey fist. Now he's looking to drop it in that hoop, which will drop that  cage door. Joe drops the cage for Kama on his very first toss. <br/>Good toss. <br/>Jeff: Gavin tosses. He drops his cage. Go, Manu. Two people on the puzzle now, going to be "Julie &amp; Julia"  for Kama. <br/>You got this, Wardog. Give the rope some slack. <br/>Jeff: Manu is over. It's going to be Victoria and Eric. <br/>Here we go, Wardog. Wardog, no, no, no. <br/>Jeff: You got to stay on it.ÃI  No! <br/>Okay. Sorry. <br/>Jeff: Wardog has not had a lot of success. Wardog's got it for Lesu. Awkward but accomplished it. Get over that cage. It is David and Wentworth for Lesu. Everybody now working on the puzzle. Julie going to step out. Joe and Julia in now. <br/>Okay, Joe. <br/>I got it. I got it. I think I got it. <br/>Jeff: This puzzle could take a very long time or if you  know your way around a slide puzzle, you could get this very fast. David thinks he has something. Lesu has been on a losing streak of epic proportions. <br/>Ready? <br/>Jeff: Can Lesu pull out a victory right now? <br/>Jeffrey? <br/>Jeff: Kama thinks they have it and they do. Wow. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Joe and Julia solve it for Kama. Kama wins immunity sending Lesu and Manu to tribal council. Once again Kama wins immunity. Nobody going home. Nice work. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. All right, Lesu, Manu, tonight both tribes will come to tribal  council together and vote one person out of the game. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>Going into tribal tonight, I'm like panicking. There's four Lesu and four Manu. We could find ourselves at a tie and going to rocks. I have gone to rocks before, and as a fan, it's exhilarating. As a player it's nauseating. Strap yourself in, everybody. It's going to be chaotic. <br/>The challenge went horribly. Kama wins again. With the added twist that both tribes will be going to tribal  council. Wait for it. Drum roll. Together. Which is an interesting problem, because if we go to a 4-4 tie,  everyone votes again. If no one changes their vote, we draw rocks. Anyone can go home. <br/>First of all, I think the best thing we could do is stick  together as a four. We can't possibly split. <br/>Are you all willing to draw stones? <br/>That's the thing. We have no alliance. So if we hit Lauren or Wardog, I think they would flip on our  side. <br/>I think we have a really good shot in being able to sway David,  because the Lesu tribe, at least from when I was part of that tribe, they  weren't loyal to each other, and he doesn't have the numbers to survive the  merge, so I'm hoping that David realizes that he's on a sinking ship. <br/>I think that somebody will do it. <br/>I don't think they would all go to rocks. What returning player is going to come back for a third time and  be willing to go to rocks? <br/>I think right now the fact that they have two returning  players is an advantage for us. You don't come out here two, three, times to get sent home  before the merge by a rock. So in terms of this crappy situation, I feel like our side could  possibly be slightly better off. <br/>If we will all go to rocks, I think all we have to say is,  you can believe us or not, but we're willing to go to rocks tonight. We don't think your tribe is. Roll the dice? <br/>I think that's our best bet. <br/>Everything is a gamble tonight. But I'm a big fan of this game. I've been imagining myself in these exact situations for years. You don't imagine yourself in the easy tribal council vote. You think yowfers in this situation, going into tribal council,  probably going to go to rocks. That's what makes a person like me at home want to play this  game. It's this, tonight, but is it scary? Yeah. I could go home tonight. No question. Do you think they're more likely to put votes on you or me? <br/>I have no idea. <br/>I wish I knew. <br/>And you'll go to rocks? <br/>I guess. I'd be willing to do that. I don't want to go to the next stage without you. <br/>Of course. We're in it together. <br/>You're my man. <br/>No one wants to go out with rocks. That's the big fear in this game, but I did sign up to play  "Survivor." I feel like that's what I'm doing tonight. So it feels good, but I'm also going to be crapping bRicks. I have 100% trust in Eric and Victoria. And after last tribal council, Wendy is with us 100%. I'll draw rocks for one of them. I hope the God they'd do the same for me. <br/>This is going to be a huge move either way, but I think it  can work. I just want to make sure we're all on the same page. <br/>No question. <br/>The whole thing tonight could come down to drawing rocks. We just all agreed that we're all down for that. I'm not. I'm kind of willing to put my vote wherever to keep me in the  game. If I feel like I need to betray an alliance to move myself one  step further in the game, I'm going to do it, because I can find an in  somewhere else. Don't ever trust me, man. I don't know if anyone has figured that out yet.ÃI okay. So here's the thing. If I were them, I would stay four stRong. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Try and flip one of you. <br/>Correct. <br/>Right. <br/>I want to take out one of the big guy, but I feel like the  last person they would think we would take out would be victorya. What do you think? <br/>Four votes on Wendy, right? We vote, one of them might be like do, you want the draw rocks  for Wendy. They might flip on Wendy right there. <br/>Once again, Wardog didn't thereon what anybody else had to  say. He tries to overpower people. He's got his plan, and that's that. But to be honest, Wardog is right. Wendy is not an original Kama member. So hopefully we have to revote someone will flip and help us  vote her out. <br/>I think I should go over to Wendy and say vote for  whatever name we want her to vote for. <br/>It goes 4, 3, 1...  I think they're going to vote for me, because they're  going to think Kelley or you has the idol. <br/>I think she would be the logical vote. <br/>We just can't crumble. That's the thing. We cannot. We have to go in there four stRong. <br/>I'll go to rockings. I'll go to rocks. <br/>Me too. <br/>I've done it before. <br/>This plan makes me really nervous. I didn't come this far just to go to rocks, but Wardog always  has his own agendas and nobody can even have an input. So I'm pissed. I'm so close to making the merge, and this could ruin  everything. We got to merge tomorrow. I'm so hungry. <br/>Okay. We need a ton more firewood for this. <br/>Just to keep us going. <br/>I got like 15, 20 minutes to dry this wood out. <br/>Okay. <br/>I'll go down to the beach. <br/>He doesn't contribute at all. It's crazy. <br/>He's so obviously like plotting. <br/>He's totally plotting. <br/>We have a good plan tonight, however, I'm worried to death  about Lauren. She isn't well. All she talks about is the merge, food, merge, food, merge,  food. I can't work with someone like that. So I'm like do, I really want to go to rocks for this girl? I'm not so sure. Let's go explore. However, the Manu tribe might be targeting me. But if I can find an idol that will give me tremendous power. <br/>Wardog? I can in the believe it. <br/>He literally does nothing. <br/>It's insane. <br/>Like where is he? <br/>He's probably looking for the idol. <br/>Wardog disappeared. He's not helping at all. He's not contributing at all. He goes off into the jungle. Wardog is creating a war. I guess that's what war dogs do. He's being divisive. We need to be united. <br/>I'm going to go look for it. <br/>Let's go look I guess, right? <br/>Where were you? <br/>Down by the beach. <br/>We couldn't find you. <br/>You weren't looking hard enough. <br/>I want to find the idol before Wardog. He's a schemer and manipulator. He's already calling the shots. And with an idol, he's just going to get more and more powerful. It shouldn't be this hard. It shouldn't. This is ridiculous. I have no idea. And then I look up in the tree, and, bing, it's just sitting  right there. <br/>Let's go on the other side of camp. <br/>I'm going the stay here. In "Survivor," you never give up, because this game is  always changing. And neg that tonight is such a crazy tribal potentially, having  that safety is huge. <br/>I'm perplexed. <br/>Tonight's tribal council is huge. Kelley and I have idols. I have no idea what I'm going to do. <br/>It's not worth going home. <br/>I know. <br/>Tonight the Manu tribe is most likely targeting me or Wardog. Everyone is banking on the fact that they're not going to want  to go to rocks for Wendy, but if they stay stRong, rocks will determine who  goes home. <br/>I really don't want the draw rocks. Would you go to rocks for Wardog? I'm not going to rocks for Wardog. <br/>If we go to rock, it's a 1-6 chance you go home some if  they're voting for Wardog, I'm going to flip. But I can see them going after me, so I got to decide if I'm  going to play my idol or not. Tonight is going to be a lot of on-the-sly decisions. You just never know what's going to happen. <br/>Jeff: All right. Two trikes gear to vote out one person. Victoria, any time there's a twist involving tribal, it can be  unnerving. Did you feel a different sense at Manu this afternoon? <br/>I would say the main difference was there were no side  conversations. It was one large conversation because we got even tribes here. It's four against four. If we're not all on the same page, we're immediately screwed. <br/>Let's talking about the Lesu tribe. Lauren, was it similar to Manu in that you all got together and  said, we have to be united. <br/>We didn't even have to talk about staying united. We knew we were going the stay united. We're a very stRong four that genuinely has been through so  much. <br/>Jeff: Wardog, pretty interesting, four from one tribe,  four from another, but only one going home. <br/>It's kind of crazy, because when you first said only one  tribe gets immunity, I felt that pain in my stomach, but when you find out 1  out of 8, preparing for the gun knight at the o.K. Corral. I have my wyatt earp. That makes me doc holiday. We have our plan. We're going to stick with each other. It's going to be fun  The tRicky thing is they don't know us in a tribe in the  same way we don't know them. So it's hard to put a lot of weight into anything that's said. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth, this really is "Survivor"  warfare. <br/>I think this is definitely a battle tonight, but we are  four stRong. We would welcome anyone over here with open arms. <br/>Jeff: Gavin is -- gaferren, Wentworth is saying, join us  right now and we'll change the game. <br/>That's a great speech. I would like to extend the same thing to you guys, because we're  going to stick stroke to our gun, as well. <br/>Jeff: Wendy, one other interesting aspects is you have  some insight. Did the tribe look to you and say, what do you think? <br/>That's essentially what happened. I feel like I'm having a flashback on my first part of the game. So it's like I'm basically in the middle. <br/>Jeff: David, that's interesting. Wendy didn't say, I used to be with them. She said, I feel like I'm in the middle. <br/>Yeah, that's really good to hear. I think it was unfortunate that the swap kicked Wendy out of the  group of people, but we still consider her part of the tribe. <br/>All of a sudden. <br/>Jeff: We love you, Wendy. We always did. <br/>That wasn't the sense when she received Wendy. She felt on the outs. We welcomed her with open arms some we're not concerned about  her feeling in the middle. <br/>Jeff: So David, you had to discuss the idea of a true  deadlock tie in which you would force a rock draw. <br/>Yeah, and, you know, I'm someone who has been to rocks. I go to rocks for my people. If it has to come to rocks tonight, then that's exactly what's  going to happen. Nobody here is afraid to do that. We trust each other. <br/>Jeff: Victoria, when you hear a veteran say, oh, I will go  to rocks, check my history, does that have any weight with you? <br/>Not really. I find it really hard to believe you would come back into this  game again and again to have your fate be put into rocks if you had another  option. So I get it and I respect it, but I don't think you played  "Survivor" twice, three times to go home on a rock before you hit  the merge. <br/>Jeff: Eric, you're nodding, you agree. <br/>"Survivor" is fun, but it's not that fun. I don't know if I would do it three times to go home on a rock  draw. <br/>Jeff:  Wendy, I would like to talk to you for a quick second. <br/>Sure, let's go ahead. <br/>Jeff: Is that it? You guys ready to vote? <br/>Yep. We're ready. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Wentworth, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. First vote, Wendy. Lauren. Wendy. That's two votes Wendy. Lauren. We're tied, two votes Wendy, two votes Lauren. Wendy. That's three votes Wendy. Tied again. Three votes Wendy, three votes Lauren. Wendy. That's four votes Wendy, three votes Lauren, one vote left. Lauren. We're tied. Here's what's going to happen. We're going to revote. Lauren and Wendy, you will not vote. Everybody else you can only vote for Lauren or Wendy.Ã±r  everybody else you can only vote for Lauren or Wendy.Ã±r  I just want to say one thing. Once we merge, we just met you. This is our first conversation. <br/>I know, I know. <br/>Our group is going to cave. <br/>This is like the worst cocktail party ever. <br/>Jeff: Okay. Wentworth, come grab the urn. I'll go tally the votes. I'll read the votes. Wendy. Wendy. Two votes Wendy. Wendy. Three votes Wendy. Sixth person voted out of "Survivor: Edge of Extinction,"  Wendy. That's four, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Sorry, Wendy. Sorry. <br/>It's cool, it's cool. <br/>Can you call me big Wendy? <br/>You're amazing. <br/>Jeff: The tribe has spoken. <br/>Yeah. Bye, guys. I get a hug. <br/>We'll miss you, Wendy. <br/>We really well. [applause]  Jeff: Time for you to go. Get out of here. Cheeseburger and shower. <br/>One of a kind. <br/>Wow. I'm not good with the path. What's this? If you do not want the play anymore, follow this path and your  adventure will end. Oh, yeah, where am I going?
