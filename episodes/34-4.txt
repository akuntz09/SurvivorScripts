<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor": Andrea, for the win [ cheers ] Tavua  won their second immunity challenge and there was a twist for the two losing  tribes. One group where you will vote out one person.  Oh!  Jeff: At tribal council, it was utter chaos.  What the hell is going on here, Jeff?  Jeff: Oh, my gosh! J.T. Leaked Nuku's plan. And Tai used it to his advantage.   I think i'm going to gift idol to pretty lady.  Jeff: Saving the Mana tribe. Sierra, does not count. And sending Malcolm  home. 16 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?  How is it Tai gives Sierra the idol out of all those people there.  I don't know.  Why Malcolm?  That's what I’m want to know.  When I’m said physical threats, I’m started getting nervous.  Culpepper said you were good.  What else did you tell culpepper?  I didn't tell culpepper about who we were voting for. Tribal council went  tonight about as bad as it could. I’m told Brad Sierra was in trouble and to  play the idol if he had it. &gt;i thought it was an easy opportunity to get  rid of Sandra. Unfortunately, they voted out our strongest player, Malcolm. Malcolm  was my closest friend on the tribe and I’m have to smooth it over as best I’m  can and move forward.  Somehow, that name slipped because how would Tai, of all people, give it to  her.  And culpepper, when I’m got scared, when I’m thought culpepper had an idol.  They can't really prove what I’m said, so i'm going to defend myself 100%.  Take it to my grave. Because i'm here to win $1 million.  And Tai turned around, and culpepper says Sierra, and Sierra went like this  to him and took it.  I told him he was save.  J.T.'s hands are all over this. This is J.T.' J.T.'s dirty deed, if he knows  how I’m am, i'm going to turn around and send his ass packing right behind Malcolm  if I’m can. He crossed me. It's payback time.  Trierk was really tough one. My biggest fear right now is, you know, if we  lose an immunity challenge, I’m should be the one to go. So i've got to get  my hands on an idol. You know, as muchaise hate it, that's the truth. You  know, as muchaise hate it, that's the truth.  Lo and behold I’m found a clue. And it says, "to find your safety  requires intersecting landmarks around your beach. Search casually or in  desperation, your protection is in reach." that's great news. I've seen  the trees with marks on them. So with everyone away from camp, a couple of  minutes, i'll have it. Cover this up. Lo and behold, I’m found the idol and  no one knows. It's perfect. I'll never tell a soul, and that idol will keep me  in this game. Beautiful! Yes!  Jeff: Come on in, guys! Tavua getting your first look at the new Mana tribe.  All here.  Jeff: Still fully intact.  What the hell is going on.  Jeff: Tavua getting your first look at the new Nuku tribe. Malcolm voted out  at the last tribal council.  Wow.  Oh, my gosh!  Jeff: Ozzy, why is Malcolm significant?  Malcolm is a huge, huge player in this game. And for him to be gone at this  point, it definitely changes the game.  Jeff: All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward challenge?  Yes!  Jeff: Each tribe will use a grappling hook to retrieve a bow. You'll then dig  up a bag conTaining a ball. You'll balance the ball on the bow through a  series of obstacles. You place the ball at the finish, then it's back to the  start, where the grappler will hook a bag conTaining a handle. You'll dig up  another ball. You'll balance the ball on the handle through the same  obstacles. Once both balls are at the end, one person will race to complete a  slide puzzle. First two troob tribes to finish reward. Want to know what  you're playing for?  Yes!  Oh!  Peanut butter and jelly!  Jeff: Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, plus cookies and milk.  Oh, my God!  Jeff: Second tribe to finish--  my mouth is watering.  Jeff: You're not left out. Just a taste. P.b.&amp;j.  Oh, my God!  Jeff: Last tribe to finish, nothing. Tavua, you have one extra member,  sitting somebody out. Who is it going to be? Troyzan.  Jeff: Troyzan, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, give you a minute to  strategize. And we'll get started.  I will be quick on the slide puzzle. I’m do it on my phone all the time.  You pick and put me somewhere.  You pick it? What are you best at?  Dig the bags.  Okay.  I have a really good sense of balance.  Okay, then you balance. You're plate, you're bow, you're digging.  Okay, got it.  Jeff: All right, here we go. For reward of peanut butter and jelly, cookies  and milk, Survivors ready? Go! It's going to be sara, garner and Ciera as the  glap grap lers. Your first job is hook that bow. Sarah a little short. She  has to figure out how to use that rope. Ciera's got the bow on her second  toss. Nice job! Tai out to dig up that first ball. Sarah has her bow hooked.  It is Cirie now digging up the ball for Tavua. Tai has the ball for Mana. It  is going to be Hali now trying to balance that. Here goes Hali in the lead. Hali  heading over the first obstacle. She drops, gotta go back. Varner still  trying to hook that bow. Varner hooks for Nuku. It's going to be Michaela  digging up for that ball. Wow! Michaela whipping through the sand! Michaela  record time with the ball for Nuku.  Keep digging, Cirie.  Jeff: Finally has the ball for Tavua. J.T. Going to give it a go. There goes Hali,  making her way over that first obstacle. Ozzy does not hesitate, like he grew  up doing this in the jungle. Opening up a lead for Tavua.  Take your time, oz. Just take the lead, buddy.  Jeff: Ozzy is through the first obstacle very easy.  Nice.  Jeff: Ozzy now on that second obstacle. Ozzy's good!  Yes, Ozzy.  Jeff: Get that ball to the finish. Grab the next bag. Tavua out to an early  lead. A nice toss by Sarah. Sarah quickly snags that bag for Tavua. Cirie  digging up the second ball. Halley's good!  Good job, Hali!  Jeff: Moving on to the second section. J.T. Is good through the first part of  this. It is Hali and J.T. Now. J.T. Drops, gotta try it again. Hali now  getting it. She is locked in this time. And it worked. Hali is through. Drop  the ball! Go, Mana! Ciera now trying to snag that handle.  You got it.  Jeff: Cirie still digging for that ball. Ciera has it. Tai looking for that  second ball. It is now Tai and Cirie digging for the second ball.  Got it!  Jeff: Tai quickly finds the ball for Mana, and just like that, Mana is now in  the lead. Cirie finally has the ball for Tavua. It is now Debbie on the  course for Mana with the handle. Andrea now on the course for Tavua.  Slow down. There you go.  Jeff: Andrea is through the first stage very quickly. Debhad the lead for Mana,  but she has lost it. J.T. With a big fall. Debbie continues to struggle.  Go, J.T., go, baby, go. Come on, J.T.!  Good job, J.T.  Jeff: Andrea, you're through. J.T., you're through! Go, Nuku, go, Tavua! Tavua  now can start working on the slide puzzle, and Varner now can try to hook  that bag. Varner hooks the bag for Nuku. It is now Michaela digging again.  Can she get it as quickly as she did last time.  Yes, I’m can, Jeff.  Jeff: Yes, she can. This really opens up the door for Tavua again and gives Zeke  a lot of time to start on that puzzle. He put himself in the hero spot. Can  he deliver? Debbie, finally through the first obstacle. Aubry is going to  feel the pressure right now. Debbie drops, she has to go back. You're good, Aubry.  Aubry is through the first section. It is now Debbie and Aubry. They played  together for first season. They are now against each other. Can they catch Zeke?   Go, Aubry, go!  Go, debgle no, Debbie's got to go back.  Yes!  Jeff: You're good! Aubry's good! Go! Nuku can start working on their slide  puzzle. It's going to be Sandra on the puzzle talking on Zeke. Mana was in  the lead, but they are dead last now as Debbie drops again. She has lost a  lot of time.  Stay calm. Stay calm.  Jeff: Tavua getting closer to that victory.  Yes!  Jeff: Zeke thinks he has it. Zeke wins reward for Tavua! We are now look for  second place. It is now Sandra working on the slide puzzle for Nuku as Debbie  continues to try to get through this obstacle for Mana. Debbie fails again.  &gt; i know.  It's too slippery.  Got it!  Jeff: Sandra thinks she has it, and she's right! Nuku wins reward.  Good job, baby.  Jeff: Mana comes out empty-handed.  I'm sick of losing, guys.  Me, too.  Jeff: Tavua, congratulations. Come grab your reward, pb &amp; j, cookies and  milk. Nuku, come grab your reward.  I hope they're even numbered because we fight over odds.  Jeff: Mana, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp.  Once again, we lost. If we don't strategize, it's a dictatorship with Brad  just telling people what positions they're going to take.  Another then you balance.  The bottom line is, i'm pissed.  Good job, team.  Cheers to Tavua!  Wooo!  Good job, guys. Good balancing.  Tavua, who started literally from scratch, has somehow banded together, and  we're just, like, dominating stuff now.  Peanut butter and "Survivor--" that's like gold.  But I’m don't want to be overconfident. In the event that something crazy  happens, I’m need options.  I don't know. This is-- I’m feel like i'm--  has anyone talked to you?  No. Hey, you're the only person I’m trust on this tribe.  Okay.  At this point, Troyzan and I’m are out against me and the other four. The set  four, that's stupid. That's boring. I’m don't like it. Let's grow up. Come  on. If you say anything about us talking, you're a dead man. I'm a dead  woman. I'm completely playing this game like a criminal th time. I’m know how  criminals lie to me. So I’m know how to lie to these people. I'm looking for  an idol, but you better never turn your back on me.  Why would i?  Okay, i'm just telling you.  I have an idol, and Sarah doesn't know anything about it, and she says she  wants to work with me. So it would be a huge plus in my game not to play my  idol right now, so if I’m could work with Sarah and keep my idol.  Good on that?  Yes, 100%. I’m mean, that would be... The golden ticket. I’m mean, that would  be... The golden ticket.  Debbie, talk with us.  Debbie!  Come here.  Why don't the four of you talk, make decisions, and tell me, and when you  vote me out, why don't you give Hali--  Debbie, come here.  Is she acting?  No, I’m think she's mad. I’m don't know.  Today at the challenge, Hali rocked the balance beam. But Debbie couldn't get  over it, and we lost the peanut butter. And she was adamant that sheeblgd  balance, but now she's real angry, so I’m don't know what she wants. The only  predictability of Debbie is that she's unpredictable.  You okay?  Yeah, i'm fine.  We're worried about you.  Don't be. We're fine. I'm [bleep]. I'm at the bottom of this totem pole. I've  got nothing to say, as far as he's concerned. So why don't I’m just shut the  [bleep] up and listen to what i'm told. So I’m will. Brad treats me with very  little respect. Brad is used to being in charge, whether it's a football  team, a law firm, his family-- Brad is in charge. Here's what it comes down  to-- it's a total lack of respect for me. Whatever you want, you get. He's  got his head so far up your ass, his eyeballs are sticking out your mouth.  Brad?  Yeah. If Hali wants to do the balance beam, even though she cost up peanut  butter and jelly by dicking around for 10 freaking minutes and I’m zipped  across the balance beam in 30 seconds, that means you don't respect me. It's  nauseating, frustrating, and i'm pissed! Whatever you want, you get. If I’m say  something, it's totally ignored.  So Debbie's explosion about Brad centered on her not being heard in the challenges.  I’m don't really see the argument. I’m think Brad is great in challenges.  He's a leader. He pulls people together. But she thinks that i'm the  princess. I’m get whatever I’m want. And she's the ghoul that gets nothing.  We're cool. It's him. I'm so [bleep] sick of him.  Brad?  Yeah.  I know he doesn't show much respect for you.  None! None! None! Not a little, none!  I'm trying to comfort her, but watching Debbie get upset like that, I’m got  really scared. I’m think debsejust different. She's like a crazy lady.  The princess Hali, whatever she wants she gets.  Debthinks she's an expert in everything, but Hali is better than her, as far  as agility and the challenge.  When you're totally not respected for what you say, why don't you just shut  the [bleep] up and not talk. I’m get it. It's cool. I'm good. I’m don't  explode in anger. I’m take it out in my workout. It's why I’m look like this,  and have an eight-pack, because I’m don't get pissed. This is it. I'm  venting. It will be over. I'll make a strategic, calm, decision. And it may  be him. I'd rather die fighting than live on my knees. So it makes perfect  sense for me to make mr. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Brad, my next target.  Debbie, I’m apologize.  I don't even think you know you're doing it. I’m don't. I’m think that you're  so used to being in charge of things, that you don't realize it's not a  conversation, at least when it comes to me, it's a dictatorship. And the  funniest thing to me, I’m had your bark man. I’m was loyal to you completely,  like, utterly. And you crushed my heart! Why not take out Brad next? He's a  wanker. May the best man be left standing. Tbring on, Brad, bring it on. Âª âª  they're making coffee.  Is there enough for me to get leftovers, put seven drops of coffee and a  scoop of sugar. Seven drops of coffee and a scoop of sugar? Sure.  Seven drips?  Ignorant, that's ignorant, that's what that is. Scoop, my ass. Ignorance. Michaela  is starting to kind of lose her bearings out here. She's a little out there  already, unstable. Yesterday the challenge was a little bit hard for me to  handle. No one wants to baby sit out here when we're trying to survive. And  today she wants seven drips of coffee and a spoon full of sugar. That blows  my mind.  Whoa! I’m like it!  So J.T. Was annoyed that Michaela was using one tablespoon of sugar for a  tiny sip of coffee. So I’m had a sweet idea. And I’m said, "i'm just  going to go ahead and eat the rest of the sugar." and that's what's left  of the sugar. I'm going to finish this sugar off and add fuel to the fire  because he'll think it was Michaela. The only other person here that use the  sugar was J.T. And Michaela. So I’m knew J.T. Would blame Michaela for the  sugar jar being empty.  Sugar's gone. I’m know who has been eating it, who has been eating it spoon  fulls tie time. Michaela.  Where did it go?  In her mouth. Licked clean.  I believe you. The sugar disappeared.  I wonder how it disappeared so fast.  J.T. Thinks it's Michaela, and it's 100% Sandra.  I don't eat sugar so--  i don't either. Somebody does.  I wonder who been drinking all the coffee with sugar in it.  I've been drinking a lot of coffee.  It must be y'all two. Because Sandra don't drink it.  It's no secret, hone bun. It's all right.  J.T. Was trying act like I’m took the sugar. I’m was just so angry. And the  problem with me is the more I’m try to hold something in, the worse it gets.  And in this environment, it's like hold it in. Thoald in. Hold it in. But I’m  wanted to kill him. I’m have to, like, look at, you know, what-- yeah, what's  best for me. And I’m used the idol at tribal. So i'm thinking there's an idol  out there. I’m want to be productive and go look for an idol. At least I’m feel  like i'm in charge of my game. At least I’m feel like i'm in charge of my  game. [ laughs ] oh, my God. I’m found another clue. I’m found another clue.  Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity  challenge?  Yes!  Jeff: First things first, Andrea. Gotta take it back. Once again, immunity is  back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to race up and over a  tall wall. You'll then work together to roll a massive wooden cube to a post.  You'll then unwind a ring of keys, use the keys to unlock a chest full of  sandbags. You'll then transport the sandbags across a balance beam. When you  get to the finish, you'll use a giant slingshot to knock down five targets.  First two tribes to finish win immunity. Losers, tribal council, where  somebody will be the fifth person voted out of this game. Tavua, you have one  extra member. Cannot sit out the same person in back-to-back challenges. Troyzan  sat out in the reward.  Cirie will sit out.  No, no, you think? I’m think you should be balance beam.  No.  How strong are you?  I feel like I’m should do it.  And I’m feel like I’m should do it.  All right, you guys decide.  Whatever.  Debbie, Debbie let's all get a good attitude.  I have a bad attitude. Because i'm sick of defending myself. I’m took  gymnastics for 10 years and made it across that beam. Did anybody notice it  took me for two minutes. She was on there for 10, with all coup dew respect.  I'm not doing it. Now i've decided.  Jeff: Here we go. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! Gotta get up and over. Mana  flying through it. Everybody over.  Other side, Debbie.  Jeff: Mana quickly moving that cube. There goes Troyzan, Sarah, and Zeke.  Come on.  Varner last for Nuku, and it's Aubry, J.T., and Sandra.  Come on, one more! All right, get up.  Jeff: Mana gets there first.  One more.  Get up!  Jeff: Ciera is up for Mana. Sarah pops up for Tavua. It's J.T. For Nuku. Now  you've got to spin that ring of keys until it's free.  Come on!  Jeff: Ciera has it. Head up, haily and Tai. Tai now going to start working on  the lock. J.T. Has his. Ciera has hers. It's now Michaela working on the  lock. Ozzy working on the lock for Tavua, and Tai for Mana. Now it comes down  to how quickly can you work through those five keys to find the right one?  Don't force it.  Jeff: Michaela has hers. Start heading over. You have to carry 100 sandbags  across the balance beam. If you drop a bag or you tbawl falloff, like Michaela,  you have to go back. Varner going to give it a go. Andrea and Ozzy for Tavua.  Varner drops. Gotta go back.  Breathe!  Jeff: Hali is across for Mana. She's good. Tai's got to go back. Here comes Andrea  for Tavua. She's good. Michaela struggling to hang on. Ozzy is good! Michaela  pulls it out! Tai falls again.  Yeah, well, i'm glad we didn't send the gymnast. Really, I’m seriously am.  I'm so sick of having to defend myself.  Jeff: Here comes Andrea again. She's good. Hali drops. She's got to go back.  Here comes Ozzy again with two big handfuls.  Good job!  Jeff: Once you have all of them--  there's one outside.  Jeff: Andrea has the last of them for Tavua. Tavua has been very impressive  on the balance beam. They've got all their bags, and a massive lead.  Here we go! Here we go!  Jeff: Go, Tavua. Tavua can now start firing sandbags at their targets. Ozzy  launches for Tavua. And just misses. Here comes Hali with more bags for Mana.  Michaela and Varner still working sandbags for Nuku. Ozzy launches again.  Just misses low.  This is the last.  Jeff: Tai has last of the sandbags for Mana. You're good. Come up, guys. Go! Nuku  has all theirs. Get up, start firing!  Somebody else.  Jeff: Sarah now in for Tavua. Here goes Ciera for Mana. There it is! Ciera  scores the first for Mana. Mana now in the lead with one. Ciera launches. Ciera  connects again. That's two! Sarah connects for Tavua! J.T. Knocks one down  for Nuku. Culpepper going to come in now for Mana. Sarah going to come out.  Here comes Ozzy. Culpepper connects for Mana! Mana now with three!  Ozzy, you're on it. You got it.  Jeff: You can see Ozzy and J.T. Feeling the preser pressure culpepper looking  for number four. He's going deep. Culpepper hits the furthest target. That is  four for Mana. They are one away from winning immunity.  Keep it going!  Jeff: Ozzy connects with number two. Culpepper does it for Mana! Mana wins  immunity, safe from tribal council! We're looking for one more! Ozzy hits the  third target for Tavua. Tavua now with two left. Nuku has got to pick it up.  And he's got it. J.T. With the second target for Nuku. It is now 3-2. Tavua  looking for number 4. Just mussing. J.T. Connects. We are now tied 3-3. Nuku  is back in this. Both tribes with two targets left. J.T. Hits target number  four. Ozzy hits target number four for Tavua. We are tied again, 4-4. Gotta  hit it square!  Go, go, go, go!  Jeff: J.T. For the win. No. Ozzy. Ozzy connects for Tavua! Tavua wins  immunity sending Nuku to tribal council.  Amazing.  Jeff: Mana, congratulations. Immunity is yours. Nobody going home from Mana. Tavua,  congratulations. Nobody going home from Tavua. Mana, Tavua, grab your stuff.  Head back to camp. Enjoy the night off. All right, Nuku, see you tonight at  tribal council, where somebody will be the fifth person voted out of "Survivor:   the last time I’m played, the challenge that was tribal council and sent me  home was slingshot. Today was slingshot. The same thing can't happen to me  twice. I’m hope. I’m should have-- I’m should have done better switching it  out the whole time.  So we lost the immunity challenge. The God are not loving Nuku right now. I’m  don't even know the name of this tribe. Like, that's the point that we're at.   I can offer a lot, a hell of a lot more than Michaela can.  I feel like Michaela has to be the next person to go, and for J.T., we came  into his camp. He's done his job. He's been a part of us.  I've been thinking about it, y'all, it's better for us not to have Michaela.  I'm 100 behind it.  A lot less baby-sitting. A lot less bitterness. A lot less bad energy. A lot  less cry baby. And a lot less sugar stealing.  Sugar nabbing  yeah, sugar nabbing. I’m cannot think of one reason anybody would want to  keep Michaela versus running with me.  You better not have me laughing at tribal council.  As long as I’m know i'm not going home, i'll tell the truth about it. But if  i'm afraid i'm going home, I’m will shut up.  Why would you be scared?  I think it's plain to see I’m have a lot more to offer than she does. If I’m have  to use my idol, I’m will, but they need me to win challenges. Nothing will be  better than watching Michaela get her torch snuffed. I’m think she licked it!  I’m swear!  I mean, that's it for this jar.  That's it.  This is done.  I told you, that [bleep] is crazy.  Today's immunity challenge was for J.T. To win for himself, except J.T.  Didn't know how bad he had to win. I’m need to get vengeance for what  happened to Malcolm. And I’m think that between Varner, Michaela, and i, we  make a good team. Do you think as a tribe, we could survive without J.T.?  Yes, I’m think we can.  All J.T. Has to do is get awb expree one more person, and that's not good for  us.  Yeah.  But i'm going to talk to Jeff and see what we can do because I’m trust you  more than I’m trust those two.  Yeah. Sandra, Varner, and me make three, which is enough to vote out J.T. I'm  ready for him to go home. He just irritating.  I just want you to have trust in me. That's all.  Yeah. The only thing that might happen to go out of my favor I’m is eithe Sandra  or Jeff Varner deciding that they would rather vote for me than vote for J.T.   That's how you're going to get to the end with Sandra. Because all I’m know  how to do is get to day 39.  Okay, so here's the deal. I’m was just talking to Michaela, because J.T. Has  a thing for her, and now he's not going to be quiet about it.  Right.  He's going to just leave her alone.  Right.  Between me, you, and Michaela, we can take out J.T.  Tonight, I’m am in a perfect spot because I’m can choose to vote with Sandra  and Michaela and vote out J.T. Or I’m can go with J.T. And Aubry, and vote  out Michaela. I'd like to go both ways at the same time, please. What if J.T.  Has an idol? Anybody can have an idol in this game, but I’m want to keep  winning. So it is get rid of an attitude problem or get rid of a big threat.  Jeff: All right, last tribal council, Sandra, you came in here with the  numbers, six versus five. Malcolm is blindsided. You're down to five. What  happened when you got back to camp?  We blamed J.T. We thought that he might have given it away talking with  culpepper. But somebody leaked the name because how would Tai know who to  give the idol to?  Jeff: J.T., you had to feel some pressure because you kind of started that  ball rolling?  No doubt about it. And I’m felt really guilty, because the last person I’m wanted  to go home was Malcolm. I’m was hinting around at culpepper, are we safe? I’m  said you're safe. I’m didn't say you all are safe. It wasn't sabotage. It was  more like I’m gave too much information and got myself burned, too.  Jeff: Michaela, what happens now to the tribe dynamic?  I would say we went from being a tribe where everyone was on the same foot to  being a tribe where you have someone who thinks he's running [bleep] all the  time.  Whoa. [ laughs ]  Jeff: So you've got to be talking about J.T.  Of course.  Jeff: J.T., does this surprise you, or are you guys going at it?  It doesn't surprise me at all. I’m think it's obvious, everybody is tired of  baby sitting. So camp life is tough. I've never been so excited to be at  tribal council.  Jeff: Sandra, do you know what J.T. Is talking about when he says "camp  life is tough?"  well, their feud started over the sugar because J.T. Uses sugar for his  coffee, and there was no sugar left, so he thinks Michaela actually licked  the conTainer where the sugar was. [ laughing ].  This is for real.  That's how stupid he is. What would I’m put my tongue in a sugar jar for?  Jeff: So it's been on since then.  Exactly.  Jeff: So, Sandra, how do you base a vote tonight knowing there will only be  four of you left? Because who you vote out is just as important as who you  keep behind.  We're going to keep our strongest player in the game, and with him, we're  going to move forward.  Jeff: So, Michaela, that's a clear reference to J.T. I’m don't think we need  to pretend, right?  No, I’m don't know why people are acting like i'm stupid all day. It's such  an insult to my intelligence. I'm not surprised, but it's like, dang.  Jeff, I’m have to say, we're tired of baby sitting. She lays in that damn  shelter all day long and says, "will you give me seven drops of coffee  and a cup of sugar?"  being funny. Pause, has anybody ever seen me wash dishes?  No.  She has washed dishes.  Has anybody ever seen me help prepare the food?  She has prepared the food.  Has anybody seen me deliver food to anyone else on a plate?  I have seen that.  Shut the [bleep] up.  I evaporate seen any of those, Michaelaa.  Like I’m said, he speaks for the whole tribe.  Jeff: Varner, does J.T. Speak for the whole tribe?  I think more often than north he does.  Jeff: Aubry, does J.T. Speak for you? Are you tired of Michaela?  Yeah, I’m tried really hard and i'm at a loss at this point.  Jeff: Sandra, does J.T. Speak for you? Are you tired of Michaela?  J.T. Doesn't speak for me as far as his issues with Michaela, but the I’m do  listen to what J.T. Says. He makes valid point about us moving further in the  game.  Jeff, some of us aren't quite game changers. Some oferous just filling space.   Jeff: Wow. Aubry, you seem distressed by this. Is it because you're worried  about the tribe? Is it because you just don't like conflict? What is it?  Um... Yeah. I’m genuinely like Michaela. I’m have a lot of respect for how  she runs her life, that she is an intelligent, independent female, but it's  clear from this trieblg that we have a quality of life issue going on here.  Jeff: Varner, how complicated is tonight's vote or is it at all?  It's incredibly complicated. I’m mean, there's arguing going on at camp, and  there's arguing going on at challenges. It's uncomfortable. It's very  uncomfortable.  Jeff: Aubry, just since we've been here at tribal, you have flip-flopped on  which way you want to vote?  This vote for me has become abundantly clear.  Jeff: very clear to you, Sandra? J.T.?  Yes, sir.  Jeff: And Michaela, clear to you?  It's not like it matters.  Jeff: All right, it is time to vote. J.T., you're up.  Got a lot to learn, kid.  For the record, you don't think for me. You don't speak for me. I’m ain't  your little friend.  Queen stays queen. Adios.  Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you  want to play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are  read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the  tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Michaela. J.T.  One vote J.T., one vote Michaela. Michaela. Two votes Michaela. J.T. We're  tied, two votes J.T., two votes Michaela, one vote left. Fifth person voted  out of "Survivor: Game changers," J.T.  Damn.  Jeff: You need to bring me your torch.  Tell Malcolm you sent him home, too.  I will.  Jeff: J.T., the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go.  Damn, you guys are good.  And I’m didn't steal the sugar, either. I’m don't know where it went. You  took the sugar!  Way to go.  Jeff: Well, this is the level of game play you expect in a season call the  "game changers." the only rub, is as we just saw, it's only a  matter of time until the game is played on you. Grab your torches. Head back  to camp. Good night.  Jeff: Next time on "Survivor": No one can let their guard down  everybody drop your buffs. Because the twists are never ending.  What a crazy game.  Jeff: You are going to exile island. One castaway is left stranded. And a  former Survivor makes a surprise return.  I got a little overconfident in myself, and I’m didn't bring my idol to  tribal council, because I’m didn't think I’m needed it. I’m made a very, very  foolish mistake. I’m just let myself down basically through this whole  experience. I’m think i'll always love the game. I’m just hate how I’m played  it. I’m had a chance at $1 million and I’m blew it.
