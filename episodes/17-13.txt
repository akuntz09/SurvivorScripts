<br/>(elephant trumpeting) (gorilla  hooting) (elephant trumpeting)  Jeff Probst: 36 days ago, these 18 Americans arrived in Gabon, Africa. Welcome to Survivor: Gabon. They were surrounded by endless savannah and miles of jungle. Their every move was shadowed by dangerous wild animals. They were as far away from civilization as a person could possibly be. <br/>I see why they call it the Garden of Eden. <br/>Probst: Red tribe, you are Fang. On the first day, the 18 were split into two tribes. Yellow, you are Kota. From the beginning, the yellow tribe looked as though they were going to run  away with the game. Kota wins immunity and fire! Kota wins reward! (cheering) Kota wins immunity once again! They won nine out of the first 11 challenges. Kota, should be a fun afternoon. Fang, I got nothing for you. <br/>It's hard, you know, when you see them walking away. They have everything and we have nothing. <br/>Probst: Kota was well-fed, well-rested, and confident. <br/>The best part about this is they may be completely out of the race. <br/>A tribe switch put the two Fang leaders on Kota, but just when Kenny and  Crystal appeared to be doomed, they struck back, overcoming their opponents'  strength with superior strategy. The original Kota never knew what hit them. They fell like dominoes. To add insult to injury, the powerful twosome tricked their worst enemy into  playing a fake hidden immunity idol. This is not a hidden immunity idol. (laughing)  Probst: When the fourth consecutive Kota checked out, it was a brand-new game. Now there are only five players left: Susie, a teacher, hairdresser, and mom. <br/>Okay, I want to be honest with you. I was actually going to vote you. <br/>Probst: A lot of her old tribe mates thought she was a bad strategist, but it  was her decision to flip that allowed the original Fang to go on their  improbable run. <br/>I might be riding coattails here and there when I can, but everybody's trying  to do everything they can to be that sole Survivor. <br/>Probst: She's considered weak at individual challenges, yet she's already won  a big one. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Susie wins immunity. Matty, the personal trainer. His physical strength was supposed to carry him to the end, but since the  merge, he hasn't won anything. <br/>Matty is super-irritated. You keep on winning challenges and not him. <br/>Probst: He needs to win immunity because he's still considered to be a  physical threat. <br/>If Fang takes the next immunity challenge, they're voting for me. <br/>I'd say that's accurate. <br/>Probst: Sugar, the pin-up model. She's quick to tell everyone she doesn't know how to play the game. <br/>Yeah, I'm an idiot. Ding, ding, ding...  Probst: She's been sent to Exile Island five times in a row. <br/>I'm here to break records, you know? <br/>Probst: So she's spent the least least amount of time with the others, but  she's figured out how to become the vital swing vote in several game-changing  moments. <br/>I think I'm the lady of the hour. <br/>Probst: Bob, the 57-year-old high school physics teacher, the last of the old  Kota tribe. <br/>The next one to go is Bob, so Bob should be worried. <br/>Probst: Bob has just won reward! He would have been voted out a long time ago if he hadn't gone on an amazing  winning streak. Bob scores! Bob wins immunity! <br/>Four challenges in a row. I'm 57 years old. AARP is going to call up and ask me to represent them. <br/>Probst: And Kenny, the professional video game player. If anyone can be called a Survivor, it's him. He's already survived 11 trips to Tribal Council. <br/>I have been calling the shots since day one out here, you know. I am the mastermind. <br/>Probst: He'll say anything to win and has no problem lying. <br/>Kenny acts like he's this weak, little meager guy, and he spins all these  lies. <br/>Reporter: He's furious at Bob because Bob promised to give him the immunity  necklace. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: And Kenny immediately tried to stab Bob in the back. <br/>Okay, sounds good. <br/>Is that okay? <br/>Probst: But Sugar told Bob, and the deal was off. <br/>I was just ticked because I realized he was going to whack me. <br/>Probst: At the last Tribal Council, Sugar, who had the real hidden immunity  idol for the last 28 days, finally decided to play it... ...not to protect  herself, but to save Matty. Bob kept his immunity necklace and a new alliance of four voted out Kenny's  closest coconspirator, Crystal. We're down to the final five. Find out tonight who will outwit, outplay, and outlast all the others to  become the sole Survivor. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION (theme song playing)  *  Well, I'd love to say that was a perfectly executed play of a hidden immunity  idol. <br/>Wow. <br/>Congratulations, final five. <br/>I know. It's crazy. I wasn't expecting that. <br/>Handing over the immunity necklace felt glorious. I had to send Crystal home, and I had that damn idol since the first 24 hours  at Exile, and I didn't use it to the very end and I used it to save Matty. I like, literally, have never felt so powerful in my life. <br/>You know, in the woods somewhere, here and there. You know how it goes around here, Kenny. <br/>Why don't you get your own idol? <br/>I was out of the loop tonight and I do feel a little bit betrayed. So, tonight at Tribal Council, I called out Bob about the hidden immunity necklace  and he made up a lie saying that if he thinks that I'm going, that he'd give  it to me and that wasn't part of the deal. He's not a man of his word now. You know, it's not like I don't try to get my own idol. I was pretty close today. <br/>We'll see. By announcing this whole deal in front of everybody, I think he was sort of  trying to embarrass me if I didn't stand by my word. For me, it's a little bit on the annoying side. That means all promises are off. <br/>Congratulations again, Bob. <br/>Oh, thanks. <br/>You get a lot of respect from everybody, man. <br/>Yeah. <br/>That means you're playing a really, really good game, dude. <br/>So, Kenny thinks we're in an alliance from before, and she still thinks that  Matty's in an alliance. These guys don't know anything. So I guess I'm just going to keep playing like I'm with Kenny. He's going to keep playing like he's with her, and we take them all out. Is that cool with you? <br/>I would love to be in the final three with Bob and Matty. So that means the next two people I would like to vote out would be Sue and  Kenny. But when I knocked Crystal out last night, it made Kenny maybe not trust me  so much. So I'm going to make sure that he feels safe as soon as possible before he  gets to Bob or convinces Matty of something and starts messing up my plan. <br/>Yeah. Yeah. <br/>Cool! <br/>Oh, my God. I want this one. Cool clothes or cloths or something. <br/>These are clothes. <br/>Oh, my God. I'm calling the blue one right now. <br/>Last night, I felt I got blindsided and I felt a little betrayal from Sugar. But Sugar and I went on a walk today and I feel comfortable now. I feel that Sugar has no alliance to Susie, so I think that Sugar really  wants to take me to the final three with her. <br/>I mean, either way, Susie's gone. <br/>Susie's going home. <br/>Yeah. <br/>This is not another blindside on me, right? <br/>No! <br/>Okay. (laughing)  "A tribe of many colors, red, yellow, white, black, and blue. Each of you, unique. Like warriors when you're through, an amazing chance you've got, an amazing  trip you're on, an amazing shot at a million bucks if you conquer amazing  Gabon."  It's day 37, final five. Feels great to be here. I didn't think I was going to make it this far, but we're here. We got a challenge coming up. So, we have to kind of make our own. We got face paint, and some material and beads and we have to each uniquely  dress ourselves up as warriors, so I'm pumped about that. I am really proud of myself that I've gotten this far, and I'm still going to  keep trying. I wanted to get to the million dollars. That's my goal: got to win it. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Wow, I am impressed. You guys look good. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. Matty, was it fun getting a chance to create a new character? <br/>Yeah, it's fun. I just hope my family and my girlfriend still love me when I get home after  this. I hope they don't think I lost my mind. <br/>Probst: I think the person who is going to take the most grief is Bob. Very Village People. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: First things first. Bob, once again, I will take it back from you. Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will dig under a wall, make your way across a  series of planks... which will lead you into a maze filled with Gabonese huts. Inside three of the huts, you will find bags of puzzle pieces. Each time you find a bag, you must make your way through the maze, to the  finish platform, drop the bag, and then head out to find another one. Once you've collected all three bags of puzzle pieces, you will use those  pieces to build a replica of a Gabonese hut. First person to build it correctly wins immunity, is guaranteed a one-in-four  shot at winning a million bucks. All right, we'll get started. This way. Here we go, for immunity and a guaranteed spot in the final four. Survivors ready? Go! First step is to dig a hole big enough to get you underneath that wall. Once you think that hole is big enough, pull your body through, and you're on  to the next phase. Bob is stuck halfway. Kenny trying to pull himself through. Susie going to give it a shot. Susie is the first through, out of nowhere. Susie working her way on to the planks. Kenny's now through. Bob is now through. Matty's now through. Sugar squeezing that booty through. (Sugar laughs) Sugar's through now. Everybody is now through. This is an elevated maze. Your goal is to figure your way out along these planks to get to the finish,  which will lead you into the maze of Gabonese huts. Bit of a guessing game. A lot of forward thinking. Matty falls off. He's got to head all the way back to the start. Kenny almost falls off. Nice save. Susie thinks she has it. Sugar following along. Kenny following. Susie can see the end. Susie's through. Sugar is through. Kenny is through. You have to untie a series of knots to open a gate. Sugar is first through. Susie's through. Matty can see the end. Matty trying to get back in this. Matty's now across the planks. Bob is now through his gate. Kenny's now out on the maze. Matty's out in the maze. Everybody is now out in the maze of Gabonese huts. Everybody is looking for pieces. There are 25 huts. Only three of them have puzzle pieces in them. Once you find a bag, you got to make your way all the way to the finish. Matty is the first one to the top with his first bag of puzzle pieces. Kenny back with his first bag. Susie right behind with her first bag. Bob and Sugar heading back with their first bag of puzzle pieces. <br/>Probst: Matty back with his second bag of puzzle pieces. Matty heads out looking for that third and final bag. Bob pulling himself up this steep finish with that second bag of puzzle  pieces. Sugar has her final bag of puzzle pieces. Bob has his final bag. Sugar back with her final bag of puzzle pieces. Drop the bag, open them, start working on the puzzle. Bob is back with his final bag of puzzle pieces. Sugar and Bob now working on the puzzle. Matty trying to get in on it. Kenny trying to get in on it. Susie cannot find her last bag. Win this challenge, you are guaranteed a spot in the final four. Lose, you could be going home tonight. Bob making quick work of this puzzle. Kenny working to catch up. Matty working to catch up. Sugar looking very good. Bob making a lot of progress. He's close. It's Sugar and Bob. Bob wins immunity! Five straight challenges! <br/>Where's Susie? <br/>Probst: Bob, come on over. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Probst: For the third straight time, individual immunity. You are safe once again at Tribal Council. Kenny, Matty, Sugar, Susie, tonight, after 37 hard-fought days, one of you  going home. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal Council. <br/>My goal, obviously, was for me to win, but that didn't happen. Bob, the wizard, fantastic Bob won. I don't know how you beat that guy. <br/>I set myself up so well in this game right now that I could just chill and  relax all day. And, uh, I already confirmed it, uh, today, uh, with Sugar during our walk  that, uh, if Bob wins, then, uh, it's Susie that's going to go first. So I'm not worried. <br/>Hey. I think, uh, S-Sugar is going to tell Susie that we're voting for her. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>But we're going to wait till the day's almost over, so she doesn't start  scrambling around. You realize I still haven't written your name down, dude. I'm not the type of person that would blindside you. If I was going to write your name down, I'd tell you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay? <br/>I really want to go to the end. <br/>We're there. Don't worry about it, bro. <br/>Is Kenny working you? Is he trying to... What's he doing? <br/>Not really. <br/>Is that what we're doing, is Kenny? I don't know; you guys won't tell me anything. <br/>We don't... I'm not saying anything 'cause I don't know, Susie. <br/>You still don't know? <br/>I still don't know. <br/>Usually, I know what's going on because Matty will say something to me. But no one has talked to me, so I-I feel a bit vulnerable. Like, is it me? I really don't know what I'm doing now because nobody's talking to me. I hate that. <br/>Do what you feel. <br/>Yeah, but in this game, you still have to try to get to the top. Still your goal is to try to still be aligned and trust people to get you to  at least the three, or at least the four. <br/>Well, everybody's playing for themselves tonight. There's no way to trust anybody. If you listen to yourself, I think you'll be fine. <br/>I had a little bit of a heart-to-heart with Matty. Anyway, and he's like, "Yeah, just go with your gut." You want to  believe people are telling you the truth, but, you know, sometimes they're  lying. Sometimes they are telling you the truth. It's just when to know when to believe it. But I definitely feel nervous that I could go tonight. <br/>You and, you and me are staying close to the end, no matter what, no matter  what, you and I, you and I, no matter what. <br/>I know. <br/>The final result in this game should be you, me, and Kenny. <br/>For sure. <br/>Me and Matty have an understanding that Susie goes next. But Kenny is very smart, and, um, he is dangerous to-to keep around. It seems like the further along we are, the harder the decisions get to as to  who we vote out. I still don't know what I'm going to do. To get rid of Susie would be great because I have no allegiance with Susie,  and I don't trust her. I would vote for Kenny because he's a liar, and he could manipulate Bob or  Matty. So I just have to think really hard about what should be done. No matter what I decide to do, I think Bob and Matty will vote with me. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Marcus, Charlie, Randy, Corinne, and Crystal, voted out at the last Tribal  Council. Bob, let's start with you. Five consecutive wins. Tied for a record in the history of this game. Do you feel the target on your back getting larger and larger with each win? <br/>Yes. That's why I keep working harder and harder, trying to make sure I have this  necklace on when I come here. <br/>Probst: Matty, as a competitor, there has to be a part of you that looks at  Bob with some admiration. <br/>Yeah, Bob's money, man. He's an expert at these challenges. And I don't know how he does it, but there's not even a target on his back  'cause we can't even see him he's so far ahead of us, you know. The guy is just good. <br/>Probst: Kenny, it's got to be a little frustrating. <br/>The thing is about Bob and I, we come from two different backgrounds. I mean, I'm a gamer. I usually sit in front of TV and play video games all day. I don't do outdoorsy things. While, you know, he's an outdoorsy type of, type of guy. He goes camping. He does fishing. And you know what? That's how it is. <br/>Probst: Susie, you don't want anybody to have any reason to vote you out. Are you a little concerned that 37 days in this game might give people a  reason to want to get rid of you? <br/>I want to feel comfortable, but I'm not completely comfortable all the time. So I wait till somebody comes to me and tells me something, and it can work  against me, and it can work for me, also. So...  Probst: How does it work against you? <br/>Because I'm not strategically making moves and trying to talk to people and  asking questions and finding out what's going on. So that's what makes me feel a little bit like an outsider. <br/>Probst: Kenny, do you feel, coming into tonight's Tribal that you've repaired  any damage you might have done over the last 37 days? <br/>I feel like I've repaired a lot of damage. I've made up with a lot of people, and I feel like our bonds are stronger  that way. <br/>Probst: At the last Tribal Council, there was some discussion about a deal  you had made with Bob, that if he had the necklace and felt you needed it, he  would give it to you. Did that come up today? <br/>I really feel that Bob is actually going to back down on his deal because the  deal was that if he won the next challenge, he'd give it to me. And then he said, "Only if I think you're going." Apparently there  was some small print at the bottom of the contract that you had to look at  through the magnifying glass to see so I think that he's pulling some  loopholes around the deal and trying to back out of it somehow. <br/>Well, what I didn't realize was he went back to the tribe and discussed with  people that when I gave him the necklace, that they would then blindside me. I was trying to take care of him and he was going to take advantage of me. That changed things quite dramatically. That was the small print in the bottom of the contract you forgot to read  that if I help you, you help me, not if I help you, you stab me in the back. <br/>Probst: So, Kenny, did you get caught trying to work a deal? <br/>Not really because if I felt like I was going to go that night, he'd give me  the idol, and of course who else are they going to vote for but Bob? It's not called a blindside. It's called saving me if I feel like I'm going. (laughter)  Oh. <br/>Probst: So, Kenny, you don't see any problem with taking it and then him  being vulnerable and going home. That's just the way the game goes? <br/>Yeah, that's what he said. He said he's sacrifice his life for me if that was the case. That was the deal. <br/>Probst: Do you really feel like you need the necklace tonight or do you just  want him to uphold what you think was the deal? <br/>I feel that I'm safe tonight, but I still that say we had a deal and he's not  living up to it. <br/>Probst: All right, it's time to get to the vote. Bob, you do have individual immunity. The necklace is always yours to keep or give to somebody else. <br/>I think I'll keep it again. <br/>Probst: All right, you cannot vote for Bob. Everybody else is fair game. Susie, you're up. <br/>I don't know if this is really going to be a blindside or not. It could be me going home. I guess we'll see. <br/>Susie, I'm really proud that you got this far. I hope you the best. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Kenny. Susie. One vote Kenny; one vote Susie. Kenny. Two votes Kenny; one vote Susie. 14th person voted out and the sixth member of our jury: Kenny. That's three. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Kenny, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Have fun. <br/>Probst: Time for you to go. Another blindside and now we are down to four. The end is near, the game, far from over. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Definitely game over for Kenny. And just like in a video game, sometimes it doesn't go your way and you lose. I thought I did extremely well in this game. I was playing a lot of people and in the end I got played myself and I hope  for them the best. They got me good. <br/>Yeah. Because it's a reality check. This is it. It's all going to depend on who wins today. <br/>This is the last thing you can do to change your fate, basically, the last  challenge. <br/>Today's day 38 and it's huge. We'll probably have to do an immunity challenge today, so the only way I'm  going to be able to save my butt today is I have to win. It's almost a given that Bob will win. Bob is the wizard and he's capable of pretty much of anything. <br/>Oh, if I win, I'd vote Bob off. It's crazy how Bob's winning like that. Just boom, boom, boom. If I don't win, I know I'm toast. I'm just nervous because today is going to seal our fate and I look at Bob  and Sugar, and I can see their confidence. It isn't just luck. He's pretty skilled. But there's always a chance that myself or Matty could pull it. It may be slim, but I still have a shot at it. But if I don't win, I really feel strongly that I will be the one going home. <br/>Hey, Sue, go get them. <br/>Matty went to get tree mail. <br/>Here we go. "Congratulations, final four. You have done what 14 of your fellow tribesmen and women could not. Today you will honor their memories. Go to Exile Island. There you will find the torches of your fallen comrades. At each torch, you will collect a tribal mask of those who were voted out  before you. Take them all to the highest plateau in savannah and burn them in their  honor, as they each had a part in getting you to this point. You will then proceed to your final immunity challenge." To be able to  pay my respects to the 14 that went before me is huge for me. They were all quality human beings, quality competitors. They definitely deserve respect, and I'm just honored to be a part of it. <br/>Michelle. <br/>Very first challenge, Michelle shocked me. She did pretty well. I can't believe the way she performed. I wish her the best. <br/>This whole experience is way, way harder than I thought it would be. Actually being there and shivering cold, I was surprised that I couldn't,  like, mentally overcome that. <br/>Gillian. <br/>Good old Gillian. <br/>I have nothing but good things to say about her. She was really fun. <br/>What I learned about myself is that I couldn't compromise myself in order to  fit in better. When you're happy, you're lucky, and you should be happy that you are lucky  in life. And I'll never lose that. <br/>Paloma. <br/>Nice girl. Just as sweet as could be. Really bright. <br/>Survivo has meant a lot to me, you know? It changed me. It challenged me in ways that I thought I never could be challenged. I didn't make it the 39 days, but at the same time, there is nothing in this  world that can be thrown at me that I can't conquer. <br/>Jacquie. <br/>Jacquie. <br/>She's such a nice kid, always smiling, always helpful. She should have lasted a lot longer. <br/>I would sum up Survivor as probably the best experience of my life. I think this game definitely changed me. I really appreciated being out there and having that adventure and I want to  continue that in my entire life. I want to live that freely. <br/>GC. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>That kid was classic. G-Sizzle. He had a life of suffering and he said he just didn't want to suffer anymore. <br/>By being volunteered by my entire tribe to be the leader was a very important  thing to me. But I never expected it to be as difficult as it was. It definitely changed my life in 15 days. Like, I feel that I'm a stronger person and I know who I am even more than I  did before I came. <br/>Kelly. <br/>Kelly. I think Kelly did pretty well in this game, considering her odds. She-She made it pretty far. <br/>This game has taught me so much and it made me appreciate everything,  starting from home and my parents and my life in general. And I think it's going to be with me the rest of my life, always. <br/>Ace. <br/>Ace. <br/>Wow. <br/>I feel terrible about Ace because I took him out, and I think I took him out  too soon because someone may have lied to me. <br/>He was a shyster, but he was cool. <br/>You know, I think it's daunting for a person that's traveled as much as me to  be combined with a group of people that have traveled hardly ever out of  their county, state, country, continent. I mean, it really... Gave a separation between us. You have to find common ground, and I didn't have the capacity to do that  without having a slightly facetious look on my face. <br/>Good old Dan. <br/>I like Dan. He's a good guy. <br/>Yeah, he really had a heart of gold. <br/>He said he came out here to find himself. I think he might have pulled it off. <br/>I've always been an emotional person, and I think, with this game, I proved  to myself that I have the ability to calm myself down. So, I need to take from it what I've learned and be okay with that. <br/>Oh, Marcus. <br/>Marcus. <br/>I always thought that Marcus would be in the top three. <br/>I think that playing Survivor gives you an appreciation for the way the world  really works and that there are choices that you make every day that are good. There are choices that you make every day that are bad. I'd probably stand by my decision to throw the idol away because I feel like  if it makes the game less sneaky, then that's good because I feel like one of  the things that I tried to do in this game was to not try and double-cross  people. <br/>Charlie. <br/>Charlie was a wonderful fellow. <br/>He was a great guy. Charlie was a really sweet person. <br/>I was really surprised with how, like, patient I was in the game, how I was  able to foster relationships with people who I never ordinarily interact with  in real life. And I'm hoping that when I go home, I'll be able to have those skills and  integrate them into my real life and be proud of who I am. <br/>Randy. <br/>What I liked about Randy is he never minced words. You knew where you stood with Randy. <br/>You know what I've got to say about Randy? (blows raspberry)  It surprised me because I was so hated by a good many people, but I was so  well liked by just as many people. And I have not felt that closeness in 20-something years. I'm not a dumb-ass for falling for the fake idol. The people that voted me off were the dumb-asses. People screw people and lie to people. I played this game honestly, and Survivor: Gab has shown me it's all right to  make friends and it's all right to like people. <br/>Corinne. <br/>Corinne. She certainly knew how to tell you what she thought, also. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>I've always been the kind of person that says exactly what's on my mind and  operates without a filter. And that is what is sort of endearing about me in general. And I think when you take that away, I'm just another girl who doesn't have  much of a personality. Like, just being nice isn't really a personality trait that I find  interesting. Anybody can be nice. <br/>Crystal. <br/>Good old Crystal. She was the muscle behind the mastermind. She got way far. <br/>The hardest part has been knowing that I came so close, and I didn't succeed. When you're used to being on top as a professional athlete, sometimes it's  hard to lose. But in the end, I failed. And I think, for me, that has been very humbling. <br/>Kenny, the ultimate mastermind. He was the most conniving player in this entire game. <br/>I mean, I think genuinely, his personality, he really is a nice kid. <br/>He is a sweet kid. <br/>He was a threat. He was underestimated by everybody. <br/>Being out here with random strangers actually helped me grow as a person. I really did step up for myself. I really did want to choose my own path and go with my gut feeling instead of  just staying back and being scared and I feel like I've kind of evolved that  way. Even though I didn't win the million dollars, I won more than that because I  grew as a person. And hopefully people can see the change in me because I really feel like I  have changed and for the better. (singing and playing music) * *  Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>You guys ready to get to your final immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: First things first. Bob, we'll take it back once again. For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will each have 200 wooden tiles. On my "go," you will use those tiles to build a house of cards. First person to build a house of cards ten feet tall wins immunity, is  guaranteed a spot at the final Tribal Council and you will get a chance to  plead your case for the million bucks. Losers go to Tribal Council, where we will vote out the last person from this  game. Big enough stakes? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. All right, guys, here we go. If after 30 minutes, nobody has built a house of cards ten feet tall, the  person who has the highest house of cards will win. For immunity and a guaranteed spot at the final Tribal Council, survivors  ready? Go. It is the first person to build a house of cards ten feet tall or the person  with the highest house of cards after 30 minutes have elapsed. A lot of different approaches right now. Got to make sure your base is good and stable. Ten feet is a long way up. Sugar making a lot of progress. Is it sturdy enough? Bob still working to form a base. Matty and Bob still hovering near the bottom. Susie making a lot of progress. Susie's house of cards collapses. Susie is back to starting over. Sugar at five and a half feet. With a big lead, and a precarious house of cards. Sugar loses everything and just like that, after nine minutes into this  challenge, we are back to square one. Everybody's in it. Bob has new life. Matty has new life. It's a brand-new challenge. This could be a million-dollar challenge for one of the four of you. Sugar is once again putting something up quickly. Bob getting something going. Matty continues to work very methodically. Susie gaining on Sugar. Susie now getting closer to the five-foot mark. Sugar now up at the six and a half feet. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Probst: Once again, Sugar's house of cards completely collapses. Susie now in the lead. Just past the five-foot mark. Susie loses her house of cards. Susie now starting over. Bob loses everything he had. Matty now in the lead, taking his time, building a solid foundation. Sugar once again in the lead. Up over six feet. Susie up over five feet. Matty up over four feet. Bob still struggling. To three feet. One of the most dominating forces in this game cannot get a house of cards  going. We're at 25 minutes now. <br/>We have five left? <br/>Probst: Five minutes left. You have five minutes left to build a house of cards as tall as you can,  provided nobody gets to ten feet. Sugar being careful not to knock this one over. Susie not slowing down, now up at the six and a half feet. Matty at five and a half feet, looking very stable. Bob racing to get in this at three feet. Sugar getting close to the seven-foot mark. Once again, the big question: will it stay up? Susie way up over seven feet. <br/>Oh, God. There is no wiggle room when you start to get this high. The person who has the house of cards that reaches the highest and will stand  up on its own without the aid of your hands will win immunity and be  guaranteed a spot at the final Tribal Council. Susie at eight feet. Susie with the lead, and she is sitting on it. Matty trying to close the gap. Sugar trying to close the gap. You are going to have to hurry. Your last minute. Clock is ticking. Sugar is at seven feet. Matty a little over six and a half feet. Susie at eight feet. 30 seconds left. Susie is not going to risk knocking her house of cards over. Sugar is still hovering near the seven-foot mark. Matty approaching seven feet with a very stable, solid-looking house of cards. 15 seconds. Ten seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. Susie wins final immunity, guaranteed a spot at the final Tribal Council. <br/>Good job, Susie. <br/>Probst: Susie, come on over. You won the first individual immunity challenge, now won the last. With this around your neck, you are guaranteed a spot at the final Tribal  Council. You will get a chance to plead your case against the jury. Bob, Sugar, Matty, for you three, Tribal Council tonight, where one of you  will be the last person voted out of this game, the last member of our jury. Should make for a very interesting afternoon. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. Congratulations. <br/>I did not think I was going to win this immunity. I was totally in shock that I won today. I just was not expecting that at all. I super-needed it because I knew I was going to go home today. So now I'm not going home until tomorrow. (chuckles)  This is definitely not what I expected when I got rid of Kenny yesterday. I thought that keeping Susie would be the smarter way to go because she would  never win. But that's what happens when you underestimate somebody. (elephants trumpeting)  It's been a good game, guys. <br/>You played great. <br/>You did, Bob. <br/>I wasn't expecting this at all. <br/>I don't know what to say, Bob. <br/>I really, I really thought tonight was going to be my night to go home,  honestly. <br/>Sorry, it was just like... super emotional. <br/>Hey, guy. <br/>Appreciate our time out here, buddy. <br/>Yeah, yeah. Hey. <br/>Susie won, and, I mean... that means we have to vote for Bob. <br/>You been, you been good players. <br/>You friggin' did awesome, Bob. <br/>It's obvious that Bob would win, so Susie's going to be voting for Bob. And, I mean, he knows, he knows nobody would win against him. <br/>Well, it's been a good game. It's been fun. Been a good time. <br/>I have to write your name down, Bob, I'm sorry. <br/>That's all right. I-I got no problem. As Susie always says, it's a game. I know what it is, so...  You are the best competitor out here, though, dude. <br/>I really thought for sure you were going to kick my butt, Bob. Too many times, I actually doubt myself. And I knew this time, I thought, "You can't have any doubt. You just have to tell yourself you're going to do it. You have to go in there and just tell yourself you're going to beat him;  you're going to beat him." I thought, well, I'm going to go home tonight  for sure. (chuckles): I really was. <br/>You can never count on anything in this game. <br/>Nope, expect the unexpected, I guess. I actually kind of shocked myself. Like, "Oh, my God, I think I just did it." I am the final three. That is so exciting. I'm always underestimated. I... people just think, "Like she's got a chance in hell that she'll  ever accomplish anything." I visualized myself winning it. Like, I can do that, I can hear it, it's going to happen. I did. It's friggin' insane. I was not expecting that at all. I'm, like, in shock right now. I really am. I was nervous all day. I was kind of anxious. I'm in total shock. I can't friggin' believe that just happened. Hey, Bob, will you be honest with me? I'm going to ask you a question. You have to be honest with me. If you were to go with me to the final three, do you think you'd get a lot of  jury vote? <br/>Do you want to go up against me? <br/>Do I want to? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I-I would rather you just tell me the truth so I can kind of know. <br/>There's really no point in even asking the question, you know. <br/>Well, I just, I just...  No, there's no point in asking. <br/>I just opened a crack there for Bob to... I wanted him to know that I would  have no problem, you know, taking Sugar out and bringing him with me. Had you or Bob won, I would have been going home. You can be honest with me. I mean, I would have been going home. <br/>Let's... how about if we talk about something else? We don't need.... we don't need to talk about this. You know, you know the score. We don't have to keep repeating it. Let's just have lunch, okay? <br/>He snapped a little bit at me, so I thought, "Okay, you just sealed your  own fate."  I'm just in shock. I wasn't expecting it at all. <br/>But I don't think he wants any constant reminders all day long that he lost. <br/>Don't worry about it. Just stop talking about it. <br/>Okay, all right. Apparently, I talk too much. Is it just me, or do I hear other people talking all the time, too? But maybe just, it's me more. I don't know. <br/>You-you talk a lot. (Sugar chuckles) You say everything that you're thinking. <br/>That's not, that's not good. <br/>Maybe you shouldn't say anything else about it for the rest of the night. 'Cause, 'cause it's like, I know you like to say everything on your mind. And if you keep saying, "Oh, I can't believe it. I can't believe it," it's just going to bum him out a lot more. Say it to us. Don't say it to him. Just because... I mean, I-I really love him, and I just don't want him to  have his feelings hurt any worse than they are. I really, really pictured Bob up there in the final three. If I were to vote for Matty and Bob were to vote for Matty, and Matty and  Susie voted for Bob, there would be a tie. <br/>That would be really nice. I appreciate that. <br/>Okay. That sounds like a good idea. Causing a tie is an option worth considering. I guess that would be giving Bob another chance, but I told Matty I would  never write his name down. I never promised Bob that. But to me, Bob is a father figure. I lost my dad recently, and that's probably, you know, why I-I kind of have  the feeling of love towards Bob. He's the father figure of our tribe. Oh, God. It is a tough choice because it's like choosing between my dad and my brother. <br/>Wow, this is huge. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's, like, shocking. I don't even know what to do. I'm nervous. I'm paranoid. I'm like... it's such close grasp, it's just like... I don't want it to slip  through. <br/>He knows he's going home. He's going to be by himself and try and, like, you know, meditate or enjoy  the last bit of this. <br/>I've talked to Sugar about the vote tonight. I'm going to vote for Matty, and Sugar told me that she'd vote for Matty,  which means that it may come down to a tiebreaker. I don't know whether the tiebreaker is making fire or not, but I'm betting on  it. I don't know exactly why Sugar is being so kind to me, but she has just been  an absolute doll. I'm packing my bags tonight. I might go home, but hopefully, I don't. Hopefully, um, I stay here in a ball of fire. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Marcus, Charlie, Randy, Corinne, Crystal, and Kenny, voted out at the last  Tribal Council. Susie, as of this moment, you are the only person who is guaranteed a spot at  the final Tribal Council tomorrow night, who will get a chance to plead their  case against the jury. What's the feeling right now? <br/>I'm very, very pleased and very proud of myself for getting to this point. So I-I just knew if I didn't win today, I was done. <br/>Probst: On the flip side, Bob, for the first time in a long time, you do not  have that immunity necklace, and you are vulnerable. <br/>This is probably the most uncomfortable Tribal Council I've been to in 38  days. <br/>Probst: And you got four former tribe members you were close to sitting on  the jury right now. <br/>People have said to me they didn't want me on the final three with them  because people like me. Um, I am, without a doubt, a huge threat. <br/>Probst: So knowing you're vulnerable and you're a target, what do you do in  the few hours you have between the challenge and Tribal Council? <br/>You know, there's a limit to how much scrambling I can do. There's only four of us here. And I do have a target on my back, but I'm going to duck at the last moment  if I can. I don't know how I can do that, but I'll give it a shot. <br/>Probst: Matty, was it a busy afternoon when you guys got back from the  challenge? <br/>You know what? Around camp, I didn't really feel the scrambling as much as I felt the  scrambling in my own head because when the end is so close, it's like you  don't want it to slip away. And at any moment, it can in this game. I mean, you never know what's going on in this game. No matter how much you think you know, you don't know anything. <br/>Probst: Matty, take me through your options. You can only vote for Bob or Sugar. <br/>You know what? Sugar went out a limb for me and saved me by giving me the immunity idol, and  there's no way that I could stab her in the back at this point. And I can't vote for Susie because she has the immunity necklace. So... my options are limited. <br/>Probst: Bob, you can vote out Matty or you can cast a vote for Sugar. Talk me through your choices. <br/>Uh, Matty's well liked by people on the jury. He's a-a nice guy. So I'd be better off going with Sugar and Susie. <br/>Probst: All right, Sugar, take me through it for you. <br/>I'd lose to both of them. And I love them both, so I feel like Matty's kind of like a brother. And I feel kind of like Bob is like a dad. I feel the same for them both. <br/>Probst: And you have to choose tonight between voting one or the other. Matty, how's it make you feel to hear Sugar talk about you like a brother? <br/>Feels pretty good. You know, I look at Sugar kind of like a sister. And, uh, when you go through this with somebody, you develop a relationship  with them. And if you can endure this game, you definitely earn my respect. <br/>Probst: Bob, tell me about your relationship with Sugar. She referred to you as a father figure, which is significant in Sugar's life. <br/>I realize that. I-I feel really good that I've made that sort of an impression on her. I am a father, and I'm, and I'm a, I'm a damn... (sobs, clears throat) Yeah. <br/>You're a good dad. <br/>I'm a good dad. (clears throat) I'm a father, and I'm a damn good one because I had the best  father anybody could have. So I had a great example, and I tried to follow it. I think I've done a good job. <br/>Probst: So now how hard is it for you to know that she has this difficult  decision? She has a father figure and a brother figure, and she has to choose one. She has no option. <br/>It is the cruelest situation that she can be put in, without a doubt. Uh, but she's there, and I hope she makes a good decision. <br/>Probst: Well, the time for that situation is upon us. Susie, you have the necklace. I can't imagine you're giving it up. <br/>Nope, I can't give it up. <br/>Probst: You cannot vote for Susie. Everybody else is fair game, and it is time to vote. Matty, you're up. <br/>I know in a short amount of time, Bob, you made a major impact on my life. And I, uh, truly respect the game that you've played. <br/>Hey, Matty, little love from my friends. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Bob. Bob. Two votes Bob. Matty. Two votes Bob; one vote Matty; one vote left. Matty. We have a tie. In the case of a tie, with only four people left, we go to a fire-making  tiebreaker challenge. All right, Matty, Bob, you can each take a spot at a fire-making station. You each have a flint and steel. You each have a box of fire-making materials. First person to build a flame high enough that lasts long enough to burn  through the rope stays in this game, joins Susie and Sugar at the final  Tribal Council. Loser goes home. Clear? Been out here 38 days. Making fire is a part of living out here. This challenge is on. Bob has a nice pile of magnesium. So does Matty. Matty's trying to get a spark using that husk. Getting a lot of spark, but no flame yet. Bob first to get fire. Bob has a good flame going, but a lot of that's going to go away quickly. Bob trying to hang on to that flame. (Matty coughs) Bob's flame is out. Trying to bring it back to life. Bob and Matty fighting for a spot at that final Tribal Council and a chance  to plead their case for a million dollars. Bob not giving up, trying to bring it back. Bob's brought it back. He's got flame again. Matty needs to get in this. Bob has resuscitated his fire, and he's got a legitimate fire going now. Bob doing a good job of nurturing that fire. It's getting bigger, stronger. Bob's got an inferno going right now. Flames starting to hit the rope just a little bit. Matty still struggling. Bob has burned through the rope. Bob has won this challenge. Bob is moving on to the final and will have a shot at winning this game and  the million dollars. <br/>Probst: Matty, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Well, Susie, Bob, Sugar, congratulations. You have gone as far as you can go in this game. The power in this game now shifts to the jury. Seven people, including Matty, who you had a hand, either directly or  indirectly, in voting out of this game, now hold your fate in their hands. I'll see you tomorrow night for your final Tribal Council. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>I've learned more about myself and about life in the last 38 days than I ever  have. I grew up quick. And I'm grateful to have this opportunity, and I wouldn't trade it in for the  world. (elephants trumpeting) (animals grunting)  I'm going to mark off day 39, the last day. <br/>This is it. Perfect. Oh, we did it! Woo-hoo! (clapping)  * You can do it if you try. (Susie laughs)  We got it. Day 39. That's a big day. Sugar, you want to count them? Ready? One, two, three, four, five... Day 39, and I'm still here. I-I'm kicking. I couldn't believe it. I really just kept believing. Just-just keep trying. All you got to do is keep trying, and if you just focus on that, you can get  through it. Day 39. Woo-hoo. I really just wanted to show, like, especially my son, what it meant to try. And if you just try, you can make it. And I did. I'm here on day 39. Is that crazy? It's insane. We're going to tree mail. <br/>Cool. <br/>Nice. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Cool! <br/>And batter! Pancake batter. Yay! <br/>Yes! Oh, my God, that's exciting. <br/>Oh, no mail, just this. <br/>Shall we... can you carry that and I'll carry this? <br/>Yep. <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, yes. It's day 39, baby. We're going to have us a nice meal. <br/>We just got tree mail, and it was a feast. So we had a nice brunch. (laughs)  Final three. <br/>Final three. Whoo! <br/>You guys going to be able to eat everything? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Oh, yeah. Making bacon. <br/>It's really yummy. <br/>Oh, my God, it's so good. I've come a long way, baby. It's incredible. Except for Marcus, I pretty much had something to do with the ousting of  everyone on the jury. And that's why I'm scared to death of the jury. (laughs) I mean, geez, they hate me, but, you know, what are you going to do? I might get a jury vote or two. I hope so. That'd be nice. <br/>Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. Oh, guys, I couldn't imagine having a breakfast with better people. <br/>Me, neither. <br/>Oh, it's going to go, huh? <br/>I'm building my last final gadget. And that is a, uh, fiery good-bye to, uh, the Garden of Eden. This is why my mother wouldn't let me play with matches. (Susie chuckles)  You're a bit of a pyro yourself, aren't you? <br/>Oh, yeah. We just packed the inside of the hut with pieces of the other hut, so that we  can torch it and, uh, say good-bye to, uh, Nobag camp in a, uh, blaze of  glory. Okay, Susie, let's go. Time to say good night. I still got one more major thing to do in Gabon, and that is convince the  jury that my behavior, my work, uh, my participation in this game is worth  winning a million dollars over Susie and over Sugar. <br/>Let's do it. Let's do it. <br/>Right... Right there. Right there. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Wow, look at that. <br/>Whoa. <br/>Whoo! <br/>You did a good job, Bob. (Bob laughs)  Holy crap. <br/>Look at that, how it's just coming right down. Wow! <br/>That's how fast stuff comes and goes. <br/>39 days, just like that. <br/>39 days. <br/>Done. <br/>Done. <br/>Crazy, isn't it? <br/>Yes. <br/>I am looking forward to-to going to Tribal tonight because I really want the  truth. I really think that Sugar did play a good game. She took control of the game. Her name was never written down. And that was huge. And I really need to know why Susie thinks she deserves a million dollars  over the other two people. And I want Bob to admit that he did back out on his deal. And I want him to admit that, you know, he's not an honorable person that he  said he was. <br/>I genuinely don't like any of these three people. I don't think there's much I could hear from the three finalists that could  change my opinion of these people except Sugar. You know, she's made some fairly decent moves in this game. I don't know what Bob is going to say, but one thing's for sure: I'm going to  tear him a new one. It's simply an opportunity for revenge, pure and simple. Revenge. <br/>For me, the final words I say at Tribal... It's a chance for me to be me. Right before I was voted out, I was unable to really let them have it. I would like to say the things that I wish I could have said if I wasn't on  the chopping block. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Marcus, Charlie, Randy, Corinne, Crystal, Kenny, and Matty, voted out at the  last Tribal Council. Susie, Bob, Sugar, congratulations. You have gone as far as you can go in this game. The power in the game now shifts to the jury. Seven people that you had a hand, either directly or indirectly, in voting  out of this game now hold your fate in their hands. Tonight they're going to be gathering information to help them make a  million-dollar decision. Here's how it will work: you will each get a chance to make an opening  statement, why you deserve to win this game. The jury will then get a chance to address you. Then we vote. Ready to get started? Susie, opening statement. <br/>I feel I deserve this because I came into this just wanting to try. That's all I wanted: to teach my son is what it meant to try. I wanted to teach my students what it means to try. So for me, it's very important that I succeed, just in trying. On day one, I didn't feel that confident. I was really scared. I was going up against an Olympic gold medalist, a doctor, you know, a  management consultant, a #1 video gamer, the pharmaceutical rep, the video  rep... I was going up against good people. And I'm standing here against Bob, and I'm not afraid to stand against Bob. And so that's why I feel I deserve it. Because day one, I wasn't confident, but day 39, I am very confident, and I  feel very comfortable telling you guys that. <br/>Probst: Bob. <br/>For 38 days, I'd hope you wouldn't write down my name. 39, I hope you do. I played with gusto, with my heart. I've played hard. My game strategy was to come in here and use my personality, my survival  skills, to make my life and your lives better while I was here. I don't think I outwitted you. I don't think I outplayed you. The only thing I did was outlast you, but I'd just like to say that you  people made this game one of the most exciting adventures of my life, and I  feel privileged to have spent it with all of you, and I would appreciate it  if you could toss a vote my way. <br/>Probst: Sugar. <br/>Uh, hey. I'm sitting up here because I feel like I played a perfect social game. I surprised myself in the physical department a couple of times. But, um, I had to lie, and that's part of the game, a couple of times. And I had to sacrifice some innocents and I'm really sorry. And, uh, 38 days nobody wrote down by name, but everybody thought about it. So, uh, the immunity necklace I found within 24 hours of my stay on Exile. And I didn't play it until the very end, and I think I've played a pretty  darn good game for somebody who's physically weak and didn't know what the  heck I was doing when I started. I've been a free agent the whole time. I was in Kota nine days, ten days on Exile, two different tribes at Fang, and  then the merge, so... I just was in it the whole time by myself. But I never sought out an alliance until I made an alliance with Bob at the  end to save him because I feel he deserves to be up here. And that's it. Thanks for playing. (laughing)  Probst: All right, jury, in a minute you're going to get your first chance to  address Susie, Bob, and Sugar. I'll give you a moment to think about what you want to say. <br/>Probst: All right, jury. You have waited, some of you a long time, to get your first shot at  addressing Susie, Bob, and Sugar. You can address any or all of them. Charlie, you're up first. Get us started. <br/>Hi. Uh, my first question is for the ladies. When Jeff asked us to rank each other and evaluate our peers, Susie, you were  rated as the worst of your tribe. Sugar, you were rated the second worst of your tribe. Why do you think we should vote you the top of the totem pole, now that we're  making a new peer assessment and give you a million dollars? Susie? <br/>Because I always knew that I was going to be underestimated, but I never gave  up on what it meant to try and that was my whole lesson for myself, for my  son, for my students. So, as much as it hurt to be at the bottom, I still feel that I'm still  trying. Even right now, I'm still trying. That's why I deserve to be where I'm at, and I deserve to win this. <br/>Great. Um, Sugar? <br/>I don't know. I don't necessarily think you have to vote for me, but it would be nice. <br/>Huh. Okay. Um, now, I have a question for Bob. We spent a lot of time together, and I'm curious if you feel that all of our  intimate cuddling and spooning all night long might have been a little more  enjoyable than you would like to admit? <br/>You're a wonderful person. I like you a lot. And you're nice and warm at night. I don't give a hoot. <br/>That's what I wanted to hear. (laughter) Thanks, guys. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Charlie. Crystal, you're up. <br/>Sue, if coattail riding is your strategy, bravo, because you're a coattail  rider. You rode coattails from day one. Bob, strategically, the young lady sitting next to you remote-controlled you  like a race car up and down Gabon. You need to tell me something that you thought of that Sugar didn't  remote-control you to do. <br/>Strategy-wise, I would say, no, I was riding coattails. I really didn't need to do anything differently to get where I'm sitting. <br/>And my last question is to Sugar. I think we've been aligned since day ten. I didn't lie to you, I mean, even to the littlest things. "Crystal, do I have any boogers in my nose?" I would do a booger  check. I need to know why you voted me out. <br/>Crystal, honestly, it was because of the way you talk and treat people. Even though that's the way you are, and I like it, you were bullying people. So, I know it was strategically better for you to be up here with me than  Bob, but I went with my heart, thought that you would forgive me. And I believe that you will. I believe that we'll still be friends. <br/>I ain't got nothing else to say. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Crystal. <br/>All right. <br/>Probst: Kenny. <br/>Susie, why do you think you deserve the million dollars and my vote? <br/>I know from the very beginning, I told you the reason why I wanted to play  this game. And I told you that you and I were both underdogs. I'm just an average, ordinary housewife who thought I was never going to get  to this point and I really believed it when I told you that. <br/>Okay, Sugar, I really did trust you. I opened up my heart, you know. You are the first girl I could really trust. And hopefully, my dating life isn't going to be so hard after this. But you did really scar me. <br/>I'm sorry. <br/>And it really hurt. So I want to know why you backstabbed me. <br/>Okay. I'm sorry. I had an alliance, also, with Matty, and also with Bob, and literally...  Sorry, Kenny. I thought you were a bigger threat than her. When she took the last immunity, I had totally underestimated her. I truly thought that you were a bigger threat. <br/>For some reason, I don't believe you. <br/>It's totally the honest truth. I'm sorry. <br/>Okay. Bob, now that I'm out of the game, I'm going to go back to the deal that we  made. The deal was that you won the next challenge, that you'd give me the immunity  necklace. So I want to know what happened. <br/>When I said that, I intended to do it. Assuming that when I said, "I will protect you," you would protect  me. Once I became aware of the fact that you were organizing an assassination on  me, you became the enemy. Sorry about that. <br/>That was not what I wanted to hear from you, Bob. Okay, thanks. That's it. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Kenny. Corinne. (clearing throat) (sighing loudly)  Susie, I have one question for you, and if you can answer yes to this  question, I will give you my million-dollar vote. If you get the money, will you agree to have your vocal chords removed? (laughter)  No, because I am a talker. Sorry. <br/>Okay, thank you. Bob, um... I adore you. You know that. The only qualm I have about voting for you, you are somewhat one-dimensional. I've already met nice Bob and I've played with nice Bob, and tonight I want  to see nasty Bob. Make me believe that you don't like Sugar. <br/>I can stand up and say that Sugar did things that I didn't like. When I blindsided Randy with my fake idol, I didn't feel rude about that, but  I felt horrible the way Sugar stuck it in his face afterwards. But in the last couple of days...  Don't get nice. I don't relate well to nice people. Stay nasty. <br/>I'm done. <br/>I'll take that. Sugar, you are an unemployed, uneducated leech on society. And the only thing I would vote to give you is a handful of antidepressants  so that no one else has to be subjected to your constant crying anymore, and  maybe if you got some, then it would seem a little more sincere when you are  crying about your dead father. You don't deserve the million. Thank you, everyone. <br/>All righty. Nice. <br/>Probst: Marcus, you're up. <br/>So, guys, as you know, I'm a physician, and I see people all the time with  health problems that they might have avoided had they made different choices. Now, Susie, you came to Earth's last Eden proud to be a mother and a child  educator. I'm surprised, for someone coming form those roles, "just a game"  is all it took for you to shed your obligation to be a positive role model in  the biggest game of all. And that's life. Now, Sugar, I'm assuming that your father really did pass away. <br/>Yeah, he really did pass away. You and I have something in common. Both you and I have lost somebody that was very important from our family. What I want to know from you is, will you use a portion of your million  dollars to honor your family member as I would have? And I want to know how. <br/>I never even considered actually winning a million dollars, but if I did, I  would definitely put some for lung cancer, but also for children because  that's my favorite cause, but my dad died of lung cancer, so... I don't have  any money right now. I have $50 in my bank account, but that's what I would give. <br/>We'll see if that's worth my vote. Uh, Bob, you are a parent. My own father taught me about taking responsibility for my choices, my  decisions, my votes. You're giving ownership of your choices and your decisions and your votes to  Charlie, to Corinne, to me, and what I want from you is one example of when  you chose to be responsible for your decisions while you were out there. <br/>The occasion didn't come up for me to take control. I mean, I didn't need to. You people were making good decisions. There was no point in me stepping forward and saying, "No, let's not do  that."  Okay. Well, this will be an interesting choice. That's for sure. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Marcus. Randy. <br/>Let me start with Susie. If 39 days ago, somebody had told me I'd be standing here and that you would  be sitting there, I would have told them they were crazy. You said at least once that you felt sorry for me. Just elaborate on that a little bit. If you don't know what "elaborate" means, that means tell me a  little bit more. <br/>Just the way you responded to people or the way you talked to them. And I just didn't understand that. And I just thought you're not happy. You're sad. And I genuinely really felt like I wish I knew how I could help you. It's that simple. <br/>Okay. <br/>I'm truly sorry. It was not meant to offend or hurt you. <br/>Okay, I'm done with you. Um, Sugar, the night I was voted out, you proceeded to roll in the dirt,  laughing uncontrollably. Did you not know that I was going to the jury? Did you not want my vote? Did you just figure there's no way I'm getting it anyway, so I'll make a  jackass out of him? <br/>I don't think I needed to do that because you did that yourself. <br/>That's your answer? <br/>Yeah. <br/>That's your answer for a million bucks? <br/>Yeah. You were a jerk. You were a jerk the whole time. Sorry. <br/>Okay, well... You lose, too. <br/>All right. <br/>Bob, again, same question as I gave Sugar. Did you not want my vote? I mean, it was a joke on me. She laughed...  Randy, it wasn't a joke on you. It was one of the few strategic things that I did. <br/>It wasn't strategic at all. You had the votes to get me out of the game. This is a chance right now for a million dollars, and please don't make me  vote for Susie because she is the only one that didn't laugh. <br/>I was going to use the idol. I was going to bring it back to camp and let somebody see it, think I had the  idol and protect myself from being voted off. I didn't mean to embarrass you. I apologize. The only thing I can say is, I was absolutely outraged at Sugar's behavior,  and I went back to camp and I was pissed. That's the truth. <br/>Okay. Whoever wins the million, spend it wisely. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Randy. Matty, close it out. <br/>Susie, tell me why the two people sitting next to you are less deserving of  the million dollars. <br/>Between both of them, I'm sure I have faults, too. Apparently, I talk too much and I don't keep my promises, but I know this is  a game. And so, Sugar, I really... I was very, very disgusted with what she did to  Randy. That really upset me. Even though, you know, I feel Randy can be harsh sometimes, he didn't deserve  to be humiliated like that. Bob, when I won the immunity yesterday... The immunity challenge, I was  really disappointed in Bob when he congratulated me right away, and then we  came back to the hut, and he got angry at me. He just snapped. And I was like, "Wow, he's really short-tempered." Anytime anybody's  won an immunity, I've always congratulated them. I just felt that he could have felt happier for me because I did win it. I really did try and I did win it. <br/>All right, well, good job for making it to this point. All right, Sugar, I know you created this persona of yourself that's very  innocent, but everybody here tonight knows that that's total garbage. I want you to reveal something that you did that was just evil. <br/>Kenny. I broke Kenny's heart, I feel. And I let him down. That hurt, and I'm sorry. <br/>That's all you got, really? All right, Sugar. And, Bob, basically, all I got for you, is why the two people sitting on  either side of you are more deserving of the million-dollar prize. <br/>Um, I don't think they are. <br/>All right, well, uh, thank you for sharing this crazy adventure with me. And, uh, good luck. <br/>Probst: All right, jury, you've had your chance to address Susie, Bob, and  Sugar. In a moment, you're going to make a million-dollar vote. I'm going to give you a minute to think about that vote. <br/>Probst: All right, Susie, Bob, Sugar, you've had your chance to address the  jury. Jury, you have had your shot at the final three. It is now time to vote. Tonight you're voting for a winner. The name you're writing down is the name of the person you feel most  deserving of the title of sole Survivor and the million-dollar check that  goes along with it. For the last time, it is time to vote. Marcus, you're up. <br/>Susie, you and I were friends from day one, and we are friends on day 39. Spend it wisely. <br/>You did an awesome job surviving in Africa. I'm just not sure how the hell you survive in the real world. <br/>All three of you, kiss my...  Probst: I'll go get the votes. Susie, Bob, Sugar, jury, to all of you, I say thank you for a great season of  Survivor. And I will see you back in Los Angeles for the reading of the votes. (audience cheering)  Probst: All right! Let's do it! Susie, Bob... You look nervous, Bob. (laughing) And Sugar. I've got some votes. A jury of your peers has decided who they feel is most worthy of the title of  sole Survivor and a million-dollar check. (audience cheering) Tonight, you want to see your name. Usually, votes are bad. Tonight, they're worth a million bucks. It is time to read the votes. First vote. Bob. (audience cheering) Susie. (audience cheering) One vote Bob; one vote Susie. Susie. Two votes Susie; one vote Bob. Susie. <br/>I can't believe it. <br/>Probst: Three votes Susie; one vote Bob; no votes Sugar. <br/>Ah... (chuckling) Bob. (audience cheering) Three votes Susie; two votes Bob. Bob. We are tied. Three votes Susie; three votes Bob. If this last vote is a vote for Sugar, we have a tie. It is not a vote for Sugar. Let's go in tight on Susie and Bob. The winner of Survivor: Gabon... Bob. (audience cheering)  (chanting): Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,  Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob...  Jeff: WELL, "SURVIVOR: GABON" BROUGHT US ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST  LIKABLE SURVIVORS IN HISTORY. BOB THE PHYSICS TEACHER FROM MAINE IS A MILLIONAIRE.
