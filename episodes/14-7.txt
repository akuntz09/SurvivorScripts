<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on  Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor... Survivor...  Probst: ...at the ailing Ravu tribe, Yau-Man and Earl were the only ones that  knew that the immunity idol was hidden at camp. <br/>Yau and I have an upper hand because we're the only ones that know that it's  even on this island. It's time to go hunting for crab. <br/>Probst: And they worked together to find it. <br/>I'm very excited. I get a chance to dig. I don't know for how long. <br/>Probst: But Yau-Man's search was in vain. <br/>Try again. <br/>Probst: Drop your buffs. <br/>What? <br/>Probst: Then the game took an unexpected turn. <br/>Mookie. <br/>Probst: Choosing members from opposing tribes...  Come on, Dreamz. <br/>Probst: Maybe the biggest rivalry thus far just paired up. ...the new tribes were formed. Yau-Man, who are you going to take? <br/>Stacy. <br/>Probst: Lisi, never good to be odd person out. Lisi was left tribeless. <br/>I thought this would be like "I'm out!"  Probst: So you just told these guys that you're fine going home. <br/>Now would be a good time to exit. <br/>Probst: Well, for the time being, you'll be going to Exile Island. <br/>Great, thanks. <br/>Probst: One very big decision left to make. Which group is going to live on the luxurious Moto beach and which group of  people is going back to Ravu? The fate of the two tribes was determined... Show it. ...when Edgardo pulled the orange buff of Ravu. [ cheering]  Garcon,my breakfast! <br/>Probst: At the new Moto...  This is real food. <br/>Probst: Earl, Michelle, and Yau-Man enjoyed the comforts of their new home. <br/>My world just got turned upside down and for the better. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: At Ravu...  I'm glad that there are no women here. <br/>Probst: The new tribe of strong men bonded. <br/>You want to have Anthony just get the fire going, and we'll go fishing? <br/>Probst: But Anthony was left behind. <br/>Unfortunately, I'm left back here to tend the fires while the big men go off,  and cookie is still here at the campfire. <br/>Probst: At a tense immunity challenge, the physically inferior Moto Tribe  surprised Ravu when they pushed their way to victory. Moto wins immunity! With tribal council looming...  Anthony, where's the flint? <br/>Probst: ...Anthony and Rocky were on the chopping block. <br/>I see myself really far from being friends or liking Rocky a lot, because all  he would cause is a lot of turmoil. <br/>Probst: At tribal council...  You have poor social skills. <br/>I got poor social skills? <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Anthony and Rocky faced off. <br/>You act like a little girl sometimes. <br/>This is why I don't say anything. <br/>Take the skirt off a little bit. Let's go. <br/>Probst: But Anthony was the one to go. Anthony, the tribe has spoken. 12 are left. 12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Five men, I think she'll take a step back. I think she just felt threatened by the other girls on the other by the other  girls on the other tribe. tribe. <br/>She was. Lisi will be joining our tribe today. The episode she had during the last challenge where she was like "Well,  I'm out of here" does concern me a little bit, but Lisi's the kind of  person just says what's on her mind at that moment. So I'm hoping a couple days on Exile Island will help her Exile Island will  help her recant a little bit. recant a little bit. <br/>Hey! <br/>Welcome home, baby! <br/>I'm with the boys! <br/>How was Exile? <br/>Exile, can I just tell you, it's not as bad as people think. When I first got to Exile Island, I cracked up. I literally broke down. But that's a great thing, because when you break down, you put your pieces  back together again. It makes you stronger. <br/>We thought you was going to quit on us. <br/>Whoo! Well, I mean, imagine, we're together for what, 14 days? And all of a sudden it's like... I had a breakdown. I was like, "I'm out of here."  That's cool. <br/>The dynamics in the tribe are going to get a little sticky because Edgardo  and Alex and I are really tight. And I know that Rocky and Mookie and even Dreamz might want to get me out of  the way. Let me tell you something. I reached, like, this spiritual enlightenment. Like, when you sit in one place for a long time, you start thinking, like,  deep. So I was, like, tripping, man. I was up there like...  I told you she was going to fit right in. Didn't we tell you guys? <br/>Back at old Moto, I never really had a relationship with Lisi. I didn't like her. She didn't like me. <br/>Okay, we're officially on Survivornow, guys. <br/>So she should be worried out  So she should be worried out of her mind. of her mind. of her mind. [ theme song playing] [ theme song playing]  I sleep so light. I hear everything. <br/>The new Moto tribe consists of three old Ravu, which is myself, Yau, and  Michelle, and old Moto, which is Cassandra, Boo, and Stacy. So now this new Moto is three and three, so everybody has three votes. So we're even. So... but we need to change the power here. I'm going to catch a fish. Y'all want to go down in the water a little bit? <br/>I just want to get the boat back. <br/>Well, if anything, we can just go do that, just go bring the boat. <br/>I'm setting something up with Yau. There is definitely an idol on Ravu's camp and Moto's camp. And we have an idea of exactly where the immunity idol is here, but we  haven't had the chance to go get it. <br/>Yau-Man is going to stay behind while the five of us go retrieve the boat. So this gives him a moment to look, and we'll have it. So that'll be our ace in the So that'll be our ace in the pocket. pocket. <br/>Right there. Can you see it? Can you see it? You can see it now. You can see it now. <br/>Oh! Oh, my God! This is my... this is it. This is my million dollars right This is my million dollars right here. here. I'm glad I'm not in an untying contest right now, because I would lose. The one and only immunity idol. I know there's another one somewhere in the other island, but right now, this  is the only one that exists. This is mine. This is mine. It looks good on me. It really does. I'm going to jump out of my skin here! here! Turtle. Turtle. My plan now is to let Earl know, because I owe him that much. He engineered this whole boat[1]saving  party for me. And so I agree to share the use of this idol when the time comes of this idol  when the time comes with him. with him. All right, untouched. All right, untouched. Back to work! Back to work! <br/>Yau-Man. <br/>Yau, we're back. <br/>My arms are falling off. Did you guys get the boat? <br/>No, it's too high up. We're going to have to wait for high tide. <br/>Oh, well, good try and all that. Thank you, y'all. The sun's not that hot, so I should have gone out and helped. <br/>It wasn't anything we can do. The boat is so far up on the The boat is so far up on the rock. rock. With a net, where I was at, I'll catch something. <br/>Let's see how we can untangle the net. When I first came into this game, I did not have any expectation of finding a  new friend in such a short time that friend in such a short time that I can  trust so much. I can trust so much. <br/>But Earl is different. His word was good. I would have never thought that a big, strong, black man would become one of  my best allies in become one of my best allies in this game. this game. <br/>What I initially told Yau is I will help you with the idol because I knew the  value of Yau, and I knew if I helped this guy, I could feel it that he would  actually remember that and would trust me a lot. <br/>I went at it so fast. I was digging furiously. I mean...  Yau having the idol helps because hopefully there's a power change. We'll share this, you know. If they're trying to vote me out, he'll let me know, and he'll give it to me. And if they're trying to vote him out, then he'll just use it, and so that's  the way how two people can share an idol. <br/>We'll make it to the final two if all things align, you two if all things  align, you know, Earl. know, Earl. know, Earl. <br/>Probst: Moto, come on in! <br/>Probst: Moto, come on in! Ravu, come on in! Moto getting your first look at the new Ravu tribe. Anthony voted out at the last tribal council, and this morning, Lisi joined  their tribe, returning from Exile Island. <br/>She made it. Wow. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, each tribe will use a flame thrower to launch  fireballs at three separate targets. Each time you hit a target, it will burst into flames. First tribe to ignite all three of their targets wins reward. You want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Tomorrow morning, the winning tribe will be picked up by a seaplane  and taken to your own private Fijian arcade. A little usual in the middle of all these islands to find an arcade, but we  did. So you'll have an afternoon of a different kind of game playing, foosball,  air hockey, a bowling alley. And an afternoon at an arcade would not be complete without hot dogs and beer. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: In addition, the winning tribe will send one person from the losing  tribe to Exile Island. Give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. First two throwers, it is Earl for Moto, Dreamz for Ravu. <br/>Come on, Earl! You got this! <br/>You got it, Earl! [ cheering] [ cheering]  Hot dogs, Dreamz. <br/>Hot dogs, Dreamz. <br/>Probst: When you're ready. Three, two, one, launch. Earl just short for Moto, inches short. Dreamz not messing around, connects and scores for Ravu. Ravu leads one-zip. Next round, it is Michelle for Moto, Lisi for Ravu. Three, two, one, launch. Lisi launches hard but short. Michelle just misses. <br/>Oh, good try! Good try! <br/>Probst: It's Yau-Man for Moto, Edgardo for Ravu. <br/>You got it! <br/>Yau! <br/>Show them that secret technique, Yau. They don't know. Show them. <br/>Probst: Here we go. Ravu leads one-zip. When you're ready, launch. Edgardo could extend Ravu's lead. No luck. Yau-Man with a great toss. [ cheering] [ cheering] We are tied, 1-1. We are tied, 1-1. <br/>Probst: It's Boo for Moto, Mookie for Ravu. We are tied 1-1. <br/>Come on, Boo. You got this. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one, toss. Boo with a big launch, and just short again for Moto. Mookie, dead center for Ravu. Ravu leads 2-1. <br/>That was awesome! That was awesome! <br/>Probst: Next round, Cassandra for Moto, Alex for Ravu. With a good toss here, Alex could give Ravu their first win as a tribe. Three, two, one, launch. Alex, not going to do it with that toss. Cassandra with a good toss for Moto, just misses to the right. Next round, Stacy for Moto, Rocky for Ravu. Ravu leads 2-1. Three, two, one, toss. Stacy falls short. Rocky just short for Ravu. Going to have to get some air on these things. Next round is Earl for Moto, Dreamz for Ravu. Dreamz, what are you more excited about, hot dogs or the beer? <br/>I don't drink, so I got to say hot dogs. <br/>Probst: Dreamz could win it for Ravu right here. Ravu leads 2-1. When you're ready, toss. Earl with a big toss, just short. Dreamz with a big launch. Is it enough? [ cheering] It is! Ravu wins their first challenge! Ravu wins their first challenge! [ cheering] [ cheering]  Oh, Dreamz came through, baby! <br/>Probst: Ravu, big decision. You're sending one member of the Moto tribe to Exile Island. Who is it going to be? <br/>Earl. <br/>Probst: Why Earl? <br/>He's been in Exile Island many times, so we don't want... you know, we don't  want another person to get another clue. <br/>Probst: Earl heading back to Exile Island once again. The boat will pick you up. You will return in time for the next immunity challenge. For once, Moto, I got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head on back to camp. Ravu, get your stuff. Head on out. Head on out. [ cheering] [ cheering] [ cheering]  This is what I'm talking about, reward! <br/>Whoo, baby! <br/>Finally going over that hump, getting that "w" under our belt, now  we can actually know we got this. We're going to replenish ourselves. The whole Moto Tribe is going down. We're back in this. We're back in this. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! <br/>I'll be your host for the day. Shall we go in now? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Wow. <br/>Wow. <br/>Air conditioning! <br/>Air conditioning! <br/>Oh, they got cheese! <br/>Ooh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Wow! <br/>As soon as we saw the food, it was like a feeding frenzy, it was like a  feeding frenzy, man. man. <br/>Life is good. <br/>Life is great! <br/>Great! <br/>Cheers, guys. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Cheers to Ravu, many victories. <br/>You know this. <br/>Man, I can't wait to get full so we can play some games. <br/>The question of the day is how much food can you shove in a pie hole? They're just shoving like four hot dogs in their mouth. I'm like, "Chill out, boys. Relax. You'll give yourself a stomachache."  Oh, man. <br/>Ow. [ burping]  Just to let you know, on the other side, we have a golf area. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>Nice. <br/>Cool, virtual golf. <br/>Behind you, you have a pool table. In front of you, you have a bowling alley. <br/>All right! <br/>Whoa! <br/>Strike! <br/>It's my favorite kind of scenario. I love being surround by guys. To me, being around a bunch of boys is my favorite place to be, boys is my  favorite place to be, straight up. straight up. <br/>All right, she's on my team. <br/>Lisi doesn't hold back. She's like one of the guys. She just went straight at the food, the beer. I mean, she's the type of girl you'd go to a football game, chug a beer, bump  chests, you know, every touchdown. <br/>Yeah! Hey, I'm next. <br/>Well, when I first got here, obviously, I'm the chick, so I would be the  weakest link right there. [ laughter] But after the win, all the guys are feeling good. Whoa! So they're more accepting. They've gotten to know me better, so they can see how I could really fit in  with the guys. All right, killer. No, that's a pretty swing. <br/>Everything about me is pretty. <br/>The whole dynamics of the game is just beginning to shift daily, so we'll see  what daily, so we'll see what happens, man. happens, man. <br/>It's my third time here. It's just boring, no big deal. The idol has been found, so there's no purpose of getting a clue. No one's been here as much as myself. I'm going to officially change the name to Earl Island. I'll be accepting reservations for tourism. You have a nice view of the ocean, plenty of room to lay down, good eats. Just like the finest restaurants. Yeah, this is my island. Lodging isn't very good, but it's a beautiful view. it's a beautiful view. Earl's island in Fiji. Earl's island in Fiji. <br/>Man, I just ate way too much food. Oh, god! <br/>This is horrible. What have we done? <br/>Alex? <br/>What? <br/>Hurry up, man. <br/>So two franks and another hot dog and then a brownie and a little bit of beer  to wash it all down with. And oddly enough, felt kind of sick. <br/>Oh, god! <br/>Those brownies were so good today. <br/>Oh, shush! <br/>Can we not talk about it right now? <br/>Oh, how come... listen, how come when I'm starving, right, I'm sitting on the  grass and the dirt, everyone's talking about chocolate chip ice cream. You know, now they're all rolling on the couch. "Ah, my stomach." So I started making fun of them. "Oh, I'm going to eat 19 hot dogs, and I'm going to eat 17  brownies." They were running their mouth. Now I'm full. I feel great now. Now yous all got stomachaches, and now I can't talk about brownies and stuff  that I had earlier today. That's not fair. People call me up on my own stuff all the time. I just think it's fair game, you know? And if you can't take stuff like that here, you shouldn't be here. <br/>This is terrible. <br/>I told you. Everyone's hurting. You guys better be ready for the challenge soon. I don't care. <br/>You know what? I'd rather have this feeling than have the feeling of starving. <br/>Okay, well, then suck up the stomachache and shut up then. <br/>Rocky, he just doesn't fit in with us. We're pretty laid-back guys. We make fun of each other, but to a certain extent. But Rocky takes it to another level. I think I gained, like, three pounds. <br/>Three pounds of stomachache is what you gained. <br/>Because he criticizes everybody, and he's too harsh on people, and people  don't respect that. People don't want a guy to be criticizing you all the time. That's why they have, like, bosses and teachers back at home. <br/>Listen, you've been crying about this for three weeks. You got what you wanted. You went a little too crazy too fast. Suck it up. Suck it up. [ Rocky laughing] [ Rocky laughing]  We lost the reward challenge, and it proved to us that we need to step up our  game if we want to keep this immunity idol. It's very important to each and every one of us here. Some of us, it's more important than they really understand. I mean, it's more important to Yau than he knows, because if we lose, he's  gone tonight, because he's got to be the weakest physically out of all of us. That's good. <br/>Now things are definitely looking up. I'm in an alliance with Earl, who is very strong and a very honorable man. I have the immunity idol, and if I can make it through the merge, I can go  quite far. My first priority is not let anybody know that I got the immunity idol. Then I have a really evil thought. I thought what if there is another immunity idol for them to find? So I start out making my own immunity idol out of a half coconut shell. Basically, I took a coconut shell. I paint it with a little face, and I painted eyebrows. And just in case they don't know it's an immunity idol, I put the it's an  immunity idol, I put the initials "I.I." on it. initials "I.I." on it. There are so many immunity idols running around here. I made that. I wrapped it back up. And when I see that Michelle and Stacy was falling asleep in bed, I went  quickly and buried it back in that hole. I didn't bury it very deep, so it's easier to find. So I'm hoping that someone will decide to hunt for the idol and we'll have  one too many idols running around, except I have the official one. This upcoming immunity challenge is very important to me. I'm always the target, but I do have the immunity idol. If we lose this immunity challenge, then I will have to really keep my ears  to the ground and listen to see if I am up. If I am, then I will be forced to use it, but I really hope I to use it, but  I really hope I do not need to use it. do not need to use it. <br/>Probst: How's everybody doing? <br/>Good. <br/>Good, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Let's get to it. We'll now bring in Earl returning once again from Exile Island. [ applause]  Earl! <br/>I'm back, feeling good. <br/>Probst: First thing's first, take back immunity. Thanks, Michelle. Once again, immunity back up for grabs. For today's challenge, one person will be your caller. The rest of the tribe will be blindfolded. One at a time, the caller will lead you out into a field where there are five  skulls hanging. Using a Fijian war club, you must smash a skull, releasing a bundle of tiles. Then, while still blindfolded, you must find the tiles and take them to your  puzzle board. Then race back to the start, and the next person goes. Once you've collected all five bundles of tiles, as a tribe, you have to  unscramble the puzzle to decipher a two-word phrase. First tribe to correctly solve it wins immunity, guaranteed a one-in-11 shot  at a million bucks. <br/>All right! <br/>That's what I'm talking about  Probst: Losers, tribal council tonight, somebody going home. If at some point during the challenge, you want to switch out callers, you're  allowed to do so. I'll give you a minute to strategize, and we'll get started. Here we go. Michelle is the caller for Moto, Lisi the caller for Ravu. For immunity, survivors ready? Go! <br/>All right, Stacy, you're good. Follow that rail. Follow that rail. Go, go, go, go, go. Three more paces, and you'll feel the pole. All right, slide right, slide right. <br/>Back, back, Alex, back. Back, to your left, baby, to your left. <br/>It's right above you. Do you feel it? <br/>Probst: Stacy takes the first smash. <br/>Hands on the floor. Hands on the floor. Forward, forward. By your knee, by your knee. There you go. Okay, go forward, go forward. Go forward, go forward. Go forward, go forward. Go forward, go forward. Go forward. The table's in front of you. Do you feel it? <br/>There you go. <br/>Probst: Alex is swing all over the place but not connecting. <br/>Let it stop swinging. The skull is on the ground, Alex. <br/>It's on the ground? <br/>Yes. <br/>Where is it? <br/>Move to your left, to your left. Forward, forward, forward. Right there. Okay, you got it. You got it. <br/>Come on, girl, a little faster, a little faster. <br/>Probst: Stacy's back for Moto. Cassandra on the course. <br/>All right, there you go! <br/>Probst: Alex has it, and he's heading back. <br/>Don't hit the... don't hit... don't hit...  Probst: Alex is back. <br/>Switch. <br/>Probst: Ravu going to switch out callers. Lisi is done. Alex is taking over. <br/>Go straight, straight, go! Go, Ed, go. Keep going, Ed. <br/>Come on, girl! Yeah! All right, hands on the floor, hands on the floor! Right in front of you. Forward, forward, forward, forward. <br/>Ooh, I got it! <br/>There you go, that's it. Straight in front of you. <br/>Okay, okay! <br/>Almost. You got it! Go down on your knees. It's on the floor, right next to your stick. You got it, you got it! Ed, get up. <br/>Okay, where? <br/>Forward, forward, forward! You got it! Run back, Ed, run back! <br/>Ten paces, come back, come back! <br/>Probst: Cassandra back. Earl out on the course. Edgardo now back for Ravu. <br/>Forward, Dreamz, forward. <br/>Probst: We are tied 2-2. <br/>To your right, slide right, slide right. There you go. That's where it is, baby! Yeah! <br/>Dreamz, stop, stop! Move to your left! One step. Right above you. You got it! Get on your knees. Right next to the stick. Follow the stick with your left hand. You got it! You got it! <br/>Probst: Earl is back. Boo looking for that club. Boo now out on the course. <br/>Come on, come on, come on! Yeah, Boo, keep going! <br/>You got it Dreamz. Come back, forward! Dreamz, run, run, run, run, run! Straight! You got it, Dreamz! <br/>Probst: Dreamz is back. Rocky now out on the course for Ravu. <br/>Rock, go, forward, forward, forward! You've got a long way to go, buddy. <br/>Come on, left, left, left, left! Your left! Other side, other side. <br/>This way? <br/>Yes, that way. That's your left! Right there! Right there! Give it a swing! Give it a swing! Come on, Boo, you don't have to hit it that hard. Just hit it a little. There you go! Hands on the floor, hands on the floor! There, that's where it is. <br/>Forward half a step. Smash! There you go! It's on the floor. Right behind your left foot. Right next your left foot. You got it! Turn around, forward, Rock, forward, forward! There you go. Run back! <br/>Probst: Boo is back. Moto has one bundle left. <br/>Faster, Yau-Man, faster, faster! Follow that rail. Follow that rail. You're doing awesome. Follow that rail! <br/>Forward, Mookie, right hand, go! <br/>Probst: Mookie working for that last skull for Ravu. <br/>Okay, go forward, go forward, Yau-Man! Yau-Man, go forward! Yau-Man, go forward! Yau, stop! Yau-Man, stop! <br/>Hey, you want to switch, Michelle? I got a loud voice. <br/>Probst: Moto switching out, Boo going to become the caller. Both teams have one bundle left. <br/>Tell me where it is. <br/>I'm blind right now. Hold on. <br/>Run, run, run, stop! To your right! To the right! Again, again! <br/>Yau, to your left. Now hit down. Get them down! Down on your knees! Right in front of you! By your knees! <br/>Probst: Yau-Man has the last bundle. <br/>Turn 180, 180. <br/>Probst: He's got to get it on the puzzle table. <br/>Left, left, left, on the fence! Left, on the fence! <br/>Probst: He does. He's got to get back now. <br/>Come back, Yau! <br/>One half step forward, Mookie. Right there, smash it! <br/>It's right below you! Get on your hands and knees, Mookie! Stop! It's right in front of you, right next to the stick. Turn around, stop! <br/>Come back, Yau! Keep on, keep on! <br/>Probst: Yau Man back. Take off your blindfolds! Go! Moto has all bundles! They're now working on the puzzle! <br/>Mookie, run! Forward, forward! <br/>Probst: Mookie takes a hard hit into the side of the course. <br/>To your left, to your left, to your left! Forward, forward, forward! <br/>Probst: Take off your blindfolds! Ravu has all five bundles! They're now working on the puzzle. It is a two-word phrase. <br/>"Castaway," "castaway," "castaway."  There's no w. It's not "castaway."  Where is Michelle? <br/>Yes? "Cannibal," "cannibal," "cannibal."  "cannibal."  "Cannibalism," "cannibalism."  "Cannibalism," "cannibalism."  We're ready. <br/>Probst: Moto thinks they have it. <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>Probst: "Cannibal Isles" is correct! Motto wins immunity! Motto wins immunity! [ cheering] [ cheering]  Probst: Moto, congratulations. <br/>Yeah. [ applause]  Probst: You still have not lost an immunity challenge, nobody in danger of  going home tonight. Ravu, unfortunately not the same case. One of the six of you will be voted out at tonight's tribal council. You have the afternoon to figure out who that's going to be. Grab your stuff. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. <br/>We lost today. We're going to have to vote somebody out. Alex and I figured out that we don't need really strong players. You know, once we get closer to the merger, if there's a merger, what we need  is people that are loyal, and Lisi is one of those people. I know Rocky's counting on getting Lisi out, but, I mean, I think his head is  next. <br/>Rocky, I don't trust him that much. <br/>I don't trust Rocky. <br/>I don't know if we should tell Mookie or not, because he's tight with Rocky. <br/>Don't talk to him. <br/>But Rocky's out. I can't... I mean, I like the guy, but I can't... he's... last night he was  just...  Too much. <br/>Rocky has just this bad vibe about him, and I think one of the reasons that  Ravu didn't ever win was his attitude about stuff. Lisi, Alex, and I were from the other tribe, and she knows that she has to be  loyal to us because she doesn't have anybody else to tag along with. It's you, me, and Edgardo. <br/>I know this. <br/>So even if we get whittled down, the three of us are straight. <br/>For real, for real. <br/>So Rocky goes next, okay? <br/>Okay. <br/>And Ed and I were talking. He had kind of a good idea. I want to know your thoughts on it. Okay, we need to figure out who has got the damn immunity idol. <br/>Let me tell you something right now. The idol's on this island. It's here. <br/>Right. <br/>It's not on Exile. I think that with the clues that I have, you, me, and Edgardo should start  prowling around the island. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think we're better off if we try to spread this than just me trying to be  greedy trying to find the idol, so...  Right, I agree. <br/>Take me to the water so I can rinse off my freaking socks. <br/>All right, let's go. <br/>The story with the idol is there's some clues that I could go on which lead  me to believe that it might be here, but it's all really vague. What I'm going to do with the idol is have Edgardo and Alex help me. <br/>What do these clue say? <br/>It might be right underneath this big cave, underneath where people sleep. <br/>Okay. <br/>So it might be... it might be underneath the palm fronds. We'll see what happens. You know, I have no choice but to believe Alex at this point. But that being said, this game turns and twists, and people say turns and  twists, and people say one thing and do another. one thing and do another. <br/>For real? That's what they're telling you? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Here's the thing. <br/>Here's the thing. Would you guys care if you guys all voted him and then I just voted, like,  just someone? Because I...  Yeah, no, I wouldn't care. I'd probably vote with you. <br/>Dreamz told me that Alex and Edgardo were talking about sending off Rocky  before Lisi. Well, that leaves only one of previous Ravu, and they're just going to wipe  us out. I got have to figure out a way to turn it around, and I think right now my  man Dreamz, I trust him. I think he was left out in the other previous tribe, and so the opportunity  to, you know, align myself with himself is the best thing I can do. <br/>Me and Rocky's personality, we don't bump heads like it appeared that it  would, because I understand Rocky. That's how... that's who he is. That's how he talks, you know what I mean? That don't mean that he's mad at you and want to fight you, you get what I'm  saying? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think Rocky knows that he's on the chopping block tonight. Some of the boys think, "Hey, he's got a bad attitude; he's got to  go."  What's everybody crying about? <br/>Losing today. <br/>Just got to win tomorrow. <br/>Rocky throws a lot of false attitude, but it's not real attitude. It's not the real way he feels. It's just his personality. <br/>Right? <br/>We have to win tomorrow. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I never really got the chance to know Rocky. I would really like to get to know Rocky. So I feel I would rather Lisi leave if somebody was to leave, because then  we'll still be strong, but just without Lisi. <br/>I hate tribal council. What do you think, bitch? <br/>I think you should [ no audio] push over a little bit, unless you want to  make out with me [ no audio]. To be honest with you, I've been a little nervous today. Out of all the tribal councils, I was the one pulling the strings in all the  other ones. strings in all the other ones. That's not the case this time. That's not the case this time. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think Lisi's definitely going to go home, but who knows? going to go home, but who knows? I could go home today. I could go home today. <br/>Going into tribal is going to be like a cliffhanger situation, because even  though we've all talked that I'm not going to get voted out, you never know  what voted out, you never know what happens at the last minute. happens at the last minute. <br/>Probst: So let's start with Lisi. When you weren't selected to be on either tribe, you had somewhat of a  meltdown. <br/>Yeah, sure. I was looking forward to going home. I thought that was my exit. <br/>Probst: So when you came back to this tribe, you had to be a little uneasy  about how you would be welcomed. <br/>Um, I knew I was going to go back to a tribe that contained people from my  old tribe, so I was really not concerned about general consensus of the tribe  towards me, because I knew I was going to find a friend wherever I went. And from that thread, I would just, you know, start bringing myself up. <br/>Probst: Dreamz, you watched Lisi out there. What was your reaction? <br/>Well, at first, when Lisi had the breakdown, I knew that she just wanted to quit  the game. And I was like, "Man, we got to win so we don't have to get Lisi,"  because I didn't want her on our team if she was wanting to go home. But when she came back and she wasn't the same way she was when I seen her  with the breakdown, I was happy about that, and I knew that we were ready for  business. <br/>Probst: Rocky, what's the feeling as tribal council starts to approach? Is everybody scurrying around, trying to make sure it's not them? <br/>I think it's in the back of people's minds, because you know, we just...  we're a tight group, but we're a new group, you know what I mean? So I think everyone's a little... not really nervous, but it's always in the  back of everybody's minds exactly what's going on. <br/>Probst: So, Mookie, this tribe's strength being its physical strength and  agility, how does that factor in to who you get rid of? <br/>It's hard choosing which person is going to go, because we're all so strong. And Lisi over here brings another aspect. Maybe we need a girl. So it makes it really difficult trying to figure out who to let go, because  this whole physical thing hasn't really been working in our favor so far. So you have to look at it both ways, and I really don't know. <br/>Probst: Rocky, can you trust these guys to be telling you the truth as we get  ready to vote? <br/>Basically, you know what? I'm going with my gut right now. I trust certain people. That's all I can do. And then I just got to read everybody else, you know, see what I can do. <br/>Probst: Lisi, does this tribe need to make any adjustments? You get up tomorrow morning; what's the first thing you're going to do? <br/>Look around and be like, "Ooh, God, I'm still here?" [ laughing]  Yeah, pretty much. We need to win. Whatever happens, we need to win. <br/>Probst: Okay, let's get to the vote. If, at this point, somebody has found the hidden immunity idol, and you need  to play it tonight, you would present it to me before I read the votes. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Rocky, you're up. Rocky, you're up. <br/>Because that's the way it's  Because that's the way it's got to go. got to go. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and they want to play it, now is the  time to do play it, now is the time to do so. so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. First vote, Lisi. Lisi. Rocky. Two votes Lisi, one vote Rocky. Rocky. Two votes Lisi, two votes Rocky. Rocky. That's three votes Rocky, two votes Lisi. One vote left. Seventh person voted out and the first member of our jury, Rocky. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Get it, boys, huh? <br/>Get it, boys, huh? <br/>Probst: Rocky, the tribe has spoken. spoken. <br/>Be good, boys, huh? <br/>Be good, boys, huh? <br/>Probst: Well, based on what I heard tonight, Rocky had no idea that was  coming. If it could happen to him, it can happen to you. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor...  I'm going to cry. <br/>Probst: ...things get tough for Lisi. <br/>This sucks. <br/>Probst: The tribes learn a new skill. <br/>Boo is doing the whole white guy thing. <br/>Probst: And at Ravu...  We should just tear this place all apart. <br/>Probst: ...the hunt for the idol gets dirty. <br/>We're digging for the idol while Lisi and Dreamz are while Lisi and Dreamz  are sleeping. sleeping. <br/>Ah! I'm extremely pissed off. I'm angry. They got me good, man. They got me really good. I didn't see anything coming. Then all of a sudden, boom, I get smacked in the mouth way cinder block. But you know what? Now I get to be on the jury, and hopefully none of those cats get the million  bucks thanks to me.
