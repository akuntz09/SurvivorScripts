<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," at the Yawa  tribe, Cole broke a Healers' trust. <br/>Jessica's got an advantage for the next tribal. <br/>Jeff: And got caught. <br/>It's my prerogative on who I tell. Kid -- did I chew to form a relationship with someone I shouldn't  have? <br/>Jeff: At the Soko tribe, Ryan had an old alliance with a Hustler  and built a new bond with a Healer. <br/>So you andry going to have to be friends. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: At the Levu tribe, Desi held all the power. At tribal council, the game turned upside down. <br/>This is being used against you to block your vote. <br/>Jeff: And Joe seized the opportunity. <br/>I got something for you, Jeff. Making a big move. This is a hidden immunity idol. And sending a Hero home. Alan, the tribe has spoken. <br/>I read your face. Thank you, baby girl. <br/>Jeff: 14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>That was wild. <br/>All I have to say is well played. At tribal council when Joe decided to play the idol for himself,  my entire jaw dropped. Everything in my whole world just stopped. I wouldn't say they was like 100% team Alan, but he was the one Hero  on my tribe. What did you say to me at the end? <br/>I read your face. That's all it was. <br/>I caught myself. <br/>It's too late at that. <br/>Jeff: Joe made himself target on purpose. He tricked us all. Joe is a scary one. He's getting crazier and crazier, but right now it's 2-2. So who knows what is going to happen. <br/>I knew you were crazy,  but I didn't know you were crazy and smart  I’m crazy and smart. I have completely blindsided the entire tribe with the idol. I had to play the nervous route. I didn't want anyone thinking I was overconfident. I put my head down. That was all an act. I had the idol. I'm not going home. Every single tribal is so scary. Every single tribal is so scary. <br/>Dammit. <br/>Oh, my lord. <br/>Oh, man. My become hurts. <br/>Are you okay? <br/>You all right, ben? <br/>Good. <br/>What was it that popped like that? <br/>Just the bamboo. [popping] oh, you got to be kidding. <br/>Sorry, ben. <br/>What was that? <br/>I don't know. <br/>You all right, man? <br/>I’m good. <br/>I think just the leaves. I think it has a little heat. <br/>If you're a marine, you hear a bang like, that you think  my friends are dying. I feel bad for him. <br/>Yeah, that is bad. <br/>There was a bamboo explosion in the fire, and I don't like  loud noises like that. Like when they're unexpected, it kind of put me in a bad spot. I was in the marines for three and a half years. When you go through combat and you come back, there is no way to  adjust fully. There's things that are there forever. Coming back with that stuff, it's hard, and you feel lonely, and  you feel that nobody understands. <br/>You sure you're all right? <br/>All right. Other people, civilians or whatever have no idea what it's like  to be shot at or have people try to kill you. You can't comprehend that without being there and going through  it. And so those reactions are 100% real for men and women that have  fought for our country. And it's hard to be around other people that don't understand  that. Before I met my wife, that was a monkey on my back. My wife and kids have definitely saved me from my demons, my  nightmares, and the past. I used to live in the past. That's in the a good thing for anyone. You have the look forward to the future, because the past will  eat you Alive, but the future will save you. You know, winning the $1 million for my family is my goal, but  there's a bigger picture, and it's bigger than me, my family, the game of  "Survivor." it's about just being able to show vets who have gone  through battle and war and depression and p.T.S.D., there's a way to life outside  of all that hell. That's what I’m doing. Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. [ theme song playing]  Jeff: Come on in, guys. Yawa, Soko, getting your first look at the new Levu tribe. Alan voted out at the last tribal council. All right. You guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, your feet will be tied  together. Your arm will be bound to your side. On my go you will slither through the sand while pushing a ball relay  style through the course. When you reach the finish, the remaining tribe member will shoot  five balls into a very high basket. First two tribes to finish win reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: It's at hot day in fiji. It would be nice to cool down with some iced coffee. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh. <br/>Jeff: Iced coffee, huge array of pastries, plus coffee and  tea to take back to camp. Fill you up and pick you up. <br/>It's gun to run right through us. I don't even care. <br/>Jeff: Second tribe to finish, one jug of iced coffee. Losers, nothing. Soko, you have one extra person. Sitting somebody out. Cannot sit out the same person in back-to-back challenges. Whoever sits out here must compete in the immunity challenge. Who you going to sit out? Chris, you're going to sit this one out. Yawa, who you going to sit out? <br/>Me, I guess. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, Lauren, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else take a minute to strategize, and we'll get  started. All right. Here we go. For reward, Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Jeff: Jessica, Roark, and Desi out of the gate. Desi is ripping it up. Desi with an early lead. Got to get there with her head, too. You're good. Go, Ashley. Blue out the a fast lead thanks to Desi. <br/>Come on, Roark. <br/>Get in there, baby. <br/>Jeff: Roark struggling. <br/>Come on, Roark. You got it. <br/>Push it. <br/>Jeff: And it is Jessica now getting very close to dr. Mike. <br/>Good job, good job. <br/>Get your head over here. <br/>Jeff: Get your head. There you're good. Go, dr. Mike. <br/>Come on, Mike. <br/>Nice job, ash. <br/>Jeff: Ashley has that ball over the hill. Now she's got to get herself over it. <br/>Great, ash. <br/>Jeff: Ashley slithering down. <br/>Come on, Roark. <br/>Jeff: You're there. Go, Alan. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>You got it, girl. You're doing great. <br/>Jeff: Ashley, you're good. Go, Joe. Levu is ripping this course up. <br/>Go, Joe. You got it. <br/>Jeff: Levu with a huge lead right now. <br/>Use your knees, Mike. <br/>Jeff: Dr. Mike struggling to get any kind of a rhythm. Alan is moving quickly now. Soko back in this. <br/>Use that body. Roll it. <br/>Jeff: Joe is already up the course. You're good. Go, blue, go! Wow. Levu with a huge lead right now. <br/>I got you, ash. <br/>Come on, Mike. <br/>Jeff: Mike face first. <br/>Come on, Mike, you got it. <br/>Jeff: You're good, Ali. Go, Ryan. <br/>Nice, Ryan! Go, Ryan. You got it  . <br/>Jeff: Devon already shooting for leefer leaf. The other two teams will have to move very fast to have a shot  at this reward. Mike is now in last place but continues to work. You are only as fast as your slowest. Ryan digging in now. Ryan loses the ball for Soko. A giant setback. <br/>Let's go. Pick it up. <br/>You're there, Mike. <br/>Jeff: Opens the door for Soko. Devon with another shot. <br/>You got it, dev. <br/>Jeff: First one drops for Levu. <br/>Good job, good job. <br/>Jeff: It is now Ben who is tearing it up. That is how you do it right here. You're good. Yawa. Go. <br/>K078 on, Cole. Good job. <br/>Drew: The door is still open for Yawa to win this. Deferred action for childhood arrivals -- Devon misses again. It is now Ryan trying after losing his ball. <br/>Ryan, you can do this. Control, Ryan, control. <br/>Jeff: Ryan loses the ball again. <br/>Ryan, don't give up. <br/>Jeff: Come on, Cole. Cole is shooting for Soko. Devon shooting for Levu. This challenge is wide open right now. Def within the second for Levu. Ryan's tribe is still in it. Trying for a third time. <br/>Come on, Ryan. You're strong. You can do this. And Ryan loses the ball again. <br/>There you go. <br/>You're doing great, dev. <br/>Jeff: Devon with the third for Levu. <br/>Come on, Cole. <br/>Jeff: Cole with first for Yawa. Devon with the fourth for Levu. Devon could win it right here, and he does! Devon wins reward, iced coffee and pastries. Looking for second place. <br/>We can still come back, Ryan. <br/>There you go, come on, Ryan. <br/>Jeff: Ryan the closest he's been to getting it over the  hill. Cole misses again. Ryan working his way up, using that face. <br/>Let's go, man. There you go, there you go. -Ryan, you got this. <br/>We are definitely still in this, Ryan. <br/>Jeff: You're good, Soko, go. Everybody got to get on the matt. Cole with the third. <br/>Cole, I need my coffee! <br/>Jeff: Cole scores the fourth. JP Has to get everybody to that mat before he can shoot. Won't matter, Yawa wins reward, sending Soko back the camp with  absolutely nothing. <br/>I’m sorry, guys. <br/>Jeff: Levu, new tribe, new result, nice win. Dominating. Big reward. Iced coffee, pastries, and coffee and tea to take back the camp. Come get it. Enjoy the afternoon. <br/>Good job, guys. [applause]  Jeff: Yawa, not as big a reward, but on "Survivor"  any win is a win. Come grab your jug of iced coffee. Enjoy it. Head back to camp. Soko, got nothing for you. Gab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>Brian didn't this well in the reward challenge, but  challenges are only part of the game. I've been are Ryan the whole time, so my trust is there. I need to do everything I can to have his back. I need to do everything I can to have his back. <br/>We got goodies. <br/>This is the happiest I've ever been. We won the sweetest reward so far, literally and figuratively. Not only did we have this huge tray full of pastries, but a  coffee brewing, tea brewing kind of setup. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Mmm. <br/>We got this. Cheers, cheers. <br/>To the first and best win ever. <br/>First of many. <br/>After tribal council last night, we were clearly divide,  but with this reward, it's time for us to come together as a team. So I think we can do it. <br/>What an amazing day to have after last night. <br/>Winning that reward, it was just so nice. Spiritually, physically, mentally, all of it. But it makes me realize more and more how important it is to  keep my mind in the game. Thank you guys for letting me step up. Thank you for trusting me. <br/>No egos, bro. <br/>I think the best thing  for my game in the end would be to get rid of Joe. He's the strongest player I've met here as far as knowledge of  the game, strategy. He's a good player. He scares me. <br/>I’m going to go bathe. <br/>Ash, you good? <br/>On water, yeah. <br/>So ash, the situation now. <br/>I know. <br/>Just know I’m with you. I want us go to stay together. <br/>Two versus two. <br/>I’m sticking with you  because I trust you. <br/>After a night like last night, I’m feeling incredibly  nervous. The only good thing is that I have Devon. We are in this together. <br/>I’m not voting with them,  that's for sure. <br/>All right. Cool. I don't trust either of them. <br/>I'd rather have it be a tie than go with them two. <br/>Yeah. Same. Right now Joe thinks he's finally in control, but me and Devon  are still in this. It's still 50/50. There's just no middle man. <br/>How do we get Desi. <br/>I don't know, but Joe is  coming. <br/>Devon and I are really going to work on Desi. With a tie vote to keep herself safe, I think she'd flip on  show. If not, the next vote is going to rocks. <br/>I’m so fricking sorry,  guys. <br/>It's a-ok, dude. It's just a reward. <br/>Thanks for cheering me on, guys, I kept hearing you. <br/>I did nothing in, in this  challenge, so you did way more for me. <br/>An argument can be made I did nothing. <br/>That's so funny. <br/>The reward challenge was an absolute disaster. I lost the challenge for my tribe. <br/>Let's open a coconut. <br/>Want a small one? <br/>Want me to try and do it? <br/>But at the same time, I just have to continue to cater to  my specific skill set, which is my social game, and my social game is  everything. It is built upon making people laugh. I'm a coconut opener watcher. If I can help people get through the day and laugh, then it's  easier for them to crack open that coconut for me. <br/>Oh, that was good. <br/>And pick me up after I lose a challenge. Everybody has failure in the game. Everybody. You just don't want that failure to be getting voted out. <br/>I haven't grabbed water. Want a couple of us to do a refill. <br/>I can go. <br/>I’m objectively on the  outside, as I am the lone Healer at Soko beach. I love a 2-2-1 split, and I want to start developing friendships  with these people where they feel safe with me to talk game with me. How are you feeling, the fact that you had sick people and new  it's you? <br/>Obviously I have faith that I can return with them for  sure. <br/>I feel like I've always  gotten very good vibes from all of you girls. <br/>It's definitely good to receive some support from Ali,  some interest in working together, and when we merge, if she is looking for  numbers, I can bring some numbers. <br/>It would be girls and then what, Cole? <br/>Cole and I believe I have Mike. <br/>Really? I think I have Ryan, but the thing is it's hard because I feel  like whatever happens next, like we need strong. <br/>I know. <br/>But Ryan definitely plays the best social game out there. <br/>He's a total sweetheart. <br/>I want to keep him  because you have to be... The Hustlers were just a group of losers, but being  here I can build these personal relationships that I know will further my  game. So if I can build this rapport with Roark, hopefully when the  merge does come, she will take me in as part of their six, seven, because at  the beginning you need a lot of numbers. <br/>Let's be cautious with Chrissy and JP <br/>I agree. It's very difficult to know to make the right decision, but I think  going with Roark is best for our game. The next two tribals if we have to go, we can vote out Chrissy  and JP If this works out, we can go far in this game. <br/>I had a good talk with Roark. <br/>Roark? <br/>Yeah. She's like, I really want to work with you. I was like, if we lose Chrissy,er think we'll be fine. <br/>I like it. So tell Roark that we're on board with her. The good news is I continue to be in positions where people want  to work with me. <br/>I’m going to still Chrissy  that we're on board with her. <br/>For sure. <br/>But unfortunately my two closest alliance members, Chrissy  and Ali, will never work with each other. So I’m in the middle. And I need to tread very lightly not to mess this up. And I need to tread very lightly not to mess this up. <br/>Cole's eating habits are very bad. He's very inconsiderate. He's like a pig. He licks everything. He is licking the spoon. Then he scratches between high legs. It's very gross. <br/>Anybody else want the rest of my rice? <br/>I'll eat it. <br/>Ben notices it. He's rolling his eyes. He's getting ticked. I hope Cole keeps digging his hole deeper and deeper and deeper,  and maybe his lips will stick together. <br/>I’m going to get water. Anyone else need water. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Adam? <br/>When we first got here after the split, I felt like Cole, Mike,  and I were in control, but after seeing Cole tell secrets, I do believe that Mike  is paranoid about Cole as a number. <br/>We have to win today. <br/>Yeah, we do. <br/>On the flip side of that, Mike can keep a secret, so right  now it would be to the benefit of my game to form more of a bond with Mike. Do you want the dig while I fill? <br/>Okay. On our last island, Joe and Cole found an item near the well, so  this morning I go to the well with jess cash she says, Mike, why don't you  dig some more. So I start digging again. <br/>I’m going to start right  here. <br/>Cole would tell us if he found it, wouldn't he? <br/>I’m just digging and  digging and hoping I find something. If there is an idol, I’m going the find that idol. If there is an idol, I’m going the find that idol. <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. <br/>I have been looking for  this idol non-stop. There's always a danger in somebody else knowing about the idol. <br/>Congratulation, you have found the hidden immunity idol. <br/>I’m okay with Jessica  knowing I have the idol. So at this point I’m trusting her. <br/>Cha-ching, baby. <br/>This is for us. In reality, this idol is mine. "Survivor" is only one-third over. But things have changed in going from the bottom to the top. This has been the story of my life, but you can never  underestimate dr. Mike. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Sure. <br/>Jeff: First things first, take back the idols. Thank you, Chrissy. Thank you, Jessica. Once again immunity is become up for grabs. For today's challenge, we're going to swim out the a boat and  retrieve three bags of rice. You must then push the rice through a hole, get it across the bAlance  beam to sure, where you will tear open the bag searching for three balls. Finally you'll maneuver those balls through a maze of holes to  the top. First two tribes to finish win immunity, safe from the vote. Losers tribal council where somebody will be the fifth person  voted out of this game. Soko, you have one extra person. Who you going to sit out? Chrissy sat out the reward challenge. She must participate. Who is it going to be? <br/>Me. <br/>Ryan going to sit out. Yawa, one extra person. Lauren sat out at the reward challenge, must participate. <br/>Mike. <br/>Mike going to sit out for Yawa. Sitouts take a seat on the bench. Everybody else take a minute to strategize, and we'll get  started. All right. Here we go. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! Your first step is get somebody on your boat and get those bags  of rice off. Yawa doing a nice job. Roark doing a nice job for Soko. Ashley is doing a nice job. Everybody has their bags of rice. Now comes the fun part. You've got to squeeze a rectangular bag of rice through a very  small round hole. Ashley going over. Desi is over. Ali going over. Chrissy going over. Lauren is over. And very quickly Yawa has their first bag through. Soko has their first bag through. Levu still working on that first bag. Yawa has their second bag through. Soko has their second bag. Levu has their first bag. Trying the stay in it. Soko with that third bag. You're good. Head on. Yawa has their third bag. You're good. Head on. It is now Levu, who dominated in the reward challenge, now  struggling in the immunity challenge. They cannot get that second bag through. Next phase is the bAlance beam. You got to get those heavy bags of rice across that beam. Levu finally has their second bag. JP Heading across that beam. <br/>Slow and steady. <br/>Jeff: He's through the first third. Lauren gives it a go. She drops. Devon has their third bag. Start moving, guys. JP Is across. <br/>That aboy, JP <br/>Jeff: Devon making it look easy. Levu is right back in this. Cole now heading across for Yawa. Ali trying to carry a bag of rice on her head. Desi doing the same thing. Once again Desi is making a challenge look easy. JP Now trying again with another bag for Soko. You can go as often of the as yo want. Levu got off to a terrible start, but they have now taken the  lead. JP Across with the second bag. Ben very close with the second bag. And he's got it. Devon has the third bag. Go, Levu. Cole has the third bag for Yawa. It is now Joe working on recovering those balls. They've got a big lead. Lauren is across. Go, Yawa! <br/>Go, guys. You got this. <br/>Jeff: It is now Soko in dead last. The lead is opening now for Levu and for Yawa. It is now Ben ripping through that bag trying to find those  balls. JP With that third bag for Soko. Joe has that third and final ball. JP Has carried all three bags if he can make it. And he does. Ben has the second ball. Ashley is first on the maze. Here comes Soko with that first bag. Ben has the third ball. They can start on the maze. JP Trying to make up some lost time. Soko had a rough go of it on the bAlance beam. <br/>Slow it down. <br/>Jeff: Ashley's had a lot of time to learn this challenge. <br/>There you go. <br/>Jeff: Head starts matter in this game because there is a learning  curve. JP Trying to get that third ball free and he's got it. They can start working now on this maze. It's going to be Chrissy going first. <br/>Come on, Chrissy. <br/>Jeff: Ben is doing a nice job. Ben gets very close to the top, and Ben has the first one for Yawa. It's going to be Jessica now in. <br/>Do I have enough bAlance beam behind me? <br/>Jeff: Chrissy drops. Got to drop it and start again. Ashley is one big move away from dropping that first ball for Levu. And they tie it up. Levu has one. <br/>I got to take my sneakers  off. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy drops again. It's now Ali in for Soko. Devon on the maze for Levu. As Jessica inches closer and closer with that second ball for Yawa. <br/>All right. You're good. Take a breath. Up, up, jess. <br/>Jeff: There it is! That's two for Yawa. They take the lead. It's going to be Cole. <br/>You're through, you're through. <br/>Jeff: Ali very close now to landing that first ball for Soko. Devon close with the second for Levu. Ali has it. That's one for Soko. Chrissy going to come back in. Devon very close with that second. Devon is there with the second. Tied again. <br/>Cole, you got it, buddy. <br/>Jeff: Cole two-thirds of the way up for Yawa for the win. Very close to the top. Chrissy is halfway through for Soko, who is trying to get back  in this. And Desi now on the course for Levu. Cole has passed the last spot of danger. He can just get that ball to drop, it is immunity for Yawa, in  tribal council. Cole closer, closer. For the win, Yawa has it. Yawa wins immunity. We're looking for one more. This is it. Chrissy feels the pressure now. Got to drop that second ball to stay in it. Chrissy falls again. Cannot figure out the beam. <br/>Does one of you guys want the try? <br/>Do you want me the try? <br/>It's up to you. I can try. <br/>Do you want Ali to try? <br/>Chrissy not going to give up her spot. Desi threading the needle nicely. Chrissy is trying to catch up. <br/>I can't stay on the bAlance  beam. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy drops again. Another huge setback. Dead very close for the win with Levu. She can do it right here. It's over. Desi wins immunity, sending Soko to tribal council. <br/>Nice job, guys. <br/>Sorry, guys. <br/>Jeff: Yawa, congratulations. In tribal council tonight. <br/>Thank you, sir. <br/>Jeff: Levu, nice job. No tribal council. All right. Yawa, Levu, grab your stuff, head back to camp, enjoy the night  off. All right, Soko, grab jury stuff head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal where somebody will be the fifth  person voted out of "Survivor: Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers."  Tonight is my first tribal council. I am nervous, but Chrissy definitely struggled in this  challenge. She needs to go. <br/>I do not feel safe going  into tonight's tribal. And I am having a hard time trusting anyone, but I think that I’m  going to have to go there in order to move forward in this game. <br/>You guys good? <br/>I don't know if I want  the get wet again. <br/>I agree. <br/>I’m probably pretty good. <br/>You always are nervous in this game, and I feel like if I’m  going to play, I want the play big. <br/>Do you want to go down? <br/>Okay. <br/>See that big log that washed up, I wanted to grab that  before the tide came back. <br/>Can we just sit for a second? I want the have a thoughtful conversation. <br/>Of course. <br/>I believe that Roark is  in t next most dangerous player behind me. I haven't been able to put my finger on it. <br/>You to me are the most strategic player in this game, and  I really thought you and I together could sit down here and talk out options. If we send a by home...  I completely agree. <br/>We're headed to tribal and today is the first day Chrissy  ever feels the need to talk game with me. In my head, I’m like, are you kidding me? I want Chrissy to go home. <br/>That allow, you, Ali and me to keep open an all-girl  option. <br/>I personally don't have  an objection. <br/>Is that potentially a workable plan? <br/>Of course. <br/>I was really hoping that Roark  wanted to work with me going forward, but I don't believe anything she says  and I wish I could stop and say to her, you are not the smartest person here,  but I don't want the ruin my game, so my plan is to create this imaginary  girl's alliance. If there is a girl's alliance, then clearly I would not be the  one voted out, and JP Might think he were the next to go. <br/>What are you thinking? <br/>The four of us get together and vote out Roark. <br/>I think she's good in  challenges, though, too. <br/>Roark wants to do an all-girls alliance. <br/>Oh, really? <br/>Oh, she's got to go. Simple as that. <br/>JP And I are two, so now I need Ryan. I want to believe that Ryan has my back. <br/>I think Roark is trying  to get Ali and me. <br/>So they would vote for me, because they need the keep JP <br/>Right. <br/>So we would need to make you, me, and JP <br/>Right. <br/>I brought it up with JP,  he really likes Roark, and then I said to him, I heard she might be doing an  all-girl alliance, and then he's like, I’m down with that. So you, me, and JP At least? <br/>Perfect. <br/>The plan right now is that JP, Ryan, and myself will  blindside Roark and send her home. <br/>Chrissy should have just backed out after she tried so  many times. <br/>Yeah. Yeah. <br/>Chrissy's probably going to say you. <br/>Let's keep whittling the Heroes down. <br/>The main reason for taking out Chrissy tonight is she  could not bAlance on that beam. And with her, we're not going to be as strong in challenges. And so I want Chrissy to go home tonight. <br/>What did Roark say? <br/>Roark said we get rid of Chrissy. <br/>Chrissy? All right. <br/>You know I trust you and I trust Roark. I trust you the most. <br/>I’m in the swing vote  position. I seemingly have the choice tonight on who to send home. Me and Chrissy are so tight because that first day I went to her  with the advantage. On the other hand, Ali has only played the game with one person,  and that person is me. And whoever I go with, there's going to be one person who is  going to hate me. This is a huge decision, but I’m here to try and win this game  to build the best social game I can, and unfortunately I’m breaking that  social bond with somebody tonight, but I still think it best advances my  game. <br/>Jeff: Roark, grab the unlit torch, dip it in, and get  fire. This is part of the ritual at tribal council, because in this  game, fire represents your life. When your fire is gone, so are you. So Ali, one of the things about "Survivor" is everybody  brings a different approach to the game. Have you noticed any difference in how the Hustlers or the Heroes  or the Healers are playing the game? <br/>Yeah. I mean, I think today's loss kind of showed a little bit, where  if I was unable to complete the task at hand, I would say, we have three  other people the make it happen and move out of the way. <br/>Wait. I did that. Are you talking about me? <br/>I felt that you started  it...  I turned around so many  times and said, does anybody want the take over, and you guys were like, no,  keep going, keep going. <br/>I but I would have said,  you guys tree, we need someone to get us on the board. <br/>I remember turning  several times and saying, who wants to take this? And they all stood there and said, you go again. <br/>Jeff: Wow. <br/>It's her side, my side, and the truth, right? <br/>Jeff: And there is a voting booth 20 yards from here about  to get used. Ryan, these are the things that ultimately can decide a vote. <br/>A lot of the times the truth is what you made of it. I didn't see anybody give up or anybody controlling. I saw us trying to complete the task in the best way to catch us  up an complete the challenge. <br/>What happened when you got back from camp? <br/>I hadn't talked any  strategy at all with Roark and I didn't want to come the tribal council and  never have had a conversation with her about what we were going to do next. <br/>And I hope we can speak more consistently about it,  because on the day when you needed me is the day when you called, instead of  sounding board with me as we were going. So that would just be a preference moving forward. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, that's two strikes, chris similar from Ali on  the challenge, criticism from Roark, yeah, you're my friend now. <br/>She didn't talk to me either. This is a two-way street here a little bit. I specifically talked to Ali, Ryan came to me. I was talking to JP We were all talking to each other, so I don't know why this has  to be a Chrissy has to approach Roark situation where she could have come to  me, as well. <br/>She just said she specifically talked to Ali. She never specifically talked to me. <br/>I have no comment. <br/>Jeff: Ryan, what did you see? <br/>Chrissy took Roark down to the beach. I had no idea what they were talking about. You start running everything through your head because it only  takes three tonight. <br/>JP What was your take? <br/>All of a sudden two girls walk away, you start running  those scenarios through your head. There's two guys and three girl, so that could be another way to  go with it, and that makes me uneasy sitting here. <br/>Jeff: So Chrissy, if it's true that maybe these original  lines are blurred, are you more, less, or the same in terms of uncomfortable  about the vote tonight? <br/>I don't know. I mean, I think I came here tonight expecting that it could be  me tonight. So hearing all of this from all of them, it's surprising and  it's not surprising. I don't know. I mean, I’m not going to beat myself up over it. I'm doing the best I can. <br/>Jeff: Roark, how about for you? Are you now more comfortable or less comfortable since she sat  down? <br/>Can I feel the same comfortable? <br/>Jeff: Yeah. <br/>I feel the same  comfortable. I've made bonds I believe in that I can vote based upon. <br/>Jeff: So Ali, that sounds like somebody who believes they  have bonded with at least two people. <br/>I think that you can't  really ever earn trust until you get here. Roark had a great tribe with the Healers, but did they really  know and understand the trust that say me and Ryan know because we voted  together or Chrissy and JP Know because they vote together? Once we get here, that's when you find out who you can trust. <br/>Jeff: So Roark, two Hustler, two Healers, you in the  middle. Are you the swing, or are you the easy vote? <br/>I think tonight I’m the  swing. Nothing I heard tonight has changed my vote for what I think  will make us a stronger tribe moving forward. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, if this is true, one of the twosomes is  about to be broken up. <br/>I don't see it as a two,  a one and a two at this point. I think the relationships have formed over the last five days  that it could be any three people. <br/>Jeff: All right. Let's find out where the three goes. Time to vote. Roark, you're up. <br/>Next time don't come for me. <br/>I’m outsmarting miss  smarty pants. <br/>I’m outsmarting miss  smarty pants. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote Chrissy. Roark. Chrissy. Two votes Chrissy. Roark. We're tied. Two votes Roark, two votes Chrissy, one vote left. Fifth person voted out of "Survivor: Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers", Roark. You need to bring me your torch. Roark, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Jeff: It's time for you to go. Well, the stated goal of tonight's tribal was a stronger tribe,  but with a divided vote, clearly the first step will be repair. Good luck with that. Grab your torches and head back to camp. Good night. Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. Captioned by media access group at wgbh  Jeff: Text time on "Survivor," texs are high. <br/>Why didn't you tell me? You just wrote Chrissy's name down. <br/>Because that's what I thought you wanted. <br/>I said I wasn't going to  cry, but it's rough. <br/>Jeff: And it all comes crashing down. <br/>Oh, my God. Cole, are you okay? <br/>I’m not ready the play  this game without Cole. <br/>It was a great experience. I would tell any super fan to do it, but I’m bummed. I felt like I had a lot more in me, and I suppose I trusted the  wrong people. The problem is it was my first tribal, so I can't tell who voted  with me. I always think there is something someone can do, and evidently  I didn't do that. I own that.
