<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor... Drop your buffs. ...after the two tribes merged...  One big, happy family. <br/>Probst: ...James had the only two hidden immunity idols. <br/>James, he's almost guaranteed himself in the top five right now. <br/>That's funny. I'm on Survivor with two idols. <br/>Probst: And the members of the former Zhan Hu Tribe were on the chopping  block. <br/>The plan was to get rid of Peih-Gee, then Erik and Frosti after that. <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge, there was a school[1]yard  pick where everyone was chosen to compete except Denise. <br/>We're going to go with Courtney because she's light. <br/>Probst: You will not participate in this challenge. You'll not be eligible for the reward. Take a spot on the bench. And back at camp, she was feeling left out. <br/>Are they going to do that when it comes down to the final seven? Am I going to be the one that's going to go home before JR? And I going to be the one that goes home before James? I don't want to be that person. <br/>Probst: And Courtney's allegiance to the Fei Long alliance was also wavering. <br/>You got to watch Courtney, because she is a loose cannon. She does stray off and fall in love with anybody that floats and smiles at  her. <br/>Probst: So Peih-Gee jumped at the small opening by trying to lure Denise and  Courtney into her alliance. <br/>There's five of us here. If we all band together, it'll be four to five; we can pick them off one by  one. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, Courtney was the last one sitting. Courtney wins immunity! Facing tribal council, Jean[1]Robert  discovered that James had both idols. <br/>This is the guy who's favored to win every challenge from here out. <br/>Probst: So he came up with a plan to take out his closest ally. <br/>We could blindside him tonight, because he will not pull out the idol tonight. <br/>Probst: But Todd turned the tables on Jean-Robert. <br/>I think our best bet is Jean[1]Robert. <br/>Yeah, I don't want... I don't like breaking the system. <br/>You don't want to tell Denise or no? <br/>No, hell no. <br/>Probst: At tribal council, James took the risk of not using his idol... James. ...and almost paid the price. He received three votes and Peih-Gee received one. One vote left. But in the end, Jean-Robert was dealt a losing hand. Jean-Robert, the tribe has spoken. Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>I had a narrow escape last night. I had three votes. I mean, now all I have to do is stay on my Ps and Qs. But, you know, the odds of me actually being kicked off with the two idols  are not that hot. So from now on, I'll have them with me on tribal council. ( clearing throat ) * Good morning good morning! * I come to say good morning good morning * Good morning to you! <br/>Good morning. <br/>That was beautiful, by the way. <br/>Everyone, it's Christmas! There's no Jean-Robert in the bed! Camp life without John-Robert is much nicer, and I think that everyone else  is also kind of happy to have him gone. Jean-Robert is such a complainer and demanding people to fetch him things and  just... just generally unpleasant. <br/>Denise was, like, shooting daggers at myself and Amanda because she was mad. By blindsiding Jean-Robert, we had to blindside her too, and it could come  back to get us. <br/>We have a plan here that the former Fei Long, we're going to vote out the  Zhan Hu people. So last night at tribal council, I went with the original plan. I voted Peih-Gee, like we were supposed to. But I guess at the last moment, everybody changed their minds, and half the  tribe voted for Jean-Robert. It kind of makes me feel on the outside, because I had an opportunity to  switch over to Zhan Hu, and I decided to stay with the group that I'm close  to. And I still get backstabbed. It's a hard position for me right now. <br/>You okay? The thing with last night, I don't know what happened. Everybody freaked out because...  But they were supposed to tell you at the end. <br/>I mean, I felt like an idiot. I'm the only one that voted for Peih-Gee. At the last second, they should have told me. <br/>That's what the plan was, honestly. <br/>You know, I mean, how I do feel at the end now? Do I feel like I'm the next one to go because I'm an idiot? <br/>No, you're still safe. Just don't... we need to hold this together. <br/>James has two hidden immunity idols. It's smart to stick with him. I mean, you never know what's going to happen, but it is hard to trust people  in this game. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION ( theme song playing  )  You want the fire died down a little or...  No, I'm about to pick it back up. <br/>You want it really hot. <br/>Yeah, thanks for telling me. You're wanting to micromanaging me. <br/>I'm just excited, okay? I'm just excited to eat. <br/>Oh, my gosh, Jean-Robert was annoying, and now he's gone, but all of a sudden  Peih-Gee decided to step in and take his place. <br/>I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to micromanage you. <br/>Even though Peih-Gee's not playing a very smart game, but the thing is is  Courtney, she's tight with Frosti, and she's flirting with him. <br/>I know. No hot dogs, but pretty close. <br/>I mean, it's scary. It really is. Because you never know if she's going to want to twist or turn, and that kind  of worries me. <br/>Tree mail! And we have a drum. <br/>You guys ready? <br/>Yes. <br/>"An experience of a lifetime in a truly magical place, a feast of sights  to feed your soul, and you'll also feed your face. Again you must divide to conquer. You better be on the ball. If you drum up some enthusiasm, you might just win it all."  That drum is wicked. <br/>I just want to win. I just hate that, like, I'm the most losingest survivor left in this game  right now. Like, I've lost the most challenges out of everybody. Like, it kind of sucks, and that makes me want to win even more. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's reward challenge. <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, you will be divided into two teams of four. Using four different-sized drums, you must keep a ball in the air by bouncing  it from one drum to another as you navigate through a series of obstacles. Along the way, you'll pass through two gates. If you drop the ball, you've got to return to the start or the previous gate. When you reach the end, you must bounce the ball in a finish bin, then race  back to the start. First team to get three balls in their bin wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: The winning team of four will be treated to a spectacular cruise on  the Lee River. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: One of the most beautiful spots in China. You'll have a nice dinner, spend the night on the boat, return to camp in the  morning. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: We're going to randomly choose captains. This is a school-yard pick. Peih-Gee, you're the captain of the red team. Erik, you're the captain of the yellow team. You will rock, paper, scissor to see who picks first. <br/>One, two, three. <br/>Probst: Scissor cuts paper. Peih-Gee, you get the first choice. <br/>James. <br/>Probst: Peih-Gee doesn't even hesitate. Peih-Gee selects James. <br/>Probst: Erik, your choice. <br/>Frosti. <br/>Probst: Erik selects Frosti. James, your choice. <br/>Todd. <br/>Probst: Todd joins James and Peih-Gee. Frosti, who you want? <br/>I think we'll go with Amanda. <br/>Probst: Amanda coming over to join Erik and Frosti. <br/>Probst: Todd you have the last choice between Courtney and Denise. <br/>Denise. <br/>Probst: Todd takes Denise. Courtney will join Erik, Frosti, and Amanda. We have our two teams. I'll give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. For a cruise down the Lee River, a nice meal, and a good night's sleep. Survivors ready? Go! Both groups off to a good, smooth start. Todd and Erik taking it all the way up to the first obstacle. Going to have to pass sooner or later. Erik passes to Frosti. Red team loses it. You got to go back to the start. Yellow group's made it through the first gate. If you drop the ball, that will be your starting point. Frosti almost losing it. Off his head, he does. Back to this mat here. There is definitely a learning curve to this challenge. James loses it. Red heads back to the start again. Nice pass, Erik keeping it alive. They're through the second gate. <br/>Okay, guys, don't panic. Here we go. <br/>Probst: Yellow getting very close. <br/>Erik. <br/>Probst: Frosti back to Erik. Now they just got to get it in the finish bin. And they do! Nice teem teamwork. Yellow scores one! You need three to win. Denise, Peih-Gee, Todd, James, having a tough time getting the hang of this. Whereas Courtney, Erik, Frosti, and Amanda having much more success. <br/>Let me know of any obstacles. <br/>Just watch out for the mud, obstacle. <br/>Probst: Both teams at the first obstacle. It's about teamwork. Todd goes to Peih-Gee. Peih-Gee keeps it alive. <br/>You got it, Todd. <br/>Probst: Red doing a good job. Both teams go through the first gate. Frosti passes back to Erik. <br/>Toss it to me. <br/>Probst: Todd goes to Peih[1]Gee. Peih-Gee keeps it alive. <br/>Todd, you ready? Take over. <br/>Probst: Red misses again. Frosti to Erik, a nice save by Erik. Another nice save by Erik. Yellow again very close. Yellow very close to scoring their second point. Yellow leads two-zip! Red team got to make this one count. Peih-Gee keeping it alive. Todd with a nice save. <br/>Get over the line. Get over the thing. <br/>Probst: Red trying to score their first point. Todd to Peih-Gee, red very close. But they lose it. <br/>Grab the ball! Get back! Come on! <br/>Probst: Erik leading yellow up the hill with that third and final ball. Red team still on their first, starting to panic. James, too hard, Peih-Gee can't get it. Yellow's making good ground with that third and final ball. They've got a good rhythm going. <br/>Get it! Get it! <br/>Probst: Red close, but misses again. Red has to go back to the mat. As yellow heads up the hill with that third and final ball, they seem to have  figured this out. Erik to Frosti. This could be it. Big reward on the line if they get it in. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: And they do! Frosti, Amanda, Erik, and Courtney cruising down the Lee River. Okay, Erik, Frosti, Courtney, Amanda, you will leave from here, be taken to  the Lee River. You will return to camp in the morning. James, Peih-Gee, Denise, Todd, your looks say it all. I got nothing for you. Get your stuff. Head back to camp. The reward is waiting. Head out and have a good time. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Uh-uh. I did not see your ass strolling back to the mat every time we dropped the  ball. <br/>Uh-huh. I'm the one who was dropping the ball today? <br/>No, I was the only one. <br/>I'm not saying it's your fault, James. I'm not saying... no... what I'm saying is... I want... Can I finish? Can I please finish? <br/>No, you can't, because I don't care. Please stop messing with me. Because every time you bring something up, I will quickly blast you back and  make you look quite silly. <br/>Yeah? <br/>Because every time you open your mouth, you're just speaking nonsense. That's why you lose. <br/>Really? My ass wasn't strolling back to the mat after ever time. I raced back to that damn mat. You know, I need to take a walk right now. <br/>Peih-Gee, she's just stupid. I mean, she really came to me and said that I was the reason why they didn't...  it's all my fault. Maybe she's the problem. She's never won anything. I mean, maybe that's the sign. You know, not everybody is crazy. You're the crazy one. <br/>I'm probably pissed off that we lost the challenge, and I'm taking it out on  James, but I'm the only person who wasn't won any reward challenges. I'm pissed about it. Like, I'd love to go on a reward, but I don't have a single ally here. I don't have anybody. I'm in, like, a really bad position. It's probably not smart to go around picking fights with people, but I can't,  like, keep my mouth shut sometimes. <br/>Oh, I didn't hear what she was saying, but I heard her yelling. <br/>She came over to me, saying it's my fault we lost. <br/>It's your fault? <br/>Yeah, my fault, because I let the ball drop...  She dropped the ball a couple times. Everybody did. <br/>Everybody dropped the ball. It just wasn't our day. But that thing... she... ooh. Is she serious? Is she serious? <br/>I don't like her attitude at all. <br/>She really came over here and was blaming me. That's some nerve. <br/>It is nerve. It's crazy. <br/>That's why we need to focus. We need to keep trying to focus, and we all need to focus and just pick them  people off. I'm trying to keep away from temptation from Zhan Hu. Them little pretty boys and the little annoying little girl, they are still  enemies. They're still trying to infiltrate the force to get where we already have  predestined ourselves to be. Amanda is going to be all right. Courtney, she's flaky, but she's going to fall in line. Her... hopefully her and what's his name don't have a big romance tonight,  which might happen. That would hurt. It makes no sense for us to mess it up now, but it's so human nature. I mean, it's right there in front of you. Just don't eat the damn apple. Be naked and be happy. Don't eat that damn apple. I hope that Courtney don't flip. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Because Courtney would do that for love. <br/>This is probably the worst day that I can have out here. People are freaking out around camp, and the four people I get along best  with are out having a good time on a boat somewhere. Today sucks. <br/>All right, everyone, cheers to us. Cheers! <br/>Cheers. <br/>What great win today. <br/>Yeah. <br/>What a good win. I haven't won hardly any challenges since I've been out here, so I was amped  up to win. The reward was for this cruise on the Lee River. It was spectacular. I felt like it was a pretty cool group of people, and you know, of course it  was a good opportunity to just get to know them a little better and try and,  you know, develop relationships. I'm just wondering what it's like back at camp. <br/>I like Peih-Gee. I just...  I wanted to like her. <br/>She's making me annoyed with her. <br/>She is cool, like, when she's relaxing and just kind of hanging. <br/>Yeah, but she's...  She's totally cool. <br/>She's too intense right now, and I don't... I don't like that. <br/>She doesn't want to lose, and I think she feels like she's powerless, but,  like, she's made a series of poor decisions. <br/>As much as I'm, like, still basically on Peih-Gee's side, I don't mind her  being talked about negatively simply because it means if she's getting talked  about, then I'm not. <br/>Here's to us. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Because we're still here. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Yay! <br/>Yay! <br/>And on a boat. <br/>This is definitely where I want to be. <br/>And the night is young. <br/>The night is young. <br/>And I'm feeling quite jolly already. <br/>Yay! Jolly! I love my Frosti. I love my Frosti. I don't really understand my relationship with Frosti. He's young. He's only 20. And he's kind of cute. He just wants to play. I love our reward. The path of righteousness has led us in the right direction. <br/>I like Courtney a lot. And I think both of us feel that, and that's good. She's a really attractive girl. She's smart. She's way out of my league, but having somebody that you're just comfortable  around is really nice. <br/>Look how high that is straight up. <br/>Oh, my God, unreal. This is like the greatest adventure, like, in China possible. Oh, my gosh, it's a goat, you guys! I'm not even kidding. <br/>Where? <br/>That black thing right there. <br/>And the white thing. ( Erik imitating a goat )  That's good. Not only does it sound good. You do the face. ( Erik imitating a goat ) Erik, stop hitting on the goats. They're a couple. ( Erik imitating a goat )  I feel like we had a great time together. Maybe it helped me in Courtney and Amanda's eyes, and maybe that's enough to  at least save me another round. ( Erik imitating a goat )  I think that's the greatest impression I've ever heard. Congratulations, Erik. <br/>I do what I can. I do what I can. <br/>I really like Erik. I know he's here to play the game as well, but I think he's adorable, and I  definitely want to see him around as long as possible. I really like him. <br/>Oh, my God! Is that fried chicken? Oh, my god! This is the greatest day of my life. What is that? Mashed potatoes. Thank you! <br/>Thank you! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Fried chicken! <br/>Erik, he is a threat, and he's been doing a really good job of getting close  to Amanda and Courtney. I don't know, it does worry me, just because... I mean, there's no reason  they couldn't be like, "Oh, well, why don't we just take Erik instead of  Frosti?" It's scary. I don't want to be replaced. <br/>Someone's coming in. Hey, bitches, welcome home! <br/>Hey. <br/>We want to hear all about it. <br/>Juicy details. <br/>We had Chinese food, the same thing that we had...  Chinese food. <br/>Oh, it was so fun. Talk it up. We need details. <br/>We lied to everyone because if we would have told them we would have had  fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and bread and butter, everyone would have  hated us for sure. <br/>It was a nice cruise though. <br/>No, it was really cool. <br/>It was nice, and the scenery was beautiful. <br/>It was really pretty. <br/>It was nice. <br/>What's been going on around here, just the same old, trying to get food and  water? <br/>Pretty much. <br/>Todd, we missed you. <br/>It's so nice to have you guys back, though. I mean, this is the thing. Like, you know, believe it or not, Peih-Gee just lost it and just started  screaming at James. <br/>When you guys got back? <br/>Yeah. Screaming at James, like, "You can't bounce a ball on a drum and..."  da, da, da, da. She freaked out on him. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>He was like, "Bitch, what are you talking about?"  That sounds like a Jean[1]Robert  move. <br/>Yeah, it is a Jean-Robert move. <br/>Peih-Gee is not necessarily in most people's good graces right now, so  hopefully I'll be safe, unless Peih-Gee wins immunity, and then it's a whole  new story. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Probst: First thing's first. Courtney, time to give it up. <br/>Oh, and it looked so cute on her too. <br/>Probst: Once again immunity is back up for grabs. Today's immunity challenge will test your memory. You will each have a series of Chinese zodiac symbols in front of you. Each round, I will call out a list of those symbols. You must then use your knife to stab them in the correct order. Get it right, you stay in. Get it wrong, you're out. Last person left standing wins immunity, is guaranteed a one[1]in-seven  shot at winning this game. Losers, tribal council tonight, somebody will be going home. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: If you feel so comfortable you don't think you need immunity tonight,  you can opt not to play in the challenge and instead...  No. <br/>Probst: ...you can eat. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh! <br/>That's okay. <br/>Don't do that. <br/>That is so wrong. <br/>Probst: Cheeseburgers. French fries. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Cold drinks. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: And all the fixings. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>That is mean! <br/>Probst: I'm going to give each of you a white coin and a black coin. Black means you want to eat. White means you want to play. I'll hand them out. Don't do anything with them yet. Keep them both together. Make sure they're separated. Black means you want to eat. White means you want to play. This is a simple case of temptation. So now I want everybody to choose one coin, put it in your right hand, put  your right hand out. Three, two, one, reveal. Courtney's decided she wants to eat. Todd is going to eat. Denise is going to eat. And James is going to eat. Take a spot at your feast bench. Peih-Gee, Frosti, Amanda, and Erik are playing to win this game. All right, here's how it will work. When we start, you guys can begin eating. You can eat for as long as the challenge takes, until we have a winner. The challenge is now beginning. Dig in. Here we go, first round. Tiger, rabbit, rat, monkey, dog. Go. Let's see how we do. Tiger, rat is wrong. Erik, take a spot. Tiger, rabbit, rat, monkey, dog is right. Amanda is still in. Tiger, rabbit, rat, monkey, dog is right. Peih-Gee is still in. Tiger, rabbit, rat, monkey, dog. Frosti is still in. Erik, that has got to be tough now. You didn't make it one round, and you're looking at cheeseburgers, fries,  fixings. <br/>Can't do anything about it. I'm going to make the most of it, sit here, and smell it. <br/>Probst: Courtney, how's that burger? <br/>Great. <br/>Probably the best food I've ever had in my life right now. <br/>Probst: We are down to three. Next round: rat, ram, dragon, rooster, ram. Frosti struggling to get that last one. You're committed to what you have. <br/>Come on, Frosti. Go, Frosti. <br/>Probst: Frosti makes a choice. Let's find out if he's right. Rat, ram, dragon, rooster, ram. Rat, ram, dragon, rat is wrong. Amanda has it wrong. Rat, ram, dragon, rooster, ram. Peih-Gee has it right. That means Amanda, you can take a seat. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: It comes down to this. Peih-Gee has it right. Frosti, if you have it wrong, Peih-Gee wins immunity. <br/>I'm going crazy. I'm losing my mind. <br/>Probst: Rat, ram, dragon, rooster, ram is what you need to have to stay alive. Rat, ram, dragon, rooster, ram. You got it right. <br/>Yay! <br/>Probst: You're still alive. We are down to two-- immunity and a guarantee of a one-in[1]seven  shot of winning this game. Here we go. Snake, rat, rabbit, tiger, rooster, ram. <br/>Come on, Frosti. <br/>Probst: Snake, rat, rabbit, tiger, rooster, ram. What are you upset about? <br/>I don't know. I think I lost my mind with Frosti. <br/>Probst: Snake, rat, rabbit, tiger, rooster, ram. I think you got it right. Peih-Gee has it right again. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Frosti, you have to have it right to stay alive in this. Snake, the second one was rat. You have rabbit. It's over. Peih-Gee wins immunity. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Congratulations. And with that, stop eating. Whatever you got in your mouth, you can finish. What's in your hands you need to set down. Give you a minute to swallow. <br/>I'm covered in mayonnaise. <br/>It's on your leg. <br/>Probst: Peih-Gee, the only thing on day 27 better than a cheeseburger is this  right here. <br/>That's right, baby. <br/>Probst: Individual immunity guarantees you safe tonight at tribal council, one-in-seven  shot at winning this game. Frosti, Todd, Amanda, Erik, Denise, Courtney, and James, one of the seven you  are going home tonight. See you at tribal. Head on back. <br/>How much did you guys eat? <br/>I had two burgers and a ton of fries and two things of cola. And I hated myself for that. <br/>It's hard to know that I took a risk, made a sacrifice, and nothing really  came out of it. I am upset that James, Denise, Todd, and Courtney sat out. Like, we're here for 12 more days. You can't wait 12 days for a cheeseburger? <br/>Frosti, you fought hard. I did terrible. <br/>Not winning immunity today and having Peih-Gee win means that we can't vote  her out. So I think Erik kind of already knows that he's on the chopping block. <br/>Well, if I go tonight, good luck to you. <br/>If I go tonight, good luck to you. And we still didn't get cheeseburgers. <br/>Since Peih-Gee won immunity, that means Frosti and I are kind of the obvious  ones to go, you know, probably going to be one of us. And Frosti, I feel like he's... somehow, you know, he's worked his way... I  think he's in good with Todd and Amanda and Courtney. So it definitely makes it seem like Frosti might be higher up the ladder than  he once was. But then again, you know, I'm tight with that group now. So maybe that puts me up the ladder as well. So we'll see. <br/>We have to be careful with Erik, because he's not like Peih-Gee. He's not overbearing. He's not abrasive. But he's really good at making... especially the girls. <br/>He's smooth. <br/>They love him. <br/>And he plays up the good old country boy from Tennessee. <br/>I mean, he's a great guy. And, like, he's awesome to have around, but just got to be careful. <br/>It's like, "Here you go, have a million dollars, Erik." Tonight's  vote's killer. I mean, Erik, if he makes it to the end, hands down, he's guaranteed a  million dollars. But Frosti's a big threat. You watch him perform in any of the challenges, and he is great, you know. And that kind of worries me. So I don't know what I'm going to do. It's a toss-up. Frosti and Erik? <br/>One of them guys is leaving. <br/>Has to go. We have to get rid of one of those two. I mean, I love Frosti. I'll write his name down. Courtney is really tight with him. If we have to, we pull her in to get rid of Frosti. She'll vote for Frosti. <br/>I'm not sure you want to trust her, though. I mean, she thinks her Frosti's with her. <br/>Courtney...  We can convince Courtney. <br/>You sure? She's loving the hell out of Frosti. <br/>If she can't realize that, if she really can't realize that, maybe we should  turn it around and get rid of her. <br/>The last tribal council we went to, I thought everybody was voting for  Peih-Gee. It turned out everybody was voting for JR. Tonight I really don't feel paranoid, because at least I think I know who  everybody's voting for. It's either going to be Frosti or it's going to be Courtney that goes tonight. <br/>Obviously, and it sucks, but what are we at, eight? Get rid of Erik or Frosti. <br/>So Erik or Frosti. <br/>Has to, right? James and Denise are scared to death that you would not be willing to vote  against Frosti. <br/>Oh, really? <br/>Yeah. Yes. And would you? <br/>Frosti is kind of like my little Munchkin, and you know, everyone's kind of  worried about me because they know that he's, you know, like, my good friend. <br/>You've seen him compete. I love the kid, but we don't have a choice, right? <br/>We'll see how it goes. It really does, like, strategically make a difference whether or not, you  know, I go with the group on this one or I don't go with the group on this  one. So I don't know. I mean, honestly, I don't know who I'll vote for. <br/>James and Denise were very worried about Courtney and her friendship with  Frosti. I'm worried. I mean, we just don't know what to expect. She could literally take a sharp turn right at any moment. You know, I may have to vote for her. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury, Jaime and Jean-Robert,  voted out at the last tribal council. Let's talk about today's immunity challenge. James, of all the people that would choose to eat over fighting for immunity,  I have to say you surprised me the most. When you saw that plate of cheeseburgers, what was your initial thought? <br/>Attack. ( laughter ) I ate seven of them. <br/>Probst: You ate set of the 12? <br/>I ate seven burgers. And I would have eaten that last one. I'm not playing. I was hungry. Yes, I have a strong ability to win, and if I would have competed, I would  have competed with my whole heart, but I'm telling you, it was meat, man. <br/>Probst: Todd, you have a one[1]in-even  shot if you win today's challenge, and yet you opted for food. <br/>The second you took the lid off of those burgers and fries, fat kid inside of  Todd said, "Food, eat, you are so hungry," you know? And it's very risky putting yourself in that situation, especially when you  tell yourself you would never do it. <br/>Probst: Frosti, why did you choose to not eat? <br/>Well, I know that being here, there's always a chance that you could go home,  no matter how comfortable you feel, and that's a chance that some people  decided to take. But I want to know that I've done everything I can to do my best, to try my  hardest, so that if I do go home, I know that it's not because I didn't do  everything I could. <br/>Probst: Erik, of the four people that chose to sit out, do you think it's a sign  that they are comfortable enough with their status in the tribe that they can  eat and still be here at the end of this tribal? <br/>I knew I had to do the challenge, so that definitely draws a distinction  between where I am and where the people that were eating are. <br/>Probst: Where are you in this tribe? <br/>I feel like I'm honestly somewhere at the bottom, and frankly, tonight I feel  like I'm very far at the bottom. There's a chance I could make it through tonight, but I'm not necessarily  planning on it. <br/>Probst: We're at a point in the game where there are two different types of  relationships: strategy relationships, then relationships that might extend  after the game. Amanda, are those two relationships starting to butt heads yet when it comes  to who you vote out? <br/>It's a hard thing, having friendships and then trying to play this game,  because they don't always follow the same path. So it's a hard thing to juggle. <br/>Probst: Denise, if you make a friendship with somebody out here, do you  expect a little more loyalty than somebody that maybe they don't like? <br/>I mean, you would hope that the loyalty would be there, but there is no  loyalty in a game like this. There is no real down-to-the[1]bottom  trust. I mean, it's a game. I mean, you hope that the friendships that you make and the bonds that you  create over all this time will last in the end. <br/>Probst: Frosti, what does it say about you that you're still here after being  selected from Fei Long presumably with the idea to get rid of? <br/>Well, I do believe that forming the relationships that I did with the whole  tribe really did help me. And yes, sometimes you do have to hurt people that you've gotten close to. But it is a game, and everyone understands that. And sometimes in games, people get hurt. <br/>Probst: Erik, does it ever feel personal? <br/>Yeah. I mean, it's hard, because I feel like I've meant to make friends too, and at  some point, there's only so much I can do, you know, on the chopping block. But of course, as far as, like, trying to scheme and, like, get myself in  good with a select few, although somewhat necessary, also can be very  detrimental. So I've really tried to be careful, and you know, I have very few options at  this point tonight, but.... <br/>Probst: Okay, it is time to get to the vote. Peih-Gee, I don't even have to ask. I know you're not giving up that necklace. Peih-Gee is safe. You cannot vote for Peih-Gee. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Todd, you're up. <br/>One of us will be eating cheeseburgers before the other. Neither of us deserved it. <br/>It's you and me tonight, bro. Nothing personal. <br/>I think you're an amazing person. I'm sorry. I hope we can be friends later. Bye. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. If anyone has the hidden immunity idol, now is the time to play it. I'll read the votes. First vote, Frosti. Erik. Frosti. Two votes Frosti, one vote Erik. Frosti. Three votes Frosti, one vote Erik. Frosti, it's four votes Frosti. Ninth person voted out and the third member of our jury, Frosti. That's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Frosti, the tribe has spoken. <br/>With cheeseburgers still on their breath. <br/>Probst: Time for you to go. Well, you've made it a long ways in this game, but there are still 12 days  left. Now, more than ever, the ability to adapt moment to moment is what's going to  keep you in this game. We're going to test that right now. Tonight you will not be heading directly back to camp. We have more business to attend to here.

I'm not doing all this stuff by myself anymore. They're going to pull the rope with me, or they're all going to die. <br/>Probst: And Todd takes a stand. <br/>I have a very, very strong opinion, and I'm going to knock you down if I have  to. You got to watch your mouth, dude. <br/>I expected some people to kind of backstab, but I didn't expect it right now. I got beat by the tiny flight attendant, the sassy New York waitress, and the  lady with the mullet. But you know, I wanted to prove that somebody who is younger, smaller could  come out here and do the same job that anyone else can do, and I have proved  that.
