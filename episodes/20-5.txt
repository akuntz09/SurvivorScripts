<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously, on Survivor: On day ten, when the Heroes discovered  a clue to the hidden immunity idol...  "An immunity idol is hidden at your camp."  Probst: ...the entire tribe scattered across the beach...  Who's walking down that way? <br/>Probst: ...each person selfishly looking for the idol alone. Tom was the one to find it. <br/>I have the immunity idol, but I'm still a target, because they know it's in  my possession. <br/>Probst: Conversely, the Villains agreed to stick together and ignore the clue  entirely. <br/>It's not fair for one person to have an immunity idol. <br/>Probst: Except for Russell, who searched for the idol but couldn't find it. And instead found himself on the outs with his tribe. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, Boston Rob once again led the Villains to  victory. Villains win immunity! At the Heroes' camp, J.T. agreed to vote with Cirie and the majority of the tribe to take out Tom. <br/>I want Tom to go. <br/>Probst: But at Tribal Council, J.T. betrayed his alliance and voted for Cirie. <br/>Jeff, I have something that I was hoping not to use. <br/>Probst: So when Tom played the hidden immunity idol, Cirie was sent home. Cirie, the tribe has spoken. I would say that qualifies as your first blindside. 16 are left. 16 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Tonight, J.T. is a Hero. I really believed my days were done on the beach, but J.T. did it. At this point, it's all about strategy. They've made it very clear they wanted me and Tom gone. We're not gone yet. We're not gone yet. We don't plan on going anywhere. We don't plan on going anywhere. <br/>Cirie's game's always been she stays loyal until things get rough after the  merge. And the way things are going, it's gonna get rough for us. And I hope everybody realizes I did it for the team and not for me. <br/>I'm a little pissed off right now. [chuckles] I'm a lot pissed off right now. Don't know about J.T. as much as Don't know about J.T. as much as I did a few hours ago. I did a few hours ago. <br/>They think I saved them. I didn't. I got rid of Cirie when I had the chance. And I swear, I will never, never turn on you guys. Never. <br/>Really? <br/>I swear. I swear, Amanda. I would never lie to you. I would never lie to you. I swear. You don't believe me? I swear. You don't believe me? I swear. <br/>Okay. J.T. can tell me everything he wants to tell me, but I see right through him. In the back of my mind, I know that he will lie and he makes alliances like  they're, you know, yesterday's news. I think he's made 20 alliances already. If he wants to play this game, game on. game on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. [theme song playing] [theme song playing] [theme song playing]  And flex every muscle. <br/>And flex every muscle. <br/>And flex every muscle. And pull. And pull. The key is making your mind tell you body to flex every muscle. I led the tribe out to the beach this morning to do some dragon-slayer chi;  my own special form of meditation and movement. Out to this side. Move your arms like this. It's complete body control. If fuses everything together. If fuses everything together. [Coach humming] [Coach humming] It just basically tells your mind and your  body to get on the same page. Keep the pressure on the fists. And they all seemed willing to go. Everybody went except Russell. <br/>Everybody this morning walks out on the beach doing a little Coach chi in a  circle. You know, all that meditating crap. [Coach humming] While they meditating, getting ready for the challenge-- I  guess that's what they were meditating for-- I'm looking meditating for-- I'm  looking for the hidden immunity idol. for the hidden immunity idol. You know, it's a very important tool, so I'm-a get it. tool, so I'm-a get it. I'm gonna find it. I'm gonna find it. It was right in my face. It was right in my face. That's what I was afraid of. That's what I was afraid of. Today, everything changes. Everything. Rob's not in control of this game right now. This is my key. This is my key right here. This is my key right here. And here it goes again. And here it goes again. And here it goes again. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Villains, getting your first look at the new Hero tribe. Cirie voted out at the last Cirie voted out at the last Tribal Council. Tribal Council. All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, three members of each tribe will battle to  retrieve balls in a pit. Will then toss them to your tribemates up on a platform, who will attempt to  shoot the balls into a basket. Each time you get a ball in the basket, you score a point for your tribe. First tribe to score two points wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Hell, yeah. <br/>Probst: The winning tribe will leave here and be taken to a beautiful  watering hole, and you will enjoy a feast... of... chocolate: chocolate bars,  chocolate cake,  I like cake. <br/>Probst: ...chocolate chip cookies, chocolate milk. [Jerri laughs]  That's the only thing I crave out here. <br/>Probst: To make it a little more enticing, I want to whet your appetite with  just a little taste of chocolate. <br/>Oh! Oh, my God! That's kinda cool. Oh, wow. <br/>I'm watching my weight. <br/>Oh, Amanda. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, geez. Oh, geez. <br/>There, Jeff. <br/>Oh, geez. Oh, wow. <br/>They don't want it? <br/>We'll take theirs. <br/>Probst: Colby, you have a look on your face like this is annoying or somehow  insulting. I handed you the plate, and you were, like, "I don't want this."  I'm not annoyed with you. I'm ready to get to the challenge. <br/>Probst: Free offer of chocolate. I'm just curious...  Don't need it. Let's go. <br/>Probst: I got the message, brother, we'll go when I'm ready. <br/>Oh! [chuckles]  Probst: Rupert, why nobody eating chocolate on the Heroes? What kind of message are you sending to the Villains? <br/>Hopefully, focus. We don't care about the reward. We just want to win the the challenge. <br/>We al, we're always focused when it comes to a challenge. That's why we keep winning. [Rupert growls softly]  Probst: All right, Villains, you are sitting out three people. It has to be three women. Sandra, Courtney and Parvati sitting out for the Villains. Heroes, you're sitting out one one person. It has to be a man. <br/>I'll sit out. I'll sit out. <br/>Probst: Colby gonna sit this one out for the Heroes. Sit-outs, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize, minute to strategize, we'll  get started. we'll get started. All right, in the pit for the Villains, it's Danielle, Tyson and Russell  taking on Candice, James and Tom. Up on the platform it's Jerri, Coach and Rob for the Villains taking on J.T.,  Amanda and Rupert. <br/>Let's go, Heroes. <br/>Probst: We're playing to two. Survivors ready? Go! Gotta get the ball and get it back to your tribemates on the platform. Heroes have all three balls right off the bat. J.T. just misses. Rupert-- nice little floater. <br/>That a way, J.T., get close. Come on, focus. <br/>Probst: Russell hanging with James. &gt;&gt;That a boy, James. <br/>Ow! <br/>Probst: James takes a hard hit. Big battle down below. Danielle comes up with it. <br/>You all right, James? <br/>Oh-oh, something's broke. <br/>Probst: Hold up. Medical, come on in. <br/>Come on, baby, you're all right. <br/>Probst: Hold up. Give him a little space. Let the docs take a look. <br/>Does that hurt if I do that? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm gonna bend it. Can you bend it back? <br/>It just buckled in. <br/>Is that all right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Claudia, what are you looking for right now? <br/>We're worried that he might have pulled the lateral collateral ligament or  the medial collateral ligament. In which case, it looks stable at the moment, and he's not in pain. He might have just sprained a muscle. So now we'll get him up and see So now we'll get him up and see if he can  walk on it. if he can walk on it. Speaking of that, move your hand up there. <br/>I could walk it out? Is that what you're saying? <br/>Let's see what you can do. <br/>This is weird. It don't hurt. All right, I'm good. [James gasps]  Maybe not. <br/>You're not gonna be able to walk on it. <br/>Probst: Mmm...  He's out. It keeps kind of popping out inside there. Sit down and we'll see what we can do, but...  Probst: But for this challenge...? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Yeah, you're out. <br/>Yeah, for this challenge, he's out. <br/>Probst: Okay, all right. <br/>Another tough challenge, physical just like we wanted, but right off the bat,  James got hurt. I'm not sure what he's done to his knee, but it doesn't look good. If James is pulled from this game, you know, a lot of my strategy's changed. <br/>Probst: All right, due to James' injury, James is out of the challenge, which  means the Heroes will be playing with five people instead of six. So whenever Candice and Tom are matched up, you will be one person short. I'm gonna start from the top. Survivors ready? Go! Right off the bat, Tom gets two for the Heroes. Coach just misses for the Villains. J.T. with a nice toss. Just misses for the Heroes. <br/>J.T.! <br/>Block it! <br/>Probst: And that scores for Amanda! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Heroes score! Switch it up. People in the pit are now shooting. People shooting are now in the pit. <br/>Nice work! <br/>Probst: We will rotate every round. Heroes win the first point and lead 1-zip. <br/>Let's go, Heroes. Come on. <br/>Probst: Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Get that ball! <br/>Probst: Big battle! J.T. takes down Boston Rob. <br/>That a way, J.T.! <br/>Probst: Heroes come up with two of the balls. <br/>Come on, boys! <br/>Probst: Tom just misses for the Heroes. Candice just misses. Tyson just short. <br/>Get it, Rob. <br/>Probst: Another battle between J. T. and Rob, Coach and Rupert. Rob and J.T. going at it. J.T. not giving up that ball. Russell gets pulled off the platform! Rupert comes up with it for the Heroes. Another miss by the Villains. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Tom just misses. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Candice just misses. <br/>Danielle, come on. Don't hold onto the ball. <br/>Probst: Danielle just misses for the Villains. Villains have to score here to stay in this. Coach gets hit hard by J.T. Tyson tries to lock one in, and it works. Whoa! Stop! Stop! Stop! <br/>I did not mean to do that! You okay? <br/>Yeah, I'm fine. He socked me. <br/>Oh, like I meant to do that. <br/>Whatever, dude, whatever. <br/>Fine. <br/>Not bleeding. <br/>Probst: Here we go. We're tied 1-1. <br/>Let's go, Heroes. Come on. <br/>Probst: Whoever gets this point here wins a big chocolate feast. Survivors ready? Go! Big scramble for the ball. Russell comes up with two for the Villains. Tom comes up with one for the Heroes. Boston Rob tosses one and just misses. Rupert can't hold onto it. Danielle gets it to Tyson. Tom battling for that ball. Clears the way for Candice to get it. Boston Rob floats one, but J.T. blocks it. <br/>Oh! That was gonna go in! <br/>Probst: Boston Rob blocks J.T. J.T. now has a shot for the Heroes. In and out! <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Jerri scores for the Villains! Villains win reward! Villains win reward! [Villains cheering] [Villains cheering] [Villains cheering]  We get chocolate! <br/>We get chocolate! <br/>Probst: All right, good hard-fought battle once again in Heroes vs. Villains. Villains come up victorious. You're leaving from here. Grab your stuff, head out, enjoy the afternoon. <br/>Yes! <br/>Chocolate, baby! Oh, yeah! <br/>Probst: All right, Heroes, I got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. Except you, James. Stick around. We're gonna have Medical look at that. <br/>I hope for our sake that James come back to camp because we really need him. To lose one of our best competitors would be heartbreaking. heartbreaking. It'd be a tragedy. It'd be a tragedy. <br/>Him not being able to walk makes me worried straight away that he stretched  it quite significantly. Basically, we want to keep him in the game, but I'm afraid that he's done  severe enough damage to take him out. <br/>Probst: All right, you're gonna splint him up, and then see if he can walk on  it. That's the test. <br/>That's correct. <br/>That's correct. That's correct. That's correct. [all clamoring]  Oh, my God.]  I know. Where to start? [Jerri shrieks]  Congratulations, guys. We all got it, everybody. <br/>Good job. <br/>I need a plate. <br/>So proud of you guys. <br/>It's nice winning rewards. We got two good things happening at one time: we got rid of the big boy  James, maybe, and we got to eat chocolates. <br/>Oh, my God, I knew this was gonna happen. <br/>What? <br/>Chocolate headache. <br/>I have never eaten so much chocolate in one sitting in my entire life. Okay, I must agree, this is obscene. I'm, like, in a mix of chocolate euphoria and sickness. chocolate euphoria and sickness. [chuckles ruefully] [chuckles ruefully]  Whoo! [woman laughs]  Cool, huh? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Lookit, we're, like, under the ground right now. [Jerri laughs] So in the middle of the grounds, there's this huge hole in the  earth, and it's about 40 feet from the top to the bottom of this cave, and  it's full of cold saltwater that comes in right off the ocean. I mean, it's like something I'd never seen before. <br/>Who's left up there with  Who's left up there with Parvati? Parvati? <br/>We're gonna look real dumb if, like, he's out here playing if, like, he's out  here playing us all. us all. <br/>He got it right away. <br/>I guarantee it. <br/>When I played Survivor, there were no hidden immunity idols then. So this is all new to me. I'm just trying to adjust as I go along. But at the end of the day, we have to flush it out. The only way to do that is to vote for him. to vote for him. <br/>Look, things are changing...  Look, things are changing...  Look, things are changing...  What? <br/>What? [laughs] [laughs] Cheers. [laughs] Cheers. [laughs] Russell having the idol puts me in a better position in the game. Give me a little stronger footing because right now everyone's still trying  to vote me out. The all think I'm the biggest threat. For some reason, I'm like some evil mastermind who is gonna screw all of them  over, so they all want to vote me out now. So Russell having the idol is definitely like a good. He's a great ally for me. <br/>Just grab onto my coattails, girl. Yes, you do. <br/>I don't. <br/>You'll ride these. You gonna be okay. Nobody can know this, but somebody has to know with me so we can work it. I'm gonna show Coach. I'm gonna say...  He's scared. <br/>Yeah. Hit him blindside, and get rid of Rob. <br/>Yay! [laughs]  I'm gonna have to convince Coach to come to my side so we can get numbers  here. I have a powerful tool and that is the hidden immunity idol. I have the idol. And now we have the idol. So we get to the merge, we have to be to get to the merge. We can blindside whoever we want at anytime we want. And let me tell you something. on my life, that's the way I play to keep my numbers to get further in the  game. I don't have any problem to give it to you to get further in the game with  the votes. <br/>Wow! I mean, this is crazy. <br/>Dude, it took me three three days...  Whew! <br/>...and digging and digging and digging  I do want to play the game with Boston Rob, but for Russell to trust me with  that, is huge on his part because I'm the kind of person that if you give me  your loyalty, it's almost impossible for me to betray that trust. I feel like I need to do something monumental like Knights of the Roundtable. We go like this, and we put...  Can I do this? <br/>No, you do, you would, like, knight me just like that. I feel like this is... [Russell laughs] No, I'm serious. I feel like this is a monumental moment...  Dude, it is...  ...and I honor you for trusting me. <br/>I would never come to you and told you if I didn't trust you. Coach bows down to me. He was the one kneeling to me, and I knight him as the king that I am. I knight the dragon slayer to be part of my kingdom. The king and the dragon slayer. [both laugh]  Wow, man, that just blows my mind, dude. <br/>I have the dragon slayer on my side now. Then we'll weed out little Rob's group. It's personal with me and Rob. I don't think he knows who he's dealing with. He thinks he's tough? All right, may the best man win. All right, may the best man win. Let's do this. Let's do this. <br/>I'm just so frustrated, Candice, I really am. <br/>I'm very frustrated myself. <br/>I can't believe we, I can't believe what happened today. I really can't. If he gets taken out, this will be the second time he's been taken out for an  injury. <br/>I know. <br/>It's so sad. Uh! I'm just so frustrated, you know? It's a reward challenge for chocolate, and James gets hurt hurt again. And he could have a serious injury. Like, his knee, did you see it? It was like...  It's just a ligament, I think. <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah. James wants to be here so bad. And he looks out for me. [voice breaking]: I'm like his little sister. And so it's like, I don't know. It's just hard. I was trying to, like, make myself think, "Okay, if James doesn't come  back, what am I gonna do?" And I can't even think about it right now. I just hope that tonight I see him walk down that beach. I really do. <br/>I don't think James is coming coming back. <br/>Yes, James has been gone way too long. If he was coming back, they would have braced his knee, and they would have  sent him home. <br/>James and I have our differences, and, uh, I'm not rooting against a  teammate, but in the game of Survivor, somebody else being hobbled, in some  ways, is your advantage. <br/>I mean, that's it. Something that could affect him the rest of his life. the rest of his life. <br/>Heartbreaking. <br/>Heartbreaking. <br/>It's James. <br/>James is coming back? <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>And he's walking! <br/>And he's walking! <br/>I can't help it! <br/>I can't help it! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! You okay? <br/>Yeah, I'm all right. <br/>James is back, and I was so happy. [sobs]  Yay! [laughs] Oh,yay! <br/>Welcome back, big man. <br/>Yay. <br/>Ah, yay! <br/>So, yeah, what's the verdict? <br/>They don't know what's wrong with it. I don't know. <br/>Really? <br/>What do you mean, they don't know what's wrong with it? <br/>'Cause they don't know what's wrong with it. It's just not working. It felt good coming back in the camp. I mean, we'll see how things go. Hopefully, my alliance will stick together and keep me around till my knee  heals up. I have to work with what I got and make it happen. Make some lemonade out of this lemon knee. It's crazy 'cause it don't hurt. I'm just annoyed now, but...  It's not broken? <br/>No. <br/>It's not life-threatening. It's just not stable, right? <br/>Yeah. There's nothing wrong with it. Just, I just can't walk. <br/>And in order to get an MRI, what would you have to do, leave? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>I don't think that's gonna be too much of a problem. <br/>You just want to be left alone. <br/>Yes. Thank you. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>If we lose the next immunity challenge, there's no question in my mind that  James has got to go. There shouldn't be a question in anybody's mind. I mean, you can't lug around dead weight. And James is a lot of And James is a lot of dead weight. dead weight. dead weight. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! So, Coach, I'm guessing there was a lot of curiosity as to whether or not  James was still in the game. <br/>I'm glad, for one, that he's still in the game because you never want to see  a worthy competitor fall out like that. So I'm very happy to see him. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to your next immunity challenge? &gt; Yes. <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: First things first: Sandra, I know you don't want to give it up. [Sandra chuckles] Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, one person will be your caller. The other tribe members will be blindfolded and paired up. Using only verbal commands, the caller must direct their other tribe members to  collect ten very large puzzle pieces scattered in the field. Once you have all your pieces, take off your blindfolds, and the entire tribe  works together' to solve the puzzle. First tribe to get it right wins immunity, is safe once again from Tribal Council. Losers, voting somebody out. We have people on both tribes who played this challenge before. Colby and Rupert for the Heroes. For the Villains, Jerri, Boston Rob. Villains, you're sitting two people out. Cannot sit out the same people in back-to-back challenges. Who are the two that are sitting out this time? <br/>Me and Danielle. <br/>Probst: Tyson, Danielle, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize, minute to strategize,  we'll get started. we'll get started. All right, the caller for the Villain tribe is Jerri. Calling for the Heroes, James. James, I'm guessing that's because of the limited mobility. <br/>You could say that. <br/>Probst: Not a role we're used to seeing James in. Here we go for immunity. Survivors, ready? Go! <br/>Rob, you got a straight shot. <br/>All right, J.T., just walk straight. J.T., go straight. Tom to the left. <br/>Probst: J.T. bangs into a barrel. Colby and Tom bang into a barrel. A few obstacles on this course. <br/>Rupert, stop! Rupert, stop! Stop, Rupert! <br/>Stop, Coach! Reach right in front of you. That's a piece! <br/>Where are you, J.T.? <br/>Right here trying to pick this piece up. <br/>Okay, okay. <br/>Rob, that is the wrong piece! You want the one behind you. <br/>That's the wrong end. <br/>What do you need? <br/>Amanda, you beside me? Come here, Amanda. That's you? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Amanda now finds her right partner. J.T. and Amanda heading back with their first piece. Russell and Parvati have a piece for the Villains. Rob and Courtney have their first piece. <br/>Got it? <br/>Yep. <br/>BOTH: Oop, sorry. <br/>Rupert, step over to your right. There you go. <br/>James! <br/>No, Tom...  Probst: Colby and Tom now have another puzzle piece for the Heroes. Everybody heading back with puzzle pieces. Both callers doing a good job right off the bat. <br/>You're good, Rob. <br/>Well done. <br/>You dropped it. <br/>Probst: Both tribes have three pieces back. <br/>J.T., stop! No! <br/>Rob, the piece on your left is red. Rob, the piece on your right's... No, not that one! To your right. &gt; Not that way, not that way! J.T., no! J.T. behind you! <br/>James, this the right piece? James?! <br/>That's it. Rupert, you got it. <br/>Straight back to my voice. <br/>Ah! <br/>Okay, Russell, that is our piece. <br/>I don't want to trip. <br/>Probst: Two more pieces for the Villains. <br/>Probst: That's five. Heroes still at three. <br/>Head back out. All right, Rob, keep it...  Oh! <br/>Probst: Rupert and Candice back with another puzzle piece. Tom and Colby back with the Heroes' fifth piece. <br/>That's it. Stop, y'all. <br/>To your right, Rob. <br/>Probst: Rob and Courtney have another piece for the Villains. Villains now with six pieces. The Heroes with five. <br/>James! <br/>James! <br/>James! <br/>Stop! Everybody shut up and stop! To your left, J.T.! <br/>I got it. <br/>There you go. Rupert, back up one step. <br/>Stop! Walk straight! <br/>Back up. That's not a backup. Back up. <br/>Probst: Villains now with their seventh puzzle piece. J.T. and Amanda with the sixth piece for the Heroes. <br/>The right is open. Straight! <br/>Throw it over. Throw it over. <br/>Probst: Villains now with eight puzzle pieces. Tom and Colby with another piece for the Heroes, their seventh. <br/>Rob, keep going straight. Keep going straight. <br/>Probst: Rupert and Candice with the eighth piece for the Heroes. We are tied up! Each tribe has two puzzle pieces left. <br/>Tom, walk straight right there. [Rob groans]  Get it, Rob! Come towards me! Back up! Straight back! Straight back! <br/>Probst: These pieces are heavy. <br/>Walk straight, Tom. Walk straight! Rupert, to your right! Walk straight! Walk straight! <br/>Probst: James trying to get Rupert and Candice to find their last piece. <br/>Walk straight! Walk straight! Walk straight! <br/>Probst: Heroes now with nine pieces.

Walk it! <br/>Come on, Rupert! <br/>Bring it back! Bring it back! Y'all gotta move! Walk it back! Walk it back! <br/>Probst: Villains are now behind in this challenge. <br/>Walk it back! Walk, both of you! Walk it back! <br/>There's a piece right in front of you! That's our piece! <br/>Probst: Coach and Sandra have the last puzzle piece for the Villains. <br/>Got it! <br/>Probst: Rupert and Candice are back! Take off your blindfolds! Heroes now with a big lead on assembling this puzzle. <br/>We have the unlined one over here. This is the bottom with the sand. <br/>Come back to me! &gt; Oh, I'm tangled in the weeds. <br/>We're good. We're good. <br/>How about this right there? <br/>That's not right. That's not right. That's not right. <br/>Spin it around. <br/>No, that's not right. <br/>It's not right. <br/>Probst: Coach and Sandra moving as fast as they can with that final puzzle  piece for the Villains. <br/>Towards me! Towards me! <br/>Probst: Heroes taking advantage of that time that James gave 'em. <br/>James, I got it, man. <br/>This one goes...  Probst: Villains are back with their final piece! Blindfolds off! Start working on the puzzle! <br/>Good job, Russell. <br/>Probst: The Villains have had great success with challenges involving puzzles. <br/>How about this right there? <br/>No, no, no, no, no, it needs a tree, it needs a tree. Take if off. <br/>Come on, guys, move it! <br/>Move. <br/>Work together. <br/>J.T., is this over for that size? J.T., this one? <br/>This goes on the corner. <br/>That's the one I said went on the corner! <br/>Come on. Get it. Pick it up. <br/>Hey, guys, come on. Work as a team. <br/>Go over there. That corner. <br/>They told me "No."  Slide it to me. <br/>I see it. <br/>Probst: Villains making up a lot of time on their puzzle. <br/>That goes like that, Coach, 100%. <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: Heroes do not want to go back to Tribal Council. They are down two members in this game already. <br/>No, no. <br/>No! <br/>No! No, you guys, listen! <br/>I see it, I see it. <br/>Stop, stop, stop. <br/>Calm down. Calm down. <br/>Sorry, sorry. <br/>Probst: Now the Villains are very close. It's now the Heroes that are in trouble. <br/>No, no, no! I want... Coach is, Coach is there. <br/>That's right. <br/>Probst: Rob up on top calling the shots. <br/>Let's move it. <br/>Okay. <br/>Slide it in there. <br/>There it goes. <br/>Probst: Rob jumps down on the final piece! Villains win immunity! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Nobody going home, y'all. <br/>Probst: Villains, congratulations. Villains have now won four out of five immunity challenges. Well, another good effort by the Heroes, but the same result: another trip to  Tribal Council. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal tonight. Villains, enjoy the night off. Congratulations. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. <br/>I got 'em to where they need to go. We were in the lead. Me injured is already proven to be better than Tom. He really hasn't done anything in challenges but cause confusion at the  puzzle area. I mean, what's his excuses? He has good knees. He has good knees. He's still messed up. He's still messed up. <br/>All right, so it's been established that they can beat us in puzzles. I think that's fairly well established. <br/>We just can't pull it together on the puzzles. <br/>Or baskets, shooting. <br/>Or pretty much anything except sumo wrestling. <br/>Pretty much. <br/>God! <br/>Now the conniving starts. <br/>Now the conniving starts. <br/>Yep. <br/>Yep. <br/>What do you think? <br/>James. <br/>Is that consensus or do you think that? <br/>I think J.T. will go along  I think J.T. will go along with it, too. with it, too. <br/>We're not changing, are we? Tom? Good. <br/>Tom. Done. <br/>No matter, no matter what's wrong with James' leg. <br/>James' leg; he's still stronger than Tom. <br/>All right, good. <br/>Tom. <br/>Why? I feel like this is the dumbest move. He can't run! I mean, are we being stupid? <br/>I can't run. If that's the criteria, then you should have put me out. <br/>I feel like this is like a  I feel like this is like a really risky move. really risky move. <br/>Maybe. Let's just think about it hard. Decide together. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We got the afternoon to think about it. We need to think about it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>How you feeling, man? <br/>Dude, I'm good. <br/>I know you are. <br/>This is a big-ass distraction. Like someone that, you know...  You sure? <br/>Yeah, I just don't want to go. <br/>I know you're good. <br/>Cool deal. Y'all figure it out, but I Y'all figure it out, but I really don't want to go. really don't want to go. <br/>Logically, I should vote out James tonight. But if I were to try anything snakey again, I'm around Rupert, James and  Amanda. That would put myself in a, in a bad spot. <br/>Candice is pushing hard for James. If we're going totally on strength, Candice's butt is the weakest. We vote Candice's butt out. <br/>Yep. <br/>I still, I still say Tom, but I would, I would vote for Candice now, too. <br/>I say Tom first, then Candice. We're not getting rid of James. James is okay, right? <br/>No. I don't know. <br/>It's just more logical to do, to vote James out. <br/>That's the way the cookie crumbles, you know what I mean? James is the one that's injured. <br/>I know. We're in control right now, you and I because we can go either way. Tilt the thing either way. <br/>God, I hope J.T. votes good. <br/>J.T. cannot cross us. <br/>This is so stupid because J.T. didn't vote with us last Tribal Council, but I'm really depending on his vote  tonight. 'Cause if he doesn't vote with us, that means he's voting with Tom, Colby and  Candice against James. <br/>It makes perfect sense to get rid of James. I mean, there's no logic in voting to keep James and getting rid of you. You don't even have to plead your story. <br/>Mm-mm. <br/>I'm happy to hear that from both of you. <br/>In order for us to win, that's the best move for us to make. <br/>Yeah. I've got another noose around my neck, and, uh, until the votes come up and  you read your name four times, you're still alive in this game. I need J.T. and Candice to see the logic in sticking with Colby and I and eliminating  James tonight. I'm pretty sure Candice is with us. And I'm hoping that J.T. sees the light. the light. <br/>J.T.... <br/>J.T.... <br/>I was thinking your way. <br/>I would hope so. <br/>I'm voting the same as you do then. <br/>Which do we want,  Which do we want, Tom or Candice? Tom or Candice? Okay? <br/>All right  You and me. <br/>You and me. <br/>I'm with you. <br/>I'm with you. <br/>Okay. <br/>Um, J.T.'s the one. He's the swing. I'm sure he's with us. <br/>Where's J., where's J.T. on all this? <br/>J.T. says that he's with us. <br/>Yep. <br/>J.T. looked me in the eye and swore he's writing Tom's name down. <br/>What's the word? <br/>I guess we get rid of James. It should be James. <br/>I think tonight James should be the one. <br/>Makes all the logical sense to get rid of James. <br/>We're going to another Tribal Council and most everybody's looking to J.T. for a vote. And the reason for that is because J. T. is so wishy-washy. J.T. flip-flops at every opportunity that he has, you know, because he's clearly  just playing the hand that suits him today. <br/>I swear. <br/>I don't know what he's telling everybody else, but if he's making deals with  everyone in this posse, I can guarantee in this posse, I can guarantee that  will come back to bite him. that will come back to bite him. <br/>Probst: Let's start by going back to the reward challenge. James, what happened? <br/>I don't know really what happened. I popped it, and I thought I was okay, and I tried to stand up. And it doesn't hurt. It just, right now it's not listening. <br/>Probst: Rupert, this is an unusual situation; to have somebody that's still  in the game, but they're immobilized. My niece could beat James in a race right now. <br/>No, she couldn't. <br/>Probst: I watched you walking today. <br/>With this brace, yes, it's a little bit harder. But you couldn't beat me in a race, man. [Probst chuckles] Real talk. <br/>James still has some strength in there, you know. I want to believe that James is gonna be okay. <br/>Probst: J.T., you can certainly understand why if you're James, you want to  put your best foot forward and say, "Don't get rid of me 'cause of  this."  Yeah, man, I understand exactly what he's saying. I mean there's no way I would ever say vote me out due to an injury. I don't care if I had a cast and my leg was broke. <br/>Probst: What's the level of concern, though his spirit may be there,  physically may not be able to perform like he needs to be able to? <br/>That's a huge concern. I mean, a very high level of concern. I mean, we gotta win. Our back's against the wall. We cannot lose anymore. <br/>Probst: James, what do you think happened today? You got 'em there ahead of the other group. What happened during the puzzle? We started off all right in the beginning, and after that, everybody just  went haywire and did their own thing. Over here it just, everybody went willy-nilly and tried to solve the puzzle  on each side. <br/>Probst: You keep looking this way. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Who you looking at? <br/>Them two. <br/>Probst: Tom and? <br/>Candice. <br/>No, he's mad because we're thinking about whether it makes sense to keep him  with the bum knee or not, and that's what he's talking about. <br/>Baby, you just hustling for your next thing. I'm tired of arguing with y'all. I'm honestly over both of y'all. It's whatever. <br/>Jeff, all this pretense about whether or not it's his physical condition, and  Rupert saying, "Well, we think that he's gonna be okay," it's all nonsense. He's not being kept for any physical ability. He's being kept because he's a loyal vote. <br/>Well, it looks like Tom's pointing the blame, but also...  That's the, that's the, that's the main thing. There's blame on us. <br/>...he tried to vote me out. And I don't think I'm a weak player in this game, so it's vice versa. <br/>Probst: So, Tom, fingers being pointed at you as one of the people who won't  shut up and just do. <br/>I don't see that. Not during the challenges. I don't think it plays out that way. Um, when he talks about shutting up and doing what you're told, that's his  voting strategy. Somebody tells him, "Shut up. "Just vote the way I'm telling you." It's not his game strategy. If he's quiet during the challenge, it's probably because he doesn't know  what's going on. <br/>Probst: J.T., is that a fair comment? James saying, "Tom just needs "to shut up. It's causing us to lose."  I wouldn't say that it's causing us to lose, no. I don't think it's right to point the blame at nobody for us losing 'cause  none of can win. <br/>Probst: Tom, last Tribal Council you played the hidden immunity idol. Clearly you felt you were in trouble, and you were. You got votes. Concerned again that it's you? <br/>Absolutely. Yeah, it's me tonight unless a couple of good people vote for the team and  for our strength and for our unity, and not for the numbers. You know if somebody here thinks that James with a busted knee is gonna do  more in the competitions than I am, I don't think they're being sincere. I think they're just voting and keeping their numbers together. <br/>If y'all really think that guy can outperform me, vote for me. Put me out. I want y'all to win. And if y'all really think y'all could win with him, ball, go ahead. go ahead. But we still gonna be cool. But we still gonna be cool. <br/>Probst: Well, James laid it out pretty clearly. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Colby, you're up. Colby, you're up. Colby, you're up. <br/>James-- all mass, no class. <br/>James-- all mass, no class. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote: Tom. First vote: Tom. First vote: Tom. Tom. Two votes Tom. Tom. Two votes Tom. Tom. Two votes Tom. James. James. James. That's two votes Tom, That's two votes Tom, two votes James. two votes James. Tom. That's three votes Tom, Tom. That's three votes Tom, two votes James. two votes James. The fifth person voted out of Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains:Tom. That's four. It's enough. You need to bring me your torch. your torch. <br/>Be safe out there, guys. <br/>Be safe out there, guys. <br/>Probst: Tom, the tribe has spoken. has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. Well, it's clear with tonight's vote that even with a bad leg, James is still  more valuable to this tribe than Tom. That decision will certainly be put to the test very soon. Grab your torches, head back to camp. back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Gather around. Gather around. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:  It's Russell. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob becomes Russell's judge, jury and executioner. <br/>He's not playing with the amateurs anymore. <br/>Probst: But Russell has other ideas. <br/>I don't care how strong he is, I don't care who he is. He's threatening Russell Hantz. When you do that, you go. <br/>Watch your back, man. <br/>Watch your back, man. <br/>Same thing for you, man. <br/>Same thing for you, man. <br/>Bitterly disappointed to be here and not still in the game. Wish I was fighting it out to the bitter end with these people, but I got on  the wrong side of the numbers early, and just in spite of my best intentions,  just couldn't get that turned around. I don't think that James is up to snuff, and I hope they're that gonna be  thinking, "Geez, we could have used Tom." But good luck to  everybody in But good luck to everybody in it, and glad to have been here.
