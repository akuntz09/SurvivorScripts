<br/>Jeff Probst: By the end of tonight, one of these five will win the title of  sole survivor and the million dollars that comes with it. There's only one thing standing in the way of the Foa Foa foursome making it  all the way to the final four, and his name is Brett. But out of all the castaways that started this journey, how did it come down  to these five? Russell had a strategy from the very beginning. <br/>I think if I can control how they feel, I can control how they think. <br/>Probst: Because of Russell, the Foa Foa tribe turned on each other. <br/>Somebody drank my whole canteen. <br/>There's no more water. <br/>We gotta fill the canteens. <br/>Would you just relax? <br/>Use a little common sense. <br/>Probst: The turmoil allowed Russell to manipulate his tribe...  She's going first. <br/>Probst: ...and take out anyone he wanted. <br/>They my little puppets. When I'm finished with them, I just throw them in the trash. <br/>Probst: Galu wins immunity! But it also might have contributed to Foa Foa's spectacular failure at  challenges; they lost almost every one. <br/>We do have a pox or a hex or some kind of curse on Foa Foa. <br/>Probst: But as their numbers rapidly dwindled, a tight-knit group of four  emerged. Natalie, the quote, unquote nice girl. Most people didn't think she would last a day, let alone a a month. <br/>She came into this game the Southern belle. I think she's changed a lot. <br/>Probst: Jaison, the social conscience of the tribe, a Fulbright scholar who  stands up for what he believes in. <br/>If what you're telling me is that what you said had absolutely no racial  context, then maybe you are ignorant. <br/>Probst: Mick, who was initially selected as tribe leader but couldn't rally  them to victory. Mick with a great shot. Mick is the new mark to beat. However, lately he has proved that he can win individual challenges. Mick safe at tonight's Tribal Council. This diverse group has one thing in common; they all take their cues from  Russell. <br/>He is the most powerful player in this game. (thunder crashing)  Probst: While the Foa Foa tribe struggled, the Galu tribe...  Whoo! <br/>Probst: sat back and laughed. (all laughing)  They are in trouble. After I'm finish this, I'll take the whole team by myself. <br/>Russell get off the table. <br/>Probst: But when they lost their charismatic leader... Medical! to a medical emergency...  Lie him down. <br/>Probst: ...they lost the glue that held them together. Unfortunately for them, they didn't realize it. Galu entered the merge with a staggering 8-to-4 advantage... (cheers and  applause)  Probst: ...confident they would devour the opposition. <br/>Unless something goes wrong, Foa Foa doesn't matter, simple as that. <br/>Probst: But Natalie shocked everyone by making the first counterattack. <br/>(whispers) I don't trust Erik. <br/>Probst: She convinced the old Galu to take out one of their strongest players. Time for you to go. Then it was Russell's turn to make a move. He scoured the camp and found a hidden immunity idol...  That easy. <br/>Probst: ...and played it to take out another Galu. Kelly, the tribe has spoken. He also turned a disgruntled Shambo against her tribe...  I trust Russell implicitly more than anybody in this game. <br/>Probst: ...which provided the old Foa Foa with the numbers to take out four  more of the old Galu in a row. <br/>Stupid, stupid little girl. Bad strategy. <br/>Probst: By day 35, the Foa Foa turnaround was almost complete. <br/>It is done. They say don't get confident in this game. You know what? I'm confident as hell. <br/>Probst: But while Russell was congratulating himself on his clean sweep of  the old Galu, Brett, who had been virtually unheard of during the entire  game, came out of nowhere to win challenges... Brett wins individual immunity! ...and keep the memory of Galu's past glories alive. Once again, Brett is safe at Tribal Council, guaranteed a spot in the final  five. <br/>I worked too damn hard for some kid to come here and start working, and day  33-- you know, what strategy did he do that worked for him? Absolutely nothing. <br/>Probst: In order to beat Brett, the Foa Foa four decided they needed the  youngest and strongest players to stay in the game, so they were forced to  vote off Shambo. With Brett's former tribe making up the entire jury and Russell looming as a  threat to his own allies, the real battle starts now. * * *  We have tree mail. Already. <br/>We don't have to get up. <br/>I'll read to y'all in bed. "37 days you've survived this "game, a victory guarantees "one  more. "Use balance, speed and "patience to fight to the final four."   Uh-oh. I have so little energy and diarrhea all night. I was, like, "Just don't let me get killed."  Everybody here is sleeping, napping, complaining and bitching, you know, I  came here focused. I came here knowing I was going to suffer. But you know what? Get over it. Get up and do something. Get ready for this challenge. We have to get rid of Brett. It's a shame that I'm set up with these bunch of misfits because I should be  here with superstars. <br/>I'm just ready to get out of here more than anything else. My stomach hurts. Just try to get through two days and go home. <br/>Two more nights, man, that's it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Two more nights here. <br/>As far as I'm concerned, everything's cool. So I'm not second-guessing what we got going on. If you know what I mean. <br/>Yeah. I think Russell will have a hard time voting her off. <br/>I think Russell will have an easier time doing a lot of things than you think. None of us really have a chance as long as Brett's here, so we got to keep  going after him. <br/>Hopefully, one of us will pull this thing off. <br/>I agree. Brett shouldn't be here right now. You know, this guy has got some skills. I think he can make a run. And now this guy is going on an immunity run like we've never seen. (thunder rumbling)  Look what's happening now. <br/>I was worried. <br/>You know what's gonna happen if he wins the next one? I ain't gonna be there to save you. How? <br/>But how would I be next, though? Why would I be next? <br/>Because the three guys state to beat him on the last challenge. <br/>Okay. So we got to just...  Well, that sucks. <br/>Well, we just got to win. He's not some freakin' athlete genius. <br/>Well, I would love to go to the final three and...  Yeah, I know. We just have... I don't know what's gonna happen. We could possibly beat him, and then it's back to the normal plan. <br/>If not, though, you think I'm going? <br/>Probably so. <br/>You know, my whole goal coming into this game was to play the underdog, be  underestimated and just kind of slide through, which is what I've done, and  it's gotten me this far. <br/>We all know what has to happen. Sometimes you got to go for it. That's what I'm gonna do. <br/>You know, Russell and I had always planned to be in the top, but  unfortunately, they want to beat Brett so bad at the next immunity challenge  that, you know, there's honestly, probably no way that I could beat Brett. <br/>We just got to win this one. <br/>Yeah. <br/>If we don't beat him, we don't have a shot. I'm talking about, you know, the dog in the corner. It looks like we've got four of them in the corner now. You know, Brett's won two individual immunities. He could possibly win the last two, but what's two immunities? If Jaison could win two in a row, anybody can win two in a row. That means absolutely nothing to me. Let's see if a 21-year-old can outdo me when it comes to pain. So you're telling me he's all of a sudden superman 'cause he wins two? He, he's not some superstar to me. You start thinking that, you start getting weak in the mind, thinking you  can't beat him, like you're stepping into the ring with Mike Tyson. He's no Mike Tyson. He's Brett. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Final five: Natalie, Russell, Brett, wearing immunity... Mick and Jaison. Russell, as we go into this challenge, is it still the Foa Foa four against  the one remaining guy in purple? <br/>Yes, it is. That's what it is. <br/>Probst: Brett, does that energize you or make you feel like you've got to  watch your back everywhere? <br/>This is an individual competition, so it's definitely a motivator to know  that I have four people with the sole goal of just beating me, so, yeah, it's  definitely a motivator for me. <br/>Probst: Well, you've had it two times in a row around your neck. Let's see if you can do it a third time. I will take it back, Brett... ...because once again, immunity is back up for  grabs. For today's challenge, you will race across a series of obstacles, grab a bag  of puzzle pieces, and race back. You must then climb a very steep wall to a platform and use those pieces to  solve a puzzle. First person to get it right wins immunity and is guaranteed a one-in-four  shot at winning a million bucks. We know what's up; four Foa Foa taking on one former Galu. Shall we get to it? <br/>Yes. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Probst: We'll draw for spots, we'll get started. Here we go for immunity and a guaranteed spot in the final four. Survivors ready? Go! Jaison takes a hard fall in the net run. Mick falls off. Got to get back up on. Natalie's across. Jaison is across. Brett is across. And Mick is across. Russell heading back. Jaison's heading back. Everybody heading back. Russell cruising across the balance beam. Russell scales that wall. Jaison right behind. Brett's still in it. Everybody climbing up the wall. Everybody is in this challenge. Russell has his pieces open first. Mick right behind. Brett now has his pieces untied. Five people vying for a shot at the final four. That much closer to a million bucks. The stakes are very clear for Brett. He has four people working to beat him. Brett making quick work of his puzzle. Mick now getting in on it. His puzzle starting to come together. Russell starting to come together. Natalie starting to come together. Everybody needs to keep moving. Somebody going home tonight. Jaison, nowhere close at this point. 37 days is a long time to lose now. Russell getting a little closer. Mick getting closer. Right now it is Brett, Russell, and Mick. You need to keep moving. This challenge is going to end soon. Russell trying to pick up the pace. Brett very close. Brett with only a couple of pieces left. Russell trying to scramble. Mick hustling to finish. Brett has it! Brett wins immunity! <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Probst: Brett, come on over. For the third time in a row, Brett wins individual immunity. Odds clearly stacked against you, you continue to defy them. Brett is safe at tonight's Tribal Council. One of the original Foa Foa four going home after 37 days. I don't envy this afternoon. It's going to be an interesting one. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. Congrats. <br/>Thanks. If I didn't win immunity I know I was going home. I've been trying for some time to get the Foa Foa tribe on the jury, and  tonight, at Tribal will be the first time that that's happened. To finally see a Foa Foa member go home will be relieving. <br/>It is absolutely the worst feeling to have to go to Tribal Council tonight. All four of us Foa Foa have been so tight, loyal, and trustworthy to this  point. We have no other Galu to pick off. I mean, Brett won immunity. There is no other option. A Foa Foa has to go home and I definitely feel like my head's on the chopping  block, clearly, because I'm the weakest one. I'm just... I'm hanging by a thread. So what's the plan? I'm sure they want me. <br/>Yeah... I'm gonna change it. <br/>Promise me? <br/>Yeah, I promise you. <br/>I've trusted you only from the first day, so...  If it was you, I'd tell you right now. <br/>I know. Just like I told you earlier, it might be. <br/>I'm trying to keep Natalie because she's holding on my coattails. Who better to take to the final two than her? There's no way she can beat me in votes? 'Cause the next challenge, I think I'll take the next one. He's a kid, so he's going to give it all he's got, but you know what? All backs are up against the wall now. <br/>This is the hard part, sitting here waiting for Tribal Council. Just going to go through the motions and do what we can do tonight. And move on to tomorrow. <br/>Yup. You guys know what you're doing or up in the air? <br/>You know, you always think you know what you're doing but you never actually  know what's going to happen, you know. <br/>Yup. <br/>So...  Oh! <br/>What's going on, man? <br/>I'm tired. <br/>A couple of days left. <br/>Jaison checked out of this game a long time ago, and the weakest link right  now is Jaison, even over Natalie. She's stronger than him. So the question is now Mick or Jaison? It's a good thing about keeping Jaison is he can't beat me in the votes. The bad thing about keeping Jaison is he can't beat Brett in the challenge. The good thing about keeping Mick is he can possibly beat Brett in the  challenge. The bad thing about keeping Mick is Mick might beat me in jury votes. One of us is going home. <br/>Yeah, well, I mean, yeah--  The only way me and you can stay in the final three is to keep Natalie. We're gonna have to get rid of of Mick. <br/>I agree. We'll get rid of Mick and then take another shot at Brett. <br/>Right. <br/>Yeah. Russell and I have a very long history of working together. From, I think, day two we decided we were going to have an alliance and go to  the finals together and I think it's just grown exponentially over the last  37 days and I think Russell and I trust each other enough that we are  comfortable. When I say this, I mean it. When he says that, he means it. And so I really do think it will be myself and Russell and somebody else in  the finals on day 39. <br/>This is how it's going to go. I mean, it's going to be Jaison leaves tonight. That gives us a shot to beat Brett. We cannot beat him for the million dollars. Jaison can't beat him in anything. <br/>The plan is that it be Jaison tonight. I wish he could stay around, but Natalie's head's much more in the game than  Jaison's. He shows up, but he's not really into it at all. <br/>If you agree with me on that, we're cool. <br/>I agree with you on that. <br/>We'll go to the final three. I promise you, we're going to the final three. <br/>All right. I like it. Russell and I had a pact from the very beginning that it would be us in the  final three. And the fact that that's actually on the horizon is a little shocking. <br/>All right. <br/>Okay, done. <br/>I'm going to go look this way. You know, I told Mick to vote Jaison, Jaison to vote Mick. So you know, It's up to me and Natalie if Mick goes home or if Jaison goes  home. We're the ones making the decision. Well, let's discuss Mick or Jaison. <br/>There are pros and cons to both. <br/>So why do you think Jaison should go tonight? <br/>He hasn't been feeling well the last couple of days. He's had nothing to drink. <br/>Why should we vote off Mick? <br/>Voting off Mick would ensure that he'd be gone tonight, then tomorrow if we  win immunity, then it's just me, you, and Jaison in the top three and we have  a better chance. <br/>I could keep Mick. I could keep Jaison. They both have goods and bads. So now I'm weighing it. What in the world am I supposed to do? <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Erik. Kelly. Laura. John. Dave. Monica. And Shambo, voted out at the last Tribal Council. All right, well, after seven straight Tribal Councils in which former Galu  members were voted out, finally, it comes down to this-- one of the former  Foa Foa members is going home tonight. Jaison, when did the reality really hit you that there was nowhere to hide? <br/>Probably when I heard "Brett wins immunity." I mean, who thought he  was going to win three in a row? You know, I came into this challenge figuring it had to be one of our times  to take that necklace back to move forward with the four of us. But clearly, that didn't happen. <br/>Probst: So, Natalie, it seems like there would be two very different  approaches to tonight's vote. <br/>Absolutely. I mean, if we don't beat Brett, clearly, he's going to get every single vote  on the jury. So do we keep the strongest people that could possibly beat Brett? The other thought is, do I keep someone that I think I can beat in front of  the jury? <br/>Probst: Jaison, I'm guessing the real dilemma is if I keep the right people  and we beat Brett, but I keep the wrong people because I can't beat the guys  I kept. <br/>Yeah. And I think it's especially difficult because there are two or three people  up here who could command a lot of the jury votes, so maybe it is better just  to try and take out the next strongest competitor for the jury, and see if we  can get lucky and get Brett next time. <br/>Probst: Mick, who would have guessed with only five people left there would  be so many different layers of decision making happening? <br/>My mindset has been Brett in front of the jury equals a million bucks. So it makes sense to keep people that can beat him at this last immunity. <br/>Probst: Your argument is all hands on deck, got to take out Brett. <br/>Right. <br/>Probst: Jaison says all hands on deck could ultimately backfire because I  still want to win. Why would that make sense? <br/>You're putting a lot more pressure on yourself in saying I think I can beat  Brett. And so far, it just hasn't happened, man. None of these old guys up here has been able to take the kid out. <br/>Probst: Brett, up until now, have you been sandbagging it waiting to turn on  the afterburners? <br/>I think the past few challenges have just coincided with certain skills that  I have and having really nothing to lose is a different frame of mind that I  have that these people don't necessarily have. <br/>Probst: Brett, what was it like for you at camp today? You got nothing to worry about. These four had to be scrambling. <br/>Yeah, but I think I'd rather have the stress that they have. I mean, you can't bank on winning immunity challenges forever to stay in this  game. Most of the time, you kind of need that social component so when you don't  win, you know, someone has your back and they can take you to end. <br/>Probst: Russell, a little surprised that Brett would actually prefer to be  where you guys are now? <br/>Yeah, because how hard is it to beat Foa Foa, really, you know? We won one immunity challenge. He wins three in a row... (laughter) You know, we're still getting beat by  Galu, but only one of them is here. <br/>Probst: Jaison, would you gladly switch with Brett and take the necklace  tonight? <br/>Yeah. Who wouldn't want the odds that he has right now. He just has to win one more challenge, and there might be two of us in the  finals, but if he got there, he'd definitely have the upper hand. <br/>Probst: The reason I'm bringing it up is we're at the point in the game where  how you play the game is going to impact the jury. Brett, it's one thing to get to the end. It's another to have earned the spot in the end. <br/>Yeah, I've won three challenges in a row which is great, but it don't mean  anything unless I can win the next one. So you got to stay humble in this game and not feel too strong in my own  abilities to potentially screw that up. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. Brett, I got to tell you, when Tribal Council started, I wasn't even going to  bother asking, but in light of your comments, is there somebody you want to  give that necklace to so you can switch spots? <br/>No, I'm going to keep it. <br/>Probst: All right, you cannot vote for Brett. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. Mick, you're up. <br/>This sucks. I hate doing this, but I kind of feel like you checked out a long time ago. So...  Sorry, buddy, this was a tough one. <br/>I hate that I have to do this, but I got to keep to my strategic play, and  this is the best move for me to win the game. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Mick. Jaison. One vote Mick, one vote Jaison. Jaison. Two votes Jaison, one vote Mick. 14th person voted out and the eighth member of our jury, Jaison. There's three. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Jaison, the tribe has spoken. Congratulations on making it to the final four. Tomorrow you will compete in your final immunity challenge. Try to get a good night's sleep. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>I'm kind of pissed off at Russell for blindsiding me. For a relationship that you had since day two you at least let the guy know  he's going home. So I don't think I'd be cheering for Russell in this one. I would root for Brett. Brett is the underdog. He is who we were. We came from nothing to be something and he did pretty much the same thing on  his own to win three straight, maybe four straight. <br/>Final four. <br/>Thank you, Lord. <br/>So few torches. It's weird. <br/>Yes. <br/>It's definitely a miracle for me to still be here as day 37 ends, and there  are three Foa Foas in the final four. <br/>Yes. Congratulations. <br/>Good work, bro. <br/>Final four. <br/>Final four. <br/>Final Foa. <br/>This is something I didn't really imagine. As I look towards the next Tribal Council, you know, I really feel like my  fate is in my own hands. As of right now, the only thing I'm banking on is really winning another  immunity challenge because if I don't win I'm probably going to be the next  person to go home. <br/>Me and you is in the top three. Do you think you can beat me? <br/>What? <br/>If you win the last immunity idol, me and you is in the top three, do you  think you can beat me? <br/>I don't know. <br/>Do you think it would be a shot? <br/>It would be a... I think it would be pretty close. <br/>Brett won immunity. That means he could possibly win four immunity challenges in a row. That's a humungous threat. Of the people that's here, if I went to the final three, and I got to choose,  dude, I'm here who deserves it more. Trust me. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm here to win the game. They should have three at the top that deserve it the most. <br/>I'd rather go up against someone that's harder to beat and lose than to,  like, put myself in a position where I go up against people that are easier  to beat and win. <br/>What I can promise you is me and you will be in the top three. Have a seat, man. <br/>Yeah. <br/>So if you win it, then you're safe, of course. If I win it I'll take you to top three. If we win top three, we have no doubts. I'm going to do it straight up with you. Deal. <br/>Deal. <br/>Top three. <br/>Legitimate. <br/>I'm real on this. <br/>I'm real, too. <br/>Okay. <br/>This is a big one. <br/>You got to have some kind of insurance policy in this game. If he keeps winning, I got to save myself. Number one, uno, here. I take care of me. I don't take care of nobody else this game. So I'm sitting pretty right now. I have a one-two spot with every single person out here right now, Natalie,  Brett, and Mick. It looks like I'm going to be in the top three no matter what. <br/>Ooh, it's a big one. <br/>If I win this challenge today, I'm 100% positive that the game is mine. I won the million dollars. You know, it's a very interesting situation to be in, but I love it. This is how I want it to be. <br/>Tree mail! Got a little note for you all. All right. "Congratulations, final four. You are almost at the end of the line. Follow the map to the cliffs on the coast. There you will find the torches of your fallen comrades. At each torch, you will collect a representative mask of those who were voted  out before you. At the end of your journey, you will burn them, paying your respects as they  each had a part in getting you to this point. You will then proceed to your final immunity challenge." Each person  that has been voted out has played some role in how I got where I am right  now. I mean, you know, every Tribal Council I look at the jury, and I see all the  people that I trusted, and so, you know, I'm really fighting for them. I'm fighting for the Galu tribe that flourished in the first half of this  game and floundered in the second half. So it's definitely the motivation for me to keep pushing, to keep fighting,  and let the purple win. <br/>Marisa. <br/>Marisa! <br/>Marisa! <br/>I really believe if I wouldn't have got rid of her first, I wouldn't be here  today. <br/>The men in my tribe really came gunning for me. They were really scared of having any strong women on their tribe and I was  the strongest woman on our tribe, period. And so I learned a great deal about myself. Being a strong woman is way more important than getting any kind of  validation from a man. <br/>Mike Borassi. <br/>Wow. <br/>This is one of the most headstrong competitors I think on Foa Foa. He wasn't going to hear "no."  You know, he didn't even get to play the game. That's what sad about that. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I underestimated the conditions and how severe it can get. It's a thousand times harder than I thought it would be. But I not only held my own. I made them respect me, and that's the whole thing. You never give up, and you go down swinging. <br/>Oh, Betsy. <br/>The only thing that I didn't like is she told me was, "Russell, you're  playing this game too hard." You know what? If you only play it 50%, even starting at day one, this is where you end up. <br/>I think being here rekindled the desire to push myself to the limits that I  lost before I had kids. So now I tapped into that, and I feel like a breath of fresh air. <br/>Ben. <br/>Oh, Ben. <br/>I think he had no idea how to play it socially. <br/>Right. <br/>None. <br/>I wasn't sorry to see him go. <br/>I think I'm a little misinterpreted. I was very brutally honest with everybody. People can't handle that. They don't want to hear about themselves. They don't want to hear the truth because the truth hurts. I'm truthful with myself. I know myself. And if the survival aspect of this game was just survival, I would kill all  these people. Our girl, Yas! <br/>Yasmin! <br/>That girl is just such a-- such a character, such a crack-up. <br/>At the end of the day, the girl from the 'hood did do pretty good. I learned to keep trusting myself. That is something I will continue to do and I also learned one other thing, I  won't be going camping. (laughing)  Ashley. <br/>She was my little sister. I loved her. <br/>My strategy was to make a really strong alliance, and it didn't work. I got played. Russell made an alliance with every single person, and he's a snake. And he called the shots. If he wanted you out, you were out. <br/>Big Russ, the heart and soul to the Galu tribe. You guys don't know. This is the man that propelled us to so many victories. <br/>Tenacious. That guy was tenacious in challenges. I mean, we hated to see him go, but stoked to see him go as well. <br/>Being taken out of the game for medical reasons is the most demoralizing  thing I've ever felt. I believe a man is supposed to provide for his family. I was going to win that million dollars. But for my wife and my daughter, knowing that they're there waiting on me to  come home, if it wasn't for them, I would have rather died that day. <br/>Liz. <br/>She was physical. Let me tell you. <br/>She was. <br/>She was a rock star, for sure. <br/>I would never have characterized myself as somebody who was patient before. And now I have known the depths of patience. You know, when you go without food and you go without a lot of the creature  comforts that you're used to, you have nothing but patience. <br/>Erik. All the big moves we made in this game, Foa Foa, Galu made the first big move  for us. <br/>Fierce competitor. <br/>Fierce, fierce competitor. <br/>He was. <br/>Almost psycho? (all laugh)  I experienced betrayal, but the most perfect thing happened; I was betrayed  so that I could leave indicators for that betrayal. Voting me out was the downfall of Galu. And so I am completely content with how things ended up. <br/>Oh, Kelly! <br/>Kel dawg, my homegirl. <br/>The funny thing is, in this game, I feel like the men are always terrified of  the women, which totally makes sense now, so I got sent home. Definitely had a lot of fight left in me for the game. I could have done it. <br/>Little Laura. <br/>Such a strong competitor. <br/>I was clearly, like, one of the oldest people that was out there. You know what? You still can't beat me. I mean, even at my age, even being a grandma, I'm totally re-stereotyping the  grandma. You can't beat this grandma. <br/>There's John. He tried to make a move with me, along with me and Shambo. For some reason, he thought I was telling him the truth. <br/>Being part of a highly effective team is something that I'm used to. But your ability to connect with idiots who can't process things properly is  a large part of what this comes down to. It's like you only have so much control over the way people do things. But I don't think I had a better move than what I did. <br/>Danger Dave Ball. <br/>Danger Dave. <br/>Danger Dave Ball. <br/>What a man. <br/>Hilarious. <br/>I'm not really the easiest person to grasp. I'm not the easiest person to get along with. I can be a jerk... but I can also be fairly warm and compassionate. I would like to be, you know, appreciated and accepted for who I am, but I've  kind of learned to be okay with being misunderstood. <br/>Monica! <br/>You know, I got to be honest with you guys, I think Monica was the fakest  person here. <br/>Well...  I think she wanted to go out...  ...with a bang. <br/>a fight. <br/>With a bang, yeah. <br/>And that girl is a firecracker. <br/>She was a firecracker. <br/>I give that girl much credit. <br/>You gear up for these challenges. I mean, I look around me and I see a lot of these really well[1]apt  competitors and that fear of failure is so dark and it's scary. And then you come to a point where you're, like, "You know what? "I'm gonna do this for myself, "and I'm gonna put it all out  there." And that is in itself is winning a million dollars. <br/>Shambo! <br/>Shambo! <br/>You guys give this girl much prop. <br/>Definitely. <br/>Without her you guys would not be standing here. <br/>We would not be here if it weren't for Shambo. <br/>That is for darn sure. <br/>I was alienated, shunned, disrespected, and the funny thing is, in my entire  life, I have been the uplifter of the the underdog. So to be the one that was the victim was just a bizarre eye-opening  experience. It doesn't hurt my self-esteem. It makes me incredibly proud and happy that God made me the person that I am. Lift people up... don't tear 'em down. <br/>The last fallen survivor...  ALL: Jaison. <br/>Jaison-- a great competitor, super smart guy. I mean the guy is, uh... we'll be voting for senator for him before we know  it, I think. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>I was having a really, really, really, really, really difficult time. But I am really proud of myself for not quitting, and so I think that I take  away from this a new confidence in myself to be able to get through  difficult, hard times because I've been so miserable. (groans)  An ode to our fallen survivors. <br/>We pay our respects. We wouldn't be here without you. *  Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to your final immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>I guess so. <br/>Probst: I'll take it back once again, Brett. For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs. Today's challenge will require balance and concentration. Here's how it works: on my "go," you will each place a wooden  statue on the end of a pole. At regular intervals, you'll add another section of pole, making it more  difficult to keep stable. The statue falls off, you're out of the challenge. Last person left standing wins immunity and is guaranteed a spot at the final  Tribal Council where you will get a chance to plead your case in front of the  jury for a million dollars. Very simple. Shall we get to it? <br/>Yes. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Probst: Take your spots. We'll get started. All right, everybody take your statue, place it on your first section of pole. Make sure you like where it's at, and then you'll have to take your hand off  the statue, and we'll be started. All right, five, four, three, two, one. This challenge is on. (Russell exhales sharply) All right, you have 30 seconds to add another  section of pole starting now. You got to reach for that section of pole, get it in the slot, get your hands  back down on that lowest section. That little white marker, that's your boundary. You don't want to go above that. If your statue falls off, you're out of the challenge. We will keep adding another section of pole every two minutes until only one  player is left. * Don't panic. Don't rush. You have plenty of time. Mick is the first one out of the challenge. Natalie's now out of the challenge. We're down to two. Russell and Brett. Each of you are now holding six feet. One former Foa Foa, one former Galu. There are no secrets out here. Brett needs to win to move to that final Tribal Council. Russell would love to take him out and go to final Tribal with Mick and  Natalie and have a shot at winning. This is quite possibly the million-dollar challenge. The wind's starting to pick up a little bit now. Affecting both guys. Good recovery. Here we go. It is time to add another section of pole. This will put you at seven feet. This is when it gets really tricky. Take your time. You have 30 seconds to make the transition. It starts now. Brett quickly goes for his. Russell waiting. Got ten seconds left. Five, four, three, two, one. Another successful transition. You're now at seven feet. Brett starting to wobble. Nice recovery. This is a showdown. Russell starting to wobble. Brett falls off. Russell wins individual immunity, his first and it couldn't have come at a  better time. <br/>Good job, Brett. <br/>Probst: Russell, come on over. <br/>This is the time I wanted it. <br/>Probst: Russell wins the final individual immunity challenge. You're going to the final Tribal Council. You will get a chance to plead your case in front of the jury as to why you  deserve a million dollars. Natalie, Mick, Brett, one of you going home tonight. Your shot at a million dollars will come to an end. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you at Tribal tonight. <br/>I won immunity today. This is worth a million dollars right now. In my opinion, I just won the game. <br/>Great job. It was awesome. Phenomenal, Russ. <br/>Finally got it around your neck, my friend. <br/>Finally got it. Congrats, man. <br/>So final immunity challenge, it was our last-ditch effort to beat Brett, and  Russell and Brett came down to just a nail-biter. It was just... I mean, watching these things back and forth. And you're just like Russell is shaking, Brett looks focused. Now Brett's swinging. I mean, it was really, really intense. And once Brett's fell it was just this... (sighs) this sigh of relief. <br/>How you doing? <br/>I'm doing great. Really good. I mean, really your fate is out of your own hands at this point. Whether you won or lost that challenge, whether someone goes home tonight or  makes it till-- till the end, I'm definitely proud-- I really am proud to  make it this far, so...  Well, you should be. You had a pretty amazing streak there. <br/>It's definitely-- definitely been an awesome experience, for sure. I'm like a little girl, all emotional. <br/>Well deserved. <br/>Yeah. I failed. Because I was unable to win the immunity challenge today, I'm pretty certain  that I'll be going home tonight. The only thing I have to fall back on is Russell's deal that he made with me  that if one of us were to win, we would take the other person to the finals. <br/>So what do you all think of my chances of winning a million dollars now? <br/>I think that you're going to win, hands down. <br/>Because now that I took out Brett, and I played the game. <br/>I think hands down you'll win. <br/>I think I've got a good shot now, man. <br/>You've got a great shot. <br/>I do, too. <br/>So what do you think Galu is going to say when they see me walk in with that? <br/>I think they're going to be, like, ticked in a way, but then...  I think they're going to say it's fitting. You know, I've played it strategically the whole time, and then at the very  end when the biggest threat that I had to me to win the money, I had to beat,  and I did. So, you know, it's going to be part of my speech now. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Throw me the coconut over there, would you? <br/>I wish I was like him when I was his age. You know what I mean? He's the kind of guy that I want my daughters to meet one day. You know, really. <br/>Yes, you would. He will be a fantastic husband and father. He's just a great kid. <br/>I made a promise to Brett, telling him that me, Brett, and Natalie will go to  the final three. But, you see, I made a promise to Mick, too. So either way I slice it, if I break my promise with somebody, I'll be  putting them on the jury, they'll taking it personal-- that hates me. This is where the game gets tough. <br/>What's going on, guys? <br/>What? <br/>There some funny business going on? <br/>Uh-uh. What do you mean? <br/>I don't know, I've never seen Russell want to go get wood. Maybe I'm just, I'm kind of a skeptic, I guess. I just don't really-- I don't know. <br/>No matter what, we get to be clean tomorrow. <br/>At some point. <br/>And eat. Eat and be clean. <br/>I almost want to cry. <br/>I know. <br/>See? What's going on? <br/>Mick, you're fine. Do not-- you're the most paranoid person. <br/>I've never seen Russell go get firewood ever in 39 days. <br/>Mick. Yeah? You are so paranoid. Have I let you down yet? Have I? <br/>Everybody's talking about me. <br/>Are you on drugs? Do you honestly think any of us want to go against him on the jury? No! <br/>I wouldn't think so, but Russ has all these little strange plans and ploys. <br/>No, no, Mick. It's done. It's a done deal. <br/>Good, man. <br/>You're coming back here tonight, and so am I, and so is Russell. It's the three of us. We're coming back here. <br/>You know that I made a deal with you. The problem I'm weighing in my mind is I made a deal with everybody. And you're the kind of guy I want my kids to marry. You're the kind of guy I want my daughters-- I wish I was like you when I was  your age. And I ain't just saying that. <br/>And I appreciate that. <br/>So the only option we have is Natalie is going to vote you, and Mick is going  to vote you. If I vote Mick...  And I vote Mick. <br/>...and you vote Mick, then it's a 2-2 tie. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And then it's a challenge, it might be a fire challenge. Do you think you could beat Mick in a fire challenge? It's like you still have another challenge. You're still working your way to the end? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Russell and I have talked over agreements for each other previously in this  game. It's hard to take his word 100% and know that he's going to stick behind it. All I can really do right now is hope that he's, you know, a man of his word,  and will fall back on his actions. <br/>I've been wearing a necklace-for a long time in this game. The hidden immunity idol. And I finally get the real deal. Definitely better late than never, because look where it came. It came on the last one. The one that puts me in front of the jury to win this game. Right now, you have to worry about jury votes. And that's all I'm thinking about right now. How can I get more jury votes? Brett's a real good guy. I like Brett a lot. Mick, he's a good guy, too. But I'm playing a game. I'm still strongly considering keeping Brett. May the best man win. Everybody would be shocked if I did that. But you know what? I think that might get me jury votes-- keeping the strongest here. My head's spinning now. It gets tougher and tougher. Every time you think it can't get any tougher than this, but now I'm damned  if I do and I'm damned if I don't. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Erik. Kelly. Laura. John. Dave. Monica. Shambo. And Jaison, voted out at the last Tribal Council. So let's talk about today, your final immunity challenge. Mick, you're out first, Natalie right behind. Leaves us with the showdown. Russell and Brett. Russell, this had to be how you wanted it to go down, going up against a guy  who's been a very strong competitor in this game. <br/>Definitely. I knew he would be the one that would be there with me at the end, and I  thought, I lose, I go home. I came to win. I didn't come to even come second. So I put more effort into this challenge than I have into anything in this  entire game. <br/>Probst: Brett, did you figure it would be Russell that might be the one to  give you a run for your money? <br/>Oh, yeah, I mean without a doubt. He's got the mentality that is "I have to win." and that's the  mindset I've been having the past few immunity challenges. <br/>Probst: Mick, the minute Brett goes out of this challenge and he's  vulnerable, did you know that's it, he's going home? <br/>Yeah, absolutely, right away. You know what I mean. He's been such a competitor, but it was a huge relief. <br/>Probst: Natalie, no doubt in your mind? Easy decision? <br/>Yes. Absolutely. <br/>Probst: Now, Russell, is there a part of you that can appreciate the  competitor in Brett? The guy has lasted a long time with the odds against him. <br/>Right. He played a great game. And it's because I respect the game so much, he deserves to be sitting up  there with me. I mean, you know, we're probably the two best up here. And you want the best with you to talk in front of jury. You know, that's just how it should be. <br/>Probst: Mick, surprised by Russell's comment about maybe it's fair to take  Brett to the end because he's earned it more than somebody else up here? <br/>Yeah, I think he makes a pretty good case. I mean, it's not one I would agree with per se. I would tend to think the opposite. You know, Brett going in front of that jury, none of us have a chance at a  million bucks. <br/>Probst: Natalie, a little surprised? <br/>No, actually, I'm not surprised. Because, again, Brett has been an outstanding competitor. But Russell knows strategically, it's not a good move at all to take Brett  and put Brett in front of the jury. <br/>Probst: Brett, do you sense a little bit of worry from Natalie and Mick? I'm even hearing it, Natalie, right now, almost like she's talking to Russell  saying, "You know that's not a good move, right?"  Well, I mean, if Russ truly felt that he wanted to go up against the best,  you know, they've got to be a little worried. <br/>Probst: If Russell made a vote to keep you in the game, do you think Russell  then earns respect from the jury? <br/>Oh, yeah. Most definitely. I mean, by that action, you're showing a sense of confidence within yourself  and shows quite a bit of character to say, hey, you might beat me at this,  but I'm going to put you up against me and we'll put it to the test. <br/>Probst: So based on what I'm hearing you guys say, what at one point was an  absolute certainty, Brett going home, now has a bit of suspense. We'll see how it plays out. Russell has the individual immunity necklace. I know you're not giving it up. You cannot vote for Russell. Everybody else is fair game. Mick, you're up. <br/>Hell of a competitor, man. Props to you. I got nothing but love for you. <br/>(whispers): Brett, I'm voting for you because we have no shot at beating you  at the final. <br/>Probst: Russell. I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Brett. Mick. One vote Mick, one vote Brett. Brett. Two votes Brett, one vote Mick. One vote left. 15th person voted out and the ninth and final member of our jury, Brett. You need to bring me your torch. Brett, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Great game, guys. <br/>Bye, Brett. <br/>Thanks for the adventure. <br/>Probst: Well, you have gone a far as you can go in this game. Tomorrow you will get a chance to plead your case to the jury about why you  deserve the million dollars and the title of sole survivor. You have one more night in in Samoa. Hope you can enjoy it. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>I knew, you know, a couple of Tribals ago that it was my time to go. And you know, I'm the last Galu member, which I'm so proud of that, you know. To get to where I got, 38 days, one of the final four. It was definitely a testament to my will and hard work, and kind of felt like  I went out on my own accord to some degree. <br/>I can't wait to brush and floss my teeth. <br/>No more bamboo. <br/>Let's go check tree mail. <br/>I'm ready. <br/>Me, too. Oh, my word. <br/>Strawberries? <br/>Oh, my goodness. Pancake mix. <br/>Sausage and onions. Civilization. Oh! <br/>Sausage. Oh, my goodness. Grab that one end. (cork pops)  Yay! We're here on day 39. <br/>Yes, indeed. I think we need a toast. Final three. <br/>Final three, Foa Foa. <br/>From the get-go. <br/>May the best man win. You know, I said from day one I was gonna get here, and here I am. <br/>Wow. Very good. Isn't that great? <br/>Not only did I get here, I brought two people here that I wanted to be here  with me. They're gonna say I took you the whole way. They're gonna say you couldn't have made it without Russell. What you gonna say? <br/>It's in God's hand at this point. If I'm not meant to win, that's fine. I'm happy I made it to the third. <br/>You see, you haven't been thinking about your speech too much, then. <br/>Russell, no, I... All of them questions. <br/>Guess what. Look who I aligned with from the first day. <br/>Oh, you, so you saying you set up the alliance. <br/>No. Okay. <br/>So what did do you strategically in this game? If you want second place, you have to do better than that. <br/>What about Mick? He was the nice guy, you know. <br/>Well, don't think I'm going to eat up on that, too. I'm just saying, here behind me I have sitting the nice guy and the nice girl. Have they outwitted me? Have they outplayed me? If they have, then give them the money because they deserve it, so...  Russell has good points, but he needs to be reminded that he couldn't have  done this without us. I was a trustworthy, hardworking, likable guy, and I got to the same place  ultimately that Russell did. We just took totally different paths to do it. So, you know, some people may say, "Well, I liked your path a  "little better. Here's my vote."  Ease up... please. I think there may be a little bit of strategy involved to Russell making us  feel like we're not gonna win or that we don't have a chance, but I have news  for him. I'm not gonna give up, and I'll just explain to the jury, I don't work the  same way as Russell. That would clearly not have worked for me. The girls that were aggressive, they got eliminated early. My strategy was to be myself, and at the end of the day, you know, I wasn't  out to get anybody or make anybody look look bad. Russell made it clear he was okay with making people look bad. (chuckles)  I never want to sleep on bamboo ever again. <br/>Hell, no. I'm not gonna be rained on ever again. <br/>Me, either! <br/>I'm not sleeping in the cold ever again. Toss it up. This is the best fire we've had yet. <br/>Burn, baby, burn. <br/>Whoo! <br/>If Mick or Natalie won this game over me, that would just be a shame. You know, it wouldn't make any sense to me. I played this game strategically better than anybody, maybe in history. I really think this jury's gonna put my name down. I've accomplished the impossible out here all by myself and brought a couple  of bums with me. I feel strong. I feel good. I feel like I'm gonna go into this, make a great speech, and take it. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury: Erik. Kelly. Laura. John. Dave. Monica. Shambo. Jaison and Brett, voted out at the last Tribal Council. Well, congratulations on making it to the final three. Tonight, the power in this game shifts to the jury. Nine people that you had a hand in voting out now control your fate in their  hands. Very unique situation this season in that all three of you voted for every  single person on the jury. So nobody has anywhere to hide. You will each get an opening statement. This is your chance to convince them why you deserve it. The jury will then get a chance to address you. They're gonna be trying to gather information to help them decide who they  think is most worthy of the title of sole survivor and the million-dollar  check that goes along with it. Then we will vote. Everybody ready to get to it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Opening statements. Mick, you're up. <br/>All right. Uh, good evening, everyone. You know, I came into this game realizing that under the stress of this whole  process that there would be a lot of pressure to sort of give yourself a  little more moral sort of leeway than maybe I was willing to give. As underdogs coming in, I think that temptation is especially strong to do  whatever it takes to keep your head above water. I just played my whole game within sort of these parameters I really wasn't  that willing to go outside of. I made it a point not to promise too much. Not to overtly stomp on, lie or mislead people or to treat them like sort of  pawns in this game. The fact that I was able to get this far by doing that, you know, that was  kind of my goal in this, and I feel like I accomplished it. <br/>Probst: Natalie, your opening statement. <br/>You know, I came into this game with a lot of people telling me before I ever  came, "What are you doing? "You're crazy. You can't do it." And I knew I would wake up every single day, if I  didn't come do this, I would have regrets. And for me, it was definitely about wanting to, um, just gain the confidence  to go outside my comfort zone. This is the hardest thing I've ever done mentally, physically, emotionally. This experience has been very humbling for me. And without each and every one of you, I would not be sitting sitting here. I appreciate it. Thank you. <br/>Probst: Russell, your opening statement. <br/>Mine's going to be a little bit different than these two. I came here to do what I said I was going to do and try to make if all the  way to the top and win the game. I made huge strategic moves all the way through the game. My first strategic moves were in my own tribe. Marisa and Betsy. Those were the two that said "Get rid of Russell. Get rid of Russell." Guess who goes first? Marisa and Betsy. When we go to Galu, I have these guys right here behind me while I'm getting  shot at. I solidified myself with Shambo to get rid of Kelly. It was a huge move. It didn't change the game yet. Laura was the biggest move I think of the game. I had to go to John and say, "John, if you help switch your vote, I'll  vote off a Foa Foa member." So he agrees. He switches his vote at the end. Laura goes home. Then John comes to me after it's over, "We've got to get rid of a Foa  Foa." Well, I can't do that, so I have to get rid of John. Then it just went like dominoes from there. The huge move was the most difficult, trying to get rid of Brett. He won three immunity idols in a row. So I have to win physically to get rid of Brett. Now, I ask you, if either one of these outwit me, then give them the money. If either one of these out-played me, then give them the game. But you know what? I don't think that they have. The truth is where it lies. It's y'all's big decision to make tonight, and may the best man win. <br/>Probst: All right, three very different opening statements. Jury, in a moment, you're going to get your first chance to address Mick,  Natalie, and Russell. I'll give you minute to think about what you want to ask them. <br/>Probst: All right, jury. You've heard the opening statements from Mick, Natalie, and Russell. It's now your first chance to address them. You're trying to gather information to help you make a million-dollar  decision. Let's get started. Jaison. You're up first. <br/>Well, congratulations. I'm going to give you guys an opportunity to look at the jury and give them  some information about who you really are, and if you don't, I will. <br/>I'll start. <br/>Go ahead. <br/>I was in pharmaceutical sales before I came. I gave up my job, so technically, I am unemployed at this time but that is my  dream job. I want to find one when I go back home. <br/>Russell? <br/>I'm a businessman. I opened a business five years ago, struggled for three years, just became  successful with the business for two years. This is the first business that I have succeeded with. That's what I do. <br/>Mick? <br/>I finished medical school. I'm 320 odd grand in debt from that. And it's going to take me a long time to pull out of debt. I'm almost 35, and that's me. <br/>I don't think any of them have lied. But Natalie, you know, neglects to tell you that she has made a lot of money. Russell, probably the wealthiest guy on this panel, seven figures in the last  year or so, he says. You know, Mick, doctors do get paid very well, especially when you get  fellowships at one of the most prestigious hospitals in America. So whatever decision is made, no one is broke. I think you guys should look to other criteria. That's all I have to say. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Jaison. Shambo, you're up. <br/>Hi, guys. I would just like to apologize to America for dismantling Galu because I'm  really questioning that judgment call at this point. Mick, wow. Dude, you have got to be kidding me. In a word, would you agree that your overall game playing could be called...  Here it comes. <br/>...feckless. <br/>Feckless? <br/>I would have to look up feckless. I don't know what feckless is. <br/>Well, I think that's a really good idea after this is over. I'm done with you. <br/>Okay, will do, Shambo. <br/>Natalie the word that just is resonating in my mind that starts with a  "C." Can you finish it? I'm going to let you finish it, Sham. <br/>Coattail. How do you think America is going to perceive you sitting up there in the  final three? Give it to me, Natalie. <br/>I think America is going to say she came the most ill-equipped in a sundress  and gold wedges. She should have been voted out first. And you know what, I had enough intuition to notice that girl that goes out  aggressive, target, gone. Marisa and Betsy. That's not smart. <br/>I'm calling just major B.S. on your sentence that you just hit me with. I'm, like, cracking up inside like you have no idea. <br/>Okay. <br/>The jig is up. Natalie, Mick, no way in God's green Earth you're getting my my vote. Thanks for playing. <br/>Thank you, Sham. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Wow. <br/>Wow, is right. <br/>Probst: Brett, you're up. <br/>Well, first of all, congratulations. I'm definitely proud of you guys for, you know, at least beating us. So, Mick, imagine for a moment you and I are going on a little bro-date  together. What kind of stuff-- what kind of stuff would we do? <br/>Wait, wait, wait, what is it? <br/>You and I are going to go on a bro date together. Nothing sexual. Just a little guy time. So describe what that day would entail. <br/>I'll wake you up with a little sweet nothing in your ear... (laughter)  That's a good beginning. <br/>...a little tickle on the nose. No, but, uh, no, we'd get up. We'd check out the news, and grab some eats afterwards, and you know, just be  guys and talk about girls and, you know, sports and stuff like that. <br/>All right, sounds good. It sounds probably like a silly question, but basically the reason I was  asking is to see to what level did you invest with myself as a human being. I appreciate your response. You're almost done. We'll get some food shortly. <br/>Thanks. Thanks, man. <br/>Probst: Kelly. <br/>Hi. Nat, I'm going to start with you. Because I think in the beginning, we were perceived as being very similar,  you know. We were both a little bit underestimated. I had to rely on myself. I was hoping for the same thing in you. I don't think you were ever on the field. I saw you always turn to call help, whether it be these two or someone else  in every challenge. <br/>Can I answer to that? <br/>Yeah, go ahead. <br/>It wasn't because I had no fight. I've given this 100%. Yeah, maybe I'm not as good at some of the physical challenges as some other  people. I think everybody outweighed me, but I did do things on my own, and I'll tell  you, I got better throughout the game to believe in myself. <br/>Russell, you've said many times you're going to lie, cheat, and steal your  way through this game. Does that apply to your real life also? <br/>No, not at all. I am 100% different outside this game. The thing that bothered me is I don't want my kids to think that this is how  I really am. I'm not like this at all. I'm a totally different person outside this game. <br/>Instead of lie, cheat, and steal in real life, maybe what three words that  would replace that? <br/>It might be hard to believe but honor, integrity, and loyalty. <br/>Russell, it's hard for me to sit here and believe that from you. "Honor, integrity, and loyalty" is the most important thing to you? <br/>It is the most important thing to me. <br/>I guess I've heard what I need to. Good luck. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Kelly. Monica. <br/>First off, I just want to say congratulations. Russell, you played some key moves, and regardless of how you got there,  you're there. Natalie, Mick, both of you seem to have played a pretty honest game, but I  did miss passion. I want to see the fight in your answer for my question tonight. Mick, tell me why each of the two people alongside you do not deserve the  million dollars and you do. <br/>You know, I don't think Natalie deserves the money at all. I don't know, you know, what she really did along the way except align with  Russell. And through their relationship and their trust, was able to get through the  game. That was it. Russell was willing to lie to people, pit people against each other, mislead  anybody, and all the while, you know, this giant ego just got really kind of  out of hand and obsessive and I don't think that that kind of character  behavior deserves a million bucks. You don't reward that. <br/>Can I say something? You know, he's sitting over here saying I pit people against each other. You pit people against each other, also. <br/>Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude. <br/>And also, this next thing...  We're trying to-- I'm answering her question. <br/>I asked if I could speak. He didn't mind when I was being a snake and giving me high-fives every time  we vote somebody off. <br/>I never gave you high-fives. <br/>Natalie didn't mind when I was being a snake and giving me high-fives when I  voted everybody off. The two honest people here-- they were congratulating me. "Good job. That was probably one of the best jobs in history, Russell You are doing...  you are running... You should win this game. You're running the show here."  You did a great job. Those were great moves. <br/>They both-- they both didn't mind following the snake right behind me the  whole step of the way. <br/>I think I'm basically done. <br/>Probst: Dave. <br/>Hey, everybody. I do have one thing. I'm curious, I'm just going to ask everybody, what do you think your chances  are tonight? What do you think, Mick? <br/>My chances are, after this, maybe 25%, 20%. <br/>Natalie, what do you think your chances are? <br/>I'm going with maybe 30. <br/>30%? <br/>30% to 40% chance. <br/>Right on. Good game, Mama. <br/>Thank you. <br/>You're welcome. Great job. What do you say, Russ? <br/>I came in here with a lot larger percentage but it went down to about 55%. <br/>55? <br/>Yeah, I think that it's... it just might happen, might not happen. <br/>All right, thanks everybody. <br/>Thanks, Dave. <br/>Yeah, you bet. <br/>Probst: Laura, you're up. <br/>Hi. Russell, what did you learn about me that enabled you to beat me? <br/>I knew immediately you was the biggest threat on Galu, and that you were  controlling a lot. That's what I thought. Whether that was true or not, I don't know. But if-if it wouldn't have took place like it did, I don't have a doubt in my  mind you would be here right now. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Laura. John, your turn. <br/>Mick, give me the hard sell. Why should I write your name down? Hard sell, blow my mind right now. <br/>In terms of character you're not going to find a better, more solid guy up  here. You're just not. I'm one of those people that does not think that the ends justify the means  and you don't treat people like pawns. That's not my way of maneuvering through life or the game. That's essentially the type of person that you're giving money to. I don't think you can give it to a more stand-up dude up here. I just don't. <br/>Good. Natalie, you admittedly got here tucked under Russell's wing. And I value that. But what do you say to the person who's thinking, you know what, you've got  to win it now, kid. <br/>It's not that you tuck under someone's wing. It's you're smart enough to see why are they taking these people out? The most aggressive female was voted out first. I saw that from day one. Betsy was gone second. Liz was gone. I was the last girl standing. I killed a rat, for crying out loud. <br/>Not to interrupt, but you're definitely illuminating part of your strategic  thinking that I think some of us were hoping to see tonight. Thanks to all of you. That was fun. <br/>Probst: Thanks, John. Erik, close it out. <br/>I'm going to try to keep this brief, but I don't need anything from any of  you. Mick, day one, they put a leadership necklace around your neck. I go 39 days struggling to find a reason that you deserve that title. You did nothing. You did nothing with your team. You did nothing to encourage them. Nobody on that team had any guts. You're responsible for that. Russell, this hurts me. We have nothing in common. You played an unethical game, admittedly played an unethical game. The crazy thing about it is is you're sitting there and I'm standing here. Did you get to the right place by behaving the wrong way? I've never been in a situation in my entire life where that he was the case,  but you sit there proud of it. Natalie, people will call you weak. People will say that you are undeserving. But you know what? Why are those characteristics any less admirable as lying, cheating, and  stealing? Why does he get a free pass, but your wrong way of playing is admonished. If there's one thing that I learned in this game it is that perception is not  reality. Reality is reality. And you are sitting there and that makes you just as dangerous as any one of  those guys there. You would say that you were probably the least deserving of the title of sole  survivor. But maybe, just maybe, in an environment filled with arrogance, delusional  entitlement, maybe the person who thinks that she's least deserving is  probably the most. You got my vote. I hope you get four more. Congratulations. <br/>Probst: Jury, thanks for a very lively and interesting Tribal Council. In a moment, the nine of you are each going to make a million-dollar vote. I'm going to give you a moment to take all of this in, figure out what you  want to do. <br/>Probst: All right, jury, we've had a very interesting final Tribal Council  due in no small part to the fact that we've had three finalists who played  very different games, and based on the questions tonight, I can tell it is  still up in the air. So it is time to get to the votes. Tonight you are voting for a winner. The person you think most deserving of the title of sole survivor, and the  million dollars that goes along with it. For the last time, it is time to vote. Laura, you're up. <br/>You came a long way and I think that's something to be proud of. Enjoy this. I hope you get it, buddy. You're the only one up there that is deserving of $1 million in my humble  opinion. <br/>Probst: I'll go get the votes. I know 39 days is a long time out here. Thank you for a great season of Survivor. See you back in Los Angeles for the reading of the votes. (cheering and applause)  Probst: How's everybody doing. You guys all right? Have a seat. Thanks for the nice welcome. It is nice to be live for the reading of the votes. First of all, I want to give a hand to you guys. This was a very, very tough season. (cheering and applause) I watched what you guys went through. I can vouch for it. You have my respect regardless of how well you did in the game, just  embarking on this adventure. So here's where we stand. We're down to three, Mick, Natalie, Russell. And a jury of your peers, nine people that you played alongside, will now  decide the outcome. It's one of the unique aspects of Survivor that you guys control the world. You make up the rules. You decide how it goes. So while Mick, Natalie, and Russell, you got to the end, you put yourself in  a position to win the money-- that's not enough. You need the votes. Let's get to it. There are nine votes in here. These are votes for a winner. I will now read the votes. First vote, "Ratalie." (cheers) That's one for Natalie. Russell. (cheers) One vote Natalie, one vote Russell. Natalie. (cheers) Two votes Natalie, one vote Russell. Russell. (cheers) We're tied. Two votes Natalie, two votes Russell. Natalie. (cheers) That's three votes Natalie, two votes Russell. Natalie. (cheers) Four votes Natalie, two votes Russell. It takes five to win. The winner of Survivor: Samoa, Natalie. (cheering and applause)  Good job, man. You kept your head up. <br/>Good job, Jaison. You look good. <br/>Good job, Shambo. (cheers and applause)
