<br/>Probst: Previously on Survivor:Go! Paschal won the reward challenge and brought Neleh with him on a cruise ship. <br/>I'm so lucky to be here with you. Oh, my heck. <br/>Probst: The other tribe members suspected Neleh was not all she seemed. <br/>She's playing sweet, little girl next door, and before you know it, "Hey, I'm in the finals and I'm so happy, oh, God, oh heck." Probst: Tammy and the General were concerned about their chances for staying in the game. <br/>I catch a pig, you win immunity. Look, she's immune-- you got to keep me, I got pig. <br/>Probst: But instead it was the general who won immunity... Sanctuary. <br/>Probst: ...leaving Tammy vulnerable and she was voted out at Tribal Council. Tammy, the tribe has spoken. Six are left. Who will be voted out tonight? [thunder rumbles] Who will be voted out tonight? [thunder rumbles] [rain pattering] [snoring] [rain pattering] [snoring] The mood is, there's a lot of anxiety because the time has been very long, and everyone's feeling depleted. We're just depleted energy-wise, you can feel it. Then everybody, just over the past two three days has been talking about missing home, moms, wives, boyfriends. So it's getting really old. And I was good about it even up until like I'm here three days ago. And I wake up now and I have no idea, I'm sobbing in the morning under the stars, it's weird. Because I know he's fine. My son is fine. He thinks it's great. You know, his mom is out here in the jungle, trying to do this game. But it's just really uncanny to see what's happening with our mental stability. <br/>We need something on the other side. <br/>You know what? Slide some of it that way. Yeah, like that. <br/>Whoa! <br/>Oh, Sean. <br/>I got you. Just let go. <br/>The people in our lives here, we're spending 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with some of these people. You pick up a new family, and if you do the math, you're spending probably 900 plus hours with, intense hours, with a lot of individuals that you've never known. But by the end of that 900 hours, you know them probably better than anybody in your life other than your immediate family, certainly better than your best friends, because if you were with your best friends a couple hours a week, which most of us are because of our jobs, won't allow us to do any more than that, you know, how many years does it take to collect 900 hours? <br/>We were eating the taro root and V and I and Sean almost simultaneously, our mouths just started burning like we had cuts and sores. So I don't know what happened. All I know is I'm not eating taro any more. <br/>Okay, now lift up your tongue. No blisters. I just want to make sure there weren't icky blisters forming. <br/>It's really weird to miss home so much and then have this family here and then you're going to go back home where you really want to be, and I know what's going to happen. You know, we're going to miss the others. <br/>I got to think about what I'm doing out here, and I'm out here to win this game right now, and I just cannot focus on my family and fall into depression like other people are doing. You know, thinking about their mom, thinking about their wives and husbands and sons and daughters. I got to think about what I'm doing out here. I'm out here to win this game right now, and that's it. <br/>Whoo! <br/>I'll open. <br/>Make it good. <br/>Look at this thing. A turtle? What? <br/>Slow. <br/>"Each step you take can decide your fate. Which way to go, or should you wait? "It's all strategy now to get to the end. "Big night for the winner, choose just one friend." I've got no clue. <br/>Even though I'm exhausted and sick of this place, this is fun. <br/>Probst: Okay. We are now entering our second month out here. Day 31. And there's one thing that's become very clear is you guys are missing the people who matter the most to you in your lives. So I'm just wondering how you would react if I offered you a phone call home. <br/>Hell, yeah. <br/>Probst: It's not going to happen today, I was just curious how you'd react. <br/>Oh, my God, that's cruel. <br/>Love you, too, Jeff. <br/>We're about to do you one better. <br/>Probst: Neleh, here's your mom, Rebecca. <br/>Hey! Way to go girl! We're so proud of you, we love you so much. Just keep going, babes. <br/>Probst: Kathy, it's your son, Pat. <br/>Mama! [Kathy sobbing] Probst: General, say hey to your sister, Diana. <br/>Hey, Rob! <br/>Told you I I'd got you out of Maryland some day. <br/>You were right. <br/>Probst: Sean, it's your buddy Darren. <br/>Big Sean! <br/>Probst: V, your husband, Leander. <br/>What's up, baby?! <br/>Probst: And, Paschal, your lovely wife, Beverly. <br/>Hey there! We're all great, don't you worry about it. You stay focused and stay here. I love you! I love you. <br/>Probst: All right, guys, your loved ones traveled a long way to be present for this challenge. Let's do it. Each person will start on one piece of the puzzle. When it's your turn, you'll step off that piece onto another piece of the puzzle, flipping over the piece that you were just on, revealing green, and green is the reminder you can never step back on that piece. Once you're boxed in with green all around you and you can move no more, you're out of the game. The last person standing on this board wins. Obviously this is a game about strategy. You're not playing, you're the spectator. You guys will be playing. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Patrick! <br/>Oh, baby. <br/>Yes, Patrick! <br/>Come on, Le! <br/>Baby! <br/>Probst: Here are the rules you need to know. There are six skip-a-turns. If you decide, when it's your turn to step onto one of those, on your next turn you won't move. That could be a good move or a bad move, depends what everybody else does in game. There's also one wild card; you won't know you've stepped on a wild card until you've turned it over. When you turn it over, you'll reveal, "vote one person out," that means you will have to vote another loved one out of the game. Final rule, absolutely no verbal communication or help between Survivors and loved ones. Nonverbal communication is fine. As we always do in every Survivorchallenge, we will draw numbers to determine the order in which you will start, so that it's random. Let's begin. All right, guys, we're going to start. Pat, you go first. <br/>Probst: Diana. Leander. Becky. Daryl. Beverly. Remember it's okay to communicate non-verbally. If you want to look for help, that's fine. Getting really bunched up in the that's fine. Getting really bunched up in the middle. Still got some room over there to maneuver. Becky. Goes on the retreat. Strategy very important at this point. Darryl. It's only a matter of time. Leaving himself some room over there. Beverly, blocked in, no more moves. You're out of the game, Beverly, come over here. <br/>All right, Beverly. <br/>Probst: I'm not about to let you leave without a little embrace. Paschal, come on over. <br/>Watch out, out there, okay? <br/>I'll be okay... I love you. Oh, my God, I love you. <br/>You hang tough... okay? <br/>Be strong. <br/>Okay. <br/>I love you. <br/>Bye-bye. <br/>I love you. <br/>Love you. <br/>All right, Beverly. [mouthing words] Probst: All right, the game continues. Pat, you're next. Diana. Leander. Looking for real estate, everybody looking for real estate. Okay. You have to vote another loved one out of this game. Obviously you don't have any axes to grind, you don't even know these people. Part of Survivor,you don't have a choice. You can base it on strategy. You can pick a number in your head between one and ten, doesn't matter to me. One of these other four is about to be out of the game. Leander, you're out. That was a pretty fair way to do it. It's a tough break of the game. Leander, I'm sorry, come on down here. Let's go, V, come on over. <br/>I'm sorry. <br/>That's all right, hang in there, you made it this far. I love you to death. Just stay in there, all right. <br/>Way to go, V. All right, V! <br/>Home sweet home. <br/>Leander, you're the best. <br/>It's okay, baby. <br/>It's all right. <br/>Probst: We're down to four. The game continues. Pat. Darryl. You have nowhere left to move, you're out, come on down here. Come on over, Sean. Say hi to your buddy. [laughter] ...soul album. <br/>I love you brother. Tell mom's. Tell mom's. Don't forget. <br/>All right. <br/>All right, Sean. <br/>Probst: We're now down to three. <br/>Pat. Diana. Mother daughter talking with hands. Becky, that's it, you're out of moves, come on over here. Neleh, come on. <br/>...so much, Mom. Neleh, come on. <br/>...so much, Mom. <br/>Here's a little present for you. <br/>Oh, thanks. I love you. I love you, Mom! Send all my love. I love you so much. <br/>Probst: All right. Now to conclude this game, we got Kathy's son; Pat, General's sister, Diana. It's only a matter of time. Pat, you go first. Pat. Diana. It can't get any closer than this. Pat. Look at that. One piece of the puzzle is all that separated the two of you. Okay, even though you both have nowhere to go, Diana it's your turn to move. You're already boxed in. Come on over here. Well played, obviously. <br/>I'm sorry. I'm so... You're doing so good. You really are. I'm so proud of you. All right, Robby, you take care. Bring it on home. Kathy get out here and say hi to Pat. [cheering] [Kathy screaming gleefully] You did such a good job. I miss you so much. <br/>Probst: Here's how it's going to work, Kathy. You're going to hang out with Pat, have some lunch, do a little catch-up, give him an idea of what this world is like, maybe have some dinner. You'll be together tonight and you'll wake up in the morning. Welcome your new tribe member. Soliantu, you can head back to camp with them. <br/>All right. [cheering] Pat, for one night, you're a member of Soliantu. <br/>All right! <br/>Probst: Guys, take him back to camp. [laughter] Oh, God, isn't this fun! I've got such renewed energy! Thank God you're here. I think I can make to it the end. Because it has not been easy, and it's all very real. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Having my son here was a true lift, and the love coming out of my heart just having him here. You're so casual! You don't understand! We don't have any rap music out here, baby. <br/>I had so much I wanted to ask him. <br/>I forgot to ask him about if they won the national championship. <br/>Damn. <br/>I was so overwhelmed with emotion. <br/>This is the most incredible experience of my entire life. Ever, ever, ever. <br/>I'm ordering him around like a mother. <br/>She's our mother out here, just so you know. <br/>Your mama is awesome. <br/>What are you doing? <br/>I'm just looking at you, I got to check you out. Have you been lifting? Look, check it out. It's Irish. I was ripped when he did it. How is the house? Have you been partying there? Seriously, tell me the truth. <br/>No, not at all. <br/>Yes, you have, I can tell. <br/>Come on, Patrick, you wrecked the joint already. <br/>Good, yeah. <br/>Yes! I can't believe you're here! This is so weird. <br/>You know, Pat's had some good experiences in life, but he basically hangs around New England. We're going to make Patrick get the taro. <br/>That's right. <br/>We're going to make him crush the troka. <br/>And we're making Patrick crush all the troka. <br/>I get a break. <br/>Now, the key is just to do whatever you want, drop it. <br/>Is it hard to smash? <br/>Big Rob just lets it drop a little lower. <br/>You let the rock do a lot of the work. <br/>Yeah. [laughing] You might want to hang onto it? <br/>Oh, I got you. Yeah, that's fine. [laughter] Oh... Give it an umph. Everything is fine with money? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Good job! <br/>Good job! <br/>Can you believe it? We eat that. Look at this boy! <br/>Eww. [laughter] I've never been an outdoor person. I've been the preppy little kid from the East Coast. I like my TV and my couch, coming out here, it's just like wow, it's a whole another word. <br/>It's so good to have you here. Can I go home? Not yet. <br/>Your first flavor of Mom's porridge. <br/>Nasty food. <br/>If you swallow it with an apple it's not too bad. <br/>It's really not good. I give them credit for eating it every day. <br/>Patrick and I, we went into the jungle and we were harvesting taro for our dinner. Oh, that's a great one! That is the joy that we get when we find good roots. You look like a natural! <br/>Yeah. I'm a real natural. It was muddy and disgusting, got my hands all dirty which I usually don't do. I'm usually a pretty boy. I don't know what my buddies are going to think. They'll think I'm crazy. They'll think my mother is crazy. You're crazy. <br/>Am I crazy? <br/>Yes. <br/>I'm not crazy! <br/>Everybody got something out of that. I am so glad. <br/>I am so happy. <br/>Yeah, everybody did, Pap. <br/>Doesn't it feel so good to kiss Beverly? When I saw Leander for the first time, I wanted to touch him to make sure he was real, and there was so much going on and he was just smiling and looking so... scrumptious. Looking so good! And I just, I was just so elated. <br/>Man, all I can do is keep seeing him walking out of there. <br/>I'm like, "Mom, concentrate." I know that she was so excited that she wasn't listening to his directions. <br/>He told me everybody, all my boys, all my family are praying for me. <br/>It was, you know, home being brought to each one of us. <br/>I just told my sister how much I loved her. <br/>I guess it's just human nature. Once you get towards the end of something like this, your intensity of your thoughts of home are really more acute than ever. It's really a wonderful opportunity that I've had to come out here and, you know, I'm 57 years old and for the first time in my life, I have come face-to-face with myself. And, um... some of the things I've seen and reflect on, I'm not real proud about. How much I take for granted, and, you know, what a wonderful situation I have and a wonderful wife, and, you know, I'm determined when I go back home that a lot of that is going to change. We're the most blessed nation in the world. We just take so much for granted, and it takes an experience like this to realize what you can really do without, and what really is important in your life. And it's not a fancy car and it's not the number of TVs you have and it's not your bank account and it's not the clothes you wear. It's, it's the people in your life. <br/>Being out here, I've really learned not to take the small things of life for granted. I mean, there are so many times where you buy a loaf of bread and you got three little pieces and the ends left, "Oh, we don't need these" and toss them in the garbage can. To be out here knowing that we are scraping the last bit of food out of a coconut husk makes me realize that going home I need to think twice about what I'm doing. <br/>I need your help. What I need help on is the game. And I have to tell you something. I respect how you play games. So here I am, I have this loyalty to Paschal and Neleh. Well, Paschal and Neleh are like father and daughter, you've seen them together. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You can feel it. So if we get down to the final three, Pascal and Neleh are voting me off. Unless I get immunity. So how do I get in the game? Because they're going to boot me. So the way to get back in the game is sort of right now... Vote with Sean and V. <br/>But if I end up in the final three with Sean and V, they'll vote me out. So the key player here is Rob, I have to make a decision to go to Rob, V. and Sean. Do I go to those three people and form an alliance of four against Paschal and Neleh and look like a total... Bitch. <br/>...bitch. Help me. <br/>You've got to hope that Rob gets immunity. That's about it. <br/>No, I'm saying I could form the alliance today, before the challenge. All of this is seductive and cunning and it's not like me. <br/>Yes, I don't like this side of you. <br/>But that's what the game does to you. <br/>I know. <br/>All of a sudden, I'm just trying to play the game. So what do I do? <br/>I don't know, I never played a game like this before. <br/>You got to help me though. I got my family here, my most trusted ally. <br/>It's messed up-- the situation they put you in. <br/>It is messed up. If I won the million bucks now, if I were to form this alliance of four...? Patrick, I'm so proud of you. You looked so good up on that game board. <br/>You did. <br/>What's your favorite meal, Patrick? Let's talk about something we all love talking about. <br/>Favorite meal? Cheeseburgers. <br/>Cheeseburger? <br/>I love cheeseburgers. <br/>What's your favorite dessert? <br/>Tumbleweed. <br/>What's that? <br/>What's Tumbleweed? <br/>A bed strawberries, take a clump of vanilla ice cream, roll it in coconut. <br/>Oh, you just ruined it, man. You just ruined it! <br/>He mentioned coconut! <br/>Pick a different dessert. <br/>What's your second favorite dessert? <br/>I slept terrible last night. Slept on that... grass. It wasn't very comfortable. But I slept a little. I'm glad I can sleep in a bed tonight. <br/>Patio... Do you have to go home? <br/>Yes. I'd love to stay, but... Actually, no I'm not interested in staying for another 24 hours. <br/>You don't like it here? [engine humming] Hey, you guys, Patrick's got to go. <br/>Stop that. <br/>I know. <br/>Come on, now. <br/>I'm fine. <br/>It's okay to cry. <br/>It's just weird that you came and then you're going, it's just odd. <br/>I love you being here. Thanks for taking care of my mom. <br/>Yeah. It ain't over, man. <br/>Thanks so much for everything. <br/>All right, buddy. <br/>Hey, enjoyed meeting you. <br/>Nice meeting you, too, man. <br/>I'll see you later. <br/>You're a great kid. Wonderful meeting you. Be blessed, okay? <br/>Thank you. <br/>All right. <br/>Have a good time. [laughter] Yeah, we'll have a ball. Anyway, thanks for coming. <br/>It was awesome. <br/>Thanks for stopping by. <br/>Nice taste of the life we left behind. <br/>Of the life we're getting ready to see. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Stop it. <br/>Okay. <br/>Go back, have fun. <br/>I know, I'll be fine. I don't know why I'm crying. <br/>Be yourself. <br/>I know. <br/>Bye. You look so good! Can you hear me? <br/>Yeah. You look really good. <br/>You do, too! <br/>[laughing] Yeah... Peace, baby, I love you. I don't want to get depressed Peace, baby, I love you. I don't want to get depressed out here. So I just use his strength to come back, and come back to this game and just finish it out. You know, finish what you start, that's always been my motto to him, so that's my motto to myself, even though it's feeling very peculiar out here, it's stupid. He gave me a lot of strength, but it's hard to see him go. It's crazy, and he kept saying, "How crazy this is, Mom." I said, "Yeah, it is crazy." But I'll finish it. <br/>Yeah, Sean and V are a little pissy. <br/>Are they? <br/>Yeah. <br/>At each other? <br/>No. <br/>At us? <br/>No. Neleh. <br/>When did you see that? <br/>Well, Sean said something yesterday. And V said to me today, she goes, "You definitely deserve to be here longer." I'm feeling vulnerable because it seems like if you look at the way it's going, each member of the jury was part of old alliance, you know? And it seems like they're being picked off one by one and I'm the last one left. But this game has so many twists, turns, just when you think you know what's going on, you have no idea what's going on. <br/>Do you think Paschal and Neleh will be in the final two? <br/>No, I think... Doesn't it feel that way? <br/>I think that's the way it's planning out. <br/>I know. <br/>Do you think there's a way to change it? <br/>Everything about yesterday was so amazing, though, seriously. Just being able to see our family. My mom was so happy. I'll never forget that look on her face for as long as I live. <br/>"I am so happy to be here, my mom came, and I am so happy that I saw..." You know, I didn't even get to see my mother. Basically V and I feel like Neleh is riding on Pappy's coattails. I feel like she's been playing the girl next-door role, way, way to the next level. "You guys, this is so fantastic that we're here. You know, guys, I just love it when we just sit out here. You know, guys, I'm always feeling like I'm in Disneyland." Nobody, not even Paschal is going to be offended if we play the game and knock him out, nobody. <br/>I know. I don't want to vote for him either... But I couldn't vote for him over Neleh. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I couldn't see, I couldn't vote for him over Sean either. <br/>But I've got to tell you, Paschal is our strongest adversary. <br/>You know, we're within a week now, so... It definitely gave me the strength I need to finish this thing out. There's no way in the whole wide world I would ever give up now, Paschal, ever. No way. <br/>You know, cute little Mormon girl. Sweet little Mormon girl, ain't got jack to do with this game. <br/>If we truly are going to go all out fighting to the end... Mm-hmm. <br/>...she got to go. <br/>Neleh talks about it a lot. <br/>Does she really? <br/>Oh, yeah, she talks about it all the time. <br/>She plays more than I think she does sometimes. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Woo! I love it! Woo! <br/>There she go with the BS. I hear her loud mouth already. Disneyland. <br/>Woo! <br/>If I end up in a final three with Paschal and Neleh, they've got such a tight bond, they would vote me out. My other issue is if I'm in the final three with V. and Sean, definitely they're going to bond and vote me off. So theoretically, strategically, I should do this, and Rob and I should become a unit. <br/>Anything can happen in this game. After yesterday, you could definitely see, you know, after reward challenge-- seeing where everybody saw their family-- this game takes you through every mental, emotional and physical high and low there is. So, you know, anything can happen. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. First things first. Hate to do it. Got to take the immunity necklace back. Thank you. Once again, immunity, back up for grabs. Today's immunity challenge will test your proficiency with a slingshot. Each of you have a color-coded hourglass structure filled with sand. At the base of the structure is a tiki. On my command, you will each fire one rock at another tribe member's structure. Each time you hit a tile, you release sand, the sand begins to cover the tiki. Once a person's tiki is completely covered, they're out of the game. To keep things fair, after each shot, you'll rotate one space over. Last person left standing wins immunity. Everybody square? Grab your rocks. All right, guys, everybody ready. Take your aim. Fire! Sean took a little hit. The first hit, Robert. That will do a little damage, but that's not going to cover it. Everybody rotate one. To your right. Kathy, you go down to the end. Ready, aim, fire! <br/>Yeah. <br/>Whoa! <br/>Good one, Rob. <br/>General, nice shot, that may do it. Paschal, you're out of the game. Survivorsready! Aim, fire! V took a little bit of a hit. Big hit on Sean. <br/>Oh, damn! <br/>You're getting buried, bud! <br/>Probst: Sean, that's it, you're out of the game. <br/>The women rule this place, let's do this. <br/>Chicks! <br/>Probst: Survivorsready, aim, fire. V. hits the General. Very close, General. That's it, General, you're out. The guys have been eliminated. We're down to Neleh, V, Kathy. <br/>The chicks are in the final. <br/>Do the chick dance. Get serious. <br/>Probst: Ready, aim, fire! Another hit on Vecepia, top left by Kathy. Neleh, misses her shot at V. Vecepia big hit on Neleh. Neither one covered the tiki. Ready, aim, fire! Neleh and V both connect on Kathy. <br/>You buried me big, thanks a lot. <br/>Probst: Your tiki is complete covered. Neleh, nice hit. Kathy, you're out of the game. This is it, we're down to two. V at Neleh. Neleh looking for V. Survivorsready. Aim, fire. <br/>Woo! <br/>V connects with Neleh, but no sand up in the top of the structure. <br/>Going to be a close one. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: The wind is helping you out, V. One good hit by either one of you, will put the other one out. Survivorsready, aim, fire. <br/>Dang. <br/>Everybody rotate. Neleh has got the best shot she could hope for right now. V.'s got the best shot she could hope for. You guys are both lined up in front of each others. Survivorsready, aim, fire. Two big misses. Survivorsready, aim, fire. V. got a little hit on Neleh. <br/>Gosh! <br/>Oh, yeah! Woo! <br/>Probst: Neleh, you're out. V wins immunity. [screaming] Yeah, baby! Oh, give it to me! Thank you, Jesus! Yeah! Woo! Yeah! Yeah! Thank you! Thank you, Jesus! Yes! <br/>Probst: You are safe from tonight's vote. <br/>Woo! <br/>I am feeling vulnerable Woo! <br/>I am feeling vulnerable because of the past alliance that I had made, and if it comes back to bite me, it comes back to bite me. I will not change my fate by pleading or begging or talking to anybody. If they have a mind-set that I'm the next one to vote out, then so be it. I came here with four things, and that was pride, dignity and integrity and a knapsack. And the only thing that's tattered right now is that knapsack. Everything else is intact. Plus an added extra bonus of the relationships or friendships that I have made here. <br/>I love you, babe. <br/>I love you, too. <br/>Things have changed. My motivation and direction has changed. Rob voted against us. When he had the alliance with Tammy and John, we were on the chopping block. So it's now Rob's turn to get chopped. But Paschal and Neleh, they need to be severed. That unit needs to be severed, because they're acting as a twosome, and I was the odd man out, and Paschal and Neleh will totally understand that. <br/>I could be the next one going out tonight if V and Sean and Rob and Kathy decided to join a four alliance together and boot me and Paschal out. I mean, there's still a lot of ways the game could twist, you never know what's going to happen. <br/>Probst: I'll now bring in our happen. <br/>Probst: I'll now bring in our jury. John, Zoe and Tammy, who you voted out last week, they'll be eavesdropping tonight, gathering information, ultimately that will help them decide which one of you will be the last one standing. Let's talk about gamesmanship now. Kathy, tell me about your own discovery, as you got into this game, the realization that, wow, everybody is playing, we all just play differently, and how does that alter how you look at everyone? <br/>I definitely came into the game thinking that I was going to be able to summarize everybody's motives much sooner. And I would say 80% of the people had a mask on. So I could not read it. <br/>Probst: Are the masks off now? <br/>No, I don't think so, no. The masks are not totally off. <br/>Probst: V, would you agree with that, has everybody played their cards yet? <br/>I wouldn't say that everybody has played their cards just yet. I believe that there may be some people that started the game late and are enjoying the ride now, and maybe are waiting to the last hurrah to really throw in their trump card. You just try to expect the unexpected and go for what you know. <br/>Probst: General, what was your first impression of V? <br/>First impression was a very nice lady. We didn't really talk much, but just seemed very nice, quiet, easygoing. <br/>Probst: How would you describe V today? <br/>A player, definitely a player. Stronger than I thought. Definitely deceptive. <br/>Probst: Sean, anybody here you underestimated now that you're 33 days in. You think, wow, never expected that? <br/>Definitely Neleh. Out of anybody up here, she's definitely playing the game if you were to watch, and I don't mean that negatively, I mean that kind of as a complement or however else she's going to take it, but she's not the girl nextdoor. Although upon looking at her you may think that because she's very sweet. <br/>Probst: Paschal, you've been pretty clear and honest that you and Neleh sort of have had a bond, like a father-daughter bond from the beginning. How would you assess her as a player in the game? <br/>She's 21 years old, but I promise you, she's got as much intelligence and cunning as anybody sitting up here or sitting on the jury. You don't deceive this young girl, and if you do, you only do it one time. <br/>Probst: Neleh, couple of people very surprised as they I've gotten to know you, more of a player than they expected. What's your own assessment of yourself? <br/>You know, I just think I kind of fell through the cracks. You know, definitely underestimated. I wasn't seen as a threat because I wasn't the most outspoken person. So I realized that I wasn't going to make it past, you know, number six if I didn't speak up and tell people how I felt. But I want to make it to the end. <br/>Probst: Vecepia, nice job today winning immunity. <br/>Oh, it felt good. <br/>Probst: One of the new rules, you can give that immunity up if you like. <br/>Well, since this is the first time that I've won it, it feels very good on. So this baby is going to stay with me tonight, and we'll see what happens in three days. <br/>Probst: It is time to vote. Paschal, you're first. I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, General. Sean. Rob, General. Two votes General, one vote Sean. That's three votes. The 11th person voted out of the tribe, the General. You need to bring me your torch. General, the tribe has spoken. I know it's been a long, General, the tribe has spoken. I know it's been a long, emotional couple of days. Keep your head in this. You've made it down to five. It's anybody's game. You can head back to camp. I'll see you tomorrow. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:With the alliance of four now completely gone... I thought Rob was my only out, but I had to stick with the majority, so I took out Rob. <br/>Probst: ...new battle lines are drawn. <br/>I feel that Sean and V have a very, very tight bond. <br/>Don't use me and V as a scapegoat. Because V And I are African- Americans, does that mean we're an automatic alliance, no. <br/>I always say knowledge is power and all the knowledge that I accumulated in every conversation I had, every event I took part in, is knowledge that I will take from Tribal Council over to the jury and judge the people who have judged me tonight. So remember, the day of reckoning comes for all. Give me about six weeks and I'm ready to do this all over again, and that's about it, that's all I got to say.
