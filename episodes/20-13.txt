<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor: In just over 30 days, the alliance of  Parvati, Danielle, alliance of Parvati, Danielle, and Russell built an empire. and Russell built an empire. [Parvati laughs]  Probst: They had coerced Jerri and Sandra into voting with them, and whittled  the Heroes down to only two members. <br/>Colby and I are standing out on a sinking ship now. There are no other Heroes. <br/>I trust you. <br/>Probst: But Sandra had been secretly working against Russell's alliance. <br/>You want Russell gone? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Russell's gone. <br/>Probst: And she had just found a hidden immunity idol that she kept secret. <br/>I think I'm gonna keep it for myself because I'm so damn greedy. <br/>Probst: When Rupert lost the last immunity challenge... Russell wins immunity! ...it was clear he was the next to go. But Russell saw Danielle and Parvati growing too close for comfort...  To me, they're a team, when it's supposed to be me and Parvati. And that's a problem. The only thing I can think of right now is to break up that couple. <br/>Probst: ...so he targeted his own alliance. <br/>Danielle. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: He secured votes from the Heroes and tried to get one from Jerri. <br/>You don't get rid of Danielle, you gonna be after her. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Danielle broke down...  [sobbing]: I'm a freaking wreck! I'm so exhausted. This is too much for me right now! <br/>Probst: ...and let slip how tight her alliance was with Parvati. <br/>I'm closer to Parvati than you think. <br/>Oh, really? <br/>Probst: So Russell gave the signal and brought his empire crashing to the  ground. Danielle, the tribe has spoken. Now everyone's left to scramble for new alliances. Six are left. Six are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>It was a wonderful Tribal Council once again for me. Every day, my chances of winning this game get better winning this game get  better and better. and better. and better. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I know. [sighs]  I know. [sighs]  I know. [sighs]  I don't, I don't know. <br/>I don't, I don't know. <br/>I think Russell was jealous of my relationship with Danielle, and he wanted  to make sure that it was him and I that were the closest two. Here he comes. The move that Russell made tonight has made me completely distrust him. Russell is the biggest villain that this game has ever seen. But I still need to be nice to Russell, because I still need to get Colby and  Rupert off before anyone else. Then, I can deal with Russell Then, I can deal with Russell after that. after that. <br/>I believe the decision today saved my butt. When Danielle said, "We're "closer than you really think,  Russell," the switch went off in my head and I was, like, "Oh,  really? "Oh, really? Did she just say that to me?" Did she just say that to me?"  I don't know if I believe Parvati any more. All of a sudden, she's worried she's next. That shows me that Parvati and Danielle werea strong team. And I just got rid of her main alliance. Now, she has nobody to lean her Now, she has nobody to lean her head on but  me. head on but me. head on but me. [theme music plays] [theme music plays] [theme music plays] [fly buzzing]  [fly buzzing]  Hey, you guys! We got something good! <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>Yes! <br/>What you got? <br/>Treemail! <br/>Come on out, look at that, read that. <br/>"Sprint." [Parvati laughs]  Oh...  It says, "Sprint. Open now."  Ready? <br/>Yes! <br/>It's gonna pop out. <br/>ALL: Oh...! <br/>It's a phone. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>How cool is that? <br/>It's a Palm. <br/>I am so excited. <br/>Palm. <br/>That is very cool. <br/>Oh, the new Palm. <br/>"Now you will have to be a leader, "Your moves trusted, your  "actions bold, "Be dependable and optimistic "For an awesome  treat, that "never gets old. "Want to know more? Check your memos."  Treemail was very different today. It was so exciting. We opened up the Sprint Palm Pre to find out what was going on at today's  challenge. So there's, like, a million applications. <br/>"Go to video."  Then we finally get to the videos. <br/>Oh, cool. <br/>Go to video. <br/>Hey, Colby, this is your bro. [all exclaiming] [Colby laughs] I just got to the island. Looking forward to seeing you in the challenge. Kick some serious butt.

I'm at the island. I'll see you at the challenge. I hope you'll be the winner. <br/>Hey, Russell. I miss you very much. And I love you and I'm looking forward to seeing you, so try to win it. [Russell laughs]  Hey, Jerri, I'm here on the island. I just got here from Germany. <br/>Oh! <br/>Love you. <br/>Hi, honey, Hi, Rupert. Oh, my gosh, I'm so excited. I get to see you at the the challenge. <br/>I cannot wait to get out there, maybe touch my wife. <br/>Love you. See you soon. <br/>Hopefully, I could win. Even if I can't, I feel lucky to be trying again for a million dollars and to  be able to share dollars and to be able to share it with the one that I love. it with the one that I love. it with the one that I love. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! So, this morning in treemail, you received a Palm Pre by Sprint. Parvati, I'll take it back. <br/>You may have it. <br/>Probst: Part of the reward of today's challenge is spending time with your  loved one. [Parvati squeals] Parvati, here's your dad Michael. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Love ya! [Parvati laughing]  Love ya! [Parvati laughing] [Parvati laughs]  Probst: Jerri, you ready for a little love? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Here's your sister, Jennifer. Come on out, Jennifer! Came all the way from Germany to see you. <br/>Oh, Jennifer, oh, my God! <br/>Oh, Jennifer, oh, my God! <br/>Oh...  Oh...  Probst: Russell, you ready to see somebody from home? <br/>My wife. <br/>Probst: All right, Melanie, come on out! Russell's not waiting. Russell's not waiting. <br/>I love you. <br/>I love you. <br/>Yeah. I love you. <br/>Yeah. I love you. <br/>I love you, too. <br/>I love you, too. <br/>Colby, here's your brother, Reed. Reed, come on out! Donaldson needs some love. Donaldson needs some love. <br/>What's up, man? <br/>What's up, man? <br/>Let's do it. [sniffles]  Probst: Rupert, there's only one person that's gonna be out there, right? <br/>That's it. That's my wife. <br/>Probst: Laura, come on out. <br/>Probst: Laura, come on out. [Rupert moans] [Rupert moans]  Happy anniversary, by the way. <br/>Happy anniversary. 12 years. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Seems like 12 months. 12 days. <br/>It feels like you've been  It feels like you've been gone for 12 months. gone for 12 months. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Sandra, you're ready. [Parvati laughs] How about Fernando, your uncle? <br/>Bring him out. <br/>Probst: Come on out, Fernando  Fernando! <br/>Fernando! [Sandra sniffles] [Sandra sniffles] [Fernando speaks Spanish] [Sandra sobs]  I love you. [voice breaking]: He would ride me on his bicycle. I couldn't have picked nobody else, since my mom can't be here. When my mother passed, she was with him. He was there with her till the last minute. She couldn't have been with better person. She loved him, and he knows that. <br/>Finish. <br/>All right. <br/>Probst: All right, you want some more of that love? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: All you have to do is win today's challenge. Loved ones, you might want to keep an ear in on this 'cause you're  participating, too. Here's how it works. On my "go," survivors, you will use a pail to scoop water from the  ocean. You must then pass it to your loved ones. They must then dump the water in their bucket. The first pair to fill their bucket wins reward. The winning pair will board a plane and be flown to a neighboring island  where you will experience the blowholes. This is a spectacular natural phenomenon. You'll enjoy burgers, soft drinks. In addition, you'll be taking with you the Palm Pre by Sprint. Now, you have the confidence to know that whatever great memories you make  during this once-in-a-lifetime experience will be safely recorded on the very  easy-to-use Sprint phone. <br/>Oh, that's great! <br/>Probst: I know it's worth playing for. We'll draw for spots and we'll We'll draw for spots and we'll get started. get started. Here we go, for reward and more time with your loved ones. Survivors ready? Go! Go! <br/>Go, Rupert! <br/>Go, Rupert! <br/>Whoo! Come on! <br/>Probst: You got to get water in that bucket and get that water in the bucket  of your loved one. <br/>Probst: Great catch by Melanie. <br/>Tell me what to do, Reed. <br/>Try to up it a little bit. There you go. Try that. <br/>Colby falls short. Parvati falls short. <br/>That's terrible. <br/>Probst: Nice catch by Laura. Jerri and Jennifer with a nice toss. <br/>Good! Good, good, good! Whoo! <br/>Probst: That's getting it done. Fernando. <br/>Nothing? <br/>Probst: Couldn't quite reach it. A little short. <br/>Think about the prize, think about the prize. <br/>Huh? <br/>Smooth. You're doing good. <br/>Reed, I'm throwing it farther. <br/>Oh, okay. <br/>Now come on! <br/>Sandra, try to wet me. <br/>Probst: Russell and Melody getting the hang of it. A lot of water going in that that bucket. <br/>In! <br/>Probst: Parvati still falling short. <br/>Oh! You gotta...  Another good catch from Jennifer. Jennifer collected a lot of water on that one. <br/>Come on, Sandra, come on! Yeah! <br/>Probst: This is anybody's challenge. Three or four good tosses and you win it. <br/>Go smoother. <br/>Reed, talk to me, for God's sake! <br/>Keep it straight, keep it straight! <br/>Probst: Every little bit helps. Melanie using her hair. Laura squeezing her shirt into the bucket. Every drop counts. <br/>Reed! <br/>I did! I held it right there, smooth. <br/>Probst: Colby blaming everythingon his big brother. He's been that way 34 days, Reed. Rupert and Laura doing very well in this challenge. [Sandra speaks Spanish]  Probst: Russell and Melody are right in this. [Fernando chuckles] A lot of water in that bucket. Jerri and Jennifer are right there, too. <br/>Oh, a good shot. <br/>Good one! <br/>Probst: Fernando and Sandra are falling out of it. <br/>Come on. I want to spend that time with you. <br/>Reed, tell me what you want. <br/>Just throw it. Just throw it high. <br/>Come on, Reed! Damn it! <br/>Probst: Little brother getting frustrated with his getting frustrated with  his big brother. big brother. We got a match going. Russell and Melanie are leading this challenge. Jennifer and Jerri right behind. <br/>Come on, Rupert. Come on, Rupert! <br/>Come on, Reed! <br/>Probst: Laura, a little bit for Rupert. <br/>It's okay. Keep going, keep going. <br/>Probst: It's Laura and Rupert Jerri and Jennifer, and Russell and Melanie. All very close. Melanie gets in a little bit from Russell. Russell's bucket starting to move a little bit. <br/>Ah, perfect! <br/>Probst: Nice toss from Jerri to Jennifer. Couldn't be closer than this. [Jerri gasps] And with that, Jerri and Jennifer win reward! [sisters shrieking]  You did good. [Fernando gasps] [Fernando gasps]  God, I miss you. <br/>God, I miss you. <br/>Probst: Jerri, Jennifer, come on over. <br/>Yay! <br/>Yay! <br/>Probst: All right, here's the the deal: Palm Pre by Sprint. Take this with you. You'll have a great time over there. To make it interesting, choose one survivor and their loved one...  Oh, Jerri! to come along with you-- once-in-a-lifetime experience. <br/>Jerri? <br/>Parvati. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Parvati and Michael. <br/>Yes! Yes! <br/>All right. <br/>Can I take one more person? <br/>Probst: All right, one more survivor. <br/>Sandra! <br/>Probst: Sandra and Fernando, joining Parvati and Michael, and Jerri and  Jennifer. [all exclaiming]  At least I get to see you. <br/>Probst: So, Russell, this close to being able to spend the afternoon with  Melanie. Hard to say good-bye? <br/>It's fine, you know? It's, I'm back to the game. <br/>Probst: All right, Melanie, say your good-bye to Russell. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Colby, say good-bye to your bro. <br/>I love you. <br/>I love you, too. <br/>Stay with it. <br/>Tell everyone I said hi. <br/>Okay. <br/>All right, buddy. <br/>Stay with it. You'll get some good food. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Probst: All right, Rupert, say your good-byes. <br/>I love you. <br/>I love you. <br/>I love you, too. [sobs]  I love you, too. [sobs]  Probst: All right, Rupert, Colby, Russell, got nothing else for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>Bye! <br/>Bye. <br/>Bye, guys. <br/>That was a terrible strategic move; all three girls? Good thing I got rid of Danielle last night, partner. <br/>You damn straight. <br/>Probst: Guys, have a great time. You earned it. Enjoy it. <br/>Yay! <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Celebrate and head out. Plane's coming for you. Plane's coming for you. [Jerri squeals] [Jerri squeals]  ALL: Whoa! <br/>That's awesome. <br/>I'd be scared to go by that hole. What if I fall in? <br/>That's like 80, 90 feet in the air. This is our Samoan fireworks. <br/>ALL: Whoa! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Yeah! <br/>We start walking towards the blowhole, and this little tiny old man throws a  coconut into the blowhole. <br/>ALL: Whoa! <br/>The coconut goes shooting up like a firework into the air, and I'm, like,  "Whoa!" and I'm, like, "Whoa!" It was really cool. It was really cool. [woman laughs] [woman laughs]  Tell me when to throw. <br/>Tell me when to throw. [all exclaiming]  Now your turn. <br/>He's got the waves timed. [all shriek]  Come on, Barb! You can do it! <br/>Okay. <br/>Time! [woman shrieks] [woman shrieks]  Yeah! <br/>Yeah! [all exclaiming]  Yeah! Honestly, one of the best parts, too, was that Jerri had that Sprint phone  with her...  Okay, wait. <br/>...'cause she was taking  ...'cause she was taking pictures of us the whole time. pictures of us the whole time. <br/>Cookies! Donuts! <br/>And then we see this huge spread of food. And now I'm like... It was amazing. Oh, my God! <br/>Oh...  These cookies are so good! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Videos on there? <br/>Oh, the video! <br/>Is there a video on there? <br/>Yeah, it is. <br/>Are you nervous? <br/>Show it to him! <br/>Hey, Sandra, I'm on the island. I'll see you at the challenge. <br/>My uncle is here only [voice breaking] because my mom passed away. And he's my favorite uncle. Um... he always helped my mom take care of us. When my mom passed, she was with him. It's been a year and a week since my mother passed. So that's why I write, "Mom, send, send help from above." And my  husband can't be here 'cause he's in Afghanistan, so having my uncle here and  being here long enough to see him is... if it ends for me, I'm happy now. <br/>This is a really, really cool reward. <br/>Going back into the game is gonna be tough. <br/>It's gonna be rough, but at least we know it's almost over. <br/>So we need to talk about this, because I can't stop thinking about it. I'm really afraid Russell is gonna be, like-- I know he's really, really mad. <br/>We got your back. <br/>Yeah, and honestly, who cares? What can he do? Get Colby and, um, Rupert to vote you off? No. <br/>No, we're not, we're not going anywhere. anywhere. <br/>I'm very concerned that Russell would be so upset that I didn't take him on  the reward that he would take it out on me in the game. <br/>If he wants to make it to the end, he's got to get rid of those two guys. That's the only way. <br/>Yeah, you're fine. You're under mine and Sandra's full protection. [Jerri laughs]  I've earned your full protection now? <br/>Yes, you do. <br/>Yes, you do. <br/>We got you. <br/>We got you. <br/>What was she thinking! It don't make any sense. That's just a bad decision. <br/>I would have never guessed in a million years her first choice was Parvati. <br/>And you know what? She should have took a guy, because it would have made more sense  strategically. Wow. <br/>When Jerri got to announce who she's gonna bring, I was fully expecting her  too bring me. Why wouldn't she? I been taking care of Jerri this entire time. She's not gonna take me? Is she gonna tell me she did it strategically? She ain't played strategically this whole game. And all of a sudden? Parvati would have done the same thing, not chose me. I saved Parvati's ass. I saved Jerri's ass. I'm draggin' 'em through the mud, both of 'em, in a million[1]dollar  game. I hope that burger literally tastes like a million dollars, 'cause that was a  million-dollar decision. <br/>Oh...  These girls are a bunch of unappreciative little bitches, both of 'em. It's time to regroup. I want to submit something here with, with y'all two. It is time to regroup. I know I'm a Villain, and I know I lied during the game. I want to trust you all the way to the final three. <br/>Um, Russell, final three. <br/>Final three. <br/>Colby... final three. <br/>I'll do it. So Russell is hot and heavy on us three-- Colby, Russell, and I-- being solid. <br/>I want you to trust me. <br/>A hundred percent. <br/>I want to believe him, but he is a Villain. But he's my best Villain I got, and if I can take the best Villain to the  final three with me, whew... I think that guarantees me a million dollars. <br/>Final three...  Do you think you have the ability, Russell, to get either, uh, Parvati or  Jerri? <br/>I think Jerri. I think I can get Jerri to go on our side. <br/>I think you can, too. All we need her for is one vote. <br/>And Parvati goes home. <br/>Oh, yes. <br/>Even though I'm pissed off at Jerri, I know I definitely can control her the  most. And when she gets back, I'm gonna have to make sure she's tight with me. I got to think about winning this game, and Parvati is a huge threat for the  million dollars. She's the only one that can give me a shot for it, in my mind. So now if Parvati doesn't win immunity, she's going home. We get rid of Parvati and we got to compete against who? We compete against Jerri and Sandra? and Sandra? We in the top three. We in the top three. <br/>Are you the last one up, Rupert? <br/>Well, you're home! <br/>We're home! <br/>Yay! <br/>When I returned to camp, I wanted to go talk to Russell, but Russell and  Colby were sleeping. sleeping. So I tried to sleep. So I tried to sleep. So I tried to sleep. [loud cracking] [loud cracking] [loud cracking] [Jerri groans] [Jerri groans]  Rupert is loud, obnoxious, selfish and totally inconsiderate. We all go to bed, and he decides now that that's a great opportunity to chop  wood, saw wood, snap twigs, break things, slam things on the ground. I'm talking, like, huge logs, dropping them on the ground. The whole ground shakes. I have never in my life seen anybodythat inconsiderate! I don't know if it's, like, incredible cockiness or just complete stupidity. I'm leaning more towards stupidity quite frankly. I want to kill Rupert right now. Honestly, I want him gone more than anything in the entire universe. I mean, it was just nuts. I couldn't sleep all night. So I got up out of the shelter to go talk to Russell. <br/>So, how was it? <br/>It was fun. But, I mean, you know, what I'm saying, like...  Was the food good? <br/>It was good. But I mean, I was worried that you were gonna be mad. And both of them were, like, "No, "he's gonna, he'll be fine, he'll  be fine." And I was really worried. <br/>No, I wasn't mad. I wasn't mad. You know, I wanted, I want you to know that whatever it takes to get me and  you to the top, that's what I want. Me and you to the top. <br/>I'm all for it. <br/>I talked to Jerri when she came back, and I'm back on board with Jerri. That makes me and Jerri very powerful in this game. And I control it 'cause I control Jerri. <br/>You know you can trust me. <br/>That's what I was worried about all day today, Parvati trying to sway you  from me. <br/>No, not even. No, not at all. <br/>That ain't gonna happen? <br/>No, it won't. <br/>I'm not gonna tell Jerri anything about voting Parvati out. We just gonna go to the immunity, and one of the guys hopefully wins it, and  then I deal with Jerri's vote right deal with Jerri's vote right before we go  to Tribal Council. before we go to Tribal Council. before we go to Tribal Council. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Give it up, Russell. [Parvati laughs] Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. Today's immunity challenge very simple in concept, a little more difficult to  to execute. With your arms outstretched, you will use the tops of your hands to hold two  poles against an overhead board. If you lower your hands even slightly, the poles will drops. The pole drops, you're out of the challenge. Last person left standing wins immunity, guaranteed a spot in the final five. Losers, Tribal Council, somebody going home. Pick your spots, we'll get Pick your spots, we'll get started. started. Everybody looks good and ready for a shot at final five. This challenge is on. This is gonna be about concentration. If you drift for even a moment, the pole will drop. The poles are very light, doesn't take much for it to fall to the side. Colby, 15 seconds into the challenge, first person out. [Colby chuckles] We have our first casualty. 15 seconds into this challenge, 15 seconds into this challenge, Donaldson is  out. Donaldson is out. <br/>Ah! <br/>Probst: Less than one minute into this challenge, Sandra now drops out. We are down to four very We are down to four very very quickly. very quickly. Russell-- the slightest slightest bit of movement, and Russell's out of this  challenge. Now we're down to three: Parvati, Rupert and Jerri. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: You've got to keep upward pressure against that overhead board. If not, those poles will fall out. [insect buzzing] Both of Jerri's poles are dead center, right where they  started. She has not moved. Oh, out of nowhere, Jerri's pole drops. Jerri's out of this challenge. We are down to two, Parvati and Rupert, fighting for a spot in the final five. the final five. <br/>Damn it! <br/>Damn it! <br/>Probst: Been up there 17 minutes now. Don't drift. Whatever you're doing, keep doing it. You can't go to Tribal Council with any sort of security. With this group of six left, you have to have immunity to be safe. Rupert starting to struggle. Really flirting with disaster. Trying to readjust his grip and almost moving that pole right off the board. Right on the edge of Right on the edge of elimination. elimination. Parvati now also has one pole right on the edge. one pole right on the edge. [fly buzzing] [fly buzzing] Rupert-- sweat starting to pour off of the face. off of the face. Shaking again. Shaking again. Shaking again. Rupert readjusting again. Rupert readjusting again. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Rupert's pole drops. Rupert's out of the challenge. Parvati wins immunity and a spot in the final five. <br/>Gosh! [Russell scoffs]  Probst: Parvati, nice job. <br/>Probst: Parvati, nice job. <br/>Thank you! <br/>Thank you! <br/>Parvati is safe at Tribal Council, guaranteed a spot in the final five. Colby, Rupert, Jerri, Russell, Sandra-- after 36 days in Samoa, somebody  going home home tonight. Grab your stuff, head back to to camp. I'll see you at Tribal. Congrats. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Parvati saved herself 100% today. So, hopefully, plan B-- Sandra So, hopefully, plan B-- Sandra goes home. goes home. <br/>Parvati wins immunity, so I don't have to make a tough decision tonight. Because if she wouldn't have won, she would have went home. That makes my decision very That makes my decision very easy tonight. easy tonight. I don't have to talk no more. <br/>I'm on board... fully. <br/>I hope so. <br/>The way I see it tonight, now, since I can't get rid of Parvati, it looks  like I'm gonna have to flip on these guys. I'm gonna have to go back to I'm gonna have to go back to the girls. the girls. <br/>I don't know. <br/>I hate Russell. I want Russell out so bad I can taste it, but them girls won't go. Everybody wants to go with Russell to the end 'cause he's so bad, that  they'll, they'll, they'll win against him. That's why he's still here. <br/>Sandra came to me saying we have to get rid of Russell. So I went immediately So I went immediately over to Russell. over to Russell. Nope, not... I'm not even worried about it. <br/>Me neither. <br/>Hey, did you say something to Rupert about getting Russell off? <br/>Why, is that what Rupert said? <br/>I don't know. Is that what he's saying right now to you? <br/>It's a good day. <br/>A real good day. <br/>Yes, sir. I want to keep Russell a little on edge, making sure he believes Colby and I  are his believes Colby and I are his solid way to the final three. solid way to the final three. <br/>Sandra. <br/>What? <br/>Are you with me or are you against me? <br/>I'm against you, Russell. <br/>I'm against you, Russell. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>What is going on? <br/>I'm just asking a question. 'Cause I have never been against her. But are you with me or are you against me? If you're against me, you're If you're against me, you're going home next. going home next. I know I ain't going nowhere. I know that. I know...  So you're telling me I'm going somewhere? <br/>No, I'm staying. I know I'm staying. I'm comfortable in this game. <br/>I'm comfortable, too. <br/>I'm comfortable, too. Why should I not be comfortable? Why should I not be comfortable? <br/>You good? <br/>I'm good. That's why I come asking you. I want to make sure we all good. <br/>It's all right, don't worry about it. [giggling quietly]  Oh, man. <br/>He's the one in the dark. [chuckles]  Rupert... Loose lips sink ships. [Jerri laughs] And yes, they did. And yes, they did. Yes, they did. Yes, they did. <br/>Who invited Boston Rob back to the party? <br/>"Are you with me or are you against me?" [Parvati, Sandra laugh]  What are y'all doing? Y'all being stupid? I mean, you on something? Y'all drinking over there? Because you're being dumb. [Parvati chuckles] Geez. <br/>They're being silly. <br/>Go ahead and keep playing around. <br/>You're so funny. [Parvati snickers]  They're making it really easy for me. <br/>I don't know what is going on right now. It's like this camp has turned into crazy town. First of all, I literally spent the entire night listening to Rupert make  loud noises. And now, Sandra and Parvati push Russell's buttons? Are you kidding me!? Don't get Russell riled up and against you. Are you kidding me?! <br/>Holler out whatever you want, but you're digging a deeper and digging a  deeper and deeper hole. deeper hole. <br/>And that's it. You start aggravating me, going crazy, and I won't trust you. And I'll be gunning for you, and that's what Sandra did. Yes, we might need to get rid of Rupert, but we might have to wait and get  rid of Sandra. So, I don't know what I'm going to do. Jerri's not gonna vote against you. I'm not gonna vote against you. That's three people. There's not enough numbers to pull anything off. <br/>Parvati was like, "Don't worry, Sandra, because I'm not writing your  name down and neither is Jerri." So Rupert is gonna go home evenif  Russell is upset. <br/>He thinks he's running everything. <br/>Mm-hmm. It's day 36, the last day for me to use the idol. I might bring it with me to Tribal Council, but I don't think I have anything  to worry about. I'd rather not use it. That's how confident I am that That's how confident I am that I am not going  home. I am not going home. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in bring in the members of our jury: Coach, Courtney,  J.T., Amanda, Candice and Danielle, voted out at the last Tribal voted out at  the last Tribal Council. Council. Sandra, at the last Tribal Council, a Villain was sent home. What was the fallout? <br/>Well, the fact that Russell and Danielle fought, a light bulb went up in  Rupert's head that maybe if me and Russell fought, he'd be saved again. <br/>Probst: So Rupert tried to stir something up between and you and Russell? <br/>Me and Rupert had a couple of words that were exchanged, and then Rupert ran  to Russell, and then Russell ran to me, "Are you with me? Are you against me?" So, of course, I was upset. <br/>Probst: Russell, tell me about your argument with Sandra. <br/>Rupert told me that Sandra was trying to throw me under the bus. And I'd really like to know if that was true, or if Rupert was trying to make  up something to stir up trouble, so immediately I have to go up to my  alliance, Sandra, and find out what's going on. <br/>Probst: And when you go up to her do you say, "Hey, can I ask "you  something? "I heard this rumor and I'd just like to know if it's true?"  [Parvati laughs]  No. I asked her...  No, he said, "Are you with "me or are you against me? "Because you can go home next like Danielle." That's what he said. <br/>She has written my name down twice in two different Tribal Councils. So, should I really trust her all the way? No. I get mad. I asked her, are you with me or are you against me? Because you can go home next if you're against me. <br/>Probst: Well, I'm guessing she said "I'm with you, Russell." She  said she's not with me. <br/>Probst: Wow. <br/>Is that what I said? <br/>That's exactly what you said. <br/>She said, "I'm against you."  She said "I'm against you."  She said she's against me. So that was the last of that conversation. She said she's against me, so she's against me. <br/>Probst: Is it still Villains versus Heroes, Parvati? <br/>[scoffs] Obviously, not. I mean, with Danielle going home. And she was a solid Villain for me since the first day. So, I mean, there's definitely room for switching it up. <br/>Probst: What would be the benefit at this point of switching it up? <br/>I don't see any benefit in voting out another Villain. When it gets down to the final three, I think it needs to be all Villains. If a Hero squeezes in there, then you've got a lot friends on the jury. So for me, I want to keep my Villains here. <br/>Rupert, what would be the reason to get rid of a Villain tonight? <br/>Strategically, for whoever is sitting in the final three, you're gonna want  to show that either you were the top Villain or the top Hero or the top  something. You're gonna want to show you had the game play to get there, and you even  turned on your own to get there. That is the game. <br/>Probst: Parvati, that was almost The Exorcistas you went to Russell. [Parvati laughs]  To me. She looked at me. <br/>I sounded like he was speaking it directly to Russell. "If you want to prove that you're the top Villain and you want to turn  on your own team," that's pretty obvious. <br/>You don't think you're the top Villain? <br/>No, I don't. I'm a Hero on the inside. <br/>Probst: Was Rupert talking to you, Russell? <br/>Um, I don't know who he was talking about. <br/>Probst: Who you talking about Rupert? <br/>Any of the Villains that sit here and want to show that here and want to show  that they're the top. they're the top. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. Parvati, you have the immunity necklace. <br/>Keeping it. <br/>Probst: You cannot vote for Parvati, and although there's been very little  talk of the hidden immunity idol, tonight is the last night you can play it  if you have it. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Colby, you're up. Colby, you're up. <br/>I'll write your name again, and if I'm up there in the final three, you'll  still give me the million[1]still  give me the million[1]dollar  vote. dollar vote. <br/>Now I wrote your  Now I wrote your name down, too. name down, too. <br/>Probst: I'll go  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol...  Should I let you finish? <br/>Probst: No need. <br/>I wasn't gonna play the idol, but because I got mixed feelings here this Tribal  Council, I would hate to go home with the idol in my bra. home with the idol in my bra. Give me just a second, Jeff. Give me just a second, Jeff. <br/>Did you know? <br/>Did you know? <br/>No, I had no idea. <br/>No, I had no idea. <br/>Probst: The rules of Survivorstate if the hidden immunity idol is played, any  votes cast against that person will not count. The person with the next[1]highest  number of votes will be sent home. This is, indeed, a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Sandra will not count. will not count. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote... First vote... Rupert. Rupert. Sandra. Sandra. Does not count. Does not count. Rupert. Rupert. That's two votes Rupert. That's two votes Rupert. Sandra. Does not count. Does not count. Two votes Rupert. Two votes Rupert. 15th person voted out and the seventh member of our jury: Rupert. That's three, that's enough. That's three, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Rupert, the tribe has spoken. Rupert, the tribe has spoken. Rupert, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. Congratulations. You've made it to the final final five. Over the next three days, you'll compete in your final immunity challenges,  and one of the five of you-- Colby, Jerri, Russell, Parvati, Sandra-- will be  declared the winner of Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on a special two-hour season finale...  I've been your girl this whole time. <br/>Parvati, you are lying. <br/>Probst: ...the war between the Heroes and the Villains will finally come to  an end. <br/>I'm the one in control. <br/>Send me home? <br/>That's the idea. <br/>Probst: Which will win-- good...  I don't know how to quit. <br/>Probst: ...or evil. <br/>Probst: ...or evil. <br/>Every man for his self now. <br/>Every man for his self now. <br/>Maybe I am not destined to win Survivor. I thought I had this one, but I'm proud of the way I played the game. I walk out of this game knowing I might not be as tough as I was six years  ago, but I'm still pretty darn tough. In this game, I don't need to win Survivorto know that I'm win Survivorto  know that I'm a winner.
