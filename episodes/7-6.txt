<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously, on Survivor: Morgan, never able  to catch their own fish...  These make it better. <br/>Nicely done! <br/>Probst: ...enjoyed the skills of Rupert, their temporary  tribe mate. <br/>Probably the smartest thing this tribe ever did was get ahold  of Rupert. <br/>Probst: At Drake, with Rupert away from camp, his loyalty  was questioned. <br/>I'm afraid he's giving away too much information about us  and not realizing it. <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge, with Rupert still on  board, Morgan claimed victory. Morgan wins reward! Rupert then returned to Drake, where he was greeted with open  arms. We welcome back this guy. Morgan returned to camp in high spirits-- with rain ponchos, a  cooking pot, and a chance to get clean. At the immunity challenge, Rupert arrived with a new  friend...  This is Balboa. <br/>Probst: ...and Darrah kept the seafood smoothie down,  leading Morgan to their third straight win. Before Tribal Council, Michelle made a last-minute plea to stay  on the island. I can't trust Shawn further than I could throw him. <br/>Probst: But it wasn't enough, and at Drake's second Tribal  Council, they voted Michelle out of the Pearl Islands. Michelle, the tribe has spoken. 11 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? [theme song playing] Who will be voted out tonight? [theme song playing] [thunder rumbles]  I thought Michelle left with a lot of class. <br/>She did. She's a very good girl. And it's too bad she's not on our tribe anymore. My first Tribal Council sucked. I was mad and I was tired. I was pissed off. I didn't want to be there. <br/>I tell you, Jeff was pretty direct with his questions  tonight, wasn't he? <br/>He was trying to get to the bottom of stuff. <br/>He didn't want to hear no sugarcoating, nothing. <br/>We were brutally honest this time. And I am sorry that I, I... if I offended anybody in any of my  answers. I hope I didn't. <br/>No. No. Not at all. <br/>Good. They still do not see that we gave Morgan some great momentum. They don't see that. I can't believe I wrote Michelle's name down instead of Shawn. Should have been Shawn. [sighs] For awhile, everybody knew a Drake was going to win  this. Now, there is question. You all right, Balboa? Now, there is question. You all right, Balboa? Oh, you feel awful cold. You're not... You didn't make it through the night, buddy. [sighs] This morning, I went and checked on Balboa. He was dead. So sorry, buddy. It's a hard world. <br/>How's Balboa doing? <br/>He's dead. <br/>Is he really? <br/>They want to use him for bait, so I'm burying him. <br/>He died last night? <br/>Yeah, he's gone. <br/>That's so sad. <br/>Rupert was a little upset. You know, he gets really attached to funny little things and the  snake was one of them. I don't know why he's so worried about a little snake he found  in the water, but, you know, who knows? That's Rupert. [squawking] [squawking] [squawking] [squawking]  [squawking]  Hey, hey, hey. You don't need to be doing that. Oh, you want to challenge me? [chuckles] Come on. [squawks] He's trying to get our flag. Move it. Hey, buddy. You're out of here. <br/>There's a pelican that just came by camp, and Ryno has a  soft spot for animals, which is great. So, Ryno starts petting it, making it feel good, and he's just  trying to help it out. So, it was pretty funny. Did you give her a name yet? <br/>His name's Pelican Pete. He's our mascot for a little while. [squawks]  Your friend is waiting outside for you. <br/>Oh, yeah, here he comes. <br/>He's really coming and following you. [laughing] Osten's going to be highly upset. You want to come in? Come on. [laughing] Osten, don't do that! Be nice. Just see what he does. He's not going to get up here. <br/>Why would you want this thing in here? I'm being dead serious. I'm, like, I would get the machete and chop this thing's head  right the ... off. I'm not playing around. [squawking] I'm going to get the machete right now. I'm not playing around. <br/>He wants to sit on your lap. <br/>I am not kidding. [laughing] Here he comes. [laughing]  I think it's hilarious that Osten is scared of every  little thing. I mean, he's such a big guy, you would think that, you know, he  wouldn't be scared of anything, but, you know, he's scared of every little  bug. <br/>Come on, buddy. Let's go. Let's go. You're not welcome. Come on. <br/>I don't like animals. I been bit by a couple animals, and the next animal that bites  me will die. I have no problem chopping that thing's head straight off. Just go sit down and stop ... with your blade. You don't need to do that. Not chopping anything's ... head off unless we're going to eat  it. We're not eating this one. Come on, buddy. Come on. <br/>Ryno's just trying to help out a poor old pelican and  O.T.'s just being an ass. There's no other way to look at it. He's just being an ass, sharpening machete. That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen. In fact, I was embarrassed by that. <br/>Sit down, though. I don't... I don't need you to irritate me right now. I believe Osten was afraid of it. He was, he was pissing me off. I mean, if you're afraid of the jungle and you're afraid of the  sea and you're afraid of birds... You know what? Don't even come out here. [squawks] All right, Pete. I'll see you later, buddy. <br/>If we have a free day today, I'm gonna gather logs and  we're tearing our floor apart and getting it six inches, eight inches off the  ground. <br/>Rupert felt that if we could elevate the bamboo off the  ground, even a few inches, that that would stop the biting at night. <br/>We want to keep away from the sand as high as we can. <br/>Even though most of us did not understand or agree that  this was going to help anything, we would do anything to stop the biting. <br/>I really think that just to raise it an inch or two with  bamboo is almost a waste of energy and time. We might as well wait till tomorrow. <br/>All the ... off, we're doing it today. <br/>Damn straight. <br/>So, everybody starts taking the shelter apart and what  happened? Shawn told Jon, "Well, I think this is all a waste of time. "I don't think we should be wasting our energy doing all of  this."  I just don't think it's going to make much of a difference  to raise it this much. 'Cause that bamboo is like... two inches high, not even. <br/>Shawn kept looking for excuses why not to help and Jon's,  like, had it up to here with him. <br/>Rupe, you don't think we could just slide, like, lift up  sections and slide the logs under? <br/>Jon. Stop. Where you going, Jon? <br/>I know, but I'm getting tired just watching everyone just  watching. <br/>Yeah, but, you know, you're making, uh, ten times more  work. <br/>No we're not! We're doing... It's ten times more work to talk about it for a  .... hour. I'll have all these out by the time everyone's ... done just  looking at it. <br/>Jon, honestly, relax, bro. <br/>Damn it, dude! You do more not to do work than doing work! <br/>What are you talking about, Jon? Relax. We're working here. <br/>No, you're just, you're not--  Are we on a time basis? <br/>I could give a ...! Dude, don't tell me to... Just do it and I will relax! <br/>Jon, chill your ... head, all right? <br/>Oh, my God. You're ... ridiculous, dude. Don't even go there. <br/>I just asked you to just pull those out. <br/>Just shut up! Just shut up, okay? Shut up. How about that one? Try that one. <br/>I'll ... shut up the day you start ... working. <br/>You know what, Jon, just shut up, all right?! <br/>God! You still can't do it! <br/>Just shut up. <br/>I'll ... walk away just for you to ... do it! <br/>Walk away. <br/>I will! <br/>Good. Ridiculous. <br/>No, what's ... ridiculous is not doing anything! That's ... ridiculous! <br/>You see us here, Jon? Relax! Okay? <br/>I'm glad Jon put him in his place. And after that, what happened? Shawn practically put the whole shelter together. Maybe Shawn should get a clue that he's not anybody's buddy  here. That he needs to get whatever has to happen done. He needs to make sure we win the challenge... or he's going  home. And that's it. <br/>Sea mail. And that's it. <br/>Sea mail. <br/>That's a cool pouch. <br/>A cannonball. <br/>What's it say? <br/>"Batten down the hatches, it's time to have a blast. Ready, aim, fire! Who'll be standing last? Will your tribe fall short or will you go too far? Your stomach will thank you. It's the tastiest reward by far."  Food, baby! [cheering]  You know, I think we're feeling vulnerable going into this  next challenge. We really want to get our momentum back. And we've lost three challenges in a row. Today's a new day, we're a strong tribe. We're totally united. All we have to do is get our strategy back for the next two  challenges, and just kick ass and just make it happen. <br/>I know. We're going to go kick some Morgan ass. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Take a spot on your mat. Morgan, getting your first look at the new Drake tribe. Michelle voted out at the last Tribal Council. Drake now down to six members. Numbers are evening up. You guys ready for today's reward challenge? Let's get to it. For today's challenge, in classic pirate style you will fire a  cannon. One tribe member at a time will come up, you will load the  cannon, you will aim the cannon, and, using fire, you will light the cannon. Your goal: knock out one of the other tribe's targets. First tribe to knock out all four targets wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, hell yeah. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: First part of today's reward... is a grill,  utensils. Make it a little easier, anyway. Put this over your fire, put your fish or whatever meat you  have. And I'm sure the fish is starting to get a little bland, so, a  few spices. Got some chili pepper, got some parsley, salt and pepper, little  bit of everything. Should, if you know what you're doing, spice it up a little bit. And if you're getting tired of fish... nice big lobster. <br/>Oh, lobster. That's exactly what I said. <br/>Probst: And if you're just tired of seafood altogether...  here's a little steak. [gasps and laughter]  Probst: In addition, Morgan, should you win, second piece  to your buried treasure. Also, the winning tribe gets to loot one item from the losing  tribe. Give you a minute for strategy. Wait for my "Go." Here we go, guys. First two up: Jon and Savage. First tribe to knock out the other tribe's four targets wins  surf n' turf. Savage gets loaded. Jon gets loaded. Now, the critical phase: aiming the cannon. You have ropes you can use. You also can tilt or lower. Andrew likes his already. <br/>What do you think? <br/>I think that's it. <br/>Probst: All right, Savage, which one are you going for? <br/>Front right. <br/>Probst: Front right. Get your fire. Morgan's first shot. Ready? Fire. [tribe groans] Wow! <br/>Probst: A little high and had a little English on it. Drake's first shot, Jon the guinea pig. Which one? Going for the orange one. Here we go. Ready? Fire. [groaning] Close. Next two, come on up. Ryno, it's loaded. Sandra going to load in. Ryno, get your fire. Ready? Fire. Boom, he connects. Morgan on the board with one. Sandra, get your fire. Ready? Fire. Ooh, nicely done! We're 1-1. Next two, come on down. T. gets loaded up. Grab your fire. Ready? Fire. [groans]  Probst: Too high. Ready? Fire. [cheering]  Whoo! <br/>Wasn't the one I was aiming for, but...  Probst: Drake takes the lead, 2-1. Next two, come on down. Osten and Rupert squaring off once again. Ready? Fire. <br/>Yes! <br/>Good job. <br/>Probst: And he does. Rupert, grab your fire. Ready? Fire. He nails it! Next two, come on down. Drake, one target away from surf n' turf. Darrah gets loaded. Shawn gets loaded. All right, Darrah. Grab your fire. Ready? Fire. [cheering]  Probst: And Darrah connects. We're tied up 3-3. Shawn can win it with this. Ready? Fire. [groaning]  Just a tad over. <br/>Probst: A little low and to the right. Next two, come on down. Savage and Christa. Here's where things stand: We're tied at 3-3. Morgan will shoot first. You connect, you have all four. Drake still gets their last shot. Savage tweaking. A lot at stake on these two shots. Christa eyeballing. Both tribes happy? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Andrew... Ready? Fire. <br/>Yes! <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: A miss. [Drake clapping] Christa, if you hit the one remaining target:  surf and turf is going home with Drake. Ready? Fire. [cheering]  Probst: And she does! Drake wins reward! <br/>Drake! Drake! Drake! <br/>Probst: Drake! Beef, lobster, spices. You guys will take this home with you. Tomorrow morning, you'll be sending somebody over to Morgan to  loot one item. Enjoy-- bon apetit. [cheering]  Oh, look at these steaks, man! <br/>Probst: Morgan. Grab your tribe flag and head on back to camp. [Drake cheering]  Surf and turf. Steak and lobster and spices! <br/>Look at these little fellas right here. And they ain't little. Look at our spices... Rosemary. Garlic sauce. Wait, wait. <br/>The piece de resistance:  Beef. We got beef. <br/>I mean, it was just like a dream come true. And when we came back here, everyone seasoned up their own meat  and made their own steaks and it was unbelievable. I think the lobsters are done. For sure. <br/>God, they look so good, Shawn. Oh, my God. <br/>It felt good coming home with all that stuff. We tore it up. We cooked the lobster first. <br/>Oh, man! That's cooked perfectly. <br/>I can't believe after all this, we still got steak, guys. <br/>Then, came around to the steak. <br/>This is so good, you guys. <br/>And I just picked it up off the grill and I just ate it  off the fork. It was so delicious. It was the greatest steak I've ever had. This is the bomb. <br/>You're going to have to get up in a few minutes and go  loot. Okay? <br/>Okay. I'll get up. <br/>You want to wake up. <br/>I'm about to go lootin' and takin' some of that old  pirate's booty. I'm going to have fun today. Their morale is pretty low as a result of losing the reward  challenge. Uh, so, I... I plan on taking that morale and jumping on it,  just up and down so it's absolutely nothing come immunity time. That's the goal. <br/>Who's that? <br/>Jon. <br/>Is it? <br/>It's too early for me. [laughs]  He's an irritant. And he's rude. <br/>Okay, T, unclench your fists. [laughs]  What's up, Big Jon? What's up? <br/>Little Jon from Drake came to our camp to raid it. He was a lot more humble than he usually is. He looked like he put his diplomat hat on, remembered some of  his people skills and he... he wasn't as cocky or as arrogant. So what are your thoughts today, Big Jon? Everyone voted we have to take your pot, uh, as a strategic  move, in case you come after our pot. <br/>I thought you were coming after the shower. <br/>Nah. I... you know what? I would love to wash my hair before I go. <br/>Then Little Jon indicated nothing would make him happier  than to have some shampoo to wash his hair. Gave him some shampoo, a diplomatic gesture on our part. <br/>Awesome. Have you guys noticed I've been a little nicer at challenges? <br/>We don't mind talking smack, but it hurts when you lose  six straight challenges. <br/>Oh. <br/>If we were winning those challenges, talking smack doesn't  bother me. It just...  Well, technically, seven. We threw the seventh one just to get Burton out. Like, I mean, did you notice that I... I moved my guys out of  the way? But, anyway... I'll be right back. <br/>Throwing the challenge, him. <br/>Seven is what he said. <br/>Him. <br/>Who said that? <br/>He said he... they threw the challenge for that piece...  chess piece, as if they weren't trying. <br/>Yeah, right. <br/>The whole time. <br/>He screwed up, majorly. <br/>He claims he threw the Chess-Checker Water Challenge. I think that's just nonsense and I think it's bad sportsmanship  for him, little bastard, to indicate that we didn't fair and square win that  challenge. So, I don't think they did throw it. But just for that little pissant to take that away from us, it's  ridiculous. <br/>Bye, guys. <br/>Bye. <br/>You know, he came here to ruffle some feathers and he  definitely did. Hey, say "hey" to Rupert for us. <br/>I will. <br/>And it concerned me from an immunity standpoint, because  the most critical one coming up today, that he's causing dissension among the  ranks. And let the games begin. Let's take the gloves off and let's see what they're made of. Let's have some fun. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! What's going on, Rupert? <br/>[ laughs ]: Play time. <br/>Probst: What's up, T? <br/>Hey. <br/>Probst: Christa, getting more bug bites. <br/>I don't know what happened to me last night. I guess I just have some new freckles that have developed. It's cool. <br/>Probst: All right, first things first. Immunity... back up for grabs. Okay, today's immunity challenge will require strategy and  endurance. Three tribe members from each tribe will have a wooden pole  across their shoulders. Each round, weight will be added to those poles until you cannot  take it any longer. That's the endurance portion. But the decision of which tribe member gets the weight added to  their shoulders will be made by only two members from the opposing tribe. That's the strategy. Once you can't hold the weight any longer, drop the pole, you're  out of the game. Last person left standing wins immunity for their tribe. Drake, because you have one extra member, you're sitting  somebody out. Sandra's sitting out. All right. Wait for my "Go." All right, guys. We'll be working in 20-pound increments. Each bag weighs ten pounds. You'll put two bags on each person. Drake, where you putting your first 20 pounds? <br/>Osten. <br/>Probst: Morgan, where you putting your first 20? <br/>Rupert. <br/>Probst: Rupert. All right. Grab your bags. Put them on. Let them go. Next 20 pounds. Morgan, where's it going? <br/>Rupert. <br/>Osten. <br/>Probst: Where's the next 20 going-- Morgan? <br/>Rupert. <br/>Probst: Savage. All right. Drake dividing it up a little. Rupert going to take another 20 and Savage getting his first 20. Morgan, who's your next 20? <br/>Rupert. <br/>Probst: Rupert. <br/>Savage. <br/>Probst: Savage. Remember, you have a limited amount of weight, 600 pounds, to  allocate. Rupert at 80 pounds, Osten at 40 pounds, Savage at 40 pounds. Morgan? <br/>Rupert. <br/>Probst: Rupert again. <br/>Osten. <br/>Probst: Osten. Now it looks like we're going with the same strategy on both  tribes. Rupert's at 140 pounds, Osten's at a hundred pounds, Savage at  40. Osten, how you feeling? <br/>All right. <br/>Probst: Let's put some more weight on. <br/>I hate doing this, Rupe. [exhales]  Probst: Once again, Rupert and Osten showing down. [growls]  It ain't lasting. <br/>Keep it up, Osten. You got it. <br/>You got it, Osten. <br/>Probst: Rupert at 200 pounds now. Making a risky move by taking his hands off that bar. <br/>He's in pain, too, Rupert. <br/>Keep focus, Osten. <br/>You looking good, Rupert. <br/>He's trembling. <br/>Probst: Osten at 160, plus that bar is another 15, plus  the pain you feel in the back of your neck. Both men struggling. It's going to come down to will. <br/>He's done! <br/>He's out. <br/>Probst: And like that, Osten is out. <br/>Stay in, Rupe. <br/>Probst: Take a seat, Osten. <br/>It's all right, Osten. [groans]  Probst: Put some more weight. <br/>Rupert. <br/>Probst: Rupert. <br/>Savage. <br/>Probst: Savage. [grunts]  Probst: Rupert has lost his pole. <br/>All right, good job, Rupe. Good job. <br/>Probst: The strategy worked for both tribes, heavy up on  the strongest guy. Both strong guys are out. Have a seat on your crate, Rupe. All right, let's give somebody else some weight. <br/>Savage. <br/>Savage. <br/>Shawn. <br/>Probst: Drake going to heavy up on Savage. Morgan spreading the weight around. That's going to start getting heavy. That's a lot of weight and an uncomfortable bar on the back of  your neck. <br/>Got to break one of them. <br/>O.T. was saying Shawn first. <br/>Probst: Let's add some weight. <br/>Shawn. <br/>Savage. <br/>We're breaking him right here. <br/>Probst: Let's add some weight. <br/>Shawn. <br/>Ryno. <br/>Probst: Ryno finally in the game with 20 pounds. Shawn's carrying 120, Savage still holding strong at 160. [indistinct encouragement]  Hang in there, Shawn. <br/>Probst: Shawn now at 140, still 20 pounds less than  Savage. <br/>Give him some more. <br/>No, don't need to-- Ryno. <br/>He's going to break. <br/>He's done. <br/>Probst: Savage has somehow managed to hang in for a long  time at 160 pounds. <br/>You got it, Shawn. This contest was made for you. <br/>Probst: And with that, Shawn is out at 140 pounds. Savage, still holding strong at 160, a weight he has been at  twice as long as anybody else. <br/>Come on, Morgan! <br/>Probst: Let's add some weight. It is down to Christa versus two strong Morgan guys. <br/>Hang in there, Christa. <br/>Probst: Very impressive. Christa now at the same weight Osten dropped out at, 160. Same weight Andrew's been at for 15 minutes. Ryno at 140. This is where you have to fight through the pain or give in. <br/>It's just too much on the human body. <br/>Probst: Let's add some weight. <br/>Savage. <br/>Probst: Drake changing up. Trish doesn't like the decision. Big strategic move and it was one that was not agreed on. <br/>She's going to fall. Right here. Right here, she's falling. <br/>Stay in there. Stay in there. <br/>Probst: Got to fight through it. She can't do it. Morgan wins immunity! <br/>It's okay, mama. <br/>You did your best. You had 160 pounds. <br/>Probst: Morgan, it's going back home with you again. You should give that to Savage. Well earned. <br/>Give it a kiss. <br/>Probst: You got tears in your eyes-- you all right? Feel good? [Andrew sniffles] Drake, I know you weren't planning on going to  Tribal Council, but you are. Somebody's going home and, after tonight, we'll be even:  five-five. You have this afternoon to think about that vote. Head on back to camp. <br/>I should have stood up there longer, guys. That's all I got to say. We wouldn't have this problem. <br/>Everybody did as much as they could. <br/>That was the worst, pitifulest-ass performance I've ever  seen. He deserves to go home, if nothing else, for that. I am very irritated with Shawn. I want him off my island and out of my adventure. We may just go fishing. <br/>All I know is one person has a hell of a lot of power  right now. <br/>Yep. <br/>It's not right. I mean, just so much power. <br/>Yep. <br/>It's like, he could pretty much do whatever he wants to,  frankly, and we're all sort of following along. <br/>Jon and Trish feel insecure about Rupert's power within  the tribe, because Rupert is the man in charge here. <br/>You know, I love Rupe, but there's something that is just  not feeling right to me about this whole thing. <br/>Agreed. <br/>You know, if anybody could jump to Morgan and survive, it  would be Rupert. With us, he could go all the way, and with them, he could go all  the way. I mean, what do you guys think? I-I-I don't... you know...  Christa won't go for it. <br/>Well, we don't have... we don't need Christa. <br/>We're not telling her. <br/>We're not telling. <br/>We're not telling Christa. All we need... all we need is, uh, us three and Shawn. Shawn will say yes in a heartbeat. <br/>What do you think? <br/>What are the ramifications if we do? <br/>Food. <br/>For a million dollars, can you starve for 19 days? <br/>Yes. <br/>So it's a done deal? <br/>I guess so. It has to be. It's the smartest way we can play this game right now. <br/>The more we talked about it and the more we fleshed it  out, the better I felt, the better Jon felt, and the better Sandra felt. Jon didn't want to tell Christa, because we don't need her vote. Shawn-- we're going to tell him at the last minute that his neck  has been saved. This is the biggest shock of all-- that we have all come to this  conclusion on Rupert. Tonight, it's going to be a really big surprise. Rupert's going to be the one gone and not Shawn. <br/>Oh, man, this is crazy now. First it was Shawn. Now we're down to Rupert. <br/>Rupert would never do us wrong. I trust him. <br/>I'd rather keep the tribe strong just a little while  longer. <br/>Rupert. <br/>Huh? <br/>They're planning on getting rid of you tonight. They're not going to go with Shawn. They've changed. Jon and Trish-- they want you out. <br/>I can't believe that Jon and Trish are trying to get me  out before even the merge. We do not even know when the merge is going to be, and they're  trying to get me out. Jon and Trish are going to come try and sway you and get them...  you to vote me. That's still only going to be three votes. <br/>Right. <br/>And it'll be a tie. <br/>Right. <br/>Three against three. <br/>So I should say yes. <br/>You write Trish down. <br/>Say yes to voting you...  Say yes to voting me. <br/>And then write Trish. <br/>Then write Trish down, and Trish is out fo-four to two. <br/>And then you and I are going to take this one home? <br/>Hell yeah. <br/>I'm with you on that, baby. <br/>I was pretty upset because I thought I was going home. Then I talked to Rupert, and he found out that the plot wasn't  to get me off tonight, but to get him off. And he came running back here to say, "It's you and me. Let's get rid of Trish. She's the bad apple." So we'll see. Wait, who's taking a ride? Rupe? Rupert? <br/>Yep. <br/>Where'd that come from? <br/>Had to do something. There's no way anyone can go against Rupert to the final two. It'd be a landslide. It'd be a freakin' K. O., man. You got to do what you got to do. <br/>That is for sure. In this game, you have to do what you got to do. <br/>Exactly, so I trust you more than any of them, so...  If you don't do what you got to do in this game, somebody  could take you for a ride. <br/>Yep. Everyone's really ready to vote off Shawn, but Shawn's a good  ally for me. Rupert? Uh, good guy, but I'm not signing my million dollar check to  him, so that's the way the game's played. <br/>Remember I said, "You look out for my back, I'll look  out for yours"? That's what we're doing. Little do they know what's really going to happen. I think everyone is going to be very shocked. Everyone. [chuckles]  Probst: Well, judging by how confident you guys act at  challenges and seeing that today's immunity challenge was physical, I know  you were not expecting to be here again tonight. Sandra? <br/>Definitely not. We were on full tummies. Our motivation was up there. We were like, "There's no way. "They're dying "of hunger. "They don't have it together. There's no way we can get beat. No way."  Probst: Let's talk about today's challenge. Christa, you outlasted a lot of people, including Morgan's  strongest guy, Osten. You had as much weight as he did when he dropped out. <br/>The challenge was hard. I... didn't think that I actually could pull that much weight,  but, uh, I did. And it sucked to drop it, though. <br/>Probst: Rupert... I'd be lying if I didn't say you looked  incredibly sad. Your eyes are sunken. Your smile is gone. <br/>'Cause I'm ready to cry. <br/>Probst: What's that? <br/>I'm ready to cry. <br/>Probst: Why? <br/>We shouldn't be here. <br/>Probst: So are you upset about losing? Are you upset about where the tribe is? <br/>I'm upset the way the tribe has gone. We started out so strong, and now we are not. And it's hard to pull everybody together. <br/>Probst: Are you losing hope that that can happen? You can't lose hope. You got to believe that you can. We'll lose one person tonight. I hope it's not me. And maybe then, we'll try and build a stronger Drake tribe. <br/>Probst: Why would it be you tonight? <br/>I think my tribe sees me now as unneeded. They have gotten it in their heads-- even though I'm trying  desperately to make them believe there is no certainties of a merge, there is  no certainties of anything in this game-- that if I make it to the end, they  can't beat me. Uh, if I make it to the merge, I'll win a lot of the immunities;  they can't beat me. Doesn't give a damn if I catch them ten pounds of fish a day. I know at least half my tribe wants me gone. <br/>Probst: Trish, when you hear a guy like this, who's been a  strong member of your tribe, feel like half the tribe has turned on him, what  are your thoughts? <br/>I'm surprised to hear him say that, to tell you the truth. I didn't know he felt that way at all. So, to hear him talk like that, you know, it's-it's, um... sad  to me. I had no idea that that's the way he felt. <br/>Probst: Is it hard for you to vote somebody out tonight? <br/>Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. It's really hard for me to vote somebody out tonight. <br/>Probst: Sandra, how sure are you that it's not you  tonight? <br/>Oh, I know it ain't me. [laughing] The person that's going home today is the one that  least expects it. It's the person that in the past couple of days has been giving  so many different stories that we don't know what the heck to believe. This person will be missed, but, for the good of the tribe, this  person has got to go home. [laughter]  Probst: With that, it is time to vote. Christa, you're up. <br/>[whispering]: You stabbed us all in the back. You have no idea how to play this game, but good try. See you later. <br/>Everybody's got a price, everybody's got to pay, 'cause a  million dollar man always gets his way. <br/>I've always said you were a snake from day one. Um, you can't be trusted, so, um, good-bye, adios. <br/>Rupert, I'm voting you out because I think you just have  too much power with the other tribe, and it just seems to me that you are  straddling both tribes. <br/>I cannot believe that you turned on me so quickly. Everybody in my tribe tells me that you want me out, and you lie  right to my face. I can't take that. <br/>You know what? Game's over for you. It's my game now, so good-bye. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote-- Trish. Rupert. Trish. That's two votes Trish, one vote Rupert. Rupert. Two votes Rupert, two votes Trish. Three votes Trish. The sixth person voted out of the Pearl Islands-- Trish. You need to bring me your torch. Trish, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Well, the one thing that came out of tonight's Tribal Council is  that there are very few things that are certain in this game. One thing that is certain-- this tribe has been to Tribal  Council three times in a row. You are now down to five members, same as the Morgan tribe. 21 days left. It is anybody's game. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Stay tuned for scenes from our Head back to camp. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor...  Who the hell voted for me? <br/>I did. <br/>You ... me! Jonny Fairplay is Jonny Pain-in-the-ass now to me. <br/>Probst: At Morgan...  O.T., this morning, he checked out. I could see in his eyes, he's throwing in the towel again. <br/>Probst: And Morgan and Drake are in for a big twist. Your past has come back to haunt you. <br/>I didn't see this coming at all, obviously. But I always knew that anything can happen. And so, I really never took anything for granted. Hats off to the Drake Tribe. I think you guys are all great. I hope one of the Drakes end up winning the million dollars. Good for you guys, you kept a secret, and that's the beauty of  this game-- you just never know what's going to happen and when it's going to  happen.
