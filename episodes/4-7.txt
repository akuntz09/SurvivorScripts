<br/>Probst: Previously on Survivor:John made an alliance with the other three original Rotu members and took control of the tribe. <br/>Everyone knows I'm the leader. Everyone knows it's my plan. <br/>Probst: But Rob and Sean were left out of the alliance and have their own plans for John. <br/>If I have any opportunity at all to get rid of John, I will. <br/>Probst: Rob and John decided to make a pitch and join John's alliance. <br/>I'm giving you my word, 100%. <br/>Probst: They cut a deal. In case of a merge they'll vote together to eliminate Maraamu first. <br/>I want them to trust me, but he shouldn't. <br/>Probst: Go! Rob then led Rotu to victory in the immunity challenge, Rotu wins! <br/>PROBST ...sending Maraamu to Tribal Council, where they voted Gina out of the tribe. The tribe has spoken. Ten survivors remain. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>It's a skull of a man! <br/>Oh, that's definitely a skull. <br/>What is that? Is that the eyeball socket? <br/>Yeah. That's the eye socket. <br/>Oh! <br/>This is unbelievable. <br/>It really is. <br/>It's hard to believe how many centuries we're looking at right here. <br/>Look, that's his ribcage. Do we agree that's a paepae? <br/>It is a paepae because these rocks are too evenly formed. A paepae is a Marquesan monument. That's where they had their ceremonies and where they even performed cannibalism. <br/>They just buried them in the side of a wall? <br/>Look at how this skull is fractured. <br/>Yeah, that's what I was talking about. <br/>It's obvious it had some blunt trauma to the head. A fracture all the way across here. <br/>I think it was an emotional day. Last night, it was tough. Tough vote. I was happy at one point that the vote went my way, but when I saw Gina leave, I felt really bad. <br/>Go over here, back under... Paschal and Neleh, I don't think I can break up that situation. They have a really great bond. Because we're at three right now, I have to work it. It'll be tough. I think if we do get to another vote, they'll vote me off. <br/>You're thinking of catching a piglet. I'm thinking of catching a pig. I mean there are a bunch of pigs running around. There's one right there. <br/>This tribe is a bunch of morons. I've just about had it with this tribe. <br/>Hello. <br/>How are you? Good morning. <br/>Doing great. <br/>Vecepia is just so fake to me. The way people are acting, it drives me crazy. Maybe that's their game. Everybody is going to be happy to each other, but I hate it. I think at the other camp I always had an ace in the hole, and over here I don't. <br/>The only thing is we don't know if they're keeping their word. Say, like, they get rid of Kathy like they said the first time, but then say just as a precaution they might get rid of one of us. Just so we can't do an alliance. I've been stuck in a roadblock situation for the past ten days, and I haven't been able to get around it. And it's like I've tried going up one side of the mountain and I've tried going up the other side, and maybe it's time to try to just dig a hole right through it. <br/>Mail call. Okay, ladies! <br/>No, you. <br/>Yeah, go right ahead. Oh, it's a long one. <br/>It's a long one. "You'll be left in stitches if you sew up this reward. Give this map to one survivor. Defeat can you not afford. Choose your one wisely with long sleeves and long pants. Don't send the wrong tribe mate. This may be your last chance." One of us has to leave. <br/>There's a map here. We've got five minutes to pick one person, get them outfitted in long-sleeved pants, tennis shoes, and have them start following this map. Okay, who do we want to send? <br/>I'll volunteer. I'll go do it. <br/>Is there anybody else that wants to go do this one? <br/>Okay, that's fine. <br/>I've got five minutes? <br/>Less than that now. Put on long pants. <br/>I'm going to do it for us. Rotu, come on. <br/>All right, man, Rotu, Rotu. <br/>I got my pack. I'll take some mango. Thank you. Give me the map. <br/>Be careful! <br/>I will. <br/>Where's the knife? Give me a knife. <br/>You going to want socks also? <br/>Might as well, right? <br/>We're all counting on you, babe. Put some coconut in your pocket. Come on, boy. <br/>Now it's in God's hands. <br/>Yeah, I volunteered because I thought there may be a change and something might be getting shaken up. But that's how I've been playing this game. I've been taking chances. <br/>Probst: Hey, guys. I've been taking chances. <br/>Probst: Hey, guys. Hey. <br/>Probst: How you doing, man? Kathy, how are you? <br/>Good to see you. <br/>Probst: Welcome to Kamuihei. This area in particular is called a tohua, which is a public meeting place, so anything important that would happen in tribal life would happen right here. You will now serve as ambassadors to a very important event in your world, the merging of your two tribes. Rotu, Maraamu, no more. Tonight, the new tribe will be born under your guidance. You will sleep under the stars on the same paepae where rival chiefs would meet 500 years ago to discuss and make decisions. By morning, you will have made several important decisions, among them creating the new tribes' name, and painting the new tribal flag. Now because this is a very big responsibility, we want you guys to be well fed, so you're thinking very clearly. So if you guys will have a seat, I will go get your food. <br/>We got a lot to talk about. <br/>Yeah, man. <br/>Probst: Tell me this is not going to be a fun night. <br/>Oh, my God, yes! <br/>Probst: A little more to come. <br/>Thank you! <br/>Probst: Now what would pizza be without beer! <br/>All right! <br/>Oh, my God. Jeff sat us down to pizza and 30 Coors Light. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Cheers. <br/>I was siting across from this young buck, and I'm going, "I'm going to pound beers and eat pizza with this guy?" I've heard a lot about you. <br/>I've heard a lot about you. [laughing] So we have to come up with a name. <br/>Bernie's tribe. <br/>That's original. <br/>I was just on a total high. I knew that by responding to this challenge I was taking a chance, and it paid off. Pizza and beer! <br/>I feel so bad. My tribe people would love pizza. <br/>I feel bad, too. <br/>You do not. <br/>That's too bad for them. <br/>We started talking immediately about what's happening with the tribes. Zoe and I were like the moms. You know, we were cleaning up. We were getting the tribe going. <br/>Really. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>You and Zoe feel you're pretty close? <br/>Zoe and I were like moms. "Let's clean the place up." Unreal. That's unreal. The lies going on. Honestly, you feel you're close, you and Zoe? <br/>Zoe? <br/>Yeah. Unreal. Zoe is funny because I confronted Zoe. She told me that she was voting you off, right, and then I go to John, I said, "John, who's next?," and he said, "Kathy." She doesn't know if I'm telling the truth or lying, just like I don't know, just like nobody in this game knows who's telling the truth. <br/>After talking to Gina, I thought he was just a lazy kid. Young, didn't care. I'm having a hard time with it. <br/>What exactly did Gina say about me that made me out to be such a bad person that they want to vote me off so bad now? <br/>You're a lazy bum and you don't care about anything. <br/>Really? <br/>She thinks you were two-faced and you were mean. <br/>Really. That's unreal. <br/>You're telling me Zoe is voting me off. Zoe and I bonded, so you think that's not a shock to my system? <br/>Let me tell you something. I'm sitting here talking to you right now, Kathy. I may be writing my own destiny up here. If they find out that I said anything, then they're going to take me out and you'll be second. Unless we're going to change that. You want to make a pact, me and you? <br/>Do you want to? <br/>They'll never know. It will be just me and you. <br/>I felt this pact we were going to form was okay, but it happened so quickly, and he wanted it so badly, I just sort of shook hands. All right. <br/>All right. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Serious. <br/>All right, I am really serious. Don't stab me. <br/>You don't have to ask me twice. I swear to God, I will never vote you off. I promise. John thinks I have an alliance with the team. Now she thinks I have an alliance with her. Dude, I've been lying this whole game. John thinks he's going to ride it all the way to the end. I'm being serious. <br/>No, I'm totally agreeing with you. I just can't get over how conniving it is. <br/>Who is John, some kind of Marquesan god? [laughing] Have another beer. <br/>I'm a little hesitant on why he just suddenly decided to make me on as his soulmate or whatever it is. It was so quick. And I just don't trust that element of it. We're going to sleep well, under mosquito netting, my God. Does that mean that we can sleep without pants on? Don't panic. <br/>You're crazy. We can't talk about anything that's going on. I basically saw another Sarah in her for me. Warm me up, baby. Want to massage me, baby? It's going to be interesting because if I actually do stand by my word and go with Kathy, it's a new game. Will you remember in the morning that we made an agreement? <br/>We made an agreement, buddy. <br/>Then in the end it'll be me and you. <br/>That will be a riot. Let's see if we can do it. <br/>Rob and I promised each other Let's see if we can do it. <br/>Rob and I promised each other not to tell anybody that we discussed the tribal issues. We just were going to tell both the Rotu members and Maraamu that the conversation was about the new tribe name, the flag, getting to know each other. <br/>Don't panic. Don't be nervous. <br/>We came back to Maraamu. <br/>Hi, guys! <br/>And we had to inform Paschal and Neleh that we had to get everything out of the camp onto a raft in five minutes. We got five minutes! Everything we got, come on. Everything we got. Everything! Get the kettles. Get the knives, Neleh! <br/>Put everything on top. Water jugs, Pappy. Kathy, help me get it on top here. <br/>We got it. We got it. Keep going. Keep going. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Okay, that's it. Grapefruits coming down. <br/>One minute! One minute! [panting] Everybody back to the raft. Now, Paschal! Touch the raft. Good job, guys. <br/>Good job, buddy. Nice to meet you. <br/>Yeah, you too, buddy. Rob. Pascal. Neleh. <br/>Oh, my God, we did it. <br/>With only four of us we did it. We're a team. All of us. No, there's a merge. <br/>Oh, really. <br/>We have so much to talk about. <br/>Here you go, man. <br/>So this is our new buff? [coughing] This is it. [cheers] Good job, guys. Unbelievable. <br/>You know, upon arriving to the new tribe, it was great to see everyone, but I definitely entered with hesitancy. <br/>You're the only person I didn't give a hug. <br/>I know. Hi, Tam. Good, I'm tired. But it's good to see you. <br/>You guys also. <br/>And I was aloof and trying to figure it all out after hearing what Boston Rob told me about these people wanting to vote me off. <br/>Great seeing you. <br/>I was disappointed, too, that the loyalty's shot. It's gone. <br/>So how you doing, Zoe? <br/>What's that? <br/>How you doing? <br/>Doing better now that you guys are here. Here, I'll put this up in a tree. I think we got most of it. I was aloof to Zoe, worried that she actually was going to vote me off. I didn't trust her. I didn't trust John. I didn't trust Tammy. I didn't trust the General. I didn't trust anybody when I got back here, really. I was very, very, aloof and somewhat quiet, just sort of hanging on the outer rim. <br/>All right. So these are the new buffs and the new flags. <br/>What's the new name, guys? <br/>Yeah, what's the new name? <br/>The new name, we had like a half-hour to make this, this morning, so. The name of it is Soliantu. <br/>Soliantu. <br/>And the name means... Sacred allegiance to the sun. <br/>That's cool, guys. Yeah! <br/>Everybody hold hands. Soliantu! <br/>Ready? One, two, three. Soliantu! <br/>Let's just get it out of the way right now. <br/>Rob and Kathy together developed our new name, Soliantu, and our new flag. We got our new buffs, pink buffs. The women were very happy about it. You know, I don't care what they say. Real men don't wear pink. <br/>What was that? <br/>I said real men wear pink. <br/>Okay, Rob. <br/>Well, when we finally got the ramp and the supplies on shore, everybody just like busy little beavers went right to doing what they had to do. <br/>Reposition. There we go. <br/>We were just so happy to be back together again. It was like old times. <br/>So we got a harvest here, Dear Lord, in the name of Jesus, with new tribe members, new colors and a new life. We thank you, Lord, in the name of Jesus that everyone got here safely, keep our spirits high, for we know not what's going to happen tomorrow. We give you all the honor, glory and praise, today and forevermore, for Solianu. Soliantu? Solianu. <br/>Soliantu. <br/>Soliantu. One, two, three, Soliantu. <br/>The game faces are on in full tilt and nobody wants to talk about it. Weird. Nobody wants to talk to me about it. I think the game has changed in the sense that the Rotu loyalty has dissolved or it has taken on new shape. And there is definitely some undercurrent alliance that's been formed while we were over at Maraamu. But in my heart I just can't get over that this Rotu tribe wanted to vote me off. <br/>I'm about ready to get axed. <br/>Eh. <br/>No, I'm serious. I believe it. So I don't know what to do. Powerful people on this beach, if you ask me. They're playing us, just so you know. They're playing you and Neleh too, and I just want you to understand that. <br/>Oh, I understand that completely. <br/>Yeah. I think it's time to find out how we all are playing out in these people's minds. Not just sit and wait to get voted off. <br/>Well, when we first landed, Kathy, I think she may have been advised by Rob either on the way over here or sometime shortly after we got here, that she was being looked at very closely as a possible first elimination, and she was really upset about it. I just told Kathy, I said look, you know, I'll listen and maybe there's an opportunity that we'll find ourselves in, and if I do, I'll let you know. I just didn't want her to get in a confrontational mode this early on after reuniting. <br/>By God, it's a game. But I don't think lying fits into games. So just tell me the truth, man, and keep it upfront because I just can't deal with lying. And integrity is critical in this game, I feel. So I really appreciate it. <br/>Those little white ball things-- I don't know what those are called. <br/>A couple people said that you absolutely should not lie to play this game. Let's, you know, start something new. Let's tell everybody before they're going to get voted out and let's not lie, ever. And you know what, that is just great, up here. But it's not realistic. <br/>I don't want any bugs crawling in my ears. Same here. <br/>This is a game about being the smartest person, outwitting, outplaying and outlasting everybody else, and you may have to tell a white lie along the way or two or three. But I went into this game knowing that I was going to do what it takes to win the game. I hope when all is said and done that these people still look at me and still like me. I don't intend to lie to any of their faces, but I do intend to play the game and win it. <br/>What's up? Should we have a little talk? <br/>Sure. <br/>I wanted to talk to you two privately. Sure. <br/>Branch down here to sit on. <br/>I want to talk about a couple things. <br/>Oh... I'm just curious. Who you guys voting for? <br/>I haven't figured my vote. <br/>I don't think it's any of your business, first of all. <br/>I find you amazing, Zoe. <br/>Excuse me? <br/>I find you amazing. <br/>Why thank you. <br/>I trust you, and everybody is lying, left and right. <br/>You know what it is, it's all about tribal loyalty. There's still a ghost of Rotu, and that's what the problem is. <br/>Right, but that wasn't the way it was supposed to be, was it, Zoe? I mean, I thought we had an agreement, Zoe, you know? You and I and John and Tammy and Sean, and Vecepia and Rob. <br/>Agreement about? <br/>Didn't we have an agreement about taking everybody from their side of the island off? You don't remember anything about that? <br/>No. <br/>See, this is what I mean. Unbelievable. And Kathy wasn't your first choice as soon as she got here, and we promised that if we got rid of Gabe that we'd stay together? <br/>How did you ever get that? <br/>How do I ever get that? Unbelievable. Tell the truth, go on, will you? Tell the truth. Don't worry, everybody. I'm telling everybody tonight, Zoe, everybody. The other day, didn't you tell me you were voting for Kathy, yes or no? <br/>No, I didn't. <br/>No, you didn't? You paused and you lied. I can't say that I didn't see it coming. It was like a certain degree of trust that I felt, among the group. And it completely got shattered. Where you going? You leaving, Kathy? <br/>Yeah, for crying out loud, I get a story from you and then I get a story from Zoe and people are lying through their teeth, and I haven't lied once, man. I don't know what this stupid game is about, but I'm out of here. <br/>You can believe what you want to believe, okay. <br/>I don't like to be lied to, and then again and again and again. It irritates me. <br/>Zoe is lying to me. They're all lying to me. They're all lying to me, and I'm being played as a pawn. A pawn. I need the immunity because I'm getting the ax. I don't know. It's just not adding up, but I'm going to trust what Rob told me, and I need immunity to stay in the game. <br/>Probst: First things first. As always, Edgar is coming back. Let me say, congratulations on making the merge. The good news is you now have a one in ten shot of being the sole survivor. Now because we are an individual immunity, the idol is no more. This is what you covet. Since you're now competing against one another, you have a chance to win individual immunity. Win it, you alone are safe from the vote. To win it, you're going to have to have some good sea legs for our immunity challenge today. Each tribe member will stand on a platform in the water. The person to stand the longest without falling off wins. Only your feet may touch the platform. Any other body part touches the platform, you're out. You've randomly drawn numbers for which platform you'll stand on. Take your spot on your platform. Wait for my go. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Probst: Immunity at stake. Survivors ready? <br/>Ready. <br/>Probst: Go! Challenge is on! Neleh, you touched the platform. Neleh and General are down. Neleh, General, take a spot on the shoreline. Paschal is down. <br/>Watch out. There you go! Bye-bye! <br/>Probst: V. is down. Going to do the backstroke to the beach. Zoe, you look very comfortable out there. <br/>Nice recovery, John. out there. <br/>Nice recovery, John. Oh, baby. <br/>Come on, Johnny. <br/>Probst: Sorry, Sean, you touched. Down to five. Zoe, you're out. <br/>Oh. <br/>Hang in there, buddy. Hang in there. <br/>Whoa! Whoa! <br/>He touched it! <br/>Probst: Whoa, Rob. You're done. <br/>Told you about being a wise ass. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Steady foot, John! <br/>Go, Johnny, pots and pans. Baby! <br/>Probst: Tammy goes in head first. Take a spot on the shoreline. We are down to two. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: John and Kathy. For immunity. <br/>So many times he's like stumbled and he just stay there, man. And he hasn't touched once. He just stays up there. Kathy is holding in there. <br/>Kathy is pretty steady. Steady. <br/>Probst: Whoa. John. Kathy wins immunity. You lost your concentration, John. Kathy. <br/>What? <br/>Probst: You want this? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Come get it. <br/>All right, baby! [cheering] Well earned. Well earned. <br/>Probst: Turn around here. Here we go. <br/>Yes! <br/>It's terrible living over here with these people. They're all trying to merge into one like they're one big happy family. The way I see it now, Kathy probably blabbed to John, ratted me out. John's slick, but he's not as smart as he thinks he is. See the thing is, you can't have secrets too long in this game, especially in an individual situation like we're in now. But within the next two Tribal Councils, John is going to get exposed one way or another. I mean, that's the game. If you can figure out what buttons to push on what people, then you're going to have the advantage. <br/>Hey, what's up? Where you going tonight? <br/>I have no idea. <br/>I thought we were taking them out one at a time. <br/>There's lots of things we came up with. <br/>What happened about my word is my bond? <br/>Oh, yeah, mine was fine until you went right to Kathy and went right over at that other side and said, "They're going to vote you out first." I did not say that to Kathy. <br/>I'm not going to have this conversation. Don't lie to my face. <br/>There we go. Now it's on, man. Now it's personal. <br/>No, no. You know why it's personal because you're going to stand here and act like you didn't have that conversation. <br/>You're over here, Mr. I'm Not Lying. <br/>We had conversations. We looked each other in the eye, looked each other in the eye. And if it would have rested and it would have stayed still, then I would have been like fine with it. <br/>So why you didn't come to me man to man, then, John? <br/>Because at that point you betrayed me. <br/>How I betray you? <br/>This is too much drama. <br/>Obviously, it was a mutual agreement between everybody. Now this changed? <br/>Dude, how can it be a mutual agreement? Each person is an individual, they get to decide. <br/>Why wasn't the individual vote thrown in when it was Gabriel's turn to get voted out? It wasn't individual then. It was a [blip] alliance of seven, right? Don't hand me that individual's [blip] when Gabe's ass was time to get out because he didn't fit into your plan. So he had to go. Now we're talking about, well, everybody got their own vote. Everybody got their own vote. You all got a four thing going, you included us and said, "All right, we're going to go in seven." Everybody was like, "We team. We team." You flat out said... But I'm saying, don't tell me one thing and just because I think about something or just because I talk to somebody, then all of a sudden it's off. <br/>So wait a minute. What am I supposed to be? Like, naive? <br/>You're not playing both sides? <br/>I'm not playing both sides, Rob. <br/>It's all right, well, everything is coming out tonight, so don't worry. <br/>It's already out. What more do you want? It's already out. <br/>I hope you don't have any secrets. This here is getting clean. <br/>That's fine. I'm totally clean, too. I have no worries. <br/>Cool. <br/>Rob, you want to vote me out tonight, vote me out. But tell me man to man like Gabe did, okay? Okay, bud? Don't go to Kathy and say... I've been true to one person had this whole thing, me. I keep my word to me. <br/>I hear you. I hear you. I keep my word to myself, too. <br/>I've told nobody nothing, and that's the way it is. <br/>You haven't told anybody anything? <br/>I made no alliances to you. I made no alliances to nobody. I just keep my word to myself. <br/>That's what I'm saying. That's cool. <br/>I haven't talked to anybody. Nobody's talked to me. Fine, I'm happy. I do my own thing. <br/>That's fine. If you're telling the truth... I'm The General and that's that. <br/>Cool. <br/>It's tough because you're looking for angles. You're constantly looking for an angle to play. Maybe everybody is lying, you know. Who knows? <br/>Five years ago, I'd have been worse than Rob. I probably wanted to push John into that freaking fire. The reason I'm more upset because I've had personal one-on-ones with John and we've self-disclosed stuff. How it's like to be a black man, how it's like to be a gay man, what it's like to be isolated. We shared moments that got nothing to do with this game. And when we share those kind of moments, and then you come and try to pull some BS like this, it's really hurtful. <br/>What outfit should I wear tonight to Tribal Council? <br/>Now everybody is back to that love tribe, happy family thing, so I didn't expect it to be that way, but it is. God only knows how many people are real about it. It's flipping me out. <br/>Like I said, day one is completely different than day 21 or whatever. <br/>Let's go over it so I feel better. Okay, babe. Thank you. I just have to keep telling myself it's a game, and get into this peculiar act of kissy and love, and I love you, but guess what, when we go to the next Tribal Council, you're out. <br/>Probst: Welcome to Tribal Council. Congratulations on making it this far. Survive tonight, you are guaranteed a place in the jury and a chance to be the sole Survivor. Let's start at the top. V, is it a different mindset now that it's no longer two tribes facing off, but it is ten individuals? <br/>Most definitely. I think it is a different mindset because you're coming from competing as a group entity to competing one-on-one. So you're no longer looking at the other person as your teammate per se, but looking at each and every one of these as our adversary. I mean, they're all our great friends, but this is my adversary now. This is my adversary now, but we love each other very much. <br/>Probst: Sean, what's the mood of this tribe? <br/>I feel like the outsider, quite frankly, because it is an old reunion of old tribe members. I can't speak for Maraamu right now is a mixture of emotions, right now, because I'm fighting for my life individually, since I came over, I felt like. <br/>Probst: Zoe, how do you respond to Sean feeling like, you know what, I don't have a shot in hell right now, because you guys all have a pact and no matter what I do, no matter how I contribute, you'll never let me in the group? <br/>Well, I don't think that's necessarily the case. Everybody has their own feelings about, you know, how strong they feel within our family and our tribe. And if that's the way Sean feels, I feel sorry for him feeling that way, but if that's the way he feels, I don't see that. <br/>Probst: How about you, General? What's your point of view on how far you'll go in this game? <br/>I'll never do anything to compromise my values. You know, I am who I am, and I, you know, my word is my bond. I'm not a youngster. You know, my word is all I got. <br/>Probst: John, same for you? I think you've told me that, you know, I'm going to tell you the way it is. <br/>My personal rule is that, you know, if somebody wants to have a bond with me or whatever you want to call it, fine. Come talk to me, and if I agree to it, that's great. If you come to me and say one thing, and you agree to it, and then you immediately turn around and start adjusting it without telling me you're adjusting it, to me that's the same as lying. <br/>Probst: How about you, Rob? Are you happy with the way you played? <br/>I'm happy with the way I've play the game. <br/>Probst: Have you lied? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Anybody else here lied to you? <br/>Without a doubt people have lied to me. People that are sitting here telling you right now that they have not lied, they have lied. Those people know who they are. I don't feel it's necessary to one by one single them out, but I think people need to be able to look in the mirror at themselves after and if they're happy with the way they played the game, that's fair enough for me. <br/>Probst: All right. There's a new facet now to immunity, now that we've reached the individual stage, and it works like this. When you win immunity, you now own immunity, and you can assign that immunity to somebody else. So if you feel very secure, you can buy a favor, you can buy somebody's vote, you can protect somebody if you want simply by giving your immunity to them. Kathy, you didn't have the luxury of negotiating today. So I'll put you on the spot now. And are you secure enough now to give that immunity to somebody else? <br/>After what I went through today? I do not feel secure. Because I feel that there were some really strange things that happened today with deceit and lies that I'll talk to people about it and hopefully get it resolved, but I question the whole loyalty thing. It evaporated. So the immunity to me right now is important. <br/>Probst: It's time to vote. Kathy is the only one safe from the vote. Neleh, you're first. <br/>Boston Rob, I'm voting for Neleh, you're first. <br/>Boston Rob, I'm voting for you, boy. You tried to stir up a lot of stuff today. I knew from the beginning that you weren't going to keep your word. You attacked me personally, so I'm more than happy to put this in here for you. <br/>I vote for Johnny. You play the game real well. Hopefully, if things swing right, you'll be gone. If not we'll see you on the flip side. <br/>Yo, look here, man. I'm voting for you because you dissed me and my boy, and if I get voted out next, I really don't give a damn. But your time is coming. You definitely lied to us. That's for me and you, dawg. <br/>My vote tonight is for Rob That's for me and you, dawg. <br/>My vote tonight is for Rob Mariano. Brother, you know, we came into this tribe with not the right numbers, so we were kind of down. But I know soon I'll have to set up that debt for the Maraamu tribe and give you guys all pizza and beer. I'm looking forward to it. See you soon. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Rob. Rob. John. John. Three votes Rob, two votes John. Zoe. Four votes Rob, two votes John, one vote Zoe. Rob. That's five. Seventh person voted out of the tribe: Boston Rob. No need to read the last vote. Rob, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Probst: Well, you've made it Good luck, guys. <br/>Probst: Well, you've made it 21 days. You've reached the final nine, which means the fate of two of you rests in the hands of the others. And from what I heard tonight, should make for a very interesting final 18 days. You guys can head back to camp. See you tomorrow. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor: Kathy confronts Zoe about her lying ways. <br/>There was never any intention of voting you off. <br/>Zoe just lied to me point-blank. <br/>The Survivors reach new heights. Fly! Neleh gets upset with the actions of some of her tribe mates. <br/>I've been nothing but honest to everybody. I'm following my heart. There's got to be something changed here. <br/>I like people to know that this was a game, and I hope everybody doesn't take so much of everything that I said seriously. I was trying to be funny. It's just my personality. I definitely enjoyed the game. I like trying to manipulate more than anything else. I hope nobody comes away with any bad feelings afterwards. I hope we can all be friends.
