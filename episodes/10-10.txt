<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor:  This is the scariest thing and the hardest thing thing  that I'll ever do. <br/>Probst: The last Ulong member battled to survive alone. <br/>I feel like I'm going to starve to death. No, no, no. Man! It's tough. But if I win... it'll be worth it. <br/>Probst: As she reached her breaking point...  Oh, my God! Probst: ...Stephenie received some good news. <br/>It's a merge! I'm going to have friends! And food! <br/>Probst: She packed her things...  See you later, Ulong. <br/>Probst: ...and paddled out to join Koror. <br/>Oh, God, here she comes. <br/>Oh, my God...  Probst: Koror welcomed their new tribe mate with open  arms. But some had different ideas. <br/>As much as I'd like to have her around, I think she needs  to go really fast. <br/>Probst: Two Palauan fishermen arrive to teach the tribe  how to fish. <br/>Oh, yeah! <br/>Probst: And then they celebrated with an island feast. <br/>Where's Tom? Drinking from the bottle. [ woman gasps ]  Probst: And some celebrated more than others. [ gasps ]  You all right? <br/>Yeah, I'm good. <br/>Stephenie? <br/>Probst: The next day, Coby told Stephenie all of the  tribe's secrets and alliances...  Jennifer is your main bout right now. Because Jennifer is so jealous of you. <br/>Probst: ...irritating some of the other tribe members. <br/>It is so obvious what he's doing right now. Coby told Steph that Jenn wants to take her out, which isn't  good. <br/>You're not the dead man walking. <br/>Probst: Tom reassured Stephenie that their alliance from  day one was still solid. <br/>You have friends in this tribe who are going to keep you  alive. <br/>Donuts! <br/>Probst: At the first individual immunity challenge... 15  chocolate chip cookies. <br/>Oh, me, me. Probst: ...the tribe succumbed one-by-one to temptation...  ...leaving Tom as the last man standing. Tom wins the first individual immunity! [ cheering and applause ] At Tribal Council, Janu seemed ready  to go. <br/>I think it's me tonight. <br/>But it was Coby's loose lips... Tenth person voted out of  Survivor Palau... ...that cost him the game... Coby, the tribe has spoken. ...making him the first member of the jury. Eight are left. Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>What are we at, 25? <br/>25 it is. <br/>Last night, Coby got voted off, and I was taken by  surprise-- I had no words, I couldn't even say good-bye to him, I just...  felt... this huge loss. I was so taken aback, I felt betrayed. Nobody had informed me of anything. <br/>I'm sorry, are we at summer camp? We're on Survivor. This is not necessarily our true colors. We're playing a game. <br/>Exactly. <br/>What was that performance? <br/>I don't know. <br/>I know, like, her eyes and, like, I... seriously, the  smile looked like a jack-o'-lantern to me Janu is completely mad. She's crazy. She's a crazy person. Last night at Tribal Council, she was sitting like a  jack-in-the-box with this really creepy smile and eyes on her face. She was just so excited. <br/>She was excited. She thought she was going. <br/>It was scary. I don't like it at all. It freaked me out. It was like a clown. <br/>Katie started... she was gossiping about Janu. She was saying, "Ooh, Janu is giving looks. Janu is making faces." And... Janu overheard it. <br/>What are we, junior high, Katie? We pretend we're all good friends? It's-It's silly. Do you understand what I mean? I have nothing against you personally, 'cause I don't know you. <br/>I have nothing against you. <br/>But you're being...  You're being creepy. I'm sorry. <br/>Well, then why don't you tell me to my face? Why do you have to go to your little friends and tell them? That's what I don't understand. <br/>I'm sorry. I...  No, you don't have to be... you don't have to be sorry. <br/>I'm telling you that I am. <br/>That's who you are. <br/>I apologize. That wasn't fair. <br/>I'm not used to playing games. If I had something to say about you, I swear to God, I would  come up and say it to your face. Why do I have to go to...? "And she did this." 'Cause you're Saturday Night Live? 'Cause you're the comedian-to-be? <br/>She just talks in these circles and doesn't make any  sense, and then she's like, and, you know, "Katie, then you're making  fun of me," and she does the face again, which is even more scary when  she's impersonating herself being impersonated. <br/>I am very upset. <br/>Okay, I apologized, Janu. So if you can't get over that, then that's...  It doesn't matter if I can or not. You're done. You're done with the conversation. <br/>I-I just don't want it to turn into, like, you know...  you're off in a corner, because...  It's going to turn into whatever it's going to turn into,  'cause all you guys are going to turn on each other. It's fine. <br/>Janu is turning it into just something that we need to  kind of put up with out here. It's kind of a buzz kill to have her around. It's unfortunate, but... what are you going to do? I'm not going to vote someone out because I don't like them. I can get over it. She plays a bigger role in all of our strategies, where  Stephenie only threatens it. Some may think that Stephenie deserves to stay around, but in  the grand scheme of things, winning this game is hardly about deserving. I don't care if someone deserves to be here or not. If you have a role in my strategy, then you deserve to be here  so you can help me win so you can help me win a million dollars. a million dollars. <br/>Probst: Ready for today's reward challenge? <br/>Mm-hmm. Yes. <br/>Probst: Okay, for today's challenge, you are going to  build a tower in the water. Here's how it will work: We will randomly divide into two tribes  of four. Using a buoy for assistance, you will transport the six pieces  of scaffolding one at a time into the water, and construct your tower. Once you've built the tower and it's secure, one tribe member  will climb to the top, grab the small flag, and race back to the beach. First tribe of four to get back to the map with their flag wins  reward. Want to know what you're playing for? [ Survivors murmuring ] The winning foursome will leave here and  take part in a Palauan feast. [ chuckling ] You'll be met by the high chief of this area at a  bai, which, in case you're wondering, is a traditional meeting house where  chiefs get together to work out tribal politics. You will drink local beer, you will also have food and dessert. Make sense? <br/>Yes. <br/>Oh, yeah! <br/>Probst: All right. We will randomly divide into two tribes and we'll get going. All right, the tribes are Steph, Ian, Katie and Jenn taking on  Gregg, Tom, Janu and Caryn. Here we go, for reward. Survivors, ready... Survivors, ready... Go! Go! Dead even heading out with the first piece of scaffolding and  finding out it is not as easy as it looks. Those pieces weigh 30 pounds each. <br/>Over here, it's over here. <br/>Probst: Tom and Gregg going down for their tribe. Janu and Caryn sitting this out, letting Gregg and Tom do the  work. Ian, Jenn, Steph, and Katie all working together. A lot easier with four people than it is with two. <br/>My side's on. <br/>Mine's not on. Caryn and Janu still sitting this out, letting Gregg and Tom do  the work for their tribe, while all four members of the other tribe are  working together. Those pieces are going to need to line up exactly before they  will fit together. will fit together. Janu goes out to help. Janu goes out to help. Tom, Janu, Caryn and Gregg have their first piece of scaffolding  in. They're heading back for their next. Ian, Jenn, Katie, Steph has their first piece in. They're heading back, trailing. Tom and Gregg, Janu and Caryn coming back with their second  piece of scaffolding. <br/>Let's go! <br/>Probst: Ian, Steph, Jenn, Katie coming back with their  second piece of scaffolding. Janu and Caryn resting again with the platform. Now Janu heading out to help, just as Ian, Jenn, Katie, Steph  start to assemble their second piece. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Tom, Gregg, Caryn, Janu have their second piece of  scaffolding. They're heading back. <br/>One, two, three. Ian, Jenn, Katie, Steph has their second piece in. Heading back, trying to make up some time. Four pieces left. <br/>Let's go! Come on! Run, run! [ indistinct shouting ]  Probst: Katie really slowing down her tribe. <br/>We've still got it. <br/>Push with me, go in front. <br/>Probst: Tom, Janu, Gregg and Caryn with their third piece  of scaffolding. <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>Grab the...  Grab the thing. <br/>Katie, pull. <br/>Katie, help us! <br/>Katie, pull this! <br/>Probst: Everybody wants to eat. Big feast. <br/>The other way. <br/>The other way. <br/>Gregg trying to get that last corner on. They have their third piece, heading back to shore for another  one. Ian, Steph, Jenn, Katie working together. They have it-- They have it-- they're heading back in! they're heading back in! <br/>Here! Let go...  Probst: Janu starting to struggle, trying to get to the  platform to hold on. Janu gets a second wind, she goes back underwater again. Gregg getting into a position where they can hand him that  fourth piece of scaffolding. Ian's group making up some time. Gregg and Tom are lined up. Janu is lined up. They have their fourth piece of scaffolding. Steph, Ian, Jenn, Katie have their fourth piece in, and they're  heading back. They have two pieces left now. <br/>Everyone, let's get it. <br/>Probst: You can only move as quickly as your slowest  member. Tom, Gregg, Janu and Caryn are worn out. <br/>Guys, only... couple of yards-- you got it. <br/>But they still manage to get that fifth piece. Ian and Steph not quitting. <br/>Pick it up! Push it over. Come on, Steph! <br/>Probst: Tom, Gregg, Caryn, Janu have one piece left. Katie has hers. Heading back for their last piece. You guys are still in this. Tom, Caryn, Gregg, Janu, coming back with their final piece of  scaffolding. Tom and Gregg, Janu and Caryn starting to wear down. Steph, Ian, Jenn, Katie not quitting. Gregg, Tom, Janu, Caryn with their final piece of scaffolding. Once they have the cap on, they'll grab the flag, heading back  to the beach. Jenn, Steph, and Ian doing all the work. Katie's worn out. Tom, Janu, Gregg have the final piece on. Janu's going to climb to the top. [ grunts ] Janu unclipping her flag. Now it's a race Now it's a race back to the beach. back to the beach. Janu is back. She's waiting on the rest of her tribe. Janu, Tom, Caryn, Gregg... win reward! Palauan feast! [ cheering and gasping ] [ cheering and gasping ]  That was good. <br/>That was good. <br/>Probst: Ian, Jenn, Katie, Steph... great effort... just  not enough. So I got nothing for you. Head on back to camp. You guys ready to eat? <br/>Yeah, let's do it. <br/>Probst: Get your stuff. <br/>Probst: Get your stuff. Head on out. Head on out. <br/>Hello. <br/>Hello! <br/>Welcome! [ speaks native language ]  We've been in Palau now, um, for weeks and weeks, and  really have seen nothing but the wilderness of Palau. [ singing in native language ] This was my opportunity to meet  the people. It's so good to be here. <br/>Please accept our little gift. To be respected by them and then to return that respect. It's just another gift that I bring home. <br/>It's a privilege, an honor to present you our little gift. <br/>Thank you so very much. I've never been in the presence of a real chief. He gave me a beautiful headpiece with flowers and he blessed me. I was very, very moved. [ women singing in native language ]  We were just very thankful for the opportunity to step  outside of life on the island here and experience what is life in Palau  really like. really like. [ singing in native language ] [ singing in native language  ]  Oh, wow. <br/>Beautiful. <br/>We sat down at a little table very low to the ground with  pillows on which they just started a procession of epicurean delights. Oh, my gosh. <br/>What's that, chicken? <br/>Chicken or turkey or something. Oh, my gosh! Barbecue. <br/>Oh, my goodness. <br/>Corn on the cob, guys. There was no talking game strategy, planning, we left all of the  game and strategy at the door. and strategy at the door. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I think I'm going to make myself sick. Halfway through the meal, I had to get up and excuse myself. I thought I was going to have I thought I was going to have an  embolism. an embolism. [ retching ]  Yup, she is. <br/>Thank you. <br/>You know, it's kind of disappointing, you get this big  meal in you and we're all enjoying it and want to... want to take down as  much as possible, and, you know, there's four other people that would have  enjoyed it a ton, but unfortunately, Janu just couldn't handle the entire  thing. the entire thing. [ burping ] [ burping ]  Hey. <br/>Hey. Can we tell you a dinner story? <br/>Yeah, I want to hear all about it. Well, I'll tell you what we got. They rolled out, I mean, we had a fish. It was a regular salad. <br/>What kind of dressing? <br/>Squeezed lime on it. What else? <br/>Barbecued ribs. <br/>Barbecued ribs? <br/>Chicken. <br/>Chicken, corn. <br/>Corn?! <br/>We didn't even talk about if we had brought back any food. We knew they were assuming that we didn't bring back any food,  and Gregg says, "Okay, don't finish your stew. Don't eat another bite." Don't, uh... don't fill yourselves  up too much. Don't full yourselves up too much. <br/>Why? <br/>'Cause we brought some back for you. <br/>No, you didn't. <br/>You did not! [ screaming, laughing ]  What is that? <br/>You'll have to wait for that. <br/>They're like, little donut holes. <br/>They're like a sponge cake. <br/>Oh. <br/>Oh, yummy. <br/>What is it? <br/>Mostly chicken. <br/>It's meat and stuff. <br/>It's grub, grub. <br/>Here's chicken. <br/>Oh, my God. You guys, you are the best. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you so much. <br/>You're welcome. Happy Thanksgiving. <br/>I love it. <br/>Whatever that is, it's the best. <br/>I know. <br/>The yellow...? <br/>Go for it. <br/>You guys didn't have this? <br/>We just came back from this feast, and Janu says,  "Oh, I want to try just one more," and reaches out and takes some  of the food. <br/>It came out in this, like...  I thought it was interesting that Janu decided to say,  "Oh, you know, I didn't get to try that." 'Cause she was vomiting  or whatever, and she stuck her hands in there, and ate our dessert. Actually, Caryn did it, too. But, you know, what are we going to say? "Get your hands off something that you brought us?"  something that you brought us?" I don't think so. I don't think so. <br/>What's it look like, anything? <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. <br/>What's an "Oh, my God?"  Look at that. <br/>Oh, boy. <br/>Oh! "Feeling claustrophobic? Are you prone to worry? Panic during this one, you could be the next to join the  jury." [ gasps ] What is this? <br/>Oh, man this is like...  It's a cage underwater. <br/>...get out of the cage kind of-- underwater? <br/>Underwater? You have to put it underwater right away? <br/>I bet you... I'll bet you. "Feeling claustrophobic?" Oh, yeah, underwater. <br/>I definitely need immunity, because apparently I'm the  "strongest" girl, and I'm just as much of a threat as any of the  guys. But we'll see, I mean, I'm doing the best I can out here, and I  just hope that I can get immunity. that I can get immunity. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Probst: First things first. Tom. Immunity is back up for grabs. Today's immunity challenge is going to test your ability to  remain calm and not panic when everything else in your body says otherwise. You all take a spot in the water, underneath a grated steel  barrier. As the tide begins to rise, the water will rise, and your  breathing room will slowly decrease until you run out of breathing room. The person who stays in this challenge the longest wins  immunity, guaranteed a one-in-seven shot at a million bucks and the title of  sole survivor. One more thing: Today's challenge also reveals how you handle  fear. The first person to bail on this challenge will face the  ultimate test of fear: You'll be taken to a new beach and abandoned there  tonight and abandoned there tonight to live on your own. to live on your own. You'll have flint and steel, you'll have a machete, you'll have  a jerry can full of water, and you'll have some fishing gear. So if you've learned anything in your first 26 days out here,  you should be fine. If not, it's going to be a miserable night. Make sense? Take a spot out in the water. Take a spot out in the water. We'll get started. We'll get started. <br/>Here we go. Survivors ready? Survivors ready? Begin. Begin. <br/>This man walks into a bar. [ laughs ]  He's got a bar in one hand and a bar in the other. [ laughter ]  Probst: First person out, leaving here on a boat, taken to  an island, abandoned...  I'm thinking of stepping out just to get away from this  crowd for a night, Jeff. [ laughter ]  That'd be great. <br/>A little vacation from the tribe. <br/>Get away from the rats for a night. <br/>That's right. <br/>Probst: Jenn, think you'd be all right on your own? <br/>I think it'd be kind of tough, actually. <br/>Probst: How about you, Janu? <br/>I would try my best. I don't, I'm already getting cold in here, so I don't know how  long... What's gonna be worse? <br/>Probst: Which would be worse, hanging in that water cold  or being left alone tonight? <br/>Probably hanging in this water cold right now. <br/>Probst: Are you starting to panic a little? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Just like that, Janu's out. Janu's out. [ laughter ] [ laughter ] What just happened, Janu? Was it me saying Was it me saying the word "panic"? the word "panic"? Janu... how are you at fire? <br/>Uh, I don't know. I'll find out tonight. <br/>Probst: Have you made fire yet? <br/>Um, no. [ laughter ]  Probst: Katie, glad it's her  Probst: Katie, glad it's her and not you? and not you? and not you? [ laughter ] [ laughter ] [ laughter ]  Probst: Doesn't seem like a lot of love lost with these  guys. They don't seem too concerned about you tonight. <br/>That's not true. <br/>Not true at all. <br/>That is not true, Jeff. <br/>Not true at all. <br/>Probst: You know what? I'm sitting here asking her if she knows how to make fire, and  you guys are making jokes like you're at open mic. You tell me, You tell me, what am I supposed to think? what am I supposed to think? Water starting to rise. Soon, you will run out of room completely. This challenge has been going for about 40 minutes. This is where mind over matter This is where mind over matter  comes into play. comes into play. The water's completely covering everybody's ears. Now it's starting to creep up toward the mouth and the eyes. Caryn opts out of the competition. We are down to six. Water really creeping up toward the mouth and eyes now. Jenn almost underwater. Steph partially underwater. Ian struggling. Pushing his face through that grate. Jenn is underwater. Will she come back up? Katie's out of the competition. Jenn still underwater. Steph goes underwater. Both remaining women are running out of breathing room. Ian goes underwater. Jenn and Steph still underwater. Ian's back up. Jenn is out of the competition. Steph is out of the competition. We are down to three-- Tom, Gregg and Ian. All five women are out of the competition. Immunity at stake. Water coming in over the eyes, into the mouth. Gregg goes underwater. Gregg is out of the competition. <br/>Good job, Gregg. <br/>Probst: Tom trying to create a hand snorkel. Ian plugging his nose. <br/>I can't believe they're still up like that. <br/>Probst: Immunity at stake,  Probst: Immunity at stake, safety at Tribal Council. safety at Tribal Council. That's it! Tom wins immunity! [ applause ]  Good job, Tom. <br/>Good job, Tom. <br/>Was it me? <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: Okay, some business to take care of. First of all, Janu, we're gonna bring your boat in. You will be taken to a deserted island. You'll be left on your own with the materials you have. <br/>Be well, Janu. We'll see you tomorrow. <br/>Good luck, Janu. <br/>Good luck, Janu. <br/>Janu, good luck. <br/>Janu, good luck. <br/>Probst: Tom... immunity-- come over and get it. Once again, you are safe from the vote at tomorrow night's  Tribal Council. For the rest of you, including Janu, somebody else is going to  be voted out of this game; you'll become the second member of the jury. member of the jury. Swim on back to your boat. Swim on back to your boat. <br/>Right now, I am going to a different island, all by  myself, because I couldn't finish out because I couldn't finish out the  immunity challenge. the immunity challenge. I don't think that I'll be scared as long as I have fire. I think if I am going to be in the dark, then I think I'll get a  little bit more scared. This is very hard, and it's very frustrating, but I don't want  to give up. I just feel very inadequate, 'cause I see the fire come up and  then... it goes away. And I try to put little And I try to put little pieces... and  it's not working. pieces... and it's not working. Ow! This is a challenge for me, but I needed time away from that  camp. I'm not getting along well with anybody. I feel very much on my own, I feel very much on my own, and...  it is me against them. and... it is me against them. Woo! I've got fire. Yesterday, I didn't even want to be here, but maybe God was just  telling me, hold on a little bit more because this is the feeling you are  supposed to get. So who knows? Every day brings new experiences, and right now, I am probably  the happiest that I have been in these 26 days, 'cause it's all about me and  this little island. It's mine. It's mine. It's all mine. It's all mine. The moon, the stars, the water... and my fire. and my fire. It's all mine! It's all mine! <br/>The big decision that we're facing right now is who's  going home tonight? <br/>Who we, uh...  Who we, uh... Who we thinking today? Who we thinking today? And my thought with that is that that's like an emotional  response because they get along with Stephenie, and Stephenie has the ability  to form some inside bonds early. No one's going to do that with Janu, and so I know I could  convince Jenn that Stephenie's the one. <br/>From day two, Katie, Ian, myself and Stephenie had all  decided that we'd try to run this as a final four, and we all agreed that  should we get split into different tribes, every man for himself, but look  out for each other when we do get back together. The problem with that right now is Jenn and Gregg, who have  since joined Ian, Katie, and I, and have become five, are adamant that  Stephenie goes home. So at what point do we stop rewarding Janu with, um...  We're the only ones here, right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Right. I still struggle with the question of why, why not now, if then,  you know? I mean, then why for the same exact reason why wouldn't...? <br/>Well, I think Stephenie is a bigger threat than Janu. <br/>And there's no way that Janu squeaks by in the end? <br/>If she wants... I mean, she wants to go home so  bad...  Well... we know they have to go. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>That's true. I'd-I'd get concerned about the whole eleven Tribal Councils in  a row, and Stephenie is still surviving. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I just feel like it's a story developing that we need to  put an end to. Stephenie is a physical threat. She's a competitor. She's got a strong will. She wants to win this game. There's other folks, like Janu, who don't want to win this game  as much as her. Stephenie's story has been continuing and continuing, so you can  just see it all coming together. Stephenie conquers Ulong, then comes in and conquers Koror, and  we want to all prevent that from happening. <br/>I love her to death. I'm really going to miss her. But...  Right. <br/>Better now, than she getting too comfortable. <br/>Yeah. <br/>As things seem now within the tribe, Stephenie appears to  be going home tonight. So, it's not... where my heart is, where my heart is, but  anything can happen. but anything can happen. <br/>How you doing? <br/>Hey! How was it? <br/>Did she say it was great? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yeah, she said...  Tell us about it. Um... It took me about two and a half hours to make a fire. <br/>You got it? <br/>You got fire? <br/>You got fire. <br/>Good for you! <br/>Good job. <br/>Three hours. <br/>You did it. You did it. <br/>Do you feel better? <br/>You seem like you feel better? <br/>Better? Um... Yeah. It was, uh... full-circle for me. It was... it was great to be away from here, and it was great to  be on my own. And I just had time to be by myself, and that was good. <br/>Wow. That's amazing. <br/>Good job. <br/>Good for you. &gt; Congratulations. <br/>Well done. Well done. <br/>To be honest, I didn't want to come back here, and when I  got here, everybody was like, "Oh, that's great. Hey, good job. Way to go." The same people that were being rude and saying  that I created animosity. created animosity. Just... not... nice. Just... not... nice. <br/>I mean, we all agreed that it was Janu tonight, and Janu  wants it to be her, but for some reason I have a feeling it's me. Today, there was never a time when I could grab anybody alone  and walk down the beach. <br/>We'll see. <br/>Yeah, that's the plan. Who-- you? <br/>It almost seems like no one wants to talk about it, wants  to talk about it, so I'm really nervous. so I'm really nervous. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the first member of the jury. Coby, voted out at the Coby, voted out at the last Tribal  Council. last Tribal Council. Janu, let's talk about your night alone. You were abandoned on a separate island with meager supplies. <br/>Yup. <br/>Probst: How'd you do? <br/>I did great. I, um, finally got the fire going, and then, um, did a little  dance. It was really exciting. <br/>Probst: Yeah, that... That had to be a-a big  accomplishment for you. <br/>It was a very big accomplishment, and I tried to put  myself to sleep, and in the morning, the sun rose, and it was a whole new  day. It was great. <br/>Probst: As you left in your boat, everybody waved and said  good luck. Did you buy it? <br/>Um, honestly, Jeff, it-it was, um... No. I'm sure that half of it was sincere, but the other half was, as  they call it, the game. And when I came home today from the island, it... it just felt  really strange. It felt like I didn't belong. <br/>Probst: Caryn, you look like you're counting to ten over  there. I'm just shocked. You know, if that's the way she chooses to take it,  that's-that's... that's in Janu's head. <br/>Probst: Tom, at this point in the game, is it worth versus  threat-- who deserves to stay in this game, versus who can't I beat? <br/>Yeah, well, it's all gamesmanship now. Nobody is voting based on, uh, who they like or who makes me  laugh. The game is on, and people are basing their votes on how it  positions them in the game. And eliminating competition is part of this game. <br/>Probst: Gregg, same question. <br/>It's... it's not a question of worthiness, and I think  threat, you know? Everyone that wants to win the $1 million here is a threat to  me. I mean, you definitely want someone in the game who is not going  to really try than you would someone who is giving five million percent. And some plans have been established, and some people may be  threats within those plans. Unfortunately, you know, Survivorisn't always about fairness and  who deserves what. <br/>Probst: Katie, why keep you? <br/>Why keep me? <br/>Probst: Yeah. <br/>Well, I don't pose any threat at this point. Especially as far as challenges go. <br/>Probst: Janu, why keep you? <br/>No reason. They can get rid of me. <br/>Probst: There's no reason they should keep you? <br/>No, because, I mean, I have to be honest. I had a really rocky road so, if I was them, God, I'd be sick of  myself already. <br/>Probst: You almost seem like you want to go home. <br/>It doesn't matter, Jeff. Whatever happens, happens. I'm... I'm completely satisfied. <br/>Probst: Is there a part of you that wants to say  "Vote me out"? <br/>Yes. Absolutely. But I don't know what they'll do. <br/>Probst: Ian, why keep somebody who's saying, "I want  out of this game. I'm not going back to camp"? <br/>Well, if you feel like you don't want to continue in this  game-- if you feel like, you know, you want to set your torch down-- then you  have the power to do that. You have the ability and the power to set your torch down at any  time, and there's nobody keeping you here. <br/>Probst: Stephenie, if looks could kill, Janu would be on  the ground. <br/>It's just... it's just... it's nothing against Janu. This... It... it kills me. I can't even... Someone who I feel, like, could care less if  they're even here. [ crying ] And here I am, like... I'd kill to be here. <br/>Yeah, but... what you need to understand from my point is  that I already received what I needed to receive from this whole experience. <br/>And you're fine with that. <br/>Yes. <br/>You could care less if you leave right now, right? <br/>Yes. That's... that's correct. <br/>I care. I... I'm not done playing this game and, like, if someone asked  me to vote them out, see ya, because you don't deserve to be here. [ sniffles ] And I'm...  Probst: So you feel you're on the hot seat tonight? <br/>I know I am. It's just... it's not that. It just... it kills me that someone who wants to basically go  home that bad, these people will keep around just because... I don't know  why. I guess I showed too much heart and too much will. <br/>Probst: Tom, in your profession, unity, camaraderie-- big  part of it. When you hear somebody like that laying it out, and you have  somebody next to them who's saying, "Please get rid of me," is  there a dilemma for you? <br/>There is a dilemma. Um... Stephenie would fit into a 108 truck in a moment, and, uh,  everybody in the company would be proud to work with her. And it's... it's not work, and it's not camaraderie. It's Survivor. So there's a huge difference here. <br/>Probst: Janu, if you had your way, what would happen  tonight? <br/>I would ask the tribe to vote me out and keep Stephenie  in. <br/>Probst: What's the difference between you laying your  torch down, and you looking to this group and saying, "Vote me  out"? <br/>I guess, after reflecting, and, um, understanding this,  there would be no difference. So I would be willing to lay down my torch so that Stephenie can  have a chance to stay in the game. <br/>Not just for me. If she wants to lay down her torch and she wants to quit this  game, she can do it, but... not on my account. <br/>Do you want me to rephrase it? What I am saying is, I will lay down my torch, and I don't want  Stephenie to feel that I am doing it for her. That's something that I have to do. <br/>Probst: I just want to be clear. You are, on your own, quitting this game? <br/>Yes, Jeff. I will lay down my torch this evening. <br/>Probst: Well, I don't know if it's appropriate. We have rain coming down. Maybe this is your final epiphany or cleansing moment. I see that you brought all your belongings. Go ahead and gather them, Go ahead and gather them, bring your  torch over. bring your torch over. Janu, per your wishes, this game is over for you, but you will  not go home. You'll return and be a part of our jury. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Good night. <br/>Probst: Good night. Another strange turn of events at Tribal Council. Steph, you've hung in there for a long time, overcome a lot of  odds. You escaped another one tonight. Sounds like you have your work cut out for you. Grab your torches, guys. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:  Tom might have to be the next to go. <br/>Probst: Stephenie steps up her game. <br/>I'll do it, if you guys are game. <br/>Probst: And one of the men could take the fall. <br/>We didn't vote Stephenie out when we should have, which is  the first round. You want to think I'm a threat? I'll show you I'll show you how threatening I am. how threatening I am. <br/>I asked them to please let me go home, and it didn't work,  so I made the last move, and I decided to take myself out of the game. I guess I did make a major power play, and I guess I did ruin  their plans. Even though I laid down my torch, no one will ever be able to  take away this most unforgettable experience. unforgettable experience. No one.
