<br/>Probst: Previously on Survivor: There was no food at Rotu, so the tribe competed for the kill. Kathy was the first to find protein... We found thousands of shells! <br/>Probst: ...and redeemed herself with the tribe. <br/>Great job, Kath. <br/>Maraamu awoke with their own morning radio show. <br/>It's time for some music. We're going to put on an oldie but a goodie. <br/>Probst: But Mama Patricia soon put end to their fun. <br/>Now, listen to me. I'm only going to tell you once. <br/>I know: everything has to go back where we find it. <br/>Go back. <br/>Probst: In the reward challenge, Rotu continued their streak... Rotu! ...taking home the coveted snorkeling gear. Rob then choked in the immunity challenge, sending Maraamu to their second straight tribal council, where Rob used his influence over Sarah... She'll vote whatever way I tell her to vote. <br/>Probst: ...to help oust Patricia from the tribe. Patricia, the tribe has spoken. 14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Hey, Rob, bring it over. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Hey, Rob, bring it over. I got some wood. <br/>Yep. <br/>Is there ferns on the bottom? <br/>Uh, yeah. <br/>Coming back with six people is definitely a checkup from the neck up. And, um, for us to come back to the camp and just act like business as usual was something we knew we couldn't do. So where is everybody at? How is everybody feeling? <br/>This morning when I woke up and you guys were already gone, I knew immediately that you guys were talking [bleep], saying I wasn't working. When no one even bothered to wake me up, you know what I mean? If you needed me to do something, damn it, get me up. <br/>Then you're being paranoid. Please don't be sensitive about this. <br/>Apparently, I have to be. <br/>No, you don't. <br/>Apparently, I have to be. <br/>Sarah, what you said tonight caused me to vote for you because I was wavering between two people, and what you said tonight, when you said that I want to save my energy for myself, that made me put your name down. <br/>Save my personal energy for the challenges. <br/>We've got to learn stop letting this stuff sit on our shoulder too long. There's just too much drama in this place. <br/>It's not that we don't know what needs to be done. It's the lack of communication and lack of respect because we're all grown people out here. <br/>I don't think it's a lack of respect. <br/>There's no lack of respect. <br/>Well, you know what? When you're not communicating with people, to me it's a form of disrespect when you don't communicate your feelings, when you just assume that people are going to get up when you want to get up. <br/>Sarah and Sean, they don't want you to ask them to do anything. They think they should know to do it and if you ask them they're going to get pissed off. So I don't know what kind of communication they want, maybe telecommunication, I don't know. <br/>You got upset the other day when you went to go get water because you felt like I asked you to go get water. Is that right? <br/>It wasn't like I got upset. I felt like you almost told me to go get water. It was the way you said it. <br/>I would have gone with you. That's the thing, Sean. I mean, I'm not. You think I'm being selfish? You think I'm being bossy? <br/>No, not at all. <br/>The thing that bothers me is the complaining going on in camp. You know, you signed on to do this, this is a 39-day survival game, but you still have to survive. Otherwise, you're just going to dwindle out and peter out and you're not going to have any energy. I mean I'm glad we're airing this all out. <br/>Oh, totally. We should do this. <br/>It is good. Obviously you guys all feel the same. <br/>Gina, where you at? <br/>I think we all saw this coming. <br/>Where you at? <br/>I'm fine. I'm good to go. <br/>She needs a pepperoni pizza. <br/>Yeah, I need a pepperoni pizza. [laughing] Totally. <br/>I'm drying everything out. <br/>Totally. <br/>I'm drying everything out. Got a lot of rain last night. Our shelter leaked. Our heads and our feet got wet. It was dripping all over the place. The wind was up. It was coming in from both sides of the shelter. I think everybody basically just froze their butts off. <br/>We don't have blankets, so it's cold at night. Blankets make all the difference in the world. So it's... it's hard. <br/>Nobody slept very well, so the first thing that a couple people jumped on was repairing the shelter. <br/>There's something about this tribe, I mean there really is. We get a lot of strength from the good cheer and the kindness and the strong spirits that we have. <br/>Always. <br/>If you can bring four fronds, green fronds, I'd like to make sort of just a light doorway to stop the wind. <br/>All right. Being with Kathy the first few days was rough, but she has turned around 100% and now I love it. <br/>I switched it around. I'm also playing a little low-key. Go with the flow and not worry so much. Thank you, man. Thank you. Very nice. That's for all the food. You're always bringing home food. <br/>Food, man, food. <br/>So I got too close to the fire. Well, that's somebody's cold feet tonight. <br/>Neleh, she's got that little pixie look. Her attitude, her vivaciousness, just reminds me of my two daughters at home. <br/>Do I look tough? <br/>They look like antlers. <br/>Every single person on this tribe calls me Sweet Pea. I don't know why. Paschal has the greatest heart of anybody on the whole entire team. <br/>Be careful. That's a sharp one right there. <br/>All right, I'll be all right. He's like the father figure of the group. <br/>They just call me Pappy. So I think that's probably the name I'm known now is Pappy. <br/>He's always smiling and winking and just giving tons and tons of love. I mean, of anybody on the whole team that I would have the toughest time voting off, it would definitely be him. <br/>I landed right on the top of would definitely be him. <br/>I landed right on the top of a sea urchin, and embedded about 12 sea urchin needles in my fingers. Oh! Those suckers went in deep. I got to go back in, and I got to get somebody to pee on it. That's supposed to be what you're supposed to do for that kind of venomous sting from a sea urchin is to urinate on it. It's supposed to help with the swelling and the pain. I need somebody who has to pee. I need somebody who can pee on my hand! Somebody can pee? Somebody have to go to the bathroom? <br/>Paschal went out to try to pee. He did that performance anxiety thing, I think. So it was, it was just good timing that I had to go to the bathroom. This is gross, but... I don't care. I don't care. Just pee on it. You'll have to put it under there. <br/>Okay, okay, I don't know where my hand is. <br/>Just get it under there. <br/>Okay. Okay. I mean, that could have been like peroxide as far as I was concerned. I didn't think of it being weird that she was squatting down and I had my hand between her legs. <br/>Good thing you had to go to the bathroom. [laughing] I mean, it was like do what it takes to make it feel good, I don't care what you have to do. Thank you. <br/>Finally I think when I was pulling down my pants I suddenly got very embarrassed, but it made me feel good. At least I performed in the call of duty. <br/>Good morning, good morning, y'all. This is DJ Ready once again on the morning wake-up show here on the aisle of Maraamu! Check it out. We have such a beautiful morning. Hey, guys, wouldn't you say it was freezing last night? My balls were ice cubes! Let's get our first chopper report from our weatherman Hunter Ellis. What you got for us up in the air, Hunter? <br/>Well, we're up here above the Marquesas Coast. It's going to be about a million degrees according to Jose or Julio, whatever his name is this morning. <br/>After last night's tension, it almost seems like the rain was a way of flushing out all of the tension that had transpired yesterday. <br/>No, no. Are they in or are they out? Call in right now. Come on. Let them light up. There we go. We got one. We got one. Caller, you are on the air! <br/>I'd just like to say they're about 45,000 times worse than mosquitoes, and there's no cure for them and there's the most miserable thing I've ever encountered. A no-no is spelled N-O-N-O, is a little bug that's about a thousand times more vicious than a mosquito and it's about the size of a flea. You can't even see it. It bites you. You don't even know it bites you. And they itch like crazy. <br/>I'm going to go to somebody else. Come on. Light me up. Light me up. <br/>Beep, beep, beep. <br/>Caller two, you are on the air, what's up? <br/>I think the no-nos suck, too, because I've never been bit by mosquitoes and these things are getting me as well. <br/>Tell me something. I hear a rumor that there's two types of no-nos out there. They got some black ones and they got some white ones. Which ones you think you been bit by? <br/>I think I'm getting bitten by the black the most. Because those are the ones that... Ring, ring, ring. Ring, ring! <br/>Oh, my God, my phones are lighting up. Brother, what did you say? What happened there? <br/>This is ludicrous! It's a conspiracy! Why the black no-nos got to be the worst ones the island? Huh? The white ones are just as bad! The black ones get blamed for all the bad ones. They incarcerate all the black no-nos. All the black no-nos get in trouble with the law. I tell you, I'm out of here. I got to go. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Oh, we got to go. Yep. Gosh, this sand is hot. <br/>Oh, to what do we owe this honor? <br/>Probst: I come bearing supplies for your next challenge. On board we got 50 stocks of bamboo, 300 feet of rope. You have to construct a raft, strong enough to carry all six of you guys, plus some supplies you're going to pick up along the way. You can use anything I'm giving you, anything you have in camp, anything you find on the island. Don't be skimpy. Make a strong craft. Let's get that bamboo. Come on, guys. Dump it! See you at the challenge. <br/>Whoa. See you at the challenge. <br/>Whoa. <br/>Are you all right? <br/>Let me see. <br/>Where did you cut your foot? <br/>Underneath, a big rock got in between my shoe and my foot and just sliced up my toe nicely. <br/>It's an injury day. <br/>It's pretty deep right there, right at the toe. Are you going to start crying like I did? <br/>No. <br/>Fine, don't. <br/>All the tattoos on my body, you think I have a little problem with pain, man? <br/>Got to get it really cleaned out there, buddy, okay? <br/>Do what you got to do. <br/>Take a deep breath because I'm going to scrub it. Get ready, one, two, three. Make sure we get all the junk out of there. Okay, okay, okay. That's good. Are you okay? <br/>I'm okay. <br/>Get me the knife. I am a registered nurse and everyone has confidence that I know what I'm doing and I know what I'm looking for in case something bad should happen. Okay, this might hurt a little bit. You'll be okay. I'm just doing a little cutting here. Just that piece of skin. <br/>Nice work, butcher. Good job. <br/>It's pain, you know, you got to deal with it. It's only pain. You know. Pain is easy. Life is hard, man. <br/>How you doing? Thumbs up, way to go. <br/>No problem, Mama. <br/>Good. <br/>I got nine more. <br/>You're the man! <br/>I got nine more. <br/>You're the man! <br/>Get a rope over the pile, and let's lay out the bamboo. We are building basically a pontoon boat. Watch your toes. All the cargo goes on the platform in the center, and three rowers on each side. Genius, if I say so myself. The raft was a really fun project. Let's do this one first and that one second. <br/>Rob and Gabriel were working on the raft, and Gabriel had a really good plan. It was sort of like a Kon-Tiki deal. <br/>You want it here? <br/>Yeah, I want I there. <br/>Okay, my toe is bleeding or falling off, I'm not going to let my teammates down. <br/>That's good. <br/>Rob, are you all right to walk around, man? <br/>Yeah, don't worry about it. Just call me hop-a-long. You know, it's not just fun and games outs here. You know, you got to keep on surviving, and you got to keep on working to help the group. Two heads are definitely better than one, especially when you're out here. You need every idea you can get your hands on. <br/>Oh, that's good! <br/>Locked on, my brother. <br/>Good, Rob. As far as a team, I don't think we'll be up against anything like what we've got going on here. This is, this is a really cool craft. Just getting to make this, this has been an absolute blast. <br/>Way to go, guys! <br/>We're all just having a really fun time out here. We'd love to win some more challenges. <br/>Get a really big raft, and it's going to be tough to maneuver. <br/>The more of this we use, the more buoyant it is. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And the more weight we can carry without being dragged in the water. <br/>What if we have to lift the raft and carry it somewhere after? <br/>A raft is for the water. <br/>He said we got to carry stuff. So the less buoyancy we have, the less weight we can carry. <br/>Remember the last time with the canoe, and then we had to carry it up the rocks. <br/>We might have a finish line in the water. <br/>The morning after the tribal council after we had the big blowout at the campfire, you know, everyone seems like, "Hey, a whole new beginning." There's been a rebirth. Everything, you know, we're good to go now. To me, it didn't really seem that clear. <br/>Sean, you got a couple more long ones? How many is this? It wasn't a problem with Hunter stepping up. Take the lead. I don't have a problem with him leading. I just have a problem with whomever. I don't like overconfidence when it comes, when I'm in your tribe or I'm on your team. So I refuse to sit back and watch the golden boy just smile and make suggestions and look like the leader and people not know that he's here to play a game. <br/>Tie it around the frame, right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's weird. You might not believe it, but I am totally 100% like Hunter without a doubt. I would not let it show out here for the life of me because I know that people are not going to take kindly to that type of a atmosphere. Everybody wants to think that they're the big man. So the smart guy will sit back and let everybody step up to be the big man, and then in the end just bank in on their mistakes. <br/>When they see this, they're going to give us jobs down at the shipyard, making boats. <br/>One, two, three pieces across and then the rest... Everything gets wrapped good twice. <br/>A bunch of us were out, you know, gathering shells today. John actually stuck his hand underneath a rock and an eel bit it. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>He got bit by an eel. Not a very good day at sea. <br/>Just lacerated the underside of my finger. Really, I mean, just ripped it open in just jagged shreds and it cracked my fingernail almost to the bed. <br/>Damn, that's big. Right down the center. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Does it hurt real bad? <br/>Worse than the last time. <br/>Good Lord, what is going on? <br/>He was panicked. I mean, he was on the verge of tears. He was in pain. It was obvious. <br/>Okay, I'm feeling a little dizzy. I'm going to sit down. <br/>Okay, why don't you sit down? <br/>All right. I'm just going to sit on the rock. Hold on. It's deep. It's like a crushing-type injury. I was scared. If my energy and what I'm contributing to the tribe diminishes, then that may put me at risk. And that just kind of hit me really hard. <br/>Everything can change in a heartbeat. Here John has gotten hurt twice today. Things change just like that out here. âª As I'm falling in love âª That you will feel the same âª I don't know âª I don't know âª I don't know. <br/>After being out in the sun for a while, we all got hot and we all felt that it was time to take a break. <br/>âª Oh, girl, you want so much to... to my world. âª Sometimes it does feel like, you know, you're camping with a bunch of kids that don't know what they've gotten into. Breakfast of champions. Coconuts. I mean, if you could pick a bunch of people you want to go camping with, I don't think this is the group you're going to accomplish the most with. Just because everybody thinks that this is a vacation. <br/>I just want to wash my hair. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Take a bath. <br/>The constant complaining about food and things being wet and dirty is driving me nuts. And I don't say anything, but it's like, what do you expect? I mean we're not at a Ritz-Carlton. We're not in a five-star hotel. A little bite of protein for everybody. <br/>People felt excited after eating that nasty raw fish. I wasn't. I'm sure it was a source of protein, but I would rather eat a bowl of my own doo-doo than that stuff again. <br/>Sean, you got to try this! <br/>I tried it already, dude. <br/>Have another one. It's not every night we get to have grapefruit! <br/>You don't come here to complain and when you complain, it just makes life miserable. Just suck it up and deal with it. <br/>Like, we can't rush towards grabbing something because then the raft will tip and things will slide off if we already picked them up. If we do get them aboard we want to try and stick them in that one little trough where we don't have the bamboo, so that way they'll be less likely to... I don't think we could survive if we lost another challenge. Our morale could not survive. In the reward challenge, whatever it is, we need it. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Welcome to today's reward challenge. <br/>All right! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Feel good? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right. It's a race. Each tribe has five containers anchored to the bottom of the ocean floor. You can paddle out in a crisscross fashion. Unclip five of your tribe's colored boxes. Load them on your raft. Race back to the finish. First tribe to get back here with all five wins a reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Today you get a choice. Comfort, blankets, pillows, and... three lanterns with fuel. [cheering] Or sustenance. A week's worth of rice. Winning tribe gets to decide. The rest of it goes home with me. Rotu, because you guys have two extra members, two people are sitting out. Neleh, Paschal, you're up here on the docks. Here we go. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Row, row, row! Row, row, row. Row... Row, guys. <br/>All right, let's go. <br/>Rob? <br/>Hard on the right. Hard on the right. <br/>Watch out, watch out. It's sinking us. <br/>Row, row. <br/>Turn it left. Turn it left. Hard. Ow, ow, ow. Okay. <br/>Okay. Row, row. <br/>Clear. <br/>Go, go, go, go. <br/>Hold up, now. Hold up. <br/>Let's go. Paddle. <br/>Row, row, row. <br/>Hard right. Hard right. Hard right. <br/>Row, row, row. <br/>Hard right, hard right. <br/>Go across. Cut across. <br/>Row, row. Come on. <br/>Row, row, row. Row. Row. Go, go. Row, row. We got number three. Go. <br/>Row, row, row. <br/>Dig deep. <br/>Dig deep, guys. <br/>Go, Sean, go, go. <br/>Okay, get me a little closer. Come on. Come on. <br/>Go. <br/>Hold on. <br/>Go, go. Go. <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Go. Row, row. Row, row. <br/>Row, row. Row, row, row. Row, row, row. [indistinct shouting] Row, row, row. [indistinct shouting] Row! Row... row... row... row... row... Row... row... row... row... row... Row... row... row... Row... row... Dig, guys, dig. [indistinct shouting] [shouting and cheering] Probst: Rotu! Rotu, what do you guys want? <br/>Okay, wait. Let's take a vote. <br/>Who wants comfort? Raise their hands. <br/>Probst: You're going to take the blankets, the pillows and the lanterns. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right. I'll deliver it to your camp. [cheering] Maraamu, sorry to say you guys can head back toward the point. See you tomorrow. Nice effort. <br/>Zero for four totally sucks. Nice effort. <br/>Zero for four totally sucks. We have four L's. Four big L's. And we need a W bad. <br/>You guys want some papaya? <br/>Sometimes you need a fierce competitor to just keep harping it into you. We got four L's. It's not a good thing, but we have to go on. <br/>I just don't know what to do. I don't know what to do, don't know what to say. <br/>This sucks big time. <br/>I just can't figure out why they keep kicking our butts. <br/>Everyone is like, "What is the problem?" And I don't have the heart to say it. But to me winning is an attitude you carry around 100% of the time, every day, all the time. It's not something you turn off and you turn on an hour before you go to a challenge. We would be winning more of these things if we were working together as a team to accomplish things around the camp. There's where your basis of teamwork begins. So I think that's where our problem is stemming from right now, and that we're having a real tough time. <br/>You're making progress. <br/>You know, with some individual personalities that either aren't willing to work or do not take this game seriously. <br/>We didn't get no rice! <br/>We ain't got no rice! <br/>I wanted some rice! <br/>Do you got it? <br/>Oh, cool! <br/>What is that? <br/>Uh, that sucks. <br/>Hello. Well, it was a very nice necklace. <br/>There we go. <br/>I just broke the necklace. <br/>Okay. "Take turns at the helm. Tell us what to do. You'll work through the ups and downs to guide your tribe through." "It's time you learn the ropes. It's more than a game you're playing. Be the first down the winding path if you plan on staying." Show time. <br/>All we got to say is let's do it, Maraamu! <br/>Probst: Boy, that immunity idol has found a permanent home, huh? <br/>He's happy. He's happy. <br/>Probst: Give him back. <br/>Wow. <br/>See you soon. <br/>Probst: Wow, reaction, Maraamu? That's a confident statement from Rotu. <br/>The humble shall be exalted. <br/>Probst: You guys are due. <br/>We're due, long due. <br/>Probst: All right, big stakes today. Immunity. Today's challenge is a coconut maze race. Your goal: get three coconuts through the maze and in the hole. Here's how it works. You'll have one caller and four people controlling the maze. Using a system of pulleys, you will either raise or lower, depending on your caller's instructions. Only one rule: each time you get a coconut in the hole, you switch out callers. Rotate clockwise. First tribe to get all three through the maze and in the hole wins immunity. Three more days on the island. Losers, voting somebody else out tonight. Maraamu, this game only requires five. You will sit one out. Rotu you guys will sit three out. I'll give you guy a second to make your decisions. Rotu, you selected Tammy, John and Robert. Maraamu, you've chosen Gina. All right, everybody else take your spots. Let's go. Here we go, guys! Immunity at stake! Survivors ready?! Go! <br/>Towards you guys. Towards you guys. <br/>Down, Robert. Sarah, Sarah and Rob, there you go. Sarah and, and Hunter. <br/>All right, all right. All right. Lift your end, Zoe. Drop your end. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. Lift your end again, K.O. Lift your end, Sweet Pea. Lift your end, Sweet Pea. <br/>Hunter, Hunter. No, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Stop, stop. Stop right there. Down, Sean. There you go. Hunter, bring it, bring it back. <br/>Okay, okay, you got to leave your side up. All right, leave your side up, Pappy. Okay, now, that's it. <br/>Stop, stop, stop. Stop right there. Stop right there. Hunter. <br/>Towards me. <br/>Now Sean, there you go. Okay, Rob, and Sarah, down, slowly, right in there. There you go. Right there, let it slide. Rob, Sarah. <br/>Okay, all the way back up, Pappy. No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Lift your side up, Pappy! Lift your side up. KO, lift your side up a little bit. Sweet Pea, lift yours up, yes, yes, yes. All right, Pappy, lift your side up, KO leave your side down. <br/>Keep going, keep going, just a little. Keep going. There you go, there you go, there you go. Okay. Now, bring it. Sarah, stop, stop, stop right there. Sarah and... keep going. It's right there. It's right at the... There, yes! <br/>Probst: Switch out! <br/>All right, K.O., leave your side up. Pappy, leave your side up! Lift it. Turn it this way. That's it. That's it. That's it. <br/>Yeah! <br/>One more, one more. <br/>Switch, switch, switch! <br/>There you go. Sean, down, towards Sean. Slowly. Towards that then. Hunter straight down, let it slide. Vee and Hunter. Hunter and Sean. <br/>Sean and I down? <br/>Okay. <br/>You guys got it. <br/>Vee, down. Down, definitely. <br/>Okay, I'm going, I'm going. <br/>Okay. Okay, Hunter, straight down, yes, nice. Okay, straight towards me, it's in the hole! Towards Hunter. In it! <br/>Come on, baby. Put it in there. Put it in. <br/>Come on. Let's go! <br/>I can't see. I can't see. <br/>All right, Zoe. All the way around. Okay, K.O. you're down. <br/>Whoa, whoa, all right. Good, good, okay. It's in there, whoa. Whoa, whoa. It's coming towards Gabe. Coming towards Gabe. <br/>Down my side, down my side. <br/>Switch! Switch, go, go, go! <br/>Down, down. <br/>Towards Sean. <br/>You got it. <br/>Towards my way. Down, Sean, down. Up, Sean, up. Up, up. <br/>This is it, guys! <br/>Okay, to me, to me. <br/>Sweet Pea, down. <br/>Lift towards me. Lift towards me, Sweet Pea. <br/>Lift your side up, Pappy. Lift your side up, Pappy. <br/>Okay, okay. You're doing good. <br/>Down, down. <br/>Back to me, back to me. V, pull down. <br/>Okay, go down. <br/>I've got up. Okay, up, up. Down, down, there you go. <br/>Whoa, whoa. <br/>Up, Kathy and Sweet Pea. <br/>All right, Pappy, that way. <br/>Back to me, back to me. <br/>Sean, up. Sean, up. There you go. Hunter down, down, Hunter. There you go. Up. Bring it up, Hunter. <br/>Now we're in the hole. Here we go. [cheering] Yeah! [cheering] Probst: Rotu, third straight time, immunity. Nice job. Maraamu, good effort. Don't want to see you tonight again at tribal council. I'm sure you don't want to be there. But we have a date. Somebody else is going home. You guys can head back to camp this way. I'll see you in a little bit. <br/>You guys did so good. <br/>Ooh, are you okay? <br/>I'm good. <br/>It feels like crap going to the third straight tribal council. It's the worst feeling that, that, since I've gotten here. You know, this could be my last night, or it could be, you know, we go to tribal council again today and you might have to go in three days again. You know? You just don't ever know. It's just a difficult situation. It's very difficult. <br/>One way or another, we've got to, it's like, you've got to put your trust in somebody. If Rob wants a strong team to help him out, then... he'd be stupid to try and get rid of you or me. So he may go after Sean. I think we need to go after Sean tonight. <br/>To be honest with you, my first impression of Sean is that he was just like a lazy loudmouth, this and that, all for the drama. But I don't really not like him. I think he's a pretty good person. I don't know. <br/>I'm definitely leaning, I think in one direction. <br/>That makes me think. See, here's the thing. Me and you are the one that's making the decision. <br/>Yeah, and then we just pass it on. <br/>We tell the girls. <br/>It's important for me to have people on my team that are going to do what I tell them to do and not know that I'm telling them to do it. <br/>I looked on the boat now, and I looked over at your girl, a lot of times she's just like, cheer leading you on, man. I wanted to ask you about how you feel about her specifically. Not necessarily in voting, but are you catching feelings for her? <br/>Oh, no. No. <br/>No? I don't know, man. <br/>No, no, no. I'm just playing the game, man. <br/>The game always keeps you thinking. It really does. It doesn't matter if my team is stronger, physically or even stronger mentally. But just that they obey. Always think about your next move. As it is right now, our team's not that strong. <br/>That's why I think... Sean is not that good in the water. He's not that good at all. Are you okay? <br/>Oh, yeah, I'm fine. You don't have to worry about me. Just do what you got to do, you know. <br/>It's all in how smart these people are. If they realize if they need you, that's what will keep them loyal. Right? Fear, basically. It's a tough principle, but fear keeps people loyal. If they're afraid they have something to lose, then they'll do what they tell you to do. That's straight out of The Godfather. That's true. <br/>Probst: So, your third straight tribal council after five straight losses in challenges. Everybody getting along still, Sarah? <br/>Yeah, actually, the past couple days ever since we were here last we all had it out when we got home and cleared the slate, we've gotten along really good since then. <br/>Probst: Hunter, is Rotu just a stronger tribe or smarter or working better together? <br/>I'm not sure because I'm not over there, so I don't know. They may be working better together. I think whatever happens here tonight that we're probably going to have to go back and rebuild and rethink from the basics. You know, start with everything around camp and just rebuild that team effort, whoever the five may be that go back. <br/>Probst: Rob, are you surprised at the inability of this tribe to win a single challenge yet? <br/>I really don't think that the tribe is unable to win. I really do believe that each challenge we had has been very close, and I think it's just bad luck. We just seem to be one step behind right now. And whatever it's going to take to get us to that next level, that's what we need to find. <br/>Probst: V, how about you in terms of looking down the road, not only do you not have food, you're coming here and losing another member. Is attrition slowly going to just wear this tribe down to where you have no chance? <br/>I think at some point it probably will weigh heavily on each individual, but like all things, we've got to go deeper inside ourselves if we really want to win, and my inner strength comes from the Lord Jesus Christ, and somebody else may come from Buddha, somebody else may just come from looking at the stars. So everybody has to find that deep something that's rooted in them to bring it out. <br/>Probst: Sean, thinking back to day one, clean slate, anything was possible. Surprised to find that you've now been here three times and you guys haven't won yet. Does that shock you? <br/>Quite frankly, I'm getting sick of coming back here, man. I'm getting sick of losing. I've never lost this much in my life. I don't think it's any fault of anybody on this team. Like Rob said, it could be bad luck, we just a misstep here, a misstep there, but I know, me personally, it's wearing me down. <br/>Probst: Okay. It's time to vote. Rob, you're first. <br/>Sarah, I'm sorry. Rob, you're first. <br/>Sarah, I'm sorry. I'm casting this vote for two reasons. One: I don't think you're taking the game seriously enough, and two: I think this vote tonight may help me protect someone I think is valuable. <br/>Look here, player, definitely think is valuable. <br/>Look here, player, definitely was a team player to a certain extent. We definitely needed you as our strongest player, but remember, this is our game to outwit. Hopefully, I'll see you on the outside, and no hard feelings. Peace. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Hunter. Sarah. Sarah. Hunter. Two votes Hunter. Two votes Sarah. Initials, Hunter. Three votes Hunter. Two votes Sarah. Last vote. Hunter. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Good luck, you guys. <br/>Probst: Hunter, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Well, you're only nine days into a 39-day game. Anything can happen. Get back to camp. Get some sleep. Stay tuned for scenes Get some sleep. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor: More stuff. <br/>Probst: Gina fights for her life. <br/>They're not going to keep somebody like me around. If I thought you were a liability, I would have voted on you. <br/>Probst: But when the Survivors are given a chance to take fate into their own hands, the game takes a drastic turn. <br/>Here's where the game gets really interesting. <br/>I really don't understand the logic behind it right now, but, hey, you got me. I was camping with a bunch of knuckleheads, and I'll tell you that to your face when I see you again, and I will phone the Red Cross and let them know where you guys are so you can be airlifted out of there after you die of starvation and dehydration after the next couple days. Hang in there, Gina. I wish you guys the best of luck out there.
