<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor": At the  millennial tribe, Zeke and Adam were betrayed after a blindside. <br/>I’m upset right now. <br/>Now I’m going to have to play from the bottom. <br/>Jeff: At the gen-"X" tribe, David found an idol  and thought he might need to use it. <br/>It's definitely me, Ken, and CeCe on the bottom. <br/>Jeff: But Jessica wanted to turn on the majority alliance. <br/>Voting off Paul would be the best thing for our tribe. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Sunday and Lucy went along with Jessica's  plan and voted out Paul. Paul, the tribe has spoKen. Blindsiding Bret and Chris. 17 are left. Who will be voted out tonight. Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. <br/>I would like to talk. <br/>I’m not talking to you  tonight. I'll do it in the morning. When we got back from tribal I was, quite frankly, pissed off. I mean, that was a big blindside. I was about to take the rice and throw it in the ocean and make  my own tribe of one is what I was going to do. <br/>I don't understand what  happened. <br/>He was running the show. <br/>Stop whispering. Let's talk about it. <br/>We want to know what's what's going on. <br/>Exactly. <br/>Here's the problem we were up against. Paul looked right at me and said, "If boys want to do an  all-boys' thing, good luck."  Tonight there are some very unhappy people, especially Bret  and Chris. Whether or not they believe me I really don't know. I think right now there's too much anger. <br/>This hurt, trust me. This was not an easy decision for any of us to make. <br/>It seemed easy. <br/>I am very nervous now. I am hoping that this wasn't a bad idea. <br/>Did we make a mistake? <br/>Well, you can't think back. <br/>You move forward. <br/>This morning, I felt bad because Bret and Chris felt  betrayed. It's almost like you feel like you cheated on somebody. And then now the relationship has to mend itself. <br/>Yeah, just time. <br/>Give them time? <br/>Yeah. The guys are pissed off because they really trusted Jessica. And, honestly, I don't trust Jessica complete. She's the first one that implanted in my head voting out Paul,  right. There's a reason why she's implanting that in my head. It's like she's kind of trying to take control, and for me, I feel  I need to do something about it. <br/>So, on my behalf, like all-- you know, it was a game. But I know that you two are valuable, but I also can tell you  that the power hungry person had to take away another power-hungry person. <br/>I know exactly what  you're talking about. <br/>Lucy come up saying Jessica's the one pulling all the  strings here. Jess has a huge game going. And I applaud her for that, but you've now shown your cards. <br/>I want you guys to know, Ken  and dave completely trust me. So if you guys have anything you want to do it can happen. <br/>You think it can happen? <br/>Completely. <br/>I don't trust jess as far  as I can throw her. <br/>Right, but I’m letting you guys know I can. <br/>Got it. Lucy feels like she has dave and Ken in her pocket and possibly  would make a move on jess. I don't like jess. I can't stand her. So if I can help chop jess, that's what I’m going to do now. Next tribal, you gotta zap her ass. <br/>Right. Âª âª  Go hunting for that pig or whatever is out there so we can  eat it. Do you actually think there's a pig on this island? <br/>Well, we saw pig tracks on, like, the beach. <br/>The definitionave millennial would be a young person with  a lot of dreams ready to go out and conquer the world. <br/>Let's go kill a pig! <br/>And I appreciate that, because I’m a dreamer. Gen-x is like, "Okay, holly, college, 9 to 5. Get a life." I don't want that. <br/>Wait, did you hear that? <br/>It's a goat. <br/>Where is it? Where is it? <br/>It's up there. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>We should climb up the hillside. <br/>Let's go get it. <br/>Talk quietly. <br/>I know. <br/>They are all the way up there. Oh, my God. They can't be actually hunting, right? Hidden immunity idol searching has really died down at this  camp, but I have a feeling that it might still be out there, and so I do feel  like I need to rededicate myself to that search. Because after Mari was voted out, my head is definitely on the  chopping block. And if I can somehow get my hands on an idol, I could save  myself. Oh, my-- oh, my-- oh, my God! I knew it! I knew it! Oh, my God! I can't even open it I’m so excited. "Mother nature hides your safety. Your tribe motif marking the power. Your prize is well sheltered." God, why can't it just be  here? I have to keep looking? This is incredible. For a "Survivor" super-duper fan like me, this is what  dreams are made of. I found the clue, and now I've just got to figure this thing  out. <br/>Any luck? <br/>No. <br/>No goat. <br/>I don't know how much  time I can spare looking for it. So I gotta go back to camp and look another time. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! Millennials getting your first look at the new gen-x tribe. Paul voted out. <br/>What! <br/>Jeff: Last tribal council. <br/>Wow, I did not see that coming. <br/>I didn't see that coming. <br/>Jeff: All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward  challenge? <br/> Yeah! [ applause ]. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, you're going to race out to  retrieve a ring. You'll then race back to your flag pole while the other tribe  attempts to stop you any way they can. First tribe member to put one hand on the flag pole with one  hand on the rings, scores a point for their tribe. First to three wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah! [ applause ]. <br/>Jeff: I think you will like it. Steak, sausages, veggies, spices. <br/>Spicy! <br/>A grill! <br/>Jeff: Losers, nothing. <br/>Nada. <br/>Jeff: Worth playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Of course! <br/>Jeff: Millennials, you have one extra person. Sitting somebody out. Who is it going to be? Michelle going to sit this one out. Give everyone else a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right, here we go. First round, two men versus two men. It's going to be Chris and David taking on Jay and Adam. Interesting match-up out of the gate. All right, first round. Here we go. Survivors ready? Go! Big swells today. You're going to have to swim to that ring. Jay going right after Chris. Chris trying to push him off like a nat. That leaves Adam free to go for the ring. Great strategy by the millennials. Jay sacrificing his body. Adam now in trouble. He sees a big dude coming for him, and very easily, Adam gives  up the ring. No fight at all. Chris ties up Jay and Adam, leaving David to swim it back. <br/>Go, dave! <br/>Jeff: Chris is unstoppable, giving David all the time he  needs. First point goes to gen-x! All right, next round going to be the women. Sunday and CeCe taking on Figgy and Michaela. Here we go. Survivors ready? Go! Michaela and Figgy heading out quickly. CeCe going to stay back and play some defense. Sunday going to hang back as well. Let the millennials do all the work to get the ring. <br/>Sunday! <br/>Go forward! <br/>Jeff: Now the game gets interesting. Michaela tosses to Figgy. It's Figgy and CeCe now. Is CeCe strong enough to get that back to her flag pole? Now the battle's going to start. Michaela pulling it closer. Michaela and Figgy getting closer to that flag pole. CeCe and Sunday trying to hold them back but it is not working! Michaela can see it. Can she get there? Yes! Millennials score. We are tied, 1-1. Next round, Bret and Ken for gen-x. And pieted Taylor and will for the millennials. Here we go. Survivors ready? Go! Everybody going for the ring. Nobody hanging back. Taylor interprets Ken. Takes him out of it. Opens the door for will. Taylor very aggressive tying up Bret. Here comes Ken now after will. <br/>Keep going, will! <br/>Jeff: Ken has stripped will of the ring. Taylor now tied up by Bret. Taylor cannot get away from Bret. And will cannot catch Ken. <br/>Go, Ken! <br/>Jeff: Taylor gets away from Bret. He's in on it now. Now we've got a battle. Ken pushing forward. Bret helping to drag. Gen-x very close. <br/>Come on, Bret! <br/>Jeff: Can they get there? Taylor trying to fight them off. Will now pulling back. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Ken scores for gen-x. Gen-x back in the lead. 2-1. Next round going to be Jessica and Lucy taking on Michaela and Hannah. Gen-x leads 2-1. Playing to 3. They can win it right here. Here we go. Survivors ready? Go. Jessica swimming for the ring. Hannah takes on Lucy trying to hold her back. But Lucy getting away. Jessica all alone right now. <br/>Go, go! Go! <br/>Go! <br/>Jeff: Lucy trying to tie up Michaela and Hannah now. Michaela now takes her top off so she can go after Jessica. Taylor now going after Jessica trying to take that ring. Millennials need to score, they're down 2-1 help huge reward on  the line. Lucy trying to pull them closer. <br/>This way! This way! <br/>Jeff: Lucy trying to get Hannah off her. She can see that flag. Michaela pulling them back now. Michaela pulling them further away from the flag. Michaela has some momentum now. Michaela is digging, digging! Determined to score for the millennials! That is effort! Michaela does it! Millennials tie it up 2-2. Huge effort from Michaela. Lost her top in the process. Did not care. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: That is what it takes to win on "Survivor."  Way to go. You literally left it all out there. <br/>Jeff: Now we move to a showdown. This is it. All the marbles. David and Chris versus Jay and Zeke. <br/>Come on, hulk. <br/>Jeff: Tremendous pressure on Zeke and Jay to pull an  upset. Here we go. For reward. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Dig deep! David! Dig deep! <br/>Jeff: Zeke, the smallest guy out there, goes after Chris,  trying to just annoy him. Keep him pestered. And it's working. Jay has the ring. Jay has an opening. Zeke doing a great job on Chris. Chris now grabs the ring from Jay. <br/>Come on, Jay! <br/>You're so close! <br/>Jeff: It is a huge battle. Zeke is really making it difficult. Here comes a big swell. Engulfing everybody. This is the closest the millennials have been. Zeke working on Chris. Jay pulling on David. The ring slips away. Chris now has it. Jay now with a hand to again. Chris now pulling it. Chris now moving cloafers. A huge turn of events, another swell. Pushing them closer. They got it! Wow! Gen-x wins reward! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: Wow! <br/>Jeff: All right, that was a giant challenge. Gen-x comes out victorious. Nice reward will be waiting for you back at camp. Enjoy it. You earned it. <br/>Thank you, Jeff! <br/>Jeff: Millennials, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. Âª âª  Good job, guys. <br/>Michaela crushes it. The girls crushed it. <br/>The last group, I think you and you were last, you all were  so good! <br/>So close! <br/>The reward challenge was a nightmare from the beginning. Their guys are huge. I mean, Chris is, like, the size of three of me. And he just, like, picks me up and throws me. <br/>Yeah, boom! With one hand. <br/>We get demolished. <br/>Michaela, on the other hand, is like an amazon woman. <br/>M.V.P. That was impressive. <br/>I’m one of those people I  just like to win, you know. And when things happen, like my whole bathing suit getting  ripped off, it's like, you can either lose or you let your bathing suit get  ripped off and win. So I was like, they're about to see some ta-tas today. <br/>We just misstrategized this time. We could have won. <br/>I wish I could have  performed better but that was never going to be my challenge. I'm not super comfortable with totally physical competitions. I'm going to go wash these shoes off. I just feel like I need to find this idol more than ever, but I don't  have a whole lot of time left because I need to make sure I find it before we  either go back to tribal council or swap. "The tribe motif marks the power." this is the prize  motif. "The prize is well sheltered." sheltered, shell. The clue says you have to look for the tribe motif, somewhere in  this designated area and look for a shell. And if you break open the shell, you'll find the hidden immunity  idol. No, no. Back to the beach. I'm looking everywhere, and I just don't see it. It's not there. So I just walk along the beach and hope that something hits me,  that I find something. Aarrggh! Dang it! Oh! This is the tribe motif! That's what I’m talking about! Did anyone see me? Open up! I need to get back to camp! Oh! I don't need you anymore. You can go away. That will do it. <br/>Hey, Adam! <br/>Oh, no! <br/>How's your idol search going? <br/>I’m working on it. <br/>Good luck, buddy! <br/>I hope Hannah didn't just  bust me. Did she see me with this? Oh, God. Oh, my God! I'm going to put this on just to feel good. I just found the hidden immunity idol. This is beyond my wildest dreams. I finally went for it today, and I got it. Mom, this is for you. I love you so much. It was really tough to make the decision to come out here. My mom was diagnosed about seven months ago with stage four lung  cancer. It's such a devastating disease. It's been such a nightmare. It's the worst thing you can possibly imagine. And so to have, like, my biggest dreams coming true at the same  time that my worst nightmare is happening, it's-- it's-- it's just not-- it  doesn't feel real. My mom is a huge super fan. She's the ultimate reason for being here. I want to give my mom something to look forward to. Being able to watch me find this, that's what I came out here to  do is bring some joy back to my family. Âª âª  Everybody saved their sauce annual. <br/>Sausage for breakfast. <br/>We still have peppers and onions. <br/>I haven't been this happy  since I've been here. <br/>Anybody need water? I'm going to fill water. <br/>I’m good. <br/>Okay. <br/>Have you talked to anybody about, in the event that we  lose? <br/>I’m not going to give you  a name till later. <br/>Okay. <br/>Because I don't want any, like talking out here. <br/>No, that's fine. I went with a walk with liewtiony today trying to get a sense of  what's going on in her head because even though I survived the last tribal  council, Ken and I are still on the bottom so I think the smartest thing  right now is to go wherever the majority is leaning. <br/>You two have nothing to worry about. <br/>Okay. What are you thinking? <br/>We're going to get Jessica out. You two don't have to be paranoid at all. So I don't want to see you guys talking to anybody else. If I do, I’m going to get upset. <br/>Okay. <br/>That's it. Are you comfortable with it? Everybody's on board. Are you going to tell her? <br/>No. <br/>Because if you do, then everybody's not going to trust  you. <br/>I know. <br/>Jessica? Okay. <br/>Okay? <br/>Thanks. <br/>Lucy approached me and dave and said, "We're going to  vote out jess." and what really got to me was Lucy basically had a list  of rules and regulations of what we were and weren't aloud to do. Do not talk to this person. Do not sneak off here. Do not go off by yourself. And I’m thinking, we went from one dictator to another, and it  doesn't fly with me. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Jeff: All right, let's get to today's immunity challenge. First things first, Zeke, take back the idol. <br/>See you soon. <br/>Jeff: Oh, "We'll see you soon, gen-x," they say. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to race through a series of  obstacles to a chair. Your tribe will then lift the chair, allowing to you retrieve 10  numbered bags. Then the next person goes. Once you've retrieved all 30 bags, you will then use the pieces  inside to solve a word puzzle. First tribe to get it right wins immunity, safe from the vote. Losers go to tribal council, where somebody will be voted out of  this game. Millennials, you have one extra person. Who is going to sit out at this challenge? <br/>I'll sit out. <br/>Jeff: Adam, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else gets a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right, here we go. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, Figgy. <br/>Jeff: Obstacles first. Chris making it look really easy. <br/>Nice, Figgy! <br/>Jeff: Chris quickly through high-step. Chris is in the chair. Start pulling, gen-x. If you can get Chris up, you can get anybody up. <br/>Let's go, guys. <br/>Jeff: Figgy in the chair, she's going for one. You gotta get them in order, 1-10, then race back. <br/>All the way to your left, fig, all the way to your left. <br/>Jeff: Chris has to wait three times what Figgy weighs. <br/>Pull, pull, pull! <br/>Up, up! Left, left. <br/>Got it. <br/>Jeff: Chris at two, Figgy at two. We are dead even right now. Chris at three. Gen-x in the lead. They've got number four. Figgy stuck on 3. Chris has number 5. Millennials starting to fall behind. Chris is whipping through it now. Now with 6. Now with 6. Figgy has 6 now. Chris has one left. Chris has all 10! You gotta get them on the table so you can head back. <br/>All the way up to the right. Head back now. <br/>Let's go, let's go! <br/>Jeff: Figgy has 10. <br/>Another down. <br/>Go! <br/>Jeff: Here comes Ken for gen-x. <br/>Good job, Figgy. <br/>Jeff: Figgy heading back. Ken now in the chair. <br/>Go, go! <br/>Jeff: Ken looking for 11-20 now. <br/>Go, go! <br/>Jeff: Here comes Michelle. Ken now with 14. Michelle trying to catch up. Ken has 15. <br/>Up, up. <br/>Jeff: Millennials are fighting to stay in this. <br/>All the way up. <br/>Jeff: Ken working to get number 20. It's taking everything from his tribe. He's got it! <br/>Down, down, down down. <br/>Jeff: So far, the gen-x strategy working well. <br/>There you go! Nice! <br/>Jeff: Michelle has 18. <br/>Here comes David for gen-x. And Michelle has 20. The millennials are back in it, just like that. David working his way through the high-step. Just like holly football! David in the chair now. <br/>All the way back! <br/>Jeff: Here comeses Michaela. She was unstoppable in the reward challenge. David with 24. Michaela now has to get 21-30 in order. Can she catch David? David with 26. <br/>27, 28. Right next to it! Right next to it. <br/>Jeff: 28 for David. <br/>Jeff: Michaela quickly has 24. David has 29. David now with one piece left. <br/>Down, down, down! <br/>Jeff: And he's got it. David heading down now. Go, dave, go! <br/>Jeff: Michaela has 29! David now, they have all 30. Go, gen-x! <br/>You got this! <br/>Pull, pull! <br/>Jeff: Michaela has 30. Drop, drop, drop. We have got another tight challenge. We're now in the word phrase part of this challenge. You have 30 letters. You gotta figure out what the phrase is in order to live another  day in this game. This is where communication is key. Millennials counting letters out. Will this work? No need to put the pieces down if you know it won't work. Gen-x has a different approach. I want to see it. <br/>Come on, guys. Come on, guys. <br/>That's not it. That's not it. <br/>Jeff: Millennials, thinking, talking. <br/>Feels. <br/>Jeff: A bit like the tortoise and the hare. David with another idea. Is this the right one. <br/>Jeff: So many words you could spell with these letters. What could it be? The millennials have spent a lot of time talking and thinking. Gen-x experimenting. Two different approaches. Which one will prove to be successful? <br/>Doesn't fit. That's it, that's it! <br/>Jeff: Gen-x with yet another idea. Millennials not panicking. Don't even seem to realize there is another tribe that they're  competing against. They are doing their own thing millennial style. <br/>There's no "D." we vehicle out here a long time. It has been a study in contrasts. Gen-x tries something it, doesn't work, they try something else. Millennials, exploring in their minds but not moving many  letters. <br/>Girls, girls. What about--  That's it, dave. That's it. <br/>It's something...  Somebody. Loses somebody. <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: Millennials now moving quickly. Out of nowhere, both tribes now have some momentum. You can feel the energy picking up now. <br/>Just do it! Just do it, dave! Just do it! <br/>Jeff: Millennials think they have it out of nowhere. Say it. <br/>Somebody loses their place tonight. <br/>Jeff: That is right! Millennials win immunity. Nobody from their tribe will be losing their claim tonight. Millennials, you wanted it back. You got it. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Enjoy the night off. All right, gen-x, tribal council tonight. Somebody will be the fourth person voted out of this game. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. It was a hard puzzle. What were we going to do? <br/>Get the fire started. <br/>Losing immunity today was a tough loss because tonight at  tribal, I’m not sure what's going to happen. I mean, Bret and I just got blindsided two night ago, so I don't  feel comfortable at all. But we have a plan to blindside jess, and I’m counting on Lucy  to make that happen. <br/>Puzzles are just killing us. <br/>I opinion. <br/>You know? <br/>We did the best we could, though. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I got them on board  already. <br/>Are you sure? <br/>Yeah, for sure, for sure. So it's Ken, dave, you, me, and Bret. And we'll do Jessica. I'm like a tiger mom because the scenario they love is me being  in control. I mean, my husband and kids dislike me a lot of times because I’m  making all the decisions, but somebody has to do it. So if it's successful at home, it should be successful here. <br/>What are you thinking? <br/>It's very, very simple. This morning when you and I were scolded and told not to speak to  anyone, I was done. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Loosey and Bret and Chris and Sunday all linked up  together. That put you and I and CeCe back at the bottom. What has to happen, in my eyes, is me, you, CeCe, jess vote for Lucy. <br/>That's only four. <br/>And jez pulls in Sunday. <br/>Oh, my God. In real life, I think Lucy's used to, like, calling the shots,  but out here you have to be careful not to say the wrong thing and rub people  the wrong way because you can really piss some people off. And that's exactly what happened. Because now Ken wants to vote her out. And to be honest, it sounds like a really great idea. <br/>We're voting for Lucy, okay. Lucy can't get wind we're talking. I want to end this right now, because I see her over there, but Lucy,  Lucy, Lucy, okay. <br/>Got you. <br/>Sweetie, Lucy wants you out. She, Chris, and Bret don't trust you. They don't trust you at all. The only way we stay is if Lucy goes. <br/>What did you hear over there, though? <br/>It's your name. <br/>Who said my name? <br/>Since Paul went down, Lucy thinks it was all you. Lucy came and grabbed me and David and said you're not to be  trusted. It's your name going down. <br/>My name. <br/>It's your name going down. You have to talk to Sunday. If you don't talk to Sunday, you're done. <br/>I am stunned. Ken's telling me that I’m now the one that people are gunning  for because I was the mastermind behind the Paul thing. Which surprises me greatly, because I felt we all kind of came  up with it together. So it seems a little suspicious. <br/>Okay. I think we're all voting CeCe. <br/>That's what I figured. <br/>But Ken's saying that you are telling everybody to vote  for me. And trying to convince me to vote you. <br/>He said, "Let's vote Lucy off?"  Yes. <br/>Right now things are blowing up in a big way. <br/>Ken told jess. <br/>I have to say I’m shocked. <br/>That was the stupidest move in the world. <br/>That's just dumb. <br/>Ken, Jessica ran and told Lucy what you said. <br/>Why? It doesn't make sense. I'm shocked. I felt the connection that I had with jess was genuine. And I just found out she totally betrayed me, take everything I said  and delivering it to Lucy on a silver platter. <br/>So who are you voting for? <br/>I don't know. I don't like people coming up and telling me what to do and  telling me who I can and can't talk to. You came up to me and said don't speak with anyone. You came up and basically gave me a list of rules of what me as  an adult are not allowed to do. <br/>Ken ended up being a snake. He's pissed off of because how I came to him. Looking back, I guess I could have been nicer. But Ken is so emotional like a girl. Get serious. We're just voting out Jessica. Why have emotions about voting people off right now? The whole thing sat least you're in the game now, right. <br/>What the hell is going on? Are we going to do this or not? <br/>I thought it was Jessica. <br/>At this point, things are so messed up. I think the safest thing might be to just write down Jessica's  name. But if I do that, I just end up back on the bottom. <br/>You're not gonna vote for me? <br/>I’m not voting you off. Another option I have, I could play my immunity idol for Jessica  and save her, but I lied to Lucy straight to her face and I think she knows  it. I'm sure she knows it. <br/>Everybody pack your clothes today because we have a snitch  in this place. <br/>I just want to have the  idol just for safety and security. I don't plan on playing it but-- aaahhh! I have a lot to think about. I have a lot to think about. <br/>Jeff: Let's talk about last tribal council. David, did it bring this tribe together or did it do a better  job of signifying game on? <br/>I don't think last tribal  brought us together. I think it was still the right move, but, yeah, the game is  absolutely on. <br/>Jeff: Chris, what was your reaction after you knot back to  camp after the last vote? <br/>Well, Bret and I were clearly upset with the other people  that were in the alliance. I mean, we were completely blindsided. The state of this tribe is complete chaos. But we have got to figure it out, or we're in deep trouble. <br/>Jeff: So, Jessica, is Chris really believes he was  blindsided along with Bret, what does that mean now to the five remaining of  the six? <br/>I think that all of us  have been processing why things happened the way they happened at the last  tribal. But,usly, the ramifications of it we're still seeing, and whether  or not we've come back together as a five, I hope that we have. <br/>Jeff: Lucy, so it sounds like the last tribal council  really was a bomb. It just blew up, and now the game is being played. <br/>Yeah. Everybody just started getting really insecure. You know, we heard so many different things. Somebody mentioned your name. Somebody mentioned somebody else's name. So that's why there is chaos. Nobody knows who is going to vote for who? <br/>Jeff: What do you think? Do you have a sense tonight? <br/>I thought I was okay,  until Jessica told me Ken was interested in voting me out today and I don't  even he was able to create enough numbers to make that happen. <br/>Jeff: Ken, you're nodding your head like you agree to  that. <br/>Yes, she's referring to a conversation we had earlier  today. And there are different ways you can can ask people of thinks,  "Do you mind doing this? Are you okay with this?" and it's also coming up and  saying, "You're going to do this."  That's how I talk. I can be blunt, but most of the time when I speak to men I think  you can handle bluntness, and a lot of them tell me they appreciate it. If you really look at it, if I was him, I would be like,  "Well, Lucy's telling me something to help me go to the next, you know,  "--  You realize you're kind of doing it again. <br/>No, no, no, but what I was coming at, get it done quick. Here's the decision. There's no explanation. You know, that was the whole point of what I was trying to do. <br/>Jeff: So, Ken, the takeaway is Lucy now believes you want  her out, and have at least talked to Jessica about it. So how comfortable are you, that tonight's vote will go the way  you think it's going to go? <br/>I waivered all day, and  that's what happens when someone I was really loyal with wasn't so loyal. You know. <br/>Jeff: Jessica, you had a big reaction. Was he talking about you? <br/>He was. I know he was talking about me. But was I supposed to trust what you told me 100% about what you  told me other people said about me today? <br/>Yeah. <br/>That's the thing. You never know who's telling the truth? <br/>It's a live tribal. <br/>Jeff: Live meaning it's not in stone. <br/>Exactly. You leave the beach with an idea of what you are going to do at  tribal, and then you get to tribal and it changes. Anything can happen at tribal. It's completely unpredictable. <br/>Jeff: Jessica, look at your body language! Have you second guessed your vote at all tonight? Chris, how about you? <br/>As far as second guessing my vote tonight, I’m not. I might be hit in the mouth again, but I’m not second guessing  it. The one question you need to ask is who is the sucker at the  table? Everybody might be all in, but who is the chump playing who  shouldn't have been playing? That seems the bigger question. <br/>Jeff: Seems like a good time to find out. It is time to vote. Sunday, you're up. <br/>This is for you, Pauley. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Jeff: If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want  to play it, now would be the time to do so. <br/>Jeff. Oh, man. Can I say a few words really quick? <br/>Jeff: Yeah, step right up here. <br/>All right. I want you all to know it's been a pleasure meeting you. I enjoy all of your company. And now for maybe the bit that's going to upset some people, I’m  going to play this for Jessica. <br/>Jeff: All right. This is a hidden immunity idol. Any vote cast for Jessica will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote, Jessica. Does not count. Jessica. Does not count. Jessica, does not count. Jessica, does not count. Jessica, does not count. CeCe. That's one vote CeCe. Lucy. That's one vote CeCe, one vote Lucy, one vote left. Fourth person voted out of "Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen-x," Lucy. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Jeff: Lucy, the tribe has spoKen. Time for you to go. You talk about live tribals. It doesn't get any more live than that. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org  Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor." the gen-x idol is  back up for grabs. <br/>That idol search party. <br/>Jeff: And a surprise switch-- drop your buffs. Threatens to tear two lovers apart. <br/>I love Taylor. <br/>My biggest fear is getting split up. We have no idea what's going to happen. <br/>I almost controlled the  whole situation, and it almost worked. I wasn't expecting dave to use the immunity. And I was quite shocked. I just went full force and probably should have taken it a  little slow. That's one of the lessons I was learning. But, unfortunately, a little too late.
