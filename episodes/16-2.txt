<br/> Jeff: Previously on Survivor, ten of Survivor'sbiggest  fans were pitted against ten favorites from seasons past. Both tribes  immediately competed for a shot at individual immunity. Yau-Man narrowly won  the idol for the favorites, and he helped Kathy find the idol for the fans. <br/>Pick up that! <br/>Jeff: The fans struggled on their beach and failed to  build their beach and failed to build a solid shelter. a solid shelter. <br/>Jeff: Go! At the first immunity challenge, the favorites  relied on experience, but experience wasn't enough. The first immunity  challenge is won by the fans! Facing tribal council, the favorites were split  into two alliances. <br/>Ami, Yau-Man, Jonathan and myself, the four of us are a  tight alliance, but there's another foursome out here-- Amanda and Ozzy and  Parvati and James. <br/>Jeff: And both groups wanted to recruit the same player. <br/>We need a fifth. <br/>I say Fairplay. <br/>We need Fairplay to make a strong alliance. <br/>Jeff: But Fairplay made a surprising revelation to his  surprising revelation to his tribe. tribe. <br/>Jeff: Not everyone was convinced he was telling the truth. <br/>If I know Jonny Fairplay, he is going to pull something  out of his hat that none of us are going to be expecting, and he is going to  stir things up. <br/>Jeff: But in the end, the entire tribe wrote down his  name, and severed ties with one of the most infamous players to play the  game. Jonny Fairplay, the tribe has spoken. 19 are left. 19 are left. Who  will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>I can't believe you just caught that fish with your bare  hands. <br/>I know. How awesome is that? <br/>Yes, guys, we lost Fairplay, but we did gain a fish. Maybe  that's a good omen. <br/>How awesome is it we came back and now we're eating fish? <br/>I know. A late-night snack. <br/>Well, we had tribal council tonight, and Jonny Fairplay  had asked us to vote him off. And I kept thinking something was going to  change, something was gone going to happen, something terrible-- that I was  going to be the one going home first. But we took him seriously and we  honored his request. <br/>There was just too much going on for him, which is weird,  because he seemed to be holding it together. I was not pleased when Jonny  pulled this, because it screwed up my plans. But you know what? Everybody  knows that if we can continue to do what we're doing, we should be able to  win. <br/>I'll tell you what, it is delicious. I mean, I figure that  if everyone had been out here for 30, 33, 39 days, something like that, times  nine, that's basically a year's worth of experience. We're just feeling  confident that we can go in there and beat these guys at almost any these  guys at almost any challenge. challenge.

We need  to fix our shelter. We haven't had any water. Everyone is tired. Everyone is  hungry. But at the challenge yesterday, we beat the favorites, won immunity,  and along with immunity, we also won flint, and flint is fire. So we're  golden. As soon as I light this, it's going to ignite immediately. going to  ignite immediately. <br/>Like, boom! <br/>Like, boom! <br/>Woo! <br/>Keep it going, keep it going. <br/>Keep blowing. <br/>Keep blowing. Blow more. Blow more. <br/>How much of this do we have left? <br/>We've got to make fire! I don't care how much we have! <br/>At some point, we've got to give up and say... <br/>What are they doing now with the fire? Do we know? Let's  go find out. <br/>The boys are still back there trying to start a fire.  They're all chopping away, but we've got nothing! Number one priority for me  is shelter, because pretty much every night it rains. So let's go and let's  do it. What is the problem? I don't understand. <br/>Why is everybody talking all the time and not working? <br/>Oh, this will be the worst night in the history of our  lives. <br/>We've got no shelter. Nothing. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Then let's all... can we all get in on it and start  humping it? <br/>No, they're not going to help build a shelter. They're  going to go dig for They're going to go dig for wood. wood. <br/>I just spent a half hour trying to do fire! All you do is  run your mouth. <br/>And we have not had to go to tribal council yet, and  there's drama! <br/>We can clean out that cave, shush it out with some palm  fronds, lay some down, and we can sleep clean and dry tonight. See, they're  already cleaning it out. Oh, those rat bastards. <br/>Yeah. <br/>This is exactly what we were getting ready to do. <br/>We were going to come and clean it out and put some palm  fronds down, and that was going to be home tonight. <br/>No, this is my habitat tonight. <br/>Tracy, Kathy, and Chet, I don't think they accomplished a  single productive thing all day long. And I just don't even want to be around  them, so I told them straight up, I was like, "I don't want you sleeping  in the cave." <br/>I'm not going to fight with these kids, you know? I mean,  they hate us. Come on. <br/>Tracy, Chet, and myself have pretty much been shunned by  the other people. And you can't fight seven against three. It just makes you  relive things in your life-- high school, whatever-- when you didn't fit in  and you were kind of outcast. It just kind of brings it all It just kind of  brings it all back. back. <br/>Yeah, let's do that. <br/>Yeah, let's do that. Let's grab it. Let's grab it. <br/>Oh, they took it. <br/>They just took it. <br/>Okay, okay. <br/>Okay, okay. <br/>Tell me we're not divided. <br/>Tell me we're not divided. <br/>We were quite disorganized in the last challenge, so we're  going to try to do a little better today. And we're hoping that the fans have  slept poorly and are still way behind us on the camp curve, because we're  doing great, I because we're doing great, I mean, honestly. mean, honestly. <br/>And we thought this one was big. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Right? <br/>Yeah. I'm starting to become... I'm starting to become  really attracted to Amanda. She is so cute. I mean, she's beautiful, and it's  like... oh, we've just got to stay apart as long as possible, because if it  becomes obvious to the group, then I'm going to have a giant target on my  back. I wonder if we'll get some sharks. <br/>I hope so. <br/>I hope so. <br/>Watch out. <br/>Watch out. <br/>That's the same color I found. I started off working out a  flirting angle with James, and it was just so easy because he's just so cute,  you know? <br/>What do you think, Amanda, is it love? <br/>I don't know. I definitely think that James and Parvati  have something going on. And, you know, I've always thought Ozzy was really,  really cute, and so it's kind of like a couple-y alliance, yeah. But we just  have to be careful, because I don't want it to screw because I don't want it  to screw up my game. up my game. <br/>I'm going to finally get some sleep. <br/>Well, this worked out beautiful. <br/>Imagine that. <br/>And it's solid. <br/>Kathy, Chet, and myself, we made a new shelter for the  three of us, and we're going to make it our home. <br/>I like how they did that on part of their wall. <br/>Definitely. That's a crazy covering. That's awesome. <br/>I think if we build it here and you guys have already have  yours, and we have a fire in the middle, then we can all just sit down and  just bury the hatchet. <br/>Clean that out and use the back of the tree. <br/>No, I would like you to, yes, please. <br/>The other seven, they came over and asked me to help them  build their new shelter, so I think that I've earned a little bit of respect  from them. But right now, all I care about is getting a fire, because if I  don't get some water in me, I'm going to die. <br/>We are going to get it right now. now. <br/>We are. <br/>We are. <br/>Blow, blow. <br/>Blow, blow. Keep blowing. Keep blowing. <br/>Get some little sticks in there. <br/>There we go! <br/>Yes! <br/>We made fire! Feels so good! <br/>Finally, we got fire. Now we can boil water. We actually  found some clams, so we're going to get some food in our bellies, and it's  definitely a really good feeling. <br/>Food, finally! <br/>Oh, my god! Oh! <br/>That is so good! <br/>Oh, boy! <br/>The whole dynamic of the tribe just completely turned  around. <br/>Everybody seems to kind of put their issues behind them,  and we're much more unified as a tribe. And what's that right in the middle? <br/>A ticket stub. I go to a lot of ball games and a lot of  concerts. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, my God, I love it. <br/>I'm definitely flirting with Mary, absolutely. She's a  cute girl and I'm having fun with her on the island. She's a friendly, funny  girl to get along with. I want to get Mary to trust me, and if I can use my  flirtatious ability to get her in my back pocket, then I'm going to use it.  Come here. <br/>Oh, god. <br/>Protein! Protein! <br/>Mikey, I think, really likes how Mary looks, and has  maneuvered himself pretty close to her. That's right out of, you know, Player  School 101, I think. So obviously, I'm going to keep my eyes on them. But my  priority right now is to keep my tribe strong, so I think the three  outsiders, Tracy, Chet, and Kathy, they'll be out Chet, and Kathy, they'll be  out of here as soon as possible. of here as soon as possible. <br/>I was awake quite a bit last night, and I heard the sounds  of... ...jungle love, I guess. I think we'll be receiving birth announcements  from Amanda on her little Ozzlets she's about to have. And Parvati and James  will be at the wedding as soon as this is over. So yeah, it's a little more  than just alliances there with those guys, so that's what makes it guys, so  that's what makes it scary. scary. <br/>It's silly, you know? Go get a hotel room. I mean, you've  got to take one step back and say, "There might be somebody awake."  We are sleeping together in a cave, you know. cave, you know. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>The two couples separate don't really bother me, but the  four of them together poses a problem. I don't know just yet how I'm going to  dismantle that foursome. foursome. But I'm going to try. But I'm going to  try. <br/>Okay. We have myself, Eliza, Ami, YauMan-- there's a core  four-- and we needed one more for the lock, and that was Cirie, who just told  me that she will work with me down the line if we decide to me down the line  if we decide to go that far together. go that far together. go that far  together. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! Fans getting your first look at  the new favorites tribe. Jonny Fairplay voted out at the first tribal  council. <br/>Good job, guys! Good job. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yep. <br/>Jeff: First things, first. Mary, I will take it back. <br/>I don't want to give it. <br/>Jeff: Immunity is back up for grabs. For today's  challenge, each tribe will select five swimmers, three puzzle makers, and one  keymaster. On my go, the first person will race out to a platform, climb to  the top, then smash a tile, releasing a key, dive down, retrieve the key, get  back to shore. Collect all five keys. Then the keymaster will open a chest  containing puzzle pieces. The puzzle makers will then take these pieces and  assemble a puzzle map of Micronesia. The first tribe to finish wins. Want to  know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Jeff: Winning tribe wins immunity and is safe from tribal  council. And you're playing for a reward-- fishing gear... <br/>All right! <br/>Jeff: ...as well as a bamboo fishing boat that will be  waiting for you back at camp. <br/>Oh, nice! <br/>Jeff: There's more. The winning tribe will also select one  person from the losing tribe to go to Exile Island. The bad news about Exile  Island-- you're separated from your tribe. The good news-- hidden somewhere  on Exile Island is a hidden immunity idol. Find that idol, you have power in  this game. There is one other twist in this challenge, which I will tell you  after this challenge is over. <br/>Oh, god! <br/>Jeff: It's a lot, plus immunity. Worth playing for? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: Fans, you have one extra member. Sitting somebody  out. Sitting somebody out. Who's it going to be? Who's it going to be? <br/>Okay, I guess I am. <br/>Jeff: Kathy will have a spot on the bench. I'll give you  guys a minute to strategize, we'll get started. Here we go, for immunity and reward.  Survivors ready? Survivors ready? Go! Go! Ozzy and Jason across the lily  pads. Ozzy makes it, Jason doesn't. <br/>Come on, Jason! You got it, baby, nice. <br/>Jeff: Ozzy making fast work of that swim, already at the  platform. Ozzy not even hesitating. Smashes the tile. He's in the water with  the key. Jason obliterates his tile. Ozzy has the key, and he's heading back. <br/>Yeah, Ozzy! <br/>Jeff: Jason has the key for the fans. <br/>Go, Jason! <br/>Jeff: Ozzy back. Ami now heading back out for the  favorites. Jason back with the first key for the fans. Alexis heading out  over the lily pads. Ami is on the platform. Alexis trying to close the gap. <br/>Alexis, go, go, go! <br/>Alexis, go, go, go! <br/>Go, Alexis! <br/>Go, Alexis! <br/>Jeff: Ami heading back to shore with the second key for  the favorites. Alexis has her key. <br/>Good job, Lexy, hustle it in! Great job. <br/>Jeff: Ami back with the second key. Go, Amanda. Amanda  heading out on the course. Alexis back with the second key for the fans. Chet  now on the course, takes a big fall. big fall. We are tied, two keys each. We  are tied, two keys each. Amanda at the platform, breaks a tile, and the key  is in the water. Amanda has the third key for the favorites. <br/>Watch it fall, Chet. Watch it fall. <br/>Jeff: Chet obliterates his tile. Chet cannot find the key.  Amanda back with that third key for the favorites. Parvati on the course. <br/>Chet! It's in front of you to the right! <br/>It's right there, Chet. You've got to go down, bro. <br/>Jeff: Parvati at the platform. Parvati breaks her tile.  Key is in the water. <br/>Chet, get out of the water! Let's go! Get out! <br/>Come back, come back, come <br/>Come back, come back, come back! back! <br/>Jeff: Parvati has the fourth key for the favorites. She's  heading back. <br/>Yeah, Parv! <br/>Get out of the water! Come on, man! <br/>Hustle. You've got to do this. <br/>Jeff: Parvati is back. Penner heading out, the last person  to go for the favorites. Mikey B Heading out for the fans. <br/>Let's go, Mikey! We've still got this. <br/>Jeff: Jonathan increasing the lead for the favorites. lead  for the favorites. Jonathan can't find his key. Jonathan can't find his key.  Mikey B. trying to make up some time. <br/>Jonathan, other way, other way! Right in front of you. <br/>Jeff: Mikey B. back with that third key. <br/>Let's go, Erik! Let's go, Erik. <br/>Jeff: Erik out on the course. Penner has the fifth and  final key for the favorites. <br/>Yeah, Jonathan! <br/>Jeff: Erik not giving up. <br/>Let's go, Erik. You got it! <br/>Jeff: Erik knocks his tile. Penner back with the fifth and  final key for the favorites! James starting to work on the chest. Erik has  his key. Chet's is still in the water. Five keys, five locks. James has two  locks undone. One key left in the water for the fans. You're still in this.  Jason back out to retrieve Chet's key. James now has four locks open. James  has all five open. Favorites start working on the puzzle. <br/>We've got to get the pieces out. So we can see them. <br/>Jeff: Eliza, Cirie, Yau-Man, trying to figure out the key  to this puzzle. It is a map of Micronesia. Jason heading back with the fifth  key for the fans. <br/>This one goes here. <br/>Jeff: Favorites think they're getting close. <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>Here it goes. <br/>That's it, that's it! <br/>Jeff: Favorites win immunity! <br/>Jeff: Favorites win immunity! And reward. And reward. <br/>We did it! <br/>Woo! Yes! Oh, my god! <br/>Jeff: Favorites, congratulations. <br/>Thanks! <br/>Jeff: Nobody going home from the favorites. In addition,  all this fishing gear and a bamboo fishing boat waiting for you back at camp.  One more thing to deal with-- you must now choose somebody from the tribe of  fans to send to Exile Island, and they will return to camp in the morning in  time for tribal council. <br/>Yeah. Kathy, yeah, all right. <br/>Jeff: Who's it going to be? Who are you sending to exile? <br/>The one... <br/>Kathy. <br/>...with the hat. <br/>Jeff: Kathy, before I send you on your way, we'll get to the  twist I told about. Tribe of favorites, you must now choose somebody from  your own tribe to join Kathy on Exile Island. Two people, one idol. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: You will both spend the night together on Exile. You  will both get the first clue to the location of the hidden to the location of  the hidden immunity idol. immunity idol. <br/>Cirie is going to go. <br/>Jeff: All right, Kathy and Cirie, grab your stuff. The  boat's waiting. <br/>Bye, Kathy. <br/>Bye. <br/>Bye. <br/>Jeff: Fans, nothing else for you except a date with me  tomorrow night at tribal council, where one of you will be going home. Grab  your stuff. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. <br/>Exile Island, that I never got to go to. <br/>That's right, you never got to go. <br/>Well, I'm here now. <br/>I think staying here on Exile Island with Cirie is  actually a good thing. Watching her from her season, she really grew a lot.  And she's so sweet. She's so motherly. She's right there. <br/>Let's go. We've got to move quick, because we're not going  to have a lot of we're not going to have a lot of time before it gets dark.  time before it gets dark. <br/>You've got to climb. The part about "go to the  start," they're not talking the start of our own island, are they? <br/>It can't be-- aahh! I'm thinking, let's go back. Right  now, my team is nine people. There's Parvati and those guys, and Jonathan and  those guys, and then I'm smack dab in the middle. So all I was thinking is  I'm going to Exile Island, god, please help me find the hidden immunity idol.  What? What? <br/>Why another clue? <br/>"Clue number two, continue your quest by crossing the  ocean. You've done it before, now repeat the motion." <br/>Right over there. Damn, again? <br/>Into the forest. <br/>We just came from over here and now we've got to go over  here. <br/>And we have to do it quick, because we're burning  daylight, girl. We're going to go there. <br/>Looking for the idol was <br/>Looking for the idol was absolute torture. absolute  torture. The second clue, it tells you that the third clue is across another  part of the ocean. <br/>I got it! Come here! Hurry up! It better not be another  clue. It better not be another clue. I swear to god... I swear to god... <br/>I'm just seeing those two things, looks like legs, those  two sticks. <br/>Oh, right here? <br/>I'm looking in the middle of the ocean to see two things  pop up. <br/>So then, we find the third <br/>So then, we find the third clue, back across the ocean.  clue, back across the ocean. <br/>Because it says, "You'll find <br/>Because it says, "You'll find more to this  lore." more to this lore." <br/>I've never worked so hard, <br/>I've never worked so hard, walked so far in my life.  walked so far in my life. <br/>Get to the fourth clue, back across the ocean. Oh, my god!  By the time we found the fourth clue, I was so tired and so frustrated. And  we searched and searched and searched and searched. <br/>I know, it's almost like, okay, you can come out now,  idol. We give up. <br/>We can't get this close and then not find it. then not  find it. <br/>I know. <br/>I know. <br/>We need to get some coconuts and get the shelter ready,  get ready to get some water. <br/>I think we need a round of applause for everyone today.  Because no matter what, we come together as a team, we win and together as a  team, we win and lose as a team. lose as a team. <br/>I give it to all of you that swam. <br/>It was a lot tougher. <br/>We lost our challenge today, so this is our first time  going to tribal council. I mean, that's a big deal, and we're all very  frustrated. I don't care about losing the immunity. I care about the fishing  stuff, because that box is a box of gold, you know? There was everything  there. It's most likely going to be one of the three older members of the  tribe going home, probably Chet, because he did very, very poorly in the  challenge. I mean, he was floundering around. If Chet's strength is what he  showed today, then come on. There's no discussion as far as I'm concerned.  All of us know who we want to go home. That would be Chet. But there's all  these variables that come into play which makes it difficult. Okay, and then  the girls vote Tracy. And then they're going to have their three votes versus  you, okay? So that's four to three, and Chet goes home. I'm suggesting  splitting our votes, four to Chet and three to Tracy, just in case Kathy  found the hidden immunity on Exile Island. If she had it, they can give it to  Chet or Tracy, and then if we vote them, it bounces back to us, and we're  screwed. If Kathy gives the immunity idol to Chet, us guys, us four, vote for  Tracy, and the girls, the three, vote for Kathy. <br/>Wait, wait, wait. That's in the case of what? <br/>If she gives it to Chet. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Now, the only way we can get screwed is if Kathy gave  Tracy the immunity, and then it goes to a tiebreaker. <br/>We have to stick to it. That's what I'm saying. Let's get  the final plan right now and we don't have to talk about it again. <br/>Mike is throwing out all of his different scenarios on  what if Kathy found the immunity idol on Exile Island? She already has an  immunity idol from a previous challenge, on and on and on and on, so much so  and on and on and on, so much so that it confuses me. that it confuses me. My  initial thought was, "Chet, you're out of here. You're done." But  Mikey thinks he's got it all figured out, and I don't like that. He's teamed  up with Mary, and now he thinks he has pretty much the entire tribe voting  the way he wants us to vote, and doing whatever he wants. But if I have  anything to say about that at tribal council tomorrow night, it will be  abundantly clear that that's not abundantly clear that that's not the case.  the case. <br/>Yesterday we lost the immunity challenge, so tonight we're  all going to tribal council. And Mikey seems to think that he's running the  show over here. And I just want to put a stop to And I just want to put a  stop to it. it. Mikey and Mary are very close, and I believe that if we have  one person who believes that they are leading this tribe in a certain  direction, their strongest alliance, in my mind, would be the alliance to  break. If you take away Mary, that's his closest ally. <br/>Joel suggested we, along with Alexis, work together to get  rid of Mary. And it could be a good idea. Because Mikey is a really smart  guy, and he knows what he's doing here. That's pretty diabolical, but I mean,  come on. <br/>It's what the game is, bro. <br/>It's what the game is, bro. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, that's Kathy. <br/>Yeah, that's Kathy. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Want to try to get rid of Mary and break up the Mike and  Mary and break up the Mike and Mary? Mary? <br/>Oh, my god, it's just a little tiny piece of beach, and  that's it. <br/>How was it out there? <br/>Cirie is one of the nicest people I ever met in my entire  people I ever met in my entire life. life. No, I curled up in a fetal No, I  curled up in a fetal position. position. So what's going on around here with  you guys as far as tribal with you guys as far as tribal council? council? <br/>That's all I'm telling you. Just do it. Just write it  down. <br/>I was super worried that they were all going to pick Chet,  and when I come back from Exile Island, boy, right away, Joel steps up to me  and goes, "It's Mary." I'm like, "Where did Mary come  from?" <br/>Don't spill the beans before we vote. <br/>You have to tell me what I can say and what I can't say. <br/>It's like I tell my pageant girls-- answer the question  and shut up. Don't ramble. Get off the stage. <br/>Over the last two days, it was Kathy, Chet, and myself  against the other seven. And now we finally see a window of opportunity, but  I just don't know if I can trust Joel. Joel wants this million dollars, I  think, probably more than anybody here. And I feel that he's going to stop at  nothing to get it. <br/>We've got a plan. Don't talk to anybody else about it. <br/>Joel's pulled Natalie aside, talked to her a little bit,  so we don't know really what they're talking about, but we just need to be  really honest with ourselves, and where the weaknesses lie. <br/>All of us guys vote Chet, and if she gives the immunity to  Chet, we all vote Tracy. Girls all voting Tracy. <br/>There might be a little confusion as far as our vote  tonight, but I really feel at this point I can trust Alexis, I can trust  Mike, I can trust Natalie. So I don't feel like I'm going to be voted off  anytime soon. <br/>I think it will be interesting checking out tribal council  tonight, you know, just like going there... <br/>That will be fun. <br/>If it goes as I think it will, tonight, Mary's going home.  Mikey will be completely confused as to what happened. And it will be me  running the show over here. But I've been doing a lot of running around. I've  been talking to a lot of people, and if these people are smart, I could see  them thinking, "He's too powerful, he's too manipulative," and  being very leery of me. But either way, I think on my But either way, I think  on my feet, so we'll see what happens. feet, so we'll see what happens. <br/>Jeff: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a  torch, approach the flame, dip it in approach the flame, dip it in and get  fire. and get fire. This is part of the ritual of tribal council because in  this game, fire represents your life. As long as you have fire, you're still  in the game. When your fire is gone, so are you. So let's start at the  beginning. Kathy, right off the bat, one person from each tribe got an  immunity idol. How did you end up with it for your tribe? <br/>I came in last, and Yau-Man pointed out that my idol was  under the boat, so I picked it up. I picked it up and went, "Is this  it?" <br/>Jeff: The idol you have is only good tonight, which means  you can use it for yourself and stay protected, or you can give it to  somebody before we vote. So you're clear on how that plays tonight. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Let's talk about the challenge. Chet, this challenge  for you was extremely difficult. You were exhausted before you got halfway  out to the platform. <br/>Actually, I really wasn't exhausted. I thought it was best  to come back in and let somebody else go back out, because I felt I was  wasting too much time out there. <br/>Jeff: With all due respect, that's giving yourself a  little more credit than I would. It took you forever to go back to the beach. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: What's going through your head as you feel the  pressure of nine other people going... <br/>Obviously it was a lot of pressure, but it was what it  was. And I would have it liked to have been better, but it wasn't. It didn't  turn out that way. <br/>Jeff: Mikey B. <br/>I think the most frustrating thing about Chet struggling  was, if you're not that good of a swimmer, why are you not making a team move  and step down? I mean, I was really irked by it, to be honest with you. <br/>Jeff: Tracy, tell me about camp life. <br/>It's aggravating. We have a lot of conflicts. The older  people kind of went one way, and the younger group kind of went the other.  And you just sort of get a little, you know, chafed by it, and you say,  "I'm either going to sit back and whine about it, or I'm going to get  up, and take care of myself." <br/>Jeff: Natalie, do you see people grouping together because  they just get along better? <br/>Absolutely. I feel that some people have been segregated,  and now we have two shelters, so clearly there are people that get along and  people that don't get along. <br/>Jeff: Alexis, two shelters? This doesn't sound good. <br/>There was a certain division, and two shelters have been  built, one shelter housing Tracy, Chet, and Kathy. So yeah, I mean, there's  definitely some conflict there. <br/>Jeff: Chet, you've got to be a little concerned tonight.  There are seven people in one shelter, and you three are sitting over there  by yourself. <br/>Sure, it looks bad that it's three against seven. It's  really out of my control at this point. People have to vote how they have to  vote. <br/>Jeff: Erik, would you be concerned if you were Chet? <br/>I would be very, very concerned. I mean, he's outside of  the numbers. He's not as physically fit. I would be very, very, very scared. <br/>Jeff: Mary, let's talk about alliances, or friendships  that might be alliances. <br/>Sure, you can see people going their different directions,  and alliances forming, but I feel pretty secure right now with my position in  the tribe and with the people that I choose to communicate with and be  friends with. <br/>Jeff: Joel, what do you base a vote on this early in the  game? You barely know these people. <br/>I have a conscience, I swear, but I don't care if anybody  goes home. I mean, I barely know these people, and I don't put it past a  single one of them to vote me off tonight. It's a game of loyalty and it's a  game of deception, and anybody can go at any time. And you'll never know who  it is. <br/>Jeff: All right, on that note, let's get to the vote.  Kathy, you have your immunity idol. It has to play tonight. <br/>I'll keep it for myself. <br/>Jeff: Kathy's immune. You cannot vote for Kathy. Everybody  else is fair game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Erik, you're up.  Erik, you're up. <br/>Chet, you blew it with your body, your brains, and your  heart.

Kathy, you can leave that idol behind.

I'm just totally blindsided.  Not even a clue that I was going to be going home tonight. So it kind of  sucks being the first person to go off your tribe, but maybe they you saw me  getting too close to some individuals and making friends with others. I'm  definitely rooting for the fans. They're all very strong individuals, and one  of the fans will definitely win this will definitely win this Survivor.
