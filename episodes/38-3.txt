<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor": At the karma  tribe all eyes were on the returning players. <br/>They've had their moment to shine. It's our chance. <br/>Joe and I are under a magnifying glass. <br/>Jeff: Another returning player was being targeted. <br/>I'm all about blindsiding Wentworth. I think that's a great idea. <br/>Jeff: And Chris wanted to bring in war dog. <br/>Now would be a really good time to make a move on Wentworth. <br/>Jeff: But war dog had his own agenda. <br/>It's got to be Keith. <br/>How is Keith in the game helping the war dog out? And the answer is, he is not. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Keith was voted out. Keith, the tribe has spoken. <br/>God! <br/>Jeff: And had a decision to make. <br/>My God. <br/>Jeff: Go home or grab the torch and go to the Edge of  Extinction. <br/>Come on, God. Come on. Captioning funded by cbs  Keith! They sent you away! <br/>Reem! Aaaah! <br/>Oh, man! <br/>I'm so sorry. <br/>No, dude. <br/>I'm sorry. <br/>Don't be sorry. <br/>This is insane. This is actually insane. I'm scared out of my mind. It's dark. It's freaking dark. You literally cannot see in fRont of you. <br/>Keith, it's rough out here. I'm going to tell you straight up. It's really rough out here. I haven't eaten in days, man. <br/>Are you serious? <br/>Yes. <br/>I definitely want to get sleep tonight. [ laughs ]. <br/>It's an emotional roller coaster out here. And knowing all of that, I feel now responsible for Keith. <br/>I definitely want to get some food. <br/>There is no food here. You gotta get it yourself. I was ready to raise that mast, but now, I'm in that  "Motherly" role and I hate to leave him alone. I have to stay to make sure he's okay. I have to stay to make sure he's okay. <br/>There's something. Ing this' up. <br/>Oh, there's new things. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>"Keith" and "Reem."  This freaking game, bro. <br/>Wow! It's a map. <br/>Mast. Wreck. Steps? It says that there's these stairs. I have no idea where they are, which is interesting because I've  kind of scoured this beach, I thought. But I didn't see anything. I mean, granted, this island is huge. It's exhausting. Oh! Do you see anything? <br/>No. There's no step paths. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>I don't know how far I need to go or if I'm just wandering  endlessly. It's difficult because this island is huge. But then, I see the steps. We're at the steps. <br/>Are we? <br/>Without a doubt. Probli'm tired. <br/>Something's in there. <br/>It's rice! Thank God! <br/>Yay! <br/>Hala-freaking-lula. Oh, my God. <br/>This is hardly any rice. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Damn it! <br/>That freaking note says, "You have to work hard for  everyth everything." we have to do this every day. Apparently, every time we've got to climb up mount everest to  find a little bit of rice. This sucks! <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! Kama getting your first look at the new Manu tribe. Keith voted out at the last tribal council. All right, for today's challenge, you're going to race to  assemble a wheelbarrow. You'll push is through a series of obstacles collecting  sandbags. You'll then dump the sandbags into a trough, take the  wheelbarrow apart, and use the pieces to build a slickshot. You'll use the slingshot to fire sandbacks at targets. The first tribe to knock down all four targets wins reward. You want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: Once again you have a choice. You can choose between: Comfort. Or... [ clucking ]. <br/>Jeff: You got it. Chickens. <br/>Wow! <br/>I love chickens. <br/>Jeff: Three hens, one rooster. Big choice. Cam ayKama, you have two extra p sitting two out. Who is it going to be? Everybody else gets a minute to strategize. We'll get started. It's going to be fun. All right, here we go. For reward. Survivors ready? Go! [ applause ]  Jeff: The first thing you have to do is assemble the  wheelbarrow. That's going to take team work, good communication. Manu quickly working together to get the wheel and the axle in. Kama now has their wheel in. David guiding them. <br/>Keep going! Let's go! <br/>Jeff: It's Manu out of the gate first. The trib who has yet to win a challenge this season. <br/>This thing is heavy. <br/>Reporter: Kama now right on their tail. It is erik, Julie, and Joe for Kama. It is David, devon, and war dog for Manu. <br/>Get out of here! <br/>Back up, guys! Guys! <br/>Jeff: You've got to get in there! There you go! Now you're good! Now you're untying knots trying to release that first batch of  sandbags. Kama untied their knots a lot faster. Kama is now in the lead. Manu now has their sandbags. They're trying get out of here. <br/>You got it? <br/>Jeff: Erik, Julie, and Joe doing a nice job of maneuvering  their wheelbarrow. It is heavy. It is awkward. Nothing about it is easy. Kama now wheeling into that second batch of sandbags. You're good. Devon, David, and war dog doing everything they can to get bag  back. You're good! Kama has their second batch of sandbags. <br/>Get in! Get in! Get in! <br/>Jeff:you have to get them all in that truck. You can't help. Manu has their second batch of sandbags. You're good, Kama! The challenge now turns over to the next four-- Aurora, Gavin, Julia,  and Victoria. <br/>Turn it this way. <br/>Jeff: They have to take it apart and build a slingshot. Manu has to toss by hand, taking more time. You've got to get them all in there. Manu continues to struggle at every stage of every challenge. You're getgood! Get out of there, guys. It is now a race to disassemble the wheelbarrow and build a  slingshot. <br/>Good job. Good job. <br/>Jeff: Kama struggling to get it in. Something is not lining up. And here comes Manu now. You will know when it's in. It will seat very nicely. Manu's goes right in. You're good! It is now Manu in the lead. Kama struggling it get this slingshot to line up. Now they're good. Once again, Chris is in the hero role. Can he get it done this time? And he does. Manu has their first. It's going to be Gavin for Kama and Chris for Manu. There are four targets. You've got to knock down all four. Gavin just misses. Chris hits the second target for Manu! Manu has half their targets down, only two lift. Gavin going to step out. Here comes Julia to give it a go. Big reward on the line. Julia knocks the first target down for Kama. She's going to go again. It is 2-1. <br/>You got it. <br/>Jeff: Chris back. And he's got the third target. One target left. <br/>One more! <br/>Jeff: Julie just misses on the second. Chris could win it right here. <br/>Love it, Chris, love it. <br/>Chris, don't mis. <br/>Jeff: And he does! Manu wins reward, their first challenge of the season! <br/>Good job, everybody. <br/>We needed that win. <br/>Jeff: Manu, first win of the season. It's a big one. What's it going to be, comfort or chickens? <br/>Chicken. <br/>Chicken. <br/>Jeff: All right, Manu, chickens will be waiting for you  back at camp. Grab your stuff, head back to camp, and enjoy your best victory. Cam ai got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>We should be happy. It's our first win. But suddenly, my ankle started throbbing when I was leaving the  challenge, and I looked down and it was really tender, and it started looking  swollen, and now I can't even move it. It keeps getting worse. <br/>Where do you want to go? <br/>I don't care. Just drop me wherever. In the second part of the challenge we had to disassemble the  wheelbarrow and I lifted up a pin and it fell on my ankle. I was so focused on the challenge I thought I'll worry about it  later. It hurt and I just pulled my foot out, and I got the wheel out,  and we ran to finish. And I didn't notice. It was hurting but not this bad. As I'm walking to camp, I guess I calmed down or something, and  it just started throbbing and progressively got worse and worse. And I'm just, like, worried because I've never broken anything. I don't know. Like, I just eye just don't want this to be serious. <br/>Seriously, if you need anything, call us. We'll grab it for you. Okay? <br/>Let's give her some space. <br/>I would like to look at our beautiful chickens. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>No, he's going to be dead. <br/>The chickens, we can eat the chickens before our most  important immunity challenge. <br/>I'm so pumped. Rotisserie chicken sounds amazing, doesn't it? <br/>All I have to do is sit here in pain and listen to what  they're going to do to these chickens and it's so upsetting. I'm just like, poor chickens. What did they do to the players? Like, the players signed up for the game not the chickens. So why should they be penalized. <br/>It takes a couple of hours to kill it, pluck it. <br/>Who is killing the chicken? <br/>Oh, God. <br/>There's no way I'm killing anything. <br/>If they're going to lay eggs, that's awesome, that's why  we shouldn't kill them all. <br/>Coming into this game, I always said, if my tribe were to  win chickens, I would release the chickens. But how-- how would I be able to do it with this busted ankle. <br/>I think they're going to get at least one. Not today. <br/>Did the chickens do? <br/>You eat chicken back home, though, right? We're bleeding heart hypocrites. <br/>These chickens don't deserve to die. <br/>I'm with you. <br/>Convince them not to kill the chickens then to prove it. <br/>I'm not I setting the chicken free. <br/>I wouldn't tell on you. But I think it would come back to haunt you. <br/>I need an accomplice. <br/>--I-- I count my out. Count me out. It was probably the most surprising part of my game so far when Wendy  asked me to be an accomplice in a jail break. She wants to set chickens free. She's literally willing to sacrifice her entire game of  "Survivor" to save these chickens. I don't think I've ever met anyone like wend pep she's a  lovable, emotional nut. <br/>We lost the reward challenge today, which kind of sucks. But we haven't lost an immunity challenge yet. We haven't had to go to tribal yet. And that's way more important. <br/>You were so great. They got lucky. Whatever. <br/>We're all still here. That's all that matters. Let's rest tonight and let's crush them tomorrow. <br/>I have found myself in a group of six-- me, Julie, Julia, Gavin,  Ron, and erik. Which makes a lot of sense because there's a general feeling on  the tribe that returning players have played before. They've had their shot. This is our first chance, and we should get to play before they  do. Joe and Aubry are a target, and Aurora is the only one who seems  1,000% on board with the returning players. So if we were to lose the next immunity and we had to go to  tribal I think one of them's got to go. <br/>Hoare you feeling about everything? <br/>About? <br/>If we lose a challenge? <br/>I feel like if we lose, we've got six of us. It's a matter of deciding which one of the three you want to  vote out. <br/>In Joe and Aubry kind of come as a pair. <br/>They do. <br/>What do we do? <br/>You and Aubry are a pair? <br/>I mean, we are kind of on the bottom of the barrel. <br/>I don't think there is a barrel. <br/>I mean overall like, you know, what I mean. Of all the people playing in the game. <br/>Oh, my God. Joe is over there, and I had no idea! <br/>You guys feel good? I mean, obviously, we can tell that you guys are all kind of  talking amongst yourselves and trying to figure it out, and me and her, we're  getting nervous. I feel like I just can't get a read on Victoria and Ron because  you ask them kind of what they're thinking, and they only give you nothing. So I have a funny feeling that I might be on the chopping block. So do you guys feel good? <br/>Yup. <br/>Okay. <br/>I mean, it's very clear. <br/>Yeah, I got super weird vibes? <br/> Same. <br/>Okay. <br/>I think Joe is looking for redemption, just like I am, and  we are scared coming into this new group of players. <br/>I guess this is the point in the game now where--  At least we're seeing what people's true colors are. <br/>I think returnees are an easy target. So I feel like I do need the idol. I'm looking for the idol. I'm looking high, low, in trees. I dig up around tree mail, digging on the side of the path. Looking in trees. I mean, it's something I've dreamed about my entire  "Survivor" experience. I feel like it's in here. I've done nearly everything in "Survivor," except win  and get a hidden immunity idol. And I know how hard it is to win, and I'm here to win. But first I need to check one more thing off my  "Survivor" checklist. I want every experience on "Survivor," and that's one  I haven't had. So I keep looking. There's something here. Anything I can see to find the idol. [ crying ] can the congratulations! You have found the hidden immunity idol." I find the idol,  and I break down in tears. I never-- I never thought I'd find one. And I've been through so much in "Survivor," and this  is something that I haven't gotten yet. I'm so proud of myself. It's worth the effort to work through the struggle. And I love this game so much. I'm going to make it work for me. [ clucking ]. <br/>All creatures scerve to live. <br/>Do you eat meat at all? <br/>If you were to kill the animal, I wouldn't. <br/>You can eat it from the store but you wouldn't if somebody  else did it. <br/>They're dead already, but they're actually treated worse. <br/>We need to try to win this game, and to win this game we  need strength. <br/>Wendy is losing her mind. Back home she eats chicken and pork and meat and all that. She's like, "I know I'm hypocrital." I said,  "Absolutely right, you're hip kittal."  But we're not. If you can so help tyou can be a vegetarian. You're going to be a vegetarian? <br/>Yes. <br/>All right. Even when she's on the losing side of an argument, she's so  stubborn to the point she said she's going to be a vegetarian. Wendy, mark my words, the minute I find out you have one piece  of meat in your belly just don't talk to me again. She's lost her rocker. <br/>You want to kill it, fine. Whatever. I'll kill it. But do not sit on your high horse and tell me that we can't eat  that chicken. <br/>Doesn't she eat chicken back home? <br/>Chicken you eat at home comes from a worse place than  here  It's ridiculous. <br/>If this tribe loses again, I would want to target Wendy  because Wendy does not want to kill the chickens. She had to be carried into camp because her ankle is so bad, and  on top of that, I saw one vote at tribal for me, and that was from Wendy. There is one thing I wanted to tell you guys. At some point, people-- sometime it's better to stick together. I don't know. <br/>We've got four right here, right? <br/>I mean, if you're coming after me, I have to get you  before you get me. It's kill or be killed. If you come after me, like, I mean, watch out. <br/>Jeff: Okay, you guys ready to get to today's immunity  challenge? <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: First things first, Julie, got to take back the  idol. Oh! Oh! <br/>We noticed. <br/>Watch out. <br/>Jeff: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, three tribe members will be in a boat. The other four tribe members will be tethered to the boat. On my "Go," those four will dive in, begin swimming  and put boat to a tall tower. Wowns reach the tower, the tribe members in the boat, will climb  up, leap off, and grab a key. Once you have all three keys, you'll use them to unlock a chest. Inside the chess, puzzle piece. Use the puzzle pieces to solve a chip's wheel. First tribe to spin their wheel, raise their flag, wins  immunity, safe from the vote. Losers, tribal council, where somebody will become the third  person voted out of "Survivor: Edge of Extinction." Kama, you have  two extra players. You're going to sit two out. Victoria, Julia will sit out. Give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right, here we go. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! Brand-new "Survivor" challenge. Four members of each tribe will swim literally pulling their  other tribe members in a boat. You are trying to get them to that tower. <br/>Come on, guys! Let's go! Let's go! <br/>Good job, guys! <br/>Jeff: Out of the gate, we are dead even. <br/>You're doing great! <br/>Jeff: That is what you call team work right there. Wendy, even with a bad ankle, very good in the water. We are neck and neck right now. You've got to get to the ring. That will line up the boat. <br/>Go, go, go! Go! <br/>Wait, wait! <br/>Jeff: It's going to be David heading up. Kama is there. There goes Gavin. Gavin has the key for Kama. He's got to get back. David has the key for Manu. He's got to get back. You're good! Go, Wentworth! <br/>Gotta get in the boat. <br/>Jeff: You're good, go, Julia. Wentworth now out on the beam looking for that second key. Kelley has hers. Julia has it. She's in the water. Go, Lauren! <br/>Go, go! <br/>Jeff: Manu in the lead right now. Lauren has the third key. GAubry! Aubry heading for her third and final key. Start swimming in. Aubry with the third key for Kama. She's got to get back to the boat. You're good! Go! Kama trying to get back in this. You're good, Manu. Get up! <br/>Get up that ladder. Let's go, guys. <br/>Jeff: Kama trying to stay close. Manu still in the lead now. They have won only one challenge this season. Here comes Kama. Gotta get everybody here. You're good. Go, Aubry. It is David on the keys for Manu. He's got that chest open. There are three sets of pieces. You're solving that one first. Kama now has their chest open. They can start working on the wheel. The first bag are the spokes. You have to figure out which pieces go together so that they fit  in perfectly. This is a puzzle in the form of a ship's wheel. Manu won the last challenge for reward. They have yet to win an immunity challenge. <br/>No, this isn't long enough, right? <br/>Yes, it is. It works. <br/>Jeff: It's all about communication. <br/>Perfect. <br/>Where does this one go? <br/>Jeff: Kama quickly back in this. They think they have the spokes together. <br/>Good job, Kama! <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>Jeff: Kama moving on to bag number two. They've got their spokes put together. It's now Manu who is struggling. <br/>It's not going to work. <br/>This one, this one! Come on! You look at it and you tell me what to do. <br/>Jeff: The two veterans, David and Wentworth, struggling on  this puzzle and they have given up the lead. They are absolutely nowhere with the spokes. <br/>Those don't go together. <br/>I know. <br/>This can't go here. Why is this on here? <br/>Jeff: Immunity on the line. Kama has a big lead right now, and they know it. Kama moving on to that third and final section. Where they put the handles in. <br/>Okay, okay. <br/>Go, go! <br/>Jeff: Manu is wRong again! Wow! Kama thinks they have it. For the win. <br/>Woooo! <br/>Jeff: Kama wins immunity sending Manu back to tribal  council. <br/>Sorry. <br/>Sorry, guys. <br/>Puzzles are hard. Puzzles are hard. <br/>Jeff: Kama, for the third straight time, immunity yours. Nobody going home from your tribe. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Enjoy another night off. Once again, Manu, tribal council, somebody will be the third person  voted out of this game. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>Losing the immunity challenge was incredibly devastating,  but I've always been wanting to target Wentworth, and I think people are  going to be really focused on Wendy. So I have a real opportunity to take out Wentworth. I trust my "Survivor" instincts. It's telling me right now target Wentworth. <br/>Going into today's immunity Going into today's immunity challenge, I'm injured, and I  still killed it. I feel like dithe best I could have done. <br/>I'm really sorry, guys. <br/>No, no. I'm sorry. You guys have nothing to be sorry about. <br/>I'm bummed because I know all eyes are on me at the moment  and I feel like tonight I'm going home. <br/>This is the lowest of low so far. <br/>I just want to cook the chicken for us. Are you guys okay with that? <br/>I'm okay with it. <br/>You don't have to convince me to kill a chicken. <br/>If it's up to me tonight, they're not eating that chicken. <br/>Ready to do that thing. I have to find my flint. Where is the flint? <br/>The flint is on the...  Don't do it to me, all. Don't do it to me. <br/>It's supposed to go there. <br/>Dude, I'm the last one that started it. And it was in that area. <br/>You think you left it in this area? <br/>I did not touch it from here. <br/>I would wait to kill the chicken? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Where's Wendy at? <br/>She walked off. <br/>She walked off? <br/>Down the beach. <br/>Do you think she took it to save her chicken? <br/>No, that would be insane. <br/>That would be psychotic. <br/>I took their flint. <br/>I'm sure it's around here. <br/>Being the smatter I am, I thought they can't cook a  chicken without fire. And they can't make a fire without flint. <br/>Is there any possibility that webdy took it? <br/>She was up to the camp while we were all talking and as  soon as we were done, she runs away. <br/>She did actually come to camp. <br/>Would you mind asking her, dude? <br/>Should I be the one. <br/>Just ask her. , "Girl, do you have the flint?"  I'll go with you. <br/>The flint, it disappeared, and there's this theory  floating around that maybe Wendy took it because she's been against us  cooking the chicken. Strategy here. <br/>Approaching her. <br/>How are you? <br/>I'll let you approach, and I'll just kind of-- at the  right time I'll come in like bad cop. <br/>Everyone is losing their mind because of the flint. They're probably going to want to vote out Wendy because of the  chicken debate but I want to take out Wentworth. <br/>You may get your wish about the chicken. We actually can't seem to find the flint. You haven't seen it lying around, have you? <br/>Chris had it. <br/>Yeah, Chris had it, and he doesn't know where he put it. <br/>He had it this morning. <br/>How do you feel, talking shop a little bit about tonight. <br/>Let's say I were to be going home today. <br/>You may not go home. <br/>What are you thinking right now? <br/>It would be cool to make a big move. <br/>It's got to be Kelley. <br/>Right. <br/>But ift requires some conversations --  You guys go ahead, and I'm sorry-- don't think I'm  sulking. <br/>Wendy is absolutely the best smoke screen. She has delivered on a silver platter, vote me out. <br/>We'll get the fire going. <br/>Did you find it. <br/>She didn't take it. <br/>She did not. <br/>No. <br/>I don't, so. <br/>Where is it. <br/>David, it's still Wendy. <br/>Yeah, yeah. I don't want to vote out Wendy. I think Wendy is someone I can use. She's loyal to me. She'll vote with me I think every time. <br/>You want to kill the chicken? <br/>Yeah. <br/>What we really want is to send Kelley home. Kelley Wentworth needs to go home. And now, it's a matter of pulling over Chris. <br/>What do you want to do tonight? <br/>I think the safest thing to do is Wentworth. <br/>Wentworth? <br/>Yeah. Don't say anything to Lauren or war dog. <br/>I think war dog would be a number. <br/>I'm going to be honest with you. I think-- I really believe in my heart of hearts if you tell war  dog what we're doing tonight, this entire thing blows apart. Kelley is not going home. He's in much tighter with her than anybody knows. <br/>Wentworth, she's too good to keep around. The problem si'm in pretty close with war dog, and David wants  it to be just us four. But back home in my real life, I'm someone who is open with  everybody. So my biggest fear is that I burn bridges with some of the  relationships I've built out here. Just to prepare for tonight. <br/>Yeah. <br/>What are you thinking? <br/>I mean, Wendy. <br/>Is it? <br/>What do you think? I mean, talk to me. Do you have another idea? We could brainstorm now. <br/>Yeah. I think it's either going to be Wendy or Wentworth. She plays this game kind of like a snake, dude. <br/>I'll go with what you want to do. Wendy shouldn't obvious vote tonight. Wendy's got a hurt ankle. Wendy doesn't want anything to do with any of the chickens. But Chris approached me for the second time to keep options over  to take out Wentworth. I trust Wentworth more than Chris. I decide maybe it's not Wendy or Wentworth. Maybe it's Chris. <br/>Chris, he's out to get you. This guy's a problem. I want him out. This guy--  What votes do we have? It's basically four-three, right. <br/>I just have to get Rick and we have to keep it shush. <br/>Tell me what Rick says. <br/>What do we do with this guy? <br/>Get him out. So Chris is coming after me now, saying my name and trying  potentially put this plan together to get me out. That's not going to work for me. If you're coming for me, like, you have to go. No more Wendy. Vote Chris. <br/>Look, here's the deal, Chris says leave open the  possibility that maybe we take Wentworth out tonight. <br/>Did you already talk to her about this? <br/>I talked to her first. I want to talk to you first. I don't want to bring David in. I don't want to bring Wendy in. If you're in, we both talk to Lauren and make it happen and take  one of the big threats out of this game. <br/>Oh, crap. War dog wants to get Chris out, because Chris is going after Kelley  which I'm like oh, [bleep]. I'm glad he doesn't know I've been going after Kelley. It would be you, me, Lauren and Kelley? <br/>Yeah, four-three. <br/>I don't want to alienate David because, like, I do think  he's a number for you and I. <br/>If you're in with this plan, I'm in with you talking to David. <br/>I've been waiting all game to make a big move. Apparently today is the day for big moves. It sucks because now it's all coming to a head, and I'm getting  pushed into a corner where I'm gog have to betray someone. I'm a villain now. I've been turned into a villain. <br/>She wasn't ever supposed to know her name was coming up. And now she does. So--  He played himself. We weren't going to approach Wardog. <br/>We have a lot to talk about. Oh, my God, now it looks like Wendy isn't even an option to vote  for anymore, which was a simple vote. Now it's become a vote between Wentworth and Chris. <br/>It sounds like we have our way. <br/>We do. What do you think? <br/>Wardog paint aid very pretty picture of Kelley's loyalty. <br/>Here she comes. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Now Rick and I find ourselveses in the middle. Whatever name Rick and I land on--  I've been brought up to speed. <br/>Oh, okay. <br/>...That is who should be going home tonight. <br/>David, I don't trust anybody. <br/>On one hand it's good to vote for Wentworth, because she's  the person I least trust in this game. But funny thing is, if I vote Chris out, no one in the game  would know that I'm the one coming after Wentworth. No matter what, tonight's tribal council is going to be huge. Secrets are going to get exposed. Betrails are going to get exposed. And I think nobody is gog view any of those betrails kindly or  quietly. <br/>Jeff: So , if you were watching at home how would you  judge this tribe? <br/>Losers. We have three immunities and one win we end up with an injured  player. <br/>Don't forget about the flint. <br/>We lost the flint in camp today. <br/>And arguing over the chickens. It was a disaster. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, what was the argument about the chickens? <br/>Wendy decided that she would not eat a chicken if we  killed it. <br/>I mean, I didn't feel like it was much of an argument. It wasn't like, "I'm going to cause chaos if you guys kill  a chicken." it was basically, "I don't feel comfortable. I'll step aside."  Jeff: Wardog, is that your take on it? <br/>She eats chicken back home with no problem. She said, you're right. I'm going to be a vegetarian now. How is that? It's almost like talking to myself. She has a lot of Wardog in her. <br/>Warpup. <br/>Technically I have been vegetarian for eight days now, so  I'm that stubborn. <br/>Jeff: So, Devens, when you lose one after another after  another, there's a point where it might just become I have to kick into game  mode. I can't worry anymore about the tribe. <br/>The first two tribals was based on we need to get stRonger  and it's not working. So you have to re-evaluate, and I think a lot of people had that  running through their minds today. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth, did you feel a shift after today's loss,  three this a row. Something has to change. <br/>We're obviously doing something long and it's coming down  to loyalty. As we get smaller and smaller and that you recall, you're going  to have to trust the people you're with. <br/>Jeff: David, it's an interesting ideal if a tribe were to  give up on itself and lts ability to win, then somebody who is slowing you  down in challenges isn't as big a problem. <br/>Well, that's, I think, exactly what's going to happen  tonight. So whether or not someone is a liability in a challenge is  irrelevant. I think that tonight is really about eliminating the biggest  social threat. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth, that seemed to get your attention. <br/>Yeah, I mean-- there could be multiple plans going on. I'm not sure. Uhm...  Jeff: I rarely see you being unable to answer. <br/>I'm trying to process what David said. <br/>Don't worry --  Yeah, don't worry about it. He's just talking. Wardog, what do you make of David's comments? <br/>A lot of his comments kind of throw me a little bit off  balance, to be honest. I'm sticking to my plan. And I think cohesion is the best way forward. <br/>Jeff: Wendy, when you hear this comment from David, does  it make gu, "Oh, maybe there's more game afoot?"  Honestly, whatever happens in tribal council, I always  feel like the tribe is a pyramid of different layers and I'm right at the  bottom. I'm just extracting all my information from what's happening  right now. <br/>Jeff: Wow. Devens, this is fascinating! A tribe that seems to have nothing going on but loss after loss  after loss right now seems to be playing a very complex, layered game, only  eight days in. <br/>I hope this can be our advantage because Kama hasn't done  any of this, and we have three days of pure strategy under our belt right now  so we're playing a much more developed game. <br/>I think just coming out here, you don't realize how good  these players are. Like, these are real conversations. These are real relationships. These are real people. And that's something that you can't feel back home. <br/>Jeff: All right, it is time to vote. Lauren, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Jeff: If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want  to play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. First vote, Wentworth. Chris. Wentworth. That's two votes Wentworth. Chris. We're tied, two votes Wentworth, two votes Chris. Chris. That's three votes Chris, two votes Wentworth. Third person voted out of "Survivor," Chris. That's four. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Jeff: Chris, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. <br/>Screw those guys. I'm getting back in the boat.

Everybody, drop your buffs. <br/>Now we have to cannibalize ourselves. <br/>Jeff: We are switching from two tribes to three tribes. <br/>It's a whole new dynamic now. <br/>I just got lied to my face. Tomorrow it's going to be motivation and refocus. Tonight it's painful. Something in my stomach hurts. I didn't see the blindside coming. This is a blindside inside of a blindside but it's a redeeming  blindside. I've been given a second chance and I'm going to mieskt of it. Screw those guys. I'm coming back for you.
