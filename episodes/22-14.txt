<br/>Episode 14 -  <br/>Jeff: Exactly one year ago, at the finale of  "Survivor: heroes versus villains" Boston Rob challenged Russell to  a rematch. <br/>Given the opportunity, I'd gladly go back and kick your  ass all over the island. <br/>Let's make it happen. <br/>Jeff: This season they got their wish. Boston Rob and Russell...  Oh, no. <br/>Jeff: ...Returned to face each other in the latest  evolution of "Survivor." Redemption Island. This time around, Boston Rob, a notorious double dealer, tried  something new-- loyalty. He made an alliance of six Ometepe members and stayed with them  until the end. <br/>That's it. This is us. <br/>Jeff: There was Grant, his right-hand man. Natalie, the youngest player in "Survivor" history. Andrea, the hardworking farm girl. Ashley, the nurse who's lately proven to be a threat in  challenges. Once again, Ashley, like she grew up doing it. And the always-unpredictable Phillip. Did you have a collision with a hawk? <br/>I had asked for a sign, and out of thin air appeared this  feather. <br/>Jeff: with his army intact, Rob further strengthened his  position when he found the hidden immunity idol. <br/>Yeah, baby, maybe I learned something since last time. <br/>Jeff: he then kept it secret for the rest game. Anyone not in Rob's alliance was fair game. Rob saw Matt's relationship with Andrea as a threat. <br/>I know how strong a pair can be in this game. <br/>Jeff: So he blindsided Matt and sent him to Redemption  Island. You will have a second shot to get back in this game. At the first redemption duel... Matt has all three keys! ...Matt beat Francesca... Matt stays alive! ...And earned the right to stay at Redemption Island in hopes of  rejoining the game. There he spent time alone. <br/>God has literally been carrying me. <br/>Jeff: his only true alliance was with his god. At the Zapatera tribe...  Where is the idol? <br/>Jeff: ...Russell was up to his old tricks, looking for  hidden immunity idols and making an alliance with the youngest girls on the  tribe. <br/>Krista and Stephanie, my two girls. <br/>Jeff: But the rest of the tribe had a few tricks of their  own. <br/>Jeff: They decided to throw a challenge. Ometepe has this nailed. Julie misses. <br/>Come on, guys, come on. <br/>Jeff: Steve seems to be wearing out. Ometepe wins their first challenge! [ cheers and applause ]  Every single one of them let the challenge go. I'm dealing with a bunch of bitches. <br/>Jeff: And they voted out Russell. The tribe has spoken. At Redemption Island, Russell squared off against Matt in an  epic battle of good versus evil. <br/>This is it. <br/>Jeff: Matt going to give it a go. Will it make it? Matt stays alive! And in his last moment in the game, Russell showed that he had a  heart and made a promise. <br/>This is my last time playing this game. That's it. I have nothing else to prove. <br/>Jeff: Matt won every subsequent duel. Matt stays alive! And earned his way back into the game. Matt seizes the moment and will re-enter this game. The tribes were then merged. With Ometepe at six...  Ometepe! <br/>Jeff: ...Zapatera with five, and Matt stuck in the middle. <br/>I want to be in this game as long as I can so I'm really  just trying to figure out what's best for me and which route to take. <br/>Jeff: he quickly reestablished his relationship with Andrea. <br/>This is what I want-- I want to take out the Ometepe  tribe. <br/>Jeff: But Andrea had seen what happened when you crossed Rob. Eighth person voted out of "Survivor: Redemption Island."  so they blindsided Matt for a second time. Sending him right back to Redemption Island. <br/>What the hell, guys? <br/>Jeff: Every single member of the former Zapatera tribe  followed Matt to Redemption Island, where the duels became battles between  multiple people, and Mike and Matt went on a winning streak. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: Mike and Matt stay alive on Redemption Island! While the rest became members of the jury. With only former Ometepe members left to vote out, Phillip was  an obvious target. <br/>Hey! <br/>Jeff: his personality was getting on everyone's nerves. <br/>The thing about me, you open up a can of [ bleep ] I will  get right in there with you and drag you down in it. <br/>Get out of our faces! <br/>Jeff: But in the end, Rob decided who was in and who was  out. <br/>One man should not have this much power in this game. Luckily, I'm not an ordinary man. <br/>Jeff: And Andrea found out the hard way...  I feel like I'm trusting the right people. <br/>Jeff: ...She was out. Andrea. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Jeff: well, that's one blindside. I have a feeling it won't be the last. Grant also believed his alliance with Rob was rock solid. <br/>The only person that I really truly trust out here is Rob  completely, wholeheartedly. <br/>Jeff: But Rob had other ideas. <br/>I didn't come to this game to make friends. I came to this game to win so I got to vote your ass off  tonight. <br/>Jeff: And Grant became the final person sent to Redemption  Island. You'll have a chance to get back in this game. <br/>I'm not done. See you guys shortly. <br/>Jeff: Tonight marks the end of this epic season of  "Survivor." will Rob complete the journey he began nearly a decade  ago? <br/>I feel like right now, I'm playing my best game, but even  everything that's happened up until right now means nothing unless I can  finish it. <br/>Jeff: Or will his loyal soldiers turn on him? <br/>Natalie and I, you know, we've stuck together since the  beginning, and we could band together and make a huge move and take out Boston  Rob. <br/>We trust each other, but, we all want to win, and so, why  would we keep Rob in the game? <br/>Jeff: will Phillip's antics turn out to be part of a  genius plan to win it all? <br/>I made myself the villain so that everyone feels that  their best chance of winning against anybody is me. But, honestly, I think I can defeat Rob. <br/>Jeff: And finally, the winner of tonight's duel will  return from Redemption Island and re-enter the game. Who will it be? Matt, the christian who left his game in god's hands. Mike, the iraq war veteran and last Zapatera. Andrea, the only woman left at Redemption Island. Or Grant, the former nfl pro betrayed by Rob. It all comes to an end tonight. Find out who will win the million-dollar prize and the title of  sole survivor. <br/>I didn't think I was going to be voted out. I trusted the people in my alliance. You know, it turns out, you know, somebody wasn't being honest,  and possibly Rob betrayed me. Possibly Phillip did. And you know what? I'm a-okay, man. A-okay. Hi, guys. <br/>Oh! <br/>Grant! <br/>Hi, everybody. <br/>You can go-- go back through there and come...  Grant, you're the one I least wanted to come because it's  going to be like a stacked duel. Grant was pRobably the person I least wanted to show up at Redemption  Island, and sure enough he shows up. I mean, it's Grant, Matt, Mike, and I. So it's not going to be an easy duel. I'm going to be, like, the under-under-dog. But you know what? Throw it at me. <br/>No rain. <br/>That was a tough one, you guys. <br/>Yeah, it was hard. <br/>He cried, that really touched me. But we did what we had to do and it was great. <br/>Yeah, I'm all right. It sucks. <br/>I know it's tough. <br/>It's like, you know. <br/>I'm sure he's not happy right now, but what's done is  done. You know? It stings a little bit, but... That's the game. Tonight at tribal council, Grant got sent to Redemption Island. The irony is that it's completely my fault that he's gone. But at the same time, I miss him because Grant was a friend of  mine out here. As much as I like to think I'm a cold-hearted, calculating  player, it still does get me a little bit, you know. I got a heart in there somewhere. <br/>He knew he was a huge-- you know. <br/>Well, he is. <br/>He knew that. <br/>You know what I mean? I think Grant might be the only person on redemption that can  come back here and me actually want to vote them out next. If it's Matty, Mike, or Andrea, I don't know. Ashley's just no good. She's no good, she's got to go. That's in my gut. You know? She's got to go. Bye-bye, Ashley. <br/>I feel so great right now. I mean, I love this place. It's just-- it's become home to me. This is day 29 for me. I remember coming here that first night, and it raining,  thinking, how am I ever going to get through this? I was extremely bitter and upset and angry, but, you know, those  feelings came to pass because this is just a special place. <br/>All right... Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>This is your final! <br/>Yahoo! <br/>Whoo-hoo! <br/>I hope it's a pizza. <br/>"This is it, your final duel. When it is over only one of you will return to the game. The rest of you will join the jury."  Dig deep, we're digging. <br/>"This one will require you to dig deep."  Let's bring it back, Andrea. <br/>Dig deep. <br/>It's the final one! <br/>All right! <br/>All right! <br/>Turns out today is our last duel. Three will fall, three will go home, one will remain and  re-enter the game. I've had about 14 days out here on Redemption Island and a  little piece of me is going to miss Redemption Island. It's been a life-changing experience out here. You guys, you made it. Matty, your last...  Your last duel. <br/>It's bittersweet. Redemption island is wrapping up, but it's going to be great  knowing our fate one way or another. I mean, the Redemption Island purgatory is coming to-- coming to  an end. <br/>Dear lord, thank you so much for this morning. Thank you for Redemption Island and what it's done and meant to  all of us. Help us to dig as deeply as we can but know that your will is  perfect and have peace with whatever the outcome is, lord. Thank you so much for your son and we love you. Jesus name. Amen. <br/>Amen. <br/>Two blindsides, seven days in the actual game of  "Survivor," 11 duels, 29 days on Redemption Island. That's pretty unbelievable. God deserves all the glory and all the credit. My faith has grown, I've grown as a person. I mean, who knew what a treasure awaited on Redemption Island. <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the competitors for today's final  duel. Matt, Mike, Andrea, and Grant. Welcome to Redemption Island arena for your final duel. Phillip, Rob, Ashley, Natalie are all here to witness this duel  because, clearly, they have a vested interest in the outcome. Here's how it works-- you will place your foot on one end of a  balancing board. On the other end is a ceramic vase. When the vase falls, you're out of the challenge. You're out of the game. Last person left standing with their vase intact rejoins this  game and their shot at the money. Lose and you are out and will become the fifth, sixth, and  seventh member of the jury. This is it. One last shot. Take your spots. All right, here we go. Final duel. Place a foot on the end of the board and release. And just like that, we are on. Very simple challenge. Keep that vase balanced at the end of your board. When your vase drops off, you're out. You've now been balancing these vases for 20 minutes. Grant with a nice recovery. Close call for Matt. Mike with a nice recovery. Wake up, wake yourself up. Remember what we're doing here. Been up there 40 minutes now. Grant trying to stretch out that leg. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: Grant's vase drops. Grant is out of this game. Grant becomes the fifth member of the jury. We are now down to three. Matt, Mike, and Andrea. One hour you've been balancing a vase on the end of a board. Andrea stretching it out. And with that, Matt is out of this challenge and out of this  game. After 36 days in this game. <br/>Wow! <br/>Jeff: You survived 10 duels, but fell short when you  needed it most. Matt is the sixth member of the jury, has no shot at winning,  and we are down to two. Mike and Andrea in a showdown. A tough farm girl taking on the iraq war veteran. The winner gets back in this game. Mike nice recovery. Andrea with a nice recovery. Just make sure you're staying with your mind on what you're  doing. Mike drops his vase. <br/>Mike, good job, buddy. <br/>Jeff: Andrea stays alive and will re-enter this game and  continue her quest for the million-dollar prize and the title of sole  survivor. <br/>Hell of a job, Matty. <br/>Good job, Matt. <br/>Hell of a job. <br/>Jeff: Andrea, you had to be the biggest underdog coming  into this challenge. You did it. You're back in this game. Grant, 36 days. Came up just a little short. You become the fifth member of the jury. Take your buff off, put it in the urn. We'll see you at tribal council. <br/>Keep it going, you guys. <br/>Take care, man. <br/>Fell a little short on day 39, but you know what? There are gifts out here, and in any experience that if your  eyes are open, you can see them. I feel I have accomplished that. I'm proud of the work I've done on myself. I'm proud of the fact I was able to see those things. Mission accomplished. <br/>Jeff: Matt, you no longer have a shot at the money, but  you, too, will have a say in who wins this game. Matt, you become the sixth member of the jury. Take off your buff, put it in the urn. I'll see you at tribal council. <br/>You got it. [ applause ] see you all later. Burn, baby. See you all later. <br/>See you. <br/>In 36 days in the game and 29 days on Redemption Island,  god was with me every step of the way, and I think his will was ultimately  done, and-- and I praise his name for just letting me be a vessel for him. That's been my reward for all the struggle and all the strife  that I've been through. <br/>Jeff: Mike, you're the seventh member of our jury. Take off your buff, toss it in the urn. See you at tribal. <br/>Thanks, guys. See you. Today's outcome was not what I wanted. I wanted to get back into the game, try to be the sole survivor. But it wasn't meant to be, and that's all right. <br/>Jeff: Andrea, congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: You are in the final five. Four of you, come on down. Phillip, Rob, Natalie and Ashley. The five of are you back together again. Slightly different situation this time. So, Andrea, you're back in this game with the people who  blindsided you. Do you feel like you're a part of this foursome, now a  five-some? <br/>Not really. I think that I need to really prove myself and I need to do well  at challenges. I mean, obviously, I'm going to still try to work strategy and  see what's going on, but I mean, right now I feel like it's a very individual  game. <br/>Jeff: All right, grab your stuff. Head back to camp, and await word of your next challenge. Good luck. <br/>Thank you. <br/>The way I see it, between Phillip Andrea, Ashley, Natalie,  I have to vote for Ashley, because she played the game better. So as long as Ashley doesn't win immunity tomorrow, Andrea gets  to stay one more day. <br/>It was awkward coming back to camp. I mean, I've been gone. They voted me out. I came back. <br/>Great job knocking them dead. <br/>Thank you. <br/>You did a great job. <br/>Good job. <br/>They're not necessarily happy to see me. <br/>Now it's over. <br/>Good. <br/>No more redemption. <br/>I didn't feel completely welcomed, but then again, I was  voted off, so why would I? Right now, I need to, you know, try anything because otherwise  if I just sit back, I'm going to be the next to go. They basically called us like puppets. They're like, "Rob and his little girl puppets." I was  like, oh, okay. <br/>I told Natalie, Ashley, you know, some people were  thinking of voting for Phillip, which is a lie. I was making up this random stuff. I'm just trying to plant the seed. Now that I'm back in the game it's like, okay, now I get back to  the grindstone. <br/>Yeah! <br/>That's what we think. I'm definitely glad Andrea's back. I feel like, you know, Rob already burned her once. You know, I don't think she's going to trust him again, and  maybe she'll join with Natalie and I, and kind of try to take Phillip or Rob  out. <br/>Just focus on relaxing today, and then figuring it all out  tomorrow. <br/>Yeah. <br/>So I'm sure to you she's saying, "If Andrea wins  immunity, Rob must go."  Right. <br/>Yeah, we got to watch out, the three girls together. I mean, it's danger. Ashley drives me nuts. But her tactics are so amateur hour. Natalie's a good-hearted little soul, one that's loyal. And I don't like to see someone corrupt my soldiers. <br/>Yes. <br/>I can't wait to vote her ass out. I can't. 37 days. It's like patience is finally going to pay off and it's going to  be that much sweeter. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! Guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>We are. <br/>Jeff: First things first, Ashley. Give it up. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you'll race across a balance beam,  collecting a series of bags containing numbered tiles. You must place the tiles in order from one to 100. First person to get it right wins immunity. Guaranteed a one-in-four shot at winning this game. Losers, tribal council, where somebody will be voted out, will  not be sent to Redemption Island, instead will become the eighth member of  our jury. Big stakes. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. Here we go. For immunity. Guaranteed spot in the final four. Survivors ready? Go! Balance beam is your first obstacle and if you fall off at any  point along the way, you've got to go back. Rob has his first bag, quickly across. Everybody has their first bag and working on their first 10  numbers. Very simple. You have to put these numbers in order. The first section is 1 to 10. Rob, Andrea, Ashley, all heading out for their second bag. Rob back with his second bag of numbers. Andrea, Ashley back with their second bag. Phillip struggling to hang on that beam and he does. Natalie's across. This bag has 20 pieces. 10 more than the last. Phillip falls off. He's got to go back and start again. Ashley and Rob both finish their second bags at the same time. Looking for that third bag. Andrea's done with her second bag. Rob's back with his third bag. Ashley's back with her third bag. Andrea's back with her third bag. Natalie now looking for her third bag. Ashley working quickly. Natalie's back with her third bag. Phillip way behind at this point. Ashley with a bit of a lead. Rob trying to catch up. Ashley has her third bag of numbers completed, heading back for  that fourth and final bag. Can Andrea or Rob catch her? Ashley has her fourth bag. Phillip heading out for his third bag. He is out of this challenge. Natalie is falling out of this challenge. Andrea heading out for her fourth bag. Rob heading out for his fourth bag. Andrea back with her fourth bag. Rob has his fourth bag. It is Ashley, Andrea, and Rob all working on their fourth and  final bags. There are 40 numbers in this section. You have to put them in order. Rob has a strategy. He's stacking them. Ashley, meanwhile, continues one number at a time. She's in her 80s. This only goes to 100. Andrea's on her 70s. One row behind. Rob spent a lot of time stacking his numbers. And now he's quickly trying to lay them out and catch up. Ashley on her final row. Rob is going to have to hustle. Andrea's going to have to move. Ashley getting closer. 96... 97... 98. Ashley wins immunity and a guaranteed spot in the final four. Ashley, congratulations once again. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Immunity is yours. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Ashley, safe from the vote tonight. Guaranteed a one-in-four shot at winning this game. Overwhelming? <br/>Definitely is. Uh, yeah. I'm kind of at a loss for words. That was a big one. And just really excited, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: As for the rest of you, Phillip, Natalie, Boston Rob,  Andrea, after 37 days in this game, tonight one of the four of you will be  voted out and join the jury. Going to be an interesting afternoon figuring out what this  tribe that's been together so long is going to do. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I will see you at tribal. <br/>I am on the chopping block but it would make so much more  sense to vote out Rob now that he hasn't won immunity and keep me. I'm really relying on the girls to do something in the game. This really is actually an opportunity for them and hopefully  they'll be able to see it. <br/>I'm so excited I won. I kind of wish that this challenge was tomorrow's challenge  leading into the final tribal council. But I at least know that I'm here to compete again. <br/>Ashley won. So Andrea goes home. <br/>That's all right. I'll be here. <br/>Andrea's actually worked hard this game. She's been helpful around camp. She has a good relationship with people on the other side. Seems like a no-brainer to get rid of her. <br/>Just want you to know...  So it's her? <br/>It definitely is her. <br/>I just want us four, you know, to continue. <br/>Let's just vote Andrea's ass off. <br/>Okay, cool. <br/>Cool. There are no idols after tonight, and it's the last time I can  use my idol. I don't even need the idol. I decided, you know what, I'm going to go fishing. I don't have anything to worry about. I'm not going home tonight. <br/>I just want to make sure that we vote Andrea out, that it's  not me next time, it's Phillip. 100% Phillip. I feel like Rob is trying to keep Phillip around this whole time  so, like, when it comes down to it, he's going to, like, keep him till the  end. <br/>Yeah. I'm just frustrated because I feel like the same way, like,  there could be a possibility, you know. You never know he's telling me he's keeping you, but, you know,  you just never know. <br/>Can you promise me 100% that your vote will go towards Phillip  next time? <br/>Yes, I promise. <br/>Like, you won't vote for me. <br/>Right. <br/>It's always been me and you. <br/>I know. <br/>It doesn't need to, like, stop now. <br/>I know. <br/>Pinky swear. <br/>Pinky. <br/>Love you. <br/>Love you. <br/>Ashley and Natalie went down in the woods and talked  forever, it seemed like. So I thought, oh, my goodness. These girls are going to get together. And I went into my old special agent mode. When Boston Rob got back from fishing, I did what I told him I'd  do. I called him over and gave a report. They went back there when you went in the water and they talked  forever. They stood right there on the edge and spoke for, like, 10  minutes. I can't believe it was only about voting Andrea out. <br/>What is going on? This is so ridiculous. <br/>'cause they were out there for so long, I thought it was  very odd. <br/>It's really weird things happening. Rob and Phillip in front of me are openly talking. I can hear them. <br/>And I'm going to tell you that, they were talking for 10,  15 minutes. Let's go for a walk. <br/>There is a lot of madness going on. So there's a chance that something could get mixed up. <br/>This is, like, confusion going on right now. And I don't know why. <br/>While the boys are gone, I decided that I wanted to talk  to the girls and try to get in with them because I feel like I have more  leeway with them. <br/>No. <br/>If you think about it, I wouldn't want to be up against Rob  in the finals. Like, even though, you know, he's played, people are going to  vote for him. Like I actually wouldn't want to be up against him, either. <br/>Hold on. I'm so confused, bro. <br/>Okay. <br/>In the middle of this, what happened? <br/>Okay...  They went in the woods. <br/>Then they got up and went and got in bed. <br/>Like, I've been to Redemption Island, and I talked to  those people. They're not going to vote for you guys. They're going to vote for Rob. And that's coming straight from all those people from  redemption. <br/>I want you to know they did talk for a very long time in  the woods. <br/>Okay. <br/>I'm pRobably going to vote Rob. One vote. We have three votes. That could do anything. If we got rid of him, then it's us three and Phillip. We can decide if we want to take girls or him. <br/>Chances are, going up against Rob, you know, you're not  going to win. So it's tough because you have to make a decision, and people  are not going to be happy with you. It's not fun, but it is a game, and, you know, life must go on. <br/>Okay. <br/>Does that make sense? <br/>That makes sense. <br/>You follow that, okay. <br/>I got Phillip telling me the girls are in the woods  talking. Thanks, Phillip, welcome to day 37. I've played this game four times. Do these guys not realize that? Do they not realize that I can pretty much predict what they're  going to do and say before they actually do it. <br/>Let's do it. I can still dictate this vote. I don't even need the idol. As long as I have Natalie. I could take it home as a souvenir, too. What can I say? I like to gamble. God, I'm sick. I'm so sick. <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the members of our jury. David. Julie. Steve. Ralph. Grant. Matt. And Mike. Rob, played this game a lot. Where does this rank right now in terms of the paranoia? <br/>It's pretty high. People pulling me here and pulling me there. A lot of talking. A lot of different stories. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, were you a part of those discussions? <br/>Absolutely. Obviously, you've forgotten my title, the undercover specialist. <br/>Jeff: were you successful in your mission? <br/>If you want me to be perfectly clear about it, I could be. You know, I will be, actually. <br/>I asked Phillip to keep his eyes and ears open if he heard  anything about me getting voted off. <br/>Jeff: And that would mean the three women. That's all that's left. <br/>Right. <br/>Jeff: Ashley, surprise you that Rob's asking Phillip to  keep his ears open? <br/>It doesn't surprise me. Rob knows he's a strong competitor, and he's had a target on him  since day one, you know. He's Boston Rob. Who wouldn't want to take him out? <br/>Jeff: Andrea, got to be tempting. Three women. Two guys. That's an easy one. <br/>You know, that's kind of the line I was thinking. So I went up to the girls and I said, "This jury is a very  intelligent jury. They know who's pulling the strings here. They know who is actually playing a strategic game, and so far,  you guys haven't done anything strategic. This is an opportunity to actually take control of the  game." whether or not they actually can see that and actually gain some respect  from the jury is up to them. <br/>Jeff: So, Natalie, was that something you were receptive  to considering? <br/>Definitely, Rob is a huge threat. I have to consider all possibilities to get me the furthest. <br/>Jeff: Rob, you blindside Andrea. She went to redemption and took out Matt, Grant, and Mike. She's clearly a powerhouse in this game. <br/>She showed it again in the challenge today. I mean, she was right behind Ashley. She's a hard worker around camp. She's likable by everyone. It makes her a real threat to sit with at the end. <br/>Jeff: All right, it is time to vote. Tonight is the last night you can play a hidden immunity idol if  you have one. Ashley has the immunity necklace. You cannot vote for her. Everybody else is fair game. Phillip, you're up. <br/>Rob, you're a great player and my biggest competition so  that's why I'm voting for you tonight. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  tonight is the last night you can do so. <br/>You know what? My mother always told me better to be safe than sorry. Here you go. <br/>Jeff: This is the hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast against Rob will not count. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Rob. Does not count. Andrea. Andrea. That's two votes Andrea. 16th person voted out: Andrea. That's three. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Andrea, once again, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>All right. <br/>Jeff: well, congratulations. You have made it to the final four. Tomorrow you will compete in your final immunity challenge. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Try to get some sleep. <br/>The girls could have done something tonight. They could have made a move. And I'd actually have a little more respect for them. I think coming back from Redemption Island after winning a big  duel put a pretty big target on my back but I'm happy for how far I got. I had a great opportunity, great experience, met some wonderful  people and I wouldn't change it for the world. <br/>The final four! <br/>Final four! <br/>Congratulations. <br/>Guys. <br/>Congratulations. <br/>We got to have a group hug here, guys. I didn't know Rob had the immunity idol but I suspected he did  all along. So I think he played that brilliantly. <br/>Good job. <br/>Group hug, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh. I feel so special, man. <br/>We did it. <br/>A little weird. I can't believe it, I'm in the final four. We did what we said we were going to do-- stealth are us. <br/>Last two girls standing. <br/>Andrea tried to throw me and Natalie under the bus and say  that neither of us had made big moves in this game but it's funny because  she's not here anymore, and I am. So I get the last laugh when all is said and done. <br/>Nat, we're all in this together till the end, the three of  us? <br/>We're all in this together. <br/>And that's it. <br/>Promise. Promise, promise. <br/>100%. <br/>I'm going to win tomorrow, and then I'm going to take you  two, all right? Promise Phillip doesn't get in there. I, obviously, have the most to lose here. 10 years, four times on "Survivor," 116 days, one  challenge, for one million bucks. That's what it comes down to. It's pretty big stakes. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to your final immunity challenge? First things first, Ashley. Give it up. For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will race through a giant maze  collecting four bags of puzzle pieces. Once you have all four bags, you'll race to the top and use  those pieces to solve a word phrase. First person to get it right wins immunity, is guaranteed a spot  at the final tribal council where you will get a chance to plead your case,  why you deserve the title of sole survivor and the million dollars that goes  with it. Losers, tribal council. Somebody will be voted out of this game, and after 38 days, you  will fall one day short. Huge stakes. We'll draw for spots and we will get started. All right, here we go. For immunity and a guaranteed spot at the final tribal council,  survivors ready? Go! It is a complicated maze. There will be a lot of dead ends. There are four stations. There's a bag in each station. Ashley now following Rob. Natalie totally lost. Phillip making his way to a station. Rob has his first bag of puzzle pieces. Phillip has his first bag of puzzle pieces. Ashley has her first bag of puzzle pieces. Ashley and Rob neck and neck, both going for their second bags. Natalie has her first bag of puzzle pieces. Phillip heads into his second station. Rob has his second bag, Ashley has her second bag. Phillip has his second bag. Ashley drops her bag. She doesn't want to carry it. It is now Rob, Ashley, and Phillip. Each with two bags. Rob trying to lose Ashley. But Ashley is not letting Rob out of her sight. Rob has found the third station. Ashley right behind. Phillip hits another dead end. Rob has his third bag and he's out looking for that fourth and  final bag. Ashley has her third bag. She's right behind. Rob and Ashley both have one bag left. Phillip looking for his third bag. Natalie still looking for her second bag. Rob and Ashley looking for that fourth and final station. Ashley staying right with Rob. Rob has found the fourth and final station. Natalie being a good sport and still running around. Phillip heads into his third station. Ashley going for the fourth bag. Rob has his fourth and final bag. Now you've got to figure out how to get up here. Phillip has his third bag. Rob trying to find his way back. Ashley following him again. Phillip looking for that fourth and final bag. Natalie, one bag. Has only one bag. Rob heading back with all four bags. Rob is back with all four bags. Start working on that puzzle. Ashley right behind. Start working on it. It is a four-word phrase. Side by side, Ashley and Rob. Phillip and Natalie are falling out of this. Several different letter combinations. 38 days in this game. Comes down to this. Phillip still looking for that fourth and elusive final bag of  puzzle pieces. Natalie once again completely out of this challenge. <br/>Let's work together. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I don't have anything yet. You? <br/>Jeff: very unusual on day 38, and the final challenge for  a million dollars to work with someone else. Nothing? <br/>No. <br/>Jeff: You can work together all you want. Only one person will win immunity. Only one person will have that necklace tonight at tribal  council. <br/>Safe...  Jeff: Rob is saying he's got nothing going. Ashley still saying she has nothing going. The only question is, are they telling each other the truth? Rob changing it up. Trying new patterns now. New combinations of letters. Rob starting to put some words together. Is he right? "Only you are safe." he is. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Rob mariano wins final immunity! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Give me a hug. <br/>Good job. <br/>Congratulations. <br/>I found three of the bags. I couldn't find that elusive fourth one. <br/>Good job, Phillip. <br/>Good job, Ashley. You made it up there. <br/>Jeff: Boston Rob, come on over. [ applause ] when you needed it, you got it. <br/>Thank you. <br/>That was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. <br/>Good job. <br/>Jeff: Rob, safe tonight at the final tribal council. This means you are guaranteed a spot at that final tribal  council where you will get a chance to plead your case about why after four  times playing, you deserve to win. The big question this afternoon: who's going home? Who's going to the final? Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I'll see you at tribal tonight. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Jeff: Congrats. <br/>Thanks. <br/>It was amber that encouraged me to come back and try  again. She believes in me. It's 'cause of her. Like, whatever happens now, I'm okay. Even if I don't win. Which is ironic because the only reason I ever wanted to come  back to play again was to win. But... I feel like I did my best. But I'm not done yet. First of all, figure out which one of these other three idiots  I'm going to send home tonight, and then how I'm going to convince the other  people sitting on the jury to give me a million dollars after my wife's  already won one. <br/>No more challenges! Last tribal. Way to go, Rob. <br/>Last challenge ever. <br/>Great, man. You nailed it, brother. You did it, you did it. <br/>That was awesome. <br/>Basically at this point I just want to make Ashley and Phillip  both the feel like they're coming to the finals with me. It'll keep peace around camp for this afternoon. Then tonight, someone gets the final blindside. The pRoblem is, if I want to get rid of Ashley, I have to get Natalie  on board. And that's going to take some work. <br/>Yeah, we're good. Don't sweat nothing. <br/>All right. <br/>Hey. <br/>Yeah? <br/>No. <br/>Are you gonna tell him? <br/>No, he's going to freak out if I do. <br/>Is he gonna think it's me? <br/>Yeah, he's going to freak out. <br/>Yeah, I think that's a better decision. <br/>Yeah, I think so, too. <br/>I feel really, really confident. Rob has told me, like, don't sweat anything. Don't worry. You know, Phillip thinks it's me going home tonight. And I have such a good connection with Natalie that I know, even  if something did change and I was the one going home, I know Natalie would at  least tell me. So I feel confident going into tonight's tribal but always that  5% that you never know. <br/>That's sad. <br/>Hmm? <br/>You'd let me know if you heard anything? <br/>Ashley? <br/>I know, but I'm just saying. <br/>So it's day 38. We're going into the final tribal council. And we will be voting out Phillip. So I can't wait to spend the day tomorrow with Rob and Ashley. Phillip-free. <br/>I know. <br/>I have seven sisters. None of them as lazy as that girl right there. <br/>Yeah. She is in a league of her own. <br/>Rob hasn't, like, second guessed anything at all? <br/>Never. <br/>He has immunity. Why would he? <br/>The other pRoblem with Ashley is that while the Zapatera  people were here, she got awfully close to a lot of them. And pRobably created some bonds that would come to haunt me in  the final tribal council with her and Natalie. So, pretty much, I have to try to convince Natalie to vote off Ashley. She's not going to like it. It's Ashley. And, ultimately, she may not go along with the plan. <br/>But why? <br/>She has way too many friends on the jury. It just can't happen. I made a promise to you in this game that I'd get you to the end,  and I will. It has to happen this way. It's hard, I know. You got to be strong here, though, for the next couple of hours,  all right? <br/>I thought to myself that Rob could possibly come to me  last minute and ask me to vote for Ashley. <br/>It would be really, really, extremely tough for me at this  point, just because we have formed such a close bond and-- and I've promised  her that it's the three of us, and assured her. <br/>You've trusted me throughout this game, right? I promise I won't let you down. <br/>I didn't come out here to make friends, and I came out  here, and I did. <br/>Nat? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Rob has been watching my back since day one. But then again, at this point, I have to look out for myself. Honestly, like, I would rather lose this game than lose a friend  in Ashley. <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the members of our jury. David. Julie. Steve. Ralph. Grant. Matt. Mike. And Andrea. So, Rob, when you needed it most, you came through, winning  immunity today. Ashley, it was neck and neck. You were right there. This could be a million-dollar loss for you. <br/>It was a definite bummer, obviously. I knew I had to win that, that challenge. And, um, it's really disappointing, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: So, Rob, it's a pretty simple scenario right now--  you have the necklace. You're going to the final. That gives you a really big vote. <br/>Ultimately, you want to sit with the people that you think  that you can beat in the end. But you don't know how the jury is going to react to who you  vote out and for what reason. I've been to this point before, and it didn't work out. But, ultimately, I can only do what I can do, and then it's up  to these guys. <br/>Jeff: So, Natalie, you had to have taken a moment today to  try to plead your case with him. <br/>I mean, all along, we've been together on this, just  making decisions, and I hope that he would want me to stand next to him in  the end, and, I mean, I belong here. <br/>Jeff: what was your pitch, Phillip, to Rob? <br/>Rob knows that I was the specialist, and Rob is pRobably  very concerned that I could beat him because I won-- how many challenges? Oh, that's right. I didn't win any. <br/>Jeff: Ashley, what do you say to Rob? Why should he take you? <br/>You know, I've been loyal to Rob since day one. There's been many times that I could have thrown him under the  bus, and I haven't. You know, I'm just hoping that he'll carry me through to the  end, but I don't know. <br/>Jeff: Do you think you can win this game? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Do you think you have a better shot than Natalie or Phillip? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Okay, it is time to vote. You cannot vote for Rob. Everybody else is fair game. Phillip, you're up. <br/>I've never known anyone that could lay in bed day after  day each day. <br/>I can't believe it's taken 38 days to finally write your  name down. I won't miss you. You're a nut case. That's it. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Ashley. Phillip. Ashley. Two votes Ashley, one vote Phillip, one vote left. 17th person voted out, Ashley. You need to bring me your torch. Ashley, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Natalie, Boston Rob, Phillip, you've gone as far as you can go  in this game. Tomorrow night, nine people that you had a hand in voting out  will decide who they think is worthy of the title of sole survivor and the  million-dollar check. You have one more night under the stars of nicaragua. Try to get some sleep. I'll see you tomorrow night for your final tribal council. Congratulations. <br/>I honestly didn't know I was going home. I pRobably am an idiot for thinking that because I was the  biggest threat that Rob could have taken to the final three. As much as I would love to be sitting there in the final three,  I still have nothing to hang my head about and I'm proud of how I played the  game, and I wouldn't change anything. <br/>Day 39, I finally got to experience it for myself, that  feeling of, wow. You did it. Your great-great grandfather came to you in a vision and told  you when you had some doubt, "Remain committed, hold your faith, and you'll  get to the end." and I did. And, so, I thanked him for coming to sit a spell with me on this  journey of a lifetime in "Survivor." just had some private moment  where-- private moments of joy, being proud, went all the way with Boston Rob  and Natalie. I've learned a great deal about myself. I learned that it's okay to tell the world that I have a  relationship with somebody that's been dead since 1870. It's okay. And I learned that I can accept the good, the bad, and the  different. That's what's been great out here. So tonight, at the final tribal council, the plan is laid in  stone. I want to make it clear to the jury why they're sitting in the  jury and why I'm sitting in the final. I need to kind of put a little salt on that wound to make sure  folks don't forget that. I get the last laugh. <br/>Whoo! Yeah! <br/>We made it! <br/>We made it, baby. <br/>Look at all this food! <br/>I faced a lot of challenges out here, and this was the  hardest thing that I've ever had to do in my entire life. I'm 19, and I just feel like I stand for my generation. <br/>Congratulations. <br/>Congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>There's been times of fear, sadness and doubt, but I made  it through, and that's what this is all about. It's just overcoming your fears. To get this far, it gives me motivation to get back in the world  and do anything that I was ever afraid to do, and I definitely want to prove  myself to the jury tonight. But I do feel like I do have a shot. <br/>What did you say to save me when they were trying to get  rid of me? <br/>Man, it was a lot of work, let me tell you. <br/>Yeah, right. <br/>Every freakin' time. Wow, 39 days in nicaragua, 117 days total over the last 10  years. It's overwhelming. Winning this game has always eluded me. And, again, I find myself one step away from the top, and I'm  just hoping to get there. The jury can be funny sometimes. They try to make me cry, and you know what I did last time? I felt bad. And I said, "I'm sorry." and you know what? Looking back on it. That's the biggest regret I ever had. I should have stood up and said, "Hey, kiss my ass." I  haven't stopped playing the game. To some people it may look like I'm giving pointers to Natalie,  but I'm actually giving Natalie pointers on how I want her to handle tribal  council. And twice, you know, I made it all the way to the end. The first time the jury didn't feel I was worthy. I'm hoping that tonight, I'm not going to screw it up again. As far as I'm concerned, I've done my job. <br/>I want to say that I was never proud to wear plum-colored  underwear. However...  Are you getting rid of those things? <br/>Yes. <br/>I am so glad. Look at how saggy those things are. <br/>I knew that my manhood was not reflected in the briefs  that I wear. But, rather, the character that I bring to the game, and so,  with-- with happiness and joy, as I approach my destiny, I bid you adieu. <br/>Thank god! <br/>Thank god! <br/>Now go wash your hands. <br/>My great-great-great grandfather jessum... Would pRobably  say, "Like all good things, some things must come to an end." and  he'd be pleased to see those come to an end. <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the members of our jury. David. Julie. Steve. Ralph. Grant. Matt. Mike. Andrea. And Ashley. Well, Natalie, Rob, Phillip, congratulations. You did what 15 other people couldn't do in this game-- you made  it to the end. Tonight, the power in this game now shifts to the jury. That's how it works. Nine people that you voted out will decide who they think is  worthy of the title of sole survivor, and the million-dollar check that goes  along with it. Here's how it's going to work-- you will each get a chance to  make an opening statement. This is your chance to plead your case about why you deserve it. The jury will then get a chance to address you, try to elicit  information to help them make a very important decision. Then we will vote. All right, let's get started. Natalie, you're up. <br/>Okay. Um, I made it 39 days. I just wanted to come in here and play the best game that I  could, and I can honestly say that I did that. My strength in this game was my social skills, trying to figure  out who I wanted to align with. Luckily, Rob and I had an alliance from the very beginning. I stuck with his alliance, and that's how I made it this far,  and I've been loyal, and I, um, I deserve to be here. I would be the youngest female survivor winner if you decided to  vote for me. <br/>Jeff: Phillip. <br/>I deserve to be here because when I came in to the game, I  didn't know that the strategy I had put in place was gonna suddenly be turned  upside down. And that was when Boston Rob got off that helicopter. And I had to revamp my whole strategy while I was actually  playing the game. I changed my strategy and I went to Boston Rob and apologized to  him because I was going to vote him out at that first tribal council. I went to Boston Rob and said, "I'm so sorry." and I  have to say, he accepted my apology. And I take my hat off to him for that. And I can say that I wouldn't be sitting here right now if it  wasn't for Boston Rob. I thank him for that. Additionally, the fact that I implemented the whole concept of  the stealth, which allowed our tribe to stay together and actually devastate  the former zaps tribe. Boston Rob, his true name is the mastermind. He came up with the total concept of how we should go forward,  and I implemented it. And so I feel that's what got me here today, and maintaining my  loyalty to Boston Rob. <br/>Jeff: Boston Rob. <br/>All right, first of all, guys, I want to say thanks for  just giving me the opportunity to play with you, particularly Ometepe. I think if I was on Zapatera from the beginning, it may have  been a different story. The thing I wanted to talk to you about, I feel like I was  competitive in the challenges. I won four individual immunities. Strategically, I did put together many alliances, including the  six people that we stuck together. We all knew that once we got to six, it was going to get messy  and I had other suballiances within that. And finally, around camp life, I was a hard worker. And I did my part, but all of that doesn't Matter at all. What really Matters is what you guys think. Because at the end of this, this game, it switches, the power,  like Jeff said, from us to you. So it's what you guys consider to be successful quality in a  player. Another thing that I thought a lot about, you know, I've been  out here for 117 days, basically 10 years on and off. I've been trying to climb this mountain and get to the top of  it. And you know what... It's almost a third of my life. But does "Survivor" define me? It's been a huge part of my life and it's been a huge chapter in  my life and it's a game that I love, but it doesn't. At the end of the day, it's about my wife and my child. That's why I'm out here. I love this game, but ultimately, I want to win it so I can  bring something home so they can have a better future. So I hope that I played the game the best in your eyes, and I  hope you vote for me tonight. Thank you. <br/>Jeff: All right, jury, in a moment, your first chance to  address Natalie, Boston Rob, and Phillip. I'll give you a moment to think about what you want to say. <br/>Jeff: All right, jury, finally after 39 long days, you  will each get a chance to address Natalie, Boston Rob, and Phillip. The goal is simple-- you're looking for information to help you  make a million-dollar decision. Andrea, get us started. You're up. <br/>All right. First of all, I want to start with Phillip. You are weird. My question to you, we have seen a plethora of different Phillips,  you know-- Phillipe, chef, the special agent-- and it makes me wonder, like,  who is the real Phillip sheppard? Go. <br/>First of all, the reason you didn't know who I was is  because I was on the outside of the original Ometepe tribe. So, therefore, you're right. You don't know who I am. <br/>Can you not answer it? <br/>I'm Phillip sheppard. I gave you my name. You had 39 days to understand who I am. If you don't, then don't vote for me. <br/>Thank you. All right, Natalie, I notice that you had a really interesting  relationship with Rob, almost borderline creepy at times to some of us. You were so loyal to him that you betrayed what I thought was  your best friend this entire time. <br/>Ashley and I made a great friendship out here. Bit this isn't about friendships. And this is a game. <br/>Okay, so then I guess I'm just wondering what is it about Rob  and this, like, allure of riding coattails that you chose over Ashley? <br/>I just think if you were asked by Rob, somebody that has  been in this game, has experience-- I never camped a day in my life. I stuck to Rob and we agreed that we would take each other to  the end. <br/>Okay, that's fine. So, I guess that's all I have. Thank you for your answers. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Andrea. <br/>Sorry if I ever seemed creepy. <br/>Jeff: Ashley, you're up. <br/>Congratulations, you guys. Phillip, I don't have any questions for you because, frankly,  I'm sick of hearing your voice, so I'm going to speak and you're not going to  comment. <br/>I will, if I feel the need. <br/>No, you're not. <br/>Yes, I will, I'm doing it now. <br/>That's really pathetic. You look really pathetic. I want to say my peace so you're just gonna sit there. <br/>Say your peace but don't tell me what I'm going to do. <br/>First of all, I want to start by thanking you, actually,  because I came into this game really, really an impatient person. Having survived a tortuous 38 days with you, I can get through  anything. So thank you. <br/>You sound like a little whiny child. <br/>Moving on. Natalie, we actually agreed to share everything, and we did, as  far as I was concerned. And when I asked you to make just a gesture as a friend to let  me know if I was going home, you actually told me I was coming back that  night. <br/>It was a back-and-forth decision between Rob and I whether  to keep Phillip or you. Honestly, 10 minutes before tribal council, we decided that it  was going to be you. You are a bigger threat, and if were sitting here-- you know,  you want the people sitting here...  Who don't deserve to be there, I get it. Right. And that's kind of sad. Rob, obviously, you deceived a lot of people, and I just feel  kind of sad because I-I, too, put you up on a pedestal. I get that it's a game, but I don't know who you are, and,  honestly, after this, I don't even know if I really want to know. That's all I have to say. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Ashley. Grant. <br/>Hi, guys. Natalie, I also had an alliance with Rob that I thought was  pretty strong. And I just want to know from your opinion, and I know it's already  been harped on a little bit, but just, what was the dynamic of that alliance  to you? And, Rob, the question goes to you as well and vice versa. So, Natalie, go ahead. <br/>Rob came to me in the very beginning, and we both-- we  both felt like we could trust each other. And I know both of us had the same, maybe, conversation with Rob. I don't know what went on with you two. I just knew that you were a huge threat, and I think you know  that you-you were in this game. <br/>First of all, Natalie came up to me and said, "Tell  me what to do." so I said, "Natalie, if you do exactly what I tell  you to do, I'll take you all the way to the end." the relationship that  we had, I also trusted and valued all the way up until I felt like you were  going to kick my ass. Because, honestly, I didn't want to go against you sitting here. <br/>Well, I still think it would have been fun to duke it out  at the end with you like I said from the very beginning. And... Good luck. <br/>Jeff: Ralph, you're up. <br/>Well, appreciate you all making it, ladies and gentlemen. Natalie, it seemed like you can't really do nothing without  keeping your eye on Rob, like a kid. <br/>I-- you know, I didn't realize that you all thought I was  creepy towards Rob. I found a really-- Rob and I had a really good relationship out  here, so...  So you're trying to keep an eye on him. You're afraid to make a decision without him. You never did talk to me in the game, period. We never did talk, never did. <br/>There was a reason for that, and that was because...  He said not to. <br/>I wanted my tribe to trust me, and we all saw what  happened with Matt, so I wanted my tribe to realize that I was going to be  loyal to them. And I didn't want any misconception. <br/>Okay, you done great. Phillip, you've let me down. I was wanting a whole chicken on that head, with feathers. Tell me why ain't you got any more feathers than that. <br/>Well, I only put the feathers in as I discovered them so  these are the only feathers I discovered. Sorry to disappoint. <br/>Do you really like me, Phillip? <br/>Actually, Ralph, out of all of the people that were on  your tribe, I love your work ethic. I think you were funny. You're a very decent man. And I think that if you were in our tribe, you and I would have  got along pretty well. Thank you for playing the game. <br/>Thank you, Phillip. <br/>You're welcome, Ralph. <br/>Jeff: Matt, you're up. <br/>Excuse me, fellas. All right. Hi, guys. My one question here is for Rob. Clearly, you're very duplicitous, manipulating, deceiving, and  you were a liar. Where is the line drawn after 117 days, 10 years, and four  seasons of "Survivor?" because I just don't know how you can keep  yourself together after this much time out here. <br/>The line's drawn as soon as I'm back in my real life. But inside of the game of "Survivor," I feel like it's  necessary to play like this. I had alliances with every member of the Ometepe. And at one point or another, everybody thought that they were  going to the end with me. Until they were voted out. Which is pretty harsh, but I find it to be very effective in  playing. <br/>Well, all the people that you betrayed are having a very  hard time understanding who you really are. Great job to all three of you. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Matt. Julie. <br/>You three should be sitting there very, very humble, very  humble because in my opinion, none of you played a respectable game. Natalie, when you won the first immunity challenge, I told you  how proud your parents were going to be of you, their little girl. Now that the game is over, a question for you to ask yourself--  because I don't want to hear the answers from any of you guys-- is do you  think your parents would be proud of the way that you played the game? Because if you were my daughter, the answer would be no. I would be very sad to see my daughter be a servant to anybody  the way you were a servant to Rob. Phillip, you're right-- Rob did bring you here to the end, and  it's not because of your loyalty. It's because everybody here on the tribe, none of us like or  respect you at all. That's why you're here. My message to you is you are the father of a 16-year-old  son...  And very proud of it. <br/>And I hope that you ask yourself would your son be proud  of the way that you played the game? <br/>My son would be very proud of the way I played the game. As you often said, "Phillip, you're the hardest working man  on your tribe." it's only now that you're sitting on the jury that you  see something else. <br/>I'm not going to take your work ethic away from you. <br/>The hell with you. The hell with you. <br/>Okay, the hell with me. Rob, look where you're sitting. You're sitting next to the little girl that rode your coattails  and you're sitting next to the guy that none of us like or respect. <br/>By the way, I didn't come out here to get your respect. I came out here to kick a little ass, and I think I did that. <br/>In the challenges? <br/>I didn't do it in the challenges. I did it in the social game. That's why none of you knew just how close I was to Boston Rob. [ oohing ]  Rob, my message to you is as a father, teach your  daughters to grow up to be strong women and not be treated the way that you  treated Natalie. Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Mike, you're up. <br/>Okay, Phillip, Rob, Natalie, through my  "Survivor" experience I was able to get closer to god, build my  faith, develop some incredible friendships, meet some incredible people and  some incredible bonds, and find some inner peace for myself, something that  you can't purchase with money. My-my question to each one of you is, aside from learning how to  deceive and trick and win a million dollars, did you learn anything about  yourselves out here that you're going to carry with you? Natalie, go ahead and fire away. <br/>I learned a lot. Being that I'm 19 years old, fresh out of high school, never  have camped, really, I didn't think that I would make it 39 days sleeping on  bamboo, eating two spoonfuls of rice. But I'm strong and I'm more capable than I ever thought I could  be. This experience has provided me with confidence with my life. And I've really come to appreciate my family and what they've  made me to be today. <br/>Very good, thank you. Rob? <br/>I think the biggest thing I've learned through this, being  my fourth time, is that I need to stop playing games. It's time to put it to rest. This is the last day I will ever play. At this point, I need to go home and take care of my wife and my  children. That's what I'm going to do. <br/>Okay, okay. Phillip? <br/>For me, I feel so blessed that I had the opportunity to do  this because I ain't never done anything like this in my life. You know what I learned? That I could stand on my own. I could be by myself. An outcast, which I already knew, but in this environment. I could bring what I've done my whole entire life as a boy who  left home at 16 years old and worked through the service, became a federal  agent, and support my child by myself. I am a beacon in the sheppard family. <br/>Very good. Okay. Well, thanks, guys. I appreciate it. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Mike. Steve, you're up. <br/>Natalie and Rob, I congratulate you guys for withstanding  the elements here for the last 39 days. And, Natalie, I just really want to commend you for being 19  years old. However you had to play the game, you're sitting over there and  I'm over here, so I congratulate you for that. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Rob, I take my hat off to you, too. 117 days-- I buckled at 31. So, I congratulate a fellow warrior that took it to another  level. Phillip, I just... I just gotta say that... I'm sorry for you. For who you are, what you've grown into. I think you're a pretty shameful, sorry man. Good luck to you two, whatever you-- going on. Thanks. <br/>Jeff: David, close it out. <br/>And now for something completely different. I'm not going to ask you guys any questions. I'm not even going to talk to you. I'm going to talk to them. There's really only one logical decision here. Well, one person doesn't deserve it, so we can cut him off. The other one thanked somebody for doing it all. Who did she thank? The guy sitting in the middle. He did everything. And most importantly, he managed to blindside Matt. And in the process of doing that, he sent a message to his tribe  that if any of you show any signs of not being loyal, you're going to go  home. He controlled all of you. He controlled your minds. He controlled what you did. He controlled your thoughts. You all bought it and one by one by one, all of you were  blindsided. A little ruthless, but brilliant. When we started this game, two people came in. One of them claimed to be the best to ever play the game. He walked out on day eight. There's a guy sitting over there that just played the best  strategic game this game has ever seen, and it's pretty damn easy to tell you  who deserves to get your vote tonight. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, David. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>Jeff: All right, so, pretty healthy back-and-forth. Great questions. Jury, you've had a lot of information. I'm going to give you a minute to think about everything you've  heard. Then we will come back and you will make a million-dollar  decision. <br/>Jeff: All right, jury, you've had your chance to address Natalie,  Rob, and Phillip. You've heard their responses. It's now time to vote. Tonight, you are voting for a winner. For the person you think most deserving of the title of sole  survivor and the million dollars that goes along with it. For the last time, it is time to vote. Mike, you're up. <br/>No big surprise here. You did a great job. I would much rather have played this game with you than against  you, but, hey, that's the way it works. <br/>Hey, Phillip, take that money and spend it wisely. I feel sorry for you. And I love you, man. Have a great one. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Jeff: I'll go get the votes. Natalie, Rob, Phillip, jury, thank you for a great season of  "Survivor." one of you three has just won a million dollars. I'll see you back in new york city for the reading of the votes. <br/>Jeff: All right! Nice, excited crowd. Have a seat. [ cheers and applause ] that's a nice welcome. It is good to be live in new york city. All right. Well, I gotta say, congratulations, Natalie, Rob, Phillip. This is a-- this game is so much tougher, I think, than anybody  can ever know. Even I don't appreciate it and I've been out there doing this  for 22 seasons. So I always tip my hat to you guys. You survived a rough tribal council, final tribal. These guys were not easy on you. But in a minute, at least for one of you, it's not going to  really Matter because somebody is about to become a millionaire. Deep breath. You nervous, Natalie? <br/>Yeah, a little bit. It is what it is. <br/>Jeff: Do you think you have a shot at winning this game? <br/>I tried my best. I did what I could do. And I'm just-- I've taken so much out of this game and so much  knowledge and so much-- just, like...  All right, yes or no? <br/>Yes. [ laughter ] I do. <br/>Jeff: Rob, can you win this game? <br/>I hope so. You know, I think Natalie said it best. All you can do is your best. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, do you, after everything you've been  through have a shot at having votes in here enough to win you a million  bucks? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: All right, let's get to the votes. These are votes for a winner. Tonight you want to see your name on the parchment. For a million bucks, I'll read the votes. [ applause ] first vote, Rob. [ applause ] Phillip. [ applause ] one vote Rob, one vote Phillip. Rob. [ applause ] two votes Rob, one vote Phillip. Rob. That's three votes Rob, one vote Phillip. Rob. [ applause ] that's four votes Rob, one vote Phillip. No votes Natalie. The winner of "Survivor: Redemption Island," Rob. [ cheers and applause] Yay, he did it. <br/>Yay, he did it. <br/>Jeff: After playing a record four times, Boston Rob  finally accomplished his goal of winning survivor, and he did it with a style  that would make any mob boss proud. Redemption island added a new twist. It challenged Matt's faith and sent the game's greatest villain,  Russell, home in tears, and Phillip sheppard emerged as one of the most  polarizing people to ever play. The big question-- is he really a former federal agent? We will find out. We are live in new york city! Survivor: Redemption Island reunion showis next. [applause and cheering] [band plays]
