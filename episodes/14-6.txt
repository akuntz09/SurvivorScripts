<br/>Probst: Previously on... Survivor:  I slept really well last night. <br/>Probst: From day one, a twist in the game resulted in the Moto Tribe living a  privileged lifestyle. <br/>It's just going too great. <br/>Yeah, it's, like, too good to be true, man. <br/>It's not even survival, it's "thrival."  Probst: While Ravu had next to nothing. <br/>Water! <br/>Just lick some leaves, man. <br/>I've never experienced dehydration like this. Half of us can't even stand up. It's crazy. [laughs]: We're starving here, bro. <br/>Probst: ...the disparity between the two tribes helped Moto go undefeated in  the challenges... Dre scores for Moto! ...leading to animosity. <br/>Why don't me and you go up there right now. <br/>We could. <br/>Let's do that, then. <br/>Probst: Especially between Rocky and James. [indistinct shouts] Moto wins reward! <br/>This ain't the instant dissolve coffee. <br/>Probst: Despite Moto's comfort... a game of politics was consuming the tribe. <br/>So if you guys know how to make it, tell him how to make it. <br/>When we get into the merge, me and Cassandra are gonna leave and go with the  other tribe. <br/>Probst: At Ravu...  You are driving me absolutely insane. <br/>Probst: ...they were having problems of their own. You get all, like, sentimental and sensitive. You're a man: act like one. Sitting around dealing with somebody, you really can't tell him how you feel  because you're worried about his vote. Right now I could care less about his vote. <br/>Truthfully, I go out, I'm just lip gloss, good to go. <br/>Probst: And no one could escape Rocky's short fuse. <br/>Rita is basically wanting me take my T-shirt and hang myself from a palm tree. <br/>Probst: And we are tied, six-six. At the last immunity challenge, it was as close as ever. Yau-Man, trying to remember. But a couple of fatal mistakes... Yau-Man makes his selection, and it is  wrong. Rocky could win it for Ravu right here. ...sealed Ravu's fate. No match. Moto wins immunity! With Ravu heading back to Tribal Council...  Anthony okay with you, then? <br/>It's fine. <br/>Anthony okay with you? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>All right? <br/>Probst: It came down to Anthony or Rita. <br/>Well, Rita's running her mouth all day, guy. Rita's got to go. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council... Fifth person voted out of Survivor: Fiji... ...Anthony  escaped the vote, and Rita was sent home. Rita, the tribe has spoken. 13 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? âª âª [flies buzzing]  These freakin' flies, man, where did that come from? where did that come from? Didn't used to be like this. Didn't used to be like this. <br/>Today's day 15. I'm very surprised I'm still in the tribe. Uh, I guess I dodged a big bullet this last round when I screwed up on the,  uh, immunity challenge, and I'm glad my head was not on the chopping block. People like me don't have that much to offer in terms of the strength and  power component, and so I think if it comes down to who is the most  dispensable, then, you know, I'm definitely then, you know, I'm definitely  one of the candidates. one of the candidates. <br/>Take it out? <br/>Okay. Let's see what we have. Ooh, it's heavy. <br/>Oh. <br/>It's not socks. "Today no brawn required. Some brain-teasing at the least. When it's over, one gets exiled, while others get to feast."  Nice, bro. <br/>So we just got tree mail, and we're excited about tree mail because today  tree mail is mail because today tree mail is all about brainteasers and food. all about brainteasers and food. all about brainteasers and food. <br/>Probst: Come on in. <br/>Probst: Come on in. Moto getting your first look at the new Ravu Tribe. Rita voted out at the last Tribal Council. How's everybody doing? <br/>Pretty good. <br/>Good. <br/>Probst: Need one person from each tribe. Pick a spot right over here. Edgardo for Moto. Edgardo for Moto. Earl for Ravu. Earl for Ravu. Everybody, drop your butts. We are choosing new tribes. We are choosing new tribes. <br/>[whispers]: What?! <br/>[whispers]: What?! <br/>[whispers]: What?! [theme song playing] [theme song playing]  Probst: The tribes of Moto and Ravu as you knew them are no more. Let's get to it. Earl and Edgardo volunteered to step forward. You two will start the new tribe selection. The rest of you will alternate. When selecting a member, you must choose somebody from the other tribe. And because there's an odd number of people, one person will not be selected  on either tribe. Moto, because you have the numbers advantage, you've earned the right to  select first. You are choosing somebody from the Ravu tribe. <br/>Mookie. <br/>Probst: Rivals become tribe mates now. Earl, somebody from Moto. <br/>Boo. <br/>Probst: Boo joins Earl. Mookie. <br/>Alex. <br/>Probst: Alex joins Mookie and Edgardo. Boo. <br/>Michelle. <br/>Probst: Michelle joins Boo and Earl. Alex. <br/>Rocky. <br/>Probst: Rocky joins Alex, Mookie and Edgardo. <br/>Wow. They're looking strong. <br/>Probst: Michelle. <br/>I'll take Cassandra. <br/>Probst: Michelle chooses Cassandra to join herself, Boo, and Earl. Rocky, your choice. <br/>Come on, Dreamz. See if you can work this out, baby. <br/>Probst: Maybe the biggest rivalry thus far in Survivor: Fijijust paired up. Dreamz joins Alex, Mookie, Edgardo and his new friend, Rocky. Cassandra. <br/>Yau-Man. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man joins Cassandra, Earl, Michelle, and Boo. Dreamz, you have only one choice. You have to choose somebody from the old Ravu. That person is Anthony. Anthony joins a tribe consisting only of men at this point. Yau-Man, last tribe member to be selected on these two tribes. Who you gonna take? <br/>Stacy. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man takes Stacy. Lisi, never good to be odd person out. You are, however, still in the game. <br/>Aw, geez! [laughing]  Probst: Were you worried? <br/>No. I thought this would be, like, I'm out. Now would be a good time to exit. <br/>Probst: Well, so I guess you just told these guys that you're fine going home. <br/>All I'm saying is that I wouldn't mind, you know... saying, "Okay,  great, guys, do your business."  Probst: Well, for the time being, you're still in this game. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Probst: You'll be going to Exile Island. <br/>Oh, geez! Thanks. That's just great. That's just great. Thanks. <br/>Probst: But maybe a little time on Exile... to straighten out your head,  you'll come back wanting to play. The good news, Lisi, whether you think so or not, you won't be going to  Tribal Council, which means you can't be voted out. You will return after the next Tribal Council and join whichever tribe did go  to Tribal and had to vote somebody out. Also, there is another clue to the whereabouts of a hidden Immunity Idol. Perhaps you'll find it, won't want it, we'll give it to somebody who does. <br/>[laughs]  Probst: Boat's waiting for you. <br/>Great. Thanks. Uh, bye, guys. <br/>Probst: Okay, one very big decision left to make. Which group is going to live on the luxurious Moto Beach...  We are. <br/>We'll take that. <br/>Probst: ...and which group of people's going back to Ravu. Edgardo, take a step forward. Earl, take a step forward. Here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna take both these buffs. You two are gonna rock-paper-scissor to see who gets the right to reach in  and select. <br/>All right, Earl. <br/>All right. <br/>One, two, three. <br/>One, two, three. <br/>Probst: Paper covers rock. Edgardo earns the right to choose. <br/>50-50. Do it. <br/>Probst: If Edgardo pulls out a green buff, that means you guys are all going  back to the lap of luxury. If Edgardo pulls out the orange buff, you're gonna be tested at Ravu Camp. You ready? <br/>I'll go with my right hand. <br/>Go ahead and grab that  Go ahead and grab that orange. orange. <br/>Probst: Show it. <br/>Probst: Show it. [whooping] [whooping] Here's the rest of your buffs. <br/>Don't sweat it, Eddie. Don't sweat it. We'll make it up. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man, Michelle, Earl, life's gonna change. You're going to Moto Beach. Here are the rest of your buffs. Waiting for both of you back at your new homes is a little housewarming gift. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: For those of you who have been to Exile Island, those clues are still  in play just like they always were. Grab your stuff, guys. Head on back to your new home. Head on back to your new home. âª âª  Clue number six. "The highest point, the jutting point, the edge of the lip, below. Dig, dig, dig and save yourself from the fatal blow." Yeah. Whatever. After the team split, yeah, I pretty much had a fit. I had a cushy alliance. I felt like my comfort zone was yanked. I thought I was going home. I'm, like, whoo-hoo! And, all of a sudden, Jeff is, like, "You're going to Exile  Island." And I got pissed. I wish I would have just stopped for a minute and let things soak in, but I'm  more of an abrasive character. Dude, I can't change who I am. You either take me or you put me You either take me or you put me on Exile  Island. on Exile Island. <br/>Moto, baby, welcome home! [whooping, indistinct talking]  What do we got, Earl? <br/>Look at Earl. [indistinct talking, whooping]  No way, don't get in the bed dirty, Earl! <br/>Don't get in the bed dirty. <br/>Ah... Life at Team Moto is better than ridiculous, it's ridonkulous. Garcon! My breakfast. Nothing, everything. Nothing, everything. I-I like ev... I think I'll go with everything. <br/>Hey, guys, y'all sit down. Let's go. Get y'all a plate. <br/>Y'all eat, y'all serve your own selves first. <br/>Eat slow so you don't, you know, you don't get sick. <br/>This is real food. Man! <br/>Oh, this is good cheese. <br/>Anything is good at this point. <br/>I'm trying to just, like, keep myself contained. <br/>After I survey the land and look at the situation a little more, um, I will  be looking for the Immunity Idol. Yau and I have an upper hand, 'cause we're the only ones that know about  Exile Island and the clues and what's going on. So I am not worried, not at all, about someone else trying to find the idol,  'cause they have no idea that it's even on this island. [chattering and whooping]  I'm gonna have a mimosa. <br/>Oh, a mimosa? Don't you dare have a hangover. <br/>Guys, cheers. <br/>Yummy. <br/>To the new Moto. <br/>OTHERS: To the new Moto. <br/>New Moto. <br/>New Moto. <br/>Moto-licious, baby. <br/>Moto-licious, baby. <br/>Oh, my God, let's eat! Let's eat! <br/>Big morale went up. Don't let this morale go down. <br/>Well, I'll tell you, it's rough out here. <br/>I want to say something, though. There was two choices-- either had that tribe over there...  Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. <br/>No, no, no, but I'm saying, like, we're gonna be way stronger in challenges,  and if tomorrow we have a challenge, we kick ass, man. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We're gonna kick some ass. It's men now. [several talking]  Men! Yeah! <br/>Showing up here, you know, it's really not that bad. <br/>Whoa! <br/>Yeah, I had a strong alliance-- it was Boo, Stacy, Lisi and myself-- um, but  I always felt there was kind of a power struggle. The girls were difficult to predict. I wasn't sure where Boo stood half the time. So being in a tribe where I feel like, you know, we're all gung-ho, we're all  warriors, we're ready to take these guys on, I'm very happy with it. [whooping] And this may sound weird, but, like, I'm glad that there are no  women here, man. The women are just politics and it's just, like...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. <br/>That's why... that's why every person that's been voted off has been a woman,  you know what I mean? <br/>It's just, like, I was getting so sick of dealing with them. <br/>I-I only need to ask one question. How was Sylvia in camp, man? [laughter]  Shoot myself in the face...  That's why she was out. <br/>Just excited to, you know, be eating, hanging out with some of the boys. No offense, I love women, I love 'em, I love to touch 'em and make out and  have conversations with 'em, get along well. But, uh, you know, in this type of environment, this type of game, you don't  need any, like, stupid, like, girl stories or distractions or any stupid  things like that. <br/>There's a little quote that gets me through, like, a lot of, like, rough  times. I don't know if you ever seen The Count of Monte Cristo,the movie. <br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah. <br/>It starts out, there's a line in it that goes, um... "Life is a storm,  my young friends. One day you're battered in the sunlight, and you're shattered on the rocks  the next. But it's what you do when that storm comes that makes you a man. So shout, do your worst, for I shall do mine, and the fates will know you as  a man."  Yeah. <br/>I remember that scene. That scene was awesome, too. We'll say that every time we go We'll say that every time we go to a challenge. to a challenge. [laughter]  Yeah, we have different strategies, my friend, but I assure you, the result  is the same. <br/>Yes. [thunder rumbles]  What's going on? Yeah, what's the situation out here? [indistinct conversation]  We have tons of coconuts, tons of crabs. So we go crabbing and snails. <br/>We should light a fire before that, or...? <br/>Yeah, light a fire, get one going, and then go fishing and catch some hermit  crabs. <br/>You want to have Anthony just get the fire going and we'll go fishing or...? <br/>Yeah. If you don't mind, Anthony? <br/>Is that cool? <br/>All right, let's do it. <br/>Hey, let's all grab some wood on the way back, though. <br/>All right. <br/>Cool. âª [indistinct chatter]  So, there's this time in everybody's life, in high school, that first gym  class, when everybody has to go take that first shower afterwards, when  nobody really wants to take their shirt off, except for the guys who know  that they're cut. I'm a nerd; I know this. I'm a nerd, I'm a geek, I'm a dweeb, or whatever the hell you want to call it. I have been for forever. This is the burly man team, and right now I'm obviously the weakest person in  the tribe, and, um, I got my work cut out for me. I am so screwed right now. Uh... Uh... wow. wow. [bat screeches] [chittering]  We're gonna have to go with these. <br/>Yeah. <br/>So we'll use that line. I think that's the thinnest line. I'm gonna use these two. <br/>Yeah, there's two more...  This switch threw a couple of roadblocks into my million, but this game is  full of roadblocks. I was counting my million. [laughs] I had it tight, my plan was tight, but it's changed. It might come full circle if things work out like I want. We'll see. <br/>Hopefully, we can have some fish, potatoes and rice for breakfast. Is that a nice, big, energetic breakfast with some coffee? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>There's three old Moto and, uh, three old Ravu on the new Team Moto that I  started. And I know that makes Boo a little nervous. So I know the game is really beginning. They're gonna try to get a swing vote... from somebody. But everything is gonna have to go through me. Everything. My plan was always to have your friends close and your enemies friends close  and your enemies closer. closer. <br/>Earl. <br/>Delivery service. <br/>[laughs]: It's not much. I got you guys a little shot each. <br/>Thank you, ma'am. <br/>You're welcome. [sighs]: Ah. <br/>Wow, coffee! <br/>This place is definitely positive for me than the last camp. I felt, as far as alliances, I was on the out. I like Earl a lot. I like, um, Yau-Man a lot. You know, I'm a free agent right now. I'm really just gonna try to see how the cards fold over the next couple of  days. <br/>Cassandra, do you think Boo feels nervous? <br/>Oh, very. He had a lot of allies on the other team. <br/>It's a different chemistry and dynamic now, so...  Mm-hmm. <br/>You could be a swing vote. <br/>I know. <br/>You could change everything. <br/>Oh, I know. <br/>And Boo could be gone. <br/>I know. <br/>Just like that. <br/>I know. <br/>Just like that. <br/>Mm-hmm. [laughs]  A word or two here and there in the right situation, you paint the picture  the right way, she could be right on my side. Appreciate you bringing the coffee. <br/>Sure, sure. You guys keep fishing. <br/>Yeah, we're trying to do something. <br/>[laughs]  It'd be nice to have a little meat. I have Yau-Man, I have Michelle. They're all about the team. All you need is that one vote, and then who has all the power then? then? That would be me. That would be me. <br/>I got my work cut out for me. 'Cause right now I guess I've replaced Yau-Man as the fire tender and the  water tender. And right now I feel pretty alone. I got nobody to trust. I have absolutely no one to trust over here. And... I got to see if I can change that. But unfortunately, I'm left back here at the homestead to tend the fires, while...  the big men go off and Cookie's still here go off and Cookie's still here at  the campfire. at the campfire. <br/>Look at this, man. Look at all these... Hey, Rocky, come here. <br/>What's that? <br/>Look at all these crabs. <br/>I'll hold the stick up here and I'll shove 'em off. <br/>That's your shell, buddy. <br/>Ooh! <br/>He's right there. <br/>Oh, oh, oh! <br/>He's right here. He's right here. Step on him. <br/>You like that, don't you, crab? <br/>Hey, hey, hey. <br/>I mean, what I felt these guys needed-- um, Anthony, Rocky and Mookie-- they  just needed a kick-start. Now, food notwithstanding, these are men that I think are true competitors,  and if I was losing every single time, I mean, I mean, that would definitely  do something to my psyche. <br/>Wait, so how is Anthony holding up? Is he doing all right? <br/>He's doing all right. <br/>I'm not gonna say... He looked a little flustered at some of those challenges. <br/>Uh, he's a little effeminate. You know? <br/>There's nothing wrong with that. <br/>No, no, I'm not saying that anything's wrong with it, it's just, you know...  sometimes it's hard for him to carry his own weight. <br/>Who-who... If y'all had three people going to merge, who would it have been? <br/>I mean... all strategy changes, you know what I mean? <br/>Yeah. It's crazy now. Everything is crazy now. <br/>There's a lot of crab... Coming into this, it's three-three. Majority rules always in Survivor. So I knew that I needed to bring in one person from the other tribe. Rocky, I don't know very well, but I know he doesn't get along with Dreamz,  and I know he's sort of a volatile personality. Anthony does not strike me as a particularly strong player in this game. And Mookie and I had clicked before, and I knew it would be in Mookie's best  interest to in Mookie's best interest to join up with us. join up with us. <br/>But, oh, a huge fish. Right there, right there, Mook. Right there, right there, Mook. Mook, look at it! Mook, look at it! <br/>Got him. <br/>You got him. <br/>Oh, a huge fish! Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby! <br/>Oh, we gonna feast, baby! <br/>Oh, we gonna feast, baby! <br/>Oh, we gonna feast, baby! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! How is this? <br/>Can we eat this guy? He's so ugly. <br/>Yeah, but we gonna eat him. <br/>He's ugly. <br/>Ugly. <br/>[laughing]  How can we eat this? We got the big boy. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Oh, yeah! Yeah! <br/>Oh, yeah! <br/>We did it. <br/>Whoo! <br/>[clamoring]  I'll be honest, I-I was pretty upset that we were going back here again to  nothing, but, um, to get a fish? I mean, that just does so much psychologically and mentally. Now you know you can get fish. Now you know you can get food. And these guys, they came from Moto, are really positive and they brought  life, new life to Ravu. <br/>Who's happy? <br/>Wow! Wow! <br/>It's like your first time, isn't it? <br/>That's right. <br/>They caught five fish in less than two hours. Big, huge fish, with teeth. It's over. It is over. The bad times are about to go. I think we're going to do big things. I think we're going to, I think we're going to rock. <br/>That's for sure, man. <br/>Ravu! <br/>Ravu, baby! <br/>Right now, on paper, we're a superpower. A superpower. I said it again. I said it again. We look good. We look good. We look good. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to your first challenge as new tribes? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, let's do it, baby. <br/>Probst: First things first. <br/>Probst: First things first. Michelle. Michelle. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. Today's challenge is going to test how effectively you communicate with your  new tribe mates. Each tribe will be belted in to a large, six-point, sliding hub. By shifting, sliding and adjusting each other, you're going to maneuver  through a field of bamboo poles. As you go, you must pass through five gates. Making things more difficult, the tribe paths intersect, which means the two  tribes could and probably will collide before you reach the finish line. The first tribe to get all their members across the finish line wins immunity. Guaranteed at least one more day in this game. Losers, Tribal Council tonight. Somebody willbe voted out. Everything clear? <br/>Yup. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Give you a minute to  Probst: Give you a minute to strategize, we'll get started. strategize, we'll get started. Here we go. It is the new Moto taking on the new Ravu. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! This challenge is all about communicating, how well you work together. <br/>Okay, y'all slide. <br/>Wait, wait. <br/>Go slide, slide. Go slide, slide. <br/>Probst: Working their way through their first gate. Ravu has cleared their first gate. <br/>Okay, move forward, Ed. This way. <br/>Probst: Michelle getting stuck in the middle of Ravu's hub. A bit of a standstill. Moto gonna let Ravu have this. <br/>Climb on, quick. <br/>Twist. Start to twist. <br/>Move back. <br/>Watch out, watch out! <br/>All right, come on. <br/>That way, that way, that way. <br/>Move up, move up, move up. <br/>Both of them, man. <br/>Go through. <br/>Go, go, Dreamz. Go. <br/>Probst: Ravu is through their second gate. Moto approaching their second gate. <br/>There you go. Okay, I'm in. <br/>Probst: Moto now through their second gate. Ravu with a bit of a lead. <br/>Cassandra, back up. Come in, Cassandra. <br/>Come in, Yau. Come in, Yau. <br/>Come in, Yau-Man. <br/>There you go. We're doing good, baby. <br/>Come back, come back, come back. <br/>Dreamz, move forward. Move this forward. You've got clearance. <br/>Probst: Ravu halfway through gate three. Moto at their third gate. <br/>Good job! <br/>Okay. Go, Yau. Go, Yau, and we all twist. All twist. Ravu. All clear. <br/>Okay, I'm through. <br/>Probst: Moto is through their third gate. Ravu is through theirthird gate. Michelle once again wedged inside the spinning hub of Ravu. <br/>Go. Push. <br/>Probst: Ravu pushing hard against Moto. <br/>Michelle, go on top, go on top of it. <br/>Stop there? <br/>Probst: Michelle trying to maneuver overRavu's pole. <br/>All right. Fine. Go under. <br/>Just stay here. Back up. <br/>Everybody? <br/>Come on, Yau! Come on! Give it to me. Give it to me. Push! Push! <br/>Probst: Nobody wants to give an inch with immunity on the line. <br/>There you go. <br/>Come on. <br/>Come on, Yau. <br/>Probst: Ravu completely tied up in the spinning hub of Moto. <br/>All right, come on in, babe. <br/>Probst: Strange game of Twister taking place. <br/>[groaning]  Pull back. You gotta pull it in. <br/>Hold on. We need him through first. And he's under. <br/>Run. <br/>Probst: Now Moto's free to move on. <br/>Mookie, Mookie, back up. <br/>Probst: After a big impasse, this challenge is back on. <br/>And pull, and pull, and pull. <br/>Probst: Both tribes at their fourth gate. <br/>Back up, back up. <br/>Right here, right here! In the ring. <br/>Probst: Moto is through their fourth gate. <br/>We're through! <br/>Come forward, come forward, come forward. <br/>Probst: Ravu now through their fourth gate. We are neck and neck with one gate left! <br/>No, under it. <br/>No, under it! <br/>Go! Probst: Michelle, blocking Ravu. Moto trying to steal the lead. <br/>Go back! No, the other way, the other way. Push, push through. Now get on the outside. Go, go, go, go. Yau, come in, Yau. <br/>Probst: Dreamz now the one stuck in the middle. <br/>Pull! [all shouting]  Hold up! Aw! <br/>Probst: The challenge has become very physical. Nobody wants to go home tonight. <br/>Get that pole. <br/>Come on, baby! <br/>Probst: You are going to  Probst: You are going to have to work this out. have to work this out. A major roadblock. We are dead even. <br/>Ow! <br/>Come on, take it, man! <br/>Okay, let me in. Okay. <br/>Probst: They've worked it out. Ravu now back on the move. Moto on the move. <br/>Other side, other side! <br/>Probst: Ravu at their fifth gate. Both tribes trying to maneuver through a very narrow passageway on that fifth  gate. <br/>You can go through, Alex. <br/>Probst: Ravu jammed up. Moto with a chance to catch up. <br/>Back up! <br/>Come through. <br/>Probst: Moto making a little progress. <br/>Go! <br/>Probst: Ravu making some progress. <br/>Come through. Let him go first. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man is through. Boo is through. Michelle is through. Earl is through. Cassandra the last member to get through the fifth gate. Moto has cleared their fifth gate. They're heading per the finish. <br/>Go, go. <br/>Probst: Ravu has cleared their fifth gate. They're heading for the finish. We're neck and neck as we go to the finish. Stacy is across the line for Moto. Everybody's got to be across the finish line. <br/>Come on! <br/>Probst: Alex now across for Ravu. It's going to be very close! Moto closer. <br/>Turn, turn! <br/>Get back, get back! <br/>Go! <br/>Probst: Moto wins immunity! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! <br/>That's the way to hold it together, team. <br/>Way to be strong. <br/>Way to be strong. Way to be strong. Way to be strong. <br/>Probst: Moto... congratulations. As a tribe, still Moto is undefeated. You are safe tonight. Ravu, great effort. Unfortunately, same result. Ravu still winless. Tribal Council tonight. One of the six of you is going home. Grab your stuff, head back to Grab your stuff, head back to camp, see you at  Tribal. camp, see you at Tribal. <br/>I got strength now to carry  I got strength now to carry the flag. the flag. <br/>So we lost the challenge again. And now old Cookie has been left by the fire to tend the fire and make the  water while the boys go out hunting and the boys go out hunting and fishing. fishing. So I'm a little bit in panic mode right now. Cinderella, a black, male Cinderella. What kind of whacked-out stuff is that? Can I go fishing with the boys? No. You can't tell underneath this calm demeanor, but right now Anthony is a  turmoil of waves and emotions and worried sick that he's getting voted out  tonight. <br/>Like I said, bro, we made it this far. I don't know how. I'm serious, guys. Like, I like him. He's a good kid. You know, he's not a bad guy. You know, he's not a bad guy. But, like... But, like... So you gotta go backwards before you go forward  sometimes, buddy. sometimes, buddy. Philosophy in the ocean today. Philosophy in the ocean today. <br/>I can tell you now if they bring up a name, it's probably bring up a name,  it's probably going to be me. going to be me. <br/>Anthony talked to me today. He wanted me to tell him if it is him or not, which I don't know if I'm going  to do that either because I pretty much know that it's either going to be him  or Rocky, so... I think Rocky should go because he's so emotionally driven  and he's lazy. He don't do nothing around the camp. Anthony makes the water, you know; he keeps the fire going. But Anthony being weaker than Rocky in challenges is probably going to have a  lot of probably going to have a lot of effect on the rest of the team. effect on the rest of the team. <br/>You know, Rocky's got a lot of emotion. He's got a lot of heart. Sometimes he blows up, man. <br/>You are right about that. <br/>And I can tell you that caused a whole lot of headache. caused a whole lot of headache. <br/>I see. <br/>I see. <br/>Mook, help me with this real quick. So I don't... I don't put out So I don't... I don't put out the fire. the fire. <br/>Ow! I just burned my foot! <br/>Come on! <br/>Chill out. <br/>See what I'm saying, Mook. That's why I wanted you to help That's why I wanted you to help me out, bro. me out, bro. <br/>Anthony! <br/>Rocky has a few screws loose in his head. <br/>Yeah! Huh! It's over! <br/>He yells at people and tells people what to do. I noticed that since I got in here. <br/>Anthony! Which is the drinking water? <br/>I mean, Anthony is his little bitch. "Anthony, make the water. Anthony, put the fire."  Put another log on the fire there, Anthony? <br/>I see myself really far from, from being friends, or liking Rocky a lot. <br/>Oh, this food thing... I might have to eat my portion of bread and cheese,  bro. <br/>And I wouldn't want him making the merger because all he would cause is a lot  of turmoil and you know, a mess. <br/>So I don't know, man. I talked to Alex, and he told me he didn't know who he was going to vote for  yet because of the... Of the Rocky situation. <br/>The thing is, Rocky's really bold though. Rocky's really bold. <br/>But, uh...  Watch out, man. <br/>I'm going to break something. <br/>Just a bit harsh...  No, I mean, I'll tell you the truth, man. My vote right now, it will be 50-50 right now between and you Rocky. So, but I mean, this is... That's my decision, man, and it's not going to  change until we get there, so... we get there, so...  It's all good. <br/>It's all good. <br/>Am I going to miss Anthony when he's gone? We had a couple of good times, you know, when we started like not really... Not  really, no. If he had a drop of social skills, it might-- it might make this decision  hard. But he hasn't had any since day one. Anthony, where is the flint? And then when he tries to, like, finagle his way through things, he has to go  like, go around-- no offense-- like a girl. Like a little female. [ whining ] Whining and trying to work on your sympathy. You know what I mean? You know what I mean? It doesn't work. It doesn't work. <br/>Probst: Edgardo, tell me your first impressions when you got to Ravu Beach  and saw your new home. <br/>I thought it was going to be a worse place, you know, no crabs, no anything. So I was like, you know, for 15 days it wasn't even really, like you know,  trying to survive, so in my mind I was like now I'm going to actually start  playing Survivor. <br/>Probst: Mookie, tell me about today. After you're done talking about the challenge, you got to get back to life,  right? <br/>Yeah, we got back from the challenge, and right away we're hungry, so Dreamz  and Rocky, Edgardo, Alex and I go out fishing over on some other part. Anthony is working the fire, boiling some water, filling up the canteens. Everyone is doing everything, you know, so it's... it's pretty good. <br/>Probst: So, Anthony, does it concern you at all that with Tribal Council  looming, the entire tribe is somewhere else, and you're boiling water? <br/>You know, I'm not going to lie. I was concerned. I mean, you don't know what everybody else is saying because you're isolated,  but you do what you get assigned to do. <br/>To be honest with you, Anthony, this is the best advice I can give you. Put your cards on the table. If you're upset the way you're getting treated, you got to put your foot down  and say, "Hey, guy, you know, I don't mind doing the fire. I need help real quick and then do what you want." Let people know  what's going through your mind. Because if you don't tell them, how are they going to know? You know what I mean? No one's a mind reader. At least I'm not. I don't know about you boys. So maybe if you take some of those words and you can use them later on in  your life or tomorrow or the next day or ten minutes from now, whenever you  want to, you know what I mean? <br/>Probst: Anthony, pretty candid advice, and still, you're just sitting there. What is so hard for you about speaking up and owning your own space? <br/>You know, I tried to own my space early on, and, you know what, I got... I  got knocked back. <br/>You can't give up, bro. You can't give up. <br/>Who says I gave up? <br/>You get knocked back, you stand up and take another knock in the mouth. You can't back down from nobody at any point in time in your life 'cause you  won't get respect. That's the problem. <br/>Rock, let me tell you...  I'm trying to help you out. I'm giving a life lesson here, buddy. <br/>I'm going to tell you the truth-- the only person that I really have not felt  I've gotten any respect from has really been you. <br/>No, guy, you got to respect... first you got to comfortable...  I do respect myself. <br/>You have to be comfortable in your own skin. You're not. You can't sit up here and tell these people how you feel or back at camp or  anything like that. You have poor social skills. <br/>Oh, I got poor social skills? <br/>You have poor social skills, bro, yes! <br/>Dude, Please, please, please, Rocky. <br/>I'm not going to debate with you. I'm trying to help you out. <br/>Do you know anything about me? <br/>No, because you don't tell me nothing, bro. <br/>Have you asked? Have you asked me? <br/>Please don't raise your voice in my ear. No, guy, here's the thing: I talk to people who talk to me; I sit down like  men. <br/>You're talking I'm not a man again. <br/>I didn't say that. Grow a spine, bro. <br/>You've done it before, Rocky. <br/>Seriously, like a jellyfish. Toughen up. I don't know what's going on in your mind, guy, but you act like a little  girl sometimes, okay? You're effeminate. <br/>Oh, I'm effeminate. <br/>Extremely effeminate, yes. <br/>I'm sorry, please. <br/>Toughen up, toughen up. <br/>No, no, no. <br/>Toughen up. <br/>This is why I don't say anything. <br/>Keep going, man! Fight for what's yours! Take the skirt off a little bit; let's go! <br/>Probst: Alex, why were your hands buried in your head. Why is this bad? <br/>You know, I was thinking to myself, wow, that is some tough love. I feel bad because I think what he said might have hurt Anthony's feelings. To be honest, that would hurt my feelings. So I just felt bad for the guy. And that's... all I felt was empathy, that's it. <br/>Probst: Anthony, Rocky could easily just kiss your ass and say you're a good  guy, Anthony, don't worry about it, and write your name down. What are you feeling right now? <br/>I appreciate all of the advice about standing up for myself. What I don't appreciate is the name-calling. <br/>Probst: Do you want to be in this game? <br/>Yes, I want to be in this game! You know why I want to be in this game? Because I worked for so much. I've popped myself, hurt myself in these challenges. I held back from myself for giving people of myself, I held back from giving  Rock of myself. You know why I haven't said anything? 'Cause I want to make sure that the team works so we can win a freaking  challenge. I was trying to keep people cool, keep people calm, keep people happy, but  you know what, screw that. If it means I have to piss people off to stay here, which doesn't make any  friggin' sense to me, then fine, so be it. But I'm here, all right? I'll be brutally honest with people. But I need to be here. I deserve to be here. I want it. And if you guys want it, you need it, you want to keep me here because I'll  help you get there. there. Oh, I'll help you get there. Oh, I'll help you get there. <br/>Probst: Okay, it is time to vote. vote. Mookie, you're up. Mookie, you're up. <br/>I was getting respect back before you got... man. before you got... man. And, uh... watch your mouth. And, uh... watch your mouth. <br/>It's time to go.

The job you do in welcoming her will certainly have a big impact on how well  this tribe does. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night.

So she should be worried. <br/>Bye, Yau. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man continues to search for the hidden idol. <br/>I'm always the target but if I have the immunity idol, I can go quite far. <br/>Probst: And things get rough. <br/>Probst: And things get rough. <br/>Follow that ramp...  Follow that ramp...  I'm a little pissed off. I'm a lot pissed off. I'm mad at myself for apparently not screaming to the world, being a jerk. That's what you need to prove that you're out for a million dollars. Regardless of what Rocky says, I have great social skills. I'm not what was wrong with that tribe. It was Mookie and James. Those are the problem with Ravu and that's why they're losing. They're going to continue to lose until both those guys are lose until both  those guys are gone.
