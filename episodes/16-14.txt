<br/> <br/>Jeff Probst: 36 days ago, ten fans of Survivorwere pitted  against ten of their favorite players from seasons past.  <br/>You could be a fan of the Boston Red Sox, man, but you  don't want to play against the Boston Red Sox. You're going to get your ass  handed to you. handed to you.  <br/>Jeff: Let's get it on.  <br/>Jeff: Let's get it on. The tropical paradise of  Micronesia...  <br/>Got a big old four-foot shark.  <br/>Jeff: ...proved to be both bountiful and brutal. The  castaways were unexpectedly battered by storms on a daily basis.  <br/>You watch this show at home, and when they show the rain,  they show it for, like, 30 seconds. They're not showing that you're standing  in the rain for five, six hours straight.  <br/>Jeff: The conditions were so harsh that one castaway  quit.  <br/>I can't be here one more minute. I can't take it.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Jeff: Throughout the game, injuries piled up like never  before... Our injury tally so far, Penner has a busted-up knee, Parvati has a  busted-up lip, Ami has a tweaked knee. ...forcing out two of the game's  strongest players.  <br/>I can only recommend, for the sake of his leg and his  life, that he leaves the game now. It's not going to get better.  <br/>Oh, god bless it.  <br/>Jeff: Let's get you out of here and get you to a hospital.  It was the first time ever that three players left without being voted out.  But the game continued. An early alliance was formed between Amanda, Parvati,  and Cirie.  <br/>All right, ladies, I have both of you guys' words that  it's us three to the end.  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: The three women stayed true to each other throughout  the entire game, but Parvati made some side deals on her own.  <br/>I might just go ahead and pull in Natalie and Alexis and  take them with me and Amanda and Cirie. Everyone else, they're dead to me.  <br/>Jeff: All the women banded together to form a  superalliance which took control of the game.  <br/>What is the plan?  <br/>Final five girls.  <br/>Jeff: The first thing on their agenda was to blindside the  biggest threat.  <br/>This is, like, the perfect opportunity to get rid of Ozzy,  because he'll never see it coming.  <br/>Jeff: He had the hidden immunity idol, but he didn't play  it. Ozzy, the tribe has spoken. But Ozzy's exit was just the But Ozzy's exit  was just the beginning. beginning.  <br/>It's like the black widow brigade-- all the girls spinning  the guys around as much as we can until they don't know which way is up, and  then we're devouring them one at a time.  <br/>Jeff: What happened next was an unprecedented series of  blindsides. Jason had the idol, but the women convinced him that he was safe.  Jason. So he didn't play it. At the following tribal council, because Erik  had immunity, the women were forced to vote out one of their own. They picked  Amanda.  <br/>Pretty much everyone here has told me they're voting for  me tonight.  <br/>Jeff: But when she produced the hidden immunity  idol...  <br/>I got it!  <br/>Jeff: ...the vote bounced back to Alexis. Alexis, you need  to bring me your torch. And when Erik won immunity again...  <br/>Nat, tell him if he were to give you the necklace that  would redeem him, and we would vote for Amanda.  <br/>Who would fall for that?  <br/>I want to give individual immunity to Natalie.  <br/>Jeff: ...they pulled off the biggest blindside in Survivor  history.  <br/>You officially go down as the dumbest survivor ever.  <br/>Jeff: Erik, the tribe has spoken. Three days left in this  game. Who knows what is going to happen? Now four are left. Cirie...  <br/>In this game for me, it's all about who I think I can  trust. And if I feel that I can trust you, then I'm willing to go all the way  with you. But if I don't trust you, then you can't believe a word I tell  you.  <br/>Jeff: ...Natalie...  <br/>I'm in game mode, and now I'm actually having a lot more  fun. I'm getting to be more of myself, which is proving to be pretty ruthless  and pretty stone-cold bitch, and pretty cutthroat.  <br/>Jeff: ...Amanda...  <br/>This is where the game gets interesting. This season I  have developed more personal relationships than I did in China, and this  game, I played completely loyal and just fought my way to the end.  <br/>Jeff: ...Parvati.  <br/>Coming back and playing really aggressively, and pretty  much no holds barred for me. So I haven't been here miserable going through  all this crap to not win this game.  <br/>Jeff: Find out tonight who will outlast all the rest to  will outlast all the rest to become the sole survivor. become the sole  survivor.  <br/>âª Final four, final four final four, final four. âª  <br/>When Erik paused, I was like... I know. And I was like...  And he goes, "Well, this is risky." And I was like, "It's in  the bag. It is in the bag!" Everyone has fallen into our trap. Everyone.  And it's the same trap over and over and over again. And every single person  keeps falling into it.  <br/>When I wrote his name down, I said, "My mama always  told me you might not be able to beat them with these but you can always beat  them with this." We couldn't beat Erik at anything. But now that's all  taken care of. Erik's somewhere having a sandwich, and we're going to  continue with the game.  <br/>That's four back-to-back blindsides which you girls have managed  to evade every single one of them.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Like, let's see what happens  <br/>Like, let's see what happens next. next.

How long have you been up for?  <br/>I don't know. Probably an hour.  <br/>Did you sleep good?  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>We were talking about Erik.  <br/>Oh, it's just tearing my heart out that there aren't any  guys around here. Can't you see the tears in my eyes?  <br/>These guys just walk right into the Venus flytrap, and  they get eaten alive.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Heist number four...  <br/>In a row.  <br/>...goes off without a hitch.  <br/>I'm going to check and see if my money is still in my  pocket around y'all. I can't trust you. I'm nervous around y'all. I'm nervous  around y'all.  <br/>I'm nervous around you.  <br/>I'm nervous around you.  <br/>Oh, my god! That's so many! Nice job, Parv.  <br/>I haven't missed the guys here for one second. I love  having this group of girls here, Just chilling, hanging out, without the big  egos running around and the guys trying to, you know, provide and look cool  in front of the ladies. I love just me and the girls.  <br/>This has been a really hard season.  <br/>It's been so hard.  <br/>Because all the freaking girls are smart girls in this  season.  <br/>I'm not kidding. And we beat them out with our brains. I  can't believe we beat those guys.  <br/>Oh, my god. I'm just so thankful to be here.  <br/>I'm so thankful that you're here. I feel like you have a  way of, like, convincing people, and they're like, "You're so  right." You really should... you really should swallow your pride and  ask for whatever you want all the time.  <br/>I know. I feel I live out of fear in my normal life a lot.  I'm so scared of people saying no, so I don't ask.  <br/>Yeah. But your life could be so much better if you just  ask for things that you want.  <br/>I know.  <br/>You know?  <br/>I know. My position at this point, I'm the only fan left.  They're all favorites. They all started on a tribe together. But I've  definitely made a personal bond and connection with Parvati. We get each  other. We have great conversation. So I think we complement each other  well.  <br/>Honestly, I think the people that you encounter when you  do things like this, like, the people that you're with, you have to know that  they are there for a reason.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>You know? And there's a reason that you and I are here  together. We have a one-in-four shot of winning a million dollars right  now.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Unbelievable.  <br/>But everyone here has earned their spot in the final  three, you know?  <br/>Absolutely.  <br/>Everyone here has played a damn good game.  <br/>Yeah. I think Parvati is an ally for me in this game. My  conversations and my heartto-hearts with Parvati and our great connection--  does it benefit me at all if we're closer than not? closer than not? Of  course. Of course.  <br/>Tree mail!  <br/>What does it say?  <br/>Yeah, I was hoping for food.  <br/>Me, too.  <br/>Reward or immunity? Does it say?  <br/>"Indeed you've accomplished a noble task. You've made  it the final four. To climb the heights of victory, you need to scramble once  more."  <br/>What?  <br/>It's immunity. Today?  <br/>Wow.  <br/>I am not happy.  <br/>We're thinking that winning this challenge is pretty much  guaranteed final three. So we have to beat Natalie. I mean, we love the fact  that it's all women, but being that it's all women, one of us has to it's all  women, one of us has to go. go.  <br/>Jeff: Four ladies feeling oh so good about themselves. You  guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?  <br/>Yep.  <br/>Jeff: First things first. Natalie, I'll take back that  Natalie, I'll take back that necklace. necklace. Once again, immunity is back  up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will start on a very small perch at  the top of a 20-foot pole in the water. On my go, you will use a bucket to  gather water that you will then pour into a bamboo chute. As the water fills  up the chute, it will raise a set of keys. You'll take those keys, you'll  swim back to shore and use them to unlock a chest containing 16 individually  shaped ladder rungs. The first person to correctly assemble their ladder,  climb to the top, and raise their flag, wins immunity, guaranteed a  onein-three shot at winning this game. Make sense?  <br/>Yep.  <br/>Yep.  <br/>Jeff: We'll draw for position. position. We'll get  started. We'll get started. Here we go, for immunity and a guaranteed spot in  the final three. Survivors ready? Go. Going to pull up that bucket full of  water, and then pour it down that bamboo chute. The more water you get in,  the faster you will raise those keys faster you will raise those keys up to  where you can grab them. up to where you can grab them. Natalie having a lot  of success. Parvati got most of it in the chute. Doesn't matter how fast you  pull up the water if you don't pour up the water if you don't pour it in the  chute. it in the chute. Natalie doing a great job. Natalie doing a great job.  Can't quite reach her keys. Can't quite reach her keys. Parvati and Natalie  neck and Parvati and Natalie neck and neck right now. neck right now. Natalie  has her keys. Natalie has her keys. She's in the water. She's in the water.  Parvati very close. Parvati reaching for her keys. Parvati unclips. She's in  the water. Got to get to shore and open that chest. Amanda reaching for those  keys. Can't do it. Going to take another bucket of water. Natalie and Parvati  with a big lead at this point. lead at this point. Both opening their chests  up. Both opening their chests up. Amanda has her set of keys. Got to unclip.  Got to unclip. She's in the water. She's in the water. Cirie, is it close  enough? Cirie reaches for the keys. Cirie has her keys! Get in that water.  Everybody is in this. Natalie continues to extend her lead. This ladder will  take some time to assemble. Only one person going to walk away from here with  immunity. The other three vulnerable at tonight's tribal council. You have 16  ladder rungs. Each ladder rung is individually shaped and will only go into  one slot on that ladder. If you have to force it, it's not right. If you have  a lot of play, it's not right. 16 different options, but it 16 different  options, but it only goes together one way. only goes together one way.  Amanda appears to be making some progress. Parvati's got some rungs in her  ladder. Natalie and Cirie trying to make sure they're right. Merely getting  to the top is not enough. Amanda making a lot of progress. If she's right,  that's a big lead. Parvati skipping up ahead. Putting some of the higher  ladder rungs in first. Cirie is working her way up methodically from the  bottom. Natalie having a little trouble with this puzzle. Amanda pulling away  from the pack. At this point, it is Amanda's challenge to lose. challenge to  lose. She has a huge lead. She has a huge lead. Amanda can't get that last  rung in. Something's not right. Amanda going now rung by rung trying to  figure out where she's off. Natalie getting closer. Amanda swapping pieces  out. Amanda swapping pieces out. Immunity so close. Immunity so close. Amanda  thinks she has it, and she does. Amanda wins immunity!  <br/>Good job, girl.  <br/>Good job.  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>Good job, girl. That was tough.  <br/>Jeff: Amanda, come on over. Congratulations.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Jeff: Guaranteed a one-inthree shot at winning this game  and the million bucks that goes with it. Natalie, Cirie, Parvati, after 37  hard-fought days, one of you will not make it to the final. Figure out who  that's going to be tonight at tribal council. Grab your stuff, head out. Grab  your stuff, head out. See you at tribal. See you at tribal.  <br/>The only reason you beat me is because your legs are  longer than mine.  <br/>Right.  <br/>Me, too.  <br/>I was right hot on your trail.  <br/>Oh, I know, girl.  <br/>We all were.  <br/>I'm in the final three. I can't believe it. I'm really,  like... I'm ecstatic. And that's, like, twice in a row. And this time I have  played my game so different, and I feel so much better about it. much better  about it.  <br/>We could set Gloria free.  <br/>We could set Gloria free.  <br/>You know, they always talk about the lowest man on the  totem pole. I do indeed feel like the low woman on the totem pole. But am I  just going to tuck my tail between my legs and scurry out of here and say,  "Bye, guys, well, it was great, I'm going home"? No, I'm going to  explore all my options. If Gloria is anything like the women on this camp,  she'll mate with that dude and then rip his neck off.  <br/>Oh, that's funny.  <br/>I'm dealing women who are as smart as I am. So if I go in  and I'm hustling and I'm shaking and I'm moving and I'm stressing, they're  going to see right through it. So I think if I'm calm, cool, and collected  there's a way to weasel in and communicate with them in a way that may seem  them in a way that may seem reasonable. reasonable.  <br/>This sucks. I hate when it gets to this point. Why can't  we all just stay? Why can't they have a final four?  <br/>That would be cool.  <br/>I don't know, Natty, girl. I don't know. Have you promised  anybody your vote? Oh, good.  <br/>No.  <br/>Good.  <br/>I believe Cirie is quite nervous as far as jury votes are  concerned. I could use this to address Parvati to help me out. It's kind of a  little glimmer at the end of the tunnel, a little light, because I do firmly  believe that Parvati would go believe that Parvati would go out on a limb for  me. out on a limb for me.  <br/>Huh?  <br/>How good of a shot do we have to win this, do you  think?  <br/>Huge.  <br/>Yeah?  <br/>You and I? I think it's between you and I.  <br/>Really?  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>Definitely.  <br/>Definitely.  <br/>It's been kind of our plan from pretty much the beginning  to have me, Parv and Cirie in the final three. But I think Cirie is  definitely a threat as far as swaying votes from the jury one way or the  other. And I don't want Natalie to go. I think, you know, she definitely  deserves to be here. I think she's played a good game. Cirie, she knows that  if Natalie would have won, Nat would have voted with me and you and Cirie  would have been gone.  <br/>True.  <br/>I don't know who I'm voting for tonight. I mean, it's  hard. It's far in the game. You know, it's not easy. You know everyone is  still playing the game at this point. It would be stupid not to still be  playing the game.  <br/>I give Natalie so much credit.  <br/>Me, too.  <br/>Cirie got lucky to be with  <br/>Cirie got lucky to be with us. us. us.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>You okay?  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>I was like... "No. You're asking me this right now  You're asking me this right now because..." because..."  <br/>I love Natalie to death, and I think she's a lesser threat  as far as jury votes than Cirie. And now the time has come where it's, like,  I could switch it up now, and then we have our biggest jury threat out of the  game. But, seriously, in this game, and how this game's been played all these  women are so crafty, I wouldn't put it past any single one of us to work some  kind of deal out and make it to the three.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I could be going home tonight. They could have made a deal  with Natalie and decided, "You know what? We like you better. Cirie's  out." And smiling in my face. I saw their work already. We duped so many  people.... We duped so many people....  <br/>...with straight faces.  <br/>...with straight faces.  <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Eliza,  Ozzy, Jason, James, Alexis, and Erik, voted out at Alexis, and Erik, voted  out at the last tribal council. the last tribal council. So we have a final  four consisting of only women. And all of you women have been involved in  another first-- four straight blindsides. Natalie, after the performance from  the four of you at the last tribal council, you all should be nominated for a  Survivor Academy Award. It was masterful to watch.  <br/>No disrespect to anyone, but it went down seamlessly. We  achieved an impossible task. So it was a great feeling.  <br/>Jeff: So after four straight blindsides, what's the  feeling going into tonight's vote?  <br/>I think at this point, the four of us respect each other  enough that I don't think there would be a blindside. I would pray for a  blindside on some level. Like now it would actually benefit me better than  all the other four.  <br/>Jeff: Amanda, how concerned are you tonight that you know  exactly what's happening?  <br/>At this point, Jeff, I have no idea what's going on. I  mean, how many times does a blindside have to happen before you figure out  that you know nothing about what's going on at all? I'm fairly confident that  I know what's going to happen tonight, but I can't be certain.  <br/>Jeff: Parvati, it seems to me only a fool would say  anything with confidence at tribal council. All you have to do is look across  at Ozzy, and Jason, and Alexis, and Erik. They were all certain they weren't  going home.  <br/>Yeah, I think this has been the craziest, messiest, most  strategic game in the history of Survivor. So for anyone to feel confident,  it's ludicrous. But I can't read anyone's mind, and I don't know what anyone  else is thinking but myself.  <br/>Jeff: Amanda, have you guys talked about, "What do we  do when there are only three people left?" Or have you been assuming,  "That's all I've got to do is just get to final three and I'm good to  go"?  <br/>No one here, I think I can honestly say that, is expecting  a final two. At this point in the game, it would take us for another  whirlwind.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie, how would it change the game if you knew it  was a final two?  <br/>I mean, it is nerve-wracking to think it could be a final  two, because that makes me feel like, once again, I'm on the bottom of the  alliance, which is not a good place to be, Jeff.  <br/>I just have a question-- when did you ever think you were  on the bottom of the alliance?  <br/>No, no, no, from the five, when I started with you, Ozzy,  James, and Parvati, basically, it's unspoken that I'm on the bottom. Ozzy  wanted you four to be in the final four. So where does that place me when  we're going to the five? That makes me fifth.  <br/>I'm talking about after the merge. Like, when have you  felt on the bottom?  <br/>Always.  <br/>Always?  <br/>Between us three? It's obvious, because not one person in  any alliance has ever said, "I won't vote for Cirie." You have  said, "I won't vote for" certain people. She has said, "I  won't vote for you." So that clearly places me at the bottom of the  alliance.  <br/>I'm just wondering.  <br/>And I'm explaining how I feel that way. I would be foolish  not to think I would be foolish not to think that. that.  <br/>Jeff: Natalie, you're holding back a big grin.  <br/>I think at this point, anything's an opportunity. You  know, I'm just letting them duke it out, and may the best woman win.  <br/>Jeff: All right, let's get to the vote. Amanda, you have  the immunity necklace, you're not planning on giving it to anyone else, are  you?  <br/>No.  <br/>Jeff: You cannot vote for Amanda. Everybody else is fair  game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Amanda, you're up. Amanda,  you're up.  <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the  <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are  read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the  tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes.  First vote, Cirie. First vote, Cirie. Natalie. One vote Natalie, one vote One  vote Natalie, one vote Cirie. Cirie. Natalie. Two votes Natalie, one vote Two  votes Natalie, one vote Cirie. Cirie. 14th person voted out and the seventh  member of our jury, Natalie. That's three. That's enough. That's enough. You  need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring  me your torch. Natalie, the tribe has spoken. Natalie, the tribe has spoken.  Natalie, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. Well,  once again you have survived the vote and made it to the final three.  Congratulations. Grab your torches, head back to camp. camp. Good night. Good  night.  <br/>I have to say that I am pretty happy with the way that I  played the game. I was the last fan standing. And I feel proud of the group  of girls they finished with. I respect the way that you guys played the game  with me. played the game with me. So thank you. So thank you.  <br/>That was a weird tribal tonight, wasn't it?  <br/>I don't think I've ever been so exhausted in my entire  life. so exhausted in my entire life.  <br/>You and me both.  <br/>You and me both.  <br/>What am I doing?  <br/>You were trying to make us look so awful at tribal.  <br/>How? You asked me how I think I'm on the bottom of an  alliance, and I explained to you every single alliance that I've been in how  I'm on the bottom.  <br/>That's bull[ no audio] Just be real.  <br/>How is it bull [ no audio]? That's not game. That's real  facts. That's exactly what this is. I should be...  <br/>Because in the five, how are you on the outs?  <br/>Because you're snuggled up over there with James, she's  snuggled up over there with Ozzy. Most of the time y'all four are together.  If you were me, what would you feel? I mean, be me for a minute. And because  I said it out loud, you're upset? With this alliance with y'all two, she told  me she couldn't vote you. So that makes me at the bottom of this alliance.  Have any one of you ever said, "I can't vote Cirie out?"  <br/>How do you know?  <br/>Yes or no? I'm asking you.  <br/>How do you know?  <br/>Have I talked to you about final two? I feel that I've  been at the bottom of every single alliance.  <br/>I just don't see that, and I haven't seen that. I haven't  seen that the whole game.  <br/>You're not me. You're not me. That's why you can't see  it.  <br/>I can't understand you when you're screaming at me.  <br/>Okay, I'm not screaming.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>I can't explain it any more. I don't know how else to say  it.  <br/>Yeah, I know. I mean, it makes sense.  <br/>I know. I'm sorry.  <br/>I'm sorry for yelling at you, but don't...  <br/>No, I know. I'm just...  <br/>...accuse me of stuff that I'm...  <br/>I wasn't trying to accuse you. It came out very badly, and  I'm sorry. I'm just on my breaking point I'm just on my breaking point right  now. right now.  <br/>I know.  <br/>You have two more days.  <br/>I know.  <br/>Let me give you a hug, because this is pitiful for us to  make it this far and then you be...  <br/>I know, I'm sorry.  <br/>No, it's all right. It's all right.  <br/>I didn't mean it like that. I just kind of broke down and  I started yelling at Cirie about stupid things that I don't even know why I  yelled. And it's...I feel like I've been doing this forever, you know?  Straight from China, I come here, and it just... I just can't take it. I  almost lost it when Jeff mentioned that there might be a final two, and I  lost it.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>There's no way it would be a final two. There's no  way.  <br/>Yeah, don't say that again, Parv, because you've been  wrong every time. You don't comfort me by saying that. It's been the plan  from day one for Parvati, Amanda, myself to be final three, and it would just  break my heart to find out it's going to be a final two. So I want to  celebrate, but there's, like, that hint in the back of my mind-- don't get  falsely happy and then find out this is not the end of it.  <br/>It's the final three. Everybody just needs to chill  out.  <br/>Did you find a machete? Because all that yelling makes  Because all that yelling makes me thirsty. me thirsty.  <br/>38 days. I really don't think I will ever touch a coconut  again.  <br/>We need a tree mail here.  <br/>Relax.  <br/>I am ecstatic to be here in the final three with these two  girls. At least we assume it's a final three. It's been a long road, and we  feel very blessed to be here with each other. Come on out.  <br/>Come on, Gloria.  <br/>We're celebrating by setting our mascot free, Gloria.  She's our last chicken standing.  <br/>Get out of there!  <br/>Yay!  <br/>Uh-oh! Rather than try to kill Gloria and have her  flopping around in misery, we decided we can not eat. We only have a couple  of days left. Let Gloria go. She might not leave here. This is her home. She's  making a nest to lay the damn egg.  <br/>Unfortunately, Gloria doesn't want to leave camp. She's,  like, hanging around. She's like a pet dog now. I guess she doesn't realize  that this is over. this is over. It's a done deal. It's a done deal.  <br/>We're the craftiest survivors of all time, to be  modest.  <br/>Nice. Nice.  <br/>What is it? It doesn't look like food.  <br/>No.  <br/>What? Oh, my...  <br/>It looks like a challenge. Freaking paddle. All right.  "Congratulations, final three. You have done what 17 of your fellow  tribesmen and women could not. Today you will honor their memories before  proceeding to your final immunity challenge. Get into your boat and head out  to Exile Island. There you will find the torches of your fallen comrades.  Reflect upon them as they each had a part in getting you to this point.  You'll then proceed to your final immunity challenge."  <br/>Oh, my god.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>My heart just dropped.  <br/>All right, let's go, ladies.  <br/>We got tree mail today, and we thought there was going to  be like, food, you know, for the final three. And it's another immunity  challenge. It's like, when is it going to end, you know? Like, there's only  so much you can take, and then someone has to leave now, like, after  everything. I am so tight with these girls. Like, this just sucks Like, this  just sucks completely. completely.  <br/>It's never ending.  <br/>I feel sick.  <br/>Me, too. The fact that it's a final two and not a final  three was almost poetic. I mean, we've been blindsiding people left and  right, and essentially we got blindsided. We thought we had it made. I guess,  you know, what goes around comes around.  <br/>Okay. ...regroup, get it together.  <br/>One more time.  <br/>I need to regroup. Now we have to kick it back into gear  and get ready for this immunity challenge today. And for me, it's taken me  down a peg. Like, I feel a little bit humbled. But I think the rites of  passage will give me a little perspective, because it's a chance for us to  honor everyone that we fought so hard to beat, and I think we all want to  give those people credit for being such strong competitors and for such  strong competitors and for not making it easy on us. not making it easy on  us.  <br/>I can't feel bad. Look how far I made it. I mean, we  started out with 20 people. And they were all hard-core players, and would  love to be here right now. So I want to tip my hat to them and say, you know,  "Good job. and say, you know, "Good job. I beat you, but good  job." I beat you, but good job."  <br/>Oh, thank god. He was actually kind of a decent guy while  he lasted. Let's do it.  <br/>I consider myself the cerebral assassin of Survivor. And  I'm not going at 100%, I'm not playing. So, you know, to go out on my own  terms, I kind of protected the legacy of Jonny Fairplay. the legacy of Jonny  Fairplay. So I'm very happy with that. So I'm very happy with that.  <br/>Oh, Mary. Didn't really know Mary.  <br/>That's probably the worst thing that could ever happen to  somebody on Survivor,is being one of the first people voted out of your  tribe. Maybe I was a strong player and they saw me as a threat, but I really  felt like just a ton of bricks hit me, and game over.  <br/>Yau-Man. Cirie's fiercest competitor.  <br/>That's only reason he had to go so early is because he was  such a great player.  <br/>When I first walked in and someone said that I'm one of  the most likable players, I think that pretty much sets me apart as a big  target. Also, my problem, I know, is that I don't have that, you know killer  instinct to go up against some of these other people. But even though I got  voted out so early, it's still quite a fun experience.  <br/>Oh, Mikey.  <br/>Good old Mikey B. He was a fierce competitor.  <br/>It hurts. It hurts to get sent home that early in the  game. I was having fun out there, and I just wanted to continue to fight. But  it is a life-changing experience. And it reminds you that life is good.  <br/>Joel. The big guy.  <br/>Truck was pretty intense.  <br/>That's exactly the words I was going to use. He was  intense.  <br/>I went in with the goal to play the game hard, and I feel  like I did that. But my Survivorexperience should be summed up as failure. My  goal was to be there at the end. And I didn't reach the goal. I failed.  <br/>Jonathan, Jonathan, Jonathan.  <br/>Jonathan is a smooth talker. He was tough, though, in this  game, man. I give him props.  <br/>Yeah, he wouldn't have quit for anything.  <br/>Nothing.  <br/>If he hadn't been taken out on medical, he never would  have quit.  <br/>That's so sad.  <br/>Leaving the game for medical reasons, I was able to leave  with my head held high, no animosity towards anyone, and there's nothing that  I could have done about it. It is something extremely special, and I'll  always hold this near and dear, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience I  got to do twice.  <br/>Oh, Chet!  <br/>My buddy.  <br/>You know, I have to say the chickens have not been the  same since Chet left.  <br/>My Survivorexperience was something I only dreamt of happening.  Even though I was told I was going out first I went out seventh in a  beautiful way, as far as I'm concerned. Everybody who was praised for their  strength, praised for their agility, praised for their athletic ability, I  outlasted them.  <br/>I loved Kathy.  <br/>She was...  <br/>She was a colorful character.  <br/>Yeah, to say the least.  <br/>I am in awe of every person who's ever played the game of  Survivor. It's the most difficult thing I've ever done. Childbirth, I thought  that was tough. Nah. I'd rather whip out eight more kids in ten minutes than  ever do this again. That's how much harder Survivoris.  <br/>Oh, Tracy.  <br/>She was... you know, I think she was underestimated in  this game as a physical competitor.  <br/>Even if it's 20 days, 20 days may seem like not a lot of  time to a lot of people, but when the rain is hitting you for nine and a half  hours, you just can't be that same person any longer because you have just  you and the elements. I am not the same person any longer. And I don't think  I ever want to And I don't think I ever want to be again. be again.  <br/>Ami, Ami, Ami.  <br/>You know, I loved Ami.  <br/>I did, too. Ami loved everyone.  <br/>This game, I was so much more sensitive than I was the  first game. I've learned the balance for me of vulnerability and strength. Of  walking into a situation and being strong with who I am, and knowing that I  don't need the feedback of other people to know feedback of other people to  know I'm okay with who I am. I'm okay with who I am.  <br/>Oh, Eliza. My arch rival that I had to compete with for 22  days.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Eliza put up a good fight in this game.  <br/>Oh, yeah. The last tribal council...  <br/>She went down...  <br/>She went down swinging.  <br/>...in a blaze of glory.  <br/>Yes, she did.  <br/>I was the underdog. I was on the outs almost from the  start, because I didn't really have an alliance with anyone. And so I knew  that I was on the bottom, and trying to work every angle, which is my game,  which is the only game I know how to play. play. And I think I did a good  job. And I think I did a good job.  <br/>Ozzy!  <br/>Ozzy!  <br/>Oh, Oz!  <br/>I think he's the most wellrounded player ever in  Survivor.  <br/>And you like him.  <br/>That's why he had to go.  <br/>You can carry his torch. I'll let you carry it.  <br/>To a certain point, your time out in Survivordoes define  you to a large degree. It's like a chance to really search your soul and get  to know who you are, and what you're made of. I knew that I had to trust  people this time around to make it anywhere, and that was what ended up being  my downfall. But my relationship with Amanda was worth more to me than any  amount of money.  <br/>Good old Jason.  <br/>He gave Ozzy a ride for his money, too.  <br/>He beat Ozzy twice.  <br/>I came out here as a strong competitor and a good  provider, and nobody really saw that because I think everybody was just  focused on Ozzy. So it's a bit comforting knowing that Ozzy and I both went  out in the same way. It shows that I'm just as good of a competitor and  provider as of a competitor and provider as Ozzy. Ozzy.  <br/>Oh, James, my little cuddle bug.  <br/>He was honest.  <br/>Yeah, he was a straight shooter.  <br/>I'd much rather have been voted out, because it's like,  closure. With a finger injury, it kills me. But the trials I had to go through  with them girls really was quite a test. I mean, I'm not a bully, but I  surely don't like anybody telling me what to do. So, I mean, I really had to  let go and go within myself to calm down.  <br/>Alexis.  <br/>Alexis.  <br/>You know, if, Alexis made it this far, she would  definitely be hard to beat.  <br/>Yeah, Alexis was a charmer.  <br/>Yes, definitely.  <br/>I felt like I always had this kind of split between, like,  the super-competitive tomboy, but then the super-nice southern hospitality  girl. So in a weird way, I feel like I came into this game a little girl and  I got to grow up and left a woman.  <br/>Poor Erik. I'm sorry he had to be the victim of the  women's wrath. But play with fire, you'll get burned.  <br/>I don't think you can play this game without changing as a  person. I mean, I've seen so much in so few days that I've never, ever seen  in my life. I've seen these women here, and they are vicious. I mean, they  are cutthroat. They are very tough, and there's a lot of strength in them.  And it's opened my eyes a little bit about the way that women are bit about  the way that women are and the way that they operate. and the way that they  operate.  <br/>Natalie.  <br/>Aww. The last fan in Survivor.  <br/>Good on you, girl.  <br/>Good on you, baby.  <br/>If the woman has the opportunity to think, she will outwit  a man. They may outbrawn a woman, but a woman will definitely outwit a man,  hands down, every time. I think I learned a lot about myself, and right now,  I'm kind myself, and right now, I'm kind of my biggest fan. of my biggest  fan.  <br/>Jeff: Welcome to your final immunity challenge. You ready  to get to it?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Jeff: All right, Amanda, I'm  <br/>Jeff: All right, Amanda, I'm take back the necklace. take  back the necklace. For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs. For  today's immunity challenge, you each have a long wooden cylinder that has  been cut into several pieces. In the center is a slot on which rests a metal  ball. On go, you'll pick up the first piece using two handles, balancing the  ball. Every five minutes, as the challenge continues, you will add more  pieces, making it more difficult to hold on to. If at any point the ball  drops, you're out of the challenge. Last person left standing wins immunity,  is guaranteed a spot at the final tribal council, where you will get a chance  to convince the jury you're worthy of a million dollars. Also at tonight's  tribal council you will, in effect, be deciding who you want to sit next to  you at that final tribal. A very big decision. This is potentially a  milliondollar challenge. Shall we get to it? All right, everybody pick up  your handles. Five seconds that I count you down, that is your grace period.  Use these five seconds as free time to get your bearings. When we get to one  is when we go. Everybody's picked up their handles, got your first piece in  place. Five, four, three, two, one. This challenge is officially on. We'll go  five minutes before we start adding more pieces, and when we do, it will  become much when we do, it will become much more difficult. more difficult.  The slightest lapse in concentration, and you will be out of this challenge.  You have to constantly check in with yourself and make sure you are staying  focused. All right, this round is over. You can set them down. You are safe.  All right, let's add two more pieces, making this cylinder a little longer, a  little more difficult to hold. Everybody grab your handles. Here we go.  Everybody lift. Five, four, three, two, one. We are on. Everybody now holding  three pieces. Concentrate. All of your energy should be focused on keeping  that ball stable. You drop this ball, it could You drop this ball, it could  cost you a million dollars. cost you a million dollars. One more minute left  in this round. You can do it. Hang in there. Don't blow it now. Last 15  seconds in this round. Five, four, three, two, one. This round is over.  You're safe. Set it down. Nice work. All right, let's add two more pieces.  Now it's going to get interesting. Everybody pick up your handles. Five,  four, three, two, one. This round is on. After 38 days of playing this game  together as a team, nowhere left to hide. Now, instead of working together,  you have to battle against each other with only one against each other with  only one goal-- beat the other two. goal-- beat the other two. Parvati drops  her ball. Parvati is the first person out of this challenge. Parvati's fate  is no longer in her own hands. We are now down to Cirie and Amanda. 15  seconds left in this round. Five, four, three, two, one. This round is over.  Set it down. You are safe.  <br/>Oh, my god.  <br/>Jeff: All right, next round. Let's add two more pieces.  Every time you add pieces, it gets more difficult. Let's put your handles up.  This could be the round that decides it all. Here we go. Five, four, three,  two... Cirie drops. If it falls off while I'm still counting, we reset. Take  your time when you're lifting it up. It's not a race. Here we go, five, four,  three, two, one. Challenge is back on. Amanda going underhand this time.  Cirie sticking with the same grip. Wherever you're holding it, do not move  it. Hold that ball steady if you want a shot at a million bucks. You have  very little wiggle You have very little wiggle room. room. 30 more seconds,  and you move on to the last round. Five, four, three, two, one. This round is  over. You're safe. Set it down. All right. Last and final round. Add the last  two pieces. Pick up your handles. This round will go until somebody drops  their ball. Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one. We are back on. This is  the final round of this This is the final round of this challenge. challenge.  Everything you have inside you should be focused on keeping that ball stable.  The person left standing after this, immunity. Shot at a million bucks. You  lose this challenge, your You lose this challenge, your fate is not in your  hands. fate is not in your hands. Cirie loses her concentration. Amanda wins  final immunity and is guaranteed a spot at the final tribal council.  <br/>Good job, babies. You're awesome.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Good job. You're awesome. You're awesome.  <br/>I love you guys.  <br/>I love you guys.  <br/>Jeff: Amanda, come on over. No better time to have this  than right now.  <br/>Yep.  <br/>Jeff: With this, you are guaranteed a spot at the final  tribal council. You will get a chance to convince the jury you are worthy of  a million bucks. At tonight's tribal council, you will cast a vote, and in  doing so, you will vote either Parvati or Cirie out of the game. The other  person you're going to take with you to the final tribal. Big, big decision.  Have a fun afternoon. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. I will see you  guys at tribal. I will see you guys at tribal.  <br/>Oh, Gloria.  <br/>She likes it here.  <br/>She likes it here. She likes the coop. She likes the  coop.  <br/>Yeah. We just got back from the last immunity challenge,  and I won immunity. So I'm going to the final two. And it's either Parvati or  Cirie going home tonight. Honestly, this is the hardest decision I've had to  make this whole game, because, you know, we're each close. All of us are  close. So who do you send home?  <br/>I don't know what happened. I must have blinked.  <br/>And it just fell?  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>She's a closer, that one, you know?  <br/>I thought for sure that I could win this one. Because  during surgeries, you have to hold, like, retractors or instrumentation, and  you can't really move. If you move, somebody might get hurt. Unfortunately,  Amanda won. And since Parv and Amanda are so buddy-buddy, unless something  happens, I'm probably going home happens, I'm probably going home tonight.  tonight.  <br/>This is my decision, pretty much.  <br/>I know. We're not even voting, I don't think.  <br/>No, I am. Me.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>That sucks.  <br/>I know. I mean, she understands. My fate is pretty much in  Amanda's hands right now. But I'm fairly confident that she's going to take  me to the final two with her. We've had an alliance since day one out here.  And we also have a really tight relationship, Amanda and I, that's developed  over the course of this game. So I'm not worried about it, really. This is  good, because then tomorrow we can just help each other with our opening  speeches, just question each other and hang out. hang out. Oh, today was  awful, though. Oh, today was awful, though.  <br/>Well, you've been handling all these situations really  gracefully, you know.  <br/>Well, I already knew, like, if I didn't win that she'd  take you, so it's not like...  <br/>She pissed way more people off than I did.  <br/>Yeah, actually, huh?  <br/>Yeah, actually, huh?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>This is such a nightmare that this happened today. I can't  even believe that... how do I make the decision? What do I go by?  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>It's, like, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Parvati and Cirie both deserve to be here. They both want  to be here. So I honestly don't know what to do. I have a really good  personal relationship with Parvati, so I feel more loyal to Parvati.  <br/>I feel like your best shot with the jury is taking me over  Parv. Every person she screwed over, I screwed over. We did everything  together. Every blindside we orchestrated together. Most of them I did most  of the talking for. talking for.  <br/>So how is...  <br/>So how is...  <br/>Yeah, but that's only if the people are willing to listen.  These are the people I screwed over I would have to talk to.  <br/>Cirie has pissed a lot of people off on the jury. Probably  more than Parvati. But Cirie is a hell of a speaker. She can convince anyone  to do anything. And in the final tribal council, she could convince the jury  to give her the million dollars. So, I mean, it's kind of a catch-22.  catch-22.  <br/>It should be interesting.  <br/>It should be interesting.  <br/>Making this decision tonight is killing me. You kind of  have to just go with how you feel, and a gut feeling. And I've been going  with my gut this whole game, and it's gotten me this far, but I know that  this decision could cost me the this decision could cost me the million  dollars. million dollars.  <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Eliza,  Ozzy, Jason, James, Alexis, Erik, and Natalie, voted out at the last tribal  council. Well, after 38 days, we've reached a point where there is only one  decision left to be made before we turn this game over to the jury. And that  is, who's going to that final tribal council? Amanda, after winning today's  immunity challenge, you are in total control.  <br/>I know.  <br/>Jeff: Tough decision, in a way. You guys have been  together almost from the beginning.  <br/>Yeah. I mean, winning immunity today was a blessing and a  curse at the same time. You know, it's a blessing because I'm guaranteed the  final two, and it's a curse because I have to choose who goes with me. And  we're so close, it's... It's just a hard, hard decision.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie, do you buy that it's difficult for  Amanda?  <br/>Yeah. I believe it's difficult for Amanda, because we have  been together since day one. Amanda, Parvati, and myself, we kind of decided,  you know, it should be us three 'til the end. And it pretty much has been  that.  <br/>Jeff: Parvati, difficult to not have any say at this  point?  <br/>I honestly don't envy Amanda's position at all right now.  I mean, she has a hard decision to make. We have all been protecting each  other through blindside after blindside, weathering storms together, and I  don't think it is going to be an easy decision, and I wouldn't want to be  making it.  <br/>Jeff: So Amanda, take me through both sides of this. What  about bringing Parvati or Cirie to the end is risky?  <br/>You know, with these girls it's a tossup at this point.  Strategy-wise, Cirie is a great talker. She can convince pretty much anyone  to do anything. And, you know, that's a threat at the end of the game. And  Parvati has played a very social game. She has made personal relationships on  the jury that I think will definitely come into play at the final tribal  council. So it was a hard decision, but I ultimately made a decision on my  gut feeling.  <br/>Jeff: Take me through the mixed emotions that have to be  going through your head-- the joy of knowing "I succeeded, I am going to  be at the final tribal after 39 days of working," and the pain of having  to vote somebody out that you've been with from the beginning.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>That's okay.  <br/>It's just really hard for me, because I feel like either  way, it's a lose-lose situation for me at this point. I mean, if I go with  Cirie, I'm hurts Parvati. If I go with Parvati, I'm hurting Cirie. I know  that this vote tonight is going to hurt someone's feelings. And I'm just  having a hard time with that.  <br/>Jeff: All right, let's get to the vote. Amanda, since you  have immunity, nobody can vote for you. That means Cirie can only vote for  Parvati. Parvati can only vote for Cirie. Parvati and Cirie, you won't vote  tonight. The only person voting tonight is Amanda. You'll be voting out the  15th person from this game, and you will be deciding who you are bringing  with you to the final tribal council. If you're wrong, it is a million-dollar  mistake. If you're right, this time tomorrow night, you're a  millionaire.  <br/>I know.  <br/>Jeff: It's time to vote.  <br/>Jeff: It's time to vote. Amanda, you're up. Amanda, you're  up. Amanda, you're up. I'll go get the vote. I'll go get the vote. Once the  votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to  leave the tribal council area immediately. council area immediately. I'll  read the vote. I'll read the vote. 15th person voted out, and the eighth and  final member of our jury, Cirie. You need to bring me your torch.  <br/>I'm sorry.  <br/>It's okay.  <br/>It's okay. It's all right. It's all right. Cirie, the  tribe has spoken. Cirie, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for  you to go.  <br/>Jeff: Parvati, Amanda, you have gone as far as you can go  in this game. The power now shifts to the jury. Eight people-- including  Cirie-- that you had a hand in voting out now hold your fate in their hands.  You've got one more night. I hope you can enjoy it. I'll see you both  tomorrow night for your final tribal council. Grab your torches, head back to  camp. camp. Good night. Good night.  <br/>Here I am again, coming up just short. HB, John, Jamil,  Jared, Mom, Dad, sorry. I tried my hardest. I tried my hardest. It just  wasn't meant to be. It just wasn't meant to be.  <br/>We're going home tonight.  <br/>I was so happy when I woke up today. To finally know that  I made it to the end, you know, I just kind of, like, breathed and... I can't  believe we did this.  <br/>I can't believe we're the last two.  <br/>I know. Everyone's gone but me and you.  <br/>I know.  <br/>We bamboozled everyone out of the game.  <br/>This morning when I woke up, I think the happiness, like,  started in my stomach, and it bubbled up, and I couldn't wipe the smile off  my face. All the hard work has paid off. We're here, and it's done, and We're  here, and it's done, and we're final two. we're final two.  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>BOTH: Oh... my... God.  <br/>Amanda and I pretty much own this game. She made it all  the way to the end in China. I made it almost all the way to the end in the  Cooks. To be in the final two in this season, it's a serious accomplishment,  and I feel like I can stand up tall and be like, "I am a survivor."  Oh, my god. I am so glad I'm with you.  <br/>I know, me, too! There's no other person here I'd rather  be here with right now.  <br/>Me, either. This is, like, the prettiest picnic  ever.  <br/>This is, like, a huge accomplishment. Like, this is the  biggest accomplishment of my life.  <br/>Mine, too.  <br/>I feel like we battled every element to get where we are  right now-- like, every possible thing that we could go through, we've gone through,  and we've, like, mastered it, and we've gotten ourselves here. In the past  six months, I've been living in the jungle for 78 days, you know, so I don't  think there's much in real life that I can't handle after two Survivorsin a  row.  <br/>We're going to be so good tonight at that tribal  thing.  <br/>Oh, yeah, we're going to be, like, happy and full and be  like, "Yeah, ask us your questions. Bring it on."  <br/>"Bring it on, bitches."  <br/>I think it's interesting that me and Parvati are in the  end of this game together, because we have played completely different games.  I think I have played this game loyal to my alliances, and Parvati pretty  much did anything she needed to do to take control. And because of that, a  lot of people on the jury don't like her, so that could be a benefit for  me.  <br/>We have had this game in the palm of our hands since we  met. And then the switch-up. And then the craziness. And then, still, it's  still you and me. I really, honestly, feel so relaxed going into the final  tribal council. I feel like I've played a game that's been very true to  myself. I don't feel like I could have played this game better.  <br/>You want to do the honors?  <br/>Sure.  <br/>Ah-hah! My game was a lot more aggressive than Amanda's  game. It was a lot more cutthroat, more cold-blooded. I was playing this to  win.  <br/>We're pyromaniacs.  <br/>That's awesome. I think my strongest point I can make  tonight is standing up and owning that I have been a powerful, controlling  player throughout the duration of this throughout the duration of this game.  game.  <br/>Parvati has played a cutthroat, aggressive game, and I  know that she's going to finish with a cutthroat, aggressive game, and that  could be by her throwing me under the bus tonight at tribal. And if that is  the case, then I And if that is the case, then I am ready to fight for this.  am ready to fight for this. I think people will give me their votes, because  I was loyal to every alliance that I've made. Yeah, the jury makes the  decision, but ultimately, it's me and Parvati convincing the jury what to do.  Tonight we're going toe to toe, and one person is going to win a million  dollars, and the other person is going to walk away with nothing, and may the  best with nothing, and may the best woman win. woman win.  <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Eliza,  Ozzy, Jason, James, Alexis, Erik, Natalie, and Cirie, voted out at the last  tribal council. Welcome to your final tribal council. Congratulations on  outlasting 18 other people in this game. Tonight, the power shifts from this  side of the tribal council over to the jury. Based on what they've seen over  the last 39 days and what they hear tonight, the jury will make a  million-dollar decision. Here's how it's going to work. You will each get a  chance to make an opening statement. This is your first chance to convince  this jury why you are deserving of the title of sole survivor. The jury will  then get their first chance to address you. We will then vote. Opening  statements. Opening statements. Amanda, you're up. Amanda, you're up.  <br/>I came into this game, you know, wanting to do two things.  I wanted to play a loyal game, and I wanted to fight physically,  strategically, and mentally to the end. And, you know, I'm really proud of  how I played. And I know I wouldn't be sitting here without, you know, help  from all of you. So thanks. I wanted to say thanks.  <br/>Jeff: Parvati.  <br/>I came into this game with a previous reputation from the  Cook Islands as the flirt. I knew that I had to play so much differently than  I played in the Cook Islands. Like, I had to play aggressively. I had to beat  my competition before my competition had a chance to beat me. And you gave me  a serious run for my money, all of you. So the only thing I could do was make  bold power plays, and with the help of a powerful group of women, pull off  some of the hugest heists in Survivor history. So ask me anything you want,  and you'll get an honest answer.  <br/>Jeff: All right, jury, in a moment you're going to get  your first chance to address Amanda and Parvati. I'll give you a moment to  think I'll give you a moment to think about what you want to say. about what  you want to say.  <br/>Jeff: All right, jury, it is now your first opportunity to  address Amanda and Parvati, trying to gain the information you need to make a  milliondollar decision. dollar decision. Eliza, get us started. Eliza, get us  started.  <br/>Both of you played a great strategic game. You made moves,  and I can respect that. But I honestly have no idea who I'm going to vote for  tonight. Parvati, all 24 days I spent in this game I spent on the island with  you. I think taking out Ozzy was a brilliant strategic move. I respect that  move that you made. What I can't respect, however, is everything you did that  was not necessary for strategic advancement in this game. You talked about me  behind my back. You made fun of me. And that is not what got you to the final  two. It leads me to believe that you might just be a mean person. So I'm  going to have a lot of difficulty giving you my vote tonight. Amanda, you  played a great strategic game, and it was very impressive. However, listening  to you talk literally made me want to kill myself sometimes. I don't know  that I can vote for someone who I think is so superficial. And I'm going to  be sitting right there tonight listening to every single thing you both say,  because my vote is absolutely not determined. So I hope that I can see some  genuineness and honesty from you two tonight.  <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Eliza.  <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Eliza. Jason, you're up. Jason, you're  up.  <br/>Amanda, when Ozzy was voted out, if you were let in on  that plan, would you have told Ozzy?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>And Parv, I've had these misconceptions of you as a  devious, manipulative player. And I just want to know what some of your  redeeming qualities have been in the game.  <br/>Okay. Well, I think for one, I was very protective of my  alliance with Cirie and Amanda, gave them my loyalty, and was loyal to them  all the way to the end. So protectiveness and loyalty to the ladies that I  gave my loyalty to. We didn't kill Gloria the chicken. We saved her life. So  I'm an animal lover. Is that good enough?  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Jeff: Satisfied?  <br/>Yeah. Good luck to the both of you.  <br/>Jeff: Alexis, you're up.  <br/>My first question is for Parv. And, obviously, one of the  biggest, most important things to me is how passionate I am about working  with young girls. I guess I'm just really curious what makes you a better  role model than Amanda for young girls.  <br/>I don't know if it's better or worse. I'm more outspoken  than Amanda. So I think I'm more independent. I don't like things to be done  for me. Amanda would go along with the flow, and for me, I think I'm more  willing to put myself out there and make bold moves. And I didn't see much of  that from Amanda. So I guess that's why I feel like I would make a better  role model.  <br/>Thank you. Amanda, I have seen a bunch of Oscar  award-winning performances and we couldn't help but be laughing when you were  crying about sending Cirie home. It's not that I'm not sympathetic to it. It's  just I think, you know, you cry wolf so many times that, like, what about, if  any, part of your game has been genuine?  <br/>I haven't been faking anything that I've done at tribal.  The tears... like, I've only cried the last tribal council, and that was  genuine. Like, that was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. I didn't  come here trying to get sympathy votes. I don't want sympathy votes.  <br/>Jeff: Do you have what you need?  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>Jeff: Okay.  <br/>Jeff: Okay. Natalie, you're up. Natalie, you're up.  <br/>Ladies. First of all, you have my respect tonight, woman  to woman. I'll start with you, Parv. You have labeled yourself as a flirt.  You're probably the most masterful person in the history of Survivorto play  the flirt card, which is great. My question to you is how does that resonate  for you in the bedroom? How do you take that to the next level as far as  strategy in the game? How does that translate your layers of being?  <br/>Jeff: Come on, guys. Parvati, do you know what she's  asking?  <br/>You're a flirt. You flirted with me on several occasions.  I'm not complaining.  <br/>You're sexy.  <br/>Thanks. So how does being the flirt parallel to your  intimate life?  <br/>I think my strategy in this game has been infused with my  personality, and being flirtatious is a big part of my personality. At home,  it gets me what I want. I'll flirt with girls to get my way, or I'll flirt with  guys to get my way. And I think I honestly can develop genuine relationships  with people without flirting with them. But it is an old standby, I'm not  going to lie.  <br/>Okay. Amanda, clearly, you're a beautiful woman. You  appear to be a very strong woman. Unfortunately, you always had, like, a  glazed-over look on your face. I did notice that. My question to you is was  that your strategy to kind of play the zombied pretty girl, not really  knowing what's going on, pageant queen cliche, or is this who you are as a  person?  <br/>No, it's neither. It was neither my strategy, nor do I  think that's who I am as a person. I'm a strong woman. I definitely have  substance. Sometimes I'm a little reserved, but I definitely think I've made  intellectual strategic decisions. And, you know, I want to compete with the  men. Like, I came in this game to compete with the guys. And I don't want  anything given to me. I came in here to earn everything.  <br/>Okay, thank you both for your answers.  <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Natalie.  <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Natalie. Erik, you're up. Erik, you're  up.  <br/>Hi, girls. Let me just start by saying five to six days  ago, I would have been 100% voting for Amanda in this situation. I mean, I  really respected you, Amanda. And I really thought of you kind of as a big  sister, or a cousin. As of late, after seeing certain things, I mean, I'm  looking at you right now with a lot of questions. I felt totally burned,  totally thrown under the bus at the past two tribal councils that I was  there. You pretty much ripped me apart. I mean, on what basis did you have to  just judge me in front of everybody, in front of this jury?  <br/>Okay.  <br/>I just want to know that. I really want to know  that.  <br/>You know, everything I said in tribal council was honest.  You were unloyal to me, and you tried to get me voted out, and I was hurt. I  wasn't going to sit there and let you try to vote me out and just keep my  mouth shut. I'm sorry, if I hurt your feelings, but...  <br/>Too late for "I'm sorries." I've heard you say  that... you said that directly to me at one of the tribal councils. Too  little, too late. You said that directly to me. And now you're going to say  "I'm sorry" to me. I really don't buy that at all.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>I think I'm good.  <br/>Jeff: Okay. James. How's the finger?  <br/>The finger's all right. It's good. I mean, I'm not even  going to be difficult. Amanda pretty much knows she's got it in the bag. The  only thing is, Parvati, you fluffed me. You did the great move with Ozzy, and  the next day you came up to me with a bunch of fluff. So we're just going to  pretend like you didn't say that, have a go again, we reenact it, you give me  a different version. Go on, give it to me, and make it believable.  <br/>Ha, ha, got you, sucker. What?  <br/>That's not it. Try a little bit harder.  <br/>That is what you wanted me to say.  <br/>No, that's not what I wanted.  <br/>That's exactly what you said you wanted me to say.  <br/>You're over-exaggerating it. What I wanted, you to just be  honest. "Hey, I'm playing the game. It's a game." I mean, when I  play the game...  <br/>It is a game. And the game... the motto is "Outplay,  outwit, outlast."  <br/>Exactly.  <br/>There was no chance for me to win this game if I stuck  with you, and if I stuck with Oz. There was no chance of me sitting here if I  stuck with you guys. And that's what I felt. I felt like I had to make that  move when I made it. It also, you know, gave me a lot of control. And that's  what I wanted.  <br/>Are you finished?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>All right.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie, you're up.  <br/>All righty. Congratulations to both of you. I'm going to  start with you, Amanda. Being that you had the decision to make, tell me and  the jury why Parvati deserves a million dollars more than I do.  <br/>Parvati played a very aggressive, bold game. I think she's  stood by her game the whole time, and I respect that about her.  <br/>So in saying that, are you saying you don't respect my  game?  <br/>No, I respect your game as well. I think Parvati made  bolder decisions in this game.  <br/>Than I did?  <br/>Yes. And I think she was kind of the powerhouse in making  those decisions happen.  <br/>Okay. Parvati, I would like you to tell the jury why I  should be sitting in your seat, and you be over here on the jury.  <br/>I think you played a pretty brilliant game. Yours was a  little more, you know, under the radar than mine was, which I think is a  great strategy, you know, to get up here, too. But I can't compete with a  mother of three. You have kids. You have a family. I don't have that. So  based on those two factors, I would say it should have been you right here.  Is that good? Is that good enough? No?  <br/>I'll ponder over here.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Thanks, ladies. Good luck.  <br/>Thanks.  <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Cirie.  <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Cirie. Ozzy, you're up. Ozzy, you're  up.  <br/>I think I might be the biggest idiot up here. I am truly  to the bottom of my heart hurt by what you did to me. It was a great move. It  really was. But I never in a million years thought that you could do that to  me. You put a price on our friendship. You threw us away like garbage. You  basically said, "You know what? You're not quite worth this much  money." And it hurts, you know? It really does hurt. And how can you say  that you're a role model when you're willing to discard a valuable friendship  like that? A human being. But I don't want words. No words at all. I don't  want to talk to you. Honestly, the hardest part for me was the fact that you  took away 14 days that I could have away 14 days that I could have spent with  Amanda. spent with Amanda. Amanda, when I told you on the beach at one point  when you asked me if I was playing you or not, I told you honestly that I'm  not faking it. I'm not faking my feelings for you or anything, no. I really  am having feelings that I've never really felt before and have never... I  honestly feel like I started to fall in love with you. And... I don't know.  You're just an amazing girl. And I really want everybody to know that. And  I'm glad I didn't win Cook Islandso that I could be here and have met  you.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>And that's it.  <br/>Jeff: All right, jury. You've now had your opportunity to  address Amanda and Parvati. Certainly, an interesting final tribal council,  very emotional at times. Now you have to make a million-dollar decision. Who  do you vote for to win this game? I'm going to give you a moment I'm going to  give you a moment to think about your vote. to think about your vote.  <br/>Jeff: All right, jury, Amanda and Parvati have had their  chance to address you. You've had your chance to address them. Now we get to  the vote. Tonight you are voting for a winner-- the name of the person you  feel most deserving of the title of sole survivor, and the million-dollar  check that goes with it. For the last time, it is time to vote. vote. Cirie,  you're up. Cirie, you're up.  <br/>I'm willing to forgive and forget if you're willing to  forgive and forget. forgive and forget.

And  I know you're going to do And I know you're going to do amazing things with  this money. amazing things with this money.  <br/>I hope to god that you win. You deserve it a million times  more than Parvati. more than Parvati. And... love you. And... love you.  And... love you.  <br/>Oh, my god.  <br/>Oh, my god.  <br/>Oh, my god.  <br/>Jeff: I'll go get the votes.  <br/>Jeff: I'll go get the votes.
