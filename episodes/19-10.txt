<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: After the merge...  We're now one tribe! <br/>Probst: The old Galu tribe was up eight to four. <br/>Right now, the Galu tribe is tight. We confirmed, that you know what? Let's stick together. <br/>Probst: And they anticipated that the rest of the old Foa Foa would go out  quickly and easily. <br/>What you need to know you know. <br/>Probst: But the Foa Foa four resolved not to go out gently. <br/>We all hoped to put a big dent in that arrogance and patronizing attitude  they have towards us. <br/>Probst: First they convinced the old Galu to vote out one of their own. <br/>I don't trust Erik. <br/>Probst: When Erik left, Galu's numbers dropped down to seven. The tribe has spoken. At the next Tribal Council, the old Galu was set to take out Russell. But he shocked them by playing the hidden immunity idol. <br/>Keep hope alive. <br/>Probst: So Kelly went home, leaving Galu with only six members. Or so it would seem. But the old Galu doesn't know that one of their own, Shambo, is conspiring  with Russell to get rid of Laura. <br/>Shambo hates Laura. She hates her. <br/>Laura needs to go. She's the bane of my existence. <br/>Probst: Well, since the merge, there have been two Tribal Councils, two blind  sides, two hidden immunity idols played, and once again, the Foa Foa foursome  have survived the vote. One more thing, the hidden immunity idol goes back into the game. <br/>My work is done. It's like a painting, like a Picasso, you know? He's a great artist. This is my artwork. This might be one of my best pieces of work I've ever done. There's going to be a pretty expensive sale. They'll write me a check for $1 million for this work, so I can take that...  Take that to the bank. <br/>If you guys tell Galu I said this-- "good move!"  Let me tell you something, that was almost as great as my kids being born. (laughter)  Dude. <br/>Wow. <br/>Yeah, wow. <br/>I cannot believe that little snake...  Part of the game. <br/>Yep. <br/>Yes, it is. <br/>We've still got the numbers. <br/>It was quite the shock at Tribal Council tonight when Russell pulled out that  second hidden immunity idol. We know that he's sneaky and that he just, like, lurks around camp and he's  always snooping around. We should have known better. We really should have known better. <br/>Oh, you're in trouble. <br/>(laughing)  Oh, my God, the look on her face when you played that immunity idol. Do you know what she said when they said, "Kelly, bring me your  torch." She goes, "He has ruined everything." And it was all I  could do to keep a straight face. <br/>I ruined everything? What does she think I'm here for her, for to bake her cookies and cakes? (laughter)  Nobody out of the 11 people had a clue what the hell was going on with the  exception of me and Russ, and when he got up and played that immunity idol,  the look on Laura's face-- she was just pissed. It was awesome. And I was thinking I got to find that immunity idol, give it to Russ again. *  It's a new beginning. Jeff said the immunity idol is back in the game, and I'll be here looking for  it, and I will find it. It will be the third one. It's like, they're like magnets to me. I'm just drawn to them. <br/>Okay. Work. <br/>Laura is the head viper. She is the viper queen of Galu. She is the snake of the tribe. She is the evil demon. She's a beast. Laura has been the first one to go in my mind since day one. <br/>I want to relax a bit this morning. I want to swing by the wall, Sham, and just...  Yeah. I got four Foa Foa. I got me. We're on an even playing field right now. I have to have John. He's my number six. Hold on a second. Come here. <br/>What's up? <br/>Here's the thing-- you know, it's all well and fine that everybody wants to  espouse purple power. There is no purple. It takes balls to jump into this arena. And how far do you want to extend your life? The next immunity challenge, just like the last two, Laura's won, and both  times, Laura was supposed to go for the majority of the tribe. So I want to know that if she doesn't win it, will you be the sixth vote to  put her out? <br/>I don't have an answer to that question right now. I don't. I believe I am the only one from Galu that knows that Shambo has flipped. Now the question is what are you going to do with it? <br/>Will you betray my confidence that I asked you that question? <br/>I won't-- I won't-- I will look you straight in the eyes and I will not tell  anyone that you asked me that question. Things are on the table with Shambo. She thinks she's in good with me, and she is. <br/>Okay. Thanks, Johnny. <br/>But, you know what? I've got do what's right for me. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: All right, for today's challenge, you will divide into two teams of  five. One person from each team will lie facedown in a cradle suspended in the air. Attached to that cradle are four ropes. The other four people will pull on the ropes to maneuver the person in the  cradle as they gather 15 flags one at a time in order and place them in their  appropriate spot. First team to get all 15 wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: The winning team will board a plane and fly to the neighboring island  of Savai'i. You'll land at a beautiful waterfall and have a nice picnic lunch. <br/>During the reward, I'm thinking that they're going to be giving out a clue  for the next hidden immunity idol. Man, if I can find this clue, that-that's it. It's over. <br/>Probst: In addition, you will take with you the Palm Pre by Sprint. Now, you'll have something that fits in the palm of your hand, is easy to  use, and will allow you to take some great photographs, make some fun  memories of a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: All right. We'll draw for teams and get started. All right, we have our two teams. Yellow-- Shambo, Jaison, Monica, and Mick with John in the cradle. For purple, we have Dave Ball, Brett, Laura and Russell, with Natalie in the  cradle. For reward. Survivors ready? Go. You have to use the four ropes to maneuver your person to get their flags. Natalie has the first flag for purple. She's got to get it in the slot. John has the first flag for yellow. John drops the flag. There's a learning curve. <br/>You got it, you got it, stick it in. <br/>Probst: Natalie has the first flag for purple. <br/>Take your time. Hold on, watch the ropes. <br/>Probst: Yellow can't get the gri-- There it is. John has the flag again. <br/>Turn me, turn me, turn me. <br/>Probst: Natalie has the second flag for purple. <br/>You guys, sit on your butts. <br/>Got it. <br/>Good job! <br/>Probst: John gets the first flag. Purple doing very well. <br/>That's a girl. <br/>Probst: John has the second flag for yellow. Natalie has the third flag for purple. <br/>Sit on your butts! Sit on your butts. <br/>Probst: Jaison, Shambo, Mick and Monica now getting it together. <br/>That's a girl. Force to the right. <br/>Probst: Purple with their third flag. Yellow with two flags. <br/>Little closer. <br/>Probst: Natalie reaching for number four, she has it. <br/>Got it, go, come on! <br/>Probst: Purple has their fourth flag. Yellow has their third flag. Natalie with the fifth flag for purple. Yellow hanging-- nope, nope, nope. Yellow knocked out number 9. You got to get it back in its slot now. <br/>That's a girl. You're doing great. You're there. <br/>Probst: That is really going to cost them some time. <br/>Come on, get it down! <br/>Probst: You almost got it. John has it. He's got to get it back in its slot now before he can go on. You're good. Purple has their seventh flag. <br/>Go, keep your ropes up. Keep your ropes up. Come on! Let's go! John quickly gets the fifth flag for yellow. <br/>That's a girl! <br/>There you go. Let's go, let's go! <br/>Probst: Natalie now with the eighth flag for purple. John has the sixth flag for yellow. <br/>Stay in there! <br/>Probst: Natalie hanging on with her legs. You got this, girl. <br/>Good job! <br/>Grab it! <br/>Probst: John has seven. They're still in it. <br/>Good job, Nat! <br/>Probst: Natalie has the ninth flag for purple. <br/>That's the stuff! <br/>Probst: Yellow have seven. <br/>Come on. <br/>Eight's over here! <br/>Down. <br/>Probst: Natalie hanging out of that cradle. <br/>Get closer, pull down. <br/>Probst: Using all of her body. She's got the tenth flag. <br/>Right there, right there. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Go! <br/>Probst: Yellow trying to make up some time. <br/>Right there! <br/>Probst: Natalie has the tenth flag for purple. Five flags left. Natalie has the 11th flag. Yellow has their eighth flag. Natalie with the 12th flag for purple looking for 13. <br/>You got this, girl! <br/>Take me home! <br/>I got you, John, go! <br/>Probst: John places number nine. Natalie has 14. Purple has one flag left. <br/>Hang on, baby! Hang on, baby! <br/>Hold on, Natalie! <br/>Probst: Natalie, don't fall out. <br/>Go, go, go, go! <br/>Hang on, Natalie. Last one. <br/>We got this, we got this! Yeah! <br/>Probst: That's it! Purple has the 15th and final flag. Got to get it in the slot. <br/>Keep your ropes up. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Slowly, don't let her fall. <br/>Probst: For a nice reward. <br/>Come on! You know what it's for! <br/>Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! <br/>Probst: Purple wins reward! Russell, Brett, Dave Ball, Laura and Natalie going on reward. <br/>Good girl. Come on. <br/>Come on, Nat. <br/>You were awesome! <br/>That was great! <br/>Probst: Purple, congratulations. You're gonna enjoy a wonderful afternoon. In addition, Palm Pre by Sprint. Make some memories. Take some photos. Enjoy it. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: John, Monica, Jaison, Shambo, Mick, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>If I can find this clue for the next hidden immunity idol, then I can't see  how it's not gonna be possible for me to do what I want to do and take out  Laura. <br/>We won a reward today: Natalie, me, Laura, Brett, and Dave. Now, we get to fly to another island, eat and take pictures with a Sprint  phone, which is wonderful. I need to eat, bad. <br/>It's like a little Gilligan's island or something, huh? <br/>Oh, my word, it's so cool. <br/>I think that's the island we're going to. <br/>Really? <br/>Who's gonna eat? <br/>Uh! <br/>I'm gonna eat. <br/>Oh, my gosh! It's hot dogs! That I love! Oh! <br/>Give me a plate. <br/>I want some of that good old pie. <br/>I've had dreams about you, baby. <br/>Oh, my goodness, finally, day 26, I get to go on a reward and I needed the  food. I literally was, like, wasting away. <br/>Oh, my God! Try that pie. <br/>It felt just like home. It was really, really nice. I just felt really thankful to have gotten to go. <br/>Thank you for allowing me and Russell to come on our first reward. <br/>Congratulations. <br/>I'm glad you guys could take part. <br/>You guys. One, two, three. <br/>Seems like you guys are pretty tight. I know we're tight. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I know where the votes are right now. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>And... you know, if we, if we essentially feel like if we get one more on our  side, we're willing to offer them a very, very good deal. <br/>I don't know. Just don't know. You know what I mean? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's risky. <br/>We just need to make a decision, go to challenge, and go to Tribal Council. <br/>But, I mean, we need another-- we need one more vote. <br/>No, we don't. <br/>No, we don't. <br/>Yeah, we do. <br/>You're number six. <br/>It's still gonna be 5-5. <br/>We have five besides you. <br/>Five besides you. <br/>You are number six. <br/>You're six. <br/>Which is why we asked. We need six. <br/>How sure are you? <br/>115%. <br/>How do you know they're not just saying it to you? <br/>We know. 'Cause let's put it this way-- this person knew about the last Tribal Council. <br/>Right. And he or she actually encouraged things to make that whole thing happen. <br/>I'm thinking that one of the other people that they're talking about is  Shambo. Shambo could be the fifth vote for the Foa Foas. You can't tell me who that is? <br/>No, we won't. <br/>I want John out. <br/>We can absolutely do that. <br/>Great. <br/>What a great day, guys. <br/>This is phenomenal. Best reward so far, Dave? <br/>Best reward so far. <br/>Looking through the photos, I seen a note that's telling us "Go to your  memo board," and you'll get the clue. First thing that pops in my head-- hidden immunity idol. That would be my third one. <br/>"This Palm in your hand "holds much information which "you  better heed or it will be "your own loss. "The immunity idol is no "rolling stone. "A rolling stone gathers no moss."  A rolling stone gathers what? <br/>"No moss."  I'm gonna look all over the place. I'll find it, for sure. I'll find it. <br/>"Go to videos to watch an "additional clue to the hidden immunity  idol." Okay, I'll watch it and then pass it on. "Additional hint."  The immunity idol is under a stinking rock. <br/>Eight seconds. That's it. <br/>I ain't got to see it again. As soon as I go back to camp, I'm gonna start looking for it 'cause I need  the immunity idol for myself. <br/>Shambo! <br/>Hi, you guys! Hello! I missed you! It's about that big. It's not a round rock. It's square. It has moss on it. <br/>Can you show us there? <br/>They're moving. <br/>No. <br/>Those guys are already moving. <br/>We totally underestimated Russell's capability of finding the idol. What we need to do is keep that hidden immunity idol out of Russell's hands. <br/>It's time to hunt. <br/>I guess so. <br/>The party's on. <br/>There you go. <br/>You finding for the same thing I'm looking for, Jaison? <br/>I don't know. What are you looking for? <br/>You're the one that's lifting up rocks. <br/>Here's a green. <br/>No, it's too new. I know that it has to be where that wall is in camp. They have a rock in a little hole, square hole. Looks like the rock in the picture to me. Dave's following me around, turning over rocks. I get nervous at first 'cause I think I see the rock and then he turns it  over and nothing's there. So I'm figuring if all of this... You think you can run with me? <br/>We're just gonna put y'all... Oh, man! <br/>Slow down, Russ! <br/>All right. Come on, Dave. <br/>Slow down, man, slow down! All right. Come on, Dave. <br/>I came back to the same location. I'm looking at the wall. Look down there. There it is. Oh, my God. Oh, man. This is getting way too easy. I'm enjoying it. I'm just running around. I'm having more fun now than I've ever had, and my butt's probably in the  sling more than ever, but not if they think I have an idol. I'm gonna be a-okay. * I mean... I don't trust Shambo or John. And Shambo hates you. And she's pissed, Laura. We have to be careful. They might come after you. <br/>They'll come after me first. I think the Foa Foa people are coming after me. I've had a target on my head from them from day one. Sham just completely despises me. I need to be on the top of my game, and I have to win this challenge. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: First things first, Laura, give it up. Once again, immunity back up for grabs. Today's challenge happens in two parts: first part, you'll have three tiles  of the same color arranged close together. Your goal? Throw one rock and attempt to break as many of these tiles as you can. For every tile you break, you earn a spear, which you will use in the second  part of the challenge when you will shoot your spears at a target. Person who lands their spear closest to the target wins immunity, guaranteed  a one-in[1]nine  shot at a million dollars. Losers, Tribal Council. Somebody will be voted out. Make sense? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. Makes sense. <br/>Probst: We draw for spots. We'll get started. All right, everybody grab one rock. If you want a shot at immunity, you've got to break a tile. These tiles are arranged close together. That means you could break multiple tiles. It also means somebody could break one of yours. But you've only got one throw. Here we go. Ready? Aim... and throw. <br/>Son of a gun! <br/>Probst: Shambo just misses. Russell goes low. Jaison's on the board with one spear. <br/>Damn. <br/>Probst: Fincher just misses. Monica can't get it there. <br/>Damn it! <br/>Probst: Dave Ball knocks out one of Monica's tiles. Monica now has a spear. <br/>Enjoy, money. <br/>Thanks, honey. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Natalie a little short. <br/>Nice. <br/>Oh, bummer! <br/>Probst: Mick connects with one of his tiles. <br/>Brett breaks two tiles with one toss. <br/>Probst: Laura, the only person left to throw. You want a shot at immunity, this is it. You have to break a tile. That's it. <br/>(laughing)  Probst: No shot at immunity for Laura, Russell, Shambo, John, Natalie, and  Dave Ball. All right, moving on to the second part of the challenge. Brett has two spears. Jaison, Mick, and Monica have one. Let's go. Brett, you're up. <br/>Sounds good. <br/>Go, Brett. <br/>Go, B. <br/>Probst: Brett taking aim of his first shot. <br/>Come on, baby. (applause)  Good job, Brett! <br/>Probst: Brett is on the board. <br/>Good job, Brett! <br/>Probst: Brett has the mark to beat. Jaison, you're up. To have a shot at immunity, Jaison has to get inside the mark set by Brett,  currently in that second ring. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Jaison misses the target completely. Jaison, no shot at immunity. Monica. Monica here thanks to Dave Ball who broke one of Monica's tiles. Monica fires. Hits the target but too low. Monica, no shot at immunity. <br/>Good shot. <br/>Good job. <br/>Good try, Monica. <br/>Probst: Mick. One spear. That's all it takes, one shot could win it. Mick with a great shot. Puts his spear inside of Brett's. Mick is the new mark to beat. It comes down to this. Brett, one spear left. You know what you have to do. Take your shot. <br/>Take your time, babe. <br/>Probst: Brett hits too low. Mick wins individual immunity. (applause)  Good job, Mick. <br/>Probst: Mick, come on over. Congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Mick safe at tonight's Tribal Council. For one of you, that will be as far as it goes. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you tonight at Tribal Council. Congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I believe it is the destiny of Laura to go home. Today is the day of reckoning. Medusa's head will be lopped off. <br/>Does anybody want any of this coconut? <br/>Are you going to open that thing up? <br/>I'm going to give it a sh...  Isn't that the cotton candy ones? <br/>You got a feeling? <br/>I got a feeling. <br/>The plan is and always was for the last nine days is get rid of Laura. She keeps winning immunity. She finally loses, we got to get rid of her. I was happy about that. Because I knew at least, okay, at least, we have a tie. And now, we have a fighting chance because it's five to five because Shambo  is voting Laura. There's no if, ands, and buts about that. She's voting Laura. <br/>I'm voting for Laura tonight, and I don't care who else is doing what. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I really don't. But...  You're not going to fluctuate or change at all? <br/>There's no way in God's green Earth. Had she not won immunity the last two times, that's whose name I would have  written down. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>She's too strong and she's too manipulative. <br/>Okay. <br/>There is no more Galu. <br/>Okay. <br/>What's up? <br/>We were going to ask, because we were talking about some stuff, and I said we  need to go talk to John. Because he's the number cruncher. <br/>What's up? <br/>Keep it simple, just get rid of the Foa Foa. Wait until the very last minute so they don't know who it is. We vote Russell. If he has the idol, he plays it, it flushes out--  Incorrect. <br/>Okay. <br/>The answer is Natalie. <br/>Okay. <br/>And the reason is she's the least likely to have the idol because she didn't  look for it. The vote is Natalie, times five. <br/>Perfect. <br/>Find a problem with that. Is that wrong? <br/>Five guys? Okay, okay. <br/>I know you'd rather not have Natalie. No, no, no, I like that. <br/>I'll burn her right now, I do not care, bro. <br/>It's continually impressive and bordering on annoying how pathetic the  analytical skills of the Galu tribe are. "Let's telegraph a move to Russell." You're an idiot. "Let's sit back and let's piss off Shambo." You're an idiot. "Let's sit back and vote off Erik over a 30-second decision."  You're an idiot. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Laura's going home. <br/>No, no. <br/>Yes, because Shambo will vote for Laura. <br/>I know, but it's a 5-5 tie. 5-5 tie. It may be true--  Right. <br/>But you're saying it as if it is a certainty, game over. That is not the case. <br/>They're on the fence. Some people are saying John. <br/>That's great. <br/>So if we say John, so keep it with John? <br/>So that means, like, we need to go talk to Mick or something. <br/>Oh, that's brilliant. I'll say John, and then they think they have two Galu saying John. <br/>Let's just think about it. <br/>But it's an option. It's a good option. <br/>It is a good option. Just don't get excited. John is flighty. So we don't want to do anything premature. We want to give it some more thought. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Because he gets nervous. <br/>That's fine. <br/>All right, cool. <br/>This is a big move, you guys. <br/>We'll make it happen. It'll be beautiful. <br/>Just be confident. <br/>Yeah, be confident. Confident. <br/>Laura's my strongest ally here, and I do not want to throw her under the bus,  so the plan is for me to tell Foa Foa that I am voting for John. In reality, I would be voting Natalie with my tribe. So hopefully all goes to plan and it'll be four Foa Foa members voting John,  five Galu members voting Natalie, and then the one, Shambo, voting Laura. Listen I think if we get rid of John now. <br/>Look I want to--  Listen, listen, if we do it now, we still have Shambo against Laura and then  we have even more numbers. <br/>Look, look, look, look, Shambo is not doing no other vote but Laura tonight. It's going to end up by being a tie you don't go Laura. And I was with that from the beginning. <br/>I'm not ready to write Laura's name. If I'm switching, this is a huge move for me, Russell. If I'm switching, I'm not going to vote out, like... I'm going to vote out  someone I want to vote out. Do you see that? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>John's smart. <br/>Yeah, I know. I want to get rid of John. We need to get him out now. This is a huge move for me. And the thing is, is that I would rather take out John than Laura. <br/>Okay, all right. <br/>Just because, I mean, in the end, I need to have some sort of security  blanket, and I don't trust John. Do you see what I'm saying? <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>I don't know how much Foa Foa can trust Monica. She seems legit, or Laura has put, you know, a little snake in the grass to  get information, which is almost as likely. <br/>She makes me a little nervous, but I like to think she's on our side. <br/>You know what? I want to get the okay from y'all, but I think the only way this is going to  work is to let John know. <br/>Let John know what? <br/>Let him know that they're after him. That's the only way this is going to work, dude. <br/>He doesn't trust us. <br/>It's going to be a tie. It's going to be a tie. <br/>What's the plan? Where's Shambo at today? <br/>What's the response? <br/>It's like, trying to get them to vote for you, Shambo's voting for Laura,  four would vote for you. And none of us would go for another one. <br/>Yeah, well, I haven't said anything. Shambo-- honestly, Shambo's going to vote for Laura no matter what. We've got to think of another option to deter their votes. <br/>Well, I can come up with something, but the answer is to not get four votes  against me. The most recent development today is that the new best way to save Laura is  to throw four Foa Foa votes behind John. Uh, no. It doesn't sound like a good plan when you're John. <br/>We're just thinking through ideas, how can we shake up the Foas? <br/>All right, you guys are betting my life that Shambo votes for Laura. We are betting nothing. <br/>I would. <br/>Well, let's bet yours and not mine, then. Because I wouldn't. <br/>Everyone's got your back. <br/>I'm not risking my life to save Laura's. Sorry, Laura, not in the cards. Laura picked a fight with somebody that I think is about to knock her out. And I'm not going to step in the way of the punch. <br/>I was born at night but not last night. Right? <br/>What have you heard? <br/>I believe that we're trying to be swindled into telling us to put your name  down, everybody is. I don't believe that. We're putting Laura's name down, and we're going to go to the tie. <br/>If there is a tie tonight, the rules of Survivor state there is a re-vote. If there is a tie again, the remaining members now choose rocks. One of these rocks will be of different color, and that person will go home. <br/>If it goes to the tie, that's when it has to happen, the switch. <br/>If I vote for Laura tonight, after the tie, I wake up on this beach tomorrow. <br/>I done talked to everybody. Everybody's on the same page. We said whoever does the switch, that's who we know is on board. If they don't do the switch, we pick a rock. <br/>And-and what's the next vote? <br/>The next vote? <br/>If I'm going to give you Galu before you give me a Foa Foa, the next one  needs to be Foa Foa. <br/>Okay. <br/>Deal? <br/>That's a deal. <br/>But Russell is a player. This guy is full of B.S. And it's clear the guy will do anything to progress in this game. My first instinct is the best situation that I can position myself in would  be to vote with Galu, have a 5-5 tie, vote with Galu again, have another 5-5  tie, and just pray to God that one of the Foa Foa members go. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do yet. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Erik and Kelly voted out at the last Tribal Council. John, are you surprised, two Tribal Councils, two Galu sitting over there? <br/>Absolutely. Both of the two votes so far were surprises to me. It's all a surprise. <br/>Probst: Jaison, is it easier in some sense at this point to be the minority  because with four, you don't have as many many options? You have to stick together. <br/>Sure, you could make that argument. And because we're the minority, if people want to use the votes, they can  depend on our trustworthiness to go further. <br/>Probst: John, what is appealing about the Foa Foa foursome? <br/>They've already said it. You can use four votes. It's plain and simple. <br/>Yeah, we've said it, but we still trying to find somebody. <br/>We're trying to figure out, like, at what point somebody says, "Oh, hey. This is an individual game," and take advantage of our votes, and start  playing their own game. <br/>Probst: Shambo, is Galu one tight unit still? <br/>Negative. Absolutely not. The day that everybody decided to vote Erik off, Galu was broken to me. That's my humble opinion. <br/>Probst: Laura, you're still staring at Shambo. <br/>I don't know who she's talking about because the Galu that I know, that I've  been in, I feel is tight. <br/>Probst: A group can't be tight if one of the members isn't. <br/>I guess it depends on how big of a group you're considering. <br/>Probst: Well, here's what I would consider. If Shambo's on the fence, their four becomes five, your six becomes five-- we  got a really interesting night in store. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Probst: Are you okay with it potentially coming down to a tie knowing that,  if we revote and you're still tied, everybody over here will draw rocks, and  the people who are tied will be safe? <br/>I'm absolutely not okay with taking a chance. But I'm not the only one in control of this game. I have these other people sitting next to me that have decisions to make as  well. <br/>Probst: Dave, are you okay with this going to a tie? <br/>If I need to go to the stones, then I'll go. <br/>Probst: After 27 days, you would draw a stone at chance and you're prepared  to do that? <br/>You got to be willing to make big moves in this game in order to win. I'd say there's nothing bigger than lady luck. <br/>Probst: I always love it when it gets to the vote, but tonight I am  especially curious how it's gonna go. Mick, you have individual immunity. I can't imagine you're giving it up tonight. <br/>Nope. <br/>Probst: Cannot vote for Mick. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. Brett, you're up. <br/>(whispering): Laura, you are a viper, as in poison. I pray to God you go tonight. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Laura. Natalie. One vote Laura, one vote Natalie. Laura. Two votes Laura. Natalie. Two votes Natalie. Laura. That's three votes Laura, twp votes Natalie. Natalie. We're tied, three votes Laura, three votes Natalie. That's four votes Laura, three votes Natalie. Natalie. Four votes Natalie, four votes Laura. Laura. That's five votes Laura, four votes Natalie. One vote left. Natalie. We have a tie. Here's how the tie's gonna work: Laura and Natalie, you will not vote. Everybody else will vote. You can only vote for Laura or Natalie. Brett, you're up first. Come grab the urn. <br/>I'm ready to roll the dice. Let's go. *  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Laura. Natalie. One vote Laura, one vote Natalie. Two votes Laura, one vote Natalie. Tied again. Two votes Laura, two votes Natalie. Laura. That's three votes Laura, two votes Natalie. Natalie. We're tied, three votes Laura, three votes Natalie, two votes left. Laura. That's four votes Laura, three votes Natalie. One vote left. Ninth person voted out and the third member of our jury, Laura. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: Laura, the tribe has spoken. Well, since the merge, there have been three very surprising Tribal Councils. At this point, I don't know if it's Galu, Foa Foa or Aiga. And I'm guessing you guys don't either. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:  It's time for me for me to create chaos. (chicken clucking)  Shambo is the one leading the charge. <br/>Let's just pull the trigger. <br/>I agree. <br/>He's a cancer. We have to dump him now. <br/>Sometimes you just have to say, "Screw it. I'm gonna follow."  So Mick's on aboard with the plan. <br/>Yeah, we're all, we're all with you, Sham. <br/>I believe that I'm sitting here tonight for a couple of reasons: one, because  Shambo has always had it out for me, and, two, I think that I was a physical  threat. Clearly, it wasn't a good idea going into the first two individual immunity  challenges and winning them back to back. I'm disappointed, but I hope that Galu sticks together and someone from the  purple ends up winning the million dollars. So, good luck, guys.
