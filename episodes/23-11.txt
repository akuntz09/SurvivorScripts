<br/>Jeff: Tonight, get ready to take  a closer look at 19 new scenes from one of the most memorable seasons of  "Survivor." this game has brought new meaning to leadership,  humility, winning, and losing. This is the first 27 days of "Survivor: South Pacific." with some  of the most memorable first-time players in "Survivor" history, two  legendary former players return to the game for a shot at redemption. Both were quick to set up their core alliances. I've got a solid alliance with Rick, Sophie, Brandon, Edna, and Albert. My five-person alliance right now is myself, Keith, Whitney, Elyse, and Jim. Jeff: They led two of the most evenly matched tribes ever. Upolu wins immunity! Savaii wins immunity! But Coach struggled to control an unruly ally. I kind of told you guys to vote for Mikayla. You see the lie, how the lie came out. Stop it. I'm telling you. No, I want you to stop it. Jeff: And Cochran was left dodging bullets all along the way. Why? Physically he's going to be a threat to himself. I hate to say it, Cochran, but you lost it for us. Jeff: After the merge, both tribes were six strong. Cheers, everybody. Jeff: And Coach found a chirchg in the armor of the former Savaii. There's a line in the sand. Jeff: And at tribal council, Cochran did cross that line. And Keith was voted out, follow by Ozzy. I will be back. I hope to see all of you coming through redemption, and i'll send you on your  way. Jeff: Ozzy was exiled to Redemption Island. Leaving Coach in full control of the game. I'm out here to win. I'm on the here to go step by step and be the last man standing. Jeff: Tonight, we'll see new scenes. I'm ready to be seduced. Seduce her! Jeff: Uncover-up hidden strategies. Mixing things up this early crazy. Jeff: Reveal previously untold stories. I would screw my tribe over. You have my word that me and you to the end. Jeff: And give new insight into the ongoing adventure of "Survivor."  captioning brought to you by Survivor productions, cbs, jeff: In the early  days of the game, the two tribes took different approaches to camp life. Get everything figured out and work on the shelter. Reporter: Jeff: These differences defined their journey. We'll put one here and one here. Let's do it. Jeff: Through the rest of the game. At stavie-- you guys want to go swimming? Jeff: Ozzy led a care-free tribe with a laid back attitude but Cochran and Dawn  had trouble getting on the party train. Man, that hurts. We're on a tropical island but we are a ton more modest I think the way we  dress day to day. You guys coming or not? Not having the swim see the suitis a little bit of a dilemma for me because I’m  not used to swimming with people I just met. In the nude. In my underwear. I have six kids. Come on, guys. Come on, mom! This is like the equivalent of asking me to, like, be-- am I by myself here? Oh, just do it! I don't see him going in, in his underwear. No one is giving him a hard time. I was very, very nervous to strip down to my underwear and just waltz into  the water. I'm not in horrible physical condition. You know, this is the west shape i've ever been in. As pathetic as it is to say, this is as good as it gets for me. Oh, no. You work in las vegas. This is normal fur. Work with me! Rip it off n[1]no! What has happened to the youth of this generation. Get your butt in here! Come on! This is so painful. I'm from salt lake city, hello! You guys are lucky I’m not in a turtleneck. Jeff: Cochran's body issues were the first of many personality quirks that  would keep him from fitting in. The guys, myself excluded, have gone out fishing, and the ladies, myself  included, have been tending to the camp. We've got 10. &gt;&gt; [ cheers ] my God! Oh, it's going to be the best day ever! Who wants to gut? Even though I’m not the strongest guy on the tribe there is some sort of cave  man in me that's just waiting to break out. Oh, Cochran, you better be careful. You've got me scared. Turn the machete the other way. He loves this. He lives for this. I'm watching and learning. Please, don't cut your hands. Turns out in order to eat the fish, you first have to tear open its underside  and pull out all the undedesirable organs and whatever the slime is I’m  pulling out of the fish which is out of my comfort zone. Back at home I’m a big fan of animals. I'm a animal lover. I'm all about respecting animal and I feel like the fish respect me. They understand me. They know when I’m gutting them I’m very respectful about it. I don't put fingers anywhere I would not want fingers put in my body. I was willing to do it, although I hope to never have to do it again. Jeff: At Upolu-- looking beautiful. I just want to tell you. Jeff: Coach was not only building a stronger foundation-- you don't know how  lucky it is to have a bunch of workers. Jeff: He was building a family. It's a lot of fun to come out here and play in game with people who care  about camp life, people that care about building a shelter and third time  around, Coach has finally got the leadership role. I appreciate the advice. Checking up on everybody. You raking? You got to. It sneaks up-- you out here. I'm going to do what Coach says. I know that the Savaii camp, they already have food. Ozzy's great at catching fish. He is the great type of Survivor to have out here next to you. And i'll just tell you right now, just being flatont, if I was out here would  I rather have Coach wade on my tribe or Ozzy? I'd rather have Ozzy on my tribe. Give me a break. I'm not a great Survivor. But the perception in our tribe right now is we have it going on. Go crazy on it. I'm very, very glad. I'm grad Coach is here. When jeff told us as as a group there were going to be two people joining us  I was hoping for Coach because Coach has played loyal trice, and you got to  trust the guy. I mean, it may be a mistake for me trusting him, but i'll tell you what, I’m  willing to take that chance. I can get a commitment from you, Coach? Just take me as far as you can. How about if I say the same thing to you. Absolutely. Hey, man, if you're going to be a man of your word, I’m desperate to play  with people like that. Please do. I hope you're not changing just because you're playing the third time. Dude, I’m telling you the third time straight up as a man of job, I can't  change. I have mad respect for Coach. We can change the course of this game. We can make it a more aroundable game. Nobody would have guessed that Russell Hantz's nephew would do something like  that and that's what I want to be known as. I want to be known as an honest player. If that will be my demise so be it. Do you give me your word? As a man of God I give you my word. I give you my word as a man of God. Jeff: Russell Hantz was notorious for sabotaging camp, but his nephew, Brandon  Hantz, sought redemption of the family name by becoming a provider. You going fishing? Yes, sir. Woke up this morning early, felt good, decided to take the boat out. All right, guys. You all stay on the right side. I wanted to kind of butter up my tribe a little bit, see what I could do. Could do. Brandon's going to be the new Ozzy. Never, ever, ever done spear fishing before in my life. It's fun. It's dangerous because of the coral and the waves. Ozzy who? And I like it. Jeff: Although he tried to hide his true identity, sovy had her suspicions  about him. Brandon is so good at fishing, he so good at providing, but I feel like he's  hiding something. He's covering all these tattoos. Really creepy. He could be some, like, reformed,un, ex-gangster ready to praise God for 39  days. So I just need to keep my eye on him. Jeff: Coming up next. Papa bear is a nut, giving me girl advice. I'm ready to be seduced. Pork bath ready. Oh, my stomach. Are you guys really eating that? Mikayla is sick, but I don't care. She's going home next. Âª âª you actually want to go to law school? I do. Jeff: Cochran wasn't a physical threat in challenges or a provider to his  tribe so he had to depend on his social game to integrate himself within Savaii. Now that the shade has moved away I have to inch february further away like a  hermit crab sideways. Cochran is like a kid in a man's body. He looks like a sheltered kid. He looks like he's afraid to do things. I like him. I really do like him. We all like him. He has a good heart. It's almost like I want to father him because I think this experience will be  a good thing for him. Elyse, she's beautiful and smart. If you were in a bar, you would like her, wouldn't you? Yeah. I'd be intimidated, probably. You like somebody, you go up to them-- this is what I want you to do. It's not that different from a guy. You walk over. This is what-- I do that with my hands, kind of slowly. You wear a tight shirt. A tight shirt on top, muscles popping out. This is already a bad idea. You've got to do this. Then you walk over, and you say, "hi, how you doing? Can I tell you something? I really like those earrings." reverse it. I don't think that's going to work at all for me "i really like those  earrings." pamma bear is a nut giving me girl advice. I'll take it but I don't particularly want it. Like my coconut earrings? Oh, yeah, did you see the pickup advice that Papa Bear gave me. The what? How to pick up girls? How. I'll do-- i'll do the act. Please. I'll tell you if it would work on me, okay. Very, very short. You're at the bar. Okay. I spot you-- I’m at the coconut bar. I spot you across the room and I like what I see. So I start wiping my hands like this in a very seductive way. Do it slower. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. I liked it. I'm ready to be seduced. Seduce her! See, it doesn't work. It will work. I saw you at this store across the street and I noticed the earrings you were  wearing. I was going to get them for my sister or something, so where did you get  those ear? And I guess I pivot-- no, you idiot. Then you say something like, "why wheredid you get them?" soft eye  contact. Soft eye contact. Soft, good, good. I'm melting into you. And you say, "you know what? You're a very pretty girl." oh, yeah, I can't do that. Yeah, that's too much. I'm telling you, as a girl. Help her. Don't say, that ever. The earrings, honestly, if you came up and told me that you thought my  earrings were good I would think you were gay. Jeff: If getting shot down wasn't bad enough, at the immunity challenge-- go! Cochran and the rest of Savaii-- Upolu wins immunity and reward. Missed out on pork in their belly. In addition you can take home all the meat you collected. You better believe it, baby! Jeff: Coach was a kind and benevolent father to his family, but not so much  to outsiders, as Mikayla quickly learned when she committed the hainos sin of  overcooping her morning coffee. My system. A mess, man. Because of the pork. It was the last greasy ones we made. I went to bed and it was sitting here and I got it up. Threw you up? Oh, yeah. I don't want to see pork today. I don't want to touch it it. I don't even want to go near it. You freaking kidding me? Just let me vent for a little bit, okay? I'm watching Mikayla, you know. The girl, you know, had two heaping tea spoons of sugar and I know because  i've been out here with nothing. You guys have not been out here with nothing so when I see her without asking  anyone q.b. put two heaping tea spoons in her coffee that bothers me man. I know I’m crazy. I'm venting so I don't say anything to the tribe. Mikayla is a problem. This morning, I fixed eight cups of coffee. I used one teaspoon of cream and sugar kind. And Mikayla, she had one couple of coffee and she put in two scoops of cream  and suggaaar. She's selfish and I was and tired of watching it. I'm thinking of taking some of that fat and put it over thify. You want to eat lard? I want to get a couple pieces in my belly. It smells rank. Keep those flames going, man. I want to roast the fat. Oh, my stomach. Pork fat's ready. Did you eat that? Are you guys really eating that? There's a little bit of bile coming up into my throat. There you go. You are such an ass. I ate pure pig fat. Maybe that was insensitive of me, but I don't care. Mikayla is weak right now. She's sick. Besides, she's going home next. Ouch. Jeff: While Coach was making Mikayla's stomach turn, Cochran was busy making  his own tribe cringe. Gentle rocking? If you want to push, I’m not going to stop you. Tell me a story. Uh, I’m trying to think. I can tell you a kind of disgusting kindergarten story. Oh, good. I'm ready. So I was in kindergarten, and it was nap time and I knew fiwent to the bathroom  during nap time everybody would hear everything I’m doing in the bathroom. Right. So I decided i'd go in my pants. Like in huggies or just pants? No underwear and little khakis. Like I am now. Basically like I am now but three feet tall. Cochran's stories, they could make the world go round, I’m pretty sure. Cochran told this story about kindergarten and a poet accident. I was probably crying or something. I don't know. Oh, yeah. You can't help but love the guy. What a weird kid. The nap time ended, so I got up with everything in my pants, and sat down in  my seat, and everything squished all around. Oh! In my legs and every crevice of my body and I guess the teacher got wise and  she started going around the room sniffing each of our butts. Yeah. And she got to my butt, and of course that's jack pot. You poor thing! Now that I’m in this game, I do like to think I have changed from being that  five-year-old and that that was a teachable and learnable moment in it my  life that I can look back on fondly. I am realizing the five-year-old had nothing to be afraid of. I'm going to bathroom in other places now. Jeff: When Upolu went to tribal council-- half of us are on one side, half of  us are on the other. That's not loyalty. Jeff: Brandon launched into an irrational outburst. Vote me out today if we're going to play disloyal. Jeff: But unlike Mikayla, he was part of the family, so he was forgiven by Coach. So I wanted to ask you, what did you think about tribal last night? What dithink with tribal? Uh-huh. I thought it was ugly. You know. Yeah. He's gotta quit having meltdowns or we're going to be in trouble. Do you think it's going to be a problem once we get to the merge? Yeah. Brandon, if he has another melted down we have to get rid of him. We can't get to the merge and start having a meltdown and telling him the  game plan and he does every time. Brandon can't play this game. The world is very black and white to him, not shades of gray, which in  reality it is. I don't know if he was designed for this, in this phase of his life. I know that he's not but he's honest and you can use that. But it's like the third time. He'll be fine. I'll keep him under control. Brandon has had three meltdowns in tribal council, and two times it's just  random. Three times, that's a pattern. After a merge, what's the likelihood of him having another meltdown the  fourth time? I don't think he can handle the pressure of tribal council. Whatever happens we have to keep strategy talk with brendan to a minimum. He can't handle a big, extended, analytical debate. Like what we do when we scenario map. If this scenario happens we do this. Brandon's eruption at tribal council last night confirmed to a lot of people  nahe really distribute have any business in this game. Brandon is honest. Brandon is loyal. To a fault. I mean, that's the thing. But you know I really have to hope they can channel the honesty into the  right direction. Sit down just for a second man, because i'll just tell you this, right. Everybody freaking loves you, man. They really do, man. They are just concerned that in a moment of black and white honesty, you're  going to just say, "here's what's going on." pray with me, man. Every day is a struggle for me. I know. Lord, I feel so strongly and I have so much faith that you're smiling down on  us now, father, so I ask for a spirit of peace for Brandon. Give him unbelievable self-control when it comes to his tongue. 90% of Brandon is Russell in his stubbornness. Russell just wanted to be stubborn to play the game evilly. Brandon is stubborn to play the game with good. But the demons inside of him will have to be wrestled in order for him to  just be at peace, let alone survive in "Survivor." jeff: Coming up  next-- i've had the distinct pleasure of sleeping in the lover's bungalow  with Keith and Whitney. Thanks, Cochran. If there's a double headed monster prowling the camp, the name is Keith and Whitney. Who is the most powerful man on earth? Hercules. I'm hercules? I'm fearing Coach may at some point devour me. Are you the most powerful man in the game. I like that. Jeff: At Savaii, Cochran was becoming more and more of an outsider. All he could do was watch from the sidelinesses as the others got closer and  closer. Why, thank you. Jeff: Keith and Whitney got so close they treated camp life like a honeymoon. I really do, I like who he is as a person but couples can be dangerous in  this game. So you have to make an effort not to seem too close. Way to go, way to go. Oh, God. Spread it out. So none of them knows we're aligned. I agree. Keith and Whitney's relationship is kind of a pandora's box for me. On the one hand, I really, really like both of them but their super close  relationship is something I hope other people are noticing. I wonder the sleeping arrangements stuff, but I don't think that really  matters and I do not want to, like, snuggle up to Cochran. [ laughing ] getting on your nerves a little? I've had the distinct pleasure of sleeping in the lover's bungalow with Keith  and Whitney for two nights. It's awkward on several levels. They're just wispering and giggling the entire night. They completely take the entire blanket for themselves. I'm freezing my ass off. Thanks Cochran! And they complain if I move the slyest inch during the night. They act like i've created a hoosh sin. I know exactly what was going on with Keith and Whitney in the bungalow. I just don't know if nine months from now we'll discover the product of this  relationship. I feel like we need to kill him soon. Sorry. Jeff: To add insult to injury-- here, Cochran. Jeff: Ozzy went out of his way to put Cochran in uncomfortable situations,  making him the object of ridicule. Is blood going to spurt out. Yes. Hold it down. Hold it close to the bottom. Oh, God. Are you going to watch. Yes, watch! Watch! I was tasked with the parole of holding the body of the rooster as Ozzy swung  the machete. Oh, my goodness. Ozzy said, "Cochran, you're holding the chicken." I mean, that's  kind of what it's like around camp. It's a lot of orders for Cochran. Apparently I was holding it in a way that Ozzy found entertaining. I shouldn't be laughing. Cochran. You were holding it like-- and it was-- oh, my God. I should not be laughing. And I’m sorry I’m laughing but it is just-- I can't help but have the image  burned into my mind of Cochran standing there holding it with his eyes closed  and his mouth open. My mouth was open? Yeah. Oh, my God. That's so gross. I felt for the rooster because I could see that we're not that different. I'm just hoping I don't have the exact same fate he does. I couldn't believe I missed that. I haven't been playing the game so far buts this because this has been the  team game, the tribe game. I always knew I was going to be horrible at the tribe game. Merge time is when I will succeed. I will sliver in and out of every alliance, cut bonds. And when the merge comes if I’m still here, you're going to see it happen. You're going to see it happen. Jeff: Go! With the merge just around the corner. Move it! Jeff: Savaii blew a pivotal immunity challenge. Upolu wins immunity and reward! We did it it it! We did it! Jeff: After the loss-- I’m putting my life on the line. Jeff: You're saying you're going to go to Redemption Island. Yes. Jeff: Ozzy drew up a plan so ridiculous that it just might work. I'm going to tell Christine that Cochran, the little smart keysle he is,  found the idol, kept it from us. We go to vote him out, he whips out the idol, see you later, Ozzy. Not only is Cochran the villain, but he's now the double agent. Jeff: Ozzy's plan sent one of the greatest competitors in "Survivor"  history to Redemption Island. To battle it out against Christine, who was on a roll, having won five duels  in a row. At the duel-- Ozzy has all three keys. Christine has none. Christine fell to five and one. Ozzy wins the duel and is back in this game. Yes! Jeff: And the first part of Ozzy's gamble paid off. You and everybody else here can drop their buffs because we are merged. And when the two tribes merged-- looking good. Jeff: Coach was less than impressed by his rifle Ozzy's Survivor skills. What do you want to do about the sleeping. I. I wake up and like bugs crawling on me. There's bugs all on you. Is that what you said? Yeah, usually. We were almost exactly where the mat is. We've been doing it under the stars. This is unbelievable. Ozzy has played this game before. These other people, they don't know any better. "Survivor" is not sleeping on the floor getting bit up by  mosquitoes and alling kinds of bugs. Just because you're a beach bum and can sleep on the sand because you've been  doing that your whole life does not mean you subject your tribe to that. Is this where the cool people sleep? Yeah. Where do you sleep? Not in here. Keith and Whitney typically sleep in here? Who else? Sometimes there's a third person. I at one point a third person. I guess I toss and turn too much. It's annoying. So i've been ejected. This is pathetic. You have a lovemaking couple over there with Whitney and Keith shacking up in  their own little love nest? Who lives like that? Who allows people to live like that? Are you kidding me? Ozzy no wonder you never won "Survivor." you're a frigging idiot. Ozzy you call yourself an all-star Survivor and you want tow come here and  build a shelter like that? You should be ashamed of yourself. Jeff: On the newly formed Te Tuna's tribe first night, the former Upolus were  restless. This is terrible. I'd rather sleep down from a garbage dump than the fire. [ laughter ] that fire kills you. I feel like I’m going to barf. It is. We'll put a "snow smoking" sign up. Jeff: But Coach looked past the smoke and saw an opportunity. Cochran is sleeping by himself. Jim and Dawn are cuddled up next to each other with a pillow and blanket. Whitney and Keith are covered up with a pillow and a blanket, and Ozzy is  sleeping by the fire. I mean, how messed up is that? Somebody like Cochran. That boy doesn't know how to survive out here. That is not going to stand on Coach wade's watch. That kind of stuff pisses me off. You know what, Cochran? Come over here. I've got room under my wing for you. Jeff: The next morning Coach used all of his star power to bedazzle Cochran  to contemplating a jump from sixth at Savaii to sieving at Upolu. Give me a hug, man. Give me a hug. How you feeling, man? Feeling good. Huh? Feeling good. You ready for a little chat, man? You mind breaking away? No strategy it's mythology. Mythology. Greek mythology. Are you ready for this? Do I have to kneel for this? I will be the one kneeling, man. I identify with Cochran for so many levels. I see somebody not blessed with the best fezeeb. I see somebody blessed with an incredible mind. Imagine what his life has been like. Imagine what his self-esteem has been like. Nobody has giften him self-confidence in his life outside his family. Anything I can do to give him courage and make him feel valued and prospects,  I will do. This is a mixture of greek mythology, and greek history. But you have to agree to like these names, okay? Absolutely. Not your name. That's-- that's not questioned. You have names for different people? Yes, that's the thing and I never thought I would use it-- we'll start with Ozzy. Okay. Okay? Without question, Ozzy isinar sisis, because as you know the story, wheninar  sisis looked into the water because he was so infatuated with himself he  became unaware of the world around him. Whitney is eroto, and she was the most beautiful of the nine. The next one would be Edna. I said she is echo. And echo, obviously, spoke so much-- Coach came up with identities for every  single member of the Te Tuna tribe. And a lot of them are not so flattering. Finally, at last, you are the most powerful man in the game. Okay? Okay. Really. Who is the most powerful God? Who was the strongest, strongest man on earth they called him? Hercules. Yeah. I'm hercules. I'll tell you why. The raging bull of minos was stronger than hercules and &amp; what hercules  did that most people don't know is he used his brain to beat the bull. He mounted the bull and forced it to swim up the river all the way to the  capital, and by the time they had gotten to the capital, the bull was tired. Hercules jumped off of him and slew him. That is very appropriate. It's extremely appropriate. Damn right it's appropriate. Coach in dubbing me hercules is quite literally entered me into the panthon  of "Survivor" God. I've earned his respect and trust and now I’m wearing the iconic Coach  jacket, the floral patterns. I'm sure there's some sort of dragon insignia somewhere on here and I feel  like the dragon blood that flows through his veins is entering my pours and  my blood stream. I thought my name should be zeus because zeus is fogerly, right? He looks after everybody, and if somebody wrongs one of his children, he is  ruthless in retribution. I like that. I'm one of your children. Despite Coach's claims that zeus is a doting father, I seem to think zeus ate  his children, and if he views me as one of his children, as he kind of  repeatedly has, I’m fearing that Coach at some point may devour me. Zeus, hercules. Jeff: Coming up next-- let's eat the chicken. What else can you do? Are you kidding me? Son of a gun! There's a point in time when you screw up and you have to take ownership of  that action. You still have an opportunity to come with us. You have my word me and you to the end. Dude, was I born yesterday? Ozzy was lying. Jeff: Everyone knows Ozzy's strengths are in challenges and providing, but  for him to find redemption, he knew that he needed to play a better social  game. On day 20, it would have been a great move if he had used his talents to make  some friend among the old Upolu tribe. I've been the provider for my tribe since the first freaking week of this  game, but once you get to the merge, being a provider really is a liability. I only got three we're merged together and there's 12 of us, and part of me  was thinking,un, it's a shame that i've got to share all this food with the  former Upolu members that basically voting against us. So I’m just trying to keep my tribe strong and unified as much as possible. I don't know, should we just eat the fish us, or what? I don't want to play like that, do you? It always gets tough to feed the competition. I'm totalee tribe. It's hard for me to be-- yeah, yeah. Mean. Yeah. And that feels mean for me, so I’m good. I'm totally the same tribe. I'm just trying to figure out how to do it and not feel like an ass. You're right you're right. I'm sorry. It's such a selfish game at the end of the day, and I think I’m realizing  today that, you know, maybe being a mom of six is-- I’m not used to being so  foixed on preserving myself. You know, because the best thing you can do as a parent is take care of  everybody. Thank you for getting that. Feeding the competition is kind of a weird idea. You know what I mean? Yeah, it's understandable. Just don't win. That was a little bit rude. And I don't look at you guys as enemies by the way. I give Ozzy a lot of credit. He is by far the best physical player here on this island. It's going to be good, man. It's not how you start, though. It's how you finish. And if he is wanting to do the wrong thing, play the game for himself, I think  it's definitely going to bite him in the butt. I know how to play that game. Thank you again for this, man. Of course. I'll go with it because Ozzy is going home. Jeff: On kay 21, Ozzy won immunity and was safe at tribal council. So he tried to use his social game to play Coach. Little did he know, Coach was playing him, too. You're not going home tonight. You guys are looking pretty good, man. It's pretty much not in our favor, man. You guys-- oh, man. Worst-case scenario, man, is that you guys would win. I know. I hate it, man. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. I know. It's-- I wanted to play this game so bad with you, man. Yeah, and I mean, you still have an opportunity to come with us. And I would guarantee you coming to the end with me. I would screw my tribe over. This could possibly secure the top six. We have the numbers on our side. And I hope Coach sees the writing on the wall. I will basically guarantee Coach the final two. Not really, but of course that's what I have to tell him. You have my word that me and you to the end. And all I can do is offer you that. Dude, was I born yesterday? Absolutely, Ozzy. Let's play this game together and let me just vote off my tribe. Nicci once said when you have more arrogance, you have less wisdom. I really appreciate you talking to me. Especially since you hold all the cards. I don't ever want to say Coach is in control but I really think I’m in  control. In this game the weak will become the strong and the strong will become the  weak. That's what Cochran will do for the game. Jeff: At tribal council when Cochran did flip he took out one of his own. Eighth person voted out the "Survivor: South Pacific." Ozzy, once  again, the tribe has spoken. Even with Savaii's numbers dwindling, keeping the Upolu family intact was a  constant struggle. By day 23, Brandon's antics were leading to increasingly greater concerns  that he was becoming a liability. I wonder if they got request fish. Probably not. How to go, Brandon! Ozzy was amazing at catching fish. You know, you gotta give the man his props. I tried to catch fish out here. This current is crazy. Sometimes the current is too bad to even go out. I was unsuccessful. Thanks for going out. Everyone here is absolutely starving. We don't have have many options as far as food is concerned right now. But we do have the chickens. That will make us one little bite. Dude, we're going to eat a piece of egg about this big. Let'sing be real. We eat coconuts with everything, man. Then let's eat the chicken. Let's kill the chicken. Yeah, I think we should. I made my decision and I made it known. Let's kill the chicken. Let's eat the chicken. Son of a gun. Hey! No good. Hey, get that chick own this side, guys! Smart chicken. He grabbed by the feathers. You're supposed to grab by the feet. It's a chicken, you grab it by the neck and spin it around and kill it or  bite its head off. If you want to be cool, stretch it out and bite it. Son of a gun. This sucks. And withstandon, who is already in a bad mood, is the one when let chicken go  so he's going to go... And do a downward spiral. We're not killing that one, are we? Are you kidding me? Killing a chicken at this point is not the smartest thing to do. We go from two chickens to zero chickens in, like, 20 seconds here. Sorry about that, guys. Having zero chickens because one flew the coop and the other is now dead is  preporterous. And there's a point in time you screw up and you have to take ownership of  that action. I grabbed him and he just-- I should have grabbed him by the neck. The wheels are slowly but surely starting to come off the Brandon Hantz train. He's so intulsive sometimes. He's only a kid. He's 19 years old. You have to coral him a lot of times and reel him back in but I don't know if  I feel that comfortable investing my trust in him, invest my well-being in  the game. I'm sorry, brother. Brandon losing the chicken. Maybe Brandon can pray for it and it will show back up. Jeff: Brandon's instability wasn't the only threat facing Coach's leadership. Albert's selfish ambitions bubbled to the surface when he pitched sovieto a  plot to break up the family. If we get Brandon next, using Whitney and Dawn who are going to be scrambling  to do anything. Obviously we can't do that right now. He's an extremely dangerous person. I don't think we should vote out Brandon first. There's no point. Brandon could win immunity. I'm not terrified that Brandon is going to go on an immunity win. He's not. I think Albert thinks he has this great strategic mind and I don't think he's  come up with one good plan yet. His recent plan is get rid of Brandon sooner. I don't see the in that. Everyone is going to go along with getting out Savaii. Everyone is going to go along with getting out Brandon. The last thing I want is for things to be shaken up. What's the point in pissing Brandon off. He could come back. I think mixing things up this early is crazy because people like Rick are  going to say we screwed things up. Albert is the one who is always feeling uncomfortable. He is also wanting to make a big move. You go against thify, you go against the six. Yeah, we're going to throw you in the fire. We'll chop your head off. Jeff: 10 casts ways are left as the end draws near. I don't want to see your last day here be filled with bitterness. Jeff: Can an underdog outwit the maiority. Which castaways will make it to the final tribal council. Then I cant trust Coach then. You're not going to do this for me? After all i've done for you, you're not going to do this for me. Jeff: Which alliance will outlast the rest. I don't feel indebted to you. Jeff: As the adventure continues. Captioning brought to you by Survivor productions, cbs, media access group at  wgbh access.wgbh.org jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. Jeff: Next time on "Survivor": Everybody's fighting to be standing  at the bitter end. You make me happy to see you go father than Rick in this game. Are you going to be my friend? Unless you stab me in the back. I'm on board. We can kick him off. With my last dying breath, I will fight to keep my young warrior. Y. Keith always has this way of talking to me and everything he says is a sports  metaphor. You can't reanalyze like that, Cochran. You can't request to court like that. You keep asking questions. You have to keep your game faceo, game mode, sport mode or you're going to  fumble. You can't fumble in the game of life man. I don't know what you do when you're back on the court at home.
