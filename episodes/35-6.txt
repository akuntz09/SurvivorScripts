<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," at the Levu  tribe, there was a clear divide. <br/>It's 2-2, I’m sticking with you. <br/>Jeff: At the Yawa tribe, Cole couldn't hide his hunger. <br/>He licks everything. He's like a pig. <br/>Jeff: At the Soko tribe, Ryan found himself caught between  a Hero --  Vote for Roark. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Get rid of Chrissy. <br/>Chrissy? All right. <br/>There's going to be one person who is going to hate me. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Ryan voted with Chrissy. Roark. And betrayed Ali. The tribe has spoken. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Jeff: 13 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>What do you want to do, Ryan? What do you want to do? You say, oh, JP Or Chrissy or JP Or Chrissy. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Why can't you just tell me? <br/>Because she and you were getting really, really close. <br/>Ryan, really? <br/>Tribal council went exactly as planned. Ryan did follow through on his word, which is amazing. It showed me that Ryan believes that he can get further with me  in this game than he can get with Ali. <br/>You never told me anything. Like this is suppose to be a two-people conversation and you  never said anything. <br/>Because I thought that you were too close. <br/>I don't care. This is a game, Ryan. You tell me how you feel. I trust you. I feel like I told you everything. <br/>And she did not tell me everything. <br/>Who cares about her. Then why didn't you tell me? <br/>Because you were close to her. <br/>I knew this girl for four  days. That's the thing. You didn't trust me. <br/>I do trust you. That's why you're still her. I didn't trust her. That's why she's gone. <br/>Why didn't you tell me? <br/>You were really close to her, Ali. You really were. <br/>Four days. <br/>That's all it takes. We voted together. We were together for six days. <br/>Tribal council was a shock. I was betrayed by my closest ally in this whole entire thing,  you know? And it hurts. <br/>Wait. <br/>You thought I would kick you to the curb, Ryan? <br/>No, she was going to. <br/>I would never have kicked  you to the curb, so why wouldn't you tell me. <br/>Because I thought...  I said 100 times I wasn't  going to come out here and cry, but, you know, it's rough, and I just want to  do my best. <br/>Were you in an alliance with you? <br/>New york I was in an alliance with her. <br/>I would have didn't  whatever you wanted me to do, Ryan. <br/>That's not true. <br/>Being pushed down to the bottom, it's a wake-up caulk  because moving forward, I have to understand, it's just me, because I don't  think I will ever trust Ryan again in this game. <br/>I love Chrissy. I think she's great. <br/>You just wrote Chrissy's name down. <br/>Because I thought that's what you wanted as well. Why are you getting so mad? <br/>How am I getting mad? <br/>So Ali rails into me, and it was a really bad look for  her. I was hoping I could still work with Ali at this point. Unfortunately Ali is infuriated with me because I didn't tell  her, and it stinks because I can't have enemies in this game. So she may have to go. So she may have to go. <br/>Oh, my God, first time catching fish with a speargun, it  is amazing. It's like I can do this. I can do anything that I put my heart and mind to. Little fish. It's still a fish. I am providing for my tribe. I am so excited to be able to be like, yeah, dude, I caught the  fish, too. <br/>Nice. <br/>It's not much, but it's something. <br/>Do you feel like man? <br/>Yeah. <br/>The simple things in life can be so rewarding. <br/>Flame broiled. Fish filet. <br/>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. [laughter]  He's gone, doc. <br/>No, he's not gone. <br/>He's gone. <br/>That's okay. My fish is not gone. He just cooked a little faster. [laughter]  Oh, I’m is glad we're on a tribe together, Mike. <br/>Mikey, that poor guy, he was determined, though. That man never gave up. Through hell or high water, Mike was cooking that fish, and  eating it. I'm proud of him. He's out of his element, an he's doing good. What do you think, not batting right? <br/>No, man. I think it would be good. Thanks for sharing. You know, Mike caught a small fish and he shared that. Cole caught a decent-sized fish, and he ate it for himself a  couple times that. Shows right there who you should work with in this game. Someone who is going the share and think about others or someone  who is just going to think about himself. Cole is showing his true colors. And they ain't good. <br/>So should we get started on the rice? <br/>The only thing is we don't have a lot of rice. <br/>I’m good. <br/>I’m not even hungry. <br/>I’m happy waiting. <br/>I don't think we should  cut out a whole meal. That's not how your body works. <br/>That's how it has to work here because we don't have that  much food. I'm just trying to be realistic. <br/>Please don't cut me off. I was trying to talk and you kind of dominate conversations. <br/>Talk, buddy. Talk till your heart can't have no more. <br/>Eat big while you have it. <br/>I’m saying nobody here is  starving to chew, and we can't just feed you. I mean, if you want the eat your rice, cook it. <br/>That's fine. <br/>I said we'll go with what  we decided. I'm not getting enough food at all, and it's stupid. I'm not going to be strong enough at any challenge to guarantee  that we'll come away winning, and I really need a bigger serving because  without me, there wouldn't be any victory for the Yawa tribe. <br/>I’m sick of him. I am so sick of him. <br/>He's tripping out. <br/>He's a piece of work is what he is. <br/>I'd like to say that he's 24, but when we were 24, we  weren't like that. <br/>No. We'll let him seal his own fate. <br/>The two of them, they're trying to be a power couple or  what. <br/>They're together. <br/>You make me nervous sometimes. <br/>Why do I make you nervous? <br/>Because I forget how to talk to really pretty girls. <br/>She's smart girl. I can't imagine her going to live in a van with him, because  he's not going the leave the van. <br/>And the way he throws fits when he doesn't get his way. <br/>I think Mike is starting  to see what Cole's true colors are, which is great for me, because I’m at the  bottom of this group. So we need dr. Mike. You know, the more Cole screws up, the more he acts like an idiot,  the better off I am. Cole is digging his own grave. [ theme song playing]  Jeff: Come on in, guys. Yawa, Levu, getting your first look at the new Soko tribe. Roark voted out at the last tribal council. All right you guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge you'll race out the a set of  poles. We'll use those poles to transport a buoy across a bAlance beam. That buoy will release your boat. You'll pull your boat to the finish, where you will use a giant  slingshot to knock down two targets. First two tribes to finish win reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Please. <br/>Jeff: Let me tease you as long as I can for pizza. <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Ten pizzas and ice cold soft drinks, second tribe  the finish, one pizza to share with the tribe. For the losers, nothing. Yawa, you have one extra person, sitting somebody out whom is it  going to be. <br/>I'll sit out. <br/>Jeff: Mike, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else take a minute to strategize. We'll get it on. All right. Here we go. For reward, Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, Ali, go, JP <br/>Jeff: Ben. Ali takes hard fall. She's with JP And Ashley and Desi, you have to transport that using these two  poles over a bAlance beam and down to the mat. Everybody good out of the gate. Desi and Ashley drop. They have to go back. Ben and Cole drop. They have to go back. <br/>Go, go, go. Keep going, keep going. <br/>Jeff: JP And Ali making it look easy. You're good. Big lead for Soko. Chrissy and Ryan, no buoy to transfer. Just get through the course. There goes Ashley and Desi again. They drop again. Got to go back. Chrissy and Ryan heading over the beam. A lot easier with no buoy to transfer. Ben and Cole trying again. Can they do it this time? Yes. You're good. Drop it. Go, and Jessica on the course. Soko now has everybody. They're headed to their boat. Soko now at their boat. Got to untie those knots before you can head out. Desi and Ashley drop for the third time. Lauren's across. Jessica's across. Go, Yawa. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Let's go. Get it. <br/>You guys, you're catching them. You got this. <br/>Jeff: You got to pull yourself all the way to your  platform. Soko is stuck. You got to untie. <br/>We did. <br/>There's one in the back. <br/>Jeff: Soko forgot to untie one of the knots, a huge  setback. <br/>Go! Go, go, go, go go,! <br/>Jeff: Jessica whips through the knot. Yawa caught up now. Chrissy finally has the knots untied. It's a race to the platform. We are dead even. Yawa and Soko have had a huge head start in this challenge. They're heading out to the slingshot. Ashley and Desi have got to get across. <br/>Together, together. <br/>Jeff: And they do. You're good. Devon and Joe now have to rip through this course, trying to  close this gap. You got to get over that beam. Joe struggling. Got away on Joe. <br/>It's easy, it's easy. <br/>Jeff: You're good. Blue has got to pick it up now. Ben is to the platform. JP To the platform. Levu trying to get back in this. You have one slingshot and two targets. <br/>Come on, JP <br/>Jeff: It's going to be Ben for Yawa, JP For Soko. <br/>A little higher. <br/>Drew: And here comes Levu trying to get back in this. JP Just short. Ben just short. <br/>Get up there. <br/>Jeff: Levu finally across. Levu is back in this now. Ben really leaning back. Ben misses. The swells really coming in on this challenge, making it very  difficult to judge, because everything is moving. The platform is moving, the boats are moving. Nothing is easy on "Survivor."  Yeah! <br/>Jeff: JP Connects for Soko. Soko now with one target left. Ben one more time on his knees and connects. Yawa knocks their first target down. Joe going to pop out. It's Devon in now. Here comes a huge swell. JP Taking his time, waiting for the swell. Everybody's platform moving all over the place now. Boats are everywhere, platforms are everywhere. The ocean is moving today. You got to be lined up right. You have to anticipate the swells. Adjustments being made by everybody. You got to earn it out here every day on "Survivor." JP Has waited patiently. JP Does it. Soko wins reward, pizzas and soft drinks. Looking for second. Yawa wins reward! <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>JP, that was so awesome. <br/>Jeff: Soko, nice victory. Ten pizzas will be waiting for you back at camp. Should make for a very nice and well-earned afternoon. Grab your stuff. Head back. Enjoy the pizza in fiji. Yawa, one pizza waiting for you back at camp. Nice job. Grab your stuff, head back, enjoy it. Levu, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. <br/>I don't like to be in the  limelight that much, but in this case, it's just good for my game, because  bottom line is they need more 100%. Without me there's in way they would be able to get through any challenge. No way. <br/>Oh, my gosh, there's like salami. <br/>Artichoke and mushroom. <br/>It's more fun to eat a whole pizza. <br/>This was the one to win. <br/>Sitting there watching them struggle and JP Do it with ease. <br/>Basking in his glory. <br/>You were so good with that slingshot. <br/>JP Is a tank in these challenges. I guess being a firefighter he has that strength to him, but he  is very athletic. And the merge is going to happen very soon. The physical part of the game is a very big aspect, and that  raises the threat level of JP <br/>My ideal first date is bonfire on the beach. <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah, pick dinner up somewhere. Most of the time I do a salad. <br/>He's also somebody who is tough to read because he doesn't  talk much strategy at all. JP Likes talking about chicks and bars and stuff that I don't know  anything about. He really just has no clue what's going on in this game. <br/>I put it back in my  truck. Big salad to go. You sit on the beach and share, make a fire on the beach, hang  out, look at the stars. <br/>Nothing like some wood in the back of the truck. <br/>Yeah. <br/>JP Doesn't understand that this is a social game. And it's amazing that he's still here. So if we go the tribal council, maybe taking out a big, physical  threat right before the merge should be priority number one. <br/>Wait, wait. <br/>Our camp, when you were looking at the well, this is your  stomach, this is the water, where was the idol? <br/>Where I looked initially. So what do you think? <br/>Do you think they would go to rocks for each other? Or do you think Desi would flip? <br/>I think Desi would flip. <br/>If there is an immunity challenge here shortly with this  tribe, I am nervous. There's only four ofous, two yellow, Joe and Desi, and then me  and Devon, who are pretty much like this. We're kind of an unbreakable alliance. <br/>I want to make the merge. <br/>Don't flip on me. <br/>I’m not going to flip on  you. <br/>In the case of the tribal council, it's look like it would  be 2-2. The plan would be to get Desi to flip on Joe. <br/>High as well take some of this, right? <br/>Keep your eyes out for coconuts. The energy is very tense around here. I feel like there's a hidden immunity idol still out, there and Joe  is good at finding idols. He's already found one. That's better than my record. <br/>Big hermit crowd some everythi that Joe does is suspicious. We're us a looking out for him and looking to see where he's  looking. <br/>Beastly. <br/>I got the keep eagle eyes  on Joe. He's got me nervous. <br/>You guys are really close, but Joe is the most strategic  player we've met. He could be getting anyone to trust him just as long as it works  for him. <br/>Definitely had that thought. <br/>Do you really feel like you can trust him? <br/>Yeah. I mean, I trust him as far as... I thing he'll stick with us to  a point. It's just matter of to what point. <br/>Let me ask you this, would you vote him out? <br/>Oh, yeah. I think if he doesn't get voted out, he wins this game. Ashley brought up the idea of getting rid of Joe. I mean, I trust Joe to the point that he'll use me as an advance  for himself in this game. Beyond that, Joe is arguably the most strategic player out here,  willing to do whatever it takes to make himself move further in this game. That's going to maybe not always benefit me. So if the Levu tribe has to go back the tribal council I am actually  considering getting rid of Joe at this time. <br/>You got water? <br/>I’m good. <br/>You don't drink enough water, man. I'm going to check up on you a little bit more. <br/>Forget about that stuff, man. I'm not stupid. I know Devon is watching me because I’m dangerous. Like I’m always searching for idols and looking for idols. My game is to have power, control, and to manipulate. And I've been trying the find a clue. I just need some time alone to find it. Oh, my God. It took four days to find it. But I finally found a clue. Very similar to the Healer camp. I knew it, you know what I’m saying? I knew about the well. It just happened to be four feet away instead of five feet. I didn't really give Devon any reaction. <br/>Nothing. <br/>I definitely want to get  rid of the clue later. This time around, no one is going to know that I have it. That's what I wanted initially. When I found first one, Cole. This time around if I get the immunity idol new york one is  going to know that I have the idol. That right there is true power. I will be getting that idol tonight. I will be getting that idol tonight. This is not a vacation for me. It's work. Find another idol that represents moving further in the game,  and the further I get, the closer I get the that $1 million. The closer I can provide that much more for my children. You know, I tell my kids all the time, things don't come easy. You have to put in the work. And, you know, my kids are my motivation. Everything I do is for them. If I had to dig a hole the length of tennessee, I’m going to do  it. Oh, man. Hello, baby. I've been at two camps. This is my second idol I've found. I'm going to keep it a secret. If I move on to the merge, guess what, I’m going to find the  third idol. <br/>Gross. A worm literally just fell on me. Do you want it to eat. <br/>I’m good. <br/>A worm just fell out of our roof on me. That's gross. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Right? <br/>That's why I cover my ears. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>How did you do that. Cole? Are you okay? <br/>What? <br/>Cole? <br/>What happened? <br/>Just lay down. Lay down. Put your legs up. Lay like that with your legs up a little bit. Do we have water for him? Keep your legs up. Whatting just happened? <br/>He just passed out. <br/>I thought I was standing  up over there, and the next thing I’m dreaming or something. <br/>He needs to eat. He can have my portion of rice. <br/>I feel good now. <br/>Of course you do. You just passed out. <br/>No, but I'll just chill and take it easy. <br/>I’m going to cook some  rice. Cole faipghted. My initial feeling is just straight fear, like all of us are  scared. But dr. Mike and I were in control, we knew to get fluid in him. We knew to get food. He did with it two Healers in the healthcare world. <br/>I’m really going to be  okay. <br/>We know you're going to be okay. <br/>I just stood up too fast. <br/>No, you didn't, you are depleted. That's what you are. It's a food-related issue. I felt bad for him. I literally just wanted to hold him. And in that moment I realized that I really do care for him a  lot more than I thought I did. I'm not ready to play this game put Cole. Dinner is served. <br/>I feel so ridiculous. I just feel like a burden. <br/>Just eat it. <br/>Cole, you okay over there? <br/>Yeah, I’m good. <br/>Cole's going to be fine. We just got to make sure he's fine. But Cole has become a liability. If you don't feel well enough on day 16, how are you going to  feel on day 17 and 18 or 23? We're just going to have to keep pulling and pulling him along,  and at some point the scales are like... We need the get rid of Cole. Nothing exciting here happened while you were gone. Cole could not pass out. <br/>He got up and passed out. <br/>Wow. <br/>Fell like a tre trunk. <br/>Take it easy, big guy. Drink some water. <br/>Thanks for having my back. <br/>I don't know, doc. He should have worried about his appetite more than his six  pack. Pack on a few pounds, you know? He's a liability. <br/>Oh yeah,. I agree. We take out Cole. <br/>Exactly. We can't pander and cater to him and baby him any longer. <br/>I agree. <br/>Out. It's funny how things work in this game. When Cole fell over, he sealed his fate. I feel bad saying, that but it's true. I think Lauren and doc have the same agenda as I do, so if we do  lose and immunity challenge, jess' boyfriend is gone. <br/>Just know that as long as I’m not passed out on the  ground, I’m here for you and I care about you. <br/>Thanks, Cole. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. Let's get to today's immunity challenge. First things first, I will take back the idols. Desi, you don't want to give it up. <br/>New york I’m taking good care of her. <br/>Oh, I’m sorry. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Lauren. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will each pull on a rope suspending a  disk. You'll then work together to stack blocks on that disk spelling  "Immunity." if at any point you fall off or your tack drops, you  tart again. First two tribes to finish win immunity, safe from the vote. Losers tribal council will somebody will be the sixth person  voted out of this game. Yawa, one extra person, sitting somebody out. Dr. Mike sat out of the reward challenge. Who is going to sit out of this one? Lauren take a spot on the bench. Everybody else take a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Joe, you're first. <br/>Jeff: It's all about communecation. <br/>Now Ryan, pull it tight. <br/>Jeff: Working together to spell immunity. Remember, you are spelling it from the bottom to the top. Ben places the first block for Yawa. <br/>A little tighter, Ryan. <br/>Jeff: Ryan out quickly. <br/>Perfect. That's right. <br/>Jeff: Joe has first letter for Levu. <br/>I'll be next. <br/>Jeff: It's all about keeping that disk flat. <br/>Ryan, pull a little bit, buddy. <br/>Jeff: And bAlanced. <br/>Ben, pull a little harder. <br/>Jeff: As this stack gross, it's going to get more difficult. Jessica with their second letter. Desi with their second letter. <br/>You're pulling it up. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy working for their second letter. <br/>Ryan, pull a little, budsdy. <br/>JP, I think you're too tight. <br/>My way? <br/>Jeff: Ben places the I for Yawa. Levu with three. Soko coming with their third. Here comes Ryan inching closer with that I. Already you can see how much movement there is. Very close to losing it early in this challenge. <br/>Ryan you're, too tight. <br/>Jeff: Soko has the start over, our first casualty. Levu now in the lead with the fifth letter. Here comes Cole now with that fifth letter. Soko starting over. Ashley places the sixth block. Levu getting very close. Putting the pressure now on Yawa. There's Jessica with the sixth block. <br/>There you go. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy has the third block for Soko. Here comes Desi. <br/>No, no, no, don't pull. <br/>Jeff: Desi, they're in trouble. Levu drops just like that and Yawa is now in the lead. That is how quickly this can change. <br/>Pull more, Ryan. <br/>Ryan! <br/>Jeff: And Soko drops. Both tribes now starting over. <br/>We got it, guys. <br/>Jeff: Dr. Mike now for Yawa. They have a huge advantage, only one block left to win immunity  and a lot of time while Soko and Levu battle it out for the second immunity. <br/>Keep breathing, guys. Don't move your arms. <br/>Jeff: Here goes Cole. He's making his moves. Cole can win it for Yawa right here. <br/>Go ahead, Cole, slowly. <br/>Jeff: Can Cole finish it right here? <br/>She -- slow and steady. <br/>Jeff: Cole has the I. They are steady. Now he just has to get back to the finish without any movement  and there goes the move. And Yawa is out. Yawa has to start over. They were just a few footsteps away from immunity. The door is back open. It is now Levu and Soko dead even with five blocks each. This is how fast this game changes. Ben is new racing out with that first block. It is now Ashley with the sixth block. <br/>There we go. We straight now. <br/>Jeff: Here comes Ali with the sixth block. This would tie them with Levu. <br/>We got this. <br/>Jeff: Yawa with two, quickly chasing everybody. Here comes Cole with the third letter. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy now with the seventh letter for Soko. Levu right on their heels with their seventh letter. <br/>We got the tension, Mike. You just walk. <br/>Mike, we got the rope. <br/>Jeff: Yawa with a completely new strategy, racing to catch  up. Mike now with the fourth letter. We have Levu and Soko both with seven letters, just one letter  left. Yawa is already halfway there. Mike with their fifth. Yawa's strategy may be paying off. <br/>Just walk it back, Mike. <br/>Jeff: Here comes JP With that final letter. <br/>Just go slow. <br/>Jeff: He cannot move as fast as Yawa is because the stack  is so tall. Devon moving very slowly. <br/>Whoa, whoa, Devon. <br/>Jeff: Jessica coming out now with their seventh letter. <br/>You guys got it? <br/>Yep, we have it. <br/>Jeff: JP Very close. <br/>Careful, JP <br/>Jeff: But that tower is leaning. Jessica places the seventh letter for Yawa. Devon now making his move. <br/>Slowly. <br/>Careful, JP <br/>JP <br/>Jeff: JP Places the I, but he's got to get it to stick. <br/>Take you time. <br/>Drew: Jessica new racing out with the I. Everybody is in it now. <br/>Get it. <br/>You're doing good, dev. <br/>Jeff: Devon places the I, but he knows it is wobbly. <br/>Do not let it drop. <br/>Jeff: Jessica places if I for Yawa. <br/>Everybody has their blocks. It's now a race to the finish. <br/>Get back, jess. <br/>Don't move. Nobody move. <br/>We win. <br/>We got it. <br/>Jeff: Yawa wins immunity. We're looking for second. Soak second dropped. Soko is out now. Levu has a shot right here. Levu wins immunity, safe from tribal council. Sending Soko for the sixth person voted out of this game. Yawa, congratulations. Nobody going home tonight. Levu, everybody will live to see another day. All right. Yawa, Levu, no tribal council tonight. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. Enjoy the night off. All right. Soko, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal where somebody will be the sixth  person voted out of this game. <br/>After tribal I had a blow-up with Ryan, so I know that my  name has been on the line, and I’m more nervous than I probably ever have  been. <br/>I think Jeff likes us. We always have a lot of dates with him, huh? <br/>Yep. <br/>Well, today's challenge didn't go so well, but losing for  us right now is just not a big deal. Ali is next, and she has nothing she can do about it. Simple as that. <br/>Sucks to lose, but sometimes...  I did not want to lose. <br/>It all works out for the better. <br/>Yeah. Ali is the obvious next target, but JP Is a huge physical threat. I mean, he has literally carried us, he's carried me through a  challenge, literally. Taking that guy into a merge, that's dangerous. <br/>As long as it's not me, I really don't care. My vote is Ali. <br/>Me too. And so is Chrissy. But in order to vote out JP, I need to make up with Ali. She trusted me a lot, and I did backstab her. I need her to get rid of JP For this vote. <br/>I’m sorry. I should have told you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>That was a huge mistake. I was petrified of Roark. <br/>I’m just petrified I’m going  home. <br/>I do not think that. I have your back. And I know that's incredibly hard for you to accept right now,  but that's true. <br/>After the last tribal council, I was definitely on the  outs, but I think I found my crack. I just have to make it one more vote until the merge, one or two  at the most. <br/>Well maybe we should do JP <br/>He was dominant today. <br/>He's within dominant every day. <br/>And he lays low a lot. <br/>I don't know where his  head is. <br/>That's scary. <br/>I still can't trust Ryan,  but he definitely sees JP Is a threat. <br/>We need Chrissy to come over. <br/>I'll talk to her first and see what she thinks. Now I need to get with Chrissy. I know that I voted for Chrissy, but the thing is, I know that Chrissy  is a very smart person. It just doesn't make sense to keep JP <br/>I think so far in this  game my downfall has been my loyalty. I think that I just put it in the wrong person. I know I have Lauren 100%. And I know I have a great relationship with Devon. Going forward I am loyal, and I want the prove it to you. <br/>I was thinking this is  probably the last vote out before the merge. So it doesn't matter to me what makes this four-man team strong. What matters to me is who can I beat once we get to the merge. <br/>I definitely think that JP's  going to go out there and strut. You see how he is. He's going the try and win everything. <br/>Yes, yes. <br/>You know, I feel like I could put the loyalty that I put  in Ryan in you. <br/>Ali told me that she's  extremely loyal and going forward she really wants to work together and get  rid of JP I think that JP Is a threat, but truthfully, Ali voted for me last tribal  council, so I don't know if I can even trust Ali moving forward. The one person I am most closely Aligned with is Ryan, and  together we need to make the decision on which of the two goes home tonight. <br/>I wanted to play with  people who like...  Like love the game, want the play the game. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>Either way we're good. <br/>I’m is happy. I told you I wanted to play the game with you. I know. JP And Ali are polar opposites, yet concurrently they both want to  work with me and Chrissy. I don't know why everybody wants to work with me. I think I’m a freakin' weasel, but the closer you are to  somebody, they can't really see you go behind their back and backstab them. <br/>Jeff: So the roller coaster continues for the Soko tribe. Ryan, after the last tribal, which was clearly a blind side,  what happened back at camp. <br/>Yeah, so Ali was not pleased. You know, she had been on the wrong side of the Roark vote, so I  had just told her my reasoning behind it. I really felt Roark was going to flip back to that strong Healer  contingency that's still in the game up to this point. <br/>Jeff: Ali, I’m guessing you said, you could have told me that. <br/>Yeah, that's exactly how I felt. If he would have told me from the get-go, it would have been  wetter. I apologized and he apologized. I think it's swept under the rug and we can move forward now. <br/>Jeff: So Chrissy, we're almost halfway through the game. We're getting close to that point. What's the feeling? <br/>The feeling is we all believe there is a merge that is  imminent, and all four of us want to make it to the merge. Clearly that's not going to happen. <br/>Jeff: So Ali, does that influence tonight's vote? <br/>Yeah, because once we get into a merge, you need numbers. You need people you can trust going forward. Not only people that will fight for themselves but for you, as  well. <br/>Jeff: JP, that's where you have to be a little concerned,  because when you reach the merge, then it's about getting rid of contenders. <br/>Traditionally, the bigger guys or the guys that seem to do  a little better at the challenges tend to get voted off around this time. Why not get rid of JP So it's definitely a little scary to be sitting here tonight. <br/>Jeff: So what do you do? You had to think about that today with tribal coming tonight. <br/>You can say what you have to say the make you case, but at  the end of the day, it comes down the what's in everybody's best interest to  move their game forward. <br/>Jeff: Ali, JP Gave an interesting answer to a very specific question. By saying nothing. I don't see anybody else playing as laid back right now as JP What do you read into that? <br/>Yeah, he didn't say, well, I bring this and I bring this  or what he's going to offer if he does end up winning all these challenges. I have no idea what he's thinking, ever. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, surprised that JP Didn't say, let me tell you why I’m not a good person to get rid  of? <br/>No, I've known JP Since day one, and JP Plays a quiet game. <br/>Jeff: Ryan, can you appreciate why JP Would be reluctant to defend himself, because it only just  shines the light brighter on the obvious thing, he's clearly the most  physical guy here. <br/>As Chrissy said, it's a very quiet game. Sometimes that's scary, as well. If I can't have a conversation with you and I see you at the  reward challenge like basking in the imlorry, I mean, he's not missing much. There's only a couple pieces request for this guy to become a  super player. So do I want to go against that? Do I want to work with that? It's a lot of questions. <br/>Jeff: JP, I got to give you credit, because through this  entire tribal, you are like the piece of granite you appear to be carved  from. You have not proved. You are committed. So if it's you tonight, will you say, this is my game. I'm fine with it? <br/>I think if I was to walk  down that path, I probably should have been more social and open with the  game. I probably should have done that. Maybe this is a good wake-up call for me. <br/>Jeff: Ali, is this a reminder of how real it all is? <br/>Oh yeah,, it's the atmosphere being here. My body is tricking me the think I’m cold, I’m shaking. But I think it's the nervousness. I'm in a nervous position anyway because I was not included on  the last vote. I'm still hoping that what I think are mended relationships are  really mended. We'll find out where the trust lies when the vote is revealed. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, you seem to be nodding your head. <br/>It's terrible when the numbers get small because there are  no extras to vote out. With we're four great players, all of us want this so badly, so  I think that we're all just constantly evaluating right now, who do I want to  vote out. Every single person here benefits my game and hurts my game. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. JP, you're up. <br/>I got my game. You got you game. See who wins. <br/>We have to get rid of the strong. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Ali. JP One vote Ali. One vote JP Ali. That's two votes Ali, one vote JP, one vote left. Sixth person voted out...  You're kidding me. Ali, you need to bring me your torch. <br/>Good luck beating him. Wow. <br/>Jeff: Ali, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Well, you're almost out of tribe members and you are clearly  counting on a merge. Good luck. Grab you torches, head back to camp, good night. Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org  Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor," a bomb is  dropped. <br/>You are merged. [cheering and applause]  The merge, that's what you dream of. This is the playoffs now. <br/>Jeff: The target is in sight. <br/>Cole is the biggest threat. <br/>The battle line is drawn. <br/>He's going to flip on you all. <br/>I expect a war. <br/>I guess I let a little  twerp like Ryan ruin my whole game, and Chrissy is the liar of all liars. If she lies that way the rest of the game, she's going to win. I came into this game thinking I was going to play with my head,  and maybe I did use my heart a little bit. Maybe I trusted people too much. That's what got me.
