<br/>Fans. You can tell by the echo we're live. We're in los angeles live for the season finale two-hour show. Come back with me. This has been one of my favorite group of players of all time. Here they are, the millennial gen x cast. I got to say, you guys have given us a great season of game  play. It has been fun to watch, and that game play has resulted in  some devastating but thoroughly entertaining blind sides. In fact, where is... Oh, here we go. One of the best reactions after a blind side, will and Jay got  you so good you forgot your shoes. <br/>I sure did. <br/>Jeff: It was epic. This season has also had some amazing stories of growth, people  who really did transform from fearful to fearless, and that only happens when  you have the guts to take on something like "Survivor." all right. Here's what we're going to do tonight. We have the two-hour season finale. It's awesome. Then we're going to read the votes. We'll announce the winner. Then we're going to bring everybody back for the live reunion  show. So if you have a question tonight, hit me up on twitter. Yachtal Jeffprobst #"Survivor"Finale. And we'll give you a sneak peek at who will be playing next  season. All right. Cue the music, glen. Let's get to it. You've been waiting for this night all season long. The Survivor finale. You'reã§ã³ sitting at home curled in front of the couch. Six people left, three millennials, three gen x. I think it's fair to say this season any of them could win  because this game is far from over, and we have a packed house here to watch  it with us here at cbs. [cheering and applause] I’m so grateful that these tickets are  still in demand. They are ready, and I know you are. Here it is, the season finale of "Survivor"! Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. <br/>Jeff: For 35 days it has been a battle between clashing  cultures, millennialsã x. <br/>May the best generation win. <br/>Jeff: Two groups with very different approaches to life. <br/>We're young millennials.Ã§ã³ we don't care. <br/>Just build this damn thing. <br/>Jeff: It was clear this was going to be a season like no  other. They've got it! Wow. There was mother nature's fury.Ã     and risky  romance. There was raw emotion. <br/>My mom has stage four lung cancer. <br/>Jeff: And bridges built between generations. <br/>You're not the only gay guy outãI here. <br/>I owe a lot to Bret's  generation. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, the game play was intense. <br/>The vote is still very much live. <br/>Here you go, Jeff. The idol is for Ken. <br/>Jeff: Leading to an epic rock draw. Reveal. <br/>Oh, my God. Jessica.ÃI . <br/>Jeff: And a string of devastating blind sides. Only six remain. Three millennials and three gen x. Adam, this "Survivor" fan has won challenges, found an  idol and a reward steal. <br/>I’m giving you the advantage,  dude. <br/>Jeff: The only thing left to do is win for his mom. <br/>My mom told me, you can do anything you set your mind to. I set my mind to winning this game. I'm going to finalize that dream. <br/>Jeff: Jay, since the merge, he's managed to avoid the vote. Now, without an idol to protect him, he's vulnerable. Can he win his way to the end, or will he finally have his torch  snuffed? <br/>No one wants to say, I got to the six. No, you want to be like, dude, I got to the three. <br/>Jeff: Hand narcotic early in the game she suffered a panic  attack while merely watching a challenge. <br/>You're not going to let me die? <br/>Jeff: But she has mature entered a dangerous player. If she makes it to the end, will her resume be strong enough to  convince the jury? <br/>I've never been more excited or more focused, ever in my  life. Wait, is my armpit hair out? <br/>Jeff: Bret, the likable boston police sergeant. His game is focused on relationships, and he has a lot of  friends on the jury. If he can survive the last three votes, it could be worth $1  million. <br/>You're hungry, there'sãI no food in your stomach. I swear to God I’m digesting my spleen right now. Just get me to the final three where I can absolutely rip them  apart. <br/>Jeff: Ken, a single father playing for his daughter, and  with the legacy advantage in his pocket, he has at least one edge on  everything else. <br/>If you're in possession of this nolt on day 36, you will  receive an advantage in the game. <br/>Jeff: Ken has never trade from his alliance with David,  but will being loyal pay off in the end? <br/>It's all about trust and it's all about faith and it's all  about love, honestly. <br/>Jeff: David, a self-described fearful, neurotic oddball  hasã±r transformed into a strategic powerhouse. Ironically his impressive game play is now his biggest obstacle. <br/>There are 14 people missing from the game, and I’m not one  of them. And now I’m starting to think, wait a second, it's actually  possible that I might be a millionaire in a few days. <br/>Jeff: Who will have what it takes to outwit, outplay and  outlast all the rest to win the $1 million and the title of sole Survivor? <br/>The plan was to weed out the idol. That's what we did. <br/>I wasn't going to play  it. <br/>What changed? <br/>I have no idea. I really wasn't. They flushed my idol. Now they have left me barren and naked in this fricKen jungle,  fighting for myself, and it sucks. I made a fricKen dumb move. <br/>You got balls of steel for holding on to it as long as you  did. <br/>Now I have to go around this camp tomorrow and start searching  for the new one. Time to fight for the death, baby. When you have the chance to cut the throat of a snake, you do  it. <br/>For me tonight was the wrong time. What's done is done. <br/>Tribal council was horrible. It was our chance to get dave. We had him in our sights. He was obliterated. It's like... It's like the navy seals going into osama bin  laden's house, walking up, got the guns out, they got him in their sighteds  and txe? Say, you know what, let's go grab some coffee. We'll give him another day. We'll come back tomorrow. You got him in your sights. You're there. You take him out. But David, he is dangerous. <br/>Okay. <br/>And he should have gone tonight. <br/>Okay. <br/>Because we still have Jay we have to worry about. <br/>That's your opinion. My opinion is different. <br/>I’m working with complete  morons. Jay and dave are going to win this thing. We have to vote them out.ÃI  I somehow escaped another  we have to vote them out.ÃI  I somehow escaped another  vote, but I have a huge target on my back right now, and I’m like trying to  figure out, you know, where are the knives going to come from, like who is  coming after me? I have to do everything I can to survive, so I need to create a  little chaos.Ã§ã³ I have been stealing all of these beads and shells for a  while now. I've been taking them off of tribal torches. I've been taking them off of water bottles. I've been taking them off of tree mail. I wanted to have a lot of options. We're getting toward the end. I'm assuming that there are no idols left in this game, but a  fake immunity idol could really messed up someone's game. We are barreling toward the end of this game, and I've got to do  everything I can to make sure that I end up in the final three. If I have to do dirty tricks like this, then so be it, and  hopefully by tomorrow morning I'll have caught a fish. Hopefully by tomorrow morning I'll have caught a fish. <br/>I need to find this fricKen  idol, man. I need a delivery from an angel to swing by and, boop, here you  go. Then I hear, "Jay, Jay." then I’m like, I need to get  some coconuts or this will look really suspicious. <br/>You got something? <br/>Coconut, coconut, coconut. <br/>It's one of my favorite things. <br/>I have Ken and David  behind me talking whatever nonsense. All I’m doing is focusing. I'm looking, I’m looking, I’m looking, e-mail looking and, boop,  I see a pink it little cir that was on a little coconut. Oh, my God, dude. Oh, my God. I think he may have seen it. If I’m right I caught the fish that I wanted to catch. Luckily these two fools didn't look down and they just kept  talking about coconuts while your boy Jay's got his eyes on the prize, which  is the golden coconut. <br/>Oh, boy. <br/>Take me out of the game, bitches. Thank you. Bastards. Last night at tribal council, they made me flush my idol, my  safety net. But guess what? Whoopsie, there's another one. No one saw the fricKen idol. I have a train of losers following me into the camp. How stupid they didn't see it. You can't take the pirate out of this game. Let's fricKen do this. I'm going for a million bucks. <br/>I’m tired. I'm hungry. But day 36 is a damn good day in my world. Today I get to open up the legacy advantage and see what it has  in store for me. This is for you, kiddo. Congratulations. You are the beneficiary of the legacy advantage. This note guarantees you immunity at the next tribal council. This game is upside down right now, and you never feel safe,  especially when there's six people left. The legacy advantage guarantees me another step in this game. This is big, beyond big, and I have to be smart about it. So no one's going to know about this until tonight at tribal  council. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I’m in. <br/>Jeff: Ken, I got to take it back. Thank you. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going the race through a series of  obstacles while collecting a bag of tiles. You'll use the numbers inside to solve a combination lock. That will release a key. You'll cover your numbers, go under a net, up a wall, and use  the key to unlock a set of puzzle pieces. You'll then race to assemble a puzzle. First to finish wins immunity, guaranteed a one in five shot at  winning this game. Losers tribal council where somebody will become the eighth  member of our jury. In addition, the first to finish wins reward. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh. <br/>Jeff: Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: The first to finish will get a big, juicy steak  waiting for you back at camp with all the fixings. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: We're going to draw for spots. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. For immoneyty and reward -- immunity and reward, Survivors  ready? Go! Attack that wall. Ken and Jay over first. Then Bret, Hannah, David and 36 days. Whatever's in the tank, you need it now. Jay has his bag of tiles. He's through first. Ken right behind. It is Jay and Ken. Here goes Hannah now. Now you've got to untie the tiles and use the three pairs of  numbers to solve the combination lock. Everybody now working on those tiles. There are six possible combinations. <br/>Come on, come on. <br/>Jeff: Jay has his tiles out of the bag. He's got them unknotted. Jay can start working. Ken is trying to untie his tielts. David has his out. He's untying them. Jay tries one combo. It's not right. Jay going to give it another go and he's got it right this time. Releases his key. Jay in the lead now. But he did not cover it up. David takes advantage of it. Ken's got it figured out. Everybody is now looking. It is chaos. Big error by Jay. He's got a cover he could have used and he didn't. That opens the door for everybody else to catch up. It is Jay racing to the top. Start working on his puzzle. Ken right behind. David now going to use the numbers to release the key. And it's in the right. He didn't do something right. There goes Bret. David coming back for another look. Here goes Hannah now. So fatigued that even when he can read the numbers, it is hard  to solve it. David goes back for a third look. Simple memory now is proving difficult. David has his key. It is now Adam in dead last. He's got his key. You've got to attack this last wall. That's how you do it. Everybody working on that puzzle. <br/>Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. <br/>Jeff: Jay had a big lead and he gave it all up by not  covering that combination. Will it come back the haunt him because now everybody is working  on their puzzle. <br/>Come on. <br/>Jeff: Hannah trying to figure out how these two first  pieces hang together. It is Jay in the lead right now. Everybody else trying the catch him. Now it's going to come down to how much of that diminished brain  capacity can you muster right now to try to figure out a very complicated  puzzle. <br/>Dammit. Dammit. Dammit. Dammit. <br/>Jeff: Jay with another piece. Hannah looking next door for some kind of clue. David is back in this. And opening the door, Jay let five other people catch him. It could be a catastrophic, $1 million mistake. <br/>You had the lead, you bozo. <br/>Jeff: Bret now making some progress. David with another piece. Adam now looking at David's puzzle trying to get some help. Bret now looking at David. David with another piece. <br/>Get in there. <br/>Jeff: Jay trying to get back in this now. He's had a big lead. David has caught him.Ã§ã³ David and Jay battling for immunity. Who will get there first? <br/>There it is. <br/>Jeff: David with another piece. Jay getting closer. But something is not right. <br/>Jeff! <br/>Jeff: David down to his last piece. Jay almost there. Jay loses everything. <br/>Jeff! <br/>Jeff: David thinks he has it. David wins individual immunity and reward in the form of a steak  dinner. <br/>Thanks, man. Thank you. <br/>So close! <br/>Jeff: David, come on over. <br/>Good job, dave. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, guys. <br/>Jeff: Congratulations. David, safe tonight at tribal council, guaranteed a 1-5 shot at  winning this game. In addition, you've justãI earne a giant steak reward back at  camp. Here's your dilemma. You can choose two of the remaining five to join you, which  means...  Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Jay. Congratulations, you have found an advantage that allows you to  steal an award after it hasãI be won by someone else. <br/>Jeff: So, Jay, that means you are taking over the reward? <br/>Yeah. But I’m going to eat with David. He won. He beat me. But I’m picking somebody else. <br/>Jeff: So you come over here. <br/>Thanks, Jay. <br/>Jeff:  I don't play like that. <br/>Jeff: So you're now in charge of the reward. Who are you going to choose? <br/>The person who gave me this because he won it fairly. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: Big political decision. David, Jay, Adam, big steak dinner waiting for you back at camp. Hannah, Ken and Bret, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. Enjoy the afternoon, congrats. <br/>Thanks a lot. <br/>I fricking blew it. I was so close to making final four for sure. Now I have to take Adam and David and sit them down and save  myself. The game is not over until they say the game is over. <br/>Wow. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Look at that. <br/>Wow. <br/>Sit down, boys. Let's eat. <br/>Yeah, yeah, I love it. Let's have a toast. <br/>Thank you for getting me here. <br/>Thank you both. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Tonight I’m going to tribal council. The rewards are important because if you pick the people  correctly, you could change your fate. You can make moves. If there is way the sway David and Adam to vote Bret, I can save  my idol tonight so that tomorrow I can sit back, relax and just go, boop, I don't  need to do anything. <br/>Considering, David, you are the biggest threat in a lot of  people's eyes, I am also a huge threat, and if you get rid of both me and  you, Adam, you're up next. <br/>I’m the perfect shield  the take. They're going to take me out before they take either of you out. <br/>What if you keep winning? <br/>If I keep winning, what do you want me to say? I'll take you both? Because I'll do it. <br/>I will take you both, and  if Bret wins tomorrow, I guarantee that he's not taking you two. <br/>Well, he hates me. <br/>He told me that he wants you out, and, Bret, he's got  every friend on that jury. <br/>Oh, he does, he does. Other than Ken, not a lot of people are running up to me and  telling me they want to takeã±r m to final three. Jay is not only offering final three, but also serves as a  shield for myself. That's incredibly tempting, because once Jay is gone,  everybody's going to be looking at me. <br/>Thank you for taking me here, and it did not fall on deaf  ears. <br/>So it should be pretty simple tonight then. <br/>Especially Jay on a full belly of protein and food. <br/>Oh, yeah, we're screwed. He's got to go tonight. It doesn't matter, just write his name down. <br/>You can't ever let your guard down. I have to wonder was Jay able to swing anybody to his side. <br/>They would be a fool to keep him in the game. <br/>Is there any chance he has an idol. <br/>You have to stop thinking like that. Jay is going home, easy, easy, easy 5-1 vote. <br/>We were just talking about you. <br/>So this was Jay's last supper on the beach. My chances to get to the final three are looking better and  better every day. <br/>I'd be happy to write down Bret. He already wants me out of the fricking game like hard core. <br/>Plus he has friends and he hasn't killed anyone. <br/>Bret is definitely a threat, but this is an opportunity to  finally take out Jay. He could very well win two more individual immunity challenges  and end up in the final three and win this game. <br/>We need to go down to the final four by leaving Bret, who  has never won a challenge, and probably can't to save his life, in the game  with the final five. <br/>Well, I tell you this, he will win at three. He's the most likable guy in this game. <br/>That's true. That is actually true. That's fair. Bret is as much a threat as anyone else. <br/>It's Jay. Jay has to go tonight. <br/>You have an idol? <br/>I wish I did. <br/>I'd play it right now, buddy. Trust me, if I had it...  What was your pitch? <br/>That you were a bigger threat. There you have it. <br/>It should be simple. But you're dealing with crazy people. <br/>Can David and I talk to you real quick? <br/>What could they possibly want the talk to him about? This is what I’m dealing with. The crazies could send me home and cost me and themselves $1  million. Dopes. <br/>So we just wanted to come to you and say where we're at. David is down. <br/>David, thank you. <br/>I’m a consistent maybe  right now. But Adam is like no. <br/>Yes, maybe, no? <br/>Yeah. <br/>If Adam was on board, would you be on board? <br/>I'll talk to Adam. I need the talk to Adam. Hannah and David are willing to move forward, but I need to get Adam  on board. You got to be persistent. You have to keep implanting things in people's heads. But even if these fools don't want to flip, I have my idol and I  can take out whoever I want. <br/>If you can just give me one fricking chance, man, one  shot, and take me out tomorrow. Even if I win tomorrow, and then I win the four, I’m taking you. <br/>I know you are. <br/>It's a guarantee. David's in. I flipped David. Come on, Adam. <br/>We're brothers. For life. <br/>You'll give me a shot? <br/>Yeah. <br/>All right. <br/>Tonight is a very tough decision. I could save Jay. We share this weird relationship where we're bitter rivals, but  we also have grown into this brotherly love, and I genuinely believe that Jay  wants to take me to the end. He's promised me final three. The question is: Could I beat him? The question is: Could I beat him? <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Michelle, Taylor, Chris, Jessica, Zeke, will, and Sunday voted  out at the last tribal council. All right. David, you win immunity and reward. Then Jay says, I’m going to steal it. Walk me through that, Jay. <br/>I've been on the bottom for weeks, so considering that, I said  my pitch to the boys and I tried to scramble my way out of this one. <br/>Jeff: So Adam, was lunch a working lunch, as well? <br/>Yeah, absolutely. Jay is never going to give up, and a reward is a great  opportunity to sit down and say, what if the three of us work together. <br/>Jeff: Bret, you had to know that was coming. <br/>Yeah, I’m in a tough spot, because if it's not him going,  it's me. So I was hoping they weren't buying whatever he was selling, and  I hate to say it because we've worked together in the past, but he is a  threat. <br/>But honestly, Jeff, those are all of Brets friends. <br/>He sees some of my friends. I see a lot of his friend, as well. <br/>I wish. <br/>Jeff: Hannah, it's tricky, because if you take the wrong people  to the end, you could be giving away $1 million. <br/>Yeah, you could end up having no chance because you didn't  read the jury right. So there's a lot at play. <br/>Jeff: Jay, the other big moment at the challenge, it is  designed to give you a cover to hide the combination. <br/>All I had to do was just lift the cover and I would be  sitting here looking like a champion, but now I’m sitting here in sweats as  usual. <br/>The thing is day six you remember to grab that cover and  pull it over. Day 36 it's a lot more difficult. <br/>Jeff: David, Ken bricks up an interesting point. You guys had a pretty decent meal. Tomorrow there could be another immunity challenge, and, man,  when you are clear headed, that's a massive advantage. <br/>Yes, absolutely. I feel like I could beat you in an arm wrestling match right  now. <br/>My money is on Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Ken, how much talk is there of idols and whether  there are any still in the game and if so will they get played? <br/>Anything in this game is possible, but the only way you're  going to find it is if you sneak away without anybody knowing. Someone gets up and stirs in the middle of the night, you're  hearing it. <br/>Jeff: Hand narcotic what's your take on tonight's vote. <br/>We have six people sitting up here, so every vote is a  huge decision. Every vote has a purpose. Whether or not that purpose is clear right away. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Bret, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now would be the time to do so. Jeff? I'm not going home. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>You guys can chase me, but you got to be quicker than  that. <br/>Wow. <br/>Unbelievable. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: This is... Not a hidden immunity idol. It is a work of art, but it has no value in this game. <br/>Oh, my God. Dude, you freaking got me, you bastards. Any votes cast for Jay will count. <br/>Jeff, can I give something to you? <br/>Jeff: Yes. <br/>Thank you. <br/>What? <br/>No way. <br/>This is called the legacy advantage. If day 36 hits and you have this in your pocket, it counts as an  automatic individual immunity. <br/>Whoa. <br/>Jeff: This is a legacy advantage. Any votes cast for Ken tonight will not count. <br/>What? <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: I'll read the votes. <br/>I hate this game. <br/>Jeff: First vote, Ken. Will not count. Jay. That's one vote Jay. Jay. Two votes Jay. 15th person voted out, eighth member of our jury --  Damn. You got me. I hate all of you. <br/>To the very end, dude. To the very end. <br/>I had fun, though. <br/>Jeff: Jay. <br/>You're all warriors. It was mad fun. <br/>You, too Jay. <br/>Bye. <br/>Jeff: Go ahead, Jeffrey.ÃI snap my door shut. <br/>Jeff: Jay, the tribe has spoKen. Time for you to go. <br/>Well done. <br/>See you, bud. <br/>$1 million lock combination. <br/>The legacy advantage. <br/>Jeff: And now we're down the five. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Oh, man. You got me. You got me. That sucks to go out. Oh, I tried my best, begging, pleading, fighting, scrambling. I had a lot of fun. It was a great experience. Much love for everyone. [applause]  Jeff: Well, I know there were a lot of people that hated  to see Jay go, but that really captures the level of game play that we've  seen all season. David and Jay both playing aggressively. Sometimes it works. Sometimes you get burned. But to get far in "Survivor," you have to be willing  the take the risk. It's also a bit of a tease for what we're doing next season. "Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen x" continues after this. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. <br/>I am extraordinarily  worried that Jay is gone because he was my shield. I think now I’m the biggest target. <br/>That's intense. <br/>So I feel like I’m going to be voted out next if I do not  win today's immunity challenge. I just wish it wasn't a swimming challenge. <br/>Jeff: Guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First things first, David. I have to take it back. <br/>Why did have it to be water, Jeff? <br/>Jeff: Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to maneuver a buoy through a  series of obstacles. You'll then use two handles to transport puzzle pieces across a  teeter totter. Once you have all the pieces, you'll use them to solve a word  puzzle. First to finish wins immunity, guaranteed a spot in the final  four. Losers go the tribal council where somebody will join the jury. Draw for spots. You'll get started.Ã§ã³ all right. Here we go. For immunity, guaranteed spot in the final four, Survivors  ready? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Go! David in the water first. Then Bret. Ken now in the water. There goes Adam and Hannah. Now it's how quickly you can move in the water with that buoy. David's there. Bret is there. Ken is there. Adam right there. It is now David in the lead. Ken is on the platform now. It is Ken now first in the water. Then Bret. And then David. David now in the water. Adam's in theãI water. The water has not been David's friend for 37 days, and it is  challenging him again. It is Ken working nicely with the buoy. Hannah finally in the water in dead last. Ken is free now. He's making his way up the beach. Bret is now through. Start untying those puzzle pieces. Adam is through. David's now through. Pick up those leg, David. Ken has all his letter tiles out. He's taking a lot at once. Here comes Hannah. She's still fighting to stay in it. Ken heading over the teeter totter. Ken takes a lot of tiles at once and drops them all. This is where it gets challenging. Now how many can you take at once. Bret now going to head over with just a few. Bret doing a nice job. Bret is up. Bret has his first tile. Bret now in the lead. Ken going to give it a go again. This time with much fewer tiles. Struggling to hold on. He can't do it. Ken drops again. Ken's got to go back. Bret now taking another small group of tiles. Adam now on the beam. Bret's good. David now on the teeter totter. David a nice save. Adam, you're good. Head back. Here comes Ken trying again. This time he's got it. David struggling to hang on. They are barely there. Can he get to the table? He does. Head back, David. Hannah's now on the teeter totter.Ã§ã³ Hannah drops. Got to go back. Here comes Ken. Ken now starting to get some momentum. Took him a whileãI to figure it out.Ã Adam with more tiles. A nice save. Bret heading back with his last tiles. Huge lead for Bret right now. He can start working on that word puzzle. Here comes Ken with his last tiles. Ken, start working on the puzzle. Adam, you're good. David, you're good. Everybody is now working on the word puzzle except Hannah. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Jeff: Like any good "Survivor" puzzle, there are  several words that will work, but only one phrase that is right. You must have immunity tonight to feel safe. Hannah coming back over with her last tiles. Hannah now working on the word puzzle. Who will be safe tonight at tribal? Anything is possible with a word puzzle. Ly not tell you if anybody is making progress. You will not know if you are ahead oar behind. You will only know when you have it. What is it? People new starting to move pieces around. <br/>Jeff, Jeff, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Ken thinks he has it. Say it. <br/>Not a participation trophy. <br/>Jeff: It is definitely not a participation trophy. Ken wins individual immunity, guaranteed a spot in the final  four. <br/>My God, how did I miss that. <br/>It was so easy. I don't know how I didn't get that. <br/>Jeff: Ken, come on over. <br/>Good job, Ken. <br/>Thanks, guys. <br/>Jeff: Third individual immunity win. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Jeff:ãI once again Ken safe from the vote, will live to  see day 38, make it to the final four. As for the rest of you, I knowãI it has been a tough 37 days. High level of game play for one of you. This is where it ends.ÃI grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>I am very nervous that it  could be me tonight, but I’m extremely happy because I didn't want dave to  win, and I’m hoping dave goes home, but I don't want to get ahead of myself,  because there are crazy people involved in this vote. Any time you get crazies involved, anything could happen. <br/>Nice job, Ken, man. I wanted that one, I’m not going to lie. <br/>I know. We all did. <br/>You did a great job. I'm usually a very humble winner. <br/>No, that's a big one. <br/>New york I would have screamed, too. <br/>I was this close to  having a guaranteed ticket to the final four, and I dropped the ball. But the fact that dave didn't win is huge for my game, because I  need dave to go home tonight. More important than strategizing with people this afternoon is  making sure that if there is an idol out here, it doesn't end up in dave's  pocket. I know that Bret is on my side, and I know that Hannah is on my  side, but an idol can screw everything up. Dave is an incredible guy. But it's why he needs to go, because he would win this game. I'm terrified that if this thing isn't out there, it probably  means that dave already has it. <br/>Where is everybody? <br/>Bret's sitting over there, and I don't know where Adam's  at. <br/>Can I pitch something to you guys? <br/>Yeah. <br/>How do you guys feel about voting out Adam? <br/>Wow. That's a new name. What's the pitch against Adam versus Bret? <br/>Well, Bret's got to go, two, but we're final three, right? <br/>Yeah. So they both have to go, so in a way the order doesn't matter. Adam has a better chance of winning immunity tomorrow, and  he'sãI probably targeting me any how. So unless you guys are thinking about voting out me. <br/>I’m not. If this is the three, let's just do it. <br/>Tonight's tribal is absolutely a battle between me and Adam. I need to get rid of him before he gets rid of me. It's the last night that anybody can play an idol should they  have one. I just have serious doubts about whether one even exists, so for  this vote, it has to be Adam. <br/>Where is Adam? <br/>He said he was having stomach issues. <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, God. How about two idols for you, mom. How does that sound? Finding one and knowing how proud my mom was going to be ofã  that was such a feeling of joy that I haven't had for seven months outside of  this game since my mom was diagnosed. It's been an absolute nightmare, so to have some feeling of joy  here and to know that my mom is going to share that and get to do it twice,  that's the best. You can't ask for anything betterãI than that. <br/>Final four. <br/>How you feeling, brã¡uã±  I’m not feeling good. <br/>Well, would you be willing to write down Adam's name? <br/>I'd be willing to do anything that would keep me to the  final four. <br/>Okay. <br/>Does that helpoi  It does help. It helps a lot. <br/>I’m in. <br/>I know everybody wants me  out, but it's the right move. <br/>Okay. <br/>I come back thinking I’m next  on the chopping block, but my name is not even in this and tomorrow is final  four. You know what I mean? It's Adam and dave, these two are in a fight against each other. So I’m letting dave think I’m with him and I’m voting Adam. I'm playing it cool. But tonight's vote is about taking out the biggest threat of the  game, who is dave. <br/>Is Hannah on their side or is she with us? <br/>She's with us. <br/>It doesn't matter? <br/>Whose is that? <br/>Mine. You're not going home. That means he doesn't have it. <br/>I could not have found  this idol at a better moment. Because this is when I need it. Dave and Ken decided to gun for me at the exact moment where I got  safety for myself. So if anything they're going to look stupid. I have total power over tonight's vote. <br/>Anything new? <br/>You know he's coming after you. <br/>Yeah, not Bret, right? <br/>No. <br/>But actually me? <br/>You. <br/>The best revenge, I'll cancel my votes and you'll win. <br/>Do you have an idol? <br/>I found it. <br/>Dude, I love you. And this guy you'll get the use it correctly. <br/>Basically I've been playing both sides like I do. Adam brags to me, he goes, I have an idol. Vote out David. There's some sort of arrogance that lines some of these boys to  not seeing what I can do to them. The men don't have the power at this tribal. <br/>Oh, my God. I'm so excited. <br/>Being in the middle is where the power lies. I could vote David out of the game tonight. <br/>We're going to get the guy who can beat us all in the end  out of this game. <br/>Right. <br/>I could go to David and  tell him we have to switch the vote to Bret. Can I ask a dumb question? <br/>Is there more a risk Adam has an idol? <br/>I don't think there is an  idol. <br/>My choice tonight is about both who I think I can beat at  the end and who I can trust to get me to the end. <br/>I can't wait for tonight. <br/>All the boys have opinion, but at the end of the day, I want  a lady to make the choice. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Michelle, Taylor, Chris, Jessica, Zeke, will, Sunday, and Jay  voted out at the last tribal council. All right. So another important challenge. Ken, you pull out your third individual win. You go back to camp. Hannah, how long before people scurry into the jungle. <br/>Not very long, because people both want to have  conversations and people want the look for idols some the playing is not  stopping with this group of people. <br/>Jeff: Adam, are you part of the idol hunt? <br/>I think I was the first  person to take off, yeah. <br/>Jeff: David, we often talk about "Survivor" is  this marathon of sprints. Where are we in the game right now? <br/>Yeah, I think each of us has been imagining different  final threes. Who are the two best people that you should be sitting next to. <br/>Jeff: Bret, David's making the pitch that it doesn't  matter if you're the best player. It only matters that you're perceived as the best of who is  left. <br/>I’m not thinking to the  final three. I'm just trying to get to tomorrow, and I'll think about  tomorrow tomorrow. <br/>Jeff: Hannah, is it at all possible that Bret has not  considered final three combinations? <br/>I think he's definitely  thought about the final three, but I think he's thinking about how he gets  there. And I think we all are. <br/>Jeff: Hannah, who are the biggest threats? <br/>We've heard it over and over, David is a threat. I don't think it's a secret. <br/>Jeff: Bret...  David is a threat. <br/>And I think Bret would be very hard to sit next to. <br/>Jeff: So, David, if I could female your pulse, is it, duh,  duh, duh, duh. <br/>I think I could be going  home, but what are you to do other than trust the people you trust and rely  on their loyalty and hope that really does mean something. <br/>Jeff: If it is you tonight, what is the end of this story? <br/>While I really, really, really really want to be sole Survivor,  if I can take what I've learned from this game, like greater confidence, then  apply it to my real life, then even if I lose I think I've won. <br/>That's why he's such a huge threat. He has such a beautiful story. On day one he was scared of birds. <br/>They did chase me. <br/>And now he's won individual immunity a couple time, has  made people smile, has made people laugh, has made people cry. <br/>Who did I make cry? <br/>You made me cry. <br/>Oh. <br/>You always cry. <br/>Jeff: Bret, how much pressure is there knowing, I am  legitimately close to having a real shot at that money? <br/>You know, at first it's like, it's marathon, you're trying  to get there, you're trying to get there. Then you wake up and you're like, oh, my God, I've worked so  hard to get to day 36. Now tomorrow is day 37 and I got through there. You just don't want it to end. If it's me, I’m going to be devastated. <br/>Jeff: Hannah, the last woman standing. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: The youngest person left in this game. Are you nervous about tonight's vote? <br/>Yeah, I’m always nervous about the vote. You know, the numbers are getting smaller and everyone feels  like they have a game plan, and for some of us, we're wrong. <br/>Jeff: All right. It's time to find out who is going home. Adam, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. <br/>Jeff. I would really, really, really like to get to the final four. I think a few bullets might even by coming my way tonight, thank  you very much. <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Adam will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote, David. Bret. One vet David, one vote Bret. Two votes David, one vote Bret. Bret. We're tied. Two votes David. Two votes Bret. One vote left. 16th person voted out and the ninth member of our jury, Bret. <br/>The flip of flips again. <br/>Jeff: Bret, the tribe has spoKen. <br/>David, congratulations. The rest of you, you just lost $1 million. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Well, there is only one reason you would continue to  blindside each other, and that has to believe because all of you believe  every person here is a legitimate threat to win this game. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Going out like this sucks. If those were two people that had some sort of a brain, they  would have learned that David is going to eat them alive an they would have  voted them out tonight, but I will say, this is a great game. It brought me out of michele finally. How lucky am I to have actually have been part of "Survivor"  after being fan for so many years? I didn't realize loyalty ran so deep in this game. I'm impressed, honestly. I'm blown away by tonight. <br/>I’m losing my mind  thinking about it. Ken and Hannah saved me. <br/>Think about all the people over there that either look at Bret  as the big uncle, the best friend. <br/>I recognize that. I also recognize that he is a lot less likely to win a challenge  than David is. You have become a physical threat. <br/>I should not be standing  here talking, but yet here I stand. <br/>I cannot imagine what you  will possibly say that will make me think that you didn't make a huge mistake  tonight. <br/>There was no possible path with dave gone. If I had turned on Ken, Ken would have been so mad at me, and so  I thought it was better to take a really big gamble. I get that David is a gigantic threat to to win. <br/>Ken is the most likely person to win at the final four. If he win, all he talks about is loyalty and trust, and you know  he has a final three with dave. Oh, my God, what? I'm so blown away by what happened tonight. We just put dave, the biggest threat in the game, one challenge  away from the final tribal council. We have to win tomorrow. <br/>I know. <br/>We have to win. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. You guys ready to get to your final immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes, we are. <br/>Jeff: Ken, I got to take it back. <br/>Thank you for this. <br/>Jeff: Thank you. For the last time immonti back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to use a long pole to  maneuver a bowl through a channel. When you get to the top, you'll place the bowl, head back for  your next one. The entire structure sits on a spring, which means if you hit it  too hard, it wobbles, your bowls drop, you got to start over. First person to stack 13 bowls or the person with the most bowls  at the end of 30 minutes wins immunity, guaranteed a spot at that final  tribal council. Biggest stakes so far. Draw for spots. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. Last shot for a guaranteed spot at the final tribal council. Survivors ready? Go! All the models right here. Ken is out now Hannah now David. Everyone making their way through that first channel. It's easy at first. Stay on your own pace. <br/>Oh, geez. <br/>Jeff: Adam drops. He's got to go all the way back. David places his first. Ken places his first. Hannah still working on her first. Adam still working on his first. There's Hannah with her first. David back with his second. There are 13 total. If nobody gets to 13 by 3 minutes, -- by 30 minutes, whoever has  the tallest stack wins. Whoever has the tallest stack wins. It is Adam in the lead with ten. Hannah places her tenth. Ken places his tenth and we are tied, except David with eight. David hits his structure and loses everything. Ken has his 11th bowl. Ken is in the lead over Adam. Hannah loses everything. All this work gone. It is now Ken with 11, Adam with with ten. Wind is blowing. <br/>Nice and steady, Ken! <br/>Jeff: Ken is going for number 12 while Adam just watching. Adam now stepping off his platform hoping that wind is going to  knock Ken's stack over. Ken has one bowl left. Adam's strategy worked. Ken lost everything. It is now Adam in the lead. <br/>No, no, no! Adam loses everything and we're back starting over again. This is proof once again why you never ever give up in this  game. David working that fourth. David drops again. It's now Hannah in the lead while Adam and Ken racing to get  back in this. Nothing about this challenge is easy. Just under two minutes left in this challenge. Hannah in the lead as she places her tenth. Ken trying the catch her with his tenth. David now working on his sixth and Adam is sitting on eight. Adam just watching once again, taking the defensive position in  this game to let somebody else mess up. Here comes Ken with his tenth. Hannah is just hanging out. David world on his seventh, and just like that David loses  everything again. Less than one minute left. Everybody waiting now. This is a game of chicKen. Who is going to move first, what's the wind going to do. Meanwhile, David is racing to get back in it. He's got nothing to lose. Time? <br/>Jeff: 30 seconds. Ken going to place his tenth, attempting to tie Hannah. Adam hoping in these last few seconds something happens. Ken going to go for 11. There are 15 seconds left. Adam will only win if both Hannah and Ken drop. Ken going for it. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one...  That is it. We are tied 10-10. We will have a showdown between Hannah and Ken. What a challenge. All right. Here we go. It is a five-minute showdown. Here are the rulings. At the end of five minutes whoever has the most bowls stacked  wins. If you get to 13, you win. This is it, spot at the final three. Good luck to you both. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Jeff: Survivors ready? Go! Everybody knows how this plays now. Ken out of the gate very aggressive. Hannah back to her same strategy of slow and steady. The only difference this time is you only have five minutes. You're not going for half hour, so that may play to the  advantage of being more aggressive. Ken has his first. Hannah staying true to her form, going very slow. Going to let Ken either win or lose based on how aggressively  he's playing. Hannah has her first. Ken working on his second. Ken in the lead. 38 days comes down to a five-minute showdown, a do-ordie or  potentially go home tonight at tribal where you become the 10th member of the  jury. Hannah with her second bowl. Ken with three. Hannah with two. Ken still in the lead. Hannah now picking up the pace. Here comes the wind. Ken now has the wait. It is too risky to try to place a bowl on that stack, which  opens the door for Hannah with her fourth. We are tied now 4-4. Ken going to try the place his fifth. It is touchy. <br/>Slow, Ken, slow. <br/>Jeff: Ken places his fifth. Ken back in the lead. Here's Hannah with her fifth. And we are down to one minute left in this challenge. Hannah has her fifth. Ken working on his sixth. <br/>Good job, Ken. <br/>Jeff: Hannah racing back for her sixth. Can she catch Ken? 45 seconds left. We are tied at five. Ken through the maze with his sixth. Hannah right behind with her sixth. <br/>Take your time. <br/>Jeff: 30 seconds left. As Ken places his sixth, Hannah working on her sixth. This is it. Hannah places her sixth. Going for her seventh. Ken working on his seventh. <br/>Get it on there. <br/>Jeff: Ten seconds left. We'll go to another showdown if Ken can't get. There we are tied 6-6. <br/>Careful. <br/>Jeff: Five, four, three, two, one. Ken places his seventh and Ken wins his fourth individual  immunity, guaranteed a spot at the final tribal council in an epic finish to  this season. <br/>Whew. <br/>Jeff: Huge effort. That was down to the last seconds. <br/>You did it, buddy. <br/>Awesome job. <br/>Jeff: Ken, come on over. <br/>Good boy, Ken. <br/>Jeff: For the fourth time immunity is yours, and most  importantly, you've gone as far as you can go in this game. You will be at that final tribal council. One big decision left tonight, who will be that tenth and final  member of the jury? One thing we know, it will not be you? After 38 days, David, Hannah, Adam, for somebody your dream will  fall one day short. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>Four times after the merge I was able to walk away with  this necklace here, and I’m in. I'm one of the three. Now who do I want to sit by? It's going to be theabsolute toughest decision. <br/>Congratulations, Ken. <br/>Final three. Unbelievable. <br/>Nicely done. <br/>The immunity challenge didn't go as well as I had hoped,  but I’m happy about the fact that Ken won, because I have such faith in Ken's  loyalty and trust toward me, and if it really is real, worst-case scenario I go  to a fire-making challenge against Adam, which I've gotten pretty good at. <br/>No matter what I’m writing dave's name down tonight and  you too? <br/>100%. Let me deal with Ken, okay? I know. I know. <br/>My idea at tribal last night was to set up the kill for David,  but tonight we need to convince Ken to vote out David or else it goes to a  fire-making challenge against the guy who has been making fire this entire  time. Bret called me a flip-flopper last night, but since the merge  there is one person I have never flipped on or never considered flipping on. <br/>Me. <br/>Yeah, I think I've been one of the more loyal players. That's why they all think I’m an idiot. <br/>They think I’m an idiot, too. I believe in trust look where it's gotten us. <br/>Can I say something to you? If you take dave, we all lose. <br/>But of all the people we met in this game, I’m closest to  dave. We bonded literally on day one. Hannah's pitch is if we take David to the final three, we lose. I understand where she's coming from. David has played a hell of a game, but my whole game has been  based on loyalty and friendship. From day one I've been saying, me and dave, to the end. <br/>Just trust me, please have trust in me, have faith in me. <br/>That you are smart and capable and I shouldn't  underestimate you. <br/>It's so frustrating because Ken works by a different code. He's all about trust and honor. Even when it's not the smartest game move. <br/>I have never met anyone  like Ken. We had a final three agreement on like day three, and so it  would make more sense for you and Hannah to go after each other than it would  to go after me. <br/>Not at all. I'm sorry that I was rooting against you so hard at the immunity  challenge, but I basically gave up my shot at immunity just to make sure that  you didn't win. If they don't vote you out, I lose the game. So what does it matter? So I end up in third place over fourth. I'm in the here for that. <br/>Yeah. <br/>The only way I have any kind of chance whatsoever is if  you go home. That's it. Dave and I both know that we're voting for the other person. It's entirely clear, and, you know, playing around it would just  be pointless at this point. Meanwhile, Hannah's out in the water right now with Ken hopefully  trying to convince him to vote out dave tonight, but if that doesn't work,  then I need my plan "B," which is attempting to beat dave in a  fire-making challenge. I'm practicing making fire with a machete, with flint, because I  know if the votes are tied tonight, that's what I’m going to be doing. It's entirely possible. <br/>I’m so nervous. I shouldn't be because tonight should be a no-brainer. It really should. But not with these people. <br/>Well, I'll tell you this, man, I trust you 100%, so I don't  want to make any hard sell to you because I don't think I have to. Obviously I’m going to write down Adam's name. That's what I’m doing. And if you vote Adam, it will be a tie. Then I have to worry about making fire. Obviously my faith rests entirely in your hands, but, I just  trust you. That's it. <br/>We're good. <br/>Yeah. Thanks a lot. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>So tonight I can vote out my closest friend, or I can vote  against Adam and then he and David will have a fire challenge against one  another, and let them fight and fight like men and see who comes out on top. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Michelle, Taylor, Chris, Jessica, Zeke, will, Sunday, Jay, and Bret  voted out at the last tribal council. The penultimate tribal council. Not the, last but it might be the most important. Who will go to the final tribal council and who will become the  final member of the jury? So let's start with one of the most dramatic challenges I've  ever seen. Hannah, I remember the first time you voted. It took you so long I thought you got lost. <br/>Yeah. And the thing with with the challenge today, too...  Jeff: Hold on. I'm not done paying you a compliment. <br/>Okay, Jeff probst. <br/>Jeff: Now when you vote you march with authority. <br/>You're the woman who had a pan attack while watching a  challenge. <br/>Yeah, I did, yeah. <br/>Jeff: And here you are nearly taking out Ken. It was crushing to be defeated that way, but we fought it out. <br/>Jeff: Adam, when it came down to sudden death, you can't  do anything except watch. <br/>I actually put myself in  that position today, Jeff. My only goal today was to make sure dave didn't win immunity. <br/>Jeff: Wow. David? <br/>Jeff: Adam is a very strategic player, but he recognizes  throughout the last 38 days I've played a better game than he has. <br/>I’m glad he admits it. So many people have been right here saying dave is the biggest  threat in the game because he's been up here the whole time, and people have  been shooting and missing just underneath. <br/>Up here. I'm sorry. Way, way up here. <br/>Jeff: So Ken, you are the only one right now certain that  you'll be here tomorrow night.Ã§ã³  Yeah. <br/>Jeff: So today you had to be the man of the hour. <br/>Yeah, today immediately it was, can I talk to you? Can I talk to you? I immediately said, I still need to be me. I'm going to go out and fish. I'm happy to hear what you've got to say, but I’m not going to  change just because I’m wearing this necklace. <br/>Jeff: All right. The math is pretty simple. Can't vote for Ken. David, what was your pitch? <br/>Well, I made a final-three deal with Ken on day three or  four, and here we are about to go into final three, and the thing is, Ken has  brought a depth of trust and loyalty, honor and integrity like no other Survivor  ever. Those things are extinct in this game. And I don't trust anybody more than I do Ken, and I have since  day three or four. <br/>Jeff: So I've been with you. You've been with me. I'm still here. <br/>I’m nor worried. That's right. <br/>Jeff: Adam, what's your pitch? <br/>Look, there comes a time in the game where you have done  everything that you can do to wring your allies all the way to the end, and  now he has to make a choice that's based on more than just loyalty. Who are the people that I can take to the end that I can win  this game for my family. <br/>Jeff: Hannah, right now it sounds like these two are  battling it out. What's your take? <br/>Yeah, I mean, first of all, any of the three of us could  be going, but we saw a lot of truth come out of the last tribal council. We saw Bret leave, congratulating one of the three of us, so  there's a lot more than just loyalty at play tonight. <br/>Jeff: Ken, you were nodding as each one of the three  talked, as though you agree with everything they're saying. <br/>Every point is valid. These are all intelligent, good, bright people. None of these people have walked through this game easily. They've all evolved and grown and shifted and done amazing  things personally but also socially within the game. But at the end of the day, you still have to figure out what is most  important and how does that dib at the present time or affect your decisions  -- how does that dictate or affect your decisions. <br/>Jeff: All right. You're about to make what could be the single biggest decision  in this game. It is time to vote. Hannah, you're up. <br/>Good luck. <br/>You too. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote dave. Adam. One vote dave. One vote Adam. David. Two votes David, one vote Adam. One vote left. 17th person voted out and the 10th and final member of our jury,  David. <br/>So close. <br/>Jeff: You need to bring me your torch. <br/>You did awesome, dave. <br/>Jeff: Great game. <br/>I love you guys. <br/>Jeff: David, the tribe has spoKen. <br/>Playing "Survivor" is the biggest dream I've  ever had, and I’m is grateful I got the play it with all of you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Hannah, Ken, Adam, congratulations. You have made it to the final three. You know what's coming. I'll see you tomorrow night for your final tribal council. Grab your torch, head back to camp, good night. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Obviously I wanted to be sole Survivor, I wanted to win  the million dollars, but I've had so many personal growth from this  experience that I'll walk out of this game a new man, and that's worth more  than a million dollars. So in a way I really did win. [applause]  Jeff: Well, given where he started, David lasted a long  time. He should have been first out. David came in with a fear of everything and grew enter a player  that everyone else feared. It's one of the most dramatic transformations ever. All right. We're down to it. The final three. This is it. "Survivor" finale continues after this. <br/>This is our last morning on this beach. It's day 39 and we are here. I should be like, oh, if sun, but all I can think is I’m hungry. <br/>Something about that generation, they don't know how to  just sit and appreciate something. Talking the entire time. Day 39. I'm here. I'm smiling now. I can breathe. And to be the last person of my gen x tribe, it feels damn good. A lot of people get through in this game without ever doing a  lot of work, and I did the exact opposite. I played an old-school style game, and I played with a level of  loyalty that most people don't show in this game. Let's put some more paper on there. But at the end of the day, there's one motivating factor behind  every single thing that I do, and that's my daughter. I have to win this tonight. To give me and my daughter a better life. Tree mail. Tree mail. <br/>Oh, my God. Wow. Maple syrup. <br/>Bagels, bagels. <br/>Unreal. <br/>And orange juice. I started this game having a lot of the negative stereotypes of  millennials. I was like a neurotic, anxious person, but I've grown into the  player I am. <br/>Congratulations. <br/>You guys are amazing. <br/>I know. This journey has been about learning to be resilient and strong  and learning to hold my own. Day 39 eggs. Tonight tribal council is the firing squad that will test my  personal growth. It's about being calm and confident because I believe I played a  better game than both Adam and Ken, and I believe I deserve to win $1  million. No one from our original tribe thought that the three of us  would be sitting here doing this. <br/>Nobody. <br/>I have played a really  hard game. I found hidden immunity idols. I won individual immunity. I've blindsided others, but I haven't done it in a way that made  me a target. This has been the absolute hardest thing that I've ever done is  leave my family and my mom in this time because of her cancer. If she knew that I was this close to actually winning, I can  only imagine how happy it would make her. That's why I fought so hard to stay in this game. I have to do everything that I possibly can tonight to win it. For her. I cannot let this chance slip away. I cannot let this chance slip away. <br/>Jeff: We now bring in the members of our jury: Michelle, Taylor,  Chris, Jessica, Zeke, will, Sunday, Jay, Bret, and David voted out at the  last tribal council. Hannah, Ken, Adam, congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: It really is quite an accomplishment to get to day  39. But it is not the goal. The goal is to win this game. Tonight the jury, ten people that you voted out of this game,  will decide who wins. Jury, some of you have been coming to tribal council for a long  time, waiting for this moment. I'm going to give you a minute to compose your thoughts. We'll get started. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to begin final tribal council. Taylor, get us started. <br/>All right. Guys, I think I’m one of the more spontaneous millennials here,  and my vote is not set yet. I want you guys to pitch to me why I should vote for you. So Hannah, start us off. <br/>Yeah, I'd just like the start by saying I hope that  everyone stays as open as you. I know some of my moves were not as flashy. I know sometimes they seemed sporadic, but I feel like I played  a very strategic cutthroat game, and I think I deserve your vote because I put  every single member on the jury in the order that they did. I started this game so scared it was going to be me that I was a  mess. Like I was a mess at my first tribal. I was a mess at camp. Day two me would be running and crying, but I’m ready, and bring  it on and I’m ready to explain why I made my decisions. <br/>Okay. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Ken? <br/>I feel like I showed you  as well as so many other people that there are two sides of this game. It's not just about the game. You also are a human being within this game, making moves and  building loyalty allowed me to move forward in this game, and I think that  deserves through credit. <br/>Taylor, I think I should get your vote because I believe I  played the best game out of three of us here. I put myself in a position to not be the person going home and  to keep the people that I wanted to go to the end with safe at each tribal  council. I have a lot more to say tonight, but I'll leave it at that for  now. <br/>Yeah, well, thank you guys. <br/>Jeff: Sunday, you're up. <br/>You know, we've made a lot this season about the  differences between gen xers and millennials. One of the things that I tried to do was to come in and be  adaptable and flexible. My question to each of you is: How were you adaptable in this  game, and do you think you played more like a millennial or a gen xer  regardless of your age? Ken? <br/>I’m very old school. I come from an old family. I'm the youngest. It was very black and white for me. You do this, you don't do this, that's it. <br/>You have a scale like adaptdable and unmovable...  One through ten, where am I at? <br/>I'd say I’m closer to being more rigid than adaptable, but  there is another people who are very adaptable, as quickly as every five  minutes, and that's called a flipper. <br/>Okay. Thank you. Adam? <br/>What you have in front of you is the gen x of "Survivor"  who may have done very well in season one of this game. And then you have the other side of that, someone who was  switching things up to the point where her allies weren't sure what she was  going to do at tribal council. And I do think I’m a combination of both. <br/>I think there's a point  of clarification that needs to be made, though. You just said I’m all over the place, but the vote to get you  out, I felt you and Bret were a dangerous pair. So for me, that move was me being adaptdable to a gain -- game  that was constantly moving, but to you or Bret it feels unpredictable, and Adam  as usual went along with my move. <br/>Those were two times when she went rogue. <br/>I made a decision that I thought  was right. <br/>Beth times I think they were bad strategic decisions. <br/>And I believe they were the right ones and that's the move  I made. <br/>Thank you, Sunday. <br/>Jeff: Jessica? <br/>Ken, you came into this game putting yourself on a  pedestal based upon being loyal and being honest. I'm shocked at the decision that you made on day 38 to take out David,  the one person that you promised on day two you would bring to the end. <br/>The decision that I made on day 38 was the absolute  hardest thing in this game. David, you were my number-two alliance, number one is my  daughter. Only reason. <br/>Thank you. I appreciate the honesty. <br/> Jeff: Thanks, Jessica. Will, you're up. <br/>First I want to say, Ken, as a player of the game, I respected  you so much more for voting David out than I did for all the talk of respect  and loyalty for the first 38 days. Adam, I’m most confused with your game. The Bret move, you were on the wrong side of the numbers with  that vote as well as several other votes, so what do you think was the reason  you weren't able to get those moves to work. <br/>This is one of the two moments where Hannah went rogue. I think it was a terrible decision to leave David in the game  and could have been a million dollar mistake. <br/>And that's because I was making my own decisions and  sticking to my own guns and Adam would get frustrated when he wasn't included  in them. He wanted to vote David first and Bret he wanted to vote you out  after that. If I were to let that happen, I would lose this guy's trust and  trust is the number-one thing with Ken. <br/>Okay. Thank you guys. <br/>Jeff: Zeke? <br/>Parties, congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>It's an exciting time. We're in the midst of the evolution of "Survivor"  strategy. I think tonight's winner should represent that evolution. Ken, you played a loyal game. You were a provider. But you did nothing to evolve the game. So here's how I see it. Adam, Hannah, both of you, how did you contribute to the  strategic evolution of the world's greatest game? Adam? <br/>One of the things I think has happened in recent seasons  is that people, once they take control, think they have to continue to stay  in control throughout the rest of the season. And people saw that you were in control. They saw that Chris was in control. So I made sure that at the final six, there were three people in  front of me that were bigger threats than I was, and one of my best allies  was a challenge beast who could beat them and we could take them out. <br/>Great. Thanks. Hannah, same question. <br/>The idea of building an actual relationship with someone  and working with someone, you and I worked together as a partnership with  trust until we went against each other is what the idea of a trust cluster  is, and I think that is an evolution of the game. And I would like the point out, Adam talks about leaving threats  in the game as sort of shields. I had the same belief, and I decided when those shields would  stay and when they would go, not Adam. I think Adam's very good at taking credit for a lot of moves,  but I feel responsible for most of the jury. <br/>Great. Thanks, guys. Congratulations again. <br/>Thank you very much, Zeke. <br/> Jeff: Thanks, Zeke. Michelle? <br/>Well, first to you, Hannah. How many votes were you on the wrong side of? <br/>I wasn't on the wrong  side of any votes. <br/>Besides the Michaela vote. <br/>Except the Michaela vote. <br/>That's impressive. Good job. Adam, clarify why your victories overshadow the blunders? <br/>Because I think I was able to correct from blunders, and  some of those bluppedders were the blunders of my alliance, as well. <br/>But they were not blunders. They were my choices and they were strategic moves, and that is  what succeeded. <br/>Voting Bret out was not the right move because it put dave  one immunity challenge away from $1 million. <br/>But that was a risk because I knew that Bret wanted to go  to the end with you, not me. And I’m going to own that. Day two me would let Adam tell me this was silly. Day 39 me is not going to take it. And I made the decisions that I wanted to make. <br/>I appreciate that. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Truly from my heart, you guys, good job. <br/>Thanks, Michelle. <br/>Jeff: Bret? <br/>Hey, guys. Going to start with you, Ken. At what point do you feel like you really started playing this  game? <br/>I felt as though I started  playing right off the bat, acknowledging the fact that I was at the very  bottom of gen x. So one of the first conversations I had was going to jess. I said, you have a home with David and I and CeCe and made her  feel safe when before she hadn't felt safe. David and I, two of the people --  Ken, thank you. So you believe you've been playing this game since the  beginning. <br/>Yes. <br/>Okay. Thank you. Adam, I want a breakdown, how long it took to vote out dave,  starting with the Sunday vote and how that all went wrong. <br/>When Hannah came to me with this idea to vote out Sunday  now, she was very sure that this was the right way to go. Oh, by the way, voting you out was a huge blunder, because I had  these allies that, one, would never do what needed to be done. <br/>Thanks. <br/>But I did, actually. <br/>Not never...  Continue to underestimate me. <br/>Never at the final is what I mean. So I made that blunder in thinking that we would get out David  at the final five. <br/>Okay. Thank you very much. I'm going to make my decision. <br/>Jay, you're up. <br/>All right. I got one question, pretty simple, just for you Adam. At one point you said, we're brothers. I told you no matter what happened I was going to take you to  the end with me. Why didn't you use me to take out David when you had the chance? <br/>We have such a crazy relationship, where we are bitter  rivals, but at the same time, I do genuinely love you like a brother, and you  know why. <br/>You don't have to talk about it. <br/>You know why I’m playing this game and why it's so  important to me. Okay. And you were in the way. <br/>Okay. Cool. I'm good. <br/>Thanks, Jay. <br/>Jeff: Chris, you're up. <br/>Well, one thing you guys don't know about me is I’m not a  coach. <br/>Yeah. You're not. <br/>I’m a trial lawyer back  in oklahoma. <br/>Oh, get out. <br/>But what's unique about this experience for me is in my whole  career I've never been able to serve on a jury, but as a trial lawyer, I can't  take the lawyer hat off, so I’m going to advocate for one of you tonight. I believe that story needs to begin, though, with talking about  a little skinny guy standing and lurking in the shadows, planning the demise  of all of us. Of course I’m talking about dave over here. But one of the three of you faced off with the giant of the game  and took him out. Adam, in my opinion, the biggest move in this game was going to Ken,  the most loyal and trusted ally of David, and using your social game, your  cunning, your intelligence and turning Ken against the biggest giant in this  game, something that no one on this jury did, but you did. Good job, young man. I believe that you are the sole Survivor. <br/>Thank you so much. <br/>And I hope all of you will write Adam's name down. <br/>I’m amazed you think he  had the gumption to make that vote because no one convinced me to make that  vote against David. That was my choice. <br/>Jeff: David, close us out. <br/>Congratulations, guys. This experience was transformative. I came in under this dictatorship of fear and anxiety, and I’m going  to leave it ready for a revolution. My question to you is how did this experience change your life  for the better? What evolution did you undergo, and Hannah, we can start with  you. <br/>Yeah. The person I was on day one versus the person I am today are two  completely different people. And I was not built for this game. I was terrified of everything. I was scared to play in the challenges. And pushing through that was what I learned. That's what it's about, and that's something I hope the take  into my life. <br/>Jeff:  Ken? <br/>As someone who from a very young age was quite socially  awkward and manifested that into the ticks, the twitches and everything else  I developed over time, and now I’m putting myself in a position to be  surrounded by 19 strangers on a secluded island where I have to engage and  interact every day. You want the talk about terror, there are moments when I would  wake up and realized, oh, I’m playing Survivor. I'd close my eyes, can I please just go back the dreaming. I don't think I can do it today. I put myself in social positions that normally I never do, and  the reason why is because I have one driving force that brought me here, and  that is my daughter, and I’m playing for her. So that was what I had to overcome to get here. <br/>Thank you. Adam? <br/>This has been a personal dream of mine since I was nine  years old. But two years ago I applied for the blood versus water season  with my mom, and it became our dream together to come and play this game. And so this wasn't about a transformation for me. It was about my family that really, really needs it right now. Seven months ago my mom was diagnosed with stage four lung  cancer. And she's my best friend in this whole world. But even if I don't win tonight, I feel like I was supposed to  come out here. And every time I found an idol and when I won immunity and  especially when I got the loved one visit, I felt like we were winning  together. And so that's what this journey was about for me. <br/>She's thinking about you, Adam. And you're going to see her real soon. <br/>I can't wait. <br/>Thanks, everybody. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, David. All right. There is one thing left to do, and that is vote for a winner. Jury, you've taken in a lot of information tonight. I'll give you a minute to digest all of it. And then we will vote. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to finish what we started 39 days ago. The jury will now decide who they think is most deserving of the  title of sole Survivor and the million dollars -- Hannah, Ken or Adam. It is time to vote. Chris, you're up. Chris, you're up. <br/>Love you, buddy. <br/>Jeff: I'll go get the votes. Thank you all for a great season of "Survivor," and I will  see you back in los angeles for the reading of the votes. You back in los angeles for the reading of the votes. [cheering and applause]  Jeff: Thank you. [cheering and applause]  Jeff: Thank you. Have a seat. Let's do this. This has been such a fun season. I hate to see it come to an end. Hannah, Ken, Adam, congratulations. You did what 17 other people couldn't do. You made it to the end. Big accomplish. Jury, it's themost unique twist of the game. The people voted out decide who wins. You have made your decision, the votes are here. It is time to read the votes. First vote, Adam. Adam. Two votes Adam. Adam. That's three votes Adam. Adam. Four votes Adam. Adam. That's five votes Adam. The winner of "Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen x," Adam. [cheering and applause] well, it was a clean sweep. [cheering and applause] well, it was a clean sweep. Adam got every single vote from the jury. Here's your check for $1 million. Congratulations. This was a season filled with powerful stories. Some of the best game play we've seen. We're going to talk to Adam about how his journey impacted his  entire family and a very emotional update on his mom's battle with cancer. Everybody here. We'll tell you what we're doing next season. The reunion show is next. Congratulations, guys.
