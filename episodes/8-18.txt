<br/>[ cheers and applause]  Probst: We're live in New York City where tonight, one of  these 18 Survivor: All-Stars is going to be awarded a check for a million  dollars based solely on your votes. For the past four days, you've set a record-- 38 million votes  cast. Tonight we reveal the winner. It is Survivor:America's Tribal Council. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION [theme  song playing] [ cheers and applause] [ cheers and applause]  Probst: Welcome! It is a very different feel tonight. It sounds like a thousand people, actually just over a hundred  people in the studio audience tonight. The stage itself is very small and intimate, but the event that  is about to happen is huge. At the end of Sunday's live AllStar reunion show-- which if you  didn't see it was quite lively-- we announced a second million-dollar  giveaway in which one of our 18 All-Stars would get a million dollars, based  simply on your votes, and all week long you've been casting your votes with  text messages from Cingular Wireless and other wireless carriers, also by  going to cbs.com. Tonight, based on those votes, we're going to pare down from 18  to four, and then one, and that one All-Star is gonna walk out of this  building tonight with a check in hand for a million bucks. Yeah. [ cheers and applause] But before we get to our first Final Four  member, a lot has happened since Sunday night. Let's start with Rob and Amber. Just take a look at this. Three magazines have changed their covers. We have Usmagazine cover story, Entertainment Weekly,cover story  and Peoplemagazine cover story, all coming out or on the stands now. [ cheers and applause] You guys haven't stopped since we went  off the air. Give us the update. <br/>We've barely slept since Sunday. It's been, uh, it's been quite a ride. It's a lot of fun. <br/>It's been nice, though, because we get to do a lot  together, and get to spend some time with each other. <br/>Probst: But you act like this is a normal thing. You're on three magazine covers. You've been on Letto-- Leno, Letterman, Stern, Kellyand Regis. You're everywhere. <br/>This is not normal, all right? I took a flight from New York to Las Vegas. I sat in first class, and then the same night they're like,  "Yeah, just go back to New York and now you got another live show to  do."  Yeah. <br/>So it's a little bit extraordinary. <br/>Probst: What's been the weirdest moment so far, Amber,  where you thought, "Wow this is nuts"? <br/>I mean, just like exactly what you said, the fact that I  was on Lettermanand then two seconds later, I was on The View,then two  seconds later, I was on Regis,and... and Regis was at a couple appearances  that I was at. I don't know. We've just... I've been having so much fun. It's tiring, but... It's very overwhelming, but a blast. <br/>Probst: Any offers so far to... for somebody to want to  take this a step further and televise this reality wedding now? <br/>Um... possibly. <br/>Probst: Really? <br/>Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we've had actually a bunch of phone calls from a lot of  people offering outrageous deals. So...  Probst: And what do they want to do? Give us the, give us the dirt. You don't have to name names, but what do they want? They want to televise this? <br/>A photographer said he'd do our pictures for free,  and...  We had, uh, one network come to us just recently and ask  if we'd be willing to put our wedding on television. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Would you be? <br/>A couple...  We're going to talk to our families about it. <br/>We'll talk about it with our families, yeah. <br/>If the price is right, Jeff. [ laughter, applause]  Probst: Well, you know, I'd just like to throw this out  there. As odd as it sounds, I aman ordained minister. We can do it right now and just get it over with. [ cheers and applause]  Probst: Yeah, yeah. <br/>I think my mom would have my neck. <br/>Probst: All right. I want to touch in. Jerri, I'm glad to see you here. [ cheers and applause]  I've, I've already, I've already scoped out the nearest  exit just in case. <br/>Probst: You know, you seem like you're in a good mood  about it. It was a rough moment for you, probably something you certainly  weren't expecting to have that sort of response. <br/>No, and I think that's probably the most shocking part was  just that I-I felt like this season I'd, I opened myself up in a totally  different way and people were very responsive to that, and it seemed very  positive, and so to get booed was just, it was horrifying, and it-it, I was  overwhelmed with emotion and I just... I had to leave. <br/>Probst: Well, how are you feeling about it now? Did you, did you make your point that you were trying to make? <br/>I feel like I made my point the best way I knew how, and that  was by not saying anything, and just leaving, but I think a lot hashappened  since Sunday, and a lot of us have had time to sit down and have a couple of  cocktails and get things out, and I think that there's a lot of healing  that's taking place, and that was kind of the basis of my whole point, was  that we doneed the, the time and the space to heal and-and become friends  again. <br/>Probst: So let me ask you something very direct. You don't know I'm going to ask you this, but a couple hours ago  I got a call from a, from TV Guidesaying that, that you were upset with me  and that one of the things you were upset about with-- well, what, what  areyou upset with, with me about? <br/>Um... The audience. I don't feel that they were told or kept under control well enough  to make us feel safe. That was my biggest complaint. <br/>Probst: And what does that mean? Bodily harm or that you didn't like the response and you, you  wanted us to say, "Be nice"? <br/>Um, well, the final episode has always been for us the  moment when we get to express what we've been holding since the game, and I  felt that with the audience in there and their negative responses and booing  just about everybody up here except a chosen few, none of us really got to  express what it was that we were feeling without being judged once again,  because, I mean, this show wouldn't be Survivorwithout us participating, and  that's our night, and I don't feel like any of us really got to say what  needed to be said. <br/>Probst: Okay. Fair point. You're right, you guys arethe stars of this show. There is no question. It would not be a show without the audience. <br/>Oh, for sure. <br/>Probst: So when the audience speaks, so to speak, you  know, they're speaking. The thing I thought that was interesting... Hatch, give me your  take on this. [ people laughing] Because here's a guy who's been, you actually  likebeing hated, which is, you know, your own thing, but one of the...  I just, I just don't I-I-I'm clear about a game and how,  how the audience doeslook at us as characters, and I'm happy that they feel  whatever they want to feel about me, as a, as-as entertainment. <br/>Probst: Is this a fair observation, that if you enter into  a reality show, in a sense, you dobecome who the audience decides you are. <br/>I knew that going in, and I believe that to this day. I'm not who they think I am, but I-I'm happy that they think I'm  whatever they want to think. It's great. <br/>Probst: Cesternino. [ applause]  Probst: Because, you know, as likable as you are in  person, you were, you were a villain in your season. <br/>Man, that... you know, as Richard has said, this is, this  is a game and it's, it's hard when, uh, when people meet you and they tell  you and they come up to you and say, "Hey, you were a real jerk,"  but you know, just, you know, you gotta be hap... You've made, you-- nobody  knew who you were before, and now they, now they do, and it doesn't necessarily  mean you are that person. It's a good thing, Survivor. <br/>Probst: Lex, what's the impact on the extended family? Because I know you got, you had a rough going Sunday night, and  you said something to me about, "Boy, my kids had to see that and I didn't  like that."  It's, well, I mean, itit has a hugeimpact on your family,  your extended family, your friends, but if you've got a really good thing  going with your family and they feel loved, that's really, that can break  through everyth... anything. That can make up for anything, and like, you know, my son, my  younger son twice had to go through that kind of thing, but you know what,  he's just fine. He's got a great family. They all knew what I was signing up for. We're all good for it. I mean, like they said, you'll get to know us. If you meet us, you'll get to know us more in 60 seconds shaking  our hands than you did in 13 weeks on the tube, but that's okay. We signed up for that. It's all good. Ultimately when this is all done, we've got our lives. We go back to our friends and families. That's all good. <br/>Probst: Last sensitive topic, for the moment. The other thing that was said, Jerri-- because the one great  thing about this show, boy, is you air it all-- is that the only reason you  and many other people were here at the finale and are here tonight is because  of contractual obligation you have with CBS, and I just want to say, from  me,your obligations are fulfilled. If there's anybody who does not want to be here, we don't want  you to be here. We, this should, this should be your choice, and you can leave,  and if you're the million-dollar winner, we'll send you the check. So here's your chance to go if you want to go. Otherwise, I don't want to hear about it anymore. [ cheers and applause] Fair? All right. It looks like all 18 are sticking around for the moment, so  let's get to our first Final Four winner. Let's get some music. [ whooping and hollering] [ theme music playing] There's the  music, all right. Let me give awe few clues about this person. In their season of Survivor, this person dominated in the  challenges. [ shouting] This person played the game the way they lived their  life and some would say that approach cost him a million dollars. <br/>ALL-STARS: Colby! First person to move into the final four... [ cheers and  applause] Come on down. There they are at the Hard Rock Cafe in Dallas celebrating with  Mr. Donaldson. [ applause] Have a seat on that stool, my friend. Here are some of the reasons you voted Colby one of your  favorite Survivor All-Stars. <br/>When I wake up in the morning, there's two things I'm  thankful for-- I'm thankful I'm alive, and I'm thankful I'm a Texan."  How's my family doing? [ howls] I think within the last 24 hours we've all questioned  why in the world we signed up for this. <br/>He filled me in on something I was completely unaware of. <br/>I didn't like the fact that I had to lie, but because I  was lying to Jerri, I didn't lose sleep over it. [ yells] Winning this game means so much to me, and it's so  important to me, because it's been so tough to get to this point. <br/>It's been great. <br/>Unbelievable. <br/>Probst: Survivors, ready! Go! [ cheering]  Yeah, baby! Yeah! Whoo! Got one hell of a winning streak going and I'm just going to  ride it as long as I can. <br/>Probst: Right here, man. Nice work. Out of nowhere. <br/>Yeah! Now we're talking. [ cheers and applause]  Probst: So, Donaldson... ethics... in this game, worked  against you the first time. In a sense, kind of prohibited you from getting the million. Or, to be fair, Tina played you and knew you were a guy that she  could get. Whatever it was, I got to get both sides. Do you think your ethical approach to life and the fact that you  are very well liked, as we saw on Sunday's live show, could work foryou this  time for the million? <br/>Oh, I don't know. I haven't even thought about that. <br/>Probst: Wait, you haven't thought about it? <br/>About whether it works for or against me? I can't control how I'm perceived. And I think that's one of those things that's made it very easy  to sleep at night since I made that decision with Tina. When you make a decision in your life, and to you it is the  truth, you don't worry about how that is perceived or received by anyone  else. And so the voting... [ applause] I don't have any control over  that. And the neat thing about this million is, it's in a lot of ways  a lot more than a million. You don't have to suffer through six weeks to get this one. It's just handed to you, so it's fun to be in this seat, just  with an opportunity. <br/>Probst: You got a one in four shot. <br/>I know it. <br/>Probst: In addition to voting for your favorite All-Star  Survivors, you also voted for a few other categories, including best  Survivorfights. And any time you abandon 16 strangers in the middle of nowhere  and you force them to live together, you can count on one thing-- not  everybody gonna get along. Based on your votes, these are some of your favorite Survivor  fights, and I think they speak for themselves. <br/>Do not yell at me about the...  I am not getting emotionally attached. <br/>You can get as emotionally attached, but don't jump all  over me, sweetheart. <br/>Don't wave your finger in my face. <br/>I will always wave my finger... [ screams]  TED: I'm not even attracted to you. I am 150 to 200 percent happy with the wife that I have. <br/>He came at me and I put my hands out and pushed him in. Backwards hick. Did you hear him? [ nonsensical moaning] Screaming at me, dude. I wanted to spit in his face. <br/>Damn it, look at me! <br/>I'm looking at you. <br/>What the ... was that ...?! <br/>I made a decision based on...  You're starting this... now! <br/>It's about being betrayed by my friend. It's about getting a knife in the back. <br/>The word I gave you, and make no mistake about it, Lex,  was that "if I can take care of you, I will." I'm sorry I could  not. [ cheers and applause]  Probst: That was a heated vote. The most votes were actually cast for the Rupert-Jon fight,  believe it or not... which was a battle, and a side of you we don't often  see. Something I want to get to though, before we go to break, is a  quick update. Over the last four days, anything change between Lex and Boston  Rob? <br/>At this point, nothing's changed on my end. Like I said before, Jeff, I've apologized, and I don't know what  to do if he doesn't want...  Probst: Lex, how does he sit in your life? Quick update. <br/>Honestly, I've got no hard feelings. I don't really have any feelings at all, it's fine. <br/>Probst: All right. Big Tom, Boston Rob, you guys shook hands, but I wasn't quite  sure that was a full-on "yeah, yeah, I got it."  You know, Boston Rob, I'm 48, and I think me and him will  work through the pain. <br/>Probst: Nicely done. [ applause] Okay, up next, another All-Star is going to be one  step closer to a million dollars. And we'll find out who you think is the sexiest Survivor guy. But first, take a look at this, you voted it one of your  favorite greatest Survivor moments. <br/>This island is pretty much full of only two things--  snakes and rats. We have Richard, the snake, who knowingly went after prey, and  Kelly, who turned into the rat, trying to run from the snake. I feel we owe it to the islands to let it be in the end, the way  Mother Nature intended to it be-- for the snake to eat the rat. [ cheers and applause]  Probst: Welcome back to Survivor: America's Tribal  Council. Tonight's show is all about you. Since Sunday night, you've been voting for the SurvivorAll-Star  you most want to win a million dollars. 38 million votes were cast via Cingular Wireless and other wireless  carriers, text messaging and also at cbs. com. We are counting down from 18 to four. We have our first member of the final four, Mr. Colby Donaldson. And he's about to get some competition. [ applause] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Before we get to the next final four member, here are the guys  you nominated as sexiest Survivormen. From Survivor: Africa,Ethan Zohn. Boston Rob, the runner-up in Survivor: All-Stars,now fiancÃ      to Amber Brkich. There's Hunter Ellis from Marquesas. One of my favorites, Greg Buis, the earphone man from Borneo. Also from Borneo,one of the nicest guys, Gervase Peterson. There's Burton Roberts checking out his guns. Robb Zbacnik checking out his look. Andrew Savage, rugby player and attorney, strolling in the water  from the Pearl Islands. There's Alex Bell from the Amazon. And finally, Colby Donaldson, the Australian Outback... in need  of a shave. And America's choice for sexiest Survivorman... Colby Donaldson. [ cheers and applause] Like... [ cheering] As if you needed the  help, now have you that mantle you can...  Does it pay anything? <br/>Probst: Nothing. Let me ask you though, quickly. How much has your life changed from three years ago when you  were in a small town in Texas, an auto customizer? Now you're living in L.A. pursuing acting, working, getting, you know, ad campaigns and  all kinds of stuff. How different is your life? <br/>It's, it could not be more of a 180. And I owe so many of my opportunities to Survivor. I mean, I signed up watching Richard Hatch and Sue and those  guys and Jenna on the first show, signed up just being a true fan of the  game, and literally went for the experience. And all of this is truly icing on the cake. I had no idea, I had no plans for it. I've stepped through the door of opportunity and had a blast the  entire time. <br/>Probst: All right, well, you're about to get some  competition. Time to add another All-Star to the final four. We'll bring in the music. [ chanting music] Let me give you a few more clues about this  person. It's very dramatic. [ laughing] This Survivorloves to dance. <br/>Tom! Oh, Big Tom! <br/>Probst: They've been known to put back a beer or two. [ applause] And when he tries real hard you can almost  understand what he's saying. Big Tom, step on down to the final four stool. [ cheers and applause] [ cheering, applause]  Probst: There they are back in Big Daddy's house in Rich  Valley, Virginia, all excited for Big Tom. [ cheering]  Oh, man. <br/>Probst: Take a look at some of the reasons you voted Big  Tom one of your favorite Survivors. <br/>[ indiscernible twang] come up there and make a big ba-gob  of love and I'll tell her...  Yeah, we need the translator on that one. [ tribal music plays]  Tom's whole, you know, "I'm a hayseed from Virginia,  I'm not that smart," I knew quickly that he was a lot brighter than he  let on. And actually that endeared me to him and intrigued me all the  more. <br/>Hey, bartender, fix me a toddy. Old Big Tom going to love everybody. [ laughs] My mind has been a pretty little old tight thing. It's not been expanded very much, but this whole thing has gave  me new life. At 45, I thought I'd done some things, and I found out I ain't  done diddly. This just shows me that there's more to life than just what's  around the corner at the house. [ cheers and applause]  Probst: Kind of fun to look back on that and see all those  memories again? <br/>Wow. What a surprise. I can't even put a calculator on, couldn't even vote for myself. <br/>Probst: Are you actually touched? Am I seeing a little...? <br/>Yeah. Yeah, I have to admit, yeah. Get me, get me a Kleenex. Somebody get me a... But, you know, for a man that's never been  anywhere, I've been everywhere now, and I don't know, but I owe so much to  old Mark Burnett and whoever said "Take old Big Tom," because I  never watched the show, and I guess, thank you, Sandy, for putting my  application in. <br/>Probst: That being your wife? <br/>Yeah, that'd be my wife. <br/>Probst: We're glad to have you down there. <br/>I'm glad to be down here. <br/>Probst: We've still got two spots left. We have two in the final more, two in the final four, two more  of these guys will join them. Who will it be? Plus the hottest female survivor. But now here's another greatest Survivormoment. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>He's burnt. He's burnt pretty bad. <br/>Here's some water. <br/>Look at these things. <br/>Oh, keep your hands in the water! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh! It just keeps, it keeps intensifying. <br/>I know, I know, Mike. <br/>You guys do what's right. You guys know what to do. <br/>I'll take my clothes off for chocolate and peanut butter. <br/>Get the girl some chocolate and peanut butter, Probst. <br/>Probst: One heaping plate of rich peanut butter, chocolate  cookies. <br/>Heidi, do you want to do it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>All right. <br/>Oh, God, why me? I'm not looking. <br/>Where can I keep my clothes? <br/>I'm looking. <br/>That's what I'm talking about. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Ta-da! <br/>All the kids at school-- I'm not looking  Probst: Another one of our greatest Survivormoments  featuring Jenna Morasca. Any regrets on that? <br/>Absolutely not. It's the only way people remember me. That's fine with me. <br/>Probst: That is true. <br/>The naked bitch and I'm fine with that. <br/>Probst: You think you're more famous for getting naked  than winning? <br/>Probably, and that's okay. I was so hungry, I could have cared less what anyone thought, I  still don't. <br/>Probst: Rob Cesternino, how important are hot women to a  good season of Survivor? <br/>Especially naked ones. <br/>Before I went on Survivor,I didn't know any hot women, and  now I know... now I know quite a few. Some that I didn't meet in Survivor. But yeah, it's...  Probst: You ended up, you got a much cuter girlfriend than  you would have gotten before Survivor. <br/>Yeah, she's beautiful. <br/>Probst: okay. The season's almost over. Might as well get all your shots out. At the start of each season, it is one of the most asked  questions, to me anyway, "Probst, how are the women this season?"  Sexy women are always a big part of Survivor. Here are the ladies you nominated as the hottest Survivorwomen. Heidi from the Amazon in the memorable younger prettier girls  bathing scene. And her sidekick, Jenna Morasca, the winner of Survivor: Amazon. Together, they posed for the cover of Playboy There's Colleen  Haskell, the first Survivorcutie from season one. And look at those abs. That's Elizabeth, from Australia, now a co-host on The View. One of the sexiest villains of all time, we love her, Jerri  Manthey, from Australia. Cleopatra herself, Sarah Jones from Marquesas. Probably the most physically fit survivor ever, Alicia Calaway  from Australia. Erin Collins from Thailand and I think that speaks for itself. There's Darrah the mortician from Pearl Islands, getting clean. And finally the winner of Survivor: All-Stars,and that truly is  a million-dollar smile, Amber Brkich. [ cheers and applause] And the woman you voted the hottest survivor  ever... Amber. Now, Mariano, she's already beautiful, now she wins Survivor  All-Starsand now she's the sexiest little... She's yours, is there...? <br/>She's mine. You just got it right there. <br/>Probst: Yeah, you're right, that's it, you're the one who  won. <br/>That's right. <br/>AUDIENCE: Aw...  Probst: We're not going back there again, are we? Okay, let's review where things stand: 38 million people voted,  we know. We're paring down from 18 to four to one. That one's going to walk out of here with a check for a million  bucks. There are already would people sitting here. It is time to add a third. The music's already started. That means it's a cue to get up and walk over and read some  clues. This survivor is a natural in the outdoors. This survivor has an alligator for a pet, and while they may  have made fun of him as a kid, they are loving him now, the third person to  join our final four, Rupert! [ cheers and applause] There they are in your home town, Rupert. <br/>Yeah... yeah...! <br/>Probst: That's the Vapor Lounge in Indianapolis, one of  the hot new clubs there. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Take a look at some of the reasons you voted Rupert  one of your favorite Survivor All-Stars. <br/>I'm a thrilled pirate. I am Blackbeard. Happy, happy, happy. The other team, Morgan, came up, sat their stuff down next to us  and all left! Everything that I could find in theirs, I took. I hope I see that big six-foot shark, I hope I see that  yellowfin tuna, I hope I see that grouper that's this big. I'm coming out here to be the caretaker, and I think I'm doing  it. I portray a very strong and independent person. But in my head, I'm that fat little terrified kid that was  picked on in school all his life. We got fire! Yay! <br/>Probst: Rupert, come say hello to your wife, Laura. <br/>I never give up. I never surrender. I never admit defeat. <br/>Probst: Rupert wins reward! [ cheers and applause] Rupert, the thing you said in there--  never give up, never surrender, never admit defeat-- did that just come to  you out there or is that a motto you life your life with? <br/>That is something that I've told my boys for a long time  that I mentor and other people around me. You don't give up, you don't quit, you do what you say, you say  what you do, you go out there, you win, you do the best you can and never  give up. <br/>Probst: Well, congratulations, you are part of our final  four. There is one spot left. There are 15 survivors left, they all want it. Who's going to fill the last spot? We will find out. We'll take a quick break and on the way out enjoy this. It is another of your greatest Survivormoments. <br/>It was either going to be my buddy or my grandmother  coming, and my grandmother is not here for a reason. She's... she's not around. My grandmother is sitting home watching Jerry Springerright now. [ cheers and applause]  Probst: We have filled three of our final four slots in  search of a million dollars. We're going to put one more person down there, but Survivor  without villains just wouldn't be the show it is. We've had some memorable villains. Here are some of your favorites. Everybody remembers the Richard Hatch was the first  Survivorwinner, and his Machiavellian ways set the tone for future survivors. <br/>I've got the million dollar check written already, I'm the  winner. And it's that kind of cocky attitude that makes people really  hate your guts. <br/>Probst: Australia brought us our first femme fatale. The sexy Jerri Manthey knew what she wanted and she would stop  at nothing to get it. <br/>I'm not losing any sleep. I just know that she's thinking ahead. Don't worry about it. It's not like you're making a deal with the devil here. <br/>Probst: Brian Heidik the used car salesman from Quartz  Hill, California, was perhaps the smoothest of our villains, using charm to  sucker his prey and it earned him a million bucks. <br/>You gotta be ice cold, you can't lose your cool. You gotta be like ice. Mr. Freeze is in the house. <br/>Probst: A self-proclaimed student of the game, Rob  Cesternino kept his Amazon tribemates laughing, while he worked his evil ways  behind the scenes. <br/>I want them just to remember all the fun we had and not  all the bad things I did to them. I don't know people dwell on the negative. <br/>Probst: And who could ever forget John Dalton, AKA Johnny  Fairplay, the guy who lied about his dead grandma. <br/>Promises are like wicker furniture and fat women, easily  broken by Johnny Fairplay. <br/>Probst: And America's choice for favorite villain, he's  sitting in the front row, Johnny Fairplay. There's a guy who embraces his villainous ways. Quick update, Fairplay. We don't have a lot of time. What are you doing right now? <br/>I thought this was the casting for All-Star Two. Like, you guys have an award show or something going on? <br/>Probst: You're still bitter you weren't on  All-stars,aren't you? <br/>Whoa, hey, hey! I'm a pro wrestler now, Jeff. I do... I'm beating up good guys or whatever. <br/>Probst: Give us a plug. What are you doing? <br/>T&amp;A wrestling every night on pay per view. And starting June fourth every Friday 3:00 p.m. on Fox Sports Net. <br/>Probst: Fairplay, all jokes aside, congratulations. We're glad you're here. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: And good luck getting into the after party. Okay. We only have one final four slot left. Let's fill it. Let's do the music. [ theme music playing] This survivor is one of the most  competitive Survivorplayers ever. This person gave new meaning to the phrase, "I give you my  word," and although he didn't get the money, he got the girl. The fourth Final Four-- Boston Rob. [ cheers and applause] There's Boston Rob's home town. Aunt Mary Lisa and Uncle Dennis's house in Canton,  Massachusetts. Rob, I know you've been working it all week. You've had the advantage. You've done a lot more press than some of the other people and  you, your claim is, "Forget popular. I earned it. I deserve it."  No doubt. I mean, what's the question? Rupert is by far the most popular contestant out there. Everybody knows that. But I don't think, uh... I don't think anybody will argue with  the fact that I think I played the game the hardest this time around. <br/>Probst: All right. [ applause and cheering] Well, here are some of the reasons you  voted Boston Rob one of your favorite Survivor All-Stars. <br/>What do you think, you want to mike an alliance? Amber is slammin'. She's sweet, she's beautiful, she's funny, she's got a great  personality. Her ass is smokin', too. [ audience laughter] At the end of this, hopefully Amber and I  will be spending my million. Worst case scenario, we'll be spending hers. <br/>Go, Rob! Win it! Yay! <br/>And I may not be as strong as some of them... but I  guarantee, I'm tougher than every single one of them. <br/>Probst: He's got it! Boston Rob comes from behind! <br/>I can't trust anybody. I kind of have a mark on my back. <br/>You marked yourself every time you won. <br/>It's a tough principle, but fear keeps people loyal. That's straight out of The Godfather. It's true. <br/>It's about being betrayed by my friend. <br/>You want to put our friendship on the line, I'll put our  friendship on the line over this-- the word I gave you was that if I can take  care of you, I will. I'm sorry I cannot. [ applause and cheering]  Probst: When you see that moment played back-- and I've  asked you this many different ways-- is there any part of you that says,  "Ah, you know, if I delivered news a little more nicely, it might get a  different reaction?"  You know, Jeff, I-I truly didn't mean to, uh, hurt  anybody's feelings or be malicious about the whole thing. I used friendship in this game. I used every tool available to me to get further. I was playing a game. That's the way I looked at it, and I don't have any regrets  about it. <br/>Probst: Fair enough, well said. [ applause] All right, your votes have narrowed it down from 18  to four. There are four somewhat disappointed all-stars behind them,  there are four very excited all-stars sitting in front of them, and there's  nothing left to do but reveal the final results, and we're going to do that  right after this break. [ applause and cheering]  Probst: Okay. [ applause and cheering]  Probst: Okay. This is it. There will be no more commercial breaks between now and the  announcement of the winner. Couple of pieces of business, though. One is, we have a lot of Survivorfans. If you want to own a part of the show, all the proceeds go to  the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. All of us are very familiar with this organization. You can go to eBay. com, click on Survivor,and buy their torches or the votes or any  of those props. Okay, we are very close to finishing finally the Survivor:  All-Starseason. Doesn't mean Survivoris over. We're coming back in September, and here is where we are going  next. In the remote waters of the South Pacific, near the tumultuous  Ring of Fire, is an exotic land where ancient cultures thrive and nature  makes its fury known. These are the islands of Vanuatu. In this land of volcanoes and ritual, sorcery is real, and the  spirits of the dead are believed to have power over the living. More than 80 islands are home to over 100 languages. And a diverse group of tribes and clans live out their history  in today's world. Vanuatu is home to the famous land divers of Pentecost Island. Vanuatu is also a land with a fascinating history of  cannibalism. But these islands are also a tropical paradise, with untamed  jungles, stunning beaches, and crystal blue waters. The indigenous people have made this archipelago home for more  than 5,000 years. Soon, 16 new castaways will be abandoned here, forced to make a  new world while competing against each other. Find out this fall who will outwit, outplay and outlast all the  others in Survivor: Vanuatu, Islands of Fire. [ applause and cheering]  Probst: Well, every season brings us great Survivor  moments, but tonight we've been counting down your favorite greatest  Survivormoments, and of all of the moments, this was voted the number one,  your favorite Survivormoment of all time. Take a look. <br/>The other team, Morgan, came up, sat their stuff down next  to us, and all left. If they were going to be silly enough to put it right next to  me, I'm going to put it in my thing. Everything that I could find in theirs, I took. Pirates pillage, pirates steal. <br/>Whose are these? <br/>Pirated. <br/>Oh. [ laughter]  Yeah, it's a hard life, living the pirate's life. [ applause and cheering]  Probst: All right, it is time. The check is right here in my back pocket. And I think it's worth noting that in terms of winners, women  outnumber men in this game five to three in terms of how many times they've  won, and we have no women in the final four, whatever that means. Okay. This is it. The winning name is in this envelope. Not going to be any screwing around, I'm not going to say it is  you, it's not you, they didn't like you. I'm going to open it, I'm going to read one name, and that's it. The name in this envelope is the winner. The name in this envelope is going to get a check for a million  bucks, and I'm going to sign it and put your name on it right after I read  it. I'm going to stand up to do it. According to America... 38 million votes say the favorite  SurvivorAll-Star is... Rupert. [ applause and cheering]  What up, brother? <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Go say hi to your wife. <br/>Probst: Rupert? wife. <br/>Probst: Rupert? Rupert? <br/>Yeah, it's okay, my baby. It's okay. Come on up here. <br/>Probst: Come here. [ applause and cheering continues] Stay right there. One million bucks right there. Take a look at this. That's all you, baby. Congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Happy birthday. Good day for Daddy. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Yay! <br/>Probst: That's it! Survivor All-Stars is over. We'll see you in September in Vanuatu.
