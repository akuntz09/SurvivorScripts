<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," at tribal  council, Devens saved himself. <br/>I would like the play this hidden immunity idol for  myself. <br/>Jeff: But Victoria, Lauren, Gavin, and Aurora had a  back-up plan. Ron, the tribe has spoken. And Ron grabbed the torch and headed to the Edge of Extinction. <br/>Well, that went especially well considering we weren't  together on that. <br/>The last tribal council I blindsided Ron. That was probably the most guilt y I have felt voting someone  out. I felt like I had to separate my heart from the game. <br/>I saw those Rones. <br/>Now that he's gone, I think all the focus just went straight  toward Devens, because you know Devens is the idol and advantage king right  now. Devens needs to go home. <br/>Do you know who sent you that one? <br/>I don't know who sent it. It just said, "This came from the Edge of Extinction."  I told everyone I got the idol from Edge of Extinction instead of Vata beach. I want to be the only one out here grinding and working to find  the idols. <br/>That was anonymous? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>For real? <br/>It came from the edge. <br/>If they think all advantages come from the Edge of  Extinction, that plays right into my hands. I think I'm still on the bottom. No one is coming to work with me, sap maybe Julie because she  was blindsided. I will have to get really clever in any other way I can  manipulate the game. <br/>That was a good night. <br/>That was a good night. The trash that came out. At this point I'm happy. I felt outcasted before, but now, for the first time, there are  people I can work with. My alliance right now is between Victoria, Lauren, Gavin, and  myself. <br/>All the advantages are gone. <br/>You know, I truly do feel connected with my alliance, but Devens  is a threat, and it's going to be more difficult than we thought to get him  out. And so Devens is target number one. I want him out! <br/>At tribal last night, Ron went home. That was great. But if I hadn't had that idol, it was me going home. I know the only way I'm getting the final three is if I work and  get myself there. The early bird gets the worm. I have to find it before anyone else. To get to the end of the game, like I'm going to have to do it  alone. <br/>Are you worried about Devens, you guys? <br/>I am. <br/>I'm always worried about Devens. He's looking. He's going to be looking all day. <br/>One of us just needs the stay with him. <br/>Rick is a huge liar. I mean, he didn't get gifted an idol from distinction. He found the idol. <br/>He was lying about the idol. I can tell. I think he found it here. <br/>I have the hidden immunity idol from the original Manu  beach up my sleeve. So I know that idols do come from this island, but nobody else  knows, so I'm definitely looking for the idol, but most importantly, I want  to make sure that Rick does not have one. <br/>What's the word? <br/>He's a little liar. The idol was on this beach. <br/>I know for a fact it wasn't Rick. <br/>I hope there's one out here. I need it. <br/>You can tell me. I don't care. <br/>The vote still went against me, so I don't feel like I can  trust anybody. I'm either going to protect me or I'm going to go home. We'll see how it all goes I guess. <br/>All right. <br/>I think the rice is almost done. <br/>I had it all worked out for everybody last night. That was an awesome moment all around. <br/>Agreed. <br/>The last two Manu standing. <br/>I feel like it's idol or bust. I have to find the idol. If I don't find it, I'm back at the Edge of Extinction. But I'm going to keep hustling until the end of this game. But I'm going to keep hustling until the end of this game. I am working harder than everybody else. Please be an idol. Please be an idol. <br/>Congratulations. You found the hidden immunity idol. Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh. Breaking news. Another idol found. And it was me. I'm so excited. I've been at the bottom for so long. And that can be so defeating. But I'm working as hard as I can to bring the money home for my  family. And I'm getting stRonger. And I absolutely feel stRong, and I know my family's going to be  really proud of me. I am, too. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! All right. Let's get to today's reward challenge. For today's challenge, you're going the race out with a ball,  toss it up and into an overhead trap, and then catch it on the other side. You'll then dig under a beam and race to the finish. Once you have both balls, you'll attempt to land them on an  overhead perch. First to finish wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: The win her be taken by helicopter for a tour of  these beautiful Fijian islands. A little perspective on where you've been living for the last 32  days. You will then touch down at a luxury resort poolside, chicken,  pasta, seafood, open bar, chocolate mousse for dessert. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Worth playing for? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Yeah, man. <br/>Jeff: Let's draw for spots. We'll get it on. All right. Here we go. For reward, Survivors ready? Go! First you got to toss that ball up into the trap. Once it starts rolling and gets through the only and catch it  before it drops. Gavin is good with his first. Aurora has her first. Both heading back for their second ball. That's how you do it. Brand-new leg on a Survivor challenge. <br/>This is hard. <br/>Jeff: Victoria lands one. Got to get there to the end. <br/>Caught it. <br/>Jeff: Nice catch by Victoria. Devens is good. Lauren in and out. Here goes Aurora for her second. Aurora, can she catch it? Yes, she's good. Here's gaffigan for -- Gavin for his second. Gavin takes a big fall. Can he save it? Gavin falls again. He's going to have to go back. It's Aurora in the early lead. Now you've got to dig under that beam. Lauren finally lands one. Got to get to the end. She's good. Julie still trying to get some momentum. She's got it. Can she get through? No. Here comes Devens. Devens has his second. Victoria has her second ball. Gavin tripping, can he save it? Gavin has his second. He's good. Aurora is first one through. Gavin, Devens, and Victoria still digging. There goes Aurora. She can start firing. Gavin is through. There goes Devens. Victoria is through. Julie and Lauren still trying to get back in it. <br/>Oh, my God. I can't get it in the freakin' thing. <br/>Jeff: You got to land two balls on a very narrow perch. Devens on and off. Lauren has her second ball. She's trying to get back in it. Gavin has his first ball, working on that second. He only needs one more to win its. Aurora trying to get in it. Devens still working to get in it. Victoria has her first ball. It's Gavin on one end, Victoria on the other. Aurora has her first ball. We've got three in it now. <br/>Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Devens, on and off. Victoria could win it right there. No. Gaffigan -- Gavin for the win. <br/>Jeff. <br/>Jeff: And he does. Gavin wins reward. <br/>Great job, gav. <br/>Jeff: Gavin, come on over. <br/>Good job, gav. <br/>Jeff: All right, Gavin. Day 32. Six people left in the game. You know what you're doing. You're going to get a nice afternoon, a lot of food. Now, choose one person to join you. <br/>I'm basing this decision off of who hasn't been on the  most rewards and I feel like who has been struggling at camp pretty hard here  lately. I got to go with my girl, v. <br/>Jeff: Victoria. All right, Gavin, you have one more choice. You're bringing one more person. Who is it going to be? <br/>No matter who you pick, you're going to have three people  who are sour that they weren't one of the ones chosen. So I've got to go with Lauren. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, come on over. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: Instant reaction from Devens an Aurora. Devens, what's going on over there? <br/>I thought it would be Aurora. She's been the longest without a thing, just like vic. <br/>I'm shocked that Aurora didn't get picked. <br/>It's a game. I'm just hungry. <br/>She's hungry. <br/>Jeff: All right, Gavin, Lauren, Victoria, nice afternoon. Once-in-a-lifetime experience on "Survivor" plus a  belly full of food. Julie, Aurora, Devens, got nothing for you. Gab your stuff, head back to camp. Enjoy. <br/>Right now I am upset. I have never really been part of a big group in this game, and  my alliance had a chance for me to not be on the bottom. But now I feel like I'm not good enough to be in a group, that  people don't want me in it, and it feels horrible. <br/>Day 32! Fiji. <br/>Look at this. <br/>Look at the water. It's amazing. <br/>You can't beat this. <br/>Oh, my gosh. Winning this reward is a life-changing moment for me, because  I've only been in a plane twice. I've never been in a helicopter. We're turned on our side with the door wide open. It almost feels like a roller coaster. Heck of a lot different than disney world. <br/>Is that our camp? <br/>That's Aurora. <br/>Wonderful. <br/>I chose to take Victoria and Lauren instead of Aurora. I'm sure Aurora is hurt at my decision, but I hope that she's a  smart enough player to know she's still better off going with me, Victoria  and Lauren over working with someone like Devens who has a clear shot of  winning this game. <br/>Look how beautiful. <br/>Perfect. <br/>Congratulations. <br/>Congratulation, guys. It's the best reward. Thank you, Gavin. <br/>Good. It's great. <br/>Enjoy it. <br/>Us three have to stick together. <br/>Devens has to be next. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>We have the keep going. So if Devens wins immunity tomorrow, what do we do? <br/>I'd say Julie. <br/>Yeah. You going to talk to Aurora to see where her head is at? <br/>As of right now the three of us all agree that Devens has  to go. And Gavin and Victoria are thinking Julie. But I'm really worried. Julie and I have been close kind of since right around the  reward. We have been building this trust. So I personally don't want to take Julie out. So I personally don't want to take Julie out. <br/>Hi, guys. Welcome back. <br/>Coming back from the reward, I knew I needed to talk to Aurora  to assure her on our end nothing has changed. The most important thing is moving together as a foursome. <br/>I'm really sorry. <br/>Aurora is just an emotional player. So now I have to doubly reassure her that nothing has changed  and, you know to, win this game that it would be smartest for us to stick  together. <br/>Nothing changed. We need the four of us to stay together. I ode like Devens first. I know, that but I would like to get rid of Julie as soon as  possible, so I think the final four doesn't change at all. <br/>Well, here's the thing, it sucks because again I'm not  chosen when people are picking people, and I've been on the outside. I'm going to trust in the final four. I have to have trust. But what am I going to do, switch? <br/>No. So automatically Victoria wants to explain there was no ill will  from their side being on the reward. Even if I have doubts, it is the most logical choice to stay in  this alliance. I just want to move forward to get out Devens and Julie. So at this point I have to stick with my plan. So at this point I have to stick with my plan. <br/>Special delivery. <br/>Oh, my God. What is that? <br/>Meeting. <br/>Eric, oh, my gosh, please. <br/>I found thisi flagpole. You have been pushed further than anticipated, and you have  withstood the test. This is the letter you wrote to yourself before the game. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Find a spot and remind yourself why you are here. <br/>Oh. <br/>Try to remember all the good things waiting for you now at  home. Don't forget you're one of the lucky ones. What an adventure, huh? What a story to tell. <br/>I started this journey not necessarily knowing exactly  what my purpose was here beyond the game. There's a part in this that says this is every experience  teaches you something. This too has a purpose. You have been through a hell of a lot and never gave up. You are a fighter. You have already won. I would have never realized this without this journey. <br/>Be confident. Be sneaky. Be the ultimate Survivor that you are. Get after it. <br/>The entirety of the letter is about how I want to play a  perfect game. I failed at that. But having the Edge of Extinction, the introspective, the  personal quest to find out who I am, how much I've grown and how much I've  changed, that's what I'm taking home. It's not even worth the $1 million. That's priceless. <br/>The only validation you need is from within. You are a unique weirdo. Do not be afraid to show it. <br/>I'm a 44-year-old child, so "Survivor" can have  maturing effect. With any lucky use my time out here to return to my girlfriend  leah with a focus on turning our relationship into something even bigger. <br/>I hope this brings me a new patience. I hope to be more self-sufficient and independent. I'm in the needy, but I can always be better. Weird. I can't believe that. I was so caught up on this you were voted out first, you're a  loser, but it took me so long to finally be proud of myself and realize, wow,  I am a Survivor. Wow. I have learned so much. I would have never ever in a million years guessed it from  writing this that everything would just come full circle. I mean, that's pretty cool. And I'm still here. I don't give up. <br/>Six days left. <br/>I'm doing what I can do. <br/>My plan right now is I have my idol. Now I'm doing everything I am to totally mess with everyone else  that I'm in camp. With I can rest on day 40, but right now it's everything into  the game. <br/>You following around gives me the disconcerting feeling  that you might vote me out tonight. <br/>No. <br/>We're afraid that Devens has another advantage or another  clue or something like that. So it looks like it's going to be another day of idol hunting  and paranoia, which sucks. <br/>I am having a ton of fun wearing these guys out. I feel like a kid, or like a fugitive. Either one is just as fun. Hiding behind trees. <br/>I'm not jumpy like that. <br/>I'm laughing all the way, because I know I already have  what they're looking for, what they're worried I have. They don't have the endurance or drive to keep up, and I know  it's driving them crazy. <br/>Where is he going? <br/>He's got nothing to lose right now. <br/>You think he's just in the middle of the woods making  something? <br/>Could be if he's given up looking. <br/>I think Rick has gone crazy. He disappears out of nowhere. It's like hide and seek. So we're just walking around aimlessly trying the find him. <br/>I love making them paranoid, because it makes them  mentally and emotionally exhausted. It brings me joy, which gives me energy and it's going to push  me through this game. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. Let's get to today's immunity challenge. Gavin, got the take back the necklace. Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's chang, you're going to race to slide letter tiles  into target. You'll then use two handles to transport those tiles through a  series of obstacles. Finally, you'll use the letter tiles to solve a six-word phrase. First to finish wins immunity, safe from the vote, guaranteed to  see day 35. Losers, tribal council where somebody will be voted out. Aurora, during the entire explanation, you were shaking your  head, moving your body. What is happening right now? <br/>I hate word puzzles. Like, uh. I just want to win so badly, but when you come in already  doubting yourself, it sucks. <br/>Jeff: Devens, that's exactly what you want to hear in this  game. Any doubt from any other player, beauty. <br/>Absolutely. If they're all bad at word puzzles, I only have to be mediocre. That's great for me. <br/>Jeff: All right. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. Good luck. All right. Here we go. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! This first stage is a game you play in your backyard, sliding  tiles. When you hear that clang, that's a good thing. When they start to clog out, you just got to grab them, bring  them back, and slide them again. Devens getting them through. Aurora doing all right. Everybody is getting close. Lauren is first through with all of hers. She can start stacking them. Devens has all of his. Aurora is good. Gavin has all of his. Here goes Lauren now transporting a pretty decent amount. Yo you've got to get over two beams. You can move as many as you think you can carry at once. Lauren finds out the hard way that was a few too many. She drops. Got to go back. Here comes Aurora. Here comes Gavin. Aurora has a big stack. Gavin going more conservatively. There goes Aurora. First beam is good. Gavin is good with first beam. Once you complete a phase, you're good in that phase. Aurora drops. She's got to go back. Devens is good. Gavin drops. Devens drops. Nobody's gotten to the end yet. Here comes Lauren. A smaller stack this time. And she's whipping through it. Lauren is first back with a few tiles. Gavin right behind her. Here comes Aurora. She's good. <br/>Jeff, I'm playing. <br/>Jeff: Victoria has her first pieces back. Thank you, Victoria. Julie is good. Devens is good. Here comes Lauren with a bigger stack this time. Gavin once again staying small and conservative. Here comes Devens with more. Aurora drops again. She's got to go back. Gavin drops. He's good. Everybody is picking up the pace. Immunity on the line on day 34. Lauren is good. Victoria is good. Julie is good. Everybody heading back for more. Here comes Aurora. She hates anything to do with words. <br/>Except speaking. I like to talk. No Gavin now going to go with a couple extra tiles this time. Lauren back with more tiles. Julie is getting the hang of this quickly. Here comes Devens with his last letter tiles. Gavin drops. Lauren is good. She goes back for more tiles. Aurora with a huge stack of tiles, trying to make up some time. Devens has all his tiles. He can start working. Six-word phrase. Aurora has her last tile. She can start working. You have been fighting for 34 days. Not going to quit now. She's good. Lauren has the last of her tiles. It is Devens, Aurora, and Lauren right now. Like every word phrase on "Survivor," it will be  difficult and yet seem obvious when it's over. Every second counts in this challenge. Julie drops. Those are seconds she cannot get back. Here comes Victoria with the last of her letter tiles. She can start working. Gavin is back. <br/>I still have some more. <br/>Jeff: Gavin still has to go back for more tiles. That's where the conservative approach is costing him time now. Julie is good. Everybody back working on their word puzzle except for Gavin. So many words you could spell with these letters. Use your "Survivor" knowledge. One phrase potentially worth $1 million if you survive tonight. <br/>Okay. Devens thinks he has something. Don't want to say anything, because you don't want anybody to  know, because you could get this very fast. <br/>Jeff. Jeff. Jeff! En. <br/>Jeff: Devens thinks he might already have it. Not living on the edge tonight. Devens wins immunity. <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>Jeff: Safe tonight at tribal council. Cannot be voted out of this game. Wow. That was fast. Devens, come on over. Safe once again at tribal council, and I'm guessing 34 days in  from the way you've been talking at tribal, this is coming in very handy. <br/>I would have been going home tonight if I didn't have  this. <br/>Jeff: Really? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: Victoria, Gavin, Aurora, Lauren, Julie, after 34  days, somebody will be voted out tonight at tribal. Grab your stuff. See you. There congrats. It won't be you. <br/>Because I have the necklace, I'm safe now. I was target number one. They're going to go for Julie, who is the only person not in  that four, the only person who might be willing to work with me at all, so  I'm really hoping I'm going to find a way to keep her in the game. <br/>Would you like the talk? <br/>Would you like the talk in the family room? <br/>I would like the talk to Rick. I know I'm next on the list. So I think it only makes sense that Rick and I...  Well, you're the only one who will talk to me, so I would  love to talk to you. <br/>Even if he has something, he's not giving it to her, no  way in hell. <br/>Rick winning immunity sucks. I feel as though he is just that thorn in my side which will not  go away. <br/>It's all going to be fine. Julie is going to go home. <br/>I really do trust my final four. Because we can't get Devens out tonight, then the most logical  choice for the next vote is Julie. <br/>He's probably telling her right now maybe they'll vote for  Aurora or something like that. Maybe they'll flip and turn against her. <br/>Tonight we're going to vote for Aurora. <br/>Absolutely. I'm trying to figure out what they're going to do. I'm almost hoping that maybe they'll turn on Aurora on their  own. They might think I'm a better bet in the finals. <br/>Take the safe way out. <br/>They might take the safe way out and turn on her. I'm willing to work with Rick for the next vote, because I don't  really have many other choices, but I need more than just the two of us. Lauren is the only one I kind of -- if she reaches out to me, I  would have to put my whole life in Lauren's hands in terms of somehow swaying  them I'm a better pick to take to the end, but I don't know. I do have a good relationship with Lauren, but if Lauren votes  for Aurora, we're still going to need someone else to vote Aurora with her. Rick's probably going for Aurora, so I feel like I have to put a  vote on her. If anybody else wants to make that switch, I feel like I'm a  much better person for a final four. She has better potential to win immunity. She has a better chance at winning a fire-making chance. <br/>I see it. Moving forward with Julie means that I could possibly sit next  to her at the end, and I think I have a better chance of beating her than I  do Aurora. I think that Julie has become a very emotional player, and so I  don't think a lot of the jury likes Julie. I do not plan on putting my vote on you. I think I can convince Gavin. <br/>Okay. <br/>So I'm going to have to try to convince Gavin that his  best play is to not take Aurora to the end. This is the kind of thing where letting Julie go home looks  stupid to me. I say we vote Aurora. You're my number one, so if you don't want to do that --  I'd rather have vick in on it so she's not likely to flip  on us the next vote. <br/>If she shuts it down hard, do we still want to do it? <br/>We'll get it figured out. Let me talk to her first and we'll go from there. Lauren hit me with a conversation, do we really need to vote Julie,  the easy vote, or get out someone like Aurora, who is going to be a threat at  the fire-making challenge or just a threat to win that final immunity  challenge. <br/>I'm still down to vote Aurora. <br/>Okay. <br/>Lauren was ready to roll with it as long as I was. She didn't need Victoria's vote, but that concerns me, just  because I am close with Victoria. Moving forward, I want to make sure Victoria is in on this vote  and she's okay with it, because I don't want to rock the vote were it needs  to be rocked. <br/>It's either Julie or Aurora. Lauren thinks Aurora. <br/>I just think that's the wRong thing to do. <br/>I trust Lauren, but I'm with your 100%, because she was  willing to make the move whether you were on board or not. I said, new york I'm not doing it without vick. <br/>Lauren was ready to vote Aurora with or without me. Doesn't matter to her if I was on board. <br/>I do think she does want to go to the end with Julie  because she knows that's her best chance. <br/>If it's me and you, we can do what we need to. <br/>Now I feel like I'm in a bad spot, because at this point I  trust Gavin, but I believe Lauren is trying to work with so I just would  rather have Julie out of the game. <br/>I mean, if you and I come back here it will be a big  celebration. <br/>You're coming back here. <br/>I know, I know, I know. <br/>Julie is the only one who will work with me. I should do anything I can to keep her in the game. She's also someone that I wouldn't mind sitting next to in a  final three. So I'm going to have at least one were to tRicks up many I  sleeve to go along with my necklace. It gives me an opportunity to make a splash at tribal council  and maybe make this four-person alliance of Aurora, Lauren, Gavin, and Victoria  turn on each other tonight just to have them looking at each other like that  will further a smile on my face. The more confused they are, the better it is for me, because  when people are confused and paranoid this this game, they do crazy things. That's exactly what I need them to do. <br/>Jeff: We'll now wring in the members of our jury. <br/>Jeff: We'll now wring in the members of our jury. So Devens, you win immunity today and the first thing you say  is," I was going home tonight without it." what happened when you  got back the camp and you weren't going to be the one going home? <br/>There were some unhappy faces when I got back the camp. I think only myself and jelly were happy I won immunity today. I think plans got a little shuffled. <br/>Jeff: Julie, is that the feeling, that it's you and Devens  against the world? <br/>Absolutely. After the last tribal council where Ron got blindsided, it was  very clear there is a four-person alliance going on here that Devens and I  are not a part of. <br/>Jeff: What was the feeling for you at camp this afternoon  knowing Devens is safe? Was it just a shift to you? <br/>I mean, yeah. Nobody really wanted to talk to me today. So when we got back the camp, I immediately asked to speak to Devens,  because for me, I was completely on the outs. <br/>Jeff: Aurora, is that a known fact by everybody? <br/>It's very known. It's also known that I've been very vocal that I want Devens  out. I think he's played a great game. Anyone in this game will lose to him. And I will say the same thing tomorrow. I want him out. <br/>Jeff: Victoria, it's interesting that you can get laser  focused on one person. Is there any danger in that? <br/>I don't want to say that we're in the looking at the game  as a whole just by focusing on Devens, but he has played a good game, and his  winning has always come in clutch. I think it's a collective goal that Devens should go home. That's best for everyone's game. <br/>Jeff: Gavin, are you part of the "We" as well. Are are you all focused on Devens? <br/>Devens is the center of attention, because we keep getting  these opportunities to get him out and we can't make the most out of them. So it is frustrating in a sense, but in our defense, he's the  master of disguise. We've been trying to follow him around the make sure he's in the  finding other idols. <br/>I mean, he's everywhere all the time. <br/>He's literally hiding in trees. <br/>I was right behind Devens at one point, and me being the  idiot I am, I turned around and he was gone. <br/>Poof. I'm like kaiser sosa. <br/>He's a crafty fella. <br/>When they want me the most, they can't find me, meanwhile,  I can find a lot of interesting things. <br/>Jeff: Aurora, what do you read into that? <br/>I have learned not to listen to 90% of the things Devens  says, but I completely respect everything he is doing. He is out here giving 100%, and to me that just gives me more  energy to keep going after him. <br/>Jeff: Devens, there's a lot of attention on you, and  you're the one person who is safe. <br/>Thank goodness for that. But I'm getting frustrated, because there are four people that  have taken control of the game. Really it's three. Aurora, whether she wants to admit it or not, is clearly on the  outside, but anyway, I feel like tonight it's a great opportunity to try to  take some control. Because of that, I'm going to help out my friend Julie tonight,  and when the time comes, I'm going to play my hidden immunity idol that I did  find when people weren't following me! And then Julie andry going to vote together for vick, Gavin, Aurora,  or Lauren. So that's our plan tonight. Try to take back some control in this game. <br/>Jeff: Gavin, big statement. Devens pulls out something, says it's an idol and he's going the  play it for Julie and he's targeting one of the four of you. <br/>That is a big statement. I believe him. He's proved he's loyal to the people that back him up,  and...  Jeff: Nervous? <br/>How can you not be nervous? <br/>I'm definitely nervous. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, this is do-or-die time. Look around. There are only handful of people left. <br/>Yeah, it's just like the fear factor of it. He tells you one thing. He does another thing. And if I was him, why not? You get Julie on your side and you take someone out that you  don't want to sit by at the end. And so I don't feel as comfortable as I did walking in. It's still also an if. <br/>If it's an actual idol. It's in a red piece of paper which is the same color he pulled  out for the last one. In this tribal is over, I'm not taking anything for granted. <br/>Jeff: Gavin, it is interesting that fake idols can be  powerful, because you never know until it comes time to read the votes. <br/>Yeah, I think you take that into consideration and truly  how close are Devens and Julie? Does Devens need this idol for himself at the next vote? Because that would still leave a four against one. <br/>Jeff: I might say with the chance of something coming back  from distinction it would be 3-3. That could be a big move in this game. And if they want to bet a million dollars that I'm not going to  play this on Julie even though I already played one on David, then that's  fine, but it's a million dollar gamble. <br/>Jeff: Devens, this bravado that you're showing tonight, do  you think that was at all influenced by being voted out, sent to distinction,  having to fight your way back in, is there anything about this second chance  that has changed you? <br/>Oh, absolutely. I went out is so easily. I wanted to be a nice guy. You have time to think about it. Why didn't I fight harder? This time I'm playing with house money, and there is some  freedom being on the bottom and having nobody work with you. So now I'm just doing everything I can to better my position in  the game. And you need allies in this game. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Lauren, you're up. <br/>You're a cool girl who refuses to work with me. <br/>You're a cool girl who refuses to work with me. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. First vote Aurora. Julie. One vote Julie. Aurora. That's two votes Aurora. Aurora. That's three votes Aurora, one vote Julie. 14th person voted out and 11th member of our jury, Aurora. That's four. That's enough. <br/>How do you fall for this reverse psychology? Aurora, the tribe has spoken. Good game, guys. Good luck. Get him out. <br/>Still? Still? <br/>Dang. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on the season finale of  "Survivor," five are left, and one will return from the Edge of  Extinction. You each have one goal -- defeat everybody else. Who will outlast all the rest and claim the title of sole  "Survivor"? Join us for the finale next wednesday. <br/>It was so predictable, which I can't understand how anyone  fell for that. My plan is to get pumped up for the competition. It's either going to get me back in the game or it's going to be  my final "Survivor" challenge. <br/>Welcome to the edge. <br/>Miss positivity over here. <br/>It's been a long 30 whatever days.
