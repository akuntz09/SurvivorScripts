<br/>Jeff Probst: 36 days ago, 19 Americans were marooned off the rugged coast of  Fiji. The Moto Tribe won a luxurious camp with an elaborate shelter that was  stocked with food, supplies, and comfortable amenities. <br/>It's not even survival. It's thrival. <br/>Water! <br/>Just lick some leaves, man. <br/>Probst: But the Ravu Tribe struggled to survive on a beach with few resources. <br/>I never experienced dehydration like this. Half of us can't even stand up. It's crazy! We're starving here, bro! <br/>Probst: Moto... ...wins reward! ...the tribe of luxury, dominated in the challenges. Moto wins reward! First person voted out of Survivor: Fiji... In the beginning, the women took  the hardest hits at tribal council. Jessica, Erica, and Sylvia were the first to be voted out. <br/>I can't function like this. <br/>All right, Gary, I'm going to call in the medical boat and get you out of  here. <br/>Probst: Gary was the first man to leave when he fell ill...  One, two, three, lift. <br/>Probst: ...and was evacuated for medical attention. Fourth person voted out of Survivor: Fiji... At tribal council...  Wow. <br/>Probst: ...Liliana was next to go... Rita, the tribe has spoken. ...followed by Rita. Drop your buffs. <br/>What? <br/>Mookie. <br/>Probst: When the tribes were mixed, the new Ravu Tribe found itself with six  strong men and Lisi. Ravu was physically strong, but the luck of the draw sent them to live on the  beach with nothing. <br/>What do you guys think about me, you, Ed, Dreamz? <br/>Probst: Alex, Edgardo, Mookie, and Dreamz bonded together to form a  formidable alliance. <br/>All right. <br/>Probst: They called themselves the four horsemen. <br/>Right now we have to get nasty, and we have to use everything that we have. <br/>Probst: At the luxurious new Moto camp...  So we'll use that line. <br/>Probst: ...another alliance of four revolved around Earl and Yau-Man, and  included Cassandra and Michelle. <br/>It's all about the team. Who has all the power? That would be me. <br/>Probst: There were two hidden immunity idols, one at each camp. Mookie, Alex, and Edgardo found the hidden idol on Ravu. <br/>There's no words to describe how much this means to me in this game. <br/>Probst: They kept it secret from their tribe mates Lisi and Dreamz. And with Earl's help, Yau-Man found the one on Moto. <br/>This is my million dollars. <br/>Probst: Excluded from the core alliances, Anthony, Rocky, and Lisi... The  tribe has spoken. ...were quickly picked off. On day 22...  Look at that. <br/>Probst: ...the two tribes merged into one. Excited that they were moving to the Moto camp of luxury, they were shocked  to find everything gone. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, no! <br/>Probst: The stage was set for a battle between the two competing alliances. <br/>So the moment has finally arrived. I'm ready to fight. <br/>Probst: You will not be going back to camp. We're heading to tribal council right now. In a twist that sent Michelle to tribal council without her allies Earl,  Yau-Man, and Cassandra, she was voted off. The tribe has spoken. <br/>That just flipped the whole script around. <br/>Probst: The four horsemen had the upper hand. <br/>Unless I'm mistaken, the four of us are controlling this game right now. <br/>I didn't tell you, but we found the immunity idol on Ravu. <br/>Probst: But a revealing secret caused Dreamz to waver. <br/>We had a pact, and it kind of made me not trust them a little bit. So I'm going to trust them until I can't trust them no more. I'm not going to deceive y'all. <br/>Probst: In a bold move, Dreamz betrayed the four horsemen. <br/>Mookie's got an immunity idol. <br/>Cassandra wants me gone. <br/>Probst: Alex, sensing that he was in danger, asked Mookie for the protection  of the hidden idol. <br/>It's going to work, Mook. It's going to work. <br/>Mookie gave Alex the idol. <br/>Probst: But Dreamz informed Earl's alliance that now Alex had the idol. <br/>He gave it to him? <br/>I promise, I promise. <br/>Probst: So they switched their vote to Edgardo. <br/>If we hit them with Edgardo, that hits them from the left side. <br/>Probst: At tribal council, Alex confidently played the idol. Alex is immune from tonight's vote. But the votes for Edgardo spelled the end of the four horsemen. Edgardo, the tribe has spoken. The writing was on the wall, and Mookie and Alex were the next to go. On day 34, Yau-Man played hard and won a 2008 Ford Super Duty truck. And he continued to play hard when he immediately turned it into a bargaining  chip. <br/>Dreamz, how badly do you need that car? <br/>You know how bad I need a car, Yau-Man. <br/>I want to see if I can make a deal. There are six of us left now, right? <br/>Yes. <br/>When there are four of us left, if you and I happen to be one of the four, if  you win the immunity for that round, you will give it to me. <br/>I promise to God. <br/>Probst: So I want to be clear. You're saying, "I'll give you the truck."  Right. <br/>Probst: You can't enforce it. It's his word. <br/>It's his word. It's his word. His word is good. <br/>I give you my word, Yau. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man then strategically sent himself to Exile Island, where he  could read the clue for the rehidden idol. <br/>"If you're pining for treasure, it's within your reach."  Probst: Yau-Man, already in possession of one hidden immunity idol, gave Earl  the clue to the new rehidden idol, and Earl quickly found it. <br/>There you go. And we are in business. <br/>Probst: Boo saved himself when he won the next immunity challenge. Boo wins immunity! Finding a loophole in the truck[1]for-immunity  deal, Dreamz plotted to oust Yau-Man before the final four to avoid the  dilemma he might face later. <br/>I want to get rid of Yau today. Yau has an immunity idol. I give him mine idol at top four, so that puts him two spots up. <br/>Probst: But Yau-Man sensed danger. <br/>I have bad vibes. <br/>Probst: So at tribal council... If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and  feels they need to play it, now is the time to do so. ...in another strategic move, Yau-Man played the idol and saved himself. With just two votes against her, Stacy joined the jury. Now only five remain: Earl, Yau[1]Man,  Dreamz, Cassandra, and Boo. Will Dreamz win immunity and keep his word with Yau-Man? Find out tonight as they compete in their final immunity challenges, and one  outlasts all the rest to become the sole the rest to become the sole survivor. survivor. survivor. [ theme song playing] [ theme song playing]  Yeah. Tribal council was brutal tonight, lots of talk concerning my truck giveaway  and how that put a big target on my back. So I ended up using my hidden immunity idol, which was a good thing, because  otherwise I wouldn't have been here. <br/>You did what you were supposed to do, and you played the idol. I mean, it could have been just to flush the idol out. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Because they know that you have it. They're still not certain whether I have it or not. <br/>Right. Keep it that way. <br/>I always get suspicious when people don't tell me what they're doing. <br/>Right. <br/>That's the dead giveaway. When you don't tell me When you don't tell me anything.... anything.... <br/>They might try to target me, because now they know that I don't trust them. Obviously, it's time for me to protect myself. It's all about cannibalism now, It's all about cannibalism now, trying to eat  each other up. trying to eat each other up. trying to eat each other up. <br/>Two more days to go. <br/>Two more days to go. Here's one for you. <br/>Day 37 and five of us left, and because of my deal with Dreamz, I am probably  the biggest target. Because if they vote me out before final four, then Dreamz will not have to  renege on his public agreement with me. So what I need to do at this So what I need to do at this immunity challenge  is to win. immunity challenge is to win. <br/>We're thinking that you're standing with Yau, and now you're telling us that,  you know, you would have been down with whatever. <br/>That's where everybody's messing up. I've always said certain people in the top five. I never changed that. And we weren't at the top five. So I wasn't going to write down Yau's name, because that's going against my  word on what I gave Yau. And totally expected it. That's why I said I wouldn't have told him. I said it would have been to Yau to defend himself. <br/>Unfortunately, it does become a time in the game where you do have to look at  your own personal interests and cut your friends out. And I don't see any way that Earl is going to vote Yau or Yau's going to vote  Earl. So Dreamz, Boo, and myself, we're going to have to bond together while we  have the numbers to level the playing field. <br/>So whenever people try to be slick...  But does he have it? <br/>But does he have it? You said you'd be real with us. You said you'd be real with us. You said you'd be real with us. <br/>All right. <br/>All right. <br/>He has three clues. I mean, you know, he could have I mean, you know, he could have found it  pretty quickly. found it pretty quickly. <br/>If Earl has the hidden immunity idol and Yau-Man wins the immunity today,  we're in trouble. Definitely Dreamz, myself, or Definitely Dreamz, myself, or Boo will be going  home. Boo will be going home. Boo will be going home. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Sure. <br/>Probst: First thing's first. Boo, take back the immunity necklace. necklace. <br/>Always my favorite part. <br/>Always my favorite part. <br/>Probst: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will make your way through a massive, five-section  maze, and you will be doing so blindfolded. Here's how it works. Each of you will be wearing a uniquely shaped medallion. On my go, you'll negotiate the maze until you find a key station. Feel for the shape that matches your medallion. Retrieve your key. You must then find your way to the correct drawbridge. You're going to use your key to unlock the drawbridge, lower it, and then  cross over into the next section of the maze. If you get lost at any point, there are guide posts in each section that will  help you find your way. First person to get all five keys, cross all five drawbridges wins immunity,  will be in the final four. The rest of you, tribal council tonight. Somebody will be going home. Based on the last tribal council, I'd say everybody is equally vulnerable at  this point. We'll draw for colors. We'll draw for colors. We'll get started. We'll get started. Here we go, for immunity and a guaranteed spot in the final four. Survivors ready? Go! It is a long maze, nearly the length of a football field.

Boo, Cassandra, Dreamz, Earl, after 37 long days, somebody going home tonight. Should be a crazy afternoon. See you at tribal. See you at tribal. Head on back to camp. Head on back to camp. <br/>Well, I just won immunity. That guarantees my place in the final four. I cannot be voted out tonight. Earl has the other rehidden immunity idol, so he cannot be voted out. This was a very important win This was a very important win for me. for me. <br/>Okay. <br/>And we're at the final four, then we'll decided what to do. <br/>Oh, okay, all right, all right, we're good. <br/>We're good. <br/>All right, proud of you. <br/>Thank you. If everybody plays it straight, it will be Boo, unless Boo tries to make some  deals with other people. Boo, I'd like to say you are one of the strongest competitors I've ever met. <br/>I know that's why you're voting me out tonight. I understand. <br/>No hard feelings, okay? I know you play really, really... I mean, you don't give up, and I appreciate  that. <br/>I knew at the challenge, when I looked at it, what the writing on the wail  said. It read, "Boo, good game; it's It read, "Boo, good game; it's time  for you to go." time for you to go."  I'm voting Boo. <br/>I'm voting Boo. There's no... come on, now. There's no... come on, now. <br/>I don't need a heads-up before I leave. I don't care. You know what I mean? I'm a man. I feel I'm a man. I feel you're a man. Even when I leave tonight or tomorrow, I'm going to still say, "Yeah,  Yau-Man is the smartest man I ever knew. Yau-Man was one of the world's greatest fathers to me." And that's how I  see things. I wouldn't be surprised if I was voted out tonight, because people have been  lying and trying to blind-side people from the time we started playing this  game. So if they say they was going to vote Boo home and then vote me home, I  wouldn't be... that wouldn't surprise me at all. As a matter of fact, tonight is going to be the first night that I take all  my stuff to tribal council. <br/>Earl, can I talk to you for a  Earl, can I talk to you for a couple minutes? couple minutes? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>I can compete well against Yau. I think me and you together have a much better chance than one of us against  him, because he's good. <br/>Yeah, there's a better chance when it's you and me. <br/>That's what I'm saying. <br/>So my plea to Earl was to vote out Dreamz. Take me to the final three with you, Yau, and myself. I said you're guaranteed second when you go with Yau. You have an option to win a million if you go against me. That's a difference of $900,000. That's my plea. And either way you decide, I'll respect it. <br/>I'll definitely give it some thought. <br/>It's a decent option for Earl. It's a great option for me. If he takes it, he takes it, and If he takes it, he takes it, and I live to  play another day. I live to play another day. <br/>I'm always puzzled at this point. Boo proposed to vote out Dreamz. That would just be the smart thing for me to do. Everybody would want to go against Boo. You know, I'd rather go against Boo or Cassandra than go against Dreamz or  Yau-Man. Dreamz gets the sympathy vote, and Yau-Man gets the underdog vote. It's not about who I like and who I got alliances with. It's who can I beat in the final It's who can I beat in the final two. two. <br/>Well, do you think there's going to be one more challenge tomorrow? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>You believe that you think it's wise to bring Dreamz to the last challenge? Dreamz has a chance of winning a challenge, and he's definitely got a chance  at winning a vote. <br/>Sympathy vote. <br/>Huh? <br/>Sympathy vote. <br/>Oh, yeah. I think you'll win against everybody else but Dreamz. That's been my thought the whole way. So if you wanted to make a deal with me, I would definitely take second place  over fifth place. You'll win a vote against me. <br/>Boo's plan does sound enticing. I'm thinking through it. But to change from him to Dreamz, I need one more vote. <br/>So we're good, man. Good job today, man, getting that immunity. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Good job, because you know...  Good job, because you know...  Good job, because you know...  Uh-huh. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Tonight is going to be pins and needles night. I think I put myself again in a decent position, but it will be a little  nerve-racking until the a little nerve-racking until the votes are tallied up. votes are tallied up. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of the jury: Rocky, Lisi, Michelle,  Edgardo, Mookie, Alex, and Stacy, voted out at Alex, and Stacy, voted out at  the last tribal council. the last tribal council. Dreamz, with only five people left in the game, let's talk about threats. Are you more concerned about somebody who is a physical threat or somebody  who's not trustworthy and could betray you this late in the game? <br/>I'm more concerned about somebody who ain't keeping their word, because  anybody can win a challenge, you know what I mean? So I'm more concerned about somebody who don't keep their word. <br/>Probst: So that's got to be difficult to navigate at this point, because  keeping your word has not been the thing that's going on at tribal council  lately. <br/>It's a game for a million dollars. When it comes to just saying words, sometimes you've got to take a step of  faith. Sometimes you've just got to know your gut feeling. <br/>Probst: Earl, should this game couple down to the most deserving or  "Just as long as I can beat them"? <br/>Um, trust goes a long way, but at the very end, even your closest friend,  you'll still have that one little part of you that's like, "Well, I  might not be able to beat this person, so I might choose this person."  So it's a lot of careful thinking involved with this-- a lot. <br/>Probst: Boo, today's immunity challenge, Yau-Man wins, you get back to camp,  people start scrambling? <br/>I think I was the only one that suggested a few things, because I think that  Dreamz is going to be dangerous, and I'm a better candidate to take to the  final over Dreamz or Yau. Dreamz is popular. He'll get a sympathy vote also. I think Yau has worked hard. He hasn't made any enemies. So they're going to be very hard to beat in a vote. <br/>Let me say something. As far as being popular or whatever, I don't know if this is high school or  whatever, but as far as trying to get sympathy votes, you know, I tell people  my life story to show how far people can make it if they keep trying, not to  get no sympathy votes. <br/>I didn't say you were trying to get sympathy. I just said you will get a sympathy vote. <br/>But I'm just saying I don't do that for sympathy votes or anything like that. <br/>Probst: Make you a little uneasy when you hear Boo saying, "Dreamz is  popular, and Yau-Man is popular"? Because Yau-Man is wearing immunity. He's not going anywhere tonight. <br/>At this point, Yau-Man's got me as part of his top four strategy. That shows me that I'll at least be here probably until the top four if  everybody is doing what they said they're going to do, you know? <br/>Probst: So you're now taking the negotiation and throwing it back on Yau-Man,  because "I owe you in four, so you might as well keep me till  four."  Pretty much, or he did that all in vain. He did it all in vain if he throws me away. <br/>And I suggested it's probably time to get rid of Dreamz now instead of me--  no offense, Dreamz. <br/>No, I feel you. <br/>And I still think that would be the best thing. <br/>But if he stayed in the game, he might keep winning challenges. Now, he knows better than to take Yau, and Yau knows that. <br/>That would be up to Yau to make that decision. <br/>He would know better than to take Yau. <br/>I mean, I don't have any enemies, per se, but I don't have any friends on  that jury, you know? Dreamz is going to win by a landslide. Yau would win by a landslide. And I told Earl and Yau, if you want to guarantee that I will take you, then  I will guarantee you that if I win. I said, "I don't think anybody else is going to take you to the final  two."  Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol, tonight is the last time you can  play it. You would present it to me before I read the votes. Yau-Man you have the immunity necklace. Are you going to hang on to that? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: You cannot vote for Yau-Man. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Dreamz, you're up. Dreamz, you're up. Dreamz, you're up. <br/>It's just your time, bro. <br/>It's just your time, bro. <br/>It's just your time, bro. <br/>Gone, Dreamz. <br/>Gone, Dreamz. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Okay, if anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now is  the last time play it, now is the last time you can play it. you can play it. Earl is playing the last hidden immunity idol. All votes cast for Earl will not count. All right, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Boo. Dreamz. One vote Boo, one vote Dreamz. Boo. Two votes Boo, one vote Dreamz. 14th person voted out and the eighth member of our jury, Boo. That's three. That's enough. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Boo, the tribe has spoken. Boo, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. It's time for you to go. Well, you have made it to the final four. You have two days left in this game. Head back to camp. Try to get some sleep. Try to get some sleep. Good night. Good night. <br/>Well, night 37, and I've been voted out. Yau is a strong competitor. He's going to be a hard person to beat, and I respect him on many different  levels. It'd be funny if Dreamz still takes immunity and keeps it. I don't think he's going to break his word, but wow, there's going to be some  fireworks going to be some fireworks tomorrow. tomorrow. <br/>See how clear the water is. <br/>It's a nice, calm day. <br/>I'll never forget this big piece of rock here. I've been staring at it every afternoon. One more night. <br/>Yeah, just one more night. <br/>It's a great accomplishment, a great feat for me to make it to final four. This is quite amazing for me, when I think back all the things I went through  in Ravu 38 days ago and the hard times there, and now I'm at the final four,  really. <br/>Very nice, man. This is how it's supposed to happen, and this is what's happening. Yau and myself, we both have the same values and morals in life. Yau is a very, very nice guy, and him and I respect one another and admire  one another. And we sincerely know we're going to be friends for a lifetime. The older Chinese guy, the young black guy, friends, who'd have ever thought  that? That's like Rush Hour. <br/>Last full day on the island. <br/>I sealed my fate. My fate was sealed when I took the truck. <br/>And look what you got. <br/>I just want to do it in front of everybody. I just want my son see me as a man of my word. At a reward challenge, Yau won a truck. He gave me the truck in exchange of if I win immunity at four, I will give  him the necklace at tribal council. So today, winning the immunity challenge is very important to challenge is  very important to me. me. <br/>If I had known early how much the truck cost, I would have not been so fast  to make that deal. <br/>Yau-Man, that's what nobody understands. It's not just a truck. I seen a man who give away another something to another man that he don't  have. And it could have been strategy. It could have been whatever. But it helped me. My game plan is to give Yau the necklace, and whatever happens necklace, and  whatever happens tonight, I'm happy. tonight, I'm happy. <br/>A bone. <br/>Bone. <br/>A bone. <br/>A bone. <br/>"Congratulations, final four. You have done what 15 of your tribesmen and women could not do. Today, before proceeding to your final immunity challenge, you will honor  their memories. Get into your boat and follow the coast north to the river. Proceed up the river to the mangroves. There you will find the torches of your fallen comrades. As you collect them, remember these people and their time here in Fiji. Put the torches on the awaiting canoe, light them on fire, and reflect upon  them before sending the canoe out to sea."  Jessica, sorry you were the first to go. We hardly knew you. <br/>It sucks to be the first person voted off. But you also have respect, like, "Hey, they're playing the game."  This is what you all signed up for. <br/>Well, Erica. <br/>I came here to interact with people, to be strong, and I feel like when I  walked away, that there was nothing else that I could have done better, and I  could have done better, and I really felt good about that. really felt good about that. <br/>Sylvia, sorry that you had to go so early. <br/>I thought I did a pretty good job of suppressing my natural leadership  skills, but my tribe saw right through me and got to the heart of it, which  was I was a bossy son of a bitch. <br/>Big ups for Papa Smurf. <br/>Papa Smurf. <br/>For me, it was an absolute great experience. You know, it would have been better to go longer, but hell, I'm here at this  age. That's half the battle right That's half the battle right there. there. <br/>Liliana. <br/>I think the game Survivoris a powerful experience because it's like the real  world. I mean, just because someone's smarter or stronger in a business, at a  company, doesn't mean that they're going to be mean that they're going to be  the one promoted. the one promoted. <br/>Rita, Miss Venezuela, one of the best moms in the world. <br/>The main lesson that I want to teach my kids from this experience is that if  they have a goal or a dream, that they can stick to it and that they can make  it, no matter how hard or make it, no matter how hard or how impossible it  seems. how impossible it seems. <br/>Anthony, I wish you could be here longer with us. <br/>Even though people here have tried to put me down, I walk away from this a  better person and a stronger person. Hopefully, I'll be able to take this experience and turn it into this  experience and turn it into something better for my life. something better for my life. <br/>Hey there, Rocky boy, Mr. Boston. <br/>To be honest with you, a straight shooter like myself probably doesn't have  any business being in this game, you know?

I bet you never seen it coming. <br/>I'm a little bit disappointed that Dreamz messed me up in that vote, and you  know, we had a 50/50 chance, and it didn't work out. Hopefully things will work out for me in the future in the real for me in the  future in the real life. life. <br/>Mookie. <br/>This game is based upon the person next to you, and so it's a lot about  relying on your alliances, your friends, and trusting that they're going to  do what's in your group's best do what's in your group's best interest. interest. <br/>Alex, my brother for life. <br/>You know, I didn't make it to the end, but I didn't need to to know that I  can be a leader, I can be persuasive, I can motivate.

I'm going to make mistakes along the way. But I know, like, deeper than that, I'm adaptable, I'm resilient, and I have  a lot of resilient, and I have a lot of perseverance. perseverance. <br/>Boo. <br/>To win, that's a pipe dream. But to play so long and to receive all the rewards that I did in this  beautiful place, it was definitely a life-enhancing experience, and I'm  unbelievably experience, and I'm unbelievably thankful. thankful. <br/>Ready? <br/>Ready? <br/>All right. <br/>All right. <br/>All right. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to your final immunity challenge? <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Probst: First thing's first. Yau-Man, take back the immunity Yau-Man, take back the immunity necklace. necklace. For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs. Today's immunity challenge will test your threshold for pain and your desire  to win this game. For today's challenge, you will lie on a plank on your back with your arms  above your head, holding on to a wooden handle. The plank is elevated and at an angle. Every five minutes, I will increase the angle of the plank, making it more  and more difficult to hang on to. If that wasn't enough, water will stream out of a barrel down the plank,  making the plank slippery. When you've had enough, you'll let go of the handle, you'll slide down the  plank, into the water. Last person left hanging on wins immunity, is safe at tonight's tribal  council, and is guaranteed a spot at the final tribal council, because three  of you will face the jury and have a shot at the million dollars. Can't get bigger stakes than this. Everybody ready? <br/>Let's do it. <br/>I'm ready. <br/>Probst: We'll draw for spots. <br/>Probst: We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. We'll get started. Everybody good? All right, pull the rope, releasing the water. All right, this challenge is All right, this challenge is officially under  way. officially under way. This is a particularly interesting challenge for Dreamz and Yau-Man, going  back to the deal for the truck and the promise from Dreamz that he would do  his best to win immunity at four, and if he did, he would give it to Yau-Man.

Dreamz has won the last individual immunity. And in doing so, you have fulfilled part of the bargain you made with Yau-Man. The first part was you would do your best to win. The other part was if you did win, you would give it to him. Big question is now whether or not you'll keep your word. It should be an interesting afternoon back at camp. Grab your stuff. Grab your stuff. Head on back. Head on back. Head on back. <br/>Whew. <br/>Whew. <br/>Oh, okay. <br/>I really wanted you to get it. <br/>Yeah. That was a lot of pressure. <br/>I'm glad you did. <br/>A lot of pressure. <br/>I'm glad you did. Dreamz ended up winning the big immunity challenge today. I was glad you got it. The deal that Dreamz has with Yau is when there's four people left, if Dreamz  was to win the challenge, he has to give up his immunity necklace to Yau. Dreamz is definitely faced with an even tougher decision now, now that we've  been informed that it doesn't go down to a final two for the judging of the  million dollars. Now it's three people. So that means he could basically just save himself and go back on his word  and he has a chance at a million dollars. <br/>Gentlemen's honor. There's nothing that says he has to do it. But it's his heart. <br/>Nothing to worry about. <br/>Yeah. He's a good kid. <br/>And we're voting him out. <br/>Uh-huh. There is no reason for him not to stay on the straight and narrow, good path. narrow, good path. <br/>Wow. <br/>Wow. <br/>Why you saying if I change my  Why you saying if I change my mind? mind? <br/>This game... this game...  If you change your mind, would you not vote me too? <br/>Dreamz, I think he's really a man of his word, but from the very beginning,  when we brought him into our alliance, I think he was one of the biggest wild  cards. He seems a little bit out of control. But now he is in control, and he made a promise, and it worries me very much. I like this. I want this. I'm so close to getting this. I'm so close. <br/>So hard to give up a million dollars. <br/>I know. <br/>I worked hard to get here, lied, took out a whole alliance that I was...  Took out a whole alliance. <br/>I bowed down to a freaking car. <br/>You will... you will do the right thing. <br/>I want to do the right thing. <br/>I believe... I believe...  If I think of my kid before I go up there, believe the right thing's going to  happen. And I'm going to keep thinking about my kid, so... I'm just saying, just in  case, I'm just giving y'all a heads[1]up. If I do the wrong thing, y'all better vote Yau together, or one better vote  Yau together, or one of y'all is going home. of y'all is going home. If I was to give the immunity necklace for Yau-Man, in the game, it doesn't  benefit me at all. As a matter of fact, it eliminates me from the competition. I'm good with fourth. Fourth is good for me. This is my expectation. I'm good with four. You know what I'm saying? After the game, the benefits that I get of giving away the immunity necklace  is people knowing that I'm really who I say I am. I am an honorable person. I am noble. I am a truth teller. I am Dreamz. This is going to be one of the most difficult decisions I ever had to make  over $1 million or keeping my word. So $1 million or keeping my word, being honorable, or $1 million? I can use both of them. So I really don't know what I'm going to do tonight until it gets time to the  nitty-gritty gets time to the nitty-gritty and I have to do it. and I have to do it. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of the jury: Rocky, Lisi, Michelle,  Edgardo, Mookie, Alex, Stacy, and Boo, voted out Alex, Stacy, and Boo, voted  out at the last tribal council. at the last tribal council. First, a little bit of business. For the jury, today at the final immunity challenge, they were informed that  there would be three people at the final tribal council. Tonight, one person will become the ninth and final member of the jury. The remaining three will be back for the final tribal council to try to sway  you why they deserve a million dollars. Let's get to it. There's really only one topic to be talked about tonight, the negotiation  with Yau-Man and Dreamz. You guys made a deal. Dreamz said, "If I'm still here and I win the final four immunity, I  will give it to you, Yau-Man." Dreamz, you did win it. You're this close to having a shot at a million bucks. Do you start weighing your word versus this is a game? <br/>You know, in my head, I weighed it out, and this is a game of people lying,  people deceiving, people tricking people, but when your humanity side is  there, you forget all about that, and you try to do it according to your  friendships, you know? <br/>Probst: So where does humanity fall in this situation? When you were making the deal for the car, you really wanted the car. Now it's time to pay back. It's not so easy. <br/>Oh, no, it's not easy at all, because it's a million dollars, point blank,  you know what I mean? At the time, I really wanted the truck, and I still want the truck. You know, the truck is beautiful, and Yau-Man did that for me. But he did it out of strategy, you know? If I give Yau-Man the idle, I mean, I go home tonight. <br/>Probst: Okay, now, that seems like a big jump to take. There are a lot of scenarios that don't involve you being voted out. <br/>I pretty much know if I give Yau-Man the idol, I'm going to be voted out, but  I'm prepared for that. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man, let's get you in on this. Do you and Dreamz talk about this? Do you go up and say, "Okay, what's the deal? You going to give it to me? Because I'd like it now."  No, I just congratulated him on his win. I don't think he needs any encouragement or discouragement or any meddling on  my part, and I was wasn't going to do any campaigning. I left him alone to his own volition to decide. <br/>Probst: What's your gut telling you, Yau-Man, about whether or not Dreamz is  going to live up to this part of the bargain? <br/>Having known him for just a short time, my gut feeling is that he will live  up to his word. And I don't say that easily for other people. <br/>Probst: Cassandra, what do you think Dreamz should do? <br/>Um, Dreamz is in a difficult situation, and I agree that it was a gamble, and  I really can't even imagine being in his situation. <br/>Probst: Earl, did you have any conversation at all with Dreamz about this? <br/>No, we all pretty much just left him alone. I mean, it's such a difficult decision to decide between integrity or the  game. What's your priority? What matters to you the most as a person? <br/>Probst: What would do you? <br/>I don't think I would have been in this situation. <br/>Probst: So, Dreamz, your fear is that if you give Yau-Man the idol, you'll  then turn around and be voted out. <br/>I know if I give him the necklace, I'm gone. That's just all part of the game. But what we didn't know was that three of us was going to be talking to the  jury. That's what we didn't know, and that's what makes everything so down to the...  to the bone, Jeff. I can't even explain it. It's just one of the hardest things I ever have to do, and it sucks, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man, last chance before we go to the vote to say anything to  Dreamz. <br/>Well, Dreamz, I hope you think... thought it over, and I hope you live up to  your word, but you know, whatever you do, but you know, whatever you do, you  have to live with it. you have to live with it. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to get to one of the biggest votes of this  season. Before we do, Dreamz, you have the immunity necklace. It is yours to keep or to assign to anyone else you want. What are you going to do with What are you going to do with it? it? it? <br/>I'm going to keep it. <br/>I'm going to keep it. <br/>Probst: Dreamz is going to keep the immunity necklace. You cannot vote for Dreamz. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Earl, you're up. Earl, you're up. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. <br/>Probst: Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. council area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote, Cassandra. Yau-Man. One vote Cassandra, one vote Yau-Man. Yau-Man. Two votes Yau-Man, one vote Two votes Yau-Man, one vote Cassandra, one vote  left. Cassandra, one vote left. 15th person voted out and the ninth member of our jury, Yau[1]Man. Man. Bring me your torch. Bring me your torch. Yau-Man, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. It's time for you to go. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Probst: Well, after 38 days, you've gone as far as you can go in this game. The power now shifts to the jury. Tomorrow, they will decide which one of the three of you they feel is most  deserving of the million dollars and the title of sole survivor. You have one more night here in Fiji. Enjoy it. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Well, sorry, Dreamz. You did not see fit to live up to your end of the bargain. Enjoy the truck. I am very surprised that Earl voted me out today. He must have his reasons for it. I don't understand why, but I'm glad I could hold my own, and to make it this  far is quite an accomplishment, and I'm very accomplishment, and I'm very  proud of it. proud of it. <br/>It is a game. It was just a game. That's it. How you feeling, Earl, big Earl, now? <br/>I'm good. <br/>That's right. <br/>That's right. Everybody's good. Everybody's good. <br/>That jury is going to rip me up real nice too. <br/>They're going to look like I turned on Yau big time. Dreamz made a very surprising decision. He decided not to give Yau the immunity idol. He decided to go back on his word. <br/>This ain't nothing like I am at home. It hurt me. It hurt me tonight to have to do that, but I knew if I didn't do it, I'd be  on the jury right now, with no chance at all of winning a million dollars. <br/>When it all went down, I actually was pissed. You know, in the back of my mind, I said, "Man, I can't believe I'm  actually writing down Yau-Man's name, who's trusted me, and I've trusted him  through this whole game." So that was pretty difficult. Yau-Man, him and I have been through a lot, and I would hope that, you know,  on that jury I still have his vote, that he won't hold it against me, and he  knows I was just playing the game. <br/>Well, we're still here, to the bloody end. The decision tonight that I made with Yau is not going to be weighing on my  mind. I have no regrets. I think I did everything the right way, like I was supposed to. I planned it out step by step, and I have no regrets. I think everything worked out I think everything worked out perfect. perfect. Like I said, I take it back to the old concept of it's a game, and everybody  else lied and cheated and slithered their way through the game, biting each  other, snakes, rats, weasels. So it's not going to play on my mind. I'm just going to sleep comfortable tonight, knowing that I got a shot at a  million that I got a shot at a million dollars tomorrow. dollars tomorrow. <br/>Day 39, last day, and we're all still here. <br/>We're ecstatic. <br/>Ecstatic. <br/>Ecstatic, that's our word. <br/>Ecstatic. <br/>So I'm putting the smiley face on now. We figure by 39, we deserve a big smile. We have spent 39 full days in the same underwear. <br/>The same funk. <br/>In the same funk. I discarded my underwear, though, about three weeks ago. <br/>This is the last day on this island, game over, and I'm island, game over,  and I'm happy. happy. The plan for today is to relish in the moment, and we're celebrating just by  being happy. You know, we don't have a lot of energy to do cartwheels and jumping jacks  and run around the island. We just don't have the energy for that. But occasionally we look at each other and just nod like, "We did  it."  Food! <br/>No, it's not. <br/>A mirage! <br/>No, it's not. <br/>No, it's not. Ah! Ah! <br/>Whew! <br/>Whew! <br/>Whew! <br/>Day 39. <br/>Day 39. <br/>Big deal. <br/>A pretty big deal. <br/>"Take a deep breath and sigh, then use these tools to celebrate when  some gifts fall from the sky." Whoo! <br/>Look it. <br/>Look it. <br/>Ooh, yes! <br/>Ooh, yes! <br/>Right here. <br/>Over here. <br/>Over here. [ Cassandra yelling] [ Cassandra yelling]  Dreamz, come on! Dreamz, come on! Hm. <br/>He missed the x. <br/>He's lucky I can't swim. I'd get out there and get that. All right, big papa, bring back the food. <br/>I'm going to get the food. I got to feed my family. <br/>I can't believe, as hungry as I am, there's some food in the ocean, floating. I said they're lucky I can't swim. I'd put on those fins, and that I'd put on those fins, and that would be here  by now. would be here by now. <br/>Huh? <br/>I look forward to everything and the wonderful breakfast amongst my three...  my... what are we, the three what? <br/>Amigos. <br/>Three amigos. <br/>We're the three amigos. We were the core four. Now we're the three amigos. <br/>So I am feeling really excited. We're celebrating, but I just feel very grateful that I made it this far. I made it with some great people, Earl and Dreamz. <br/>My mother would be so embarrassed. <br/>She will be when she sees it. <br/>Drinking syrup out of a champagne glass and eating strawberry jam right out  of the jar. <br/>I mean, we're all very excited and happy to have played the game and made it  through the game. After all, I was the one that couldn't swim, not very athletic, the older  lady. So I felt initially like odds were definitely stacked against me, but I'm  still here. <br/>We turned this mother out. <br/>We are making an exit bonfire before we go to tribal council. All these palm fronds I had to sleep on, burned. <br/>Burned. <br/>All this stuff, burned. <br/>Burned. <br/>That log, burned. <br/>Burned. <br/>Even this case, this wooden case with the food in it, even though that was  good, burned. <br/>Burned. <br/>Everything gets burned. <br/>Everything must go. It's a liquidation sale. Everything must go. Everything must go. <br/>It's a fire sale. <br/>It's a fire sale. <br/>I think being homeless helped me through this whole situation of roughing it. <br/>Yeah, let it burn. <br/>And actually having a shot at a million dollars, me, myself, and how my whole  family grew up, this is more than words can explain. It's... it's too... it's just crazy. <br/>Somebody's dirty draws. I don't know who they belong to, but that's really got to burn. <br/>Burn. And now I feel that it's over. I feel that it's over. It's the last day. The struggle is over. The pain is over. The game is over. So right now I feel that I am on top of the world. I feel that... I feel like I'm I feel that... I feel like I'm standing next  to Oprah. standing next to Oprah. <br/>I'm pretty proud of myself for making it this far. This is one of the highest peaks of my life, because I've challenged myself  so much in this game, and I made it all the way through, just as planned. I mean, it's a cool experience. You won't know until you do it, till you give up everything and your  lifestyle and come here and get in the dirt and the mud and the grind and  make it happen, still be yourself, be strong, see what you're made of, see if  you're really a man, or a woman-- the experience of a woman-- the experience  of a lifetime. lifetime. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in your jury: Rocky, Lisi, Michelle, Edgardo, Mookie,  Alex, Stacy, Boo, and Yau-Man, voted Stacy, Boo, and Yau-Man, voted out at  the last tribal council. out at the last tribal council. Welcome to your final tribal council. You have outlasted 16 other people in this game. Now the power in this game shifts from the three of you over to the jury. Nine people that you had a hand either directly or indirectly in voting out  of this game now hold your fate in their hands. Tonight, they will decide who they think is most deserving of the title of  sole survivor and the million dollars that goes with it. Here's how it's going to work. You will each get a chance to make an opening statement. This is your opportunity to convince the jury that you are the person most  deserving. The jury will then get a chance to address you. After hearing everything that's been said, we will get to the final vote. Let's get started. Opening statements. Earl. <br/>Um, well, first I want to say hello, good to see everybody. About me, I played an honest and clean game. I know there's been talk of rats and snakes in this game, but that just  didn't work for me. I didn't want to be that. So I tried to take the hard way, which is just try to make the right moves  and put myself in the right position to where I didn't have to sacrifice a  lot of integrity. If you think about it, I was somebody, no one ever wrote my name down to get  voted off, and I never had to win an immunity challenge, and I'm here in the  finals. So I think that says a lot, that I played a pretty intelligent game, very  smart, and now I'm here, and hopefully... and you know, I don't want the  sympathy vote or underdog vote. I want the respect vote. You know, I just feel I'm very deserving of this, and I hope that you guys  feel that way too. <br/>Probst: Cassandra. <br/>Um, I just first want to say thank you to everyone on the jury. I started the game pretty slow, not really feeling like I was in the hub of  it, but I wanted to make sure that throughout the game that I made everyone  feel like they had someone they can come talk to, that they can befriend. And I was fortunate enough to get with an alliance and stay firm. I never wavered. I tried to stay as positive as possible throughout the whole game, and I'm  hoping that people can respect that, and I just hope, at the end of the day,  that we can all still be friends. <br/>Probst: Dreamz. <br/>Well, I ain't going to make this as long. I'm just going to get to the point. I'm sure everybody knows my life story, because I opened up to everybody, just  to see who would open back up, not for the game strategy, because I was,  like, getting to know people. And the people that I did get to know, y'all know me. Y'all know my heart. Y'all know what I'd do with the money. Y'all know everything about me pretty much, because I wear it on my chest. And I hope y'all vote count and helps me and helps my life and helps me help  other people. <br/>Probst: All right, jury, in a moment, you're going to get your first chance  to address Earl, Cassandra, and Dreamz. I'll give you a minute to think I'll give you a minute to think about what  you want to say. about what you want to say. <br/>Probst: Okay, jury, you're now going to get your first chance to address  Earl, Cassandra, and Dreamz. You can address any of them or all of them. It's up to you. It's up to you. Michelle, get us started. Michelle, get us started. <br/>All right, well, you guys already made your personal statements, and after  all that, this is a little bit more objective. I was just wondering what you think was the biggest hardship and obstacle  that you were faced with, you know, whether it be sleeping in the dirt or  starving, because I think you have to work pretty hard for a million bucks. So, Dreamz? <br/>Sleeping in the dirt, starving, that's really nothing to me, because I grew  up having to do that. So that was just something that I have to repeat in my life. I think the hardest thing was thirst. You know, you could be hungry as you want to be in the city, but there's  always water somewhere, out of the... you know what I mean?-- out of the  faucet. So being thirsty and then having to do challenges, that was the hard part for  me. <br/>Okay. Cassandra, what do you think the hardest thing that you had to go through was? <br/>The biggest obstacle for me being in Survivorwas overcoming my inability to  swim. For me, that was my biggest obstacle in the game. <br/>Do you think your fear of water earns you a million dollars? <br/>You know, the combination of my fear of water and really opening myself up to  people and forming an alliance, that was an obstacle for me, too, initially. <br/>Okay. Earl? <br/>Being the only original Ravu member up here, everybody who was at Ravu knows  about suffering-- no water, no food, and still pushing yourself, pushing,  pushing, pushing. Then you get sent to Exile Island, and that's total suffering. So I've suffered more than anybody, I think, as far as that, but I got  through it. <br/>All right. Thanks, guys. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Michelle. Edgardo. <br/>All right. I have one question. This question is for Earl. Earl, how do you found out who had the immunity idol from the had the  immunity idol from the other alliance? other alliance? other alliance? <br/>Dreamz. <br/>Dreamz. <br/>That's it. <br/>Probst: Mookie. <br/>Positive light, congratulations to you three for making it this far, first. Second, Dreamz, did you tell anyone about the immunity idol that I found? <br/>Yes, I did. <br/>Would you consider that betrayal? <br/>No, I'd say it's lying. <br/>So that's not betraying your alliance? Telling the biggest secret of an alliance to another alliance, you don't  consider that betrayal? <br/>Well, if that's how you consider betrayal, I guess it's betrayal in your eyes. To me, it's just a lie. It's just a con. It's just a deceit and...  Okay, okay. Word of advice for you guys, tonight is not the time to lie, and tonight is  not the time to get caught up in a lie. So just a word of advice for you guys. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Mookie. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Mookie. Alex. Alex. <br/>Okay. Cassandra, please describe a moment that you grappled the most with  maintaining your integrity. <br/>Um, I think the biggest struggle I had with my integrity was once, in the  beginning of the game, I walked in on a conversation you had with Boo, where  it involved me, and I had to really decide if I was going to stay there and  listen or if I would walk away. <br/>Can you describe to me the conversation? <br/>It was basically discussing eliminating me or Dreamz. <br/>One of two things is going on, Cassandra. One, you're lying to me right now, and that was not, in fact, the moment you  struggled with most, or two, you cared very little, taking Stacy, pretending  to like her, comforting her and nurturing her to use her vote to then quickly  discard her when she was no longer of any use to you, not two votes later. So which is it? <br/>Well, basically, I think you have the situation wrong, and hopefully Stacy  can clarify it. <br/>Stop, stop, stop, stop. No, stop, I get to talk. <br/>You didn't let me finish. <br/>It doesn't matter, Cassandra. <br/>Stacy...  I have enough information. <br/>No, I think that, you know, I should be able to respond to your question. <br/>No, I think you're mistaken. You are mistaken, Cassandra. I said stop talking. <br/>Well, Stacy came to me, and she asked me...  Is that not clear to you, Cassandra, that I said stop talking? Maybe I should say it in Spanish. Edgaro, you want to translate? No, I think we're good. Stop talking. On to Dreamz. Given that you said specifically your goals are to help kids, explain to me  this, riddle me this, Dreamz. You cheat, you lie, you back[1]stab  to succeed. Why would the rats and the snakes be the role models to the kids you and I  are trying to help? Explain to me why I would endorse that view if the world? <br/>Because it's part of the game. This ain't part of the real world. This is.. there's two separations. This is this game. This game is based on cons, lies, and deceit. The real world, you do that stuff, and you end up paying the consequences. <br/>All right, fair enough. Well, I would wish you luck, and unlike you, I'm a man of my word, so I don't  wish you any luck at all. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Can't hide from karma  Can't hide from karma forever, "my friend." forever, "my  friend." forever, "my friend."  Probst: Lisi, you're up. <br/>Probst: Lisi, you're up. <br/>Whew. All right, let's see. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a liar by the toe. If he hollers, let him go-- not really. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. Cassandra, can I see your water shoes? <br/>Sure. <br/>All right, those are the worst-looking water shoes I've ever seen. It's just telling me that you were completely unprepared to play this game. Would you agree with that? <br/>No, it's day 39, and I'm still here. These shoes are still here, and you know...  Okay. <br/>That's all I can say. I don't see the relevance in the question. <br/>I brought up the shoes because you were in over your head. So I'm thinking for 39 days, she made it because... greed. I think greed is what really fueled everything. Would you agree with that, yes or no? <br/>No, I don't agree with that. I mean, I'm not surprised to hear that comment from you. My purpose for being on the island was to prove some things to myself. <br/>So greed never propelled you? <br/>Greed never propelled me. <br/>So what did? What did, your love of the outdoors? <br/>Of course wanting to win a million dollars, like everyone. <br/>Ah, oh-- what? <br/>And... but it wasn't that I sat there every day...  Say that... say that one more time. <br/>We're all here for the million dollars, but I didn't think every day of the  game I'm willing to do anything for the million dollars...  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. We're playing. <br/>...which is my definition of greed. <br/>We're playing. Dreamz, I want to know how many zeroes there are in a million. <br/>Six, enough to keep somebody's life running and to help a lot of people. <br/>Say that one more time. <br/>Enough to keep somebody's life running...  No, no, the number of zeroes. <br/>It's six. <br/>Good, good. Okay. <br/>Do you think I'm stupid? Let me ask you that question. <br/>No, no. No, no, hey, it's a question. I'm part of the jury. This is part of my game. <br/>Okay, go ahead. <br/>Just like you played your game, and you do what you have to do with the game,  I get that opportunity too. Okay, Earl, yesterday, when Yau got voted off, you did a whole show for the  jury. I saw it. You... that did... you gave me that look, that look, that look of "Oh, I  can't... I can't believe this has happened." I want to know why you  looked so shocked after you voted the man off. <br/>I was shocked when Dreamz didn't give up the immunity idol. And then that put me in a situation, and I voted Yau out. And I just sat there like, "Wow, Yau is gone. Like, the person that was there with me the whole time, he's gone."  You could have voted off Cassandra. <br/>"We're at that part of the game."  You could have vote off Cassandra. <br/>...the game, but I didn't. It was a choice. It was a smart choice. <br/>It's amazing how smart becomes interchanged with lying and manipulate. That's it. I'm done. All right. All right. <br/>Probst: Stacy. <br/>Probst: Stacy. <br/>Wow, you guys made it 39 days. Congratulations. Earl, the only real difference that I see between you and Dreamz is that  you're a little more sophisticated. You're college educated. Once you leave this game, you're going to land on both of your feet. Dreamz, this could change your life, you know? Earl, I want to know whether I should base my vote on a need basis or not. You know what I'm saying? <br/>We wouldn't even be playing this game if we didn't all need a million dollars. I mean, a million dollars would change his life, Cassandra's life, and my  life as well. I mean, I'm not supposed to feel bad because I have a job. I'm not supposed to feel bad because I had a car. I had a tough upbringing, and I worked hard. I was raised by a single mom. There was drugs in my family. There was violence. There was everything. And that's why I feel like it shouldn't be based on need. It's just how you played the game. And we all need it. We all need it. Does that answer your question? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Stacy. Rocky. <br/>All right, boys and girls, this is how it's going to work-- one question,  everybody's going to answer it. How did you manipulate the best? Because everyone here did it, did it a little bit better. I know some of you are familiar with my vocabulary. The word "kicker" is going to come into play today. Kicker is a, you know, clutch player and/or best player. You answer the question for me: I am the biggest kicker because of... And  then we go like that, and on and on we go. Cassandra, we don't really know each other that well. You're going to go first. And then, after you'll done, I'll pick somebody else. <br/>I'm the biggest kicker because I feel that I listened to a person at a time  when they really needed someone to listen to, someone that they could get  some positive feedback. <br/>I don't really want to know about the positive things you did, the nurturing,  the burping, nothing like that. I'm going to give you one more chance. If you can't do it, I'm going to go with somebody else, and then we'll go  from there. So second shot. <br/>You know, honestly, Rocky, I don't feel that I've manipulated a person in  this game. <br/>All right, Dreamz, so same question. <br/>I'm the biggest kicker because I manipulated my way to the top. Every time I was on the chopping block, I was able to turn it around and put  somebody else on there by laying low for little while. I think I manipulated Yau, you know...  Obviously. <br/>...into keeping me around, because I was on the chopping block. You know, so I had to manipulate Yau to get his protection. You understand? <br/>That was an answer. You see? But that was... I mean, that was... I like that. My man, Earl. <br/>I have to be one of the biggest kickers because I think I manipulated  probably everybody up there, because no one thought I was even playing the game. <br/>That's a decent answer too. I'm done. Nice move, brother. All right, good luck. <br/>Probst: Boo, you're up. <br/>Wipe the smiles off your face, boys and girls. First of all, I want to tip my hat off to this man, Yau. I think, by far, he was the greatest all-around player. He relied on this man's word. Dreamz didn't come through. You can't make a promise in your heart and then say, "Oh, well, I change  it now."  It wasn't in my heart, brother. <br/>Dreamz, I'm speaking. You will have another chance to refute what I said. <br/>Go ahead, go ahead. <br/>When you made that deal with Yau, were you playing him as a game, or did you,  as a Christian-- and I'm coming to you as this because I believe in you as a  Christian; I want to know your Christian answer. Were you playing him when you accepted that truck, or did you come back later  and say, "You know what?-- I got to play the game now; this is my  chance"? <br/>I came here to play the game. I started getting these friends, all these new friends, which really  flustered my mind. I was just happy to be around people. So it took my mind off the game plan. I wasn't even strategizing. I was just following people's strategy. <br/>Were you playing the game? <br/>I was playing the game. <br/>As a Christian man, I want your Christian word. <br/>I was playing the game as a person. <br/>When you accepted his truck deal, were you making that as the game, or were  you making that because you wanted the truck? <br/>You don't know. You don't know what's on the inside. I was playing the game. And either it was going to be me or him, and I thought about it right here,  sitting in this chair. What would everybody else do? Would everybody else give their chance up for a million dollars? <br/>Okay, Dreamz, my opinion, it was a good try, but I see straight through it. And I still believe in you, but I still believe you're an immature Christian. And I hope that one day you will be a strong Christian man and be able to  tell the devil, "Dangle all the money you want in front of me; this  Christian is not for sale." I just want to say, one more time,  congratulations to each and every one of you. and every one of you. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man. <br/>First of all, a personal statement. Being a 54-year-old man, I have the advantage of not having testosterone  overload and, therefore, testosterone poison the brains. I can admit to a mistake. Dreamz, what went down yesterday was entirely my fault. The truck was given to you in good faith. Enjoy it. Do not feel guilty about having it. <br/>Thank you, Yau-Man. <br/>So now I'm going to give you a chance to have the gonads to stand up and say  why you changed your mind. <br/>Yau-Man, I didn't change my mind. I didn't change my mind. I was playing the game, Yau-Man. And you can say it yourself, I played a heck of a game. It's outplay, outwit, outlast, and I think I did that. Yau-Man, you just... I'm sorry that you was victim. <br/>And so when you accepted the truck, you were basically playing me at that  time. <br/>But still, Yau-Man...  And when you shook my hand...  You remember the whole thing was a game. You was the hardest player of the game, so you should have never forgot that  we were playing a game-- never forgot that. <br/>Understood. So you are not going to admit you changed your mind. <br/>Yau-Man, I would admit it if I would have changed my mind, but I came here  knowing what I was going to do. <br/>Thank you. Thank you. <br/>So, Earl, a simple question: why would you not want to take me to the next  level? <br/>The reason why I would not want to go against you, because I would not win. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Because you played the best game by far. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Yau-Man. Been a lot said, a lot for you guys to take in. Earl, Cassandra, Dreamz, good luck. Jury, I'm going to give you a minute to think about everything that's been  said tonight, and then we will get to the final then we will get to the final  vote. vote. <br/>Probst: Okay, jury, tonight you are voting for a winner.

Rocky, you're up. Rocky, you're up. Rocky, you're up. I'll go get the votes. I'll go get the votes. Congratulations to all of you for going as far as you did in the game.

All right, Earl, Cassandra, Dreamz, I just said it a second ago, but I want  to say it again, congratulations on going as far as you can go in a very  difficult game, a game that requires you to vote people out in a way that  allows you to then turn around and come back and say, "Give me a million  bucks." Not easy to do. One of you has been successful. The other two have not. The jury has made its decision. Let's find out what it is. There are nine votes in here.
