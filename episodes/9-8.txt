<br/> <br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: At Lopevi, the tribe  had enough of John's lazy attitude.  <br/>He's the kind of person that coasts through the  game.  <br/>Yeah, he is.  <br/>He's not coasting through this game with us.  <br/>No.  <br/>At Yasur, Rory attempted to break into Ami and Leann's  alliance.  <br/>I need to know where you guys stand with regards to  me.  <br/>What happens when the merger comes with the men?  <br/>I don't give a ... about them men. I know you guys a lot  better than I know them.  <br/>Unfortunately for you, the fact that the women had this  alliance excludes you.  <br/>At the reward challenge, Lopevi got an unexpected  surprise. Lisa voted out at the last Tribal Council.  <br/>I thought for sure that they would have gotten rid of him,  keep the women together.  <br/>Probst: Survivors ready, go! After a nerve-wracking  challenge that tested the survivors' steadiness, it was Yasur that walked  away with victory. Yasur wins Home Cafe reward. And a little taste of  home.  <br/>Whoa!  <br/>Guys, look, pictures. Me and my sisters.  <br/>Oh.  <br/>This is our first Halloween together.  <br/>Oh.  <br/>Oh.  <br/>Coffee, croissants, and we got letters from home.  <br/>To love and to family.  <br/>Probst: Though emotions brought the tribe  together...  <br/>I'm really happy right now.  <br/>Probst: ...Rory kept his guard up.  <br/>Even though this is a loving moment, and we're bonding, I  ain't forgot where they put me.  <br/>Probst: At Lopevi...  <br/>Would you like to join me?  <br/>Probst: ...Twila and Julie plotted to stick together and  keep their options open.  <br/>I don't have any loyalties to the women.  <br/>I don't, either.  <br/>I just think the guys are gonna shaft us whenever they get  a chance, but little do they know...  <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, Rory knew he had to  come through, and he did, sparing himself and his tribe mates a trip to  Tribal Council.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Yasur wins immunity! ( cheering )  <br/>Whoa. Whoa!  <br/>Probst: Back at camp, there were mixed emotions over the  win.  <br/>I'm really glad that we won, but at the same time, I  looked over at Lopevi, and it hurt to know that either Julie or Twila are  going home tonight.  <br/>Probst: At Lopevi, John was on the chopping block until  Chad questioned Julie's loyalty.  <br/>I'm not comfortable with Julie staying with us,  dude.  <br/>Well...  <br/>If we merge, she's gonna go right with the women.  <br/>Probst: And John targeted Chad.  <br/>Chad-- he gets the sympathy vote, and if it ever came down  to him and one of us in the final two, he'd get it in a heartbeat.  <br/>Probst: But at Tribal Council, Julie and Twila dodged the  vote when the guys trusted the women's loyalty and voted out John. John, the  tribe has spoken. Ten are left. Who will be voted out tonight? ( theme song  playing )  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Oh, yeah.  <br/>We stay five, we're solid. We go to the end.  <br/>What happened at Tribal was a wonderful thing... ( laughs  ) ...'cause I thought I was going home. Temporarily, I'm still here, so I'm  psyched.  <br/>Are you sure you guys don't want any manioc?  <br/>I'm good.  <br/>I don't want any, and I'm-I'm fine.  <br/>We're sitting around the fire, and Julie just sits down  between my legs and-and gets warm. And I was like, whoa.  <br/>Really good.  <br/>You know what's going to be so satisfying? The women  seeing us.  <br/>Oh, definitely.  <br/>Yeah, they're gonna know we're with you guys.  <br/>I thought it was interesting at first, but no big deal,  she's cold. But then, once the fire started blazing, she just stayed there  and kind of snuggled in closer, and Sarge was just kind of letting it happen.  ( laughter )  <br/>You see that?  <br/>I know. When she snuggled up with you?  <br/>I was, like, that's hot.  <br/>I know, man.  <br/>She's just wanting to solidify another three days.  <br/>Totally, man.  <br/>Sure.  <br/>Like, remember Ginger on Gilligan's Island?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Hello.  <br/>Oh, hell, yes, Julie is using her sex appeal and her young  age and her body, trying to get next to the men. There's no doubt about it.  Not much I can do about it. She's 22 years younger than I am.  <br/>You know, Julie's fine, she's hot, you know? She's a  model. I mean, I really don't hang out with too many young, 22-year-old  models, you know?  <br/>Do it.  <br/>You're not offending me. Bare the ass.  <br/>Julie is, like, "You know, you look good. You ought  to expose your body some more." And I said, "What the  hell?"  <br/>I see it. ( Twila laughs )  <br/>Yeah, that's a white ass.  <br/>Ow, that's a white ass. We all three ought to do it and  slide next to Sarge. ( Twila laughs )  <br/>Mine's white, too.  <br/>Julie is an exhibitionist. I mean, she's comfortable with  it. And I told 'em, I'm comfortable with it, because I've been in  Europe.  <br/>Uno, dos, tres.  <br/>Ah!  <br/>Sarge... ( Twila laughs )  <br/>Sarge, what are you doing?  <br/>What are you doing?  <br/>I just glanced over there. Sarge has his ass hanging out.  Probably is an image that will never leave my memory. Julie is a bad  influence! ( laughter )  <br/>Oh.  <br/>Seriously, there is nothing going through my mind of,  like, this is going to keep me solid, but, hey, if those boys want to keep me  around strictly for visual stimulation, well then, hey, I got it in the bag  then, right? ( cawing ) ( screeching ) ( birds singing )  <br/>If Scout and I stopped working, this camp literally would  stop. Leann and Ami and Eliza should be disgusted with themselves. Their main  activity for the day consists of waking up late and then sitting on their  asses for the rest of the day, and I'm tired of it. ( Ami sighs )  <br/>Is coffee ready to go?  <br/>I don't know, but it's starting to really hurt to  sleep.  <br/>Leann gets up, and she's a little crabby. She's got coffee  right there, she's got water boiled, and she's got plantains ready to eat,  and she's crabby.  <br/>Rory, you'd better get over here and get some of the  breakfast you cooked.  <br/>Yeah, I'll be over there in a second.  <br/>Wait. All that water? Yuck.  <br/>You don't like the water?  <br/>Uh-uh. No.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>That doesn't taste good at all.  <br/>What a worthless crew. What a completely worthless crew.  Stupid people irritate the living hell out of me. Eliza-- she's like a little  kid.  <br/>All right. Let's try and move the fire.  <br/>I have personally taught Eliza at least four or five times  how to make a fire. Come over on the side and push everything that way. And  she's still struggling with boiling a pot of water!  <br/>I don't know how it was... earlier.  <br/>And I think Ami is just taking advantage of everybody. Ami  is just riding her little queen role, and I'd really like to knock her ass  down a peg, quite frankly. I'm ready to get the hell out of Yasur. I really,  really, really want to be around some men. I'm tired of these women. I'm  tired of 'em.  <br/>Probst: Yasur, getting your first look at the new Lopevi  tribe. John voted out at the last Tribal Council. ( sigh )  <br/>Probst: What was that reaction for, Scout?  <br/>I'm just so happy to see Twila. I had a dream last night  that Twila had to go home, and she was crying, and I was crying, and... Whoo!  Yeah!  <br/>Twila ain't going nowhere.  <br/>Probst: Scout, Sarge clearly took that as a sign that you  think Twila is part of a women's tribe.  <br/>Well, he can think whatever he wants to think. I'm just  glad to see her.  <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?  <br/>ALL: Yes.  <br/>Probst: It is for reward, and you're going to get wet.  You're going to compete tribe versus tribe in a relay-style race. Each tribe  member will take a spot at one of five stations. The first tribe member will  pick up a bucket, race down to the ocean, fill it with water, race back to  the mat. They will then toss the bucket with the water in it to the second  tribe member who will toss it to the third tribe member who will toss it to  the fourth tribe member. That person will take whatever water is left in the  bucket, while holding onto the bucket, toss just the water to the fifth tribe  member. They will race up the ladder, put the water in the final bucket on  the fire tower. Once you fill that fire tower bucket with water, it will  lower, the flame will rise, lighting a fuse, igniting the tower. The first  tribe to ignite the tower wins reward. Want to know what you're playing  for?  <br/>ALL: Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Day 19, taste buds still working, but it's been a  while.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: So we thought we might have a little  dessert.  <br/>Oh! Oh, my God.  <br/>Probst: So we have some ice cold milk.  <br/>Oh.  <br/>And?  <br/>Jeff... Chris.  <br/>Chris' milk. ( Julie laughs )  <br/>Probst: You're a milk lover?  <br/>I'm a milk lover.  <br/>Probst: What goes with milk?  <br/>Cookies.  <br/>Cookies.  <br/>Probst: Chocolate chip cookies. ( cheering )  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>All the chocolate chips and milk we can eat.  <br/>Probst: But it is day 19. I feel like I ought to go see if  there's something else to complete this dessert.  <br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>What else you got?  <br/>Oh, God, it's big.  <br/>Probst: For one tribe, with the milk and the cookies,  comes this. ( cheering ) ( laughter )  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Probst: Worth playing for?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Absolutely.  <br/>Probst: Figure out your strategy, wait for my go. For ice  cold milk, cookies and one of the biggest chocolate cakes I've ever seen,  survivors ready.  <br/>Whoo!  <br/>Probst: Go.  <br/>Go, Sarge.  <br/>Go, Eliza!  <br/>Probst: Eliza and Sarge in the water. Here comes the first  tosses.  <br/>You guys, you guys.  <br/>Nice and easy.  <br/>Nice.  <br/>Probst: Yasur loses almost everything on their first  toss.  <br/>Nothing.  <br/>Probst: Scout really taking her time. ( indistinct chatter  ) And it doesn't help. Rory with only drops.  <br/>Go, go, go.  <br/>Probst: Good toss by Julie. Chris still waiting for  something to dump.  <br/>Ah.  <br/>Probst: Ami goes high and gives Rory a bath.  <br/>Don't try to stop it on your body, Twila. Don't stop it on  your body.  <br/>Probst: Sarge getting irritated with his troop. Somebody  is going to be running laps for Lopevi. Here comes the critical toss. Chris  gets a little water this time. Oh. ( Jeff laughs )  <br/>Eliza you're doing great.  <br/>Probst: Eliza to Leann who tosses to Scout and goes to Ami  into Rory. Rory catches a lot.  <br/>That's it right there. That's it, boys. There you  go.  <br/>Here you go. Guys, use your shirt. You can wring your  shirt out in it.  <br/>Probst: It's fair game. Everybody's using their clothing  items.  <br/>Let's go, Lopevi.  <br/>Probst: Scout to Ami. And Rory bounces it off his chest,  squeezing his shorts. Every drop counts. ( indistinct chatter )  <br/>There you go. There you go, that's it.  <br/>Probst: Twila to Julie. A lot of water in that bucket.  Chad, nice catch. They've got a full bucket. Chad and Chris getting their act  together.  <br/>That's it.  <br/>Probst: Yasur still looks to have a slight lead. Lopevi  getting closer.  <br/>Good one, dude. That was a good throw.  <br/>Probst: Yasur right behind.  <br/>Come on, you guys. We are close.  <br/>I got to just...  <br/>Probst: Ami and Rory still struggling.  <br/>Good job... Nice...  <br/>Probst: He's emptying his shoe, he's wearing so much  water.  <br/>Use your buff. ( Lea speaking quietly )  <br/>Probst: Twila to Julie. Nice catch. Another nice toss to  Chad, and Chris gets a lot of it.  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: Scout to Ami. They've got a good bucketful. How  much will go in? Not enough. ( cheering ) Lopevi extending their lead. Wow. A  lot of water on that last round for Lopevi.  <br/>We're moving. We are moving. Come on.  <br/>Probst: That bucket's starting to move for Lopevi. Yasur  better pick it up.  <br/>Go, Sarge.  <br/>Go, go, go.  <br/>Probst: Lopevi with a great system. Working together  well.  <br/>Come on...  <br/>Come on. ( indistinct chatter )  <br/>CHAD: Ready.  <br/>Probst: Chad and Chris. It's working. Rory and Chris both  heading back up. Both have water.  <br/>Yeah, Chris, way to climb.  <br/>Probst: First one to light the tower wins reward. Lopevi  is moving. That may be enough.  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: And it is. Lopevi wins reward. ( cheering ) Yasur,  good effort. You've been on a winning streak. It ends today. Head back to  camp. Lopevi, you are back.  <br/>We are back.  <br/>Probst: Your reward is waiting for you right here. Your  responsibility to get it back to camp.  <br/>How heavy is it? I hope it's very heavy.  <br/>Hey, the whole cake is there.  <br/>There's so much left.  <br/>All I know right now is I don't want to... see no  chocolate cake. Just the thought of it makes me sick to my stomach right now.  I wish yesterday's challenge never even happened because I guess my body just  wasn't ready for some sugar. It made me feel so awful.  <br/>After all that chocolate yesterday, I thought I'd my fill  a little bit, but no way. Last night, we just kicked butt.  <br/>I knew when she started talking like that, I thought,  "Oh, thanks, Scout." Scout made a few comments last night at the  game, she just kept on and on about me and I'm going "Scout, shut  up," you know, because I need these guys to believe that I'm wholeheartedly  on their side and here she is going on about how she missed me and how she  said a prayer for me and she was so glad to see me and yadda, yadda, yadda.  And hell, yeah, them guys'd be stupid if they didn't read something into that  last night.  <br/>I don't think we've got much to worry about. Julie's  security is right here. She proved that in Tribal Council.  <br/>And with Twila, she's too stubborn to go with those  women.  <br/>She's not going.  <br/>Nah. This morning, I had a conversation with Chris about  this sort of, you know, unity in our pact, and we decided to go one step  further.  <br/>Do you want to do the one I want or do you have something  with Sarge already?  <br/>Sarge has never said "let's go to the end  together."  <br/>Sarge would be a hell of a choice to take to the final two  because he would win.  <br/>I'm going to be honest with you, I think both of you got a  leg up on me. Dude, I didn't mean to say that.  <br/>No, I...  <br/>Totally, dude.  <br/>Listen, no. There's so many puns, dude. There's a  million.  <br/>God, I didn't just say that. I'm pretty much covering all  my bases. Covering all my bases means I'll be good any way it goes. And the  final two.  <br/>All right, man.  <br/>Hey. I threw my hand out. It's just me reassuring my  position in the game because basically I have the same agreement with Sarge,  and I've pretty much made the same agreement with Julie. So, okay, let's say  we merge, do you want to stick together and watch out for each other or not?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I mean, if you're not comfortable doing it... If you don't  trust me, all you've got to do is tell me. I understand that.  <br/>No.  <br/>Maybe I'm going places I shouldn't be going, but if we  merge, Julie could go, Sarge could go, Chad could go. I'm always going to  have two others I can rely on to watch my back.  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. All right. Shall we get to the  challenge? Take back immunity. What happened to the immunity idol?  <br/>They broke its neck.  <br/>I went to stick it in the ground and he snapped.  <br/>Probst: So the immunity idol is broken, which is just as  well, because we don't need it anymore.  <br/>Uh-oh.  <br/>Probst: Drop your buffs. Buffs, drop 'em.  <br/>God.  <br/>Probst: Take 'em off. Drop them at your feet. You're now  one tribe.  <br/>Whoo!  <br/>Hi, Sarge.  <br/>Probst: All right, guys, one big decision to make right  now. Which beach are you going to live on?  <br/>The guys, they've got an excellent place. The beach is a  lot closer and it's better and there's a big fire up on the hill.  <br/>Let's go to the guys.  <br/>Let's go to the guys.  <br/>Probst: Lopevi is the beach?  <br/>Lopevi.  <br/>Probst: So all of Yasur's personal items, all your reward  items, everything you have will be waiting for you at Lopevi's beach.  <br/>How exciting.  <br/>Probst: When you guys get back to camp, you'll figure out  a tribe name and paint up a tribe flag.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Probst: Okay, shall we get to today's challenge?  <br/>ALL: Yes.  <br/>Probst: This is what you covet now, individual immunity  from here on out. Here's the challenge. It is a water race. You'll start on  the beach, swim out to a water tower, climb up the ladder, walk over a  balance beam, grab a flag, jump off and swim back to shore and put it in the  flag holder. The first two tribe members to get all three flags back in their  flag holder move on to the final round. Because there are ten of you we will  run two heats, five each, two people from the first heat, two people from the  second heat will move into the final. One person will win immunity. The other  nine, vulnerable at the next Tribal Council. Clear?  <br/>Clear.  <br/>Probst: All right. We'll draw numbers to figure out your  position. Let's go. Here we go. The first heat is Julie, Eliza, Leann, Chris  and Sarge. The first two to finish move on to the final round. Survivors  ready. Go! Sarge first to the ladder. Chris right behind, then Leann, Eliza  and Julie. Sarge is in the water, Eliza in the water. Chris in the water.  Julie and Leann bringing up the rear. Sarge back with one. Eliza right  behind. Chris right behind. Julie and Leann struggling. Sarge back on the  beam. He's got his second flag. Eliza, she has her second flag. Chris making  up some time. Leann wearing down. Sarge back with two flags, going for his  third. Chris catching on Eliza and passing her. Julie back with her second.  Sarge first in the water with his third and final flag. Remember, first two  to finish make it to the final round. Going to be between Eliza and Chris for  the third flag. Sarge moving on to the final round. Eliza has taken Chris  over again. She's in the lead. It's going to be a race for second place  between Eliza and Chris. Who will get back first?  <br/>Kick, it Chris, kick it.  <br/>Probst: Sarge and Eliza moving on to the final  round.  <br/>Good job, guys.  <br/>Probst: Okay. The second heat of five. Rory, Chad, Twila,  Scout and Ami. First two to finish move on to the final. Survivors ready. Go!  Rory first to the tower. Ami heading up the tower. Twila and Chad right  behind. Rory first up, Ami right behind. Twila still in it. Rory first one  back with his first flag. Ami right behind. Chad right behind.  <br/>Hustle, Chad.  <br/>Probst: Twila bringing up the rear and Scout giving a  great effort. Rory has a big lead. Chad hanging on. He's not fallen off yet.  Fighting to stay in this. Scout back with one. Rory with his second flag. Ami  with her second flag. Can Chad make up enough time? Rory and Ami, both  winded. Looking to get into that last round. Rory and Ami are neck and neck.  Rory wants to win this thing. Rory, Ami, moving on to the final round. All  right, here we go. Final round. Rory, Sarge, Ami, Eliza. First person back  with all three flags wins immunity. Survivors ready. Go! Sarge out to a fast  lead. Ami trying to stay close. Eliza right behind. Sarge up the ladder. Rory  up the ladder. Sarge has his first flag. Rory in the water. Ami places her  jump. Eliza in the water. Rory's going to have to hustle if he wants a shot  at immunity. Sarge back with one. Anything could happen. Rory back with one.  Ami back with one. Eliza back with one.  <br/>Come on, Sarge!  <br/>Probst: Sarge has his second flag, Rory right behind. Keep  moving, Rory. Let's go, Ami. Sarge wants that immunity. He's back with his  second flag. Everybody worn out. Running this back-to-back, taking its toll.  Ami pushing.  <br/>Come on, Ami! You got one more!  <br/>Probst: Sarge in the water with his third flag. Rory and  Ami falling behind. Eliza out of it. Sarge wins first individual  immunity.  <br/>Good job, Sarge.  <br/>You did a good job.  <br/>You animal.  <br/>Probst: Sarge, come on up here. See if this will fit over  that big noggin. Congratulations. Safe at the next vote. Everybody else on  this new tribe vulnerable. You'll head back to the former Lopevi beach,  figure out a new tribe name and figure out who is going home at the next  Tribal Council. Good effort. Head on back. ( whooping )  <br/>Lopevi and Yasur were merged today. We picked the Lopevi  camp, kind of mutually, and for the first time since day one I'm putting the  game behind me, and I'm going to just have some fun with these people that  I've never met. ( talking and laughing )  <br/>I am thrilled. I just missed Twila deep down in places I  can't talk about. It's just a happy moment, you know. Coming together,  reunions are always a happy moment.  <br/>Oh, my God! ( talking excitedly ) Food!  <br/>We come back to Lopevi beach, and there was a big  celebration feast waiting for us. ( talking excitedly ) We had cheese and crackers  and dried fruit, and they had a bunch of leftover chocolate cake.  <br/>Oh, my gosh.  <br/>Wine.  <br/>That's awesome.  <br/>I want a nut.  <br/>Salute.  <br/>Yeah, salute. ( whooping, laughing )  <br/>This place is off the chain right now. We got wine in the  outrigger here. We've got two tribes come together and I mean, everybody is  just so happy. It's a festival right now, and I'm enjoying it. Yeah!  <br/>Look at Sarge.  <br/>There's coffee.  <br/>Sarge, you're going to take off like a rocket.  <br/>I will really enjoy the coffee, believe me.  <br/>I am just so completely ecstatic to be back among men. I  mean, I never thought I would make it out of Yasur.  <br/>It was different when y'all left. Real different when y'all  left.  <br/>Man, I'm so tired of having female conversation. Ami  is...  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Chad is a total blast to be around. It's great listening  to him. We've had a good time.  <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, man. We've only been together, like, ten  minutes and right off the bat, Rory let me know that Bubba got caught by Ami  trying to throw a signal back to us, and he got crushed like a doggone  bug.  <br/>You know, you just got to talk to Chad, I guess, and...  and see what's up.  <br/>I want some coffee.  <br/>Twila, you got a cup right here for yourself.  <br/>Oh, thank you.  <br/>Yeah, I'm going to the water hole.  <br/>Sarge, we're out of water.  <br/>I'm fine, man.  <br/>I'm cool.  <br/>We'll just chill here with the rest of the wine. (  chuckling )  <br/>* And it won't be long till I, till I get on back home.  *  <br/>Nice.  <br/>As soon as we got over there, they were like, "Rory  you're gone next." Ami told us that.  <br/>She just straight out?  <br/>Straight off the bat.  <br/>Oh, my...  <br/>"We have an all women's union, and you guys are  getting voted out."  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>I get my water back there. Some people get it up  here.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>We knew Ami was all on the female kick. We knew it.  <br/>Ami is the top dog over there, and Ami has had me  squirming.  <br/>She's calling the shots?  <br/>Completely.  <br/>How condescending?  <br/>Oh, it's completely condescending.  <br/>Sarge! Where's Sarge at? He done left, didn't he?  <br/>We're talking about us being Lopevi five, right? Our  five-- we are family here. We are so solid. I'm like, if there's any  fragmentation whatsoever over there, maybe we could bring the minority over  to our side and pick off the majority.  <br/>The minority is me.  <br/>Okay. That's all I need to know.  <br/>I ain't gonna lie to you, Rory. I said you weren't a team  player, so, I mean, we had our disagreements, and-and they're behind us, you  know.  <br/>That's water under the bridge.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>To have both Sarge and Chad say, "Our original  alliance is still running. Are you still in?"-- I'm just the cat who  swallowed the canary right now.  <br/>The guys, they assure me that Julie and Twila are 100%  with them, but I don't have any relationship with Julie and Twila, so really  I'm still not in the best spot, but quite frankly, I'm not worried about that  today, because my fortunes have changed. I'm just so happy right now.  <br/>Oh, that's going to be good.  <br/>This is going to be the best flag ever.  <br/>Wow. The new tribe name is Alinta. It's an Aboriginal word  that means "we are the fire; we are the people of the fire." And  they kind of liked that idea, and took off on it. ( excited murmuring )  <br/>I know you couldn't stand it.  <br/>Well, 'cause I can't stand it on myself. I'm so excited  about this merge. It just couldn't be better. I missed the girls who we'd had  on our original Yasur tribe. Julie especially, 'cause we, like, got really  close in the first 12 days and then, you know, being split apart for the last  nine days, I've missed her a bunch.  <br/>You guys are some painting fools.  <br/>Even though I got this pact going and everybody says don't  worry, I see Julie laying next to Ami, and I get real nervous.  <br/>That looks so cool.  <br/>There is that sense that a male-female fight might happen  at the end. It might be a scrap out on the playground between the males and  the females. And so then anything can happen. ( Lea speaks indistinctly  )  <br/>Well, Sarge, thanks for cooking. That's a nice little  treat for our side of the camp. You look around at the energy in the camp. I  don't know. I just have a sense that the guys are feeling a little... uh,  uneasy.  <br/>'Cause he's stronger, He's stron... he's a lot physically  stronger than Ami.  <br/>Are you sure you have him?  <br/>Yes, I do. The numbers is where it's at, Twila. It's just  math. Rory is trying to get in good with me 'cause he's...  <br/>That's why Rory needs to go tonight. That's why. He needs  to go tonight.  <br/>We're down by the creek and Twila and Julie were bringing  up the point of how strong Rory is at challenges and how he can just sweep  through these immunities.  <br/>You have to get over that whole thing.  <br/>No, not really. ( chuckles ) Not really.)  <br/>It kind of appears to be men versus women. It would make  sense to do that because the women are up in numbers, six to four, and we  could easily vote the men off.  <br/>It's like changing oil in a damn car.  <br/>You're not experienced.  <br/>Ah, well, there's only one way to get experience. I really  wanted to just start voting out the guys one by one and have all women at the  end, because, right now, we're at a very critical point. This is a huge  turning point of the game and the first vote is going to be everything.  <br/>Chad says that you and Julie are interested in voting off  Rory.  <br/>Well, I thought that was the original game plan.  <br/>Let me just tell you this. Rory is guaranteed to give us  numbers. And listen, Twila.  <br/>I know.  <br/>If we vote off Ami, that breaks the rest of the girls--  they're done.  <br/>I just...  <br/>Twila is just insecure. She's scared, and you pretty much  have to strategize for Twila. We're not making the decision. We all are  making...  <br/>I'm just trying to get you all to look at all sides of it.  We can't be playing back and forth.  <br/>Maybe you need to talk to Sarge.  <br/>It's kind of hard with ten people around here to talk to  anybody.  <br/>I know.  <br/>This is so much fun.  <br/>Ami has control of all the women. She gets them in her  aura and pulls them in and then tells them what to do, and they run out like  little chickens, you know, with their head cut off doing what she says, and  she sits back being the innocent little girl that doesn't do anything wrong,  and... and it's dangerous. It's real dangerous. Bottom line is I want her  away from Julie, 'cause Julie is like laying under her arm and being kissed  on the top of the head by her and stuff, and telling how hot she is and, you  know, it's just like what the hell, you know. I just want her...  <br/>Out of here.  <br/>...out of here before she infects Julie, and she turns her  charm on you.  <br/>No.  <br/>And she says come on, Twila, let's go lay down.  <br/>Sarge. ( both laughing ) ( speaking indistinctly )  <br/>No, Twila, lower.  <br/>Each to their own, but no thank you.  <br/>Lower, Twila, there it is. Right now, with Twila and  Julie, I feel confident about the way they talk. They talk with a lot of  faith, a lot of character. She's a little confused on who was going home  tonight and she made me a little uneasy for a second. But, you know, we have  a pact, and we're sticking to the pact.  <br/>All right. That's all I needed to know. We can't be  playing back and forth.  <br/>We're not going to...  <br/>Because I don't like that.  <br/>Okay, okay.  <br/>I just told Chris, I said, you all make the choice. If you  want to vote for Ami, just let me know. Just let me know what you all want to  do, and I'll follow it.  <br/>I feel confident about Twila. I feel confident about Julie  and obviously Rory has come back to Lopevi. We've got the numbers. We'll be  good to go. Picking them girls off one by one is what it's going to be.  <br/>I got bloody knife on this one and a spider on this  one.  <br/>Evil.  <br/>Evil.  <br/>I don't know, like, what's been going on throughout the  day, but I don't think that Twila and Julie ever left the women's alliance.  They had to do what they had to do to survive with all men, but I don't see  Twila ever, ever leaving the women's alliance.  <br/>Stick five tight, and we've got it made.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>We're going to be in trouble tonight.  <br/>We are. What are we going to do?  <br/>Play the game. The guys think we're with them. The girls  automatically think we're with them, so who knows? After tonight, somebody is  going to be pissed, but we've got to do what we've got to do. I feel bad  because I care about every one of them, but I'm beating them to the punch.  I'm cutting their throat before they cut mine.  <br/>Probst: Welcome. First things first. I got to know what  the new tribe name is. Ami?  <br/>Alinta.  <br/>Probst: Alinta. Sarge, how'd you come up with that?  <br/>The name came from Scout, who knew the word for  fire-maker, so we figured it's appropriate, Islands of Fire,  fire-maker.  <br/>Probst: Julie, what happened in terms of workload and  leadership and all that?  <br/>Well, gosh, half the tribe worked on the flag and a lot of  people went for wood, and oh, yeah, a lot of the day was spent on body  paint.  <br/>Probst: Who does the best work?  <br/>Oh, this one right here. That one's by far is the  best.  <br/>Yes. ( all laughing )  <br/>Probst: Well, don't waste your flirting on me. I can't  help you any.  <br/>I know.  <br/>Probst: Leann. Would you have preferred to stay as the  Yasur tribe and let Lopevi stay as the Lopevi tribe?  <br/>No. I mean, I think a merge signifies getting further in  the game. I mean, having us all come together feels like, "God, we  really made it this far," and this is where it should get fun and  interesting and screwy.  <br/>Probst: Rory, you've got to feel like you were just given  a second chance.  <br/>I know for a fact that I've been given a second chance,  because Vegas wouldn't have given me odds on making it out of the Yasur camp,  quite frankly. I struggled and I scratched and I clawed and I prayed and I  hoped that I'd hit a merger for an opportunity for a shot at the second half  of the game, and that's what I've been able to pull through.  <br/>Probst: Ami, did you think you'd make it this far?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Based on what? What skills do you bring to this  game?  <br/>What skills do I bring...? A da... a good attitude. A good  attitude, no matter what. Even when things are getting rough, I usually have  a good attitude. It's gotten me this far in life, so... Play with a smile and  good attitude.  <br/>Probst: Let's talk about tonight's vote. It's always tough  when you get to the merge, because you never know what's going to happen. You  don't know who you can trust and who you can't trust. Twila, do you feel a  little stuck in the middle because you've been on both tribes?  <br/>Most definitely. Oh, most definitely. I feel real stuck in  the middle. I've enjoyed both tribes. I felt more at ease around the guys--  there's no doubt about that. But, you know, you form alliances with one side  and then another side and you're kind of stuck in the middle, but tonight, no  matter which way it goes, it's gonna be tough.  <br/>Probst: Sarge, you have the immunity necklace, if you want  to assign it to somebody else, you can.  <br/>Nope. It's mine tonight.  <br/>Probst: All right. Sarge is the only person you can't vote  for. Everybody else is fair game. With that, it's time to vote. Chris, you're  up.  <br/>You're just the, um, unfortunate victim of the master  plan.  <br/>RORY: Ami, this is the first time that I've made a  completely personal vote. Your treatment of me over the last nine days has  been horrible. I have little or no respect for you, and I really hope that,  like a bad rash, you're finally gone. Thank you.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read,  the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal  Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Ami. Ami. That's  two votes Ami. Ami. Three votes Ami. Ami. That's four votes Ami. Rory. Four  votes Ami, one vote Rory. Two votes Rory, four votes Ami. Rory. That's four  votes Ami, three votes Rory. We're tied. Four votes Rory, four votes Ami.  Rory. That's five votes Rory, four votes Ami. Ninth person voted out of  Survivor: Vanuatu, Rory. Bring me your torch. Rory, the tribe has spoken.  It's time for you to go. Well, you are the final nine. Seven of you will make  up the jury, two will make it to the final Tribal Council. One will win a  million dollars. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night.  <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. Next  time on Survivor:  <br/>Camp sucks, kissing and I want to cuddle with you. I'm  tired of hearing "I love you, you love me."  <br/>I'm pro love, man.  <br/>It makes me sick.  <br/>Probst: And Alinta gets a new pet.  <br/>Help! Come here!  <br/>It's a pig.  <br/>I can taste his fatback cooked up with my cabbage.  <br/>No, no, you can't eat him.  <br/>I think that I am the victim of a gender war right now.  The women, they have got the men bamboozled into thinking that they had an  opportunity. I may not be a million dollars richer, but I will never forget  the Islands of Fire. No one has enjoyed the experience of being on this land  more than I have.
