<br/>It's been my dream since I was nine years old to play this  game and have this experience. This is what dreams are made of. I feel like I’m inside my television right now. This is where the fun begins. And I’m playing for so much more than the title of sole Survivor. Mom, this is for you. I love you so much. My mom told me right before I came out here, you can do anything  that you set your mind to. <br/>Jeff: Adam wins! <br/>I set my mind to one goal,  winning this game. It's a dream come true. [applause]  Jeff: Congratulations to Adam on winning the 33rd season  of "Survivor," huge achieve. Before we get into your story, glen, give us one shot. I want to say thanks to all of you guys. What a season. These are all the people that made one of our best seasons  possible. Really great job. [applause] all right. So, Adam, obviously we talked allotted, there's been a lot of  great game play. You had to make some risky moves and some good maneuvers to get  there, but the foundation of your game is what made it so unique, and it was  your purpose for playing, which was your mom. <br/>My mom and I and my whole family have been huge, huge  "Survivor" fans, and even just to be in this theater right now  would have been a dream come true, let alone to play the game, let alone to  win the game. And, so you know, my mom and I almost got on the "Blood  versus water" season together. So when I got this opportunity to potentially go out and win  this game, there was no doubt in her mind what I should do. And my mom was the healthiest person you could possibly imagine. <br/>Jeff: Here's what I found really interesting about your  connection is that we wanted you on the show, told you, that and then you  found out your mom was sick, and I said, look, this is a big deal, we'll  bring you back next year if you want, just do what you think is right, and  that's when the story really turned when you told your mom that and she said,  you got to go. <br/>My mom lived at 100%. She always was dancing and smiling and laughing and loving, and  when an opportunity to make your dreams come true is in front of you, she  would have never passed it up. And she wanted the same for me. And so I talked to my mom, and I talked to my dad, and I talked  to my brother about it. And I said, if now is not the right time, we can do this later,  and my mom said, you have to go now. And we needed something to look forward to, something to  brighten her spirits. <br/>Jeff: And do you think... Could you feel... Did you feel  like you could connect with you when you were out there even though there's  no communication? <br/>The hardest part about the entire thing is not the food,  it's not the sleep, for me it was being away from my family, and yet there  was this energy that I know that she was sending me from home. I know because of who she was, and I know because she recorded  videos for me while I was away that I could watch. For her to live my experience right along with me, and when I found  those idols and when I won immunity, and especially when my brother came out  there, she was with me. And she's with me tonight. <br/>Jeff: Beautiful. Beautiful. [applause] you know, there's a really interesting moment, and I got  asked about this as much as anything out there, which was when you finally  decided to tell somebody, you tell your adversary in the game, Jay, and I really  want to understand, in fact, we got a tweet that represented a lot of people  that asked that, why did you finally open up? Jay, I want to ask you, why do you think Adam came to you? <br/>Me and him have been fighting forever, you know, but we're  like brothers, and I think he just needed an outlet on the island, and I think  he respected me so much, even though he hated me at the same time. We're messed up. It's the most dysfunctional relationship I've ever been in. So I love him, so I showed him respect, so he came out there  and, yo, dude, I love you, and I got to tell someone this because it's  killing me. <br/>So it made sense to you? <br/>Jeff: I knew he was doing that for his mom, as well, and  his family. <br/>Drew: So Adam, okay, you spend 39 days out there. You don't know what's going on back home. You can't even call when the game is over. You have to get on a plane and fly home. You have your reunion with your mom. Walk us through that. <br/>So I get on the absolute first flight I can from l.A. Back to san francisco because I just need to be home. I can feel her calling me home. And my mom had two days before during final tribal council  probably, my mom was walking around the block and she was thriving still, and  I got home and I was able to tell her, I said, mom, I love you so much, and  she was there with me. She was. And she said, I love you. I said, I love you, I love you. She said, don't stop saying that. My dad and my brother, we were all saying it. And she died an hour after I got home. And I needed her to know, and I don't know if she heard me, but  I... Oh, God, this is... This is crazy because my life, right like, it's such  a beautiful story, like I can get that looking outside of it, this is my  life. And it's real, and I told her I won. <br/>Jeff: So you knew? You had a sense? Do you think she heard you? <br/>I don't know honestly,  but it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. <br/>Her spirit. <br/>It doesn't matter because she knew. That's what moms do. She knew. She absolutely knew. <br/>Jeff: That's awesome. Well, there's another aspect to this story that's very important  to you, and that is that Adam's mom passed from lung cancer, even though she  never smoked, was an exercise enthusiast, ate healthy, so there's clearly  research that needs to be done to understand what's happening, and to honor  his mom, Adam has partnered with stand up to cancer to raise money  specifically to fund research for lung cancer, and very cool, bristol myers  squib company, which is a major supporter of stand up to cancer, has offered  they're matching donations for Adam's efforts to raise money up to a total of  $100,000. So it's an amazing gesture that will hopefully inspire people  tonight to want to give. In fact, we're going to put the web site up now. If you're inspired by this, you can go to the web site and give  now, a really cool tribute. Yes? <br/>I have been asking  people. I started this campaign six months ago asking people to  contribute the lung cancer research. I want to be a part of it myself. I want to donate the $100,000 of my winnings to this cause. <br/>Jeff: Wow. <br/>And I hope other people will be same. <br/>Jeff: So you're kicking it off with $100,000, and we have  matchling sponsor for another $100,000. Adam, honestly, thank you to you and you family for sharing this  journey. I'm sure it touched a lot of families and I’m glad you were part  of it. <br/>And thanks to all of you. Thank you all. <br/>Jeff: And even though this is a somewhat awkward transition  to make, Adam's story really does speak to the biggest theme of this season,  which is powerful personal stories where people like David discovered what  they were capable of. Take a look. <br/>My whole life I've had this fear of death. Whoa. Spiders. But over the years it morphed into a fear of life. And that's why I’m here. He lives a fearless life. I want to walk out as the man my father was. I'm going to work hard to make that happen. <br/>Immunity idol. Good work. <br/>I’m just trying the  tamper down that voice that says I can't. <br/>Jeff: David wins immunity. <br/>Way to go, David. <br/>The penny experience can give me that power. Yes! It's "Survivor." [applause]  Jeff: David, you went from... Most of my friends said, oh,  that guy is first off, and all of my writer friends said, you finally put a  writer on the show and this is the guy you put on? But you transformed into a kingpin. You were a power player. What happened out there? Sum it up in a nutshell the transformation? <br/>I just got out there and  I got into the game, and I just had this vice in my head that was telling me  that no one likes you. They don't like you. And then I’m surrounded by these people and they show me such  love and support, and I realize they really do like me, and the irony is  that's what made me such a big threat. <br/>Jeff: So do you hear from people? Are people on the streets saying, I related to that? <br/>People have reached out with their own issues with anxiety  and they've been cheering me on and being super supportive and relating to  it. If I can make them feel a little less uncomfortable, that's  awesome. <br/>Jeff: I love that. Right behind you Zeke almost an equally powerful story started  out and said, I’m the millennial nerd, I don't fit in. You started making fire and everything happened and you  transformed. Let's take a look at your journey. <br/>I willive in brooklyn. I know how to ride the subway and that's the extent of my  outdoorsy skills. I'm the doughy little gay guy. A lot of people didn't believe I could hack it out here. <br/>Hi. Hi. Good to see you. But against all odds -- fire, fire -- I’m reaching my potential. Tribal was amazing. I feel like I’m my best version of myself out here. Today I am a warrior. <br/>This is my hero. This is the strong person I look up to and I model my behavior  after. [applause]  Jeff: Zeke, what I wondered about with you, whereas with David  I felt him sort of stumbling and struggling to figure out, you seemed to be  realizing, I’m powerful. I can do this. Could you feel that happening? <br/>I think I could. Gosh, I got blindsided immediately and knew I had major work to  do, and rung by rung I pulled myself up from the bottom to the most powerful  position in the game. And after a couple allies deserted to me, I had to convince four  people I previously blind sided to stick their hand in a bag of rocks for me,  for me that's the highlight of my experience, to convince four people I blindsided  to stick their hand in a bag of rocks for me. <br/>Jeff: What was it about "Survivor"? <br/>You're not given many opportunities to test you're. The down side is if you don't test yourself, you never know what  you're capable of. I think I've undervalued myself for most of my life. And "Survivor" allowed me to discover that I’m much  stronger than I ever possibly could imagine. <br/>Jeff: Amen. Nice. All right. We're going to take a quick break. But when we come back, I think it was the moment of the season,  and it was when Bret confided in Zeke. I want to see that moment, and I want the find out why Zeke. We'll be right back. <br/>Jeff: Well, when you do a season like this where you pit  two cultures against each other, what you're hoping for is to be surprised by  that clash of culture in a beautiful way, and we've got it when Bret, the  tough gen x boston cop and Zeke, the self-described millennial nerd, provided  what I think was the moment of the season. <br/>Well, I will tell you you're not the only gay guy out  here. <br/>You? <br/>Shhh. I'm playing a game here. I didn't grow up in a time when it was normal to talk about  being gay. I'm hoping from here on out I can be that way, you know? I'm a different generation. <br/>I never even thought  about that. I owe a lot to Bret's generation. I would not have been able to come out at 15 were it not for the  pioneers that paved the way. I think that really reflects this millennial-gen x divide. Cheers, brother. [applause]  Jeff: Bret, I happen to have a bunch of friends over that  night to the house to watch that night of "Survivor," and, yeah,  that applause, my friends went, oh, my God, that's the most amazing thing  I've ever seen. So the same question I have for Adam and Jay, why did you pick Zeke? <br/>You know, it's funny, seeing Zeke in his favorite shirts,  I said, I’m never going to identify with this guy. I never talked to Zeke until after the merge. Once we merged, we started having small conversations, started  leaving to larger conversations. He's really a fun guy to talk with. We had some great conversations out there. Then we had a couple nice rewards. We had the beers going and we're jumping off floating pizza  places. It was... We just started to form a bond. <br/>Jeff: You felt safe? <br/>I felt safe and I wanted  to solidify the bond and say, I know the struggles you went through, I went  through them too. <br/>Jeff: very cool. It was a great moment, and we had allotted, again, we had so  many people asking the same question, joyce stevens tweeted at me, had you  come out to people before? <br/>Yeah, since my mid-30s I started telling close friends and  family. And I think 35 years old, the rumors were getting out. One of my buddies at work called it the worst-kept secret at the  boston police department. But I started to kind of tell people close to me, just to let  people know. <br/>Jeff: Have you had people come it up to you and say, thank  you because I've been thinking about doing the same thing. <br/>A young kid in his 20s that I was friends with, I knew the  family. He said, hey, I don't know what to do, I’m scared, what's going  on. So it's been great. You know? <br/>Jeff: Changing lives. <br/>Well, listen... [applause] well, there was another great  moment this season, equally compelling, it was on the beach with Hannah and Ken. <br/>I do flirt with Ken, but  you look at Ken and you're like, Ken wouldn't have any sort of crush on me,  because look at him. <br/>Just the first few seconds today, you can look at the sun. <br/>You can, you told me that. <br/>It doesn't hurt your eyes. <br/>But just maybe, yeah, Ken and I, yeah, no, yeah, I could...  I could see that. [applause]  Jeff: If only we had a camera on Hannah while she was  watching that going, this is, oh, my God, so weird. Hannah, that to me, the reason I love that moment is that it  really captured your spirit, which was you have insecurities, you got nervous  just watching a challenge, but you didn't care, you just let it fly, and as a  result, people really related to you. What did you discover about yourself either through the process  or through people coming up saying, I dig you so much? <br/>Yeah, I definitely feel bolder and more self-assured than  the first time I voted or when I started this game. I think that for me it wasn't about conquering my anxiety but  learning to find people I could open up to and to push through and it's weird  washing it back. I was very vulnerable on tv, and I was very scared, but I've had  so many people reaching out and tell me that they too have experienced  anxiety and panic attacks and not only did that make me feel not alone in  this whole thing, but I really feel like if I can help or we can help one  person with anxiety go to the job they want or go on a date with somebody  really handsome, you know, then they should do that. <br/>Jeff: Speaking of which, this is also a theme in the  tweets. Kristin moore says, "Hannah's ability to flirt with a  hottie is every goal I've ever had." you are a flirt. <br/>I mean, look at this  group of people. You had these boys with their shirts off and, I was just... I was  like, I’m going to be weird and flirt with the prettiest face on the island  and just see what happens. [applause]  Jeff: Ken, what is really amazing, just as we were  watching this finale, I was watching it back stage with one of my buddy, we  get to you. Here you are, this guy who can fish, you won four challenge, you  can build a shelter, ridiculously handsome, agreed, and you're playing for  your daughter, and yet you have your own achilles heel, and it's not  dissimilar to most of these people's, social anxiety. Did this experience help you at all? <br/>Absolutely. I spend every week dedicating my time to denver who are  homeless. You look at these people, don't judge a book by its cover. You never know what someone has gone through. People look at me and judge and assume all of these different  things, but they don't know about my speechism pend. , my nervous twitch, what I went through as a kid and the  emotional distress I was under for the first 25 years of my life. I may look one way, but put me in a room of five people or 500  people and I’m the wallflower. This helped me the rise above that. <br/>Jeff: And let's answer the the big question: Yes or no,  single? <br/>Uh...  Jeff: It's complicated? <br/>Very much so. <br/>Jeff: Glen, get a shot of Michaela, she's next. One of the most electric, combustible and absolutely  entertaining women of the season. We'll talk to her after this. <br/>Jeff: Welcome back "Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen x" live reunion show. Michaela, here's my take on you. You were dominating in challenges. You spoke your mild at tribal council, but I don't think you  realized what a good player you were until you revealed your strategy and  then Jay and will took you out. Is that true? Is that when you went, maybe I am a first-round draft pick. <br/>That's 100% true. I didn't realize how big of a detriment that seashell thing was  my game until I saw it on tv. So it never once donned on me that people would say, oh, Michaela  is thinking ahead. Because I was thinking, Michaela is thinking about doing this  with me. <br/>Jeff: You were thinking loyalty? <br/>Yeah, but this isn't a loyal crew. <br/>Jeff: There is somebody who was loyal. Jessica, let's talk about that moment. It doesn't happen very often where we go to rocks and somebody  draws. Did you really have any other move? What were you thinking in that moment? <br/>I had no other options. Basically I made the right choice. I picked the wrong rock. That's what it boils down to. <br/>Jeff: Yeah. <br/>This was a game, thank you, this was a game where loyalty  really mattered so much. And how could I turn my back on this guy right here? I mean, the guy that saved me. <br/>Jeff: Your point is that... What I was telling people was  if you say, all right, I’m not going to draw rock, you've just lost votes. <br/>I was being true to  people who were true to me. On the other side there was no love. So really I’m going to turn my become on those that matter? <br/>Jeff: Is that rock on your mantle? I'm kidding. If I were in the final three, I would have lost the final game. It worked out for Adam. He put his hand in that bag of rocks, too, and he's sitting here  a winner. <br/>Jeff: Good point. You have to take those chances. Will, congratulations. You're first high school kid to play this game. That's awesome. You speak to other young teenagers, young kids that I meet all  the time because now they can aspire and say, I want to be like the guy,  will, but you also speak to parents who had to contemplate, wow, would I let  my kid in high school, cyclone, not eating, playing with adult, big  psychological things happening. Was it an easy sell to your folks? <br/>Not at all, no. I think my dad tried to keep it together more, but I think they  both really struggled with the decision to let me go on this show where I am  doing all these crazy things like surviving cyclones and eating bugs, you  know, it's just all these crazy things. And that was definitely a tough thing to sell. The way I sold it was by telling them I’m probably never going  to get on the show. I'm going to apply. I'm never going to get on. Next thing I know I am on, and, you know...  Jeff: They're committed. <br/>I had to go. <br/>Jeff: Nice work. You held yourself well. You were a great first representative from high school. <br/>Thank you. [applause]  Jeff: Sunday, I want to ask you something that I don't  know if we've ever even talked about. We always have so many mom, you, Jessica, CeCe, Lucy, what is  the message to moms who have so many responsibilities to be a parent, to be a  wife and all these other things but still have some adventure they're  seeking? <br/>That it's never too late to go for your dreams. It's never too late to find out who you really are. You can be so wrapped up in being a mom that that becomes your  complete identity or career, and there's always still some of you left to  fine. Take the step, go for the dream and find yourself again. <br/>Jeff: Nice. I love that. I got to ask. Taylor and Figgy, so in true millennial fashion, I honor the  fact that you guys just embraced it and went for it, didn't care, didn't  think it would matter. Figgy, what's the status? There's a lot of talk out there. What's the status of the relationship? <br/>Yeah, so fig tails is put to rest. It's no more. Ultimately out in the jungle, in the wild, I had someone to  confide in, and it was a beautiful thing out there, someone to take away my  paranoia. Ultimately it was my downfall in the game, and I wish, no  offense, I could have played as the independent strong woman I am today from  it. <br/>Jeff: And no offense, it was your choice. <br/>It was my choice, exactly. Blue eye, Jeff. I'm sorry. <br/>Jeff: And Taylor, I think this is okay for me to say,  right, you are the father of a baby, a new baby. <br/>Yeah, now. Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Congratulations. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: You guys were great. I think... I love the millennials. I was super impressed with the spirit. Chris, we have 30 seconds left. This is a question I want to know from you the lawyer, the  thinker, how much of the time in the game do players spend thinking about  twists that might be out there, like we had the legacy advantage, the reward  skill, things you haven't seen but might come? <br/>I think we spend a lot of  time, Jeff, but I think the word is "Adaptable." you have to adapt  your strategy to these twists. I think what a lot of these great players up here in the front  row did is adapt their game when those twists came. You can't... You think about them all the time. You can't predict all of them. And really the best example of adaptability is when I was  blindsided, Bret lost his true love on the show and he had to adapt very  well. <br/>Jeff: Up next, we're going to tell you what we're doing  next season, and we're going to show you some of the people, familiar faces  returning to play again. Survivor: Reunion will continue  Jeff: Ah, Fiji, the most spectacular place we've ever shot  "Survivor." it looks like that for real. Amazing island, crystal clear water, world class surf, scoob diving,  sunset, sand. We liked Fiji so much, we're going back again. Here's what "Survivor" is doing next year. Well, you just made one of the biggest moves in the history of  this game. "Survivor" is the most mentally challenging,  fuzzically demanding -- all right, we're going to have an evacuation -- and  strategically complex adventure game on television. <br/>I’m just playing out  numbers in my head. You probably see me going like this quite a bit. <br/>Jeff: The players have evolved the game by pushing the  boundaries with risky, game-changing moves. <br/>If you were to give up immunity, then I would believe you. <br/>I want to give individual  immunity to natalie. <br/>Sorry. <br/>Jeff: Innovative methods for gathering information. <br/>I can hide right in there  and I’m within five feet away sitting in my spy shack. <br/>Jeff: And all in million-dollar moves at tribal council. <br/>This is the other immunity idol I've been hanging on to. I'm giving it to eddie. <br/>The looks on faces. <br/>Jeff: The game play has become so unpredictable that  getting to the end now demands the willingness to risk it all. <br/>Here's the thing...  I’m drawing rocks unless  someone is voting my way. I'm drawing rocks. <br/>Jeff: And reveal. Katie, grab your torch, head over. Next season we are bringing together the most competitive group  of players ever assessmentabled to battle it out on the islands of Fiji. <br/>It's going to take big moves for me to win this game, and  I’m not afraid to do it again. <br/>Jeff: They'll compete for the million dollar prize and the  title of sole Survivor while launching the game into its next evolution. <br/>I’m the queen for a  reason. You don't get my crown just because. <br/>Jeff: Join us this spring for "Survivor: Game  changers." I’m telling you, you did see one of returning players. Michaela will be back next season. And let me introduce you to a few more. Tony, come on out. Tony will be playing. Ty, come on out. Die la, -- kayla, come on down. Sierra. She voted out her mom. Cerie, first woman to get up off the couch is now a veteran. Sandra. The only person to never be voted out, two-time winner. And perennial favorite, ozzie. This is going to be so fun, in fact, glen, show that footage  from earlier. These guys were here earlier today. We set up some challenges outside. They went outside and played. There it is. We had a blast. If you don't have a ticket to the live show, I’m so sorry. We have so much fun here. We're going to have a great time. Season 34, "Survivor: Game changer." we'll be right  back. <br/>Jeff: It's our last look at this area's group. Michelle, there are no grudges. What is that a sign of? <br/>No one here is bitter. We all knew the game we were coming to play. That speaks to the amazing evolution of this game. <br/>Drew: So people aren't bitter anymore. You get voted out, that's the way it goes. I love that. That's the way it should be. It's a great season. If you want to sit up here one day and play "Survivor,"  the first step, go to cbs.Com and let us know who you are. Also, if you want to bid on props from this season, go to Survivorauctions.Com. Proceeds go to stand up to cancer. I will always say it: Thank you for your loyalty. Thank you for staying us with.
