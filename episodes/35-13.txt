<br/>Jeff: Welcome to the finale of "Survivor: Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers." we are live, cbs television city in los angeles. And this is really a "Survivor" fan's fantasy. We haves set up on the lop. We have fans playing against some of our most popular players. Andrea's out there, cochran's out there. It's starting to rain, which is perfect for "Survivor."  you guys, come in. Get in! They're going to miss the show. All right, our first season-- think about this-- aired in the  summer of 2000, 17 years ago. And many of you have been watching with us from the start. You've never missed a season. You've never midst an episode, and now, a lot of you are  watching with your kids, which is awesome, because "Survivor" can  play on so many levels. On one hand, you have this fantastic social, political game of  human chess with strategy and deceit. But it can also inspire this: A sense of adventure, where kids  that are watching imagine themselves in the jungle making fire, catching  fish. And as you've seen over the last few years, it happens-- those  kids, watching now-- yes, I’m talking to you. You grow up, and you end up on the show. It can happen. All right, let's get to this season and our live studio  audience. [ cheers and applause ] hottest ticket in town. All right! So this season-- have a seat, guys. Have a seat! This season, we started with three tribes. And by Design, the idea was let's put a lot of secrets in the  game. That's what our big creative idea was. Let's have secrets. They'll be everywhere. They'll blindside each other with secrets and then nobody in  this game could keep a single secret pup never know what they're going to do. We lost some favorites early. Katrina, Simone, allen, Jessica, Patrick, Ali, and even Roark,  went home early. You don't come out here and give up everything to leave early  but that's the way the game goes. And we have our jury. Movie our jury. We have a couple of spots left. Once you get to the jury phase, it gets complicated. Because even though they're out of the game, they ultimately  have the final say in who wins because it's their votes and they're going to  be choosing between three of our final five. Devon, man, looking studley. Look at that. Dr. Mike, we've got ben. Ryan. And the only woman left in the game, Chrissy. [ cheers and applause ] all right, so let's set it up. At this point now there are 35 days in, they're running on  fumes. But everybody's still in it, because each of the five could make  a case right now about why they deserve to win this game. Seats really going to come down to who they're sitting next to,  which is why every decision you make on "Survivor" matters. We are are really excited to share tonight with you. It's an epic final episode, one of the best ever. And you are going to see a battle to the very end. Let's get to it. The finale, "Survivor: Heroes vs. Healers vs. Hustlers." âª âª  Jeff: 35 days ago, in the islands of fiji, six Heroes, six  Healers, and six Hustlers. <br/>It begins now. "Survivor's" on. Let's go! Began a season of "Survivor" that would be fueled by  secrets. <br/>I see something labeled  "Secret advantage." I was like woo-hoo! <br/>Jeff: An early secret was shared. <br/>Oh, my gosh. "Someone has secretly chosen you to receive a super  idol."  Jeff: Is and forged a lasting relationship. <br/>So you and I are going to have to be friend. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: But sharing secrets is tricky. Confide in the wrong people... And they'll use it against you. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, new advantages--  "This is being used against to you block your  vote."  Jeff: ...Required bigger risks. <br/>I hope using this works. <br/>Jeff: ...Resulting in surprising moves. <br/>Well, this is the real idol. And it will never be played. <br/>Jeff: And a series of devastating blindsides. The tribe has spoken. And sometimes, the best-laid plans fell to the best help kept  secrets. <br/>I’m going to play this  for myself. <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. At the last tribal council, a "Survivor" first--  I’m in the final five, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. He's playing it early as a sign of power. ...Sent a clear signal...  I just turned the five  against themselves. <br/>Jeff: This season will be a battle to the end. Now, only five remain. Ben, this american Hero is a strategic powerhouse, but his bold  and aggressive game play has turned him into public enemy number one. With now allies left in the game, can he find a way to keep his  torch lit? <br/>I’m not going to give up. I'm going to keep trying. And I’m going to go look around this island for another idol,  and if I can't find it, I’m going to do my best to win immunity. <br/>Jeff: Mike. He's the only Healer left in the game, and despite being  excluded from nearly every vote, this doctor has found a way to stay Alive. With the end in sight, can Mike rise to the occasion? <br/>I’m running on fumes. But I’m ecstatic. I'm on day 37 of "Survivor," and it's like nobody  realizes that I’m gonna win. <br/>Jeff: Devon, true to his nature, he has hustled his way  through the game, controlling votes and orchestrating blindsides. But with only five players left, will that grit be enough to get  him to the end? <br/>I’m sort of seeing my  destiny unfold. This whole game, I've been in a power seat. I've been making decisions. I've manipulated people, but I ain't backing down. I'm going for the million. <br/>Jeff: Ryan. This super fan's knowledge of the game helped him find  advantages and idols. But it's his strong social abilities and his alliance with Chrissy  that have kept him in the game. Will that loyalty pay off? <br/>As a super fan, final five is not good enough. Second place isn't good enough. I need to win this game. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, a rough start nearly sent her home, but she  recovered and seized early control of the game. When the tides turned again, she had to win immunity to stay Alive. Chrissy pulls it out! Chrissy wins individual immunity! Now this resilient mom is the only woman left in the game. Will her roller coaster journey end on a high? <br/>The finish is going to be absolutely incredible. We have so close. There are so many combinations that could happen. I hope we can pull it off in a joyful manner. Of course, it's "Survivor," so that will never happen. <br/>Jeff: Who will have what it takes to outwit, outplay, and  outlast all the rest to win the million-dollar prize and the title of  "Sole Survivor?" âª âª  Thank you. <br/>Did Ben just take off? <br/>Is he looking for the next idol? <br/>There can't be another one. <br/>I don't think there is  another one. <br/>The fact that Ben played his idol, means he now has no  idol, which is lovely. And, frankly, I’m happy that Ashley is gone. So it worked out just fine for me. And now I am in a group of five where four people have the exact  same target-- ben. I can't believe he found another idol. I mean, that really is skill. <br/>Ben is like the bad guy in any horror movie-- I just keep  trying to kill him, and he keeps coming back to life. <br/>Not even entertain hearing him out. That's what I would recommend. <br/>Yeah. <br/>One of us must win tomorrow. <br/>I know. <br/>Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. <br/>Ben needs to leave this game. He's very dangerous. You know, I don't mean the $1 million. I'm playing to win "Survivor" because I am going to be  the ultimate "Survivor." ben's playing because he feels this need  to win this money for his family, which makes him ferocious. <br/>Hopefully he doesn't find that idol. <br/>It was a long tribal, and now we get to sleep. <br/>I agree. <br/>Bring it in. <br/>Let's finish it. <br/>I wonder where he is. <br/>I’m vulnerable, you know. I have no protection now. I have no alliance. And I know they're gunning for me. The only thing that could blow up their game is if I find  another idol. It is absolutely crazy. Nobody followed me. They're feeling too comfortable. I don't know why because an idol can be played until five, so as  long as my heart is beating, I’m looking for an idol. Everybody's sleeping. Everybody's zonked out, cozy with their blankets and pillows,  and I’m out here for my family. So there ain't no time for sleeping or rest. This is more than a game to me, you know. This is a mission. This is a job. <br/>I’m so exhausted. I'm trying to hold my eyes open, and I just can't. I looked everywhere. And I can't find this thing. You know, I feel like I’m letting my wife down. But I know she'll be proud of me for how hard I tried. I'm not just going to roll over and die. But my back supagainst the wall. Oh, my gosh! No way! No way! No way! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? I was about to get some sleep, and literally, right there behind  me, is the ding mark on the gosh darn raft that I've been looking for,  forever. No way! Are you kidding me? I can't believe this. I cannot believe this. Oh, my God! Number three, baby. This idol guarantees me a spot in the final four and, you know, Ryan,  Devon, Chrissy and Mike think they have control of the game, but I'll be  dropping a big old Ben bomb at the end of tribal. You think I’m going home? Watch this. Âª âª  All right. <br/>Nice job, Devon. <br/>Sleep all right last night? <br/>I slept all right. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>My relationship with Ben is so incredibly complex. We were friends to the end, and now we can't stand each other. So I decide that I’m going to approach Ben and simply make up  with him. Can we be friends again? <br/>Totally. Yeah. Come here, honey. <br/>We hugged it out and, you know, now I suppose we're  friends. But, honestly, it is only for game play at this point. I really did miss you. <br/>I missed you, too. I missed talking with you. I missed sleeping next to you. <br/>Now we sleep next to each other but with eight feet  between us. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Truthfully, I still don't trust Ben at all, but for game  play, I needed to have him think that we were working our way towards a  better relationship. Because in the event he wins immunity, I just need to make sure  I get to the final four. If you win today, would you ever consider this: Would you rather  give the final three to the final three best players in the game? <br/>Well, that's the-- like--  You know what I’m saying? <br/>Well, I don't know. I don't know. I'm not stupid. Chrissy's trying to finagle her way in, if I win individual  immunity. And it ain't going to work at all. If you win, immunity today, are you going to take me? I don't think so. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You know what I mean? <br/>Okay, so just in the idea anyway that if you end  up--  Yeah. I'll give it to the lady, props to her. At least she's trying. But you're barking up the wrong tree there, sister. Chrissy is my biggest competitor. She's building a resume at this point. She could win the million dollars. <br/>It's just something to think about. <br/>I don't want her in the  game any long longer. I'm going to play my idol and she's gone. I'm going to play my idol and she's gone. <br/>Jeff: All right, shall we get to today's immunity dismj. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy for the second time, I have to take it back. <br/>Hope to see you soon. <br/>Jeff: All right. Raonce again, immunity is back u for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to swim out to a platform,  climb up a stack of crates, leap off, and retrieve a set of keys. You'll then cross a bAlance beam and retrieve a second set of  keys. You'llize thoyou'll use those ke your puzzle. Finally, you'll maneuver balls to match the corresponding color. First person to line their balls up with the colors on the  wheel, wins immunity, guaranteed a spot in the final four. Losers, tribal council, where somebody will become the seventh  member of our jury. In addition, you're playing for reward. <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: You want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: The winner will enjoy back at camp good old comfort  food. Chicken, mashed potatoes. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: Gravy, veggies. <br/>Oh, my! <br/>Jeff: Wine, and cheesecake for dessert. <br/>Cheesecake! That's my favorite! <br/>Jeff: Big boost going into these last few days, huge  stakes. I know it's worth playing for. We'll draw for sports. We'll get started. All right, here we go. For immunity, a guaranteed spot in the final four, and reward. Survivors ready? Go! Your first step is to retrieve those first set of keys. Devon flying through it, takes his leap, he's got it. Ryan has his! Mike has his! Ben's got his! Chrissy last to get there. Chrissy has hers. Everybody now has their first set. Devon now on to the beam. Ryan crawling out. Ryan drops. He's got to go back. Mike is going to crawl across that beam. Here comes Chrissy, dead last. Ben now on the beam. It is Devon working on those knots. Mike working on the knots. Devon trying to hang in there, he can't. Devon's got to go back. And it's going to go Mike first across with his second set of  keys. Who would have guessed that! Devon's across. You're good! Ryan drops again. He's got to go back. Devon and Mike reach the final stage. Unlock your puzzle! Here comes Chrissy. She is quickly trying to make up ground. Ben is across now. He's good. It is now Ryan left alone trying to get across that beam with  his second set of keys. Now you've got to find which key openopens that puzzle and start  solving it. Ryan's across. He's good! Chrissy has her puzzle unlocked. She is quickly back in this. You've got to maneuver the balls through the middle and match it  with the corresponding color. Ryan last to get here. Now he's got to get his puzzle unlocked. Ben has his puzzle unlocked. Mike was first to get across, but has lost a lot of time trying  to find the key to open his puzzle. Now Mike's in it. Another complicated and brand-new "Survivor" puzzle. You're going to spin that wheel and move the balls around until  all of the balls line up with all of the matching colors. Once you start figuring out how this works, you can start moving  fast. But the key to this challenge is you have to be able to look  several moves ahead and figure out where these balls need to get to and how  to get them there. Mike moving nicely now. He's got something going. Chrissy has been moving fast from the beginning, like she knows  this puzzle. Ben now moving nicely. Ben is making progress. It is ben, Chrissy, and Mike right now, with Ryan and Devon  getting lost. The only person left in the game that has won an immunity is Chrissy. She's won two. Immunity at tribal is the single greatest feeling you can have  at tribal. The only way to make sure you live to see day 38 is right here. This could come down to a few moves, and who will get there  first. <br/>Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy thinks she has it. Chrissy has it! Chrissy wins individual immunity, guaranteed a spot in the final  four and a nice reward back at camp! <br/>Nice job, Chrissy. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, come on over. Third individual immunity win puts you within one of the record  on "Survivor" by women in this game at four. More importantly, guarantees you a spot in the final four, one  step closer to the end. And you have reward back at camp. Comfort food for one would be nice with two. Bring one person to join you. <br/>I would like to bring  doctor Mike. <br/>Jeff: Doctor Mike come on over. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I went with him on the  last one. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: All right, Chrissy, there is enough food for one  more. <br/>I think I'd like to bring  Devon. <br/>Jeff: Devon, come on over. Join us. <br/>Thank you. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>Jeff: All right, so back at camp, you guys will enjoy the  food. Ryan and ben, you'll enjoy--  Nothing. <br/>Jeff: You're right, I got nothing for you. Somebody going home tonight will become the seventh member of  our jury. It will not be you. Congrats. Grab your stf, head back to camp, see you tonight at tribal. <br/>Chrissy is unbeatable. I'm bummed she won because I was gunning for her. I just have to figure out the best way to use this idol and make  a decision on who is going âª âª  Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, we each have our own chicken! <br/>Are you serious? <br/>Guys, do you think--  We each have our own chicken. <br/>Do you think there's a clue here to the idol. I think there might be a clue here so can we just look for two  seconds. <br/>There might be. <br/>Look under all the chickens. <br/>No chickens, no napkins. <br/>We're good. <br/>Let's eat. <br/>If Ben somehow can find another idol, then this game could  blow up yet again. So the first thing we did at the reward was went through every  scrap of everything looking for a clue, and there was nothing. <br/>With kwe please cheers to us three and Ryan being final  four. <br/>Yes! Oh, yes! <br/>Okay. <br/>Tonight's tribal council is about trimming the fat, and  getting to the final four. My entire game at this point is focused around getting Ben out. <br/>So can we discuss the possibility of Ben playing another  freaking idol tonight? <br/>No way. I'm voting ben. <br/>I’m voting ben. <br/>I’m voting ben. <br/>And if I go because he plays the third idol in a row, then  so be if. <br/>Yeah, but good for us, that Ryan is baby-sitting ben. <br/>So you got baby sitting duties while they're off eating. That's the way they figured, huh? It does kind of suck. <br/>You're telling me. <br/>Yeah. <br/>If we could find the immunity idol, and I'll wear the  immunity necklace, then we'll give someone the dead super immunity necklace. And just be like, "Sorry, dude."  Hold on. You have a necklace associated with your super immunity? <br/>It's dead. It's been-- it only was-- it only was good for a day. <br/>We could plant it. <br/>But we can, one, plant it. Or, two, we can tell Ben we had a clue and found the idol. It would be like, Ben you're done. <br/>Perfect. <br/>I mean, this is the best  plan ever. It's going to make-- it's going to shut him down. He'll just lay in the shelter all day. <br/>How fun would that be? Ben has proven himself to be incredible at finding idols. So the plan is simply to use that dead super immunity idol that Ryan  gave me at the first tribal council, put it together with the instructions  from Ryan's actual idol that was played. And tell Ben that we found the idol so that he'll stop looking  this afternoon. It's so brilliant. <br/>I’m going to go fill my  water. I'm going to start looking. <br/>Don't waste too much energy. <br/>What is that? <br/>Wow! Well done. <br/>No way! For real? You found an idol? <br/>It was more than a reward. <br/>Let me see-- let me see the paper. Oh, wow. That's a fancy one, too. <br/>I’m just telling you, you  might as well not waste your energy. I mean, save your energy. <br/>An idol at a reward, huh? <br/>Nothing like two in one day. [ laughs ] well. <br/>I don't know which one  I'll wear on top, but, clearly, I'll be giving this one away tonight. <br/>To me? <br/>No. <br/>Well, that's a downer. I figured if I didn't win today, I was going home anyway. Well, I’m going to go get some water. <br/>I would say that went  well. [ louvres ] that was so good. <br/>Oh, man, he bought it hook, line, and sinker, and it  really worked to perfection. He was shocked, and that let us all know he does not have a  hidden immunity idol, which is a very good thing. <br/>Are you kidding me? There ain't no way it's a real idol because I got the one in my  boot. Oh, my God. How epic is this? "Well don't waste too much energy." classic, classic. It's a good-looking fake idol, too. Now I don't even have to fake look for idols no more. She just made my job easier. Yeah, two-fer. Got me a two-fer. Nope, no, you didn't. You got a one-fer. I'm one step haefd them through this whole darn game. <br/>Is that the idol? You found it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>These four think they're so smart, but it's like a bunch  of blind mice just running around bumping into stuff. <br/>Oh! <br/>Nobody saw that. <br/>Are you okay? <br/>Oh, yeah, I’m fine. I just fell. <br/>I think they do  underestimate me, you know. And it's hilarious for me. But one of them's still going home. I mean at this point I kind of got my hand on everyone's fate. Tonight, it comes down to who I can beat. And the challenge tomorrow. Ryan is safe because as far as challenges go, that boy ain't  done nothing. <br/>Cool! <br/>So it's between Mike and Devon. <br/>We're set, dude! <br/>So physically, Devon is the strongest competitor. But doc, he's good at challenges and he's good at solving  puzzles. Not fast, but he's good. So this decision is huge. <br/>I know you're bummed. <br/>I’m not bummed. <br/>You're not? <br/>No, dude. I'm going to have a meal tonight. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I would have rather have  liked to make a million dollars but, whatever. It is what it is. <br/>I’m getting a weird  feeling from ben. He's acting like he's givingip in this game. But he wouldn't just give up like that. Ben's a good player. He's dangerous. He may just be acting one way so that we think he hasn't found a  hidden immunity idol. It's terrifying. <br/>Do you know whose name he's writing down? <br/>No. <br/>I’m voting ben. <br/>Yeah, I know, I know. <br/>So you're certain he doesn't have an idol. Because I’m thinking of putting doc's name down tonight just in  case. <br/>Why? <br/>I don't know. <br/>I mean, I followed him  all day. <br/>Yeah, but it couldn't hurt, right? <br/>I don't think you should  do that. Just, you know--  Pis him off? <br/>Yeah, you know. <br/>I’m going to see how  tribal goes tonight. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>As long as you're certain-- okay. All right. I want to believe that there's no more idols. I mean, for Ben to find another one would be crazy, but maybe if  I vote Mike, it's kind of provide meeg with a little safety net. The super bowl, Mike will be pissed off at me, and wouldn't take  me in the final three. And, you know, this is our real shot where we actually feel  like, finally, we're getting rid of ben. I just got to pray that Ben doesn't pull off a miracle tonight. [ applause ]  Jeff: So much game play happening. Chrissy's on fire. She's unbeatable. The four are gloating. They think they're sending Ben home. But Ben knows that isn't happening. But the question-- the question is Devon. He suspects something's off. He's considering voting for Mike, but it's risky because if  you're wrong, it can cost you. One bad decision in this game haunt you forever. Stand up, you you guys. Where are you from? <br/>Originally from new york, but we live here in l.A. <br/>Jeff: All right, so what do you do in this case? If you're Devon and you've got a weird sense but you're in an  alliance with four? <br/>Your gut, you have twoog your gut. <br/>I mean, if you're Devon,  you have to ensure you're in this game another day. So if you've got to put Mike's name down, put it down. <br/>Jeff: All right, okay. See, and that's why this game continues to entertain us. It's a strategy, and you can play along at home because you have  to be playing at a high level, and if you're not the one making the move,  somebody else probably is. I total you, it's a battle to the end "Survivor"  finale. We're just getting started! Âª âª  Jeff: We'll now bring in Desi. Cole. JP. Joe. Lauren. And Ashley, voted out at the last tribal council. So I’m dying to know, last tribal council, everything goes  crazy, Ben plays another idol, everybody turns on Ashley. You get back to camp, Ryan, what happens? <br/>So, there's a lot of confusion because, once again, nobody  knew that Ben had the immunity idol prior to tribal council. And it was another "Survivor" first. I don't think anybody has ever played an idol before the votes  have been cast. But, ultimately, we were happy that we all made the final five  because of the confusion that was going on at that tribal. <br/>Jeff: Devon, is it fair to say that the group has made Ben  the common enemy? <br/>Yeah, it's very clear. He's thrown his moves out there, kind of in-your-face moves. He's not one to stay behind the curtains and make secret moves. He's just out here to play. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, at the last tribal, you were surprised that  Ben had an idol. How does that happen when Ben is the common enemy? Why is he left alone to find an idol? <br/>As much as we try to baby sit a person around camp, we  just can't be with them 24 hours a day. I mean, he's getting up in the middle of the night and running  around looking for idols. I mean, we're at day 37, and we're all exhausted and running on  fumes. And we're just hoping somebody else will take that on. <br/>Jeff: Mike, does that feel true to you, that maybe it is a  combination of the four of you thinking in similar ways, and then hoping  somebody else is actually doing the hard work? <br/>I think that I spent my  fair share of time with Ben or watching ben. But at the same time, Ben has been a great buffener this game,  right? Like, every time Ben is still here, there's a common enemy. <br/>Jeff: And, Chrissy, while Mike was talking, you pulled  something out. <br/>So, the immunity challenge was the gift that keeps on  giving. Not only --  I'll say it for you-- not only do you win your third  individual immunity, which puts you within one of the record for a woman in  this game-- four. <br/>Right, thank you. <br/>Jeff: You also win reward. <br/>I win reward. And I took Mike and Devon to a feast back at camp. And while I was there, I found a clue to the idol and went and  dug it up. And I actually did end up sort of doing what Ben did, which was  playing the cards out in the open. So the plan is just by the end of the night, I'll give it to one  of these guys since, obviously, I don't need both. <br/>Jeff: So, ben, how did Chrissy deliver the news to you  about the idol? <br/>I was going to go get  some water and look for an idol, and she said, "Well, don't waste your  energy." and then she pulled it out and showed it to me. And, yeah, it was pretee that was a heartbreaker. <br/>Jeff: And did the vibe at camp change after that? <br/>Yup. These guys are all pretty happy about it. My chances of staying in the game was either to win the immunity  necklace or find the idol. And Chrissy had quite the day today. <br/>Jeff: Devon, how would you describe it in terms of  graceful or gloating? <br/>I don't think Chrissy was  gloating in any way. I think she was being more graceful. <br/>It was 100% gloating, Jeff. She was on cloud nine with her little necklace, and I think you  said, "Oh, it was a great day. It was a two-fereday," or something like that. <br/>I might have said it was  a two-fereday. I'm proud of my day. I had a good day. <br/>Jeff: Ben, what's it feel like to sit where you are right  now and know that the end could be tonight? <br/>It's pretty rough. I came out here to win a million dollars for my wife and my  kids. You know, it sucks. It sucks, flat out, Jeff. To see the dreams get ruin by these four-- and good on them. But it's a hard pill to swallow. <br/>Jeff: Ryan, when you hear Ben say that, it's sort of the  truth for everybody who gets voted out is they, in essence, they are blaming  everybody else for killing their game. And, yet, that's the point of the game. <br/>Ben really completely destroyed the game. I had to completely readjust my game and retool to get to the  point where I am at today. I don't know. I don't like blindsiding or voting anybody out. I love this game, but that is not something I take joy in. But at the end of the day, us four had the numbers, and it just  so happened that he was on the outside of them, and that's-- that's the game. <br/>Jeff: Okay, it is time to vote. Mike, you're up. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  tonight is the last time you can do so. <br/>Does anybody want this? <br/>No. <br/>Okay. [ whistling ] [ explosion ] Ben bomb! La-la-la! While you guys were sleeping, what's that saying, "The  early bird gets the worm?"  Oh, my gosh! <br/>Jeff:  Jeff. <br/>This guy is insane. <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Ben will not count. I'll read the votes. <br/>Since we're pulling fake idols out, I might as well get  mine out, too. <br/>Jeff: First vote, ben. Does not count. <br/>Well played, ben. <br/>Jeff: Ben, does not count. Ben, does not count. Dr. Mike, one vote dr. Mike, one vote left. Devon. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: We have a tie. One vote Mike, one vote Devon. <br/>Did you write down my name? <br/>I did. Sorry, Mike. <br/>Jeff: So here's what's going to happen. We're going to revote. We will only vote for Mike or Devon, and Mike and Devon will not  vote. Ben, you want to come grab the urn? <br/>Now your faith is in those two. <br/>Yeah, it is. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote, Devon. Mike. One vote Mike, one vote Devon, one vote left. 14th person voted out and the seventh member of our jury, Mike. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Good game, guys. <br/>You lived your dream. <br/>Jeff: Mike, the twrieb has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>See you, doc. Love you. <br/>Good luck, everybody! <br/>We love you! <br/>Thanks, Mike. <br/>Jeff: Well, congratulations. You have made it to the final four. Tomorrow, you'll compete in your final immunity challenge. And to give you something to sleep on, there's a twist. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>I thought you were  literally going to give us something to sleep on. <br/>I think they felt like  they needed Devon more than they needed me in order to beat ben. <br/>And get it. If I made it to the final three, I would have won "Survivor."  but I made it 37 days in the greatest game ever invented on the face of this  earth. [ cheers and applause ]  Jeff: He did it! It was a huge move, but that is how you play "Survivor."  Devon had a bad feeling. He listened to his gut, and as a result, Devon's still in, dr. Mike isn't. Dr. Mike, come on out! [ cheers and applause ] wow. Look at the love! How you doing? <br/>I’m good, Jeff. I'm good. <br/>Jeff: That's got to feel pretty good. <br/>It's amazing, guys. It's amazing. Look at this. This is awesome! [ cheers and applause ]  Jeff: All right, so, here's what I want to know. Given how tight you guys were, when you saw that vote, were you  shocked or did it go through your mind that it could happen? <br/>These guys are all great players. And I knew this could happen. But I was hoping it wouldn't. I was, like, holding my cards, one more vote. I almost made it. <br/>Jeff: Did you debate doing the same thing to Devon? <br/>Oh, I was planning to. I told-- I told Ryan I was voting for Devon tonight. And I just --  So that-- okay, that's the difference right there. Devon has-- we always say to people before-- before the game  starts, "Play as though you're playing for the second time,"  because you have to make big moves. Devon made the big move pup didn't. You're here. He's still in. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. Thanks. Should I throw the check in the fire? <br/>Jeff: One other-- one other ye, just from a dream point of  view, you talked about-- your wife even said it-- it's the only selfish thing  you've done in your life. Did it fulfill? Why was this the dream? <br/>I mean, you're as a kid,  you grow up and you want to have a family and you want to have a wife and  kids and I got it, and it's amazing. But at the same time, I want to win "Survivor." I want  to play "Survivor." and it-- [ applause ] I got so close! 37 days! And this was the first vote that I was, like, you know what, I got  to look one more vote ahead, set up my final three so I can win and then  --  Boom! <br/>We got a Ben bomb. <br/>Jeff: Just remember if you're watching, say I'll do it  next time. There is no next time on "Survivor." we're down to  four. There are no more immunity idols, but as you just heard, there  is a twist, and it's a big one. [ applause ] âª âª  Is and then there was four. <br/>We made the final four! Tribal councilful not what I expected at all. Ben shocked everyone, pulled out his third idol in a row. Insane. <br/>You know you're the only person ever to write my name down  in this game. <br/>Welcome to the club, then, welcome to the club of having  your name written down. <br/>Welcome, welcome. <br/>I’m just so stoked to be  here, guys. <br/>Me, too, man, me, too. <br/>If I didn't write down doc's name, I would be out of the  game. I just had this feeling Ben was playing all of us, and I went  with my gut, and doc went home and I didn't. I'm still sitting here Alive. So I potentially did make a million-dollar move right there. <br/>"Survivor" encyclopedia. Has a Survivor ever played three idols in a row successfully? <br/>No, you were the first. You're ruining my game. Vote by vote. I'm so happy for you. [ laughter ] triba Tribal council was amazi but, you know, this is where it  gets tricky. I have no more Ben bombs to drop in on tribal. There ain't no more idols in the game. So the final immunity challenge is by far the biggest moment of  my life, and I have to win it because ain't none of them going to take me to  the end. The only way I’m getting to the end is if I take myself. <br/>Damn you, ben! <br/>I have to win! <br/>I have to win immunity  tomorrow. I have no protection now. I have no alliance. But I do have my wife and my kid. That's what I’m thinking about, and that's my driving force. So it's "Go" time. I'm going to give it everything I got. Y'all, I’m going to go get water. <br/>Go ahead. <br/>Do you want to follow me? <br/>No, good thing we don't have to do that anymore. <br/>I wonder what the twist  is. <br/>The twist is we need to beat Ben tomorrow, I feel like. <br/>The eenl way we have a shot is if we beat him at immunity. <br/>Exactly. <br/>That's pretty much where we're at. <br/>I can't get rid of ben,  and it's driving me absolutely bananas. But the reality is, even though I feel like can beat ben, I don't  want to bring him to the final three. So as long as one of us wins immunity, he will be voted out of  the game. Then again, we don't know what the twist is, right? So the twist could totally foil those plans. I have no idea. I've come to decide that you can't expect anything in "Survivor"  because no matter what you expect, something else is going to happen. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! All right. Final four. Shall we get to your final immunity challenge? First things first, Chrissy, for the third time, I have to take  it back. <br/>I hope to see you again  soon. <br/>Jeff: For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to stack letter blocks on a  very wobbly platform. First person to spell "Heroes, Healers, Hustlers,"  wins immunity and with this necklace, guarantees themselves a spot in that  final tribal council, where you will get a chance to plead your case to the  jury about why you deserve the title of "Sole Survivor" and the  million-dollar prize. Losers, tonight, somebody will become the eighth and final  member of our jury. And as I mentioned, last night at tribal, there is a twist. The winner of today's challenge also receives the final secret  advantage of the game. Stakes don't get any bigger. We'll draw for spots, and we'll get started. All right, here we go. Big stakes. Final immunity challenge. Survivors ready? Go! First it's home blocks can you carry out? Then you have to unlock this structure with your foot, and then  it gets wobbly, and that's where the work starts. You have to bAlance these letters without them dropping. Ryan off to a fast start. Ben now working on two letters. Chrissy has letters quickly. Chrissy drops. She's got to go back. Once you drop, you've got to lock your structure in, pick up  your blocks, and go back and start again. But any blocks that remain are still good. Ryan locking out, locking out is a big part of this challenge. When you lock your structure back in, that is often where you  drop blocks. Ryan now with the early lead. He's going to head back. And Devon drops. That's what I’m talking about. You have to be gentle when you lock this back in. You've got adrenaline pumping through your body, but you've got  to remain calm. This is your final immunity challenge. This is not going to be easy. Ryan now with the early lead. He's got "Heroes" spelled. Devon is starting over. Chrissy still working on "Heroes." Ben now has his  first word spelled. Can he lock in with the touch required that nothing will fall? And he does. Ben now heading back for more letters. We are neck and neck right now with Ryan and ben. Ryan begins working on "Healers," the second word. Devon back on "Heroes." Devon drops again. Chrissy drops. Chrissy struggling for the first time in a long time in a  challenge. Right now it is not looking good. It is now Ben working on his second word. Ben really taking his time, not panicking at all. Ryan's got "Healers" completed now. Ryan is two-thirds of the way there, and starts his way back. Ben right on his tail. Ryan at the critical point. And he drops three. Ryan has to go back. And that opens the door for Ben now! He's now going to try to lock in. It is now Ben in the lead. He has nobody even close to him. Immunity on the line, a line. A guaranteed spot in the final three. This is all all-in move by Ben right now. No secret, Ben has been the target, trying to get him out,  unable to do it. And here we are in the final immunity challenge. Ben just a few letters away from winning his way to the end. Ben places another letter. Ben has four letters left. If he's right, this would secure Ben a spot in the final tribal  council. Ben places his last letter. He's still got to get this locked in and be right. Ben looking for that last touch. To lock in. Ben thinks he has it. <br/>Jeff: No, something is not right! What's wrong? Ben's got to figure out what he did wrong. The door is still open! Devon now picking up the pace! Ryan sees the opportunity. Chrissy not giving up. Now Ben is panicking. Racing to get back out there, and he loses blocks. Ben loses almost everything! Disaster for ben. He's got to head back and redo all the work he just lost. Ryan now with a comfortable lead, and he can now slow down. And Ryan haas lost nearly everything. And Chrissy loses everything. And Devon drops. He's got to go back. Wow! What a turn of events. The door is wyatt open again in this challenge. Ben is back in the lead now. Ben quickly has put "Heroes" back together. He's now going to try to lock in. And Ben once again moves too fast and loses absolutely  everything! The lesson in this challenge is staring you in the face: You  never give up because all it takes is one person to drop one piece, and  you're back in. This is what you want on day 38 in the final immunity challenge  on "Survivor." oarve is still in this! Oarve is still in this! <br/>Jeff: Devon drops again. Ryan drops more. And more. Chrissy working on "Hustlers." Ben closing the gab  right now as he finishes "Healers." he's now trying to lock in  without dropping any blocks. Ben races back, and he's going to grab all the blocks for his  last word once again. Chrissy places another letter in "Hustlers." it's Chrissy  in the lead. Ben right on her tail. All the letters he needs to win this challenge in his arms if he  can finally complete the challenge. Ben places his first, Chrissy places another block. Chrissy is four blocks away from finishing this challenge, but  the block blocks are a long ways Ben has all of his with him. Which strategy will pay off right now? Ben places another letter. Chrissy trying to get out there quickly. She is within one challenge of tying the record for the most  ever for women on "Survivor" with four. Ben places the last letter in "Hustlers." but he has  got to get back to the start with all of the letters in place. And he cannot do it again! Ben cannot believe it. He has once again dropped almost half of his stack, and now Chrissy  is back in the lead. Ben has now got to lock in, race back, and hope for a mistake  from Chrissy right now. Chrissy has one letter left. Chrissy reaches out and places her last block. Ben is not giving up. Chrissy just needs to lock in without dropping anything. And she is guaranteed a spot at the final tribal. Chrissy has it. Chrissy's back. Chrissy wins her fourth individual immunity challenge! Guaranteed a spot in the final three! An absolutely epic final challenge. <br/>Good job, Chrissy. You're amazing. <br/>Well done. <br/>What a challenge. Âª âª  Jeff: Chrissy, come on that's a big smile. <br/>Yup. I thought the first one was good. <br/>Jeff: Fourth one even better? <br/>The fourth one is even better. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, for the fourth time individual immunity is  yours. This necklace guarantees you a spot at the final tribal council. There's one more thing that comes with this win. <br/>I forgot! <br/>Jeff: The last secret in the game. Only you will know it. As for the rest of you, after 38 days, tough "Survivor"  days, Ryan, Devon, ben, somebody will become the eighth and final member of  our jury. <br/>The final immunity challenge was awesome. I am in the final three. And tied the record for a woman for the most individual immunity  wins in a season. And the icing on the cake will be Ben going home. [ cheers and applause ]. <br/>Jeff: That was one of the most dramatic challenges in  "Survivor" history. You had exhaustion, elation, despair, the upside-down  "U." and it was madness here. Roll back some of our audience watching this. It is so fun to be here and listening to these guys with every  oooh, and aaah. The upside down u.N. And Chrissy setting a record. Chrissy is unbeatable right now. Stand up, what is your name? <br/>Maggie. <br/>Jeff: You look like you have to be a Chrissy fan. <br/>Oh, yeah, she is unreal. <br/>Jeff: What do you say when you-- you-- hi, how are you  doing? <br/>I’m doing great. <br/>Jeff: I’m so glad yawr here with your buff on, too. Think about this, applied for 16 years, oldest woman out there,  only woman left, tied the record for women with individual wins. What is Chrissy never giving up on her dream say to you about  your own life? <br/>Man, it just tells me that it's never too late to just  rock it! I mean, that woman! She's amazing! <br/>Jeff: Your mom's rocking it. She's ready to rock it. And I gotta ask-- pop up, qliewrs name? <br/>I’m grant. <br/>Jeff: Because I was watching you. Are you a Ben fan? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: The upside down "U." it's going to haunt  him forever, that "U." Chrissy is in the final three, and the  question is who will join her? There are no more challenges. There are no more idols. But there is one twist left, and Chrissys that. The question is what is it? Find out. [ applause ] âª âª  Good game, you all. <br/>You kept us all on our toes that whole time. How many times did you almost have it? <br/>Three or four. Daggone, man, that one hurt. <br/>Everyone was in the lead at one point. <br/>Yeah  Like there was--  That final immunity challenge was a butt-kicker, man. I was so close so many times. I knew I had to win immunity to stay in this game. And it just hurts that a silly mistake is going to cost my dream  and my family's dream. Good job, misChrissy. <br/>Thank you so much. <br/>A million dollars is at stake today, my kid's college, retirement. I just let it slip away. And that-- that hurt. That hurt. <br/>Crazy. <br/>I do feel for him as a  person. <br/>You can be a millionaire, Chrissy. <br/>First of all, you could be a millionaire, and Devon could  be a millionaire. <br/>True. <br/>Right? <br/>I know one thing, Ben will  not be. <br/>I’m pretty much the only  target on the board at this point. But until Jeff snuffs my torch, there might be options. Is there any way that I could stay in this game and go to the  end with you? <br/>Um--  I'd love to sit next to you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And I respect if you don't want to sit next to me. <br/>Okay, so this is, actually, how I will respond to you. And that is by saying I will go into tribal tonight and hear you  out. And you have my word on that. Ben approached me to see if I would consider taking him to the  final three. Now, I didn't want to say absolutely not, because I didn't want  to shut him out. So I told ben, ", you know, what, I’m willing to think  about it." but there's no way that's happening. Ben needs to go. All right, you. But before I can think much further about, that I need to get  away privately to read my secret advantage. Okay, secret advantage. "Congratulations. You are in the final three. You have also won an advantage in the form of information. This is the last and perhaps biggest secret of the game, and you  are the only one who knows. Tonight, you are in charge and will cast the only vote. You will choose one person-to-to sit--" uuuh! "You will choose one person to sit next to you at the final  tribal council forcing the two remaining players to around their way to the  end by battling it out in a fire-making challenge. The winner secures the final seat. The loser becomes the eighth member of the jury. Jury." this is a huge twist in the game, and it means the door  is open for Ben to potentially come to the final three. Not good. But right now, I have the power because I am the only one who  knows about the fire-making challenge. So my decision is simply based on who can beat ben. I've got Ryan and I've got Devon. Ryan probably never made a fire in his life. So the only way to send Ben home is to have him make fire  against Devon. Now, I need to tell Devon so that he has time to practice. Like, whatever he needs to do to get ready for this challenge, I  want Devon to do. "And you'll choose the person to sit next to you."  wow. <br/>If I pick you to sit next to me, then Ryan has to make  fire with ben. If I pick Ryan, you will need to make fire. <br/>So it's up to me. It was shocking to me. I didn't expect this twist. Immediately, I know she's showing me this because she thinks I’m  the only one who can beat ben. I'm excited, man. I'm pumped. It's going to give me that exact umph at the end of my game to  show the jury they deserve the million dollars, that I’m one who took down  ben. <br/>I don't want Ben to know  he has a chance. This is your day. <br/>Okay, I can do this. <br/>How fun is this twist going to be,o a scale of 1-10, Chrissy? <br/>0. <br/>What is it? <br/>Devon and Ben are going to have a fire-making? <br/>Why? <br/>She brings one person with her. She's bringing you. <br/>Oh, my God, thank you. <br/>The other two must battle it out and make fire. The only way to get Ben out is for Devon to make fire and beat  him. <br/>I couldn't beat him. <br/>I know. <br/>Oh, my gosh! Devon's going to have to make fire against Ben and Chrissy says  that "You're going with me to the final three." I am floored. Who knew that my inability to make fire would save me on day 38. Ineic. <br/>He will be the one person who can finally get him out of  this game. Go get flint right now and practice. <br/>Throughout this game, I have been able to start fire with  flint. I've done it plenty of mornings, but I need to practice. I've done it plenty of mornings, but I need to practice. <br/>So I’m strike the flint, and all of a sudden, it breakses. I'm thinking this probably meant to be. This flint just broke because I’m not supposed to waste my  energy. I need to go into this tribal council calm, cool, and I need to  believe in myself because I doment the million dollars for my life, for my  family's life, for everyone I care about. Tonight could change the rest of my life. It all lies on me. It's crazy. <br/>Ben has no idea that he will be going to a fire-making  challenge tonight. This game's in Devon's hands, and I’m hopeful that he can do it. But I am very nervous. Either one of those guys could win it. So once again, it is going to be a very interesting tribal  tonight, and we will not have answers until the bitter end. [ applause ]  Jeff: A brand-new twist sets up the biggest showdown of  the season, quite possibly a million-dollar fire-making challenge between two  very popular guys, Devon and ben. But Chrissy, so smart, only told her alliance so Ben has no idea  he's going to get another shot. He's got no time to prepare. He thinks it's game over. Which is why we say all the time on the show you never give up. Never give up! Because you never know what is coming around the corner. We are live in los angeles! Âª âª  Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Desi. Cole. JP. Joe. Lauren. Ashley. Dr. Mike voted out at the last tribal council. All right, so let's start with today's immunity challenge. Chrissy, you win your fourth individual immunity, tying the  record for the most individual immunity wins by a woman. Nicely done. So what's the feeling? When you just take in that moment, knowing you have secured  yourself a spot at the final tribal? <br/>For me, the fourth win was incredible knowing I was going  to the final three. And that was a super-hard challenge. So it was just a great feeling all around. <br/>Jeff: Ryan, it was one of the most electric challenges  we've ever had. And you had the early lead. <br/>Yeah, I did. You know, I’m a huge fan, and wearinwearing that necklace,  especially on day 38, is something that you dream about. It was tough, and I may replay that challenge for a long time. <br/>Jeff: Ben, you had more shots on goal than anybody. And you could not close the deal. <br/>An upside down "U" will forever haunt me,  because that was a million-dollar mistake right there. You know, I know I’m on the bottom. It's clear and evident. So I hate to say it is what it is, but if I get snuffed tonight,  I did my best, and I’m proud of my game. And I wouldn't change a thing. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, along with winning today's immunity  challenge, you also won the last secret advantage in the game. Did you keep it a secret or did you share it with anybody? <br/>I did share it. But not with everyone. <br/>Jeff: Ben, you're looking around now. <br/>Yeah, I’m wondering who she shared it with, because it  wasn't me. <br/>She shared it with me. <br/>Same. <br/>That makes sense, though. I mean, I get that. I'm just wondering what it is now. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, do you want to catch the jury up and Ben on  what it says? <br/>Sure. <br/>"Congratulations, you have won an advantage in the  form of information. Tonight, you will choose one person to sit next to you at the  final tribal council, forcing the two remaining players to earn their way to  the end by battling it out in a fire-making challenge."  Wow. <br/>Jeff: So, Chrissy, I’m guessing you thought a lot this  afternoon, given that you shared it with Ryan and Devon. <br/>Well, let me say one thing first. For some of us to be in charge of their own fate, I see the  beauty in that. That said, I hope that it ends in a certain way. <br/>Jeff: All right, Chrissy, you're going to choose one  person that you can guarantee is sitting next to you, and you're  simultaneously leaving the other two to fend for themselves. That third spot will be earned. It won't be just given. Have you made a decision? <br/>I have. <br/>Jeff: All right, let us know what you were doing. <br/>I would like to take Ryan  to the final three. <br/>Jeff: All right, so, Ryan, first of all, how does that  feel to hear that? <br/>It's just a really good feeling. I thank Chrissy. We've been in lockstep a lot of way here. And I get a chance to plead my case to the jury. It feels incredible. <br/>Jeff: Devon, how does that make you feel that you will  have to earn your way to the final three. <br/>I love the feeling. This is my chance to put my fate in my own hands. It feels great. <br/>Jeff: And, ben, your knee is literally bouncing. <br/>This is awesome. You know, I blew it today. And that's all me. But I get a second chance. <br/>Jeff: Literally, a last gasp. <br/>I’m ready to go make some  fire. And I’m going to do my best, and we're going to compete, two  warriors battling it out trying to make a fire. <br/>May the boast man win. <br/>Jeff: All right, so here's how it's going to work. 38 days in, you should know how to make fire. And if you can, it could be worth a million dollars. I'll give you a minute to think started. <br/>Jeff: All right, there is one seat left at the final  three. It's time to find out whose butt will be sitting in it. Ben and Devon, take your spots at the fire-making station. We have chrisy and Ryan already in the final three. First time ever the final spot will be earned by a fire-making  showdown. You each have the exact same supplies. Your job is to build a fire that is high enough and hot enough  to burn through that cord. First person that burns through their cord, that flag raises,  you are sitting at the final three. Loser becomes the eighth and final member of the jury, and you  will be sitting over there. You guys both ready? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Jeff: Good luck. This challenge is on. This could go very fast. <br/>Jeff: This is not like making fire back at camp where  there is not a lot of pressure. This is potentially a million-dollar challenge. Side by side, both guys with the same process. Devon going to go for it first, trying to get a spark, trying to  get that magnesium to go. Ben going to join him, both sparking their flint. Ben has a little something but it goes out. Devon now scraping more magnesium. Ben look for a spark to get something to light. Devon taking a more methodical approach with magnesium, trying  to build a little pile of it, hoping that will ignite. Devon spark big. Trying to get it going. <br/>Devon's got one. <br/>Jeff: Devon's got a little something, but it goes out. Ben continues to strike the knife, and he's got a little something  going. Can he keep it going? BenBen has the first flame, but that's going to go out quickly. Hey he's to get sticks on it and get something to take. Ben has more flame, has some sticks on there. Can he keep it going? Devon striking faster now. Working hard trying to get something going. Fire starting to burn for ben. <br/>Devon, you're still in it. <br/>Jeff: Reactions from chrisy and Ryan now. Everybody's been very open about what they want to have happen. Ben is the only one who wants Ben to win. Everybody else pulling for Devon. Ben now pulling out the bigger pieces. And that's going to help lock that fire in. Devon continue to strike. Faster and faster, trying to get something going. Ben's flame is burning high now, and it's starting to hit that  cord. Ben is very close right now. Ben getting closer. That flame getting taller and burning hotter now. Will it be enough? Yes! Ben wins the fire showdown and earns the final seat at tribal  council in a dramatic win against Devon. <br/>Good luck to you. <br/>Jeff: Devon, sadly for you, this is the end. 38 days on "Survivor" is as far as you will go. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Devon, you become the eighth and final member of our  jury. The tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Good job, dev. <br/>Jeff: Well, congratulations. You have made it to the final three. Chrissy, ben, Ryan. Tomorrow, the power in the game shifts to the jury. Eight people that you had a hand in voting out of the game will  now decide which one of you they think is most deserving of the title of  "Sole Survivor" and the million dollars that goes with it. You have one more night out here. I hope you get some good sleep because are you going to need it  tomorrow. Grab your torches, head back to camp, good night. <br/>Oh, man, it's a bummer to go home at this point. One day short, making final three. But, congrats to ben. He killed it in that fire challenge. Even though I lost, at least my fate lied in my hands, and I went  out with a big bang. No matter what happens to me, I’m a stronger man, and I just  feel blessed to have had this experience. I'm walking away from here happy. [ cheers and applause ]. <br/>Jeff: You gotta love Devon. Not many people would look at a fire-making showdown as an opportunity. He's one of the most popular players of the season. Devon, come on out. [ cheers and applause ] look at that. Standing ovation. All right, have a seat, guys. I don't know if we were on that or not, but everybody stood up. So, first, just what is that like? Because you're just this young man. You come out to play this crazy game. When people come up to you, what is it they say they're  connecting with, this love? <br/>I've got nothing but good feedback, Jeff. It's beautiful. I feel so grateful to # just to have gotten this whole  experience and all the positive love. <br/>Jeff: Is it moms, dads, kids, everybody? <br/>Yeah, the best is just when a parent tells me about how  their kid loves me and looks up to me. I just feel so honored to be a positive role model. [ cheers and applause ]  Jeff: It's really interesting. Mike was out here, and he said, "I thought about voting for  Devon, but I didn't." you did. So you're playing the game. And then when Chrissy, you know, some would say dumped the  responsibility on you, because she was in good shape. She had earned her way to the end. Now she needed you to help her. You didn't say, "Wow, why does Ryan get to go?" you  said, "I love it. It's an opportunity" guys look at this as game play,  nothing else, just a game. <br/>It is just a game. It's all fun, and to just be able to get out there and play the  game. I was already blessed just to even be present. So-- and to make it as far as I did. <br/>Jeff: I watched Devon backstage watching that fire-making  challenge. First time you've seen it. And you were eye don't know if you know, but you were  transfixed. What-- just what is that feeling when you're watching what you  know happened, but you haven't seen it? <br/>Yeah, it brought me back, definitely. It brought back all of the emotion I was feeling and everything. And I’m super stoked for ben. I mean, he deserved to be in the final three. He's the man. <br/>Jeff: And that's why everybody loves Devon. All right, and in case you're wondering, that final four twist  is not a one-off. That is a part of the show. So you can expect to see it again next season. Devon, the final member of the jury. We have our final three-- Chrissy, Ryan, ben, final tribal  council is next! Âª âª  There it is, day 39. I'm going to the tree. <br/>Have fun. <br/>Day 39. <br/>Day 39. <br/>I’m marking the tree,  dude. <br/>I’m sitting here on day  39 of "Survivor," as a super fan. My dream potentially four votes away from winning a million  dollars and the title of "Sole Survivor." it's really a dream come  true. <br/>I just got chills. <br/>We made it. <br/>Strategically, it hasn't gone exactly how I anticipated it  going, but I was with the game every step along the way and had to control my  way to the end, luke a true Hustler does, and I think I did that. Last Hustler standing. I think I’m the underdog going into this tribal council, so I need  to persuade the jury I had control of the game entire. Now, that's a complete lie. But I think if might work. Oh, my God! <br/>I see a clean frying pan,  eggs! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Milk, sausages. Champagne. Day one, I was terrified. I threw up at the first immunity challenge. That's how terrified I was. <br/>Final three. <br/>Final three. <br/>Final three. Cheers, you all. <br/>Who would know I would tie the record for most immunity  challenges won by a woman in "Survivor" history. I killed it. It was a fun ride. <br/>It's a ride, for sure. <br/>The ride is not over yet. Of course, the game is not over yet. I have some fierce competition, but I am a mom, so I’m an  everyday Hero. I think I deserve to win tonight. I think I played a Heroic game. And I want other moms to know they should always dream in  themselves and believe in their dreams because eventually they may just come  true. <br/>Everybody happy? <br/>You know, I've never let off the gas. I've been full throttle 100% from day one. This game and I are like two peas in a pod. Being in the marines, I've been through a lot of battles in  life, and tonight is going to be a battle. Because Ryan is a good talker. And Chrissy won four immunity challenges. I have to go in humble but confident. My game's been about providing for my family more than  anythinges, and at the end of the day I need to bring a paycheck home to my  wife and my two kids. I've never had a million-dollar night. And I probably never will again. This is the biggest night of my life. This is the biggest night of my life. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of your jury. Desi. Cole. JP. Joe. Lauren. Ashley. Mike. And Devon, eighth and final member of our jury. Welcome to the final tribal council. Council. Chrissy, ben, Ryan, tonight will be your biggest battle because  tonight the power shifts to the jury. They will decide who deserves the title of "Sole Survivor"  and the million dollars that goes along with it. Final tribal council is centered around the three aspects of the  game: Outwit, outplay, outlast. Outwit is the social part of the game-- your relationships,  alliances, relationships outside of those alliances. The outplay is how did you deal with the conditions put on you  by the game? You have to compete in challenges. There are switches and twists tw and advantages. And the last and maybe the most important part is outlast. Did you put on the jury people who respect how you outwitted and  outplayed more than the two people sitting next to you. I'm going to give you a minute to gather your thoughts. We'll get started. <br/>Jeff: All right, well, they said it all. Now it comes down to the jury votes. Oh, you have a buff on. This is perfect. <br/>Ava. <br/>Jeff: That's my daughter's name. So, I have's question for you: Do you know who you would vote  for? <br/>Jeff: Yes. <br/>Okay, here's a piece of "Survivor--" real deal--  here's a "Survivor" pen. Don't show anybody. Use my back. Write down the name. Don't anybody say anything. And then we're going to see if you agree with the majority of  the jury. Okay? Don't say anything. Fold it up. Okay, keep that. Next time I see you, I will have the votes. It's the "Survivor" finale live from los angeles. <br/>Jeff: Okay, Chrissy, ben, Ryan, let's get started with the  who wants to get us started. Desi. <br/>All right, great. So, congratulations to all three of you for being here in this  position. Chrissy, hats off to you for winning four individual ben, hats  off to you for getting idols and know continuing in the game. But I have to say, Ryan, it feels as if everybody felt they  could beat you at the final three and that's why you're sitting here tonight  so I'd like to give you the student to convince us as to why you're sitting  here based upon your social game? <br/>Sure. So everything in my game emanated from the social game. I found the advantage on day one on the boat. I used that advantage to build a relationship with Chrissy and Devon  and that was a social game play on my part. Now, the seven, I feel like was actually my idea. I conjured it because I had strong inclinations and I had game  moves based on the advantage and the relationships that I could build with  that advantage to move forward in the game and form that seven going into the  merge with the numbers. So I had to depend on factors that I’m good at. I had to depend on the social relationships that I could build  with people. That was my strength in the game. <br/>Then, I would like to know why you may have felt that it  was wise to then never have a single strategic conversation with me? You know, that shows a fault in your social game because you put  me on the jury. <br/>I don't have a strategic  relationship with you. The relationship would parlay into the social relationship. But a lot of the conversation that I had with you was filtered  through Devon. <br/>Devon, can you cosine on any of this? <br/>Yeah, uh--  I mean, this is a big  deal. Ryan's sitting in the hot seat, and you might make or break what  happens. <br/>Up until the alliance of seven, Ryan's social play was  used through me. <br/>There was a communication with Ryan when I got blindsided  when you guys flipped? <br/>Ryan did not know about that. <br/>Yeah, that's another good point. I did not know about the JP vote. I did not know about the Joe vote. JP was one of my closest allies at the time. <br/>I’m glad we started with  the outwit because, honestly, Ryan, I didn't realize you were the puppet  master when it came to Devon. You put him as a front. No one expected you, and Devon got the heat. I respect the play and I appreciate it. <br/>I feel like some of these  tribals people make pitches and rah-rah-pitches to the jury. And king ben--  I want to go with king  ben. Ben, your social gaisms horrible. You and I never comiewctd. The only conversation I recall is you yelling at me. And Chrissy, you and our relationship-- boafgths you are fans. You understood that at some point we would be here. And you focused on challenges and idols and chaos, and forgot  one of the most important aspects of "Survivor."  You're right. This social aspect of it is all new to me. There was a time when I couldn't even sit at a christmas dinner  with my own family, let alone sit on a beach with a bunch of strangers and  play a social game. I'm out here learning how to interact with you guys and  strangers, not only as a game play, but just trying to-- just trying to  better myself as-- as a friend and a man. You know? <br/>I can answer? <br/>Sure. <br/>Yeah, so I think that I just had a totally different  social game than neez guys who planned many, many alliances and wanted to  blindside this person, that person. I got to the final three, frankly, by being loyal to my  alliances. I stayed loyal to Ryan the entire time. I stayed loyal to JP. I had no idea he was going to be blindsided. So my game was not to go out and make a million different moves. As far as the other aspect of social goes, I really did try and  get to know each of you individually, and I still could probably tell every  single one of you personal details about your life, like real things. <br/>Tell me my real thing. <br/>So what-- okay, one of the reasons you don't want to get  married is because your parents got divorced when you were young, and that  was horrible for you, and you don't think that marriage works. <br/>Jeff: Cole, where do you weigh in on the social part of  the game? <br/>Right, so I want to focus on Ben here for a minute. I know I was a target of yours based on some food issues that  went down. <br/>Right. <br/>I'll go ahead and admit to everyone that I did eat myself  a little extra peanut butter. You managed to paint a picture of me being a thief, and it put a  huge target on my back. <br/>Right. <br/>However, if you can just clear my name then I would be  like, well, that was a brilliant social strategic move. <br/>Well, yes, I did paint you a target because you were  physically strong, killing it in all the challenges, and if that was the only  way I could get people to turn on you, well, I’m going to use that. Nothing personal against you--  No, Cole, it went beyond just painting a target on your  back about food. He had something, a vendetta against you. <br/>No. <br/>Who really want respected you? Who did you have the best conversations with? Who didn't you get into an argument with? <br/>Me. <br/>No, it was a strategic move. And you and I talked man to man and I own that. I said I have to work on the social game and sat on the beach  with Lauren and Devon and told stories I haven't told friends back home. I opened up with Mike. I told stories. That's real. This is my life. <br/>Ben, you're saying you told people a lot of things but Chrissy  genuinely reached out and asked about people. And that's huge socially. People want to talk about themselves. She just spit out information about Joe's childhood. I remember hearing her having these conversations thinking this  woman's a genius. <br/>Thank you, Ashley. And I think we know Mike and I had a great social connection. Devon and I had a great social connection. Cole, and you, you got a 34 on your s.A.T. <br/>You can go about making friendships with heme but it's how  you use the friendships and relationships you made during the game and I don't  know that about you. <br/>Getting to know people here was part of my game play. Learning what made you tick to see if I sort of agreed with your  philosophy on how to win this game. For example, Devon, when I got to know Devon--  It was through me! <br/>Ryan, just because your body is present doesn't mean other  people always have a relationship through you. <br/>But you didn't--  You're just making a lot of  I’m not making a lot of  statements. <br/>That we are now finding out are not actually accurate. So he is going to--  As far as this goes, the small he said/she said stuff is  not making an impact on the decision. <br/>I want to say something  on a human level to each you. I am extremely proud of each and every one of you all for making  it this far. We still respect each and every one of you and I want to remind  you to take a step back and realize this is just a game. Outside and this game you can still trust the people around you. <br/>I really appreciate you  saying that because it wasn't directed at just them. It was directed at all of us. <br/>I thank you for all that,  but we had a great day. <br/>That's good. Let's move on. <br/>Jeff: We will move on to the outplay part of the game. This is how you respond to the conditions of the gameue have to  build a shelter. You have to compete in challenges. There are twists, switches, advantages, how you respond to those  is now what they will question you with b. Who wants to go first? Cole. <br/>As a wilderness guy myself, the survival skills mean a lot  to me, building the shelter, making a fire, and I respect the hell out of Chrissy  for winning four challenges. That's extremely impressive. Ben, you found all of your idols and played them perfectly. Ryan, you haven't done much around camp. There have not been a lot of survival skills demonstrated. Just being honest with you. <br/>That's right. I can't argue any of those points you just said. This was the first time I have ever been camping in my entire  life for me so I knew I could not be a provider like JP could. I cannot crack a coconut like everybody else can, I cannot cook  like everybody else can. I have not done any of these things before. I did not want to step on any toes if somebody thought they could  do better. If I went in and burnedlet rice where would that leave me. <br/>I had never tended a fire  or opened a coconut or used a machete or even seen a machete, so for you to  say, I didn't want to try that because it's not what I’m accustomed  to."  You said, you didn't want to mess up. None of us wanted to mess up, either. <br/>But I’m being honest. That's not my strength in the game. <br/>You could have gone to get the water--  Sat around and talked about iced coffee--  You literally hardly ever went for water. <br/>Let's get to the idols and the advantages because we know  at camp life, we're not about that life. <br/>Sure. Let's talk about the advantage first. Day one, I found the advantage on the boat. Then as we said before, I used the advantage to progress to the  end of the game. The story with the idol, which was hidden underneath the flag  back at camp. I dig up the idol, JP was there, I shove it in my pants. Mass chaos enensues --  I had no idea Ryan had  it. <br/>That's why she rode me and jumped on my back. <br/>And I set up that entire situation. <br/>That was well played because it put a bigger target on my  back at the end of it. <br/>Right. And basically I had no choice but to play it once you guys  flushed it. That was the story of the idol. <br/>Would like to say I’m very proud of every female that made  it this far in the game on this jury as well as Chrissy who blew us all away  with winning four. <br/>Desi, Lauren, Ashley, and I took eight of the nine. <br/>I just want to give Chrissy  huge credit for that. <br/>Thank you. So I was terrified when the challenges started. I was not allowed to play sports as a kid. I was told my whole life that I suck at anything physical. I threw up on the deck on the first challenge. Because this was the one thing that I was so scared of. Somehow, I found the courage to just do this. And I’m really proud that there have been 258 female contestants  on "Survivor," and there are now only four that have won four  individual immunities, and I am one of them. I also got two individual rewards and the secret advantage for  the final tribal. <br/>You should be very proud of yourself. <br/>I’m almost 50 years old. <br/>You applied for 16 years and are a proven fact that giving  up is not an option in your book and congratulations. <br/>Thank you, thank you so much. <br/>I mean, we have a queen. We have queen Chrissy, who won four individual immunity  challenges and you continue winning. And I respect that, because just like ben, your back was against  the wall, and you had to win. And I love ben. I love the way you played. Last night it came down to the fire and Devon went home. It took my 10 days to find two idols. You found three in several days. Was it easy or did you put in the work and the effort? <br/>After the blindside against Lauren I knew I was on my own. Had no alliance. Nobody wanted to look at me or be seen talking to me. I chose to get up in the morning before everyone else and go  look. I didn't sit around and watch the sunset, you know. While they were sleeping, I was looking for idols. When I ran out of idols, her secret advantage gave me life, and  I took every opportunity and never quit. The only one that was going to save me was me. So, yes, I put in the time to find the idols. <br/>So here's a better question. There is a point in the game where there were four of you and  then there was ben. How did you all allow Ben the opportunity to go off on his own  this many times to find that many idols? <br/>I was one step ahead on  every idol. These guys went looking at the raft, but I already had it in my  pocket. Mike was looking under the shelter, I already had it in my  pocket. Mike was looking at the rock pit, I had already had int in my  she played a fake idol and I knew it was fake because I already had it in my  pocket. <br/>We tried to trail him--  Four people. <br/>That was a game flaw for all four of us. <br/>Jeff: It is time to move on to the outlaf part of the  game. This shifts back to you guys. Did you put the right people on the jury? Did they respect your outexpwit outplay more than the other two? This is your last moment to make sure the people you put over  there are about to write your name down. Ryan, you want to go first? <br/>Yes, so I could not rely on winning challenges. I knew that going into the game, so I had to build these social  relationships to get me through the early part of the game, and it worked. And I was at 13 out of 15 tribal councils, and my name was never  on the chopping block. And it was not because people wanted to take me to the end. It was because I built enough social relationships and bonds  with people that they wouldn't let my name come up on the chopping block. I think I had more deals to the end than anybody else did, and  that's a credit to my game. They're getting a lot of credit for playing hard, I but I fortified  the social bonds, secured an idol, got an advantage, and I never gave up. That's why I’m sitting here. Nobody dragged me here. Nobody. And--  Ryan, I can disrupt for a second? <br/>Yes. <br/>What you have learned in playing this game? <br/>I learned a lot about  myself. I got rejuvenated when my dad came out here on day 31. That was the best day of my life honestly. This game say confluence of constant emotions overlapping each  other. It's may me realize about myself they value the simplicities of  life, having people close to you, having a family. You all know I’m a huge fan of "Survivor" and it's  been a dream to play the game but I never looked at myself intro spectively  as this game has compelled me to do. <br/>Jeff: Ben. <br/>Mine is going to be short and sweet. Every single one of I had a hand in putting there because you  guys were hurdles. You guys were a hurdle to a million dollars pup were a threat to  me providing for my family, and I respect you guys as threats. But I had to put you in those seats. <br/>Ben, win or lose tonight, you have played one of the best  games in "Survivor" history. And you will be a legend in this game. But I would like to you give us not why you voted us out, but  why you should be the winner tonight? <br/>I have to pigg piggyback  off that. For someone who had his back against the wall for so long. It's almost like you're giving up. I know you're a fighter and I know you have it in you, and I need  more. <br/>Yes, sir, the reason I should be the sole Survivor this  year because after being deemed a king and deemed a dictator by her, I never  quit looking and I never quit battling against all of you all. I was not put here. I got myself here. And I-- I told everyone I was out here for my family, and I am  out here for my family. And I talked about stuff that happened in the military. I came back with p.T.S.D. A lot of combat vets do, and me being out here now is a message  to all those men and women who are struggling that you don't have to feel  alone. You don't have to feel that nobody understands. It's powerful. So if I can be labeled a Hero for showing all those vets that it  can be done and there is happiness, you're going to have to work hard for it. But, you know, it can be done. So...  Jeff: Chrissy. <br/>Okay, I came into this game totally underestimating  myself. And throughout the game, I realized there are times I need to  just say, "I'm awesome at that." and in this case, I’m saying, I kicked  ass challenges. I kicked ass strategically. I think I truth made connections with each of you. I got to the end playing a good, clean, solid game without  leaving a trail of destruction. I did an awesome job. But I want to say all moms are Heroes because they put other  people before themselves. They don't even stop and think. They put themselveses on the line every day. Yes, not like a firefighter or a marine. But it is with great love and no thought that they get in there  and do whatever they have to do for their kids. And so, moms are not only Heroes. But we are also Healers, and we are also Hustlers. So in a way, my game and who I am is all parts of that. And let's not forget the fact that I've been applying for 16  years. The whole thing sunever give up on your dreams. You be can be a 47-year-old mom and freaking do this. Whoever wins this season is the representative of all of us. And I think if you vote me as the winner, you all can feel proud  of me as the winner of your season and something we can all really celebrate. <br/>Jeff: All right, very healthy, candid, challenging final  tribal. Jury, I’m going to give you a moment to take in everything  that's been said, and then we will vote. <br/>Jeff: Okay, so 39 days of "Survivor" comes down  to this one final vote. Jury, you are voting for either Chrissy, ben, or Ryan, whoever  you think played the best game and want to reward with the title of  "Sole Survivor" and a million dollars. For the last time, it is time to vote. Desi, you're up. <br/>I hope you make something  better for a lot of veterans and make me proud. <br/>Coming into the final tribal, I didn't think there was any  way you were going to pull it off, but I’m always rooting for the underdog,  and I hope you win tonight. Good luck. <br/>Although I have many reasons not to vote for each of these  individuals, I believe this one has proven to be the ultimate Survivor that I’m  okay representing our season. <br/>Jeff: For the last time, I'll go get the votes. Thank you all for another great season of "Survivor."  and I will see you back in the states for the reading of the votes. [ cheers and applause ]  Jeff: Don't leave me hanging! Look at you! Look at you! Oh, my God! All the love! Cochran! <br/>Jeff: All right! Thank you, guys. What a fun night. The energy here has been electric. It's all because of you guys. Thank you, really, for another great season of "Survivor."  [ applause ] starterred out a little cagey, you have to admit, a slow burn. <br/>And wasn't sure what would happen, and the game play  kicked in. The greatest parent of the game for me is when social politics  comes full circle and the people that are voted out now are in charge. And the question becomes, "Did you guys do the job you have  to do," which is put the right people on the jury. Let's talk about your games. Ryan. Super fan. Played with such heart that we literally saw your heart beating  through your tiny little chest. [ applause ] during the loved one visit, your dad came out, you  were really open about your bond and that "Survivor" was a shared  experience between you two. Ben, your back has been up against the wall for a long time. A lot of tribals, you never stopped fighting. You were very clear about the reason you were out there. We met your wife. You credit her with saving your life, literally, and you are are  playing for your kids. And you were also very open and vulnerable about the fact that  you wanted other vets who were suffering from p.T.S.D. To see that there is life after combat. <br/>Yes, sir, yes, sir. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, completely different story. A work mom. 47 years old. Applied for 16 years to get out here. You dominated, set records in this game. When we saw your husband-- your husband came out at the loved  one, and we saw a completely different side of you. You said he's the greatest man you've ever known. And you said, "It reminds me when I get back home I want to  put focus back on the family." three completely different reasons for  playing, but all of them got you here. And when you think about Survivor and you dream of playing, this  is it. The essence is could I actually last 39 days? Could I get to the final three and get a chance to plead my case  they deserve it? Amazing accomplishment. Nobody can take that away from you. But there can only be one winner. It's why it's such a great game. These are the votes for the winner of our 35th season of "Survivor."  [ cheers and applause ] first vote. Ben. [ cheers and applause ] Ryan. [ cheers and applause ] one vote ben, one vote Ryan. Chrissy. [ cheers and applause ] one vote ben, one vote Ryan, one vote Chrissy. Chrissy. [ cheers and applause ] two votes Chrissy, one vote ben, one  vote Ryan. Ben. [ cheers and applause ] we are tied again. Two votes Chrissy, two votes ben, one vote Ryan. Clen. [ cheers and applause ] that's three votes ben, two votes Chrissy,  one vote Ryan. One vote left. The winner of "Survivor," ben! [ cheers and applause ]  Jeff: Well, it was a culmination of 39 days right there,  one of the most intense and drank experiences. Ben was on a mission, and while others slept, he was out there  making things happen, looking for idols. He's the only one who could keep a secret. Let me get him. Ben! Ben! Come over here! Get over here! Congratulations, man. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: First of all, that's a million dollars in there. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Jeff: It's got a lot of personal information on there. That is your check. The real deal. <br/>Oh, wow, wow, wow! <br/>Jeff: Let's get the family up. Ben's family, come on. Get the folks up here, everybody up here. Take it in. Gave him a big hug. Look at that. 39 days for this. It takes a lot to win this show. All right, so, ben, ben, come in here. Kelley, get in here. So, you know, your husband left, your son left for six weeks. It's a long time. You have to manage the fort at home. He's out here doing his thing. All the players who have ever played know how tough it is. But when you watch this show over this long, you really can  forget. So just to remind you, here's a recap of all the moves it took Ben  to win this game, and there were a lot. <br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor": On day one, Ben began  the game on the Hero tribe but losing the first immunity challenge-- Hustlers  win immunity! ...Forced Ben to form an early Alines. He chose allen. <br/>I’m not crazy. I'm confidence. <br/>Jeff: But his paranoia caused Ben to form a new alliance  with Chrissy, who became a strong ally and worthy adversary. <br/>Chris sesmart, and that's going to help me get further in  the game. On day nine... We are switching tribes. ...A surprise switch left Ben the lone Hero on a new tribe. <br/>I have to earn respect  and gain trust to keep my butt in the game. <br/>Jeff: Ben had to rely on his social game to persuade Lauren,  a Hustler, and Ryan, a Healer to form a new alliance. <br/>I think Lauren and doc  have the same agenda I do. At the merge, Ben reuniteunited Chrissy and together together  they formed a majority alliance of Heroes and Hustlers, and took control of  the game. <br/>Moving forward, it's going to be blindsides and lies. <br/>Jeff: Their alliance controlled the vote for several  tribal councils. Jessica, bring me your torch. Desi. NiCole. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Good game, bud. <br/>Jeff: But nothing lasts forever on "Survivor."  I mean, there's one  person running the game now, and that's ben. <br/>Jeff: Joe recognized Ben was becoming a real threat to win  the game so he painted a target on ben's back. <br/>They're going on aim for you right off the bat. <br/>Ben seven, Lauren six. <br/>Jeff: This forced Ben to form a suballiance. Ben went under cover. <br/>Obviously, Ben is with us. <br/>Who do you guys want to vote for? I'm doing my best double-agent act. <br/>Jeff: And his new alliance blindsided... Tenth person  voted out JP. <br/>Jeff: ...His former alliance. <br/>The whole thing was a sham. <br/>Jeff: The game changed again when Ben senses his new  alliance was coming for him. <br/>Ben has to go. <br/>Asap. <br/>Jeff: And now Ben was on his own. <br/>My wife led me to this one, so I’m going to go ahead and  play this one. <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. <br/>Good game, Lauren. <br/>Jeff: With only five days left, everybody wanted Ben out. <br/>The longer that guy is in the game, the longer he could  find an idol. <br/>Jeff: But it wouldn't be easy. <br/>No way! <br/>Jeff: Ben was relentless. <br/>Should we just church this up and gets to the point  because I’m not going home tonight. <br/>Ben is like the bad guy in any horror movie-- he keeps  coming back to life. <br/>Jeff: And while everyone else slept, Ben was fighting for  his life and found a third idol. <br/>Oh, my God! You think I’m going home? Watch this! [ whistles ] [ explosion ] la-la-la. <br/>Jeff: With no more idols in the the game... Something is  not right. Ben lost the final immunity challenge to his former ally, Chrissy. <br/>A million dollars was at stake. I just let it slip away. <br/>Jeff: But a new twist in the game gave Ben one last shot  to make it to the final three. <br/>Jeff: Ben wins! Ben seized the moment. And on day 39, faced his final obstacle-- the jury. <br/>I never quit looking, and  I never quit battling against all of you all. I was not put here. I got myself here. <br/>Make something better for a lot of veterans. [ applause ]. <br/>Jeff: There gu! That is what it takes. Watching that back, do you remember how arduous the journey is? <br/>Oh, it was-- it was so hard. Having, you know, my back up against the wall. I had to fight every single day, every morning, every night. <br/>Jeff: You know, talk about that. Because one of the things people ask me a lot is finding idols. How do you keep finding idols? Will you put in perspective you were looking and looking and  looking. <br/>You have to go out and find the idol. If you're not look for it, you won't find it. Every morning I went out and looked for the idol, and I never  gave up. I never quit, and I was-- the early bird gets the worm, I guess. <br/>Jeff: Well, congratulations, well earned. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Jeff: Really great having you on the show. That is what it takes. It was a crazy season because on one hand, you had Chrissy, who  was a dominant force. And then on the other hand, you had players like Lauren, who  gave away her idol and then got vote out that night. And that mistake, by the way, is a nod toward what we're doing  next season, and I’m so excited with what we're doing next season, I can't  wait-- I want to give you a little taste, just a few seconds, whet your  appetite. <br/>Jeff: Oh, it's going to be good. We're going to clear the stage, we'll get some chairs and we'll  get to gettin'. Thed is vie live finale from l.A.
