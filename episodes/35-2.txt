<br/>Previously on "Survivor," at the Healer tribe, Joe  interrogated  I personally think you  have the idol. <br/>I wish I did. <br/>Mike is public enemy number one. <br/>At the Hustler tribe, Patrick found his partner in crime. <br/>I got your back. <br/>I got you back if you got  mine. <br/>Jeff: And Ryan confessed to having the super idol. <br/>If we don't go to trial, I have to give it to someone  else. <br/>Jeff: The Hero tribal was facing tribal council, and a  core four came together. <br/>I wanted us four from the  beginning. <br/>Jeff: Which put the two moms on the outs? <br/>Do you think it's you because I think it's me? <br/>Jeff: But Chrissy received Ryan's super idol. <br/>It can only be used at tonight's tribal council. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Alan accused JP And Ashley of being a power couple. <br/>To have the term "Power couple" even thrown  around is ridiculous. <br/>I know what I know, and I’m  in the crazy. I'm confident. <br/>Jeff: In the end, the alliance of four stuck together. Katrina, the tribe has spoken. And Chrissy decided not to save Katrina, holding on to her  secret but now powerless idol. 17 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>I’m happy to take a walk  to the watering hole. <br/>I'll get water at night before I go to tribal again. Let's never go there again. <br/>That was brutal. <br/>I never want to go again. <br/>Tribal council was really heated and angry. Great for me, right? I started out on the bottom. Now I think that I’m no longer on the bottom because all these  other cracks come up because people do it to themselves. <br/>Wow. Good job. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I was also glad that I did  not use the super immunity id.L. -- idol, because in the future I can use it as a decoy. It has no power, but it still has power. <br/>I don't plan on going  back to that. <br/>Not at all. <br/>Tribal council was intense. I mean, I was not expecting fists to start flying like that. But at the end of the day, I think I got what I wanted in terms  of people really thinking that Ashley and JP Are a power couple, so my plan worked essentially, like whether  I’m right or whether I’m wrong, I think I created some kind of suspicion. A lot of times suspicion gets you the results you want. <br/>First of all, how do you convince people of something when  you have in proof? You know what I mean? I'm trying to convince you I don't have something and that me  and JP Are not... As soon as the word "Power couple" got  thrown into it, oh, my gosh, that's crazy. The whole spectacle that Alan created tonight at tribal council  just kind of showed everyone how off the hinges he really is. I'm not going to sit become and tell my whole tribe that I’m in  a power duo with JP And we're hiding idols. I think he went from a really safe place with the core four to  now putting a huge target on his back. <br/>Do you guys believe me? <br/>I’m starting to believe  you more. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Alan has to keep it under wraps period. <br/>He has. To I I don't understand what he's doing. <br/>The group is like old paint. It's cracked and fractured everywhere. I'm not sure who I can trust. The core four is gone. The perception might be there in some people's heads, not  actually, no, it's not. It's done. The whole thing is shot. Now it's every man for himself. <br/>Look at that, baby. <br/>Okay. <br/>We have definitely as the days have gone on really owned  the Hustler mantra. I cobust my bum. The Hustler tribe is feeling really good about itself. We have some momentum now. I think I’m in a pretty good spot socially. I feel like me and you are doing okay. <br/>We're doing good. <br/>We're doing okay. <br/>I think we're the best  players in our tribe. <br/>For sure. <br/>Everyone else, when I talk to them, I’m not smiling when I  I’m like, oh, okay, I’m all serious. But with you I’m able to talk strategy and have a smile on my  face. <br/>I think we're tight. We're lock-step. We've gotten along so well. Honestly, I feel like I've connected with everybody on my tribe,  maybe nazi moan, but I don't think anybody has a connection with Simone. She's weird, and weirdness, you want to blend in on these first  couple days, and the people who blend in the best are the ones that escape. <br/>I did it! Yes. Oh, my God. But it was terrifying. I'm not an outside person. The fact that I was leaving myself in the water was the biggest  milestone. I can't believe I did that. I feel like a super Hero. <br/>Awesome. <br/>And that's your superpower. <br/>Yeah. I know people think this is paradise. But it's tough out here and it's hot all the time and there is  no air conditioning. I hate the outside. <br/>You hate the outside in we're outside right now. <br/>We're in the outside. <br/>I’m challenging myself. I'm having an adventure. I'm trying to try new things. I think people look at me and think here is this person who has  no experience in the outdoors, but, you know, I’m a Hustler because I’m good  under pressure. <br/>So who is going to gut the fish? <br/>I'll clean the fish. I've never done it before. <br/>You've never done it before? <br/>I read up on how to do  it. <br/>Just don't cut your finger. You got it. <br/>All right. Get it. <br/>"Survivor" might push me to my limits, but I've  been playing "Survivor" my entire life. I live on a tribe. I have ten brothers and sisters, so I was fighting constantly to  outperform everybody. <br/>Nice. <br/>All right. <br/>Hey, you did a good job. <br/>I plan on gaining  everybody's respect by just working hard, because this is the Hustler tribe. This is the work ethic tribe. <br/>How have you been doing, Simone? <br/>I've been adjusting. <br/>Gutting that fish, that's a big deal. I can tell you're putting yourself out there, you're putting  yourself out there to do things you normally wouldn't do. <br/>This game is all about handling different personalities. I think it's something I’m good at, and I don't know if everyone  is thinking, oh, Simone is the diva, I don't want to deal with, that but I see  Simone's value at this time. Being here with a whole bunch of random people is a big step for  her. I definitely could use that to my advantage and kind of pull Simone  on to my side. You keep doubting yourself. I think you need to be more optimistic in how you think. If you think less of you, other people will think less. You have to hype yourself up, because if you don't, who else  will? I could see her being loyal for a long time. I could definitely mold her. I'm here to win. So I feel like Simone, I could use as putty in my hands. <br/>This is the worst game of cat and mouse ever. <br/>Yes. <br/>It's really frustrating. I keep shooting at the same one. <br/>It will happen. <br/>I feel so disappointed. <br/>Don't. <br/>I want the try again. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think Jessica is super  cute, although she just turned 30, so she probably sees me as some little kid  and doesn't even give me a sideways look, but she's a great person to be  around. I'm digging the energy a lot. I think I make too much noise. Sometimes I talk to them. <br/>That's super cute. We do flirt a lot. Maybe if I keep catching her fish, she'll come over. She's a cool girl. Like I could see myself with her. <br/>You were miss virginia twice. <br/>When were you miss virginia? What year? <br/>I was miss virginia 2013  in the american system and 2014 in the u.S.A. System. <br/>We're on the wrong tribe, and there's a beauty tribe. We the ugly ones. <br/>Everyone on this tribe except me is hot and smart. <br/>You definitely have the smarts, bro, the beauty, you is  one ugly dude, but you're still smart. <br/>Thanks. <br/>I’m okay with that. <br/>We're definitely in the wrong tribe, Mike. My relationship with Mike is he's still my public enemy number  one, but he's definitely growing on me. He's a likable guy and I kind of like him, but not enough to  keep him around. So I’m still feeding everyone that Mike has the idol. I truly don't know if he has the idol or not, so now it's kind  of almost like backfired on me because now I can't look for the idol as much  as I want the look for the idol. So I’m trying to figure ways to leave camp. <br/>All right. Are we well,? <br/>See you in ten, Joe. <br/>Cool. <br/>The window is a very, very small window. But, you know, I could accomplish a lot of things in a small  time. <br/>I wonder how long we've  been gone. <br/>A couple hours. <br/>Wow. There it is. It's a clue. Ocean, looks like a raft, five feet, I found a clue. And it looks like a map to the idol. I think it's a raft. It looks like a raft. When I see it, automatically I think of Cole. Cole has been out there fishing. So I’m going to talk about it with him. Hopefully he opens up to me. If not he'll definitely trust me that I’m giving him some  information. <br/>I haven't really explored. <br/>Right. <br/>But I found an idol clue today. <br/>Really? <br/>It's marked on a tree. So it's in the a physical clue. It's a square, like a raft, and it said, ocean, five feet. You've been out there swimming all day. I just assumed you had it and didn't tell nobody, which is cool. <br/>I haven't gotten it yet. <br/>It's there. <br/>Where is the clue? <br/>It's all the way in the back where the rocks are. <br/>Joe brought me in on the fact there's a clue I can't see. I am beside myself. This is the greatest day ever so far, and this is why I’m here  the play Survivor is to find the id.L. And have the power, but I’m suspicious that the idol is on the  raft because I've been out fishing all day. So I’m like, dude, I need to see this clue. <br/>That's the clue. Five feet, ocean, raft. <br/>No, no, no, no, no,. That's the symbol for the well on the map. That's the symbol for the well. So five feet from the well, x marks the spot. That's the symbol for the well. Dude, it's second nature for me to enable people and help them  accomplish their goals. That skill set I feel like is giving me power in this game. Since Joe would have never found that out by himself, he  probably sees me as a really good resource now. <br/>Showing Cole the clue was a major risk, but I needed help. Like I don't honestly think I would have figured it out on my  own. <br/>It's now or never. <br/>In my mind if anything pops out of that ground, I’m snatching  it. I want it. And I’m going to find it today. <br/>Got it. <br/>Yeah. I got the idol. It feels good. I feel good. <br/>That's the idol. <br/>Now I know no one else has it, but I’m concerned because  the fact that Cole knows I have the idol can absolutely backfire. It's all about power and knowledge. He has too much knowledge. I don't think he's going to use it against me, but at the same  time, if he does, I might have to put target on his back. <br/>It's all about getting things done and taking care of  business. So I’m out fishing, trying to get some board, and just one step  at a time and go from there. <br/>He's walking up with something. I think that's a lobster. <br/>No way. <br/>It's something. He got something. <br/>I have never really been  super big enter drama or the confrontational type or anything like that, so  if I can get some fish, some lobster, things like, that make sure everybody  has a full belly, I think everyone will be happy and taken care of. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Nicely done. <br/>That is meat. <br/>That is delicious. <br/>The other night at tribal, ash and I got called out as the  power couple. That label sucks. I don't see ourselves as a power couple at all. We're not dating. We're not hooking up. We're not doing any of that type of stuff. If we're a power couple, we might as well hook up and be a  couple. Might as well take advantage of everything. So ash and my connection is more on the backburner now, but in  the fire house, that's what my profession is, staying calm in an emergency  situation. I might not be the guy out there talking strategy to everybody,  but I know that I need to clean my rep up a little with bit and straighten  things out. <br/>Obviously ash and I don't have an idol and obviously ash  andry not a couple. How is everything else going? <br/>Good. I'm feeling good. <br/>Good. <br/>I needed to get through  that first tribal so I could get a foothold and I got through it. Now I really this believe that I can go far in this game. I just need to figure out who I want to move forward with,  because I do believe that you need a strong partner to get to the end of the  game. <br/>What about game? <br/>Let's pretend me and you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>People would never say he would go with her and she would  go with him. <br/>We wouldn't get labeled a power couple. <br/>That's true. <br/>You know what I mean? <br/>So what I do as an actuary is analyze data and figure out  what is my next best moving giving everything I know some here's what I know  -- JP Can be helpful in challenge, but truthfully I don't think he's  that smart. I think JP And Alan both want each other out almost. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>I’m worried Alan wants me  out. <br/>Ashley is a very good player, but I don't entire trust Ashley. I am not convinced there is not a power couple. <br/>We're solid? <br/>Yeah, we're solid. <br/>Then after Alan had his blow-up, I’m concerned about  having a twosome with Alan. At this point the data shows that Ben is a better option for me. Ben has a lot of social charm, and I can think several steps  ahead strategically, so together we complement each other very well. Right now we have two options, you, me, and Ashley, or you, men,  and Alan. Let Alan think he's with us. Let Ashley think she's with us. JP Doesn't talk to anybody. Who knows what the heck his game is. <br/>As we stay together. <br/>You and me, yes. <br/>This is crazy how this is going. <br/>Totally crazy. <br/>Alan and I were Aligned from the get-go. But after he blew up at tribal the other night, I don't know if  I can work with him. Chrissy is a smart woman, and she has a good head on her  shoulders. That's going to help me get further in the game. I'm in. Like this is crazy. We're good. We're safe. <br/>We can totally ride this out the entire way. We can ride it out the entire way. <br/>At this point Chrissy andry in the driver's seat, and  whatever we decide to do is what's going to happen. So let's do this. <br/>Let's do it. Let's totally do it. <br/>But no more talking between you and I. <br/>No, we are not a power couple. <br/>I don't even know you. <br/>Huge crab. Look at that! This thing has claws like enormous. I got us a meal. <br/>Geez, look at those claws. Grab it, dude. <br/>Ow! <br/>Has he got you? <br/>Are you hurt. <br/>No. <br/>What is your problem? <br/>What is wrong with you? Why do you have to do that Alin my face. <br/>They're so scary. I'm scared of crabs. So I should probably continuinger my fear because I’m a lot  bigger than that crab. <br/>He's moving. <br/>What is he going to do. <br/>Holy geez. <br/>I’m a wild banshee. I'm someone what wants to have a good time all the time. My strategy is to keep everyone having fun. When you do that, you don't have to worry about being the  bull's-eye. <br/>Dancing skills, what would you say your dancing skills are  like? <br/>Zero. <br/>You do any performing at night? What about in the shower? <br/>No, I might fall and break my neck. <br/>Patrick is starting to get on my nerves. He wants to be in the spotlight. <br/>I'll do my australian accent. Want to put some shrimp on the barbie. We'll mingle. <br/>Sit still. He's too loud for me. His volume is at a ten. He needs to be about a volume two. He is a big kid. He's a 25-year-old boy. [farts] you can look him dead in the face and say, Patrick, do  not touch, that an he will look at you and touch it. You know, it's like really? I can't just come out and say, shut the hell up, just because I am  older, I think they would want to stick together. It's very tough for me. I'm in the a social butterfly. To be a commercial fisherman, you work alone. I don't want to be exploited, so I’m trying to build a  relationship with Ali, trying to get on the same page with her. I just want to see that you andry on the same page, you know  what I mean? The more you think about it, Patrick's going to start wearing on  us after a while. It's hard to not get short with him. <br/>Yeah, it definitely is. It makes me nervous. <br/>Patrick's name is starting to come up. It's so early. How am I supposed to come up if Patrick is getting on people's  nerves and he's nuts. <br/>He's just so adamant on everything. <br/>Yeah. With Patrick, I feel like I’m babysitting a lot. I don't want that to be my job. I'm here to play for me, not anybody else. I think I have to definitely think about where we stand and how  important this relationship is, because if people decide to vote Patrick out,  I don't think I need him in this game anymore. <br/>Jeff: All right. Healers and Hustlers getting your first look at the Hero tribe. Katrina voted out at first tribal council. <br/>Chrissy does not know I’m the one that gave that to her. I don't know how that first tribal went. Maybe she used it and that's why she's still there, but I hope  she sticks around so I can get an opportunity to use that connection down the  road. <br/>Jeff: All right. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First things first, I need to take back the idols. Thank you. Thanks, Mike. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, three members of each tribe are going to  swim out to a floating net ring. You'll then dive down and maneuver a bundle of puzzle pieces  through a cage. Once you've collectedded all three bundles, the two remaining  tribe members will use those pieces to solve a signpost puzzle. First two tribes to finish win immunity, safe from the vote. In addition, you're playing for reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: First tribe the finish, the ultimate "Survivor"  fishing kit. <br/>All right. <br/>Jeff: You've been catching fish, this will take it to the  next level. Traps, net, knife, line, lures, sinkers. Second tribe to finish, smaller but still effective, lines,  lures. Last tribe to finish, nothing but a date with me at tribal  council where somebody will be the second person voted out of this game. Healers, you have one extra member. Going to sit somebody out? Who is it going to be? <br/>Joe. <br/>Jeff: Joe is going to sit this one out. Hustlerring going to sit someone out, who is it going to be? Lauren. Everyone else take a minute to strategize and we'll get started. <br/>Jeff: All right. Here we go for immunity and reward, Survivors ready? Go! First you got to swim that life ring to the buoy. Then you got to dive down, unto a bundle of puzzle pieces, and  then maneuver it through the cage. Hustlers get there first. Healers are there. Heros are there. Ashley comes up empty handed. JP Down for the Heroes. Devon quickly up for the Hustlers. <br/>Let's go! Come on, guys. <br/>Jeff: Devon going under again for the Hustlers. They're out to an early lead. Paul is up without a bundle. Now Roark in the water for the Healers. Heroes have their first burn l. <br/>Mice job, guys! Here comes Roark with the first bundle for the Healers. It is now Jessica going down. All three tribes now with one bundle. Devon back up with the second bundle. Hustlers with one bundle left. JP Has a second bundle for the Heroes. The Healers stuck at one right now. Jessica comes up empty handed. Cole going to go back down now for the Healers. Devon has the third bundle of puzzle pieces for the Hustlers. Hustlers can head back. Hustlers with a huge lead right now. The Healers have their second bundle. They've got one left. Roark going back down. JP Has the third bundle of puzzle pieces for the Heroes. They can start swimming their pieces in. The Hustlers with a nice lead. Got to get everybody up here and the pieces on the platform. Healers still looking for that third bundle. Healers falling way behind now. Heroes got to get all your pieces and everybody on the platform. Cole has the third bundle for the Healers. Healers can now start swimming in. <br/>Nice work, nice work! <br/>Jeff: Hustlers can start working on their buzzell. It is Ali and Simone for the Hustler tribe. Heroes have all their pieces free. They can start solving. <br/>Ali, I’m going to need  your help banging these in. <br/>Jeff: It is now Alan and Chrissy. Heroes working to make up some time lost under water. Got to get everybody up here and on the platform with your  pieces. Your signpost puzzle contains the names of places Survivors  visited over the years. Hustlers our to an early lead. <br/>Too long. <br/>Jeff: Heroes trying to get in this and the Heroes now can  get in it. Everyone now working on their signpost puzzle. The goal is you want to spin that so it doesn't hit any of the  obstacles. As long as that's working, you're good. <br/>We good, we good, we good. We good. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: Heroes got to try something else. <br/>Right here. <br/>Okay, which is the shorteddest? <br/>Jeff: Healers, that won't work. You will have to swap out. There's a lot of trial and error. If it were easy, it would not be "Survivor."  Okay. Cambodia. <br/>Switch cam benda and philippines. <br/>Jeff: The Hustler tribe getting close. Heroes still trying new combinations. They think they're close. Healers with one piece left. Hustlers with one piece left. The question is where does it go  Right there, put that there. <br/>Jeff: Simone and Ali hope they have it. No, something is not right. <br/>Not there, not there, Simone. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: Simone and Ali have had a huge head start, but it's  evaporated now. We're dead even. Anybody can still pull this out. <br/>Desi, Desi. Behind you! <br/>Jeff: Hustlers still working with their last piece. No, another block. Something still not right. <br/>Find which pieces need to go where, Simone. <br/>Cambodia. Cambodia. <br/>Jeff: Healers now getting some momentum again. If they're right...  Keep spinning. <br/>Jeff: Healers think they have it. <br/>Jeff! <br/>Jeff: They do. Healers win immunity for the second time in a row. <br/>Let's go, baby. <br/>Jeff: We're looking for one more. <br/>Go to go back. It is now the Heroes versus the Hustlers. <br/>Okay. Anyone? Which one, which one? <br/>Jeff: All the pressure on Ali and Simone. You better be right if you're on the puzzle. <br/>Put that piece back. Yeah. <br/>No, it's way too small, guys. <br/>Try it. <br/>Jeff: Patrick yelling out orders to Ali. <br/>Too long. <br/>Jeff: It's wrong. Another block. <br/>Get down, Simone. <br/>You just observe, Simone. <br/>Jeff: Heroes trying a new series of pieces. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: And they've got it. Heroes win immunity and reward, sending the Hustlers to tribal  council. Healer tribe, who wants to come get it? <br/>There we go, Cole. <br/>Jeff: Nice job. Nobody going home once again from the Healer tribe. And a big fishing reward will be waiting for you back at camp. <br/>Yay! <br/>Jeff: Hero tribe, somebody come get it. <br/>Yeah. I'm on it. I'm on it. <br/>Jeff: Nice job, Hero tribe. Nobody going home tonight. And a smaller but still useful fishing kit will be waiting for  you back at camp. Hustlers, you know the drill. Tribal council where somebody will be the second person voted  out of "Survivor." head back to camp, swim on out. <br/>In my mind, Simone is our least-valuable member. She doesn't fit in with all of us. We saw today she can't do puzzles. It's a bummer, by Simone's got to go. <br/>We played hard. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>I can just say, I’m really  sorry, like we had a lead and I wish I had been more dominant in the puzzle. We all wanted it so much, like it's the worst thing that could  have happened. And we're in the middle of connecting with everybody, bonding  with everybody, and to have to remove one of us, it just makes me feel sick. <br/>As far as challenges, it obviously stands out that I’m not  one of the strongest people here, so I think I would be an so what I need to  do is start shaping the narrative of the tribe. Clearly Patrick is getting on Lauren's nerves, and that's going  to play to my advantage. It is very easy for people to have opinions about Patrick, which  makes it very easy to shape the narrative around him. Honestly I don't want to out pat, but I notice you and Patrick  are butting heads. I know it sucks to talk about...  Patrick is earning my nerves. He's only energetic when it's something concerning him. <br/>I feel the same way. <br/>So you must worry about him. <br/>Right. We could probably convince maybe either Ryan or Devon to vote  with us. <br/>Patrick is unpredictable. I don't trust him, and he doesn't follow directions. So he could hurt us. You know, even though he's strong, strong isn't always what you  need. Simone's not that great at challenges, but Simone at least  listens. We got to get back over there so they don't trip out. So Patrick. <br/>All right. <br/>It's not going to be one of us. <br/>I hope not. <br/>It's not. It's Simone. <br/>Yeah. Exactly. <br/>Tonight at tribal council, Simone is going to be the one  going home. I have not seen her in any way helping us as a tribe. It seems like everybody else is on the same page with me. The boys are already together, and Ali's on my side, so I've got  a majority here. I think this tribe will be definitely better without Simone. <br/>Simone's the first one. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I hope that's all right. <br/>No, yeah. Of course. I'd rather be on the majority, right? <br/>Yeah. We're on the majority. <br/>Going into tonight, I definitely have options. You know, I know Simone will listen to me and I know she would  follow me, but me and pat have been together since day one. He looks at me and I can tell that he trusts me more than anyone  else in this game. <br/>I’m excited going for it. <br/>Me too. <br/>My only concern is people aren't sure about Patrick for  the long haul. I think everybody knows he's way too unpredictable. They never know what he's going to do. <br/>So gun to my head right now I'd probably say Simone. <br/>Yeah, but she said pat's name. <br/>Oh, my God. If we vote out pat, we'll probably lose every single time. <br/>Well, right now I feel like we have Simone eating out of  our hands. <br/>What are you thinking? <br/>Do we keep her around because she's someone that...  Right, right. <br/>Is easy to control? <br/>That's a very good point. Because pat is unpredictable. <br/>I know. So if we have the three, with me, you and Devon, we're golden. <br/>We could easily survive. If we have us three, that's all we need. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Because three is a majority. <br/>Initially I kind of wanted Simone out, but it's a lot of  uncertainty with Patrick. It's like you got a newborn baby, like you really want the like  it, take care of it, but it's really, really annoying because you have to  watch it every single second. He's really good around camp and he's great in challenge, as  well, but he's unpredictability, and predictability is the best thing I can  have in an alliance member. That's why I like Devon so much. <br/>As long as we get out of this hellhole, perfect. <br/>Yeah. <br/>But it's not like I’m dragging along a elementing in Simone. She scares me. She's really smart. <br/>We're good? <br/>We're good. <br/>For sure. <br/>I want to be Aligned with  predictable people who are socially good and want to listen to me. Tonight is about who can we trust more going forward, and who is  going to be the most loyal? It's really scary, but you got to put your trust in people in  this game because in a six-person tribe, there is no place to hide. <br/>Jeff: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead, grab a torch, approach a flame, dip it in and get  fire. This is part of the ritual of tribal council, because in this  game, fire represents your life. When your fire is gone, so are you. All right. Ryan, six days in, what's the vibe of the Hustler tribe? <br/>Obviously we're sad that we lost today. It was a tough challenge. But we've been in it a lot of the time, and we've bonded so well  together. I feel like it's a birthday party that your mom makes you go to,  and you don't like the kid whose birthday party it, is and we don't want to  go to it. We all love each other. <br/>Jeff: Oh, tribal is the birthday party for the kid you  don't like. <br/>But I want the keep everybody that's going to the party,  but I don't think that's going to happen. [laughter]  Jeff: Lauren, that's a really interesting observation. <br/>For me it's not a birthday party. It's more like a funeral. Hustlers usually work alone. We're the oddest group of people. I thought I was going to have a problem coming in and hanging out,  but we are capable of working together if there is enough communication, so I  hope it continues to work and I hope we don't get seen for a long time after  tonight. <br/>Jeff: Ali, I’m getting a sense from this group that  harmony is what's going to make you really gel. So does that make tonight's vote difficult? <br/>Yeah. Not only thinking as a tribe, but thinking personally, I have  the think, how is this person that either goes or stays going to benefit me  and my tribe. This game changes so rapidly, and you have to have people you  can trust and people that are on your side that you know you can go to them,  you know, when necessary. <br/>Jeff: Patrick, Ali makes a really good point. Every person you vote out impacts the tribe, but they also  impact your game. <br/>Yes, we've come to this sad birthday party, and it's  definitely impacting the way I want to vote and who I am going to vote out. I want to keep our tribe the strongest and keep our tribe moving  forward at its best pace. <br/>Jeff: Ryan, every vote matters, not only in harmony, but  also in terms of strategy. Because everybody here is already looking down the line. <br/>First of all there are a lot of facets. You can focus on physicality, short term win the challenges. You can say, we need to focus on social dynamics and try the  build trust into something strategic. There are sick different agendas up here, but everybody thinks  there is just one plan. <br/>Jeff: Simone, what will the vote be based on for you? <br/>If we were playing ole-school Survivor, it is always how  did the challenge go, but I think it has more to go with building up a body  of people you trust and understanding your relationship with them and  building a solid foundation so you can move together. <br/>Jeff: Ali, those are the kind of words said by somebody  that if they're true could be an alliance partner that goes deep. <br/>Yeah, I think so. I mean, once we vote, we're going to find out exactly where we  stand. So strategically someone like this that wants to stay tight is  going to be beneficial, of course. <br/>Jeff: Patrick, how important is trust to you right now in  this group? <br/>Having trust is huge. And I feel like I can trust most of the people here. <br/>Jeff: Most. He didn't say all. <br/>He did not. <br/>Sorry, Jeff, I meant to say all. <br/>Jeff: Wow. That got a big reaction, Patrick. <br/>It did. It was a slip of words. I'm talking too fast. They shouldn't have come out. I'm going to say I trust all of our members. <br/>I’m sold. <br/>Yeah, me too. <br/>That's it. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, while Patrick jokes, the truth is what comes  out out here is usually a lot more authentic. <br/>I agree with that. This is very real. I mean, if you mean all, say all. If you mean most, say most. This is a game. <br/>Jeff: Patrick, if I can put a heart monitor on you, how  many beats per minute right now? <br/>A lot. I would guess about 180. I think that's way faster than normal. Jeff, you know, I am nervous right now. It makes my stomach uncomfortable thinking that anybody could  want to vote home the only redhead on the time. <br/>Jeff: And yet, it's possible. <br/>Jeff, I would say I’m one of the most trustworthy people  you can know. The last thing I want is me going home. I want to be here on the last day with you. <br/>Jeff: How many of you were listening to that answer  thinking, oh, God, I hope it's not me tonight, because that's how I feel? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Everybody. <br/>Big time. <br/>Drew: Ryan, if it's you tonight, six day, is that enough? <br/>Everybody leaves so much here. I'd be gutted if I went home early, because your story is just  chopped, and you only have such a short time period to look back fondly upon  when you know that the game continued without you. <br/>Jeff: Simone, if it's you, not what you want? <br/>I agree. This is 100% real. This struggle is so different. I come from a city. I've never been camping before. I'm terrified 100% of the time. But the good thing about being a Hustler is you challenge  yourself. So send me back to the bugs. I don't want to go home. <br/>Jeff: All right. Time to vote. Simone, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote Patrick. Simone. Simone. Two votes Simone. Simone. Three votes Simone. One vote Patrick. Second person voted out of "Survivor," Simone. That's four, that's enough, you need to bring me your torch. <br/>Okay. I know. I know. <br/>Jeff: Simone, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Bye. <br/>Jeff: Well, the bad news is you lost a tribe member. The good news is, you're the Hustler tribe. When you get knocked down, you get back up. The game is early. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Captioned by media access group at wgbh
