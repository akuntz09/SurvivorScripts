<br/> <br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor:  <br/>I didn't trust you.  <br/>Probst: Lisa and Eliza clashed after Lisa switched  alliances.  <br/>Now, you can either take that or not, Eliza.  <br/>I'm furious. I'm gonna be civil to her, but if she were  gone tomorrow, I would be thrilled.  <br/>Probst: At Lopevi, John and Brady felt their days were  numbered.  <br/>I can't stand the way that this tribe ended up. Why are we  letting fat dudes run the show?  <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge, the memory skills of the  Yasur women won them Da, an island native for 24 hours. Da is a rock star  when it comes to living on the island. Back at camp, Da got right to  business, uncovering a bounty of food for the Yasur women.  <br/>Good stuff.  <br/>Oh...  <br/>Is it sweet?  <br/>Who knew we had all this food right in our backyard?  <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, the women worked well  under the guidance of Eliza.  <br/>Okay, yellow skull, brown skull. Switch it, switch it,  switch it!  <br/>Brown skull...  <br/>We got it.  <br/>Probst: But Rory failed to control his tribe.  <br/>Move that down...  <br/>Hey, switch like colors.  <br/>Guys, guys.  <br/>Probst: Guys need to work together, or you're never gonna  solve this.  <br/>I think we got it, Jeff.  <br/>Probst: Yasur wins immunity. [ cheering] After losing the  challenge for Lopevi, Rory knew he was in trouble.  <br/>I hope the five of us really are together, 'cause if  not...  <br/>Without a doubt.  <br/>...I'm dead right now.  <br/>Probst: And Sarge wavered with the older alliance, giving  John and Brady new hope.  <br/>If Brady, uh, gets voted out, I'm gonna lose a real good  work partner.  <br/>Sarge could, at the last second, make a change.  <br/>Probst: But at Tribal Council, Sarge held to his alliance,  and Brady was voted out. Brady, the tribe has spoken. 13 are left. Who will  be voted out tonight?

You didn't come here to be an individualist.  You came here to be a team.  <br/>But if you had the problem, Chad, why couldn't you be man  enough to come and tell me yourself?  <br/>It's not just me.  <br/>It wasn't just Chad.  <br/>Well, then why didn't you come to me personally? Why did  you have to go to him?  <br/>We talked about this before.  <br/>We-we talked about it. You said build a bridge and get  over it.  <br/>Everybody thinks that there's certain spots around the  fire that are better than others, and I don't think that's true.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>These two spots are the worst. That spot right... That  strip there for two is like... is like first class. Some positions are more  desirable than others, because the wind comes generally from one direction,  and it blows the smoke and sparks and ash over one edge of the fire. Bubba  just would not give up this prime spot.  <br/>Where you were last night, just move one spot over. It's  no big deal.  <br/>I won't even sleep around the fire.  <br/>Oh, Bubba, come on.  <br/>That's what everybody wants, bro.  <br/>Don't do that. Don't-don't do that, brother.  <br/>There's a lot of testosterone in the camp. It's the little  things that are getting on people's nerves. I'm kind of getting tired of  hanging out with these men. [ laughs] [ laughs] It's so lonely. It's so  lonely.  <br/>Oh, man, there's dudes down there in a canoe or  something.  <br/>It looks like they're coming this way.  <br/>It does.  <br/>If I knew we was gonna have visitors, I'd have baked a  cake.  <br/>When the two men arrived, immediately I was pretty excited  about it. I mean, it's the first visitor we've had, and we've not had a lot  of interaction with the nee lot of interaction with the nee Vanuatu. Vanuatu.  Vanuatu.

One chief.  <br/>One chief.  <br/>One chief.  <br/>One chief.  <br/>The guy came out and started talking to us in some  language that I have no idea. The one thing we could kind of pick out is that  he wanted us to establish a-a leader. [ speaking native language]  <br/>One chief...  <br/>Who's chief?  <br/>I guess he wants somebody to go with him.  <br/>Sarge, I think you're leaving.  <br/>One chief.  <br/>One chief.  <br/>They said, "Hey, Sarge, they're calling for  you." They said "You've got to go with them." I got ready to  go, and I took my long pants off and got my socks off and everything, got  ready to off and everything, got ready to go. go. Then all of a sudden, he  hands me a chief staff, and then he puts the chief, uh, emblem puts the  chief, uh, emblem around my neck. around my neck. Then he turns around and  gets in his boat, and we're, like, "I his boat, and we're, like, "I  guess I'm not going with him." guess I'm not going with him."  <br/>What the hell's going  <br/>What the hell's going on today? on today?

She's definitely our chief. She's the oldest. She's  the wisest. I think it was obvious for all of us.  <br/>That's it? Uh-oh.  <br/>Uh-oh.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Going bye-bye?  <br/>Have a good day. Thank you.  <br/>We're not really sure what this is all about, but we kind  of have a feeling that the tribes are going to get mixed up in some way, but  it could be anything. How do we know? We just have to wait and see. [ loud  rumbling]  <br/>Holy... Oh, my God. [ bats squeaking]  <br/>Whoa! Did you feel that earthquake? [ rumbling  continues]  <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [ loud, thunderous  rumbling] [ loud, thunderous rumbling] [ bats squeaking]  <br/>I have never... Whoa. Still going, bro.

Whew!  <br/>We don't have those in Colorado.  <br/>I have never felt like that in my life. Yeah, I felt the  ground opening. I'm telling you.  <br/>I mean, I'm like, dude. I mean, I heard about earthquakes,  but I never imagined the whole earth just frickin'...  <br/>It's still going. It's going.  <br/>I loved it.  <br/>Oh, I'm shaking like a... Look at my hand. [ laughs]  <br/>You rock 'n' roll, Mama.  <br/>Yeah. I'm happy. Whoo! I'm happy. Whoo!  <br/>I could do without that.  <br/>I could do without that.  <br/>Probst: Okay, before we get to business, did anybody feel  the earthquake?  <br/>Oh, yeah.  <br/>That was the wildest thing of the day.  <br/>Yes.  <br/>That was my cherry, Jeff.  <br/>Probst: Bubba, that was your first earthquake?  <br/>That was my first earthquake. At-at first, you could,  like, hear it before you hit, and, buddy, when it hit, man, them trees  started shaking, coconuts started falling. I mean, it was a sight. Oh, I was  excited.  <br/>Probst: Yasur, what was going on when it hit for you guys,  Lisa?  <br/>Oh.  <br/>I was, uh, chopping vegetables, and I'm not kidding, I  thought the ground was getting ready to split. It scared the daylights out of  me.  <br/>Probst: All right, well, let's get down to the business  about why chiefs were selected. about why chiefs were selected. Sarge, Scout,  over here. Sarge, Scout, over here. Everybody else, drop your buffs.  Everybody else, drop your buffs.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Probst: All right. Let me explain how it's gonna work. One  of you two is going to divide these two tribes into two new tribes, mixing up  the men and the women. Because there is one extra woman, one woman will not  be chosen. We'll deal with that later. Once the tribes have been divided, the  other leader will choose which tribe they want to take back with them to  their beach. To make things fair, we'll rock, paper, scissor to see who gets  to divide the tribes and who gets to choose.  <br/>One, two, three.  <br/>Probst: Paper covers rock. Sarge, do you want to divide,  or do you want to choose?  <br/>I'll choose.  <br/>Probst: It's on you. You're gonna divide these tribes.  Make sure you divide them as evenly as possible, alternating between men and  women to make sure it doesn't hurt you later when Sarge chooses which tribe  he wants.  <br/>Rory.  <br/>Probst: Now pick another guy to go to the other  tribe.  <br/>Chad.  <br/>Probst: Scout, pick one woman to join Rory.  <br/>Eliza.  <br/>Probst: Eliza joins Rory. Pick a woman to join Chad.  <br/>Jules.  <br/>Probst: Julie joins Chad. Pick another guy to join Rory  and Eliza.  <br/>Bubba.  <br/>Bubba.  <br/>Probst: Pick another guy to join Chad and Julie.  <br/>Chris.  <br/>Probst: Chris says hello to Chad. Scout, pick a woman to  join Eliza, Bubba and Rory. Eliza, Bubba and Rory.  <br/>Leann.  <br/>Leann.  <br/>Hello.  <br/>Probst: Pick a woman to join Julie, Chad and Chris.  <br/>Twila.  <br/>Probst: All right. John is the last man. Tell John where  he's going.  <br/>With, uh, Chad and Chris and Jules and Twila.  <br/>Probst: Now we're down to a really tough decision. Two  women left. One woman is going to join Bubba, Leann, Eliza and Rory. Which  one is it going to be?  <br/>Ami.  <br/>Probst: Okay. Scout has divided the tribes. Sarge, which  group do you want Sarge, which group do you want to take back with you to  Lopevi? to take back with you to Lopevi? Go join 'em. Scout, go join your new  Yasur tribe. Yasur, Yasur. Drop yours, Sarge. Everybody's getting a new buff.  Everybody's getting a new buff. It's a new Lopevi tribe. It's a new Lopevi  tribe. All right. Lisa, because you were not chosen...  <br/>I'm going bye-bye?  <br/>Probst: You get to choose.  <br/>Yes! Whoo-hoo-hoo!  <br/>Come on, try something easy.  <br/>Come on, Lisa.  <br/>Probst: Take your time.  <br/>We need you, Lis.  <br/>We want you, Lisa.  <br/>Lunch is ready when you get back.  <br/>We really want you, Lisa.  <br/>Yeah! Yeah! All right! [ Yasur cheering]  <br/>Oh, yeah! Yeah! Yes! Thank you so much!  <br/>Probst: Okay, let's get to your first challenge as new  tribes. It is for reward. Here's how it works. One tribe member at a time is  going to dive off the platform, swim out to a buoy, dive down, retrieve a  marker. There are 13 markers in total. Deepest marker is 30 feet down. The  deeper you go, the harder it gets. Bring it back to the platform and get it  up on the board. This is timed game. After ten minutes, whichever tribe has  the most wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for?  <br/>ALL: Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Been out here a while. Little bit of a shakeup.  Figured your taste buds could use...  <br/>Oh, Jeff...  <br/>Probst: Pringles and beer.  <br/>Oh, yeah!  <br/>Probst: Give you a little tease. You get one chip for the  tribe.  <br/>All right!  <br/>We only get one chip?  <br/>Probst: That's it.  <br/>Oh, Jeff.  <br/>Cheers.  <br/>Cheers.  <br/>Here we go.  <br/>Mm. Oh, my lord.  <br/>Probst: Okay. For the winning tribe, you will leave here.  You'll be taken to a waterfall. All the Pringles, all the beer you can put  down your gut.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Probst: Yasur, you have one extra member. You're sitting  somebody out. Who's sitting out?  <br/>Bubba.  <br/>Probst: Bubba's going to sit this one out. Everybody else  swim out, wait Everybody else swim out, wait for my go. for my go. Here we  go, for reward: a day at the waterfalls, Pringles and beer. Survivors ready?  Go!  <br/>Here we go.  <br/>Probst: Scout and Twila first out. out. Twila first down.  Twila first down.

[ all cheering]  <br/>Ow!  <br/>We got our new buffs, our new tribe mates. We got rid of  some people, and now, um, it seems like everybody's kind of happy.  <br/>Oh, man, this tastes good!  <br/>Ow!  <br/>And summer's great! Yeah, you got the summer.  <br/>Awesome! I can relate to this guy. I'm loving this. I've  got something to talk about. Yes! I love my other tribe. Am I going to miss  'em? Oh, hell, yes. But yet I fit in better with these guys up here. I'm  already kicking with these guys where I was never able to kick with the  girls. Do you take yours in comp when you get overtime?  <br/>Yeah, oh, yeah. I max out every year.  <br/>That is wild, dude! Another guy that works for highway  transportation. You know, this is just, you know... things are  clicking.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Doesn't this feel...?  <br/>Oh, yeah, the mist is  <br/>Oh, yeah, the mist is awesome. awesome.  <br/>I'm all buzzed up. I mean, not from the beer, but just  buzzed up from the change and, you know, the evolution and, you know, the  evolution here. here. I'm sure there's underlying things going on, you know.  I mean, two women, the rest of the men, so are they going to try to pick us  off? I don't know, so me and Twila are trying to weasel our way in are trying  to weasel our way in there pretty tight. there pretty tight.  <br/>As soon as the tribes started to swap, I was psyched,  because I knew that my odds in this game had drastically increased. I was  starting to get scared because the guys' alliance was really tight, and I  wasn't a member of it. But the bottom line is now that it's broken up, that's  all the work that I was trying to do is break it up. I'm just psyched. I  mean, our tribe's looking really good. Compared to the other tribe, I think  we really have an think we really have an advantage. advantage.  <br/>We had a tribe swap of sorts today.  <br/>Welcome to our shack.  <br/>We lost the reward challenge, which was disappointing,  but, you know, we don't even feel the loss right now, because everyone's kind  of excited that there are new faces around.  <br/>Vittles on.  <br/>Thanks.  <br/>Go ahead. Isn't too bad, huh, guys?  <br/>Thank you, ladies, so much.  <br/>Yeah, you're making us feel very welcome.  <br/>Well, you're part of our tribe now.  <br/>I thought it'd feel kind of strange, but this is all  right. That's the best meal I've had since I've been here. By far.  <br/>We have sugar cane, by the way.  <br/>Get out!  <br/>We've been chewing sticks of sugar.  <br/>I've been dying for sugared stuff. I think I'm really  going to enjoy living over here with the ladies, and stuff like that.  <br/>You're not going to swallow it.  <br/>You chew it. Chew it and spit it out.  <br/>Being in a tribe with a bunch of women, it does make you  nervous, because one wrong move, buddy, and they'll vote you out. Don't think  they won't. I guess you could say I'm sweating like a prostitute in church, I  guess you could say. [ laughing]  <br/>Wiggle, wiggle. There you go. You're the man. These guys  right now seem pretty willing to please. Right now they're just like whatever  it takes to get it done.  <br/>We going to show them how to do the coconut? Hey, did  y'all see how...?  <br/>Why?  <br/>Huh?  <br/>Why?  <br/>Why?  <br/>Why what?  <br/>Why what? We've been showing the guys all kinds of stuff,  and I said, "Oh, I'm going to show them how to crack the coconut."  Ami was, like, "Why?" Because to show them how to do it-- it's  cool. Well, why would you want to do that? You know, I'm like... why  not?  <br/>You want to teach them, teach them.  <br/>I think it's kind of cool.  <br/>I was so happy that Rory and Bubba started lifting stuff  and moving stuff and doing stuff. What I got irritated with was I saw a  little bit of our bond disappear. The girls were so excited to show them  everything. I just don't think it's really that important that we show them  all of our secrets. We're definitely still five women strong. That's not  going to change; at least on my end it's not going to change. I'm sticking by  the ladies. So, they really need to prove themselves. Otherwise, they're out  of here. Otherwise, they're out of here. There we go. There we go.  <br/>Probst: Okay, let's get to today's immunity challenge.  First things first. First things first. Scout. Scout.  <br/>Chris, think about the merge.  <br/>Probst: Immunity-- back up for grabs. Let me explain how  it's going to work. You're going to race into the jungle, collecting pieces  to build an outrigger canoe. Both tribes will start with your canoe on the  beach. Two tribe members will go into the jungle, untie the frame, bring it  back. The next two tribe members will go deeper into the jungle, untie two  paddles, bring them back. The last two tribe members will go even further  into the jungle, untie the outrigger, bring it back. Once you've gathered all  the pieces on the beach, you can begin to assemble the outrigger. Two tribe  members will then paddle out, retrieve the tribe flag, come back to the  beach. Your outrigger must hit the final marker pole on your way back. First  tribe with all six tribe members and their tribe flag on the mat wins  immunity. The losers-- Tribal Council, and this game will be over tonight for  somebody. Yasur, you have one extra tribe member, got to sit somebody out.  Bubba sat out yesterday. Who's sitting out today?  <br/>I'll sit out.  <br/>Probst: Scout, you're going to sit this one out. Everybody  else take your spots, wait for my go. Here we go, for immunity. Survivors  ready. Survivors ready. Go! Go! Sarge and Twila attacking the Sarge and Twila  attacking the knots. knots. Bubba with the first knot undone.  <br/>Pull, pull, pull it out. You got to start pulling the  other one.  <br/>Probst: One knot left in the center; Twila working on  that. Dead even. Lopevi has their frame.  <br/>Bring it down here, Sarge!  <br/>Probst: Yasur right behind. Bubba taking it all.  <br/>Pick it up.  <br/>Pick it up. Come on, go, go! Come on, go, go!  <br/>Hit the mat, hit the mat. Ami, you hit the mat, too.  <br/>Probst: Next two-- go, go, go!

Leann and Eliza right behind.  <br/>Come on, let's get those oars back!  <br/>Probst: Julie, almost there.  <br/>Got it.  <br/>Probst: Yasur, making up a lot of time. Leann has hers  free. She's helping Eliza. We're dead even. Chad and Julie are out. Leann and  Eliza right behind.  <br/>Come on, ladies, let's go!  <br/>Come on, Julie, come on!  <br/>Get ready.  <br/>Go, go, go.  <br/>Go, go, go.  <br/>Probst: Next two-- go!  <br/>Probst: Next two-- go! Leann and Eliza right behind.  Yasur's still in it. Yasur's still in it. Next two-- go! Next two-- go! Final  piece.  <br/>Come on, dude.  <br/>Probst: John working his knots. Rory right behind working  on his. John with a bit of a lead. Rory trying to make up some ground. Still  very tight. John getting very close. Rory falling a bit behind. Rory going to  have to make up a lot of ground for Yasur.  <br/>Do it.  <br/>Probst: John very close.  <br/>Lower it down, okay? As soon as my end touches the ground,  come on down.  <br/>Probst: Chris and John getting the outrigger portion.  Chris untying the last knot. John and Chris have the outrigger. They're  heading back to the beach.  <br/>Steady pace; I'm right behind you.  <br/>Probst: Yasur losing a lot of time.  <br/>Pace, pace, pace.  <br/>They are not even close.  <br/>Probst: Go, Rory, you're in this. Lopevi still needs to  assemble their canoe.  <br/>Hey, Chad, ready?  <br/>On the side.  <br/>Start assembling.  <br/>Over, in.  <br/>I got it.  <br/>Probst: Lopevi with a big lead. lead.  <br/>Come on, Rory!  <br/>Come on, Rory!  <br/>Come on, let's go.  <br/>Probst: Rory's dragging it. A lot of ground to make up.  Start assembling. Ooh, careful.  <br/>Watch out, watch out, watch out. Jeff: Both tribes working  on their outriggers. Lopevi with a big lead. Lisa working for Yasur, Bubba  working for Yasur, Yasur working very well together, making up some time.  Lopevi has theirs together.  <br/>Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Get in. Get in, Chad. We can't  go no farther.  <br/>Go; push the other way, Chad. I'll turn it, I'll turn it;  we're fine. Keep pushing, Chad.  <br/>Probst: Chad and John working together out to retrieve the  tribe flag. The big lead on Yasur.  <br/>You ready?  <br/>Probst: Get out there.  <br/>Let's go!  <br/>Probst: Yasur in the water.  <br/>Get in, Bubba.  <br/>Go. Head the right direction.  <br/>Probst: Yasur with a terrible push-off.  <br/>Oh, man.  <br/>Probst: They pushed their tribe completely the wrong  direction.  <br/>We're going backwards.  <br/>Probst: Panic by Yasur in a bad push-off.  <br/>Turn it around.  <br/>Probst: Let's go, Yasur. Pick it up.  <br/>We've got to go from that side, all right?  <br/>Straighten it out.  <br/>Don't worry, man, just paddle!  <br/>Probst: Lopevi's now all over the map.  <br/>Go, go!  <br/>Stroke, stroke.  <br/>Grab it, Chad! There you go. Yeah!  <br/>Probst: Lopevi has their tribe flag. tribe flag. Yasur's  closing the gap. Yasur's closing the gap.  <br/>Keep it going!  <br/>There you go.  <br/>Probst: Yasur with their tribe flag.  <br/>Come on!  <br/>Probst: They're around the buoy and heading back.  <br/>Row!  <br/>Probst: Going to be a race to the finish.  <br/>Paddle the other side, bro. When you paddle that way, it  turns, man.  <br/>Probst: Lopevi heading the wrong way.  <br/>Oh, whoa.  <br/>Probst: Yasur's still in this.  <br/>Chad, use the bottom to turn, use the bottom to  turn!  <br/>Probst: Lopevi's got to hit  <br/>Probst: Lopevi's got to hit their flag. their flag. their  flag.  <br/>Get out, get out, get out!  <br/>Get out, get out, get out!  <br/>Probst: Lopevi wins immunity!  <br/>Probst: Lopevi wins immunity! [ cheering] [ cheering]  Lopevi-- congratulations. Nobody going home tonight.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah. Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Yasur, not sure what went on out there. Rory, you  lost a lot of time on the knots. Some of the worst paddling I've ever seen.  Somebody's going to pay for it tonight. See you at Tribal Council. See you at  Tribal Council. Head back to camp. Head back to camp.  <br/>Tribal Council is coming up and Bubba and I are both...  it's very, very apparent that one of the two of us has got to go. I feel the  women of Yasur are going to vote as a solid block. I feel extremely  vulnerable. The only thing I can do is assume the worst and hope for the best  and pray to God that I'm here tomorrow.  <br/>What did we look like out there? Did we look like total  idiots, or what? I'm annoyed as hell with Bubba right now. The second that we  arrived at our challenge, I see Bubba making signals to Chris. He was  communicating completely, and Chris was nodding like, "Yep, that's  right. Yep, that's right." Bubba was not helping me one bit.  <br/>No.  <br/>During the entire time, I...  <br/>Was he trying to tell...  <br/>Yes. I saw him talking to Chris. I just watched it happen  the whole time. It was disgusting. People will... people will get themselves  kicked out. You don't have kick them out. They'll get themselves kicked out.  I don't know exactly how the other girls are voting, but I definitely have my  vote. Bubba is not part of the tribe. He's making plans with the other team.  That's... Can you see Michael Jordan whispering over to the other team what  their next play is? Hell, no. He is not on our team. He's out. I'm done with  him.  <br/>What do you guys want to eat?  <br/>When we got to the immunity challenge and I saw my old  tribe mates, out of a-a desperate chance, trying to communicate with Chris, I  was trying to mouth "merge" for him to think of the merge. Because  if, uh, they win all these immunity challenges, the women are going to have  the advantage during the merge, and they're going to pick the guys off one by  one. But, who knows, I may have got caught with my hands in the cookie  jar.  <br/>Losing sure does take it out of you.  <br/>It took the wind out of my sails. If y'all choose me, will  you tell me before I go?  <br/>I don't know. You have to ask the boss.  <br/>I just said, "If you choose... could you tell me  could you tell me before I go?" before I go?"  <br/>Ask everybody, you'll find... everyone knows.  <br/>I didn't... I didn't say that. I just said if y'all choose  I'd like to know before I go. I just don't want to get blindsided, you know  what I'm saying? You know, that's all I ask. I wasn't asking for you to vote  either way. I just would like to know. I just would like to know.  <br/>Yeah, no, I hear you.  <br/>Yeah, no, I hear you.  <br/>Ami noticed Bubba making, uh, hand signals and working  with the other team trying to signal them something, so, how do you feel  about that, little one?  <br/>I'm worried that we're shooting ourselves in the foot, you  know.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I just think it's going to be... I just think it's going  to get harder. I don't know.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>It's definitely dangerous to vote the guys off. These  challenges are going to be physical and we are going to need their strength.  I don't want to vote off Bubba or Rory. We like them both a lot. I think we  could... potentially, like, we're already down four guys to two. Now we're  going to be down to just one guy on our team and then we're going to have  really physical challenges and... What?  <br/>We're not going to kick  <br/>We're not going to kick one of us off. one of us  off.  <br/>Thank you, Lord, for everything that you've done for us.  Thank you for all the opportunities that you've given us and thank you for  the beautiful days on Vanuatu. Thank you, Lord, thank you. Amen. You know I  love you, brother. You know I love you, brother.  <br/>I love you, too, bro.  <br/>I love you, too, bro.  <br/>Probst: Welcome to Tribal Council. Let's go back to when  we switched. Lisa, after being women and men this long, is this truly one new  tribe now?  <br/>Well, we've tried to make them as welcome in the tribe,  and we actually have enjoyed having two men around. Feels like they have been  with us forever, and I've personally enjoyed it a lot.  <br/>Probst: Leann, what's the reaction on a split? Is it,  "All right, this is the tribe I'm on now and who knows what's coming  next?"  <br/>I think it's really difficult after 11 days of bonding  with all these women, and I'm not going to lie, I haven't made the  switch.  <br/>Probst: So it's still men versus women for you?  <br/>Yes, it is.  <br/>Probst: Ami, are they equal members, even though there are  five women and two men?  <br/>This morning I thought we were one team. I was excited  about the challenge. I was ready to go, and I see Bubba making signals to  Chris, and the second I saw that signal, I'm like, we're not a team; this is  not a team here. That... I-I saw it happen.  <br/>Probst: So, Bubba, at today's immunity challenge, you  tried to get a signal or you gave a signal?  <br/>I was trying to get a signal to let me know if they were  going to play it to win or they were going to strategize trying to get more  men into the merge.  <br/>Probst: What were you hoping to get back?  <br/>Just a... a thumbs up or a smile or a wave-- something. I  took a chance. It was a big gamble.  <br/>We had all intentions on winning.  <br/>And you weren't going to be the one that we had picked, if  we did lose, to go.  <br/>Probst: Rory, a little worried on your end, then?  <br/>The fact of the matter is, Jeff, the only thing that could  have changed our fate is for Yasur to have won immunity today. That's the  only thing that was going to stop one of us two from leaving tonight.  <br/>Probst: Ami, is it a little difficult for you to know  you're going to sacrifice both these guys when they really didn't do anything  other than end up on the wrong end of the buff?  <br/>Yeah, it's a little difficult for me, but I'm glad-- sorry  to say this, guys-- but I'm glad that we have them and it's not Twila or  Jules that are going home tonight.  <br/>Probst: Bubba, so why should they keep you?  <br/>Because I-I busted my butt trying to win. I almost drowned  when I was a kid in the ocean. I never set foot in the ocean till I got here.  Six weeks I came here, I learned how to swim. So you know me getting my butt  in that boat was making a big step, so I am a team player. It's just, I made  a mistake. If you need to win challenges and stuff, you know beyond a shadow  of a doubt, I'm going to bust my butt to do it.  <br/>Probst: Rory, why Bubba and not you?  <br/>These women know where my heart is, and they know that if  anybody is capable of being 110% part of this team, it's me. I go down with  my ship, and if I can't break into that union of women, of the sisters, then  I'm going to take my lumps. I'm man enough to do that.  <br/>I just wanted to say when I... initially divided up the  teams, there were three guys that I really wanted to play the game with, and  these are two of them, and, uh, the game ain't over till the fat lady  sings.  <br/>Probst: It is time to vote.  <br/>Probst: It is time to vote. Leann, you're up. Leann,  you're up.  <br/>Bubba, you know you're my brother. We were just put in an  awkward situation where it was going to situation where it was going to be  you or I. be you or I.  <br/>Rory, I picked you,  <br/>Rory, I picked you, and, uh, go get him, girls. and, uh,  go get him, girls.  <br/>Sorry, Bubba, you know  <br/>Sorry, Bubba, you know why. why.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are  read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the  Tribal Council area immediately. Council area immediately. I'll read the  votes. I'll read the votes. First vote... First vote... Travis-- Bubba.  Travis-- Bubba. Rory. Rory. One vote Bubba, one vote Rory. One vote Bubba,  one vote Rory. Bubba. Bubba. That's two Bubba. That's two Bubba. Bubba.  That's three votes Bubba. The sixth person voted out of Survivor: Vanuatu...  Bubba. That's four votes. That's enough. That's enough. You need to bring me  your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Bubba, the tribe has spoken.  It's time for you to go. It's time for you to go.  <br/>Peace out, y'all.  <br/>Peace out, y'all.  <br/>Probst: Well, Yasur is now down to six members, same  number as Lopevi. The question is, will the women stay united? Will there be  a merge? A lot of questions, a lot of game left. Grab your torches, head back  to camp.

Next  time on Survivor:  <br/>I will not...  <br/>Probst: Rory makes a daring move.  <br/>...continue to slave around camp if I do not have a shot  at making it through Tribal Council. My speech was so cheesy, I couldn't even  believe I was saying it.  <br/>Probst: And the clothes come off at Lopevi.  <br/>I think the coed thing is working really well for our is  working really well for our tribe now. tribe now.  <br/>I had a great time playing. Got in trouble throwing a  little signal. I think the Yankees are going to give me a job to work first  base so I can send some signals. It really shocked me how close you can  become with a person when you're with them that long. And one thing I  learned, the important thing is what you have important thing is what you  have in life and that's my family.
