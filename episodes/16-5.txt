<br/>Â Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor... Favorites win  reward! ...the favorites continued to dominate the game, winning their third  challenge in a row.  <br/>We've got an unbelievable bounty over here.  <br/>Probst: Ozzy found the hidden immunity idol on Exile  Island.  <br/>I found the idol!  <br/>Probst: And he replaced it with a fake one as a  decoy.  <br/>Do your job now, buddy.  <br/>Probst: At Airai, Chet's laziness dragged down the  tribe.  <br/>I don't feel like Chet really wants to carry his weight.  Dude, like, either pick it up or go home.  <br/>Probst: And after another Malakal victory in the immunity  challenge... Favorites win immunity! ...Chet was Airai's obvious  target.  <br/>My mind is just spinning, just the fact that he's still  here. Chet is not in this game right now. He's a physical and mental  liability, and he's horrible for morale around camp.  <br/>Probst: But in order to save her alliance, Tracy  challenged Joel...  <br/>Why you letting him call the shots right now?  <br/>Am I letting him? I don't know.  <br/>Yeah, you're freaking just following like...  <br/>No, I think...  <br/>Like a herd of cattle down the road.  <br/>Probst: ...and turned his attention toward Mikey B.  <br/>Mike's going to take you down the next chance he gets  because of what you did to Mary.  <br/>I think he will, absolutely.  <br/>Okay, so this is his next chance.  <br/>Probst: At tribal council, Jason made a plea to keep the  tribe strong and get rid of Chet.  <br/>We have lost four of six challenges. Just take a moment to  really think about who we keep on the island and who we let go.  <br/>Probst: In the end... Mike. ...Mikey B. was blindsided,  and Joel got rid of his biggest rival. Mike, the tribe has spoken. Time for  you to go. 16 are left. 16 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will  be voted out tonight?  <br/>Good night.  <br/>Tonight, walking into tribal council, I was hoping that  our tribe would make the right decision to vote out Chet, the weakest member  of our tribe. But unfortunately, that didn't But unfortunately, that didn't  happen. happen. I'm definitely bummed that Mikey's gone. We need a physically  strong tribe. I have a bad feeling that we're just going to keep losing and  losing and losing, and I feel that the tribe I'm in is not the tribe I want  to be in.  <br/>Another one bites the dust, and it wasn't us.  <br/>Three outcasts prevailing.  <br/>Three outcasts prevailing.  <br/>Just for now.  <br/>Just for now.

But  you know, we're ready. We're hungry.  <br/>I'm worried more about my fingers getting chopped  off.  <br/>Yeah, just don't chop hand.  <br/>Yeah, I'll hold it. You chop.  <br/>I guess Ozzy's going to kill the chicken. Ah! I mean, it's  no... I work in surgery, so it's not a big deal to me. But I just don't want  to see a dead, bloody chicken flapping everywhere.  <br/>Just lay him down like this.  <br/>Good night, baby.  <br/>Good night, buddy. Good night. Sleep good.  <br/>One, two, three.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Ah, he's bloody!  <br/>Oh, Charlie!  <br/>I know.  <br/>Oh, Charlie. Let's go get some wood to cook him.  <br/>We're having chicken tonight.  <br/>After the challenge, I went to Exile Island, and I found  the hidden immunity idol. It's awesome. So after we killed the chicken, I was  slick enough that I was able to hide the immunity idol before anyone could  suspect otherwise. At this point, I don't think I'm going to show anyone the  idol, going to show anyone the idol, but I totally trust James. but I totally  trust James. And I think I can trust Amanda. And I know I can trust Parvati.  Don't tell anyone, but I told James I found the idol.  <br/>You did?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Oh, my God! Ozzy told me he had the immunity idol, and he  told me, James, and Parv.  <br/>No.  <br/>Okay, good.  <br/>So it's in our little four clique, and I think it's going  to stay in our little four clique. So we're like the powerhouse So we're like  the powerhouse right now. right now. right now.  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Favorites getting your first  look at the new fan tribe. Mikey B. voted out at the last tribal council.  Figure after 12 days of competing against each other, it's time you got to  know each other. Drop your buffs. We are switching tribes.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Oh, my goodness.  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>Probst: There are seven white stones and one colored  stone. One is purple, one is orange. For this tribe, if you grab purple, you  will be a captain. Please don't look. Fans, one orange stone. If you grab  orange, you're the captain. Don't look. All right, everybody put your palms  up. Three, two, one, reveal. Natalie, Ozzy, two captains. Take your spot over  here. Ozzy is the captain for the new Malakal, Natalie the captain for the  new Airai tribe. You can choose a man or a woman, but you must choose  somebody from the opposite tribe. So you are choosing a favorite.  <br/>James.  <br/>Probst: James joins Natalie, the first choice in the  schoolyard pick. Say hello to your new tribe mate.  <br/>Hey, baby.  <br/>Probst: Ozzy, your choice. You're choosing a fan.  <br/>Troy.  <br/>Probst: Who?  <br/>Troy-- Joel  <br/>Joel.  <br/>Probst: Joel.  <br/>Joel.

One of two choices.  <br/>All right, Cirie.  <br/>Sorry, girl.  <br/>That's okay. I'm good.  <br/>Probst: Kathy, it is your choice. It's been made for  you.  <br/>Eliza.  <br/>Probst: Eliza...  <br/>Yay, guys.  <br/>Probst: ...joins the new Airai Tribe. Chet grabs his stuff  and joins the new Malakal Tribe.  <br/>Chety's here. Chety's here.  <br/>Probst: Malakal, here are your buffs. Airai, here are your  buffs. Put them on. Suit up.  <br/>Oh, yeah!  <br/>Probst: We are no longer tribes of fans versus favorites.  We are now Malakal versus Airai. You guys ready to get to your first  challenge as new tribes?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: All right, for today's challenge, both tribes will  divide into pairs. Those pairs will be harnessed together. Each round,  starting at opposite ends of the course, a pair from one tribe will chase a  pair from the other tribe, attempting to grab a flag off their back. Each  time you get a flag, you score a point for your tribe. If you don't grab a  flag within one minute, the other tribe scores a point. So it's even chances  of scoring for both tribes. First tribe to score three points wins reward.  Want to know what you're playing for?  <br/>Yes!  <br/>Tell me it's food.  <br/>What is it?  <br/>Probst: It's a little "get to know you" home  barbecue.  <br/>Yes! Oh, my God!  <br/>Probst: Steak, sausage, some veggies, some spices, and  wine.  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>Probst: And because we want you guys to have a little time  to get to know each other, no Exile Island today.  <br/>Oh, nice.  <br/>Probst: Worth playing for?  <br/>Yes!  <br/>Yeah, yeah!  <br/>Probst: I'll give you a minute to figure out your pairs.  We'll get started. All right, Malakal won the rock, paper, scissor. You've  decided to be the chasers. In the first round, Erik and Ozzy will be chasing  after Kathy and Natalie. Survivors ready? Go!  <br/>Go get them.  <br/>Probst: Ozzy and Erik cutting right through the middle of  the course. Natalie and Kathy got to get a move on it.  <br/>You got it, you got it.  <br/>Probst: Ozzy making ground. Ozzy grabs Kathy's flag!  Malakal leads one-zip.  <br/>Beautiful.  <br/>Probst: Now we're going to alternate. This time Airai will  be doing the chasing. Parvati and Eliza will be chasing Chet and Joel.  Survivors ready? Go! Eliza and Parvati, Eliza and Parvati have them cornered.  Joel and Chet escape. The race is on. You have one minute to catch him, or  Joel and Chet will score for their tribe.  <br/>Go, go, go, go!  <br/>Probst: Eliza getting very close, dragging Parvati behind  her. 30 seconds left. Eliza grabs the flag from Chet. Parvati and Eliza score  the first point for Airai! first point for Airai! You all right? You all  right?  <br/>Probst: Next round, it will be Ami and Amanda chasing  James and Jason. Tied 1-1, playing to three. Survivors ready? Go! Ami and  Amanda trying to catch James and Jason. They got one minute to do it. Ami  hops over, just misses a shot at Jason.  <br/>Hold them up, guys. Hold them up.  <br/>Probst: Ami's hurt, still hanging in there.  <br/>Go, go!  <br/>Get him!  <br/>Probst: Oh, Jason tied up! Ami has a shot at it! Trying to  get it! Ami has Jason's flag! Malakal leads 2-1. Here we go, next round.  Jonathan Penner and Alexis chasing after Cirie and Tracy. Malakal leads 2-1.  If Cirie and Tracy can avoid being caught, Malakal wins reward. Survivors  ready? Go! Penner and Alexis out of the gate quickly. They have one minute to  catch Tracy and Cirie. Otherwise, Malakal wins reward. Penner dragging  Alexis. Cirie and Tracy doing a good job, staying away. Cirie dragging  Tracy.  <br/>Go, go, go!  <br/>Probst: 30 seconds left. Penner reaches for the flag,  can't get it! Alexis grabs the flag off Cirie. We are tied 2-2. Our injury  tally so far-- Penner has a busted up knee, Parvati has a busted up lip, Ami  has a tweaked knee. Next round, Airai is putting up Parvati and Eliza.  Malakal is putting up Chet and Joel. We're tied 2-2. We're playing to three.  Chet and Joel must catch Parvati and Eliza to win reward. Otherwise, Airai  wins reward. Here we go. Survivors ready?  <br/>You got them.  <br/>Probst: Go! Parvati and Eliza just have to avoid Joel and  Chet for 60 seconds, and they'll have steaks, sausage, wine and  fixings.  <br/>Go through, Chet. Follow them.  <br/>Probst: Joel and Chet have got to catch Parvati and Eliza  in order to win this game. Joel's got them cornered, just misses the flag.  Parvati and Eliza are alive. Joel trying to drag Chet, takes a hard  fall!  <br/>Come on, Chet!  <br/>Probst: Keep moving! 30 seconds!  <br/>Come on!  <br/>Probst: Joel getting frustrated. Parvati and Eliza have 15  more seconds to avoid being caught...  <br/>Get up, let's go!  <br/>Probst: ...for a big barbecue reward! Ten, nine, eight,  seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Joel and Chet cannot catch Parvati  and Eliza! Parvati and Eliza! Airai wins reward! Airai wins reward!  <br/>Probst: All right, Airai wins the first challenge as new  tribes. Nice work. [ applause] Big reward-- steak, veggies, some wine to  celebrate.  <br/>Woo-hoo!  <br/>Probst: Malakal, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff.  Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Head back to camp.  <br/>We've got a... back there, there's a giant cave. I'll show  you guys that.  <br/>Oh, cool. Even more than what we have.  <br/>And then we have the chickens.  <br/>I'm not good about losing. I know that's where my temper  gets to me. And I'm still decompressing. Maybe this is poetic justice in some  form, because I chose to get rid of Mikey versus Chet. And now here I end up  with Chet again on my tribe, who's probably the weakest of both the  tribes.  <br/>Erik, are you coming?  <br/>You know, there is a little bit of irony in that. But at  the same time, it can be good to have people around that ultimately will be  expendable.  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>When it rains, this is the place to be.  <br/>Yeah, it's all dry here.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Oh, this is wonderful.  <br/>It's ridiculously dry here. I am so excited to be on this  tribe right now. I like these people on this tribe. I mean, I got to meet  Ozzy today! At this point, the game has changed completely. Now, rather than  being with the fans, I'm with some of the favorites. But I'm going to try and  not let that cloud my judgment. They're still people in this game.  <br/>And then we use half of it as a blanket. We sleep on this  half, and then we pull that up.  <br/>You don't understand. We had nothing, so...  <br/>That's why, like, you know, it really sucks to lose the  challenge today, but it's one meal. It's one nice meal. But you know, we're  going to be eating. I feel like we do have an advantage because we're on the  Malakal beach, and we have all of the things that you need to be a strong  tribe.  <br/>Thank God I can hug you now.  <br/>It's just a question of are we going to be a strong tribe?  Chet, man, he's like a sack of potatoes. In the challenge, he freaking gave  up. Like, he just... he was, like, being dragged. He wouldn't even stand up.  I just don't see him being a strong competitor at all. I don't know what's  going on with that dude, but he needs to go. go.  <br/>Lift up.  <br/>Lift up. I've always liked chickens. I've raised chickens  all my life, so I pretty much know everything about chickens. They're very,  you know, peaceful animals. They're very placid. But, you know, they have  their own pecking order-- literally, a pecking order-- where the weakest one  is always basically pecked on until they're killed-- the same as pretty much  in this game of Survivor. The weaker one is usually pecked on until they're  removed from on until they're removed from the tribe. the tribe.  <br/>Then this is where our fire is. So... and then we made,  like, a little...  <br/>So this is the shelter?  <br/>This was Chet, mine, and Tracy's. We build... we had to  build this one. This slept us three, and those slept seven.  <br/>So you guys sleep on the beach with these things jumping  all over you?  <br/>Yeah, it's pretty gross.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>The Airai camp is pretty much a disaster. The beach is not  as good as our beach. Kathy, move that up a little, because the tide is  starting to come up behind you. Even though winning the food reward of steaks  and spices and wine was great, at Malakal, we had everything. And here, we  pretty much have nothing. It's definitely a downgrade in terms of camp  life.  <br/>I'm so happy. It's nice to have things kind of shaken up.  So it's good to get to know more people.  <br/>Whoa! Not good.  <br/>Can it get up that high that it's going to put our fire  out?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>The water hasn't come into your shelter, has it?  <br/>Not yet.  <br/>Oh, just to hear that sizzling sound is great!  <br/>So good right now!  <br/>Oh, my gosh. Here comes the water.  <br/>Ah!  <br/>No. No, it did not.  <br/>No, it didn't. It did? No.  <br/>The old Airai, the setup that they were living in was  terrible. The waters are washing away the fire, you know. I'm amazed that  they're still alive, poor things. They should be dead. I mean, they're a  bunch of dingbats. More wood, huh?  <br/>It went really deep.  <br/>Yeah. Oh.  <br/>Well, my knee's a little screwy. I was on the course in the  challenge, punctured it somehow. There was some sharp something, went right  into my muscle. A lot of people got fat lips and twisted knees and stuff like  that, and I found a stick, and it went straight into my leg. I'm gimping  around like I'm Quasimoto. It's painfully sore. I really tweaked the hell out  of I really tweaked the hell out of it. it. Oh. It's not too late to suture,  right? It's all right? And... and... argh! And... and... argh! Ah! Ah!  <br/>A little one again.  <br/>Ow! Damn it! Ah. Ah. It hurts! It hurts!  <br/>Ow! God! It's crazy! I'm in the middle of the freaking  jungle. A wonderful doctor came out to the beach and cleaned my wound and  stitched it up, and they left me with three stitches and a painful leg.  <br/>He's going to live.  <br/>Are you all right then?  <br/>Oh, I'm fine. There could be an infection, and it could  work down towards the joint of my knee. So let's hope it doesn't get So let's  hope it doesn't get worse. worse.  <br/>Ozzy is amazing. The kid can swim like crazy. He's natural  in the water. That's just... that's just how he was born, and there's nothing  to it other than that. I mean, I can't compete with him. He's amazing.  <br/>We are in a really good position over here, because I  think we have a really strong tribe, aside from maybe one person.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>What are you thinking?  <br/>You're obviously thinking something.  <br/>I'm just thinking Chet, and then after that, between Tracy  and Cirie, which, I mean, I don't know.  <br/>I'll tell you what. If you're willing to get rid of Cirie  first, I got no problem giving up Chet and then being back to 3-3, calling  that fair.  <br/>After we were out on the water, we had a little  conversation on the beach between mainly Joel and Ozzy, and I kind of  listened in. And it was kind of like two superpowers kind of discussing  terms.  <br/>You know, being completely legitimate, our concern is that  there's four from the favorites and four from the fans, and the first one to  go down to three is kind of...  <br/>Screwed.  <br/>You know, unless something changes.  <br/>Well, if we can trust each other...  <br/>Unless there's some level of trust somewhere. I think it  is, to a degree, still fans versus favorites, but either the favorites have  to swing a fan over to their side, or the fans have to swing a favorite over  to their side. Somebody's going to have to Somebody's going to have to flip.  flip.  <br/>So if we build our day camp at the other end of the beach,  we can build a camp for all eight of us to sleep together.  <br/>Let's do it!  <br/>When we woke up this morning, it was the first priority to  find a new location for the new shelter.  <br/>Is this too far?  <br/>No. I mean, I'd say this is the best place to build  something.  <br/>Yeah, I think is...  <br/>To have four new people with so much experience under  their belt, being able to point at this and say, "We need to do this,  and we need to do this, and this is how we did this," I mean, it's  unbelievable.  <br/>We need two posts.  <br/>We need two posts. We'll have the front this way. We'll  have the front this way.  <br/>With our new tribe, this got erected in an hour. The new  members of Airai, I mean, they're just on it. They're quick. They're making  it happen. It's getting done. And it's brilliant.  <br/>It's so refreshing to have new people here. I know you all  are sad to miss your cave and all that, but I can't tell you how nice it is  for us. for us.  <br/>Yeah, I understand that.  <br/>Yeah, I understand that.  <br/>What'd you get?  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>What is it?  <br/>A huge shark.  <br/>Shark!  <br/>Ozzy!  <br/>Ozzy!  <br/>A big shark dead in the net?  <br/>Yeah. That's why we have to keep the net clean, because  the sharks...  <br/>Ozzy!  <br/>It's huge, huh?  <br/>When I went over to the net, I looked down, and there was  this huge white thing. And I'm like, "Oh, my God."  <br/>That's, like, 40 pounds maybe.  <br/>40 pounds?  <br/>Yeah, 35, 40 pounds.  <br/>It was huge. What am I going to do? I'm from Montana. We  don't have sharks in Montana.  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>Isn't that freaky?  <br/>I mean, damn, Amanda, she basically wrestled a four-foot  shark by herself. I mean, that's pretty attractive to a guy like me.  <br/>It's so juicy.  <br/>It's so juicy. Oh, my God!  <br/>I'll take this over beefsteak any time. Best eating in  over 13 days.  <br/>If it makes you guys feel better, it's the best eating for  us, too.  <br/>That does make me feel better.  <br/>That was an amazing meal. Now we just want to kick ass. We  just want to start winning. We just want to start winning.  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: First things first. Ami, take back immunity. Once  again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, four members  from each tribe will alternate throwing rocks at ceramic tiles. Each time you  break a tile, you release a bundle of wooden puzzle pieces. Once you've  collected all four bundles, three tribe members will assemble the puzzle with  the help from a caller on top of a tower. The edges of each puzzle piece must  match the color of the piece next to it, which means black must line up with  black, purple with purple, orange with orange. If it doesn't line up, you  don't have it right. First tribe to solve the puzzle correctly wins immunity;  losers, tribal council, somebody going home. Give you a minute to strategize,  and we'll get started. Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready? Go!  <br/>Come on, guys.  <br/>Come on, James.  <br/>Probst: Throwing rocks to break tiles.  <br/>Come on, Ozzy.  <br/>Probst: Ozzy connects and breaks the first tile for  Malakal.  <br/>Almost, almost.  <br/>Come on, Tracy!  <br/>Come on, Tracy.  <br/>You got it.  <br/>Take your time.  <br/>Nice!  <br/>Probst: Tracy breaks a tile for Malakal. for Malakal.  Penner breaks a tile for Airai. Penner breaks a tile for Airai. James smashes  a tile but not enough.  <br/>Oh, that sucks! Come on!  <br/>Probst: You have to obliterate that tile to get the rope  to drop. Erik breaks a third tile for Malakal.  <br/>Keep going, keep going. Quickly, guys, quickly.  <br/>Probst: Malakal only has one tile left to break.  <br/>Pick it up. Let's pick it up. Yes!  <br/>Probst: James breaks another tile, but it doesn't drop.  Got to smash all the way through. Jason breaks a tile for Airai.  <br/>Come on, smash those, smash those, quickly, guys,  quickly.  <br/>Probst: Erik drops the fourth tile for Malakal.  <br/>Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.  <br/>Bull! We say bull, bull, bull!  <br/>Probst: Penner, you got the same tiles, the same  ropes.  <br/>They've got a knot we've got to untie. Here, let me untie  it.  <br/>Purple and then pink.  <br/>Right there, it's right there. Put that one in  there.  <br/>I mean, my ass!  <br/>What?  <br/>Probst: Airai, you need to stop bitching and start  throwing.  <br/>Just hitting them as hard as we can, Jeff.  <br/>There you go. Okay, there, there.  <br/>Probst: Malakal working on their puzzle already.  <br/>Like that, like that, like that.  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: Airai drops their third tile. One left. Jason gets  it down! Airai collecting their puzzle pieces.  <br/>Pull them, pull them! Quick, quick, quick! They're not  close. We can get this.  <br/>That's not it.  <br/>Something's wrong here.  <br/>That's not it. That's not it.  <br/>White, white. Just look at it.  <br/>Probst: All colors much match up along the frame and with  other pieces of tile.  <br/>That piece is wrong right here.  <br/>No, no, it's pink right here, pink right here.  <br/>We got to get the corner pieces. We need a yellow with an  orange on that one.  <br/>Probst: Eliza calling the shots for Airai.  <br/>The other way. The white has to touch the white. Yeah,  bottom.  <br/>Probst: Chet calling the shots for Malakal.  <br/>That white right there shouldn't just, like, end that  way.  <br/>I think that one has to be the corner. Take that one and  put it here, Parv.  <br/>Probst: Airai made up a lot of time. We are dead even  right now.  <br/>That piece is wrong. These black ones need to go to that  corner.  <br/>That piece isn't going to fit in there.  <br/>No, it will. Keep that white one there.  <br/>Probst: Joel getting very involved in this puzzle.  <br/>You know what, Eliza? See if you can see the big picture.  There's got to be a bigger pattern to it.  <br/>It's a black and white zigzag-- black on this side, white  on this side.  <br/>Parv, give her the one in your hand. Yeah, put that  there.  <br/>Yes, now you're on to something.  <br/>Probst: Airai thinks they're getting closer.  <br/>This piece here has to come out. Yes, take that out.  <br/>No, that one's right, Cirie.  <br/>Okay, I think we got it.  <br/>There we go. That's it.  <br/>We're done.  <br/>Oh, my god, we got it. We got it, we got it, we got it!  Oh, my God.  <br/>Probst: Airai wins immunity! [ cheering]  <br/>Comeback, baby!  <br/>Probst: Airai, immunity. [ applause] Nobody going home.  Malakal, tribal council tonight. One of you will be voted out. You have the  afternoon to figure out who it's going to be. I'll see you at tribal. Grab  your stuff. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Head back to camp.  <br/>We lost the challenge, and for me, this is what, five, six  losses in a row? I mean, I stopped counting.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>At this point, I don't know if it can be a fans versus  favorites anymore, unless we want to really just keep losing. So...  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I could care less about how the numbers dwindle  away.  <br/>I really could care less as well. I think Chet's our  priority.  <br/>Just doing the right thing, and the right thing is to get  rid of the weak. This game is a game for strong people, and we need to keep  it that way. I don't think I've ever, in my life, interacted with somebody  that is so just spineless.  <br/>Clean your coop out later.  <br/>It's almost like he's a wet rag or a ball of goo. There's  absolutely zero honor whatsoever in keeping somebody like that on our team. I  mean, if you went back to medieval times, I think we'd kill him ourselves.  You can only ever play the hand you're dealt, right, Oz?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Play it to the best of your ability and get rid of the  cards that aren't working for you, and I think we got a couple cards that  aren't working for us. that aren't working for us.  <br/>What do you think?  <br/>What do you think?  <br/>Yeah?  <br/>Yeah?  <br/>That's my thought.  <br/>That's my thought.  <br/>I know.  <br/>You want a drink of this?  <br/>You want a drink of this?  <br/>Yeah, I do.  <br/>Yeah, I do.  <br/>I think we should make our team the strongest.  <br/>I think so, too. I definitely think so.  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Erik seems to think that we should get rid of the weaker  players in the tribe, which would be fine with me, except I'm included in the  weaker tribe members.  <br/>We lost that challenge today because of him.  <br/>See, I can't see...  <br/>I could see it, and you girls were right. He could have  moved on, but he was like, "Get it out of there! Get it out of  there!" Get it out of there!" Joel, it was his fault today. Joel,  it was his fault today.  <br/>Chet is viewed as one of the weaker players, but at the  same time, Joel didn't help his own team win, and he didn't help us team win,  and he didn't help us win today. win today.  <br/>Right now, I have to convince Ozzy and Amanda that Joel is  a bigger threat for us than Chet bigger threat for us than Chet is. is.  <br/>...then we'll have Joel. We'll still have the numbers.  We'll be able to win reward. We'll be able to decide who to We'll be able to  decide who to send to Exile. send to Exile.  <br/>You think Joel is really that great helping us win? He didn't  help us win today. He didn't hit one tile. Big as he is...  <br/>That's true.  <br/>...he should have hit something. Tracy is, like, this big  and hit more tiles than he did.  <br/>I know.  <br/>He didn't do nothing but screw us up in the puzzle.  <br/>Like, I mean, he's still, like, a mover and a shaker.  Chet's nothing and a nothing.  <br/>But Joel is already playing the game. Chet ain't really  into playing the game like that. There are so many pluses for getting rid of  Joel, and Chet is just like a pawn. We can use Chet for whatever we need  whenever we need.  <br/>That's true.  <br/>Joel you can't do that with.  <br/>That makes sense. This is an incredibly important vote  tonight. We are at a crossroads. We are at a point where we need to decide  how we're going to approach the rest of the game. Chet, in challenges, he is  a waste of space. On the other hand, Joel wants to win challenges, but Joel  wants to win the game really bad, and Joel is dangerous. Joel is dangerous.  It's a hard decision. It's a hard decision.  <br/>Probst: So let's talk about the switch. Ozzy, you and  Natalie were selected as captains. Natalie had the first choice, immediately  took James. You countered with Joel. Was that to match up size for  size?  <br/>Yeah. It just seemed like the logical choice at the time  to try and match James's strength with Joel's.  <br/>Probst: On the flip side, Chet, you really weren't even  picked. You were left over and ended up on this tribe. Does that work on your  psyche at all about where you fit in this game?  <br/>Um, you know, I felt like I was in trouble from day one in  this game, but I'm still sitting here. And of course, it's not the greatest  to be picked last, but that was the group of people I wanted to end up with,  whether they chose me or whether I went there by default, so I was very happy  with the results, no matter what.  <br/>Probst: Tracy, let's talk about the challenge where you  were dragging each other through the mud. It was your first time together as  a new group. What do you think?  <br/>I think that watching Joel and Chet, if there had just  been a smidgen of communication for the guy he was dragging around behind  him, then we almost would have had it. If somebody with you can't walk or  gets their head whopped against a board and they can't see, putting your feet  down and pulling like a Clydesdale, you know, is just not going to get it  done.  <br/>Probst: Joel, obviously, Tracy's talking about you and the  way you were dragging Chet around like he was a bundle of bananas.  <br/>Yeah. What do you want me to say? There was communication.  If I was going under, I said, "Under." If I was going through, I said,  "Through." Don't shake your head. If I was going over, I said,  "Over." If he couldn't hear me because there was mud in his ears  from being dragged through it, it's not my fault.  <br/>Probst: Chet, what was your experience being the one  behind, being dragged?  <br/>First off, I felt like I was harnessed to a Mack truck and  drug through the forest. And when somebody is making up their mind in a split  second, you do end up getting smashed into posts. And there wasn't as much  communication in the last aspect of that challenge for us as there was in the  beginning for us.  <br/>Probst: Erik, tonight's vote, is this about keeping a  tribe strong so we can win in challenges, or is it four fans, four favorites,  somebody's going to win out?  <br/>When you bring the two groups together, there is that  initial thought, the fans versus the favorites still. But at this point, I  think most of us are looking at this as we just need to stay strong.  <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to vote. to vote. Erik,  you're up. Erik, you're up.  <br/>I'm voting for Chet tonight. We want to stay strong as a  We want to stay strong as a tribe, and take it easy. tribe, and take it  easy.  <br/>This is because you called me  <br/>This is because you called me weak one too many times.  weak one too many times.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes.

Certainly caught Joel by surprise. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good  night.
