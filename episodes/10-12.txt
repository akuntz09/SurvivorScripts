<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously ON on Survivor:  What the hell was that? <br/>Probst: After Janu shocked her tribe by quitting the game,  Koror's plan to oust Stephenie was out in the open. <br/>STEPHENIE: I don't know who to trust. I don't know who to talk to. I almost don't want to talk to anybody. <br/>Probst: But Stephenie's presence in the game put the men  on edge. <br/>Stephenie progressing in this game means that Koror falls  apart. <br/>Probst: Tom was also feeling vulnerable. <br/>I'm pleading for my life. My strength in the challenges, it's part of what got us to this  point. <br/>Probst: But the women saw an opportunity and a plan was  hatched. <br/>I think it's an awesome idea. <br/>Who would be the first one you'd want off? <br/>You want to think I'm a threat? I'll show you how threatening I am. <br/>Probst: Before the immunity challenge, Tom turned to  Caryn. <br/>I think that we do have some kind of a sympathetic thing  going where we're going to look out for each other. It was a good move on my part to be friends with Caryn. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, the pressure was on. There are five tiles for each of you. First person to break all five of their tiles wins immunity. But Ian was handed victory when Tom took out his last tile. Ian wins immunity. <br/>Thank you, guys. <br/>Probst: Back at camp, Katie approached Caryn about the  women's alliance. Stick with the women and take out the men? <br/>Probst: Caryn leaked the information. <br/>What do the girls think? <br/>Trying to figure out which side to take out. <br/>Probst: So Ian confronted Katie when he learned of her  plan. <br/>Caryn is spreading that you're trying to get all the girls  against the guys. <br/>I just hate for it to be such a sweep and Tom just takes  the whole thing and none of us have a chance. <br/>Probst: All hope for the women's alliance was crushed...  It's already been too much of the Stephenie show. Stephenie needs to go. Too much of the Stephenie show. Stephenie needs to go. <br/>Probst: But Steph still clung to hope. <br/>I've said my piece, I planted my seed. If they're smart, Tom will be the next one to go. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, although Caryn received one  vote, Koror stuck together. The third member of our jury, Steph. And Stephenie, the only remaining Ulong member, was finally  voted out. The tribe has spoken. Six are left. Who will be voted out tonight? (theme song playing) * (man groaning)  Poor girl. Did you see her face? She was probably stressing out. <br/>It was horrible. I know. <br/>I felt bad. <br/>Stephenie was the one voted off. I thought that it could have been me last night. I wouldn't blame them. If I was playing against me, I'd want me out of here, too, but  they didn't do it; it was a relief. They're holding true to the five, and would I like to believe  that it will continue to do that. <br/>Everything's good; everything's good. <br/>I'm going to tell you I've been trying to think of  different things. I'm up all night running scenarios. <br/>Me, too. <br/>Caryn and I spoke on the way to tree mail. She's more nervous than a longtailed cat in a roomful of rocking  chairs, at this point. She knows that she's outside of an alliance of five, so she  feels she's next. I can't step out from five to side with one right now. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>And what you've got to do is pull your own savior; your  salvation. <br/>I've been telling Tom and Ian that Gregg and Jenn need to  be split, and he said he knew that, but that he could not turn against the  five people that he had the alliance with, so... I am definitely the most  vulnerable of the six remaining, no question about it. I'm just hoping and praying that something happens. Otherwise, I'm going home. <br/>Scamper, scamper, scamper. We got tree mail. <br/>We're up, we're up, we're up. <br/>"Care for a bit of R&amp;R? To be pampered would be nice."  ALL: Oh! "To get the VIP treatment, some island knowledge is the  price."  "You'll soon know who your friends are. In love and war, all is fair."  "But there can only be one winner, the one who keeps  their name up in the air."  Oh, man. <br/>It sounds like, uh... What we've been waiting for, Jenn. <br/>I know. <br/>Everybody wants this. <br/>Katie and I promised each other, if we won a challenge,  we'd take each other if we have the ability, and that's what we're gonna  today do. <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, God. I'm fighting hard for this one. <br/>Me, too. <br/>Probst: Come on in! We are down to six. For today's reward challenge, I'm going to ask you a series of  questions about Palau and Micronesia. Every time you answer a question correctly, you earn the right  to drop another tribe member's torch closer to the water. After three drops on any one tribe member's flame, that flame  goes in the water; they're out of the challenge. Last person left standing, wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes. (horn blowing)  Look at that. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Double-decker. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>For your reward, you will board a luxury yacht, you'll get  a fresh shower, then you will feast. You'll spend the night on the yacht. You will return to your beach tomorrow-- hopefully rejuvenated,  re-energized, to get you through these last few days. Make sense? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Take a spot. Let's go. All right, pick up the cubes; we'll get started. First question: "Palau is famous for its green,  "mushroom-shaped islands "known as: A) Stone islands, B) Rock  islands, or C) Mushroom islands." Correct answer is: "B) Rock  islands." Everybody got it right. Tom, you're up first. <br/>Oh, no. I didn't want to be first to start this nastiness. <br/>Probst: Gregg takes the first hit. <br/>We'll even it out. (chuckles)  Probst: Jenn, you're up. Who is Jenn going to hit? Caryn takes her first hit. Ian. (laughs) (weak laugh)  Whoa. &gt; Probst: Caryn takes her second hit. Every reward we get, Caryn gets all the food. Caryn, you get to pay somebody back right now. Heading over to Katie. Katie takes her first hit. Gregg. <br/>Tom. <br/>Probst: A little payback? <br/>Little payback, that's it. <br/>I would expect no less. <br/>Probst: Tom takes his first hit. Katie. <br/>I'm out. <br/>Surprise, surprise, surprise. You also got a cheeseburger, Caryn. <br/>Probst: Wow. Just like that. <br/>Let's try to still be nice. &gt; Probst: Caryn's out in the first round and not happy. Next question: "In the early days of Palau, stone was used  as a form of money. The largest stone weighed up to: "A) Five pounds; "B)  Ten pounds, C) 100 pounds, or D) 10,000 pounds." Correct answer is:  "D) 10,000 pounds."  Damn. <br/>"Five tons." Tom is the only one who got it  right. Make your move. <br/>Keep with an all-boy theme on this one, and, uh...  No, don't do that. <br/>I'm sorry, my friend. <br/>Probst: Ian takes his first hit, courtesy of Tom. Next question: "The islands of Palau are encompassed in the  north Pacific Ocean and which other body of water? "A) The Indonesian Delta, "B) The Bay of Guam, or C)  The Philippine Sea." Correct answer is: "C) Philippine Sea."  Everybody has it right. Everybody gets a shot. Tom, you're up. <br/>Just to level the playing field. <br/>Probst: Jenn takes her first hit. Chance for payback to Tom. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Not even thinking twice. Tom, one hit away from being out. Ian could put Tom out of this challenge right now. <br/>And that's what I'm gonna do. <br/>Sorry, buddy. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Tom takes a big dip and a seat on the bench. He's out of the challenge. Everybody left in is even at this point. Gregg, lots of choices. <br/>It's an easy one. Sorry, "E."  Probst: Ian takes his second hit. One hit away from being out of the competition. <br/>This is tough. <br/>Probst: Katie could put Ian on the bench right here. <br/>Don't let it come back to haunt you. <br/>He's out and can't vote for you if you get him. <br/>I'm getting you next. <br/>Good point, good point. <br/>Just so you know. <br/>Would you hate me? <br/>Would you hate me? <br/>Yes. <br/>Katie, no way. <br/>Sorry. <br/>You got to spare yourself. <br/>You've got to spare yourself. <br/>It's true. <br/>Come over here, buddy. <br/>Probst: Ian is shocked, and Ian is out of challenge. <br/>I'm sorry, Ian. <br/>Shot to the heart. <br/>Oh. <br/>Probst: Next question-- "Palau lies in which  direction relative to the equator?" "A) north, "B) south, C)  east or D) west"? The correct answer is... A) north. Jenn has it wrong. Gregg, Katie have it right. Seven degrees north of the equator. <br/>That's why it's so damn hot. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>Probst: Gregg, your shot. <br/>Come on, not me. <br/>Probst: Your choices are Jenn, Katie. <br/>Damn! <br/>I didn't take you out. I could have, but I didn't. <br/>Yeah. <br/>That was a deal made, right? <br/>It sounded like it. I heard a promise. <br/>Is that horrible if I hit you, Jenn? You'll never live it down, ever. <br/>Probst: Wait, Gregg. <br/>Yeah. Did you just ask permission? <br/>Yes, he did. <br/>Wow. <br/>Is it okay, dear? <br/>What a...  Gregg, be a man. <br/>Don't do it, Gregg. <br/>I can't believe you're doing that. <br/>You said, "I'll save you."  If you hit me, she's going to hit me, too, I'll be out. <br/>Probst: Wow. <br/>You suck, Gregg. <br/>Probst: Gregg hits Katie. Katie comes back and hits Gregg, and no smile on that face. Interesting how that works. Jenn is now in the lead. Gregg and Katie down to their last drop. Jenn still has two hits. True or false... "Palau was the first nation in the world  to issue the Elvis Presley postage stamp." Correct answer is true. Gregg got it right, Jenn got it right. Katie got it wrong. Jenn, you're up. <br/>Sorry, Katie. <br/>Don't. <br/>I'm sorry. <br/>Probst: Katie is out of the competition, takes a seat on  the bench. Gregg's only choice is Jenn. <br/>At least he didn't ask. <br/>Probst: You both have one hit left. One person gets it right, and the other person gets it wrong,  that's it. "The coconut crabs which inhabit the islands of Palau have  the special ability to do what after they eat? "A) change color; B) leap up to three feet; or C) replicate  themselves?" For reward, make your choice. Jenn says B. <br/>That is wrong. <br/>Damn. <br/>Probst: Gregg says "A) change That is right. Gregg, make your final hit. Gregg has no choice. <br/>Oh, damn. <br/>Sorry, Jenn. <br/>Probst: Takes Jenn, puts her out of the challenge. Gregg wins reward. <br/>Sorry. <br/>Good job, Gregg. <br/>Probst: Yacht, shower...  Sorry. <br/>Probst: ...massage, big feast. Obviously it wouldn't be much fun alone. <br/>Oh! So pick one person to join you. <br/>Sorry, guys. Jenn, let's go. <br/>Oh! Thank you. <br/>Ooh...  Probst: I'm sure you guys will have a good time together. And two is very fun, but three is a party. Pick one more person. <br/>Oh, God! <br/>Oh! <br/>Sorry, man. <br/>Katie. (cheering)  You are forgiven. <br/>Hey, guys, I'm so sorry. I will, uh... I will pay you back. <br/>Oh, no, we'll pay you back. (laughing)  Probst: Tom, Ian, Caryn, head on back to camp. All right, guys, your yacht is waiting. Have a good night. That's the icing on the cake. We didn't come here for the icing. We came for the cake. Let's go talk. I have an idea. <br/>You do? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm serious about it, yeah. <br/>Today at the challenge, Katie chose to throw me into the  water rather than Gregg, and I said, "Wow, that's interesting. If Katie is willing to sell me out for a night on the yacht,  there's no way she's going to hold on to me for a million dollars." We  have a couple choices to make. <br/>Okay, go. <br/>The way that I see it right now, we have lost control of  the game. <br/>Why? <br/>We're not making the decisions. Gregg and Jenn are. <br/>Why, 'cause they won one challenge? <br/>No, uh-uh. I think that they got Katie, and one of the three of us out. Me, Tom, you. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I think it goes in that order. I know they're ready to turn on you. I know for a fact. <br/>And you think Katie is in with that? <br/>Yeah, I think she is. <br/>Caryn warned me that Katie was looking to get rid of me,  but I still wasn't willing to take her word over Katie's at that point. Now, Ian says Katie, she's now become the shady lady Katie,  looking to dump us and go into the final with Gregg and Jenn. <br/>I think Gregg is a dark horse right now. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Nobody would vote against him in the final two. <br/>Nobody. Especially...  Why? <br/>He's never made any enemies. <br/>He hasn't pissed anybody off, he's very affable. He works hard. <br/>What do you think? <br/>We go for Gregg tomorrow night. <br/>Do we? <br/>We'd tie, wouldn't we? <br/>Yeah. Three would go against me, and three would go against Gregg. What more do you propose? <br/>I don't know what the next step is. <br/>Suddenly, the sequence of events have fallen into place  that have really benefited me. Those five had an alliance, and, lucky for me, that alliance is  breaking down now. I'm not sure exactly what's going to happen. The only thing I can do is to keep close to Tom and Ian. That's all I can do. That's my only hope. <br/>Gregg, you got to go on first. <br/>This is awesome. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>We get to the boat and Captain Mike greets us and lets us  know this is a day of being pampered, VIP treatment. <br/>Rooms one and two. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>He shows us to the bunks and when we walked in we found  our bathing suits which we haven't seen since we left for the island. (shouting) We were so excited to get on to the next event. So we quickly scrubbed up, threw the bathrobe on and then we  went up to the deck for full-body massages. It felt like finally I was on vacation in Palau. (whispers indistinctly) That feels great. This is unbelievable. I'm sitting there loving it, just relaxing, and then I noticed  the hands feel a little colder, feel a little different. Next thing I know I get a hard smack on the ass, and I do a  double take. My eyes have been closed, I've been daydreaming. And my best friend from home, Greg, is staring at me, and he's  like what's up? <br/>Looking fine, dude. <br/>Doing well, man. <br/>Yeah, hell, yeah. <br/>We were both in disbelief. <br/>It was nuts. We didn't know how to react. <br/>Cheers. <br/>I don't even know where to begin. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Oh, my God, what's this? What?! Oh, my God. <br/>Shrimp and...  What is this? <br/>Dig in, man. <br/>This is an onion ring. <br/>This is beautiful. <br/>Calamari. <br/>This is, by far, the best reward challenge, I mean,  obviously. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>You got... you got all the stuff? <br/>All of a sudden, I get a tap on my shoulder, and it's my  sister Kim. All I could do was bawl, like cry. That's all I could do. I was just like, oh, my God. She's here! <br/>We're going to have a party! <br/>Stan is my sister's husband. He is the brother I never had. My sister just had a baby, so she wasn't able to come, so it was  the next-best thing to having my sister. I couldn't ask for a better reward. <br/>It was the most phenomenal experience of my lifetime. <br/>Now they're doing it. <br/>But you're sure that she's ready to go against me with  them? <br/>Yep. <br/>Mm-hmm, I know that. <br/>So Gregg should go tomorrow? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>It would be very easy in a tie situation. You put Gregg and Caryn up against the wall. <br/>And so we need to break this tie. <br/>Katie is forced to switch her vote, because she knows that  if she doesn't, she has to pick a rock. <br/>Right. <br/>The way the rules are, if there is a tie at Tribal  Council, both members who were voted on, those two will become safe and it  comes down to the rest of us, reaching in a bag, pulling out a colored stone. Whoever gets the purple stone is going home that night. That's a calculated risk on our part. <br/>Maybe she picks the rock and then we have to pick a rock  to see who goes home. It sucks, but I can go to Tribal Council willing to take the  rock, you know what I mean? Like, I'm willing to make that gamble. I came to play a game. <br/>That's the plan. <br/>You and I are both willing to choose rocks. <br/>And we should be. <br/>That's right. Let's do this. <br/>Desperate times call for desperate measures, right? <br/>We have a plan. <br/>Tom and I have decided that we're going to force a tie at  Tribal Council. We've prepared ourselves for the idea that we might be going  home, but this is a risk we had to take. <br/>It's a gamble. Hopefully, Katie realizes that she doesn't want to pick a rock. She wants to stay in the game. This is the biggest step that you and I have to get to the final  three. That's why it's important that he does not see it coming. Any leaks and we're done. The game's over for us. It's a delicate operation that needs to be handled with the  utmost of care. It's kind of like taking a bag of potato chips from a fat man. You can do it, but you'd better do it quick. Otherwise, he'll turn around and sit on you. <br/>You've been acting the last two days like you're about to  be sent home. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Continue to act that way. <br/>Okay. <br/>Do not say a word... &gt; Don't be chipper. Be down and dour. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay? <br/>Yep. I can do it. I'm psyched. I'm totally psyched. This is really working out well. I think we can pull this off, I really do. Because you know what? I'm a very good actress, very, very good. <br/>This is so gorgeous. We're on a boat going to this lagoon. We're just thinking snorkeling, we have no idea. <br/>I don't know. <br/>Oh, my gosh, there's dolphins! <br/>All of a sudden, all of us see these fins that are just  swimming through the water and we're like oh, my God, no way, no way! <br/>Hi. <br/>Hi. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Swimming with the dolphins was, by far, the most magical  moment I've ever had. It was something I've always wanted to do. I mean, it's like my dream. <br/>Hi! <br/>Oh, this is...  Oh! <br/>I'm so happy. <br/>It was the most surreal experience I've ever had, and to  be able to share that with my sister was just incredible. I kept going, "I can't believe you're here for this."  It's just the experience of a lifetime, and she got to share it with me. I never wanted it to end. It was unbelievable. <br/>Cheers. I can't reach. <br/>After the day of snorkeling, and hanging with the  dolphins, we were able to do a little strategy talk. This was our opportunity to confirm that, hey, guys, it's us  three to the final three. We happen to have a good bond, and it just also benefits the  three of us to go to the final three. <br/>I came into this knowing that I might have to jump ship,  if it comes down to it. My strategy is to stick with those people that make the  decisions until those people no longer have any power, and then jump to the  next person that makes the decision. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We all realize the threats that Ian and Tom are, so it was  good to get agreement with that. It felt real. It felt true. And I believe that that bond is-is tight till the end. <br/>I hear a boat. <br/>I think it's them. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Here we go, guys. <br/>Let's do this right. <br/>I'm sour and dour. <br/>Hey, hey! <br/>What's happening? <br/>Who's that? <br/>I don't know. <br/>That's their families. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>Those are your families. Today I think my worst fears were, uh... realized. Only three family members got to spend time with their loved  ones, and the other three are left on the beach to, uh, hear the stories. <br/>How you doing? I'm Tom. <br/>This one cuts and twists, and, uh, it's tough. <br/>We're almost there. <br/>I know. <br/>We'll plow through. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Get-Get this thing done. <br/>It'll get tough, you know, when you guys get down to  picking people that you care about off. <br/>Sure. <br/>Well, if there's one person that, uh...  You've got somebody looking out for her out here, it's me  looking out for her, so...  Good. I appreciate that. <br/>When my friend Greg had to leave, it was just really  tough. <br/>Remember, we're all proud of you at home. <br/>You know, it was only a year ago that my dad passed away,  and the grieving still happens every day. Just tell my mom that I love her so much and I cannot wait to  just spend time with her when I get back. Will you tell her that? <br/>I will. <br/>Just tell her...  This might have been the last love fest in camp. <br/>Let's do a really cheesy... (indistinct voices)  Now it's time to get control of the game again, and focus  on the coming six days and what needs to be accomplished. It has been a good run, but it's about to get a little rough. That little trip that they took may cost them big. <br/>Tree mail. <br/>What have we got? <br/>"Some played hard, some just watched and others just  skated by. To make your chances one in five, give this one your best try. "Usually this is a second chance, but for some it's all  brand new. So embrace the challenges of the past, or tonight you could be through."  What? <br/>Wow. <br/>In order for our plan to work, a lot has to happen today. Worst case scenario is Gregg wins immunity, so we really need to  work hard today and make sure that doesn't happen. I didn't come to play for sixth or fifth or fourth or third or  second. I'm going to do my damndest to make sure that I come across the  finish line first. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! How's it going, everybody? <br/>Hey, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: First things first, Ian... give it up. Immunity once again back up for grabs. It is rare in this game of Survivo that you get a second chance. Today's challenge provides just that-- a second chance to  revisit some of the challenges from the past. It is a Survivor elimination-style challenge. All six of you will race up the net maze. The first five to finish will move on to the next round, where you  will race to a symbol-- a land version of the sea star puzzle. The first four to finish that will move on to the next round,  where you will eat three balut, a partially-developed duck egg. The first three to get the balut down the quickest move on to the  next round, where you will race to untie a box, retrieve a flag, string it up  the flag pole. The first two to finish that move on to the last round. The last two Survivors will compete in a head-to-head shooting  competition. The first Survivor to knock out their three targets wins  immunity. Take your spots, get started. All right, for immunity, first five to finish move on to the  next round. Survivors, ready. Go! Tom and Ian and Gregg up first. Tom and Gregg neck and neck. Ian right behind. Jenn in it. Tom is across. Gregg's down, moving on. Ian's moving on. Jenn's moving on to the next round. Down to Katie and Caryn. Katie moves on to the next round. Caryn, you're out. Have a seat on the stump. Moving on to the next round. This is what you're trying to solve. First four to finish their sea star puzzle move on to the next  round. Survivors, ready. Go. Everybody making some good progress. Gregg has the bottom row. Ian has the bottom two rows. Gregg getting closer. Uh, Jeff, I think I'm done. Ian has it. Take a spot on the mat. Tom has it. He's moving on. Take a spot on the mat with Ian. Tom and Ian moving on. Looking for two more to join them. <br/>Okay. There we go. <br/>Probst: Gregg has it. He's moving on to the next round. It's down to Jenn and Katie-- one person moving on, one person  sitting down. <br/>Wait, I got it. <br/>Probst: Jenn has it. Jenn moving on. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Katie, you're out. Take a seat with Caryn. <br/>Damn it! <br/>Jenn, Gregg, Ian, Tom, moving on. Reveal the balut. The first three people to get their balut down the quickest move  on to the next round. Survivors, ready. Go. Ian shoving them in as fast as he can. Jenn staying with the guys. Ian has all three in his mouth. Tom has all three in his mouth. Gregg and Jenn bringing up the rear. Tom's good, and moving on. Ian's good, and moving on. It's down to Jenn and Gregg. First one to finish moves on. Jenn puts the third balut in her mouth. Gregg has all three in his mouth. Jenn very close. Jenn moving on to the next round. Gregg is out. First two to untie their box, get the flag out, clip it in and  string their flag up to the top of the pole move on to the final round. Survivors, ready. Go. Ian using his mouth. Jenn making quick work of the knots. Ian and Tom very tight. Got to get your flag out and up the flag pole. Keep moving, Jenn. You're falling behind. Ian has his flag. Tom has his flag. Tom's clipped in. Tom to the top, moving on. Ian moving on. <br/>Damn it. &gt; Probst: Jenn is out. Join the others. All right, moving on to the last round. Ian, you're up first. First person to knock out three targets wins immunity. <br/>I'll go with blue. <br/>Probst: Ian takes his aim. Ian connects with his first target. He's up one-oh. Tom looking to even the score. Tom misses. Ian leads one-oh. Ian looking to extend the lead. And he does. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: Ian drills his second target. Tom needs to get on the board. Tom nicks it, doesn't break it. Tom, still not on the board. All Ian has to do is knock out his last blue target. And he does. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: Ian wins immunity. <br/>Nice job. Good shooting. <br/>Probst: Ian, get over here. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Nicely done. <br/>Thanks. &gt; Probst: Back-to-back challenges, safe tonight at Tribal  Council. Tom, Jenn, Gregg, Katie, Caryn, not the same for you. One of you is going home tonight. Should be a fun afternoon back at camp. I'll see you at Tribal Council tonight. Head on back. <br/>I remember the jungle course being a lot easier on day  three. (Jenn laughing)  Ian won immunity for tonight. That darn gun, man, that is my Achilles heel. It's very fortunate I became a fireman rather than a cop,  because it would just be dangerous for everybody. Well, that's okay. 'Cause you know what? I was going five, you were going four, so rightfully so, I  should be the one taking the risk. We've got a plan in place. Ian and I are gonna pretend that there's nothing going on,  everything is fine. But the three of us-- myself, Ian and Caryn-- will vote for  Gregg tonight, the other three will vote for Caryn, and then we'll go to a  draw and be forced to pick a stone. But it won't be Ian who has to choose-- he won immunity. It'll be me. So I'm very vulnerable, but it's better to play it hard and go  home tonight than to sit around here and just wait to be eliminated by their  threesome. <br/>So, we're good with the immunity today. We needed Caryn not to get it. <br/>Yeah. We should all be pretty proud of the fact we looked around and  said, "Hey, five of us."  Right. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We're there. I was a little nervous stepping away from the game for a while,  so it was comforting to come back and get no mysterious looks or no... people  trying to connive. So, I can say with a lot of confidence that Caryn will be going  home tonight. I mean, you could tell, she's just out of commission today. <br/>Caryn's in a Janu place, huh? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Well, that's what happens when you know you're done. <br/>Caryn is winning an Academy Award right now. She is lying in the hut, down and sour, like she thinks she's  going home. Perfect. Just the way we told her to. So, this should be a total surprise tonight. <br/>I think so. <br/>Interesting or...  No. Just it's gonna be...  It's always interesting. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'll start getting some firewood. <br/>All right. <br/>I just feel so rejuvenated. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We have a good advantage. The next one, though, is the big one. <br/>It's big, yeah. <br/>Yeah. Oh, exactly. <br/>Things going okay? <br/>Yeah. Yeah. <br/>Good. Good. <br/>I was just thinking today a lot about family, and I just  wanted to talk to you about it. I told Stan right before he left, uh, I was gonna watch over  you. <br/>Aw...  And that I was gonna protect you. <br/>That's still the deal for me. <br/>Good. <br/>There's only two people in this game that I've made  promises to; Tom's one, Katie's the other-- I told Katie I wouldn't write her  name down, and I told her brother-in-law I had her back, and that means a lot  to me, so... I'm gonna stay true to that. What I wanted to talk to you about was, we're gonna flip it  tonight. <br/>Yeah. <br/>What do you mean? <br/>Um, Caryn and Tom, um, and I are gonna vote for Gregg. <br/>Yeah. <br/>What?! <br/>Yeah, we're flipping the game around. We're gonna force a tie, unless you vote Gregg. <br/>If it's a tie, then what happens? <br/>It goes to rocks. You know, that's why I wanted to give you the heads-up. <br/>Ian pulled me aside, like, right before we went to Tribal  Council with the idea of taking out Gregg. I had some issues with it. I'm, like, you know it's really unfair for you just to come in  and say, this is what we're doing, this is what the plan is. Think about it-- for you and Tom, that's great. But I'm just thinking as far as I'm concerned, I was in a good  place. <br/>I know that you're playing the game, and I know that you  don't want to take me to the finals because you're afraid...  'Cause I wouldn't win, Ian. <br/>Katie, if you and I go up against each other, it's gonna  be a lot closer than you think. <br/>That's such crap. <br/>He's, like, "Do I have a reason to feel  paranoid?" I'm, like, I don't think so. <br/>No. I mean, that goes without saying, right? <br/>I just don't want you to get dumped. I'd rather see you in the final two with me. <br/>Right. The reason Ian wants me with him in the end is so he'll win. Tom wants the same thing. <br/>I'm ready to go. <br/>When it comes down to it, I'm gonna have to make a  decision so I can have a better chance of winning. I'm here to win a million dollars just like anyone else. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of the jury. Coby, Janu... and Steph, voted out at the last Tribal Council. Let's talk about the reward challenge. This late in the game, they can be good news/bad news. You don't want to be away from camp and miss the politics. On the other hand, if you don't win, you might miss out on  something fantastic, like a surprise visit from the loved ones. Gregg, did it turn out to be a good thing? <br/>Yeah, it turned out to be a great experience. But on the other side of the coin, it-it did hurt to know that I  was leaving behind three tribe members, and they didn't get to share in the  opportunity, so, you know, it's a tough situation to be in. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about the reward challenge itself. It is designed to bring out the status of a tribe. Caryn, you were first out. Yeah, that was very hard. <br/>For some reason, they felt I had too many rewards. And I didn't feel I had won that much, but, you know, there was  obviously some resentment about that, 'cause my torch went out like that. <br/>Probst: Do you think that's all it was, you had a little  more food, nothing else? <br/>I do think so. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: How can it not have more implications than just  food when you watch Gregg ask Jenn for permission about what to do? (laughter) You guys are laughing; I'm serious. We're down to the nitty-gritty here for a million bucks. Jenn, you're clearly seen as somewhat of a couple with Gregg. Are you at all worried that that's going to hurt you at some  point in this big, happy family? <br/>I do worry about that a little bit. Um, but I do think that we're both playing a very individual  game. <br/>I think people know that Jenn and I do have a bond and a  relationship, and, you know, it wasn't malicious or even strategic for me to  want to spend some time with her. But that's not gonna have people turn against each other or, you  know, change your strategy for just one day away. <br/>Probst: Caryn, back to you. You were first out. You brought more than anybody tonight. It looks like you brought everything you have. <br/>I've been carrying my stuff to every Tribal Council. Janu, Willard, Coby and I were not part of the five-person  alliance. So... I always feel vulnerable. <br/>Probst: Tom, it's now down to six people who have been  together from day one. Has it changed how you think about voting somebody out? Because you're gonna hurt somebody. Somebody's going home tonight, and they're moving right over  there. <br/>Right. We are friends, and we are looking to slit each other's throats  at night. I think that right now you do have an "all is fair in love  and war" attitude that's all about advancing your move down the board. <br/>Probst: All right, Ian, once again, you have the immunity  necklace. It is yours to keep or give up to somebody else. <br/>Um, I think I'll hold on to it tonight. <br/>Probst: With that, it is time to vote. Tom, you're up. <br/>Gregg, you're the dark horse. And it's just time for the dark horse to ride off into the  sunset. I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final-- person voted  out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote. Caryn. Caryn. Two votes Caryn. Gregg. Two votes Caryn, one vote Gregg. Gregg. Two votes Caryn, two votes Gregg. Gregg. That's three votes Gregg, two votes Caryn. I'll read the last vote. 13th person voted out of Survivor: Pala and the fourth member of  our jury... Gregg. <br/>You guys are good. <br/>Probst: You need to bring me your torch. Gregg, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Well, the message seems clear-- with six days left, nobody's  safe anymore. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on... Survivor. <br/>I don't really have a deal with Tom. <br/>We know you have a deal with Tom. <br/>Probst: The women compare notes. <br/>Katie just cleaned house. <br/>Probst: And Ian and Katie have a blow-out. <br/>You said you would never lie to me, and you did. <br/>Damn! <br/>You didn't even think about how that was gonna make me  feel to have you go against your word. <br/>You want me to step out? I mean, I'll do it. I'll do it. <br/>I think I'd be lying if I said I wasn't completely  surprised. My hat's off to 'em, though. They got me, they got me good. Um, I learned a lot of things. An experience is nothing unless you share it with other people  who you love. Jenn, best of luck. I appreciate your friendship out on the island, and, uh, look  forward to... hanging out soon.
