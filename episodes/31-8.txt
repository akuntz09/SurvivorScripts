<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," in a season of second chances,  everyone was trying to change their history in the game.  I just want to do everything that I didn't do the first time. Go big or go  home.  I'm actually making relationships that have saved me.  I've been kicking myself for not getting rid of the golden boy last time.  Jeff: At the merge, everyone was battling for numbers.  Let me tell you who is on the list and you toll me if you think they're in.  You have to hit the ground running to be in the majority.  But for Joe, the number-one priority was winning. Joe wins first individual  immunity. Back at camp, Kass was in trouble and looking to make a big move.  At tribal council, Ciera was on board.  We're second-time players, play to win.  Jeff: But not everyone was ready to pull the trigger. First member of our  jury -- leaving Ciera, Abi and wentworth on the bottom -- Kass, the tribe has  spoken. 12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?  Brilliant plan executed to perfection.  Yeah, that was good.  Last tribal council was unbelievable. My first goal of "Survivor"  was to make the jury. I’m like, wow, I did it. It's not often in life that  you have these really huge, hunking dreams that you carry for years and  years, and then suddenly it happens. Now it's day 20. My job is to keep my  alliance solid, kind of ole school and just stay the course, pick off the Cieras  and Abis and wentworths. I’m always thinking about Ciera.  I play the game with the guys. You, me and Joe. They're going to try to make  a move at some point. We can figure out when that is.  I know they're planning a big move. I can see it in their eyes. And the trick  is to figure out who they're trying to get out and try to offset it as best  we can. It's going to be a good day today.  Yeah, it is.  How you feeling after last night?  Okay. Like I expected i'd get some votes, but, I mean, this game is always  changing. At this point I’m on the bottom of this totem pole, so I’m going to  be throwing anything I can throw and trying to get somebody to, you know,  catch on to it. You guys have the numbers, so it's not like I can... My hands  are somewhat tied. I think Stephen wants to make a big move. I just think  he's waiting for the right time. And it's all about convincing steven that  this is the right time.  Obviously it's going to fracture at some point. I want to start setting  things up now that will pay off later.  I'm going to tell you this then: If it were up to me, I would make a move  against Joe if he lost.  Sierra's clearly in a bad position, but we have one thing in common. We're  both going to make a move that we need to make to get ourselveses into a  winning position. We don't need everybody. You just need six at this point.  Six, yeah.  Ciera wants to flip the game on its head. I do, too. I don't want to be run  over. It's time to go for someone who is a real threat to win this game.  Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. You guys ready to get to today's reward  challenge?  Yes.  Jeff: For today's challenge we're going to divide up into two teams of six.  On my go you're going to paddle out to a series of crates. You'll jump in,  untie the crate, get in your boat and continue on. Once you have all your  crates, you will stack them so that there are no repeating colors on any  side. First team to finish wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for?   Yes.  Jeff: The winning six will be taken to the "Survivor" cafeã where you will start with iced  coffee, bagels and cream cheese, cookies. You're going to o.d. On caffeine  and sugar and return to camp hopping around like little bunnies. First time  we did a paddling challenge was in season one when Kelly Wiglesworth, the  river rafting guy, the woman who makes her living paddling, lost to gervase  15 years ago. Do you still remember that moment?  Yeah, he couldn't swim, by the way. I’m helping you out.  Jeff: The tai shen kuo was, "i lost to the guy who can't swim." so  big second-chance opportunity for Wiglesworth. We're going to do a schoolyard  pick and we'll get started. All right. Our schoolyard pick has given us two  teams. Wentworth, Kimmi, Wiglesworth, Joe, Ciera, and Keith taking on Tasha, Savage,  Spencer, Jeremy, Fishbach and Abi. Here we go. Survivors ready? Go! Got to  get everybody in the boat. Then you start paddling.  One, two, three, go!  Jeff: You're going to paddle straight down the middle.  Paddle.  Jeff: Joe and Keith having trouble.  Watch yourself. Watch yourself.  What are you guys doing?  Jeff: Once again Wiglesworth's team in trouble with the paddling. You have to  go all the way out around your flag. Then you start collecting plates. She  got her team back on track and we're at the turn dead even. Now they're going  to run into each other, and you've got to crisscross to get to your first  crate. Joe has pushed the other team way off course.  Becomewards, guys, backward.  Jeff: Keith in the water for the glen team.  You got it, Keith.  Jeff: Abi now in the water for her team. Keith has first box untied. Abi  still working on that first crate.  Left.  Ouch.  Jeff: It is Joe, Ciera, Wiglesworth, wentworth, Kimmi and Keith in the lead. Keith  back in the water.  Grab that.  Jeff: Abi finally has the knots undone.  All right. Let's go.  Jeff: Joe trying to pull in that second box. They are heavy. Here comes the  purple team.  I can do it.  Jeff: Here comes Spencer with a second crate for his team. He's replaced Abi.  Big lead right now for green. Wiglesworth's tribe has two crates. Spencer has  the second crate for his team. Purple is fighting to catch up. And a disaster  as Spencer falls in. Got to get back in the boat.  Go, go.  Jeff: Keith untying that third crate for his team. Joe and Keith working  together very well on these crates.  They aboy, Keith.  Jeff: Green with a one-full-crate lead. Spencer back in the water looking for  that third crate.  Get it, Joe. Get it, Joe.  Jeff: Joe going to go in the water this time for that fourth and final crate.   I'm on the ground. I’m on the ground.  Jeff: When it gets shallow you can push it.  Keep it steady.  Jeff: Spencer still working the knot for the third crate for his team. As he  does, his team drifts further away from him, forcing Spencer to swim to the  boat.  Good job, spence.  Jeff: Joe has the fourth crate. They're heading to the beach.  Come on, guys.  Jeff: Big time advantage.  Keith, you got one?  I don't know. Can I get it?  Kimmi, you got it?  Go! Come on, let's go!  Jeff: Everybody working together with those crates. Joe taking one alone.  That is how you get it done on "Survivor." they'll have a big lead  if they start working on the puzzle. Spencer back in the water. They've got a  lot of time to make up.  Sorry.  You're good. You're good.  Jeff: Purple finally has that fourth crate. Spencer's got to get on the boat.  Let's go! Keith, Joe, Wiglesworth, Kimmi, Ciera and wentworth have all their  crates. Start stacking. Let's go! You got to get them up the beach. It's  going to make a lot of teamwork to make up this time loss. The crates are  hard to lift. Get them in the structure. Jeremy heaving one on his shoulder.  He's doing the work of two people. Got no get all four crates in the spot  before you start working the puzzle. Now you're looking for no repeating  colors on any side. You see the same color, it's not right.  That's not going to work. That's not going to work.  That one's wrong. That has to be switched.  Jeff: A lot of teamwork from purple right now and a lot of progress quickly.  They're back in it. We're very close again. Everybody now working on their puzzle.   Turn it, turn it.  Jeff: All you're looking to do is have no repeating colors.  I got yellow, green, green, red.  The other way, Savage. Yes! One more. Yes!  Jeff: When you think you have it, let me know.  We've got it, Jeff.  Jeff: No, no, you have repeating red.  Oh, almost.  Keep going, keep going, guys.  Jeff: Fishbach thought he had it. He's wrong. Got to try something different.   Sorry.  Green on your side.  I got green here.  That's it, that's it. That's it!  Yes.  <br/>We got it!  Jeff: Reward for Kimmi, Ciera, wentworth, Wiglesworth and Joe. Huge victory. Wiglesworth,  part of the idea of this second-chance season is to rid yourself of those  things that have haunted you. Does this rid that memory of losing to gervase  15 years ago?  Yeah, I’m not going to lie. It feels awesome.  Jeff: All right. Nice reward. You'll be taken to the Survivor cafeã, coffee, sandwich, desserts.  Should be a nice break, and give therein are still so many people left in  this game, who knows what it will do to the strategy. Grab your stuff. Head  out. Enjoy the afternoon.  Thanks, Jeff.  Jeff: Spencer, ab, a Fishbach, tashback Jeremy, Savage, got nothing for you.  Grab your stuff, head back to camp.  The thought of Joe and the girls being able to work together is terrifying. But  this gives him a chance to get into their head, and that could ruin  everything.  Oh, my gosh, you guys. Getting to the reward, they drove us in on this  little, I don't know what they're called. They're like bike things. And we  walk in this cool little cafeã.  Enjoy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I was so super excited. It was my first time ever going on a reward with food  either season. So it was so super special for me. It was nice to get a little  glimpse of what life is like outside the game for just a little while.  Wow.  This is amazing.  This is super fun.  Everybody had such good teamwork. That's what they were lacking over there I think.   Rewards are extremely important. It gives you perfect time to talk tract.  When people have a second to relax, they can maybe see the light of day, so I  really look at it as an opportunity to plan plant a few more seeds and build  a few more relationships.  What I was saying last night about playing, I didn't mean it to offend  anybody. I’m just saying on my first season, there was a tight group, and I was  in that group. I thought eventually i'd be able to make a move, but then all  my numbers were gone. At this point I don't have anything to lose. So I’m fishing.  I’m just letting that line out and waiting for anybody to take the bait  hoping that somebody out there wants to play the same game I’m playing. And  let me tell you, this Jeremy, tash, yeah Stephen and Savage, they're not  breaking up.  I'm with Bayon. They know I’m riding with them, but Ciera is right. I know  that they're tight. I know they don't want me with them at some point.  Jeremy is smart and Stephen is smart.  Stephen will try make a move.  Yes, he will. He knows numbers. He knows this game. Trust me.  People will only be loyal so long, and I myself am only going to be loyal so  long. So it's just matter of making sure I make a move at the right team with  the right people.  What are them things called, rickshaw... No. Let me go out here and just  look. I used to have a trail 70. Don't drink and drive. Let me see if I can  get it cranked. I think I’m in gear.  Don't break it. [engine revs] [cheering]  we're going to see Keith in ten years retired on the beach, and this is what  he's going to be doing.  I need some passengers. We don't have no beach in louisiana that you can roll  up on to, so this is a once-in-a-lifetime deal. Here I am driving the uk-tuk  on the beach in cambodia with my wasdy, hauling them around like a taxi  driver.  Let's see if this baby is four-wheel drive.  I ought to get my cambodia driver's license. That would be something slick.  You call, we'll haul. Call me up and i'll come get you. [laughter]  i can't deal with this. I’m having a real low moment.  Get over it.  I don't know why I’m taking it so hard. I apologize for being...  Debbie downer.  Typically on "Survivor" I always tell myself, the reward doesn't  matter, but for some reason this loss today, this loss of food, this loss of  a chance to bond, this loss of energy for later in the game just really set  me off. The reward helps and it feels great and then it's over.  I also lost... Some of the bonds made on the reward never recovered.  You think they're bonding over there?  Well, I don't know how much it happens in general or how much... What's  happening now.  The people I need to make a big move, they're off on their reward bonding  with Joe. Joe's the enemy. That could be terrible for me. That's my  nightmare. So I see it pulled out of my grasp again because of some stupid  food reward challenge. I've just been thinking I don't want to spend days  getting rid of the Cieras and Abis of the world when there are real threats  in the game.  That's not what's going to happen. We're not going to do that.  I was thinking if Joe loses it could be a chance to get Joe out.  Since day one Stephen has been trying to get Joe out an I was reluctant  because I view Joe as a shield. But every time Joe wins, it just keeps  getting that bull's-eye bigger and bigger on his back. So the first time Joe  loses, he could be going home.  I don't want us to be trying to pull together a plan. I’m down for it.  I just don't want to be the guy pulled until the end. That means I have to  get to the front seat and drive. I was thinking if Joe lost, I could get to  votes to blindside him this coming tribal council. This is the merge on the  "Survivor" all-star season to star targeting physical threats. I think  the likelihood of the blindside increases.  That's my thought, too. He'll never see it now. I’m willing the play ball.  Stephen wants Joe out. He's doing what he needs to do to get it done. Any  time you go into an immunity challenge, whatever it is, Joe is a good bet to  win. You'd be crazy not to vote him out the second you get the chance.  I just wanted to check in with you. I have a few things on my mind. I've just  been thinking, if Joe loses, we think about voting him.  It's a possibility.  We have the numbers to do it. But obviously it would have to be a blind side.   Today I heard Stephen trying to put together a blindside of Joe. The  scheming, lying, deceit it's disgusting. I have a great alliance with Joe. I love  the guy, so he's not going anywhere. If I have to go toe to toe with steven,  bring it on.  Good morning.  Rise and shine.  What's up, dude?  Got a minute?  Yeah.  We got a problem. Stephen is diabolical. He keeps throwing your name out.  He's saying, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe. He's going to make a huge move very soon.  This morning Savage told me that Stephen is gunning for me. No surprise. He's  a smart guy. And I know I’m a threat. So I knew this was coming. But I didn't  expect it so soon.  I need you the look me in the eye, from the bottom of my heart on my kids'  life I will never write your name down.  At this point I trust Savage. I feel like he's looking out for my best  interests, but if Stephen has rallied the numbers to vote me out, if I don't  win immunity, I’m gone.  Jeff: Come on in, guys.  All right.  Jeff: All right. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?  Yes.  Jeff: First things first, Joe. Got to take it back.  All right. Buddy.  Jeff: Thank you. Witness again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's  challenge you're going to balance a ball on a disk attached to a rope. At  regular intervals you will move your hands further down the rope making it  more difficult to balance. If at any point the ball drops, you're out of the  challenge. Last person left standing wins immunity, safe from the vote,  losers tribal council where somebody will be the eighth person voted out and  the second member of our jury. This challenge has run one time. Keith and Jeremy  participated. Jeremy, you were...  Thanks, Jeff.  Jeff: First out. And Keith won. So big second-chance story. We'll draw for  spots and we'll get started. All right. Everybody is in first position, and  this challenge is on.  Oh, my God.  Anchor: And seconds in wentworth is out followed right behind by Ciera.  That's how fast your fate in this game can change. You have to be on at all  times. And Kelly Wiglesworth drops. Jeremy cannot recover. Jeremy is out.  This challenge is moving quickly. Kimmi's ball on the move. Can she save it?  Yes. Nice job. Abi starts to roll. Abi cannot recover. Abi is out. We are  down to seven. Fishbach drops. Fishbach is out. We are down to six. Kimmi's  ball continuing to move. No sooner said, Savage's ball on the move out of  nowhere. Savage can't control it. Savage is out of this challenge. We are  down to five. Keith, Joe, Spencer, Tasha, and Kimmi. We'll go ten minutes in  this first round. Then we will move further back on the rope, and it will get  more difficult. All right. Everybody has proved into the second position.  Your hands are now further become on the rope, which is going the make this  much more difficult. We will stay here for ten manslaughter before we move  even further back. Kimmi right on the edge, and another nice save and another  one. Kimmi staying in this challenge and still pulling it off. The luck runs  out. Kimmi drops out. An we're down to four. Tasha drops. She is out. We're  down to three. Three men, Keith, Joe and Spencer. Keith won it the first time  we did it. Would love to repeat. Joe and Spencer would like the the -- to  steal it. All three guys, keep doing what you're doing because it's working.  All right. Everybody is in position. Hands back at the furthest part of the  rope. This is the furthest you can go. Keith looking to retain the title. Joe  and Spencer looking to knock him down. There is nothing better than having  that necklace around your neck when you come into tribal council. Keith with  a little bit of movement, but a nice recovery. A little bit of movement by Joe.  Spencer is out. No shot at immunity. We're down to two. It is Keith versus Joe  for immunity. We will stay in this section for ten more minutes, and if you  survive this, we will add a second ball. Keith and Joe both have two balls on  their disc. No time limit in this round. We just go until it's over. Keith  now with a little bit of movement. One ball was tough, two is definitely more  than twice as hard. Those balls start to go in opposite directions, you're in  trouble. You can't afford any movement. Keith won it at this same stage the  first time we did it in blood versus water. Joe's balls start to move. A  little bit of movement by Keith. A little bit of a breeze. Joe's balls move a  little more. The wind starting to pick up now causing Joe's balls to move.  Once again he settles back in. Keith solid. Yes's balls start to move.  Beautiful recovery. Yes's balls moving again. Now both are on the move. Keith  starting to move. Keith drops. Joe wins his second individual immunity  challenge. Joe, come on over.  Good job, Joe.  Good job, Joe.  Jeff: For the second time, immunity, you're the only person the wear the  necklace in this game. Joe safe tonight at tribal council. As for the rest of  you, after 21 day, somebody going home tonight. Grab your stuff.  Thank God I won immunity. I know my name is being floated around everywhere,  so let's go get Stephen, so he threw my name out there. We need to get him  out.  Good job, Joe.  That was awesome.  You were amazing.  I couldn't let Keith beat me.  You killed it, dude.  Didn't give it enough.  Joe.  I'm so frustrated. I have been working on getting Joe out since the game  began, and once again he wins freaking immunity. It's like moby dick, Joe is  my white whale, and I’m ahab on a crazy quest to eliminate Joe, and he keeps  evading us.  Where's your head at?  Look, I think Stephen's got to go. He's so dangerous.  Jeremy?  I think we have a couple more on board for sure.  Let me know.  Thanks.  Voting out Stephen would be a pretty big move, but for me, it's pretty simple:  Stephen is throwing my name out there, so we need to get rid of him. And I’m going  to use the three girls who are on the bottom to do it.  This is like kind of a big vote, but it's there's this cool thing we could  do, Savage wants Stephen out.  He does?  Which is great. Fantastic.  Oh, my God, you're so evil right now.  Yes.  Ciera, Abi and myself, we're on the bottom, so I thought I was totally  screwed. Then out of nowhere, Joe tells me, hey, I’m going to blindside Fishbach.  I’m like, fantastic. Love it.  I'm writing that name.  No matter what.  No matter what.  Okay. Then that's what I’m going to do, fish. This is huge, and it's true. I have  an idol, but I don't want to use it this early in the game if I don't have  to.  This has to stay between you and me, promise to God. Fishbach, total  mindside. Joe said I’m writing fish tonight.  I'm so down with that.  At this point I would be okay with anybody as long as it wasn't me or you.  I know. I’m going to keep my mouth shut.  Me too.  He's really dangerous. He's still acting like he's Bayon strong and all that,  and he's not. I know his big move is coming. I think we got to let him go.  What's up, what's up?  We all good? Are we still talking about it?  Fishbach?  He's been bringing up Joe's name, and he's a huge threat.  Savage, now he wants to take out Stephen because he's been trying to get rid  of Joe. But I just feel like that would be a bad move for me because Stephen  has been with me for 20 days. I've been building trust with him, so I want Stephen  to come with me far into this game. Because once the big guys start going at  each other, I want to have all the bullets.  He prides himself on being the greatest strategist in the history of "Survivor."   i hear, that I understand 100%, but this is the thing, I don't want to let  the girls get too strong. I kind of feel like we know what he wants to do,  and he's not going to be able to do it without us cooperating.  True.  I just think we take out wentworth or Ciera. If we take another one down and  then we can start trimming the fat on our side, you know what I mean?  You guys make great arguments. I'll do whatever the group wants to do.  As a lawyer, I pleaded my case, and I’m used to kind of getting what I want,  and I didn't, so I’m disappointed, but Jeremy made a valid point. Those two  girls are dangerous. We just have to figure out who is going home tonight.  What's going on? There's a lot of running around?  Okay. None of us trust Stephen, but we don't want to take out Stephen and  take a divide.  Oh, man.  That makes me nervous.  I'm thinking, okay. It's going to be Stephen. I’m going to reconfirm with  everybody. But Stephen apparently has more connections in this game than I realized.   What's the word, bird?  No bueno?  No Stephen in  travis was all for it.  He has something deeper with Fishbach.  Exactly.  So is the word wentworth or me now?  Me, right?  I don't know yet.  One minute we're going to blindside Fishbach. And the next thing I know, that  plan has totally fallen aside. Joe will not vote, so he's dead to me. The  great thing about tribal is it's not over until it's over. I’m so fricken  tired of their half-ass plans. Who are you going to vote for?  Would it matter if it's Fishbach or Savage?  I think we all should vote for the same person.  That's what I’m saying. Let's decide.  I've been begging these people the wake up to, play the game, but I’m playing  with a bunch of people who don't want to make moves, so at this point I am  scared for my life. I guess I’m hoping for a miracle at tribal council  ideally.  Jeff: We bring in the first member of our jury, Kass voted out at the last  tribal council. All right. So let's pick up where we left off at the last  tribal, Ciera. You didn't think people were playing. Did that theme continue  on after tribal?  Yes. It's the same thing, different day. Nobody is fighting for their spot in  the top. It's frustrating for me.  Jeff, I’m going the lay it out here right now. There are four people running  this game. That's the bottom line. So if we're going to go one by one up the  ladder, and that's it.  Jeff: But if it's only four people, that leaves eight other people that  should be able to swallow those four.  That's what you would think, but nobody wants to make a move.  Jeff: Ciera, you want people to make big moves, make one. Who are the four  people?  Yes, Jeff. The four are Jeremy, Savage, Tasha, Stephen or Joe.  Jeff: Jeremy, there is a consistent group of names that keep getting called  out as the core, and you are in it.  Yeah, but the statement was there's four people running the show, and she  came up with five people, so they don't even know who is running the show.  Jeff: Joe, it doesn't matter if something is true or not. It only matters  what people believe.  Perception is truth, so the only guarantee of safety you have in this game is  this right here.  Jeff: Savage, your name was brought up as being one of the core, as well. How  does this feel having your name being tossed around?  Yes, there are a bunch of us that talk often. We have mutual respect for each  other. There's also a bunch of others that are at the same level at us who  are making decisions as a group.  Jeff: Ciera?  I can't believe anybody is buying that. If there is aballiance, somebody is  here on the top and somebody is on the bottom. Some people are great to be  able to say, we're in an alliance and everyone is equal and have people  believe it. More power to them. I’m frustrated with the people who can in the  out see and hear what they're saying and thinking, maybe I’m not at the top  and not acting. Time to wake up.  Jeff: Spencer, not only do we have returning players, we have people who have  had a lot of time to think about how they might react in a situation. So what  Ciera is saying may be true.  What Ciera's saying probably is true, and when you have returning players,  maybe they're waiting for someone to make some flip or maybe there's an idol  in play. We haven't seen any idols. Spencer, a couple times, it's been as if  nobody is really looking for the idols. Is that the feeling?  I think most people assume there are somehow not idols and they've been found  or they're waiting to be played.  Jeff: Savage, where do you fall with this make a big move plea that Ciera is  making?  It's fascinating. I think it's a plea that Ciera can make because she's not  in the alliance and she's at the bottom. If she were sitting in a few other  folks' position, she wouldn't be saying that.  I feel like you guess are all acting like I’m wanting something crazy to  happen. I’m not asking anybody to do anything bizarre. I’m asking you to  fight for your spot in the game, and I don't think that's so big.  I don't agree there is a bottom here.  You wouldn't.  I honestly think the way we've played is different than all of the 30  previous seasons we've all studied and watched. We've swapped a dozen times.  We've all been playing really hard. It's not how it typically is.  But some things are flavor going to change. In an alliance, somebody is on  the top and somebody is on the bottom. Some of you know you're not in the  tight four and they're still not doing anything about it. That's where I’m frustrated.   Jeff: Wentworth, what do you think will happen?  It's clear that Abi, Ciera and myself are on the bottom, so it seems like the  easy vote would be one of us, but someone came to me today and said, I want  to make a big move. I didn't go to them.  Jeff: Your point is whatever people think is tight can't be because  somebody's already approaching you.  That's what I’m saying. It's not me on the bottom trying to make a big move.  I’m saying other people saying that to me.  Jeff: Why wouldn't you out those people if you're truly on the bottom and  desperate?  Well, what if I’m here tomorrow and I have to work with them?  Jeff: Joe, this is tough. Everywhere you turn, there's another obstacle. It's  like playing chess you don't know which pieces are which ones. It's  nerve-racking, it's exciting. I expected nothing less.  Jeff: All right. Let's find out where it's going the fall. It is time to  vote. Wiglesworth, you're up.  I would have tried the same plea you made if I were in your spot. Luckily I’m  not.  Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol awb you  want to play it, now would be the time to do so.  You know what, Jeff, I may be on the bottom, but I’m not ready to go home yet.   Oh, my God.  No way!  Oh, my God.  You didn't know?  No.  I had no idea.  This is my favorite moment.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God. &gt;&gt;i love this.  Done.  Wow.  Yes.  Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for wentworth will not  count. I'll read the votes. First vote wentworth. Will not count. Wentworth.  Will not count. Wentworth. Will not count. Wentworth. Will not count.  Wentworth. Will not count.  Funny.  Jeff: Wentworth. Will not count. Wentworth, will not count. Wentworth, will  not count. Wept worth, will not count. Savage.  All right, baby. Eighth person voted out and the second member of our jury, Savage.  Bring me you torch.  I'm loyal to the people that i'm, with y'all.  Love you.  Jeff: Savage, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go.  Good luck, Andrew.  He made it to the jury.  Right back at you.  Jeff: Well, tonight's tribal centered around when is somebody going to make a  big move. Turns out it was tonight. Grab your torches. Head back to camp.  Good night. Tuned for scenes from our next episode.  Jeff: Next time on "Survivor"...  We have to go find an idol.  Everyone is looking for an advantage in the game.  You just don't know where it is.  Jeff: But what they don't know is that it's right in from the of them. I’m going  to give you a chance the change your situation. First person to touch their  buoy earns an advantage in the game.  That's stunning. No one saw that coming. Wentworth did, but i'll be darned. I  did some things out here that I didn't do 12 years earlier. I proved at least  in my mind I can hang with some unbelievable Survivors. I played the game,  the strategy game pretty darn well, except for a few minutes ago. Not going  to lie, it rips my heart out.
