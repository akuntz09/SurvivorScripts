<br/>the winner of this show is on this matt. -blue collar, ride or die -if you're  not getting your hands dirty, you're not going to win. My hands are going to  be filthy.  You flipped. I flipped.  You better relax.  When you're feeling like everything is going against you, you keep digging  within yourself. This is what you find.  Mike wins individual immunity. Mike wins.  This guy is unbeatable.  Mike wins his fifth individual immunity.  We do the happy Dance, baby. We do the happy Dance. [cheering and applause]  Jeff: Welcome to the "Survivor" live reunion show in los angeles  where Mike has just won our 30th season. Congratulations.  Good job, baby.  Jeff: Nicely done. You know, I’m curious about something, because your back  was up against the wall for so long that it allowed you to play more  aggressively and a lot looser. Is there anything to take from that, either  for "Survivor" or just in life in general, that when you play more  loosely, you seem to... In life do you do better doing that?  The reason I’m able to play loosely is because somebody paid the price for my  sins many years ago, jesus christ. He allowed me to do this right and have  fun...  Jeff: I’m talking specifically from a strategy point of view, you had... No, I’m  not discounting what you said, but I mean, you might not have played with  that cavalier attitude if you didn't have... You had nothing to lose.  Well, your back is completely up against the wall and you know what position  you're in, in this game and the only person you can trust is yourself, you're  able to make moves that otherwise you may not have been able to have the  forethought to make.  <br/>Jeff: So for people who get a second chance the play, we'll reveal later,  what's the lesson from, look, I played much better.  Go get firewood.  Jeff: The blue-collar work ethic.  Those firewood walks were strategy talks, looking for the idol.  Jeff: Code. We're going to get firewood. All right. Well, the moment that  really put your back up against the wall and allowed you this aggressive  approach was when, in the auction, Mike tried the make a massive move.  I can't explain it.  But you just bought it for $20.  Thank you.  Jeff: All right. Nice. Mike, did you...  He didn't do it.  Jeff: Wow. Yeah, that one even got me. That took me by surprise. So now, at  the final tribal, you said to Dan that you regretted going back on your word,  but we were still in the game. I’m curious, did you regret that move?  I regretted giving him my word and then turning back on the word, I would not  have regretted the move, the move was right, from a game standpoint, they all  gave you your money, take the advantage, go, but in this game, I was not...  That was the one time in this game when I stopped playing for about two  seconds.  Jeff: So it's a mistake because you got all the plame for the rest of the  game and you didn't get any reward.  Horrible strategy to not take it. Game play strategy, because...  Jeff: Because once you committed... You're guilty. Have you mended fences. At  the very end, Dan said, maybe, if we're big enough men, can you do it?  Well, Dan and I are both big enough men.  More than big enough. Thanks. Appreciate that analogy.  We flew up to maine to hang out. So we're pretty good.  Jeff: You're good. All right.  More than good.  Jeff: I’m glad to hear that. Rodney, first of all, hello, look at this suit.  Wow.  Hey, hey...  Jeff: Here's my question for you... [cheering and applause] go ahead, show  that off. Here's any question for you: Had you won that fire making  challenge, do you believe you would have won the game?  I mean, I didn't win iwill the of challenges. Let's be real. Black home I play  basketball, I play football, and these challenges didn't fit with what I would  do. So the social game and the hustle --.  Jeff: Yes or, no you're making your case to the jury, I think I had a really  great shot of winning that game because of the simple fact of the matter is  where the auction is where Rodney solidified where what he had. I had blues and  my axis of evil azua lines. Joe, get a big shot. Carolyn is not in the final  three. Rodney is. It's everybody else but Carolyn. Show of hands on the jury,  how many votes does Rodney get if it is Mike, Rodney and will? Wait, three?  Yeah.  Jeff: So you were in it, but you're still short. How many for Mike? All  right. So Mike still pulls that out. Carolyn, are you surprised how few votes  you got given the game you played?  Pretty surprised, yeah. I thought for sure that I would get a lot more votes.   Jeff: Are you proud of how you played?  I’m very proud of how I played. [applause]  Jeff: How much, now that you know you didn't win, how much of your mind is  occupied by that second chance because you're on the ballot?  Yeah, it's pretty occupied.  Jeff: All right. Where is Joe? Joe, Joe... [cheering and applause]  knock it off.  Jeff: You know what,, I’m not going to play you tape piece because it reminds  everybody how cool you are and we already know that as evidenced by, we don't  have a lot of time tonight, so many people, these are some of the tweets I got  from jeanette, "ball my eyes out because Joe got voted out." gab  says, that's first time I cried because someone got voted off of "Survivor"."  I love Joe and his precious man bub. It goes on and on. So are you feeling...  You're one of the most popular of 30 seasons. Are you feeling that love in  your daily life?  Yeah, you know, I’m feeling it from family, friends, you know, strangers on  the street. It's pretty cool.  Jeff: How about this. This is a question and maybe an offer from atkari lo  dow, are you single?  I’m single. I’m single. Yes. Yeah. [cheering and applause]  Jeff: Okay. Usually guys have to approach women. That's normally how it goes.  Are women approaching you?  A little bit. Yeah. Maybe just a little bit. I’m used to taking a girl out to  dinner and picking her up. I think more people want to pick me up now.  It's... The role reversal is a little... It's nice to see, the other side of  it I guess.  Jeff: I bet. I bet it is. Joe also on the second chance ballot. If enough of  you voted and enough of you at home will get so' him play again, maybe Carolyn  play again. All right. Still to come tonight, we reveal next season's cast of  second chances. You guys chose them. They are ready to go. They are aching  behind the stage. Up next, three of the most controversial players from this  season, they know who they are, Rodney, will and Dan. They made a lot of  comments about women. We'll address all of it. It's the "Survivor: White  collar, blue collar, no collar" reunion show.  We're like apples and oranges, brother. We're like chicken apartment and tuna  fish.  This is what "Survivor" is about, baby. I went on every single  award. Keep it real, man. I’m the realest player  Jeff: Welcome back to the live reunion show. It's been a long time since  we've had one topic dominate a season. This season the topic was sex im. A  lot of comments made to and about the women on the show. It was Rodney, will  and Dan that took the most heat. We'll start with Dan, who lived up to his  goal of being remembered.  Yeah.  When you listen like a girl, you just smile and nod, yes, dear, I understand.   Yeah, your mother's a...  Close your mouth, open your ears. She loves to play the victim. My scenario  really isn't much different than hers.  Jeff: So you had domestic violence in your upbringing?  I’m an adopted child. Maybe she's an idiot savant. I’m leaning more toward  the idiot side.  Somebody slap this woman. For the love of god just slap her and shut her up. I’m  actually just trying to be nice. I truly am.  Jeff: All right.  Go ahead. Boo me.  Jeff: Dan, since you were voted out, you guys always do press. You've been  very vocal in the press that you did feel that you were misrepresented and  some of your comments taken out of context, and I want you to feel heard, do  you still have that frustration overall?  I certainly do have that frustration. A lot of things that I said... That  commend I made...  Jeff: Let's go through them.  The comment in the are river about Sierra, that was not directed at her. That  was 100% out of context. However...  Jeff: Dan. Hold on. We'll get to them. Let's start with a couple that you  took the most heat on because we don't have iwill the of time.  Okay.  The Shirin comment where you said, "somebody slap this woman, for love  of god, slap her and shut her up already." what's your frustration with  that?  Number one, I had no idea about Shirin's past. I would inner have made that  comment.  Stop there, because number two doesn't exist. You're saying... Are you saying  by, that Dan, that if there's a situation which it would be okay?  Okay, again, if you would let me finish, i'll tell you.  Jeff: Okay.  How many times has anybody said, god, I could just kill this person? Do you  go home and plot murder? It was an expression. That's all it was. I did not  mean it literally. And more importantly, I’m sorry. I don't care about you,  the people at home or even you. I care about you. And right now, I am telling  you, from my heart, I’m sorry. I am genuinely truly sorry. I've said it  before, and i'll say it again. I own up to my faults and I own up to my  successes. That was a fault and I’m sorry. I was wrong. &gt;&gt;however...  Jeff: Dan, hold on. We can't do an hour.  I don't want to do an hour.  Jeff: I love you --  this is not a season about the negativity. I want the season to be about  positivity. You always told thus was our season.  Jeff: I didn't know how this was going to go, but you said a lot in the press  that was not positive about the show, and one of your big comments was when  you called Rodney's mom, you said, yeah, your mother is a whore.  &gt;&gt;right?  Yes.  Jeff: Your frustration is...  Again, out of context. When you know your friends, you make your mama jokes.  I had passed out after that water bucket challenge we had just been talking  about those jokes. All of that was left out.  Jeff: I don't want you to feel "60 minutes" here.  No I don't want to.  Okay. I pulled that scene. I pulled the raw footage of that seaboard --  scene. Because at a certain point I have to defend the show I work on and  love. I’m going to show the scene. This is very unusual. Never shown. This  this is raw footage.  Throw me under the bus.  Jeff: This is one camera. It's very boring. You'll see, wow, they do have a  lot of down time. This must be maddening, but you'll also see there are no  your mama jokes. You're talking about which reward you hope next one will be,  will it be fishing or a comfort, and Rodney's response to your comment  illustrates that there was no mama jokes going on. Take a look.  Tomorrow's going to be comfort, right?  Yes.  Either comfort, I hope it's fishing gear to be honest with you  hell, yeah.  I'd rather have fishing gear. I'd rather eat.  I'd rather have comfort all day long.  Really?  Yeah.  Got to have something to catch food. We've got to.  Blanket.  We walk in there and Jeff's like, look at all this fishing gear...  Rodney...  I've gotten like five hours of sleep.  Every night. &gt;&gt;er night, no way?  You're full of crap. You're the earliest one that goes to wed and the latest  one that gets up.  No way.  I love you, but it's true.  The census says that you, in fact, are the sleeper.  Haters.  Haters.  Because we tell the truth.  That's because you don't like the fact doesn't change the fact.  Go to bed, Dan. Nobody asked you.  Your mother's a [bleeped], too.  Whoa.  Wow, you just took it to a new level. You never mention my mother, brother.  Jeff: All right. So there was... And I watched all this footage. There was no  30 minutes of joking. So here's what I want know, watching that now, is it  possible you're just not remembering it correctly?  Clearly, just because you don't like the facts doesn't change the facts,  clearly I’m remembering it wrong.  Jeff: Here's what I’m wondering, Dan, words do matter, but so does the  intention behind it. I’m wondering if your intention is what's coming across,  do you have a prejudice against women?  I do not have a prejudice against women? I don't have a prejudice against  anybody. If I dislike you, you've earned that from me. People that know me  know that I will stand up... I’m with Rodney, we're from new england. Ly  stand up and die if you for f you're my friend.  Jeff: So maybe instead of us misrepresenting you on the show, maybe this is  case of you're not aware sometimes of how you come across to people when you  think you're going funny and they don't take it that way but you don't mean  to be hurtful.  I certainly didn't mean to be hurtful. I met Rodney's mom. I met Rodney's  sister. The first thing she did, she came up to me and gave me a hug and she  goes, "i knew you were kidding. I knew exactly what you meant."  Jeff: I think it's fitting because you bravely wore a shirt on a night when  you knew the topic was going to come up that says, let's get a shot of it,  because I know it doesn't mean anything, but it says mail escort. It's  spelled "mail" as in post office.  Jeff: That's my point. I wonder if that's what it is.  In this pc age it's so easy to say something to have it completely  misconstrued. That was not misconstrued.  Jeff: I appreciate...  I only meant to be funny. I apologized to Rodney and his mother. I obviously  put my foot in my mouth. I’m a guy who speaks his mind, and I don't always  get it right.  Jeff: And Dan, this doesn't mean you wouldn't be back on the show, because  this is what "Survivor" is about. This is why I love this show,  because you do take a group of people from different walks of life, you force  them into extreme conflict to work together but then vote each other out and  do it in a way that somebody will come back and vote for you to win. It's a  complicated game. One of the reasons you're interesting is you are so  compelling and you work so hard to impress, sometimes as you say, maybe you  put your foot in your mouth and you'll learn something from this.  But I don't work hard to impress. I told Tyler, I got two modes, awake and  asleep. This is who I am. And I screw up a lot.  Jeff: All right.  I eat a lot of crow.  Jeff: Well said. We still have Rodney and will to deal with and second  chancers. You can't get more "Survivor" than this tonight. We'll  take a break. We'll come back. A lot more show left.  I don't node a family because my biological father is just like you. He  verbally assaulted me all the time.  I didn't verbally saul you. I just called you out.  Shut up.  You play the victim.  Yeah, and I am a victim of domestic violence, as is my mother, and that is  why our family was torn apart, and this is why I do not have family at home.  Jeff: Welcome back to the reunion show. A lot of tough topics. Will, my  impression of you from the moment I met you, with the exception of that, is  you were always a good guy. That's how you came across. That reward, I know  what the truth was. You took all of it and gave it to everybody. They  questioned your integrity and you got upset, but take me back to the moment  to Shirin and I said, do you want to apologize, and you said no.  At that moment, when you want to apologize, you want to be sincere. You want  to know the person is going to be open the receive, that and we haven't  spoken in three days before, that so I knew she wasn't open to hearing an  apology, and I wasn't sincere enough to give one.  Jeff: So have you apologized to her.  I apologized to her at ponderosa and when the episode air, I sent a text to  her.  Jeff: Shirin, you're shaking your head. He didn't apologize?  At ponderosa he said, "it's all a game, baby girl, it's all a  game."  that's not what I said.  Jeff: How about we cut to the chase. Do you feel he's apologized, Shirin?  I don't feel like he's give an genuine apology. I feel like he stood by what  he did up through the episode, after the episode and only days afterwards  when the public opinion was largely negative did he then cave and send me a  weak apology, and I mean at this point, jonathan penner said, "values  change but wrong has no expiration." this is no longer about me. What he  did to me was wrong, but for me this is about using this plate form to raise  awareness...  Jeff: Would you accept an apology? Because I see you're trying to the unthis  into something positive. This would be positive if will... Do you want to  apologize to her?  I should apologize to her, because that's not the person I am. I'll take it a  step further, Jeff. I would want to apologize to Shirin's family out there,  because what I said to her was wrong. I’m not going to make any excuses about  being hungry or tired because we all were. I want to give you a genuine  apology, as well, like I did at pond row system. I had no idea about your  background, just like Dan, but regardless of that, I should have never spoke  to you that way and I’m sorry for what my words did and I hope you can truly  accept my apology because you have to get to a point where you have to  forgive, whether it's me or the people in you past, to be the person that god  wants you to be. I’m truly sorry. [applause]  Jeff: Accepted?  For me, to begin the forgiveness process, I have to understand why I don't  have a soul and why people without souls need to be treated that way, so that  he will never treat other people this way in the future, because if he treats  other people this way in the future, that's on me, and I can't let that  happen. Can we start the process? Yes.  He doesn't treat nobody that way.  Jeff: That's one of the things that "Survivor" does, is it forces  you to think about the things you say and the way you behave, not only as a  contestant under extreme conflict but just at home. You watch and say, I would  never say that. You say that all the time. &gt;&gt;i hope amith all this  negativity, we can end this segment. I have to say good-bye to you guys with Rodney.  There's so much we can talk about, but Rodney, I’m heartbroken that despite  being in a foreign country and playing a massively cool game that was  broadcast on cbs, every week in america in 140 countries around the world,  you were forced to endure the worst birthday of your life, and I want to make  it up to you. Just hang tight. Âª happy birthday to you happy birthday to you âª happy birthday dear Rodney  happy birthday to you âª  Jeff: Here you go. Got a little photo. A little hat. A hat here. And a noise  maker. There we go. All right. We have to say good-bye to our s. 30 cast.  This is it. The second chancers will be revealed next. That's the camry --  camera I was looking for.  Jeff: All right. Our 30th season is over. Time to find out who will be  playing in our 31st season. These are your choices. You'll been voting. Tens  of millions of votes cast from season 1 to season 30. We have a "Survivor"  bus outside ready to start the journey. Look at that. But before we do this,  I just want to say, the fact that all 32 of you showed up and braved a public  vote on national television, knowing some of you won't make it, speaks to the  motivation that it takes to play this game. And I’m sorry that all of you  can't play. I really am. It doesn't mean you won't get another shot, but here  we go. Give us the music, david. Kelly wigglesworth, season one, just give us  a little reminder, Joe, of what season one was like. Over 125 unique  individual, 125 million different people watched this moment right here when  richard hatch beat you by one vote. How long have you been thinking about a  second chance since then, Kelly wiggleworth.  15 years and you got a watch?  Jeff: I happen so happy to say, Kelly wigglesworth, you will get a second  shot. Get up on that stage. We have our first one. All right. Season two,  kimmie cappenburg and Jeff varner, "Survivor" australia. Kimmie  most famous for getting in a fight about a chicken. Are you still a  vegetarian?  I am.  Jeff stepped down from a challenge from peanut butter and got voted out. Are  you still eating peanut butter?  No. Haven't touched it in 14 years.  Kimmie cappenberg, you will get a second shot. Jeff varner, you will get a  second shot. Get up there. Get up there. Let's keep this train moving. You  know what, that's exactly how the vote went. People love you. You will get a  second shot. Wow. I see the looks on the faces. I empathize with the pain and  the anticipation you're feeling. All right. Let's get this, t-bird from  "Survivor" after cash one of the tough et cetera seasons we've ever  done that. Was very difficult. Stephanie from redemption island, difficult  for a different reason, you had to play with russell. And p.gold medal from  china, known from your fight, very close to getting to the end. One things  goes differently you might have won that game. One of you will get a second  shot. Two of you will not. T-bird, you will not get a shot. I’m sorry.  Stephanie valencia, you will not get a shot. P.g., you will get a second  shot. Get up on stage. This is the heartbreaking part. I do not like doing  this. I did not think it would be this tough. Sierra from blood versus water,  venus from blood versus water, same season. Sierra, this lovely little woman  voted out her mom, and vitus picked on his brother, and both of you will get  a second chance. Sierra will get a second chance, vitus will get a second  chance. Let's stay on this same row. Jim rice, great strategist, one of the  producers' favorite players of all time. We felt like your time was a little  short, and I’m sorry to say it's going the stay that way for now. Jim, you  will not get a second shot. I am truly sorry. Sabrina thompson, one world,  you played this season in which one woman, kim, dominated the game, but you  made it all the way to the end. In any other season, it might have been  enough to win, your second chance will have to wait. You will not get a  second chance. Terry dietz from panama, he finished third back when there was  only a final two, dominated in challenges. Andrew savage right next door from  the pearl islands, you were in a very good position when the outcasts pulled  you out of the game. A lot people may say you're similar, handsome, fit,  older guys. The question is would you cancel each other out and maybe neither  of you get on? Terry, dietz, did that did not happen for you, you will get a  second chance, get up on that stage. Andrew savage, been waiting how many  years?  12 years.  Jeff: 12 years. You will get a second chance. [cheering and applause] get up  there. Let's slide in here. Abby marie from the philippines, some would say a  villain, sitting next to kass that everyone would agree was a villain from  brains, brawn and beauty. The great thing about villains is they make the  show so much for money. Abby marie and kass, you will both get a second  chance. Get up there. Go. Good job. All right. Get this big shot. Because we  have four young, beautiful, smart strategists. One of the most lethal types  of people to play this game, natalie, Kelly, ma'keila and monica. Who of you  will get a shot, who of you will not. Monica, you will get a second chance.  Get up there. Kelly wentworth, you will get a second chance. I am sorry,  ma'keila, I am sorry, natalie, you will not get a second chance. All right.  You just finished an exhausting season and an exhausting final tribal council  live show. Carolyn, you made it to the finals. You couldn't play any harder. Shirin  shrouded in controversy, Carolyn, you will not get a second chance. Shirin,  you will get a second chance. Get up on that stage. While they hug it out,  Max a student of the game, so much so that you taught a college course, much  like jim rice, one of our favorite players to ever play, I mean, that I hope  you get another shot. It will not be tonight. Max does not get a second  chance. Steven and lou, both runners up, you lott to j.t., you lost to tony,  both of you will get a second chance to redeem. [cheering and applause] get  up there. I’m with you. I’m just finishing this up. Troy, Dan and tasha,  troy, Dan, you were on one world. You said, this is my island. We would hope  you get a sick chance, but you will not tonight. Tashback you will get a second  chance. Get up there. Jeremy and shane, polar opposites. Shane had an  imaginary blackberry that made everybody laugh. Jeremy had to go up and take  on his wife in the very first challenge of this season. Shane, you will not  get a second chance. Jeremy, you will get a second chance. And that leaves us  with two spots left, three people left. We have spencer, brad culpepper and Joe.  Brad, you're scratch lathing both guys. Brad, sadly, for once, you are right,  you will not get a second chance. Spencer will get a second chance, Joe will  get a second chance. [cheering and applause] get up there. There they are.
