<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," at the gen-x  tribe, Paul was in charge of an alliance of six. <br/>I 100% want to be in  control. That's why I have to be. <br/>Jeff: But the elements brought him down. <br/>It was heat exhaustion. <br/>Jeff: At the millennials tribe, Zeke, Adam, Hannah and Mari  wanted to dismantle the power couple. <br/>Taylor and he are really close. <br/> Jeff: Michelle had plans of her own. <br/>I might have to pull  strings at tribal council to make sure I have the numbers. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Michelle convinced Hannah and the  majority of the tribe to vote out Mari. Mari, the tribe has spoKen. Leaving Zeke and Adam on the outside. 18 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. <br/>Dude, what a vote. <br/>I've got to say, well played, everybody. <br/>Wow. <br/>That was nice. <br/>Wow. Taylor, Figgy, hats off to you guys. <br/>No hats off to us. Zeke and Adam were like, Taylor, Figgy, well done, I commend  you. It's like, it's not just us, buddy. There were seven votes. <br/>That did in the feel good. <br/>It didn't, at all. <br/>People who write down Figgy's name go home. <br/>I know you're mad. I'm going to try to be an adult about it and not play victim. <br/>Can we just talk tomorrow? <br/>I just want to say a few  things. I had no intention of doing that walking into tribal council. Michelle told me at tribal council that they had the numbers. I didn't see the point of voting at the bottom of the alliance. Even walking into tribal, I thought Figgy was going home. Michelle says, trust me, we have the numbers. And suddenly, I couldn't think of anything else. I did what I felt was best for my game. And I had to. And it sucked. I'm not looking for you to feel sorry for me, dude. I'm looking for you to...  I just would like to be  alone right now. <br/>Okay. You know how you're totally in control of the game and you're  totally excited to go the tribal council, and then, oh, wait, you get totally  blind sided? That's what happened at tribal council tonight. <br/>I don't care if you yell  at me. <br/>I just don't want to talk  to you right now. Can you give me some space. <br/>It was going to be a 6-4 vote, dude. <br/>Can you give me some space right now. <br/>That's all he's asking. <br/>But...  Can you respected that I don't want to talk to you right  now and just go talk to everyone else and maybe we'll talk later. <br/>I just want you  to...  No, look, look, look, I’m not going the saying I’m not  going to consider your argument. I'm upset right now. I'm particularly upset with you. Please give me a sec to breathe. <br/>I know, I know, I’m just  saying, before you breathe, just meditate on this. <br/>Hannah, please. <br/>He doesn't want to talk to you right now. He'll talk to you later. <br/>Just give me a second. <br/>During tribal the vote --  Oh, my God, Hannah, you're... Whatever. <br/>Okay. <br/>He just doesn't want to talk right now. <br/>Okay. Okay, guys. Okay. I'm the worst person ever. <br/>He's not saying that. He doesn't want to talk right now. <br/>I know that, Adam. <br/>Then don't play the victim right now. <br/>I’m not playing the  victim. <br/>Yes, you are. <br/>I’m not the victim. <br/>Talk to him later. <br/>Hopefully something can happen with Zeke and Adam. Hopefully I can repair enough to the point where we can work together  or maybe even Adam and Zeke can make a move using me. I want them to use me. Use me! I don't like everyone in this damn majority alliance. <br/>I this we just got to be  chill. <br/>I’m glad we were sitting  next to each other, though. Because at least I knew who was the other fool. <br/>That's me. You and me on dumb ass island. <br/>It's been my dream since I was nine years old to play this  game and have this experience, and I did not expect my first tribal council  to be my first #blindside. Now I’m going to have to play from the bottom. It's going to take a lot of work to get back into a position of  power. I wouldn't count me out. I think I can get back up to the top again. Âª âª âª âª  What a beautiful sky. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Red sky at night, sailor's delight. Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning. <br/>I have faith that things  are going to go in our favor. I trust God. I trust God. I prayed really hard. <br/>On my tribe right now I have a pretty good handle of  what's going on, and it's definitely me, Ken and CeCe on the bottom without  question. <br/>If you are next, I’m right after you. <br/>Yeah. And I know that. <br/>But I found an idol already. That was on my "Survivor" bucket list. There's hope for me. I an a general gen-xer, and I don't think you should ever give  up. <br/>Nice day, not too hot, nice little breeze. <br/>I feel like I’m back from  the dead. I feel awesome today. You want to talk about a guy who has come back from the dead, I went  from flat on my back to I feel like I just got here, like day one for me. I'm going to try to get us some fish. <br/>All right. Don't hurt yourself out there. <br/>No. <br/>Let us know if you catch something. We'd come help. <br/>I’m going to bring a  stringer and hopefully no sharks or barracudas try the take it away from me. <br/>I hear you. <br/>I’m going to let 'em have  it and we'll do the victory at sea dance. I live in the florida keys. For me to go shoot a nice yellow tail or something, I'll be back  in a minute and I get a couple of fish. Here's let's see if I’m as good as I think I am, because here I think  I’m really good. <br/>I need to chow on an  octopus or shark or something. <br/>Shark. <br/>How about a tuna, a yellow fin tuna. Why can't we catch that? <br/>Something we can chomp on for like a week. <br/>Boy, that current is strong this morning, buddy, it's  murked up really bad. I saw a couple nice big fish in, there but, man, you can't get  close to 'em. The yellow tails, I get up close to them, but the wave will pull  me back. <br/>Paul comes back, there's a school of yellow tail. Do you not see time and time again he says something and doesn't  follow through? Who do you want leading you into battle? <br/>That current whooped my ass. CeCe is on the outs. David is terrified of anything physical. What about Paul? Like what is he currently offering the tribe? He's not providing food. He's not providing shelter. And I’m baffled that I’m on the bottom. And I’m baffled that I’m on the bottom. <br/>Gather round, gather round. We've got tree mail. <br/>Read it. <br/>Call it a summit or call it recon, but call on four to go. Orange rock in your hand and you'll represent and return with  inside info. <br/>Wow. <br/>So it has to be a random draw. <br/>Grab it, don't look at it, and then we'll reveal all at  once. <br/>Adam comes back the camp with try mail. He has this bag of rocks. Whoever gets the orange rock will leave camp and go intermartin  luther kingle with the other tribe. And I think a lot of people don't want to go, but me being a  superfan, I want to be part of this. Why notwork with people from the our side if they help you  advance in the other game. <br/>One, two, three...  Boy. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Wow. <br/>You have to do the job of recon. <br/>We're losing will, Jay and Taylor. <br/>And Figgy. <br/>I’m the biggest boy in  camp. It's like just glorious who got to go. It's me, it's fig, it's will, and it's Jay. I'm just going, the top people in my alliance. Thank you. <br/>Guys, we got to go. <br/>All right, guys. <br/>Bring back food. <br/>I’m fully excited  honestly to go on this journey. I get the feel out the gen-x generation of, oh, we work hard an  we do things the right way. I want the see, what's the right way? <br/>Bye. <br/>I really hope Figgy and  tails don't start making out. Then we'll look like a bunch of idiots, like millennials really  don't know what we're doing because we're letting a power couple stay in the  game. <br/>On the boat, the word "Summit" kept popping up  in my head. For me that's a meeting when different countries come and they  have a g-8 summit. <br/>From the gen-x tribe, CeCe, dave, Paul and myself. Bye, guys. <br/>I’m really excited to go  do this. This is the first time that the gen-x and the millennials are  going to mix together. For my game, making some connections is a good thing. <br/>Pizza and beer. <br/>An old attorney once said to me, you have to look at the  opposition with clear eyes and a cold heart. That's how I’m trying to view this game. So my strategy is to keep my mouth shut and just get  information. <br/>Peanut butter. <br/>Protein. <br/>Break bread with your rivals. It's a temporary truce. Take time for some one-on-one. More friends you could sure use. <br/>I’m a huge "Survivor"  superfan. Being selected to go to a summit like this is fantastic. Cheers, guys. <br/>Cheers. <br/>So far I’m achieving all of my "Survivor"  dreams. Who is missing? Who went home? <br/>Mari. <br/>Jeff: Mari. Did she know it was coming? <br/>No. No. <br/>It's the game. <br/>So got any boyfriends, girls on the tribe, anybody hook up  yet? Anybody headed that way? <br/>Most of us are old and boring. <br/>I’m a lead singer in a  rock band. We do some zz top. I'm old, if you haven't noticed. I play a lot of stuff you guys probably never heard of. <br/>I think the millennials  think a guy like me, because I’m older, and they haven't talked to parents in  a while, and to have their dad sitting there that they can talk to, they  really do appreciate it. <br/>I honestly can say dave  is one of the most incredible guys I ever met. <br/>Oh, back at you. <br/>Talk about a guy that's brutally honest about everything. A bug flies on him and he will scream. I'm surprised you can't hear it at your camp. <br/>Paul wants an audience. He's in a rock 'n' roll band. He gets on stage, and he doesn't ask the audience what they  think, he tells them what he thinks. That's not a guy I would ever imagine myself aligning with. Those are the guys that annoy me. <br/>I’m going right in the  agua. <br/>Right now I’m at the bottom with CeCe and Ken. So I need to find a way to make new friends among the  millennials tribe, because once there is a swap or a merge, I’m going to need  their help to get rid of Paul. <br/>How is Ken doll? <br/>I like Ken. He's the opposite of what you think. He's the most humblest. He's totally not the Ken doll. He's totally opposite. <br/>The boys went in the water. And Taylor an I talked to CeCe and David. We're trying to learn if they're on the outs, if there's any  division in their tribe. <br/>Do you have somebody on the bottom? <br/>We don't think Paul's on the bottom. <br/>Paul's not? <br/>Our tribe, nobody is trying to run around for any idols. <br/>Same here. <br/>There's in boss man? <br/>Well, we do have a couple boss men. One. Paul definitely. <br/>He wears it on his sleeve. You can tell. <br/>Me and dave let Taylor and Figgy know that Paul is the  head person in charge. He's the alpha male. He's the one who is running things in camp. So leaving us alone, that's the stupidest decision they could  have did. It may cost them $1 million. <br/>If I end up on a swap with you or a merge, let's work  together, okay? <br/>Let's do it. <br/>I trust you. <br/>We're so solid with that group. <br/>I will pick off my tribe  if you want me to, okay. I swear to God. I got to have a very, very important 30-second conversation with  Taylor, and I mean it. Come a swap, if it's three millennials and two gen-x, I’m getting  rid of that other gen-x. <br/>Honey, we're home. <br/>Paul, Chris, myself and CeCe came back from the summit. <br/>What was the meeting about? <br/>We met at a real summit. We met at a different beach. <br/>Everybody wanted to know how it was, what happened. <br/>Their tribe went, Jay, Taylor, Figgy and will. <br/>And the thing about talking the Taylor, I felt like I had  a ray of hope that other than finding the idol has been missing for me this  entire game. <br/>All the girls wanted to know about Ken. <br/>Yeah, they did. They was asking about Ken. They said they call you Ken doll. I said, no, Ken is the most hu humble guy you want to me, but  they call you Ken doll. <br/>That's a fun nickname. <br/>You were called that before? <br/>Half my childhood. <br/>Really? <br/>Where's barbie? Ken doll. <br/>You never thought about that. <br/>When you're a boy, the last thing you want to be referred  to as plastic barbie with no penis. The millennials know me as Ken doll and the pretty boy with all  the things that come along with that. But I have the strength of body and the strength of mind to make  it far in this game. <br/>I’m hungry and I want  fish really badly. I'm going to go fish a little bit. The gen-x tribe I think would be hurting if they got rid of me. As far as the challenges go, and my work ethic. <br/>We need food. We need fish. And what I say I do, I wind up doing, 90% of the time. If I say I’m going to do something and I know how to do  something, I do it and it works. Paul is the greatest fisherman, but yet he comes back empty  handed. I would never go into a battle with a leader who was incompetent  or incapable. You pick the person who follows through. You pick the person who does what they say they're going to do. <br/>Coast guard, mr. 40 years in the key, own his own boat, hasn't brought back  anything to us. <br/>Right. <br/>He hasn't brought back one fish, has he? <br/>Not a single one. I would say you and Sunday are probably two of the most humble  people here, and you may have our rock star lead singer, the guy who not only  thinks but acts like he's in charge. Is he out for the tribe or is he out for him? <br/>I know. Obviously you feel like you're on the outs, and I don't want you  to feel that way. <br/>It's just conversations going on. I'm not getting the nod to come. And that sucks. <br/>Ken feels like he's on the outs. I totally understand why he feels that way, because he's not  part of the six. <br/>It seems the only person in this camp that's rubbing  people the wrong way is Paul. <br/>Ken wants to vote out Paul, but I've committed myself to Chris  and Paul and Bret and Sunday and Lucy, who are my best bet moving forward. And day 36, I will then get to read the legacy advantage I found  and then utilize that to my advantage. Found and then utilize that to my advantage. <br/>I can't wait until you  guys, you all will come and visit me in nashville and we're going to have the  time of our lives. <br/>Strategically, the millennial tribe is moving forward and  it's really great for me. Me and figs are pretty good at the moment. My girl's here. She's happy. This couldn't be a better position to be in really. <br/>It's just nice to sit out here. <br/>And not have to worry what's going on out there. <br/>We already got rid of one. Got to get rid of the other two. Zeke is going to be next to go. <br/>He's going to kick our ass at the end. <br/>Got to be Zeke. <br/>Nothing to it. <br/>The status quo of the tribe is not a good position for me. I'm still flabbergasted by that vote because Figgy sucks at  surviving. You can't make an obvious pair that is strong, good-looking,  talented in the challenges and not be a threat in this game, so if Figgy goes  home, there would be a shift, and that's what I need to happen in order to  have some semblance of power here. <br/>If you're Taylor and Figgy, whom do you credit for saving Figgy's  life in that vote? Michelle, right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>If you're Michelle and Jay and you know that Figgy and Taylor  credit you for their lives, you know those two are never going to vote you  out. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>So to me that's helping those four are as tight as can be. If they stick together, they can pick off any of us that they  want, and so all we need to do is vote out figure or Taylor and then this  crew is back in the middle in the power position of this tribe. <br/>I see your point. Adam gives me different things to think about. Even though I’m in the majority. I still don't like Figgy. She's sneaky. I do not trust her. But I’m not making any decisions right now. I'm just watching and thinking and my gut will tell me something  when the time comes. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. Gen-x getting their first look at the new millennial tribe. Mari voted out at the last tribal council. All right. Shall we get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: First things first. Thank you, Bret. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to carry heavy bags over and  under an obstacle and then across the balance beam. You'll then separate the sandbags from the coconuts and use the  sandbags to knock down large puzzle pieces. Once all the pieces are on the ground, you'll then race to  reassemble the puzzle. First to get it right wins immunity, safe from the vote. In addition, you're playing for a reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: It would be nice to have a little comfort. [applause] hammocks, blankets, pillows, candles and two custom Survivor  lounge chairs. Losers go to tribal council where somebody will be the third  person voted out of this game. Take a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. For immunity and reward, Survivors ready? Go! First you got to get five people under and over all these  obstacles with that bag with you. That's a heavy bag. That's 40-plus pounds. <br/>Up and over. Go. Go, go go,. <br/>Gen-xers falling behind. <br/>Come on, Paul. Come on, Paul. <br/>Come on, fig. <br/>Jeff: Millennials are there first. Up on the balance beam. Gen-x is there. Chris will take the balance beam first. Now you have to get across the beam with the bag. The beam is tough enough without 40 pounds. <br/>Good job. <br/>Take your time. <br/>Jeff: Now we're tied. It is now will and Bret. <br/>Ninja focus. <br/>Take it easy. <br/>Jeff: Will drops. Got to go back. Bret drops. Go. It's CeCe now up for gen-x. <br/>Let's go, guys, let's go. <br/>If you can't do it, somebody else from your tribe can. It just means they have to go twice, and you still have to get  across. <br/>Stay calm, fig. Stay calm. You got it. Good girl. <br/>Jeff: Figgy is across. You're good. Here comes Taylor. He's now going the take will's bag. Will still has to get across yourself. CeCe taking a long time on that beam. When she could just let another tribe member take the bag, which  is what the millennials are doing. Taylor across again. Taylor coming back. CeCe is taking forever. It's going to cost her tribe a lot of time. Michaela now out on the beam. <br/>You got it, Michaela. <br/>Jeff: Millennials with a big lead now thanks the a great  strategy. <br/>You got this, Michaela. <br/>Jeff: Michaela is across. You got to go. Lucy now on. Taylor has become a workhorse with the fifth and final bag for  the millennials. The millennials have all their bags. Now they have to get their other two players across. <br/>Will, stay calm. <br/>Jeff: Will struggling to stay on it. <br/>Keep going. You're doing great. <br/>Jeff: Lucy falls. She has to come back. Lucy, you still have to get across the beam. <br/>Go, Paul, go. <br/>She has to get across the beam. <br/>Calm down. <br/>Drop, drop. <br/>Jeff: Will's across. Adam the last millennial to get across. <br/>That's it, Adam. There you go, baby. <br/>That's it, luce. Take you time. <br/>Yeah, buddy. <br/>Jeff: Adam is across. Start separating sand balls from coconuts. Lucy is across. Here comes Paul with his bag. Big lead for the millennials. You have to get your sandbags across. Paul falls. <br/>Let's go, let's go, let's go. <br/>Jeff: You spent a lot of time on that beam and lost a lot  of time. Chris, he's across. You're good. Paul now going across without a bag. Go, Chris. Chris with his third bag. Chris is across. Start separating, gen-x. Jay starting to throw now. Jay is winning in and not getting any love yet. <br/>Yeah, yeah! <br/>Jeff: Jessica, Ken trying the catch up. They lost a lot of time crossing the beam. Big hit by Jay. Now the puzzle starting to come apart. Another hit by Jay. <br/>We're not out of it at all. Go. <br/>Jeff: Gen-x has all their bags. Ken going to start throwing. Ken knocks out a piece. <br/>Go! Go! <br/>Jeff: Ken knocks a few more pieces off. Gen-x starting to catch up now. <br/>Come on. <br/>There you go, Jay. <br/>Jeff: Another nice hit by Jay. And another. Millennials down to two pieces left. Then Zeke and Michelle will take over. <br/>Go, go. <br/>Jeff: Jay knox off the last piece for the millennials. Get all of them here on the mat. Ken with another big hit for gen-x. <br/>Right there. <br/>Jeff: Zeke and Michelle now going the start solving the  puzzle. Gen-x is catching up. They are closing that gap. Ken knocks off two more. <br/>Ed any middle. <br/>Jeff: Michelle and Zeke trying to make sense of these  pieces. <br/>We need one more in the middle. <br/>Jeff: Oh, almost. Ken has one left. Head in. Ken knocks off the last piece. We might have a challenge after all. <br/>Come on, you guys got this. <br/>Jeff: It's Michelle and Zeke, Sunday and David. <br/>Start with the bottom pieces. <br/>They got it. <br/>Jeff: You've been staring at this puzzle during the entire  challenge. Now you have to reassemble it. <br/>Other side, other side. <br/>Jeff: Millennials still with a lead. They have had the lead from the beginning. <br/>Iguana on the left. <br/>Jeff: First to solve it wins immunity and reward. Losers back the tribal council. <br/>No one is going home tonight. <br/>Zeke, back corner, back corner. <br/>Jeff: Millennials getting a lot of help from the bench. <br/>That's it. You're right, you're right. <br/>Don't mess him up. <br/>Shut up. <br/>There you go. <br/>Jeff: Another piece by millennials. <br/>The iguana. <br/>Jeff: Another piece by gen-x. Millennials with another piece. <br/>Come on, Sunday! <br/>Yes, yes, yes, yes. <br/>Jeff: Do they have it? Yes! Millennials win immunity and reward. <br/>Just couldn't catch 'em. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Millennials, congratulations. <br/>Yes. [applause]  Jeff: Nobody going home from the millennial tribe. In addition, nice reward. <br/>Question, Jeff. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Can I switch comfort for fishing gear, please? Let me go fishing. <br/>Jeff: Here's the only way this will work, a, if gen-x  agreed to it, and, b, if the terms of what the trade were, because I’m not  sure this is enough for fishing gear, were all agreed to, but I’m totally  open to having this discussion. <br/>What do you think? <br/>. <br/>Jeff: It's pretty simple. You can say no? <br/>As much as I enjoy catching octopus and yellow tail and  grouper and everything else, we as a group decided that they can keep the  chairs and the comfort. <br/>Jeff: All right. Millennials, grab your reward, head back the head back to camp,  enjoy the night off. <br/>They said no. If they were our parents, they would have said yes, but we're  already beating them, so they don't want the make us stronger. That makes sense. <br/>Jeff: Gen-x, somebody from your train will be the third  person voted out of this game. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>CeCe, she wanted that personal victory of inching across  the balance beam. Three and a half millennials got across in that amount of time. It was a difference maker. At tribal council, I’m not sure how CeCe doesn't go home  tonight. Âª  Everybody fought. <br/>So we move forward, right? <br/>In my opinion, CeCe cost us the challenge. There was no question who was going home after that. <br/>All right. Will rest figure out what we're doing. <br/>But it's "Survivor," and I've seen it happen  before, when you get too complacent, things happen. But I think everybody is on board with voting out CeCe  unanimously. <br/>She can't do these challenges. Enough is enough. <br/>Three and a half out of five people crossed on her. <br/>I know. <br/>That's huge. <br/>Watching it...  It was painful. <br/>So we're all agreeing, right, who is going home? <br/>Yeah. <br/>All right. All right. <br/>I went to the well with Chris  and Bret. We basically talked about sticking to our alliance of six some  what we have on the docket for tonight is to vote out CeCe. <br/>We have to keep the team strong. <br/>I’m sorry. <br/>Voting CeCe out to keep the strong is a good thing to do. She has not done well in challenges. I can't argue it at all. <br/>So it's time. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Do you girls have any idea what the plan is? Don't know what's going on. I'm clueless. <br/>I think the boys are  working out the details. <br/>I’m worried about tonight  because I had three votes last time, and, of course, no one ever comes up to  me and says, hey, let's do this. Paul never comes up to me. Bret, Chris, Sunday, Jessica and Lucy, they never come up to me. I'm 100% worried about that. <br/>Ken, what do you think about us trying to put a target on Paul? CeCe, we're already on the bottom, I don't think we have  anything to lose. <br/>We have to get rid of Paul. As soon as Paul goes away, then some other connections and bonds  can start forming. <br/>There's CeCe, myself and Ken on the bottom. I already retrieved my idol from its hiding spot, but other  people could absolutely take control of the game if they wanted to and vote  off Paul. That's all we need. I wish they could see. There's just no point of keeping Paul on their side. <br/>It seems to easy not to just hold and stay the course,  right? So we have the same people in mind, right? We have CeCe and we go down the line? <br/>Yep. <br/>And we just placate everybody in the meantime. <br/>Of courseful. <br/>As long as you guys don't do a boy thing. <br/>Oh, no, you have my word, if they came up, I would tell  you. If they decided to do that, I would say, ladies, you're on your  own. <br/>Paul said to me that if the boys came in and said they  wanted to do an all-boys thing, I'd say good luck, girl. I went, what? I knew that he was not down with me. We're on the bottom as far as the six. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's the boys against the girls. <br/>I feel like he's a bigger  threat. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I’m comfortable with it. <br/>I don't know. You think dave would be on board with that? <br/>We'd need Ken, CeCe and dave. <br/>I’m sure CeCe, Ken and  dave would vote off Paul, so tonight we have a very big decision to make. If we determine that voting off Paul will be the best thing for  our tribe, I am going to be hurting two individuals that I've worked with, Bret  and Chris. <br/>We're good, right? <br/>Yeah. We're 100%. <br/>All the women are over there. <br/>They're fine. <br/>All right. <br/>Oh, God. This is so hard. <br/>I’m fearful of what will  happen if we don't vote off Paul, but I’m fearful of what will happen if we  do vote off Paul. <br/>Jeff: David, let's talk about the summit. Who went from your group? <br/>It was myself, Chris, Paul, and CeCe. <br/>Jeff: So you mixed tribes. You meet each other. What was your takeaway? <br/>The thing that did strike me as odd is I saw the  millennials as people and peers. It was a mutual respect between all of us, and I’m feeling like  transformed in some way. <br/>Jeff: What is it that's changed, David? Because you were very nervous at the first tribal, and you do  see much more calm. What's happened? <br/>This experience actually is helping me cope with my  anxiety, so it's not that I feel like I’m any safer in the game right now. It's just like tearing down the walls and energy I have for the  anxiety, so it makes me more calm. <br/>Jeff: CeCe, you were always very nervous. Turned out rightly so. You got votes. <br/>I got three votes. I didn't feel safe. No one was talking to me. No one was giving me a straight answer. And I still feel the same way today. There's three people at the bottom and everyone else is at the  top. <br/>Jeff: Who is at the bottom? <br/>I think myself, dave and possibly  Ken. <br/>Jeff: Chris, if there is an alliance of six, how do you  navigate keeping everybody together when there is an opportunity to go be CeCe  and David and Ken and say, let's make something else happen because I think I  might be number five? <br/>Way too early to be making those assumptions. If you're going to try to stick to an alliance, it's very  dangerous to start making those assumptions who is five and six right now,  way too early. <br/>Jeff: Let's talk about the challenge today. Just generally speaking, CeCe, did you feel good about getting  over the balance beam? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: And it was very impressive that you finished. Took a long time. What you guys didn't see were the millennials who moved across  that balance beam quickly because they cooperated. Bret, watching you guys, it looked like a lot of individuals. <br/>I think that might be  some truth to that. I mean, is it because of pride that we had, could be. I don't know. <br/>Jeff: Sunday, do you think there's something to that? Because I was blown away by how efficiently the millennials  worked together to figure it out. <br/>Right, for gen-xers, we think of everything in terms of  it's the right way or the wrong way. It's not necessarily right or wrong, but you may get there a different  path. I feel like my kids that are millennials, they'll give anything  a try. They'll try it with anybody and they'll try it 80 different  ways. <br/>Jeff: I have a question, just curiosity. Paul, do you text? <br/>No. A little bit. <br/>Jeff: Sunday, do you text? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Jeff: When you write the word you, as is in see you later,  do you spell y-o-u, or do you use the letter "U"? <br/>I write y-o-u. <br/>Jeff: Interesting because the millennials will tell you  the language is changing and you can change with us. But it's more efficiency. <br/>There's something about efficiency but there is something  poetic about language. You lose that foundation of language that we have, we lose  something really beautiful. Let's be efficient, but don't lose sight of the past. <br/>Jeff: But Ken, how far away is that comment from being the  guy that says, vinyl is the only way the listen the music. [laughter]  There is something about vinyl over digital that I dig. I like vinyl. <br/>Jeff: So before we go to the vote, what's the level of  paranoia right now, Paul? <br/>I think the level of  paranoia within the six is low, and I think the level of paranoia for the  three is high. But people that are sitting in the six made those other moves to  get them in that six. And I have just as much of a chance to be sitting there as they  do. I'm sure I'll be sitting there one day, and I won't feel good  about it either. That's why we're here. We're not here to go camping. We're here to play the game. <br/>Jeff: Ken, could you feel that level of paranoia as one of  the three. <br/>I think some people  definitely feel more comfortable than others, but for me it comes down to my  work ethic. I want to be abasset. I feel like it's helping, but I can be needed. <br/>Jeff: CeCe, what odds do you give yourself right now? <br/>10%. <br/>Jeff: Really? Jessica, what do you think the result will be? <br/>I’m hoping the results  help this tribe move forward as a tribe. I understand there are divisions, but we also need to focus on  winning the next challenge, and that's not going to take the sixeof us. It's going the take everyone who is left. <br/>Jeff: Okay. It is time to vote. Bret, you're up. Bret, you're up. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  if anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote Paul. CeCe. Paul. CeCe. Two votes Paul, two votes CeCe. Paul. That's three votes Paul. CeCe. We're tied again. Three votes Paul, three votes CeCe. Paul. That's four votes Paul, three votes CeCe. Third person voted out, Paul. That's five, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Paul, the tribe has spoKen. Time for you to go. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Jeff: Well, whether you're a mill millennial or a gen-xer,  blind side is a blind side. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. "Survivor," tensions are high at the gen-x tribe. <br/>Don't talk to anybody else. <br/>We went from one dictator to another. <br/>Jeff: But the real battle is against the millennials. <br/>Their guys are huge. <br/>Jeff: Taylor takes her top off. <br/>You're about to see some ta-tas today. <br/>Wow. <br/>Blind sided 150%. Apparently somebody played better than I did. And I’m still kind of in shock. I'm trying to figure out who voted for me and what happened. When I got six, it was pretty scary, but "Survivor"  has been a great experience for me. At 52 years of age, I've been throw a lot in my life, and I would  say this rates up there with number one.
