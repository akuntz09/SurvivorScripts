It Makes You Strong! <br/>Ah! <br/>Jeff Probst: Previously  Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor... on Survivor... The tribes were mixed  up. <br/>"Fei Long, choose the two warriors from Zhan Hu who you feel can best  help to strengthen your tribe."  Jeff: Sherea and Frosti had to move to the Fei Long tribe. <br/>Hey, guys! <br/>Hey, guys! <br/>Hello! <br/>Jeff: Aaron and James had to move to the Zhan Hu tribe. <br/>What's going on, guys? <br/>Jeff: At the new Fei Long, Sharea and Frosti were outnumbered. <br/>This is a dangerous place for me. Things are really messed up now. <br/>Jeff: But they quickly noticed that Jean-Robert was on the outs. <br/>I know. <br/>That just makes me so much more comfortable knowing that there's somebody  here they already have problems with. <br/>Jeff: Meanwhile, Todd continued the search for the hidden immunity idol. <br/>"Waste no more time searching the ground."  Right now, I'm kind of wandering around the camp, like, with my head in the  sky. <br/>Jeff: At the new Zhan Hu, Jaime and Peih-Gee hatched a plan to lose immunity  challenges plan to lose immunity challenges on purpose. on purpose. <br/>Jeff: And at the immunity challenge, Jaime tossed away a puzzle piece...  They have to fit on, y'all. They have to fit on like this. <br/>Jeff: ...barely disguising her effort to throw the challenge. Fei Long wins immunity! At tribal council, the plan was uncovered. So you threw the challenge. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Jeff: And Aaron was voted out... Fifth person voted out of Survivor:  China,Aaron. ...leaving James on the Zhan Hu chopping block. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK  TELEVISION TELEVISION TELEVISION  Good morning, James. <br/>Good morning, James. <br/>I definitely feel confident about throwing the challenge and getting Aaron  off the game. He was one of the most powerful players, and suddenly we had full control of  him, and we still have that over James. If we throw the next immunity challenge, James is going to be gone. Best possible scenario, we merge at that point. And if that happens, we'll be able to reconnect with Frosti and Sherea, still...  if they're still on the same page with us. <br/>Aaron's gone. And I'm just at their mercy right now. The best thing for me to do is to keep them rested so in competitions,  there's no excuse of anybody being tired. It makes me look good in the long run. They're going to keep me around. So I'm trying to deal with it and make it work. Because if they throw another Because if they throw another challenge, I'm  gone. challenge, I'm gone. challenge, I'm gone. [ snoring] [ snoring]  I have to tell you something. It has to stay between us. There's a hidden immunity idol here at our camp. When we kidnap people, they give us clues. And I've gotten them all. And I wasn't going to tell you until I found it, but I haven't found it yet. found it yet. I have three clues. I have three clues. <br/>Todd approached me and he told me that he had three clues to the immunity  idol, which I was kind of shocked because I didn't know about any hidden  immunity idol. So we're going to do everything we can to find that idol today. we can to find that idol today. We have to. We have to. <br/>If we win reward today, we are bringing over either Aaron or James, whoever  is left, because they're going to give us a clue as to where that hidden  immunity idol is, and Amanda and I will have control in this I will have  control in this game. game. game. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! Fei Long getting your first look at the new Zhan Hu. Aaron voted out at the last Aaron voted out at the last tribal council. tribal council. You guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, one person from each tribe will race through  this abandoned Chinese village to find a tribe[1]colored  puzzle board. You'll untie it, bring it back to your mat, the next person goes. Once you've collected all eight boards, you'll use them to decode a phrase  made famous by Confucius. First tribe to solve it correctly wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: The winning tribe will be taken to a nearby island that is home to a  tea house. You'll have access to a bath, shower, chance to get clean, plenty of soap,  towels. You will have two Western toilets, something you haven't had in a while. had in a while. Plenty of Charmin, ultra-strong. Plenty of Charmin, ultra-strong. And because it's a tea house, you'll have some tea and a light snack. In addition, the winning tribe will kidnap one person from the losing tribe. That person will stay with them until the next immunity challenge. Big enough stakes? <br/>Love it. <br/>Jeff: Fei Long, you have three extra members. You're sitting three people out. Keeping in mind you cannot sit out the same people in back-to[1]back  challenges, who are the three people sitting out? Denise, Amanda, Courtney, sitting this one out. I'll give everybody else a minute to strategize and we'll get started. Here we go, for reward. Survivors ready? Go. James and Jean-Robert moving from room to room. <br/>What in the world? <br/>Jeff: Got to get the planks untied and race back before the next person can  go. next person can go. <br/>Come on, Jean-Robert! <br/>Come on, Jean-Robert! <br/>Jeff: Jean-Robert first back with a plank for Fei Long. Sherea heading out. James back with a plank for Zhan Hu. Peih-Gee heading out. <br/>Come on, Sherea! <br/>That's mine. <br/>Sorry. <br/>Sorry. <br/>Concentrate, Sherea. <br/>Concentrate, Sherea. <br/>Come on, Peih-Gee, you've got it girl! <br/>Pull that out, let's go! Way to go, yeah! <br/>Jeff: Sherea has her plank. She's heading back. Todd out for Fei Long. <br/>Come on, Todd! <br/>All right, Peih-Gee. You got this. <br/>Come on, Peih-Gee. <br/>Jeff: Peih-Gee back with another plank. Erik out for Zhan Hu. <br/>Come on, Todd! <br/>Charmin time!

We are tied, seven planks each. Each tribe has one plank left before they can start working on the puzzle. Frosti back with the eighth and final plank for Fei Long. They start working on their puzzle. It is a phrase made famous by Confucius. Confucius. <br/>Come on, James! <br/>Come on, James! <br/>Jeff: Zhan Hu patiently waiting on James to get back. Here he comes. Go, Zhan Hu! Zhan Hu, trying to catch up. <br/>Right there. <br/>Jeff: Fei Long working on their puzzle. Nice reward on the line, and the kidnapping of a tribe member from the other  tribe. Frosti getting excited. He thinks he's on to something. Fei Long thinks they have something. Trying to figure out what it is. <br/>Where's the O? Where's the one with the O on it? <br/>Jeff: Zhan Hu making no progress, once again having a very difficult time  with the puzzle part of a challenge. <br/>Tell me when. <br/>Tell me when. I can't see. I can't see. <br/>Is that right? <br/>We've got it. <br/>Jeff: "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."  single step." Fei Long wins reward! Fei Long wins reward! All right, first order of business: Fei Long, you are kidnapping one member  from Zhan Hu. They will stay with you until the next immunity challenge, which means they  will participate in this reward with you. Who you getting? <br/>Bring him back, baby. <br/>Come back, James. Come on home. Come home for a night, son. Haven't seen you smile like that in a minute. <br/>Jeff: Zhan Hu, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to Grab your stuff, head back to camp. camp. James, this is for you. It says "open in private." That's what it means. Even though are you friendly with these guys. Fei Long, congratulations. This is yours, and you are heading to your reward. A boat is waiting for you. A boat is waiting for you. Get your stuff, head on out. Get your stuff, head on out. <br/>When Jeff announced what the reward was at the challenge, there was  excitement on the team. We're going to go to a tea house and some refreshment. That's what he said, "Tea house, some refreshment and showers." But  when we got to this place, it was like a little sweet spot in the middle of  nowhere. The view was amazing. I mean, everybody on the tribe was just so happy. <br/>Hello. <br/>Hello. <br/>Hello. <br/>Welcome to the Charmin Tea House. <br/>Come in and have some tea. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Wow! <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>No! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Oh, my gosh, sugar! <br/>They sit us down and they give us tea, and then they bring out little snacks,  and we're all so happy to be there. Oh! It was so good! <br/>Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! <br/>Okay. <br/>Yeah! What a great challenge to win. This is ridiculous. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Oh, my god, you have a brush! <br/>This is so nice! <br/>Isn't it, though? <br/>For real. This is the best reward. <br/>I'd like my watermelon in the tub, please. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Oh, this is the best day ever. <br/>I won't lie to you, Frosti and James. That tub looks the most attractive to jump into right now. That tub right there. <br/>I am so happy right now. <br/>I tried my best to be as far away from Jean-Robert in the bathtub as could  possibly happen in that place. He had the one on the far end, I took the one on the other far end. He's kind of gross. Every single part of me wants to see Jean-Robert go. I just don't like him. I just don't like him. He's a horrible person. He's a horrible person. <br/>Oh, there we go! We've got some butt action happening! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah, James! <br/>Don't tease me, James! <br/>Don't tease me, James! Don't tease me! Don't tease me! <br/>James has such a nice butt. He was in the shower, lathering up. He's stripping down, and none of us cared. He has a nice butt. I mean, he might as well show it off. off. <br/>Why y'all messing with me? <br/>Why y'all messing with me? <br/>I'll speak for myself. <br/>I'll speak for myself. I'm tired of losing. I'm tired of losing. <br/>We're so into keeping Sherea Frosti, Erik, Peih-Gee and I together. We thought we would do anything to save them-- we'd throw a challenge to save  them. We did it, you know? But Frosti won't make eye contact with us. We don't know if he's changed his mind and switched over with them. You know, everything's just unknown, so it's really hard to deal with,  especially when there's just three of us here and there's so many over there. <br/>Now I'm not sure about Frosti and Sherea, because that flips and Sherea,  because that flips everything. everything. <br/>I mean, we have three right here, three strong. That's great. That's great. <br/>But it's not enough. <br/>But it's not enough. <br/>This the best reward yet. <br/>It's so nice to clean my feet. This is the life. <br/>You know, sometimes throughout this game, I feel like I am the only one  playing. So I knew right away when we kidnapped James that I would kidnapped James  that I would approach him. approach him. <br/>"In this sealed tube is a clue to the hidden immunity idol. You must give this to a member of this tribe before you rejoin your  own." Cool. I hope it's worth it. I need something to save me. I'm in a bad spot right now. Todd is the cornerstone to all the alliances on this tribe, so I'm going to  roll with Todd and roll the old dice and maybe it will come up right. If not, I'm pretty much gone If not, I'm pretty much gone anyway, so I have  to do it. anyway, so I have to do it. <br/>"There are four that surround it, and four much the same. The one etched finer could salvage the game." I know what they're  talking about. It's those stupid bats above the It's those stupid bats above the freakin'  thing. freakin' thing. <br/>I went over where we thought the idol would be, and I was just hitting off  shingles so people didn't know what I was doing. And then Todd comes over... And then Todd comes over...  Knock those down. <br/>Knock those down. <br/>He gets up there, and he  He gets up there, and he starts pulling on the thing. starts pulling on the thing. <br/>All of a sudden, Frosti comes running over and climbs up, so I go into panic  mode of, "He's going to find out. He's going to see this!" And Amanda's like, "Get down, Frosti, get  down, Frosti," Frosti, get down, Frosti," because she knows about  it. because she knows about it. And I'm telling him to get down, And I'm telling him to get down, and I  started panicking, and... and I started panicking, and... Hey, hey, hey! Wait, wait, wait! <br/>What? <br/>All I could think was Frosti,  All I could think was Frosti, Frosti, no! Frosti, no! <br/>This has to be the worst way in history of getting an immunity idol. Like, honestly, in front of everybody, Todd's yelling. He's so impatient. I knew something like that was I knew something like that was going to happen. going to happen. <br/>Being there when they got the idol cements my place in their little group. I'm there for sure. Frosti's in. Frosti's in. In! In! <br/>James came down. I gave him the idol, and I told him what needs to happen. This is it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You've just got to lose the  You've just got to lose the game. game. <br/>So if James takes that idol, loses immunity, they vote for him, but he uses  the idol to get rid of Jaime, we sever the tie between her and Erik. Hopefully, at ten we'll merge, and we'll still have our numbers to go strong  into the merge. Now, here's the way it works. Everybody votes. You stand up and say, "Jeff, I have the hidden immunity idol." All  of your votes are immune. The person you vote for is gone. <br/>Cool. <br/>You can make that Jaime. <br/>I cannot stop smiling. And it's all good, because I'm not going anywhere. I have the immunity idol. It's all good, baby. <br/>I don't know if the clues are the same as theirs, but they might be. The second you get to camp, their camp, you run up and you grab it off. <br/>Cool. I was going to do that anyway. <br/>But do it without them noticing. <br/>I'm the only one with real access to the other immunity idol at the other  tribe. So now all I have to do is stay focused, keep my head in the game, lose the  immunity challenge, get the other idol. Now I have both of them. I mean, it's going to be wonderful. I'm having a great time. I'm having a great time. <br/>This saved our asses. <br/>This saved our asses. <br/>Jaime, all right. <br/>Do you know how? I found the hidden immunity idol. <br/>You found it? <br/>I gave it to James for them to lose and get rid of Jaime. So we still have our numbers. <br/>How did you find it? <br/>See that empty square up there? <br/>No way, just right there in front of everybody. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay. <br/>James knows to throw the challenge. <br/>I can't believe it. Here it was sitting right in front of us at camp the whole darn time. <br/>So I will be doing my best, as I always give 110%, because that's the only  way I know how to go. <br/>Me telling Courtney and Denise about the hidden immunity idol helped them  realize that they had to try harder for immunity today, especially if they're  fighting to lose, which we don't even know is the case. <br/>Over at Zhan Hu, I'm pretty much a dead man walking. But now I have the upper hand. They think they're safe-- wrong. They think they're safe-- wrong. I'll be able to get them. I'll be able to get them. I'll be able to get them. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! So James, time to head back to your tribe, Zhan Hu. <br/>Jeff: All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? First things first, Todd. First things first, Todd. Take back immunity. Take back immunity. Once again, immunity back up for grabs. Today's challenge will be a food-eating competition. You're going to eat traditional Chinese dishes that are anything but pleasant. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Oh, gross. <br/>One at a time, players from each tribe will step up and square off. The first person to get their food down scores a point for their tribe. The first tribe to four wins immunity, safe in this game. Make sense? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Jeff: Fei Long, you have three extra members. You're sitting three people out. You cannot sit the same people out in back-to-back challenges. Courtney, Amanda, and Denise sat out in the last challenge. You are playing in this challenge. You need one more member to join them. <br/>That's going to be Frosti. <br/>Jeff: Frosti. Everybody else take a spot on the bench. We'll get started. First two come up. Frosti taking on Peih-Gee. <br/>Come on, Frosti. You own this. <br/>Jeff: Chinese name for this, ghi ching. You know what that is? <br/>No. <br/>Jeff: Chicken hearts. <br/>Oh, yeah. You own this! <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Jeff: Ten each. Got to get all ten down. Survivors ready? Go. Peih-Gee shoving them down. Frosti shoving them down. <br/>Swallow them, Peih-Gee. <br/>Oh, Frosti, don't enjoy them, swallow them. <br/>Swallow, Peih-Gee, swallow. <br/>That's it, Frosti, good job. <br/>Jeff: Frosti making quick work of the chicken hearts. He's got to get them down now. <br/>Oh, that's beautiful. <br/>Jeff: He's licking the plate. <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>What? <br/>Jeff: For emphasis. Fei Long scores. Fei Long leads, one-zip. Next two, Jaime and Courtney. Nizhois the Chinese name for this. You guys got off easy-- eel. <br/>Oh, cool. <br/>Jeff: Three pieces of eel Got to get all of it down, including the heads. Fei Long leads one-zip for immunity. Survivors ready? Go. <br/>Come on, Jaime. <br/>Good job, Courtney. <br/>Jeff: Courtney and Jaime both attacking the eel. Probably the best food you've had in 18 days. Jaime not messing around. She's already on her second piece of eel. Courtney still working on the first. Jaime working on her third piece of eel. <br/>Come on, Courtney. <br/>Jeff: Jaime finishing up her third piece of eel. Courtney catching up. Courtney now done with her second piece of eel. <br/>There's the puking, there's the gagging. There it comes. Here it comes. <br/>Go, Courtney. <br/>Go, Courtney. Swallow it, swallow it, Courtney. Keep going. <br/>Jeff: Jamie on her last bit. Courtney trying to shove the last of her eel down. Jaime has it. Zhan Hu scores. We're tied one-one. Next two, come up. <br/>Do this, Amanda. <br/>All right, Erik, you're hungry. <br/>Jeff: Jhing zeng weiis the name of this dish. Baby turtles. <br/>Oh, my god. We have to eat the shell and everything? <br/>Jeff: Three each. We're tied one-one for immunity. Survivors ready? Go. Amanda throws the first two in her mouth. Erik working one at a time. <br/>Wow, Amanda! You're a champion, Amanda! <br/>Swallow, swallow, swallow, swallow, swallow. <br/>Jeff: Erik and Amanda both have all three in their mouths. Just got to get them down. Show me an empty mouth. <br/>Swallow, Amanda! Swallow, swallow, swallow, Amanda. Swallow, Amanda! Swallow it! <br/>Jeff: Erik has it. Zhan Hu leads two-one. Playing to four. Next two. Denise and James. Chinese name for this, mau dje don. Balut is the name we call it. These are chicken fetuses. <br/>Come on, Denise. You can do this. <br/>Jeff: You each have two. They've been weighed. It is equal portions. They still have the feathers on them, so be careful of that when they go down. Zhan Hu leads two-one. Playing to four. Survivors ready? Go. <br/>Ah! <br/>Jeff: James spitting it back up. <br/>Come on, James. It's a cheeseburger. Oh, it's a sandwich. <br/>Get in my mouth! Ah! Get in there. Aaggh! <br/>Jeff: Denise takes a big chunk of feathers. James struggling. <br/>James, you're going to let Denise show you up? <br/>Jeff: James spitting it back up into his bowl. <br/>Over in two seconds. <br/>Just swallow it, Denise. You got this, own it! <br/>Jeff: Denise, you're struggling. Mind over matter. <br/>That's the way, Denise. Denise puts it down, and it comes right back up. <br/>Oh, Denise, you've got him. <br/>Denise, you've got him. He's gagging on it, Denise. <br/>Oh, yeah, he's full from breakfast. <br/>Are you giving up, James? Give me a break. You going to let Denise beat you.? <br/>You've got this James. <br/>Put it in your mouth, hold your nose, chew and swallow. <br/>Yeah, hold your nose, James. <br/>Sorry, James. <br/>Jeff: Denise, you giving up? <br/>No way Denise is giving up. <br/>No way Denise is giving up. <br/>Denise, come on. <br/>Denise, come on. <br/>I got it. <br/>Oh, god. <br/>Chew it. <br/>Jeff: James puts it all in his mouth. <br/>Come on, man. <br/>Jeff: James scores for Zhan Hu. Zhan Hu leads 3-1. <br/>You are the man! Give him some water. Good job, Denise. <br/>Jeff: Next two, come up. Frosti coming up for Fei Long. Erik coming back for Zhan Hu. Everybody's gone once. We're on the second round. Pei dhongis the name. Thousand-year-old egg. Put a little clay around them, some ash to keep them preserved. I promise you this will not be the best thing you've ever eaten, and it will  rival anything you've tried before. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Here's where we stand. Zhan Hu leads three-one. Frosti, if you do not win this point, Zhan Hu wins immunity. Eric, win this point, you win immunity for Zhan Hu. Survivors ready. Go. Frosti is not messing around at all. Get it all in there. <br/>Come on, Frost. Erik's got it for Zhan Hu. Erik's got it for Zhan Hu. Zhan Hu wins immunity. Zhan Hu wins immunity. <br/>Good job, Frost. Zhan Hu, congratulations. No tribal council tonight, nobody going home. <br/>Yes! <br/>Finally. <br/>Jeff: Fei Long, tribal council tonight where one of the seven of you will be  going home. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I'll see you at tribal. I'll see you at tribal. <br/>See you, guys. <br/>See you, guys. <br/>Heads up high, guys, because we played well. Denise, you got brutalized. That was, like... obviously, that was the toughest one. <br/>I just feel bad, though, you know. I'm sorry. I let my teammates down today. James tried to eat that balut as slow as he possibly could so that I could  keep up with him. But unfortunately, I just could not get that down my throat, so we ended up  on the losing end. <br/>Perfect plan, genius idea, smashed. And so we're trying to look on the positive side and say, "Hey, we  lost." We still get rid of one of the old Zhan Hu, and we still have old  Zhan Hu, and we still have our numbers. our numbers. Courtney's on our side for sure. I'm positive, almost positive James is on our side. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Because he did try to throw that. And I don't think he has anything going on with the new guys. <br/>No, I don't think so. I think he's... seriously, I think he's with us. <br/>He's with us. <br/>I really do think he's with us. <br/>We've got five right there. And I'm almost 100% positive that Frosti will stay. Right now we need him to trust us and this tonight will help him trust us. Does that make sense? Because we want to trust him just as much as he wants to trust us. <br/>I'm also coming to get water. <br/>Oh, good. So Sherea is gone tonight. So Sherea is gone tonight. <br/>Right. <br/>Right. <br/>All right, so we're in agreement for Sherea tonight, huh? <br/>Yeah. <br/>So after Todd's and Amanda's plans went awry, they're like, "Okay, well,  no question about it, we're voting off Sherea, okay?" Sherea, Sherea,  Sherea. And I'm like, "Yeah, okay, whatever." But when I thought about for  a little while, I actually like Sharea. And if it came down to it of who I thought would vote me out quicker, I  definitely think that she would keep me around longer she would keep me  around longer than Jean-Robert. than Jean-Robert. <br/>Well, right now, the people at Fei Long want me to go home. What they don't understand is they need to be scared of the people in their  tribe, too. You know, as far as Jean-Robert, he'll vote any of them out. So the same time they're looking at me, they need to be scared of each other. each other. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. <br/>You know, everybody's name gets on the list eventually. I mean, I hate doing it, I really do, because I like her a lot. I hate it. <br/>I do, too. <br/>Obviously, I'd rather it be her than me, and I think it's a her than me, and  I think it's a smarter move. smarter move. <br/>Do you know what I mean? <br/>It's the smarter idea right now to stick with more of our tribe. And honestly, it has to be And honestly, it has to be Frosti or Sharea. Frosti or Sharea. <br/>Do you know what I mean? <br/>No, I totally understand. <br/>Eventually, it will be down to like, our people, you know? But right now, it's not. And we have to look at the bigger picture of things. <br/>The thing is, it's like, our great plan didn't work today either. Do you know what I mean? <br/>There's only so much planning we can do at, like, every stage. Like, you can't predict what's Like, you can't predict what's going to happen. going to happen. <br/>I like to trust my gut and my vibe, and so far, I've really felt comfortable  about my position in the game. All of a sudden, something doesn't feel 100% to me. The plan was either Sherea or Frosti, most likely Sherea. But I've got to tell you, I'm But I've got to tell you, I'm uneasy right now. uneasy right now. <br/>I feel like we should vote out Jean-Robert tonight. Do you know what's happening now? We are lining ourselves up as power players. They will get rid of us if we don't start doing what people want. Because Jean-Robert is not stupid, and he will turn on us. He will. <br/>Sharea will too. Todd, I don't know. I think Jean-Robert definitely has to go. I don't think now is the time, honestly. <br/>I don't know what to do. <br/>Honestly, my gut feeling is that...  My gut's saying Jean-Robert. <br/>So I guess it comes down to who we feel we can trust more at this point--  Jean-Robert or Sherea. Sherea. <br/>I... this sucks. <br/>I... this sucks. <br/>Jeff: Well, when you're winning, it's easy to get along. You start to lose, things change. Sherea, what did you sense when you guys got back today after losing? <br/>I sense a lot of shadiness today. You know, people talking like, "Let's talk here. Okay, now let's talk. Let me go talk. I'll be back." That's how it's running over here, you know? <br/>Jeff: Jean-Robert, does the game continue to change day to day, and does that  then affect the way you play it? <br/>I'll tell you what-- it's day 18, Jeff, and I'm a changed person. I mean, I find myself doing a little cooking, a little fire. And it's routine now. It's not even chores. <br/>Did you ask him all that? Wow. Somebody along the way told him that he had something important to say,  because he does a lot of talking, always running his mouth, story after story. <br/>What do you say to that? <br/>You don't say anything. That's why you don't say anything to me, because you know you don't want me  to say anything back to you. You talk to the people who aren't going to say anything to you. Little do you know, they don't like you. <br/>Jeff: Would that surprise you, Jean-Robert, if you found out that the people  on the tribe didn't like you? <br/>I'm certain that some of the people do not like me. I'm a bad boy. Sometimes that happens. But, you know, even as a bad boy, and being aggressive, I like the way I'm  playing this game, and I think I'm doing just fine. <br/>Jeff: Courtney, the look on your face, very smug. <br/>Bad boy? Not quite the term I would have perhaps selected. But it's always interesting to hear people talk about themselves and, really,  "Bad boy, bad boy," because you play poker or something? Do you have a Harley I don't know about? <br/>Jeff: Would a Harley make Jean-Robert a bad boy? <br/>Well, I mean, bad boy... who do you think you are, Luke Perry? <br/>Jeff: How would you describe Jean-Robert, Courtney? <br/>I mean, we don't get along. We don't like each other. I think he walks around, he talks a lot, jokes that aren't funny, lot of  judgments of other people, a lot of self[1]righteousness. You know, I think, like, that kind of stuff is, like... he's just a crappy  person. And, yeah, I'm going to laugh at him when he's like, "I'm a bad boy,  but, you know, I go out and get some fish." Like, it's just funny, just  as an observer and to being like sort of the outsider of my tribe. Like, I know we have two members of another tribe that have joined us, but I  think I was on the outs before they got here. <br/>See, that kinds of hurts, though, because I love you, and I've love you since  day three, is what I say, because day one and two I didn't really like you. <br/>But...  I love you, and we get along so well. <br/>I love you guys, too, but it's also... you know, it's a really cliquey tribe. <br/>And I click well with you is how I felt. And so, like, for you to say that you're on the outskirts and that you're not  close to me is a little bit of, like, rubbing salt in the wounds. <br/>But...  I guess that's just how it is, though. <br/>I got to tell you, Jeff, even with this infighting going on, and this is a  place to air out dirty laundry, when it comes to the challenges and coming  together, I think we really do work well together as a team. And to be honest with you, we're in a good spot. I like where we're at. <br/>Jeff: On that note, it is time to vote. time to vote. Denise, you're up. Denise, you're up. <br/>It's unfortunate we didn't get a chance to know each other get a chance to  know each other a little better. a little better. <br/>Somebody along the way told you you were hot. I'm going to bust that big bubble you call a mouth and tell bubble you call a  mouth and tell you you're not. you you're not. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the  Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. votes.

They'll realize it sooner or later, and I hope half of them get screwed,  since some of them screwed me. But, you know, they knew they couldn't beat me in the challenges. I was the strong one, they were the weak ones. So of course they're going to So of course they're going to take out the  threat.
