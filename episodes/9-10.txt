<br/> <br/>Jeff Probst: Previously, on Survivor:  <br/>( laughs ): We shocked the shiznit out of them.  <br/>Probst: The men swallowed their pride after they were  deceived, when the women's alliance rejoined forces and voted off Rory.  <br/>It's gonna be tough to survive the rest of this  game.  <br/>No way!  <br/>Probst: And the tribe got a new pet.  <br/>Chris! Oh, my God!  <br/>Here, pig, pig, pig, pig...  <br/>No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't eat him.  <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge... Eliza out of the  game.  <br/>Shows you just where you are, doesn't it, boys?  <br/>Probst: Politics and trivia helped Leann come out on top.  Leann wins reward.  <br/>I won something!  <br/>Probst: She chose Julie to join her.  <br/>Can you believe we said that? ( laughter ) Oh, my  God.  <br/>Probst: The girls then shared a picnic on the rim of a  dormant volcano.  <br/>Hello.  <br/>Oh, wow.  <br/>Probst: The two talked strategy, and Julie made her  move.  <br/>I'd be down. I'd be faithful.  <br/>Yes?  <br/>I would. Cheers. ( laughter )  <br/>Probst: Back at camp...  <br/>Look at you. She's all pissed off.  <br/>Probst: Eliza was livid, because the challenge revealed  the girls' pecking order, and she was first to go.  <br/>It is personal. It's definitely personal.  <br/>Oh, Eliza, good grief!  <br/>Probst: The men saw an opportunity to break the women's  alliance.  <br/>We see a weakness right there.  <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, Ami mastered the  puzzle... Ami wins immunity. ...and claimed victory. Safe tonight at the vote  is this woman, Ami. Back at Alinta...  <br/>You're a horrible dancer.  <br/>I know.  <br/>Probst: ...Scout worried that Julie had charmed Leann and  stole her "final four" spot.  <br/>Jules and Leann have gotten to be kind of tight since they  went on their little trip together. Hell, I might get sent home  tonight.  <br/>Probst: And Chris considered his own strategies.  <br/>We don't have the numbers. Unless we can pull something  off with Twila and Eliza, it's over.  <br/>Probst: But at Tribal Council, the women's alliance held  strong, and Chris made a move to save himself.  <br/>This is for you, not against you.  <br/>Probst: Tenth person voted out of Survivor: Vanuatu...  Sarge, the tribe has spoken. Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight?  Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION (theme song playing)  * ( snorting )  <br/>That was the toughest Tribal Council I've been to.  <br/>Me, too.  <br/>And I can tell everybody why.  <br/>Why?  <br/>Why?  <br/>Ten minutes before we left camp, Sarge asked me who I was  voting for. I told him I hadn't decided, and I didn't know, that I-I just  didn't know what to do. Right before we started walking, he grabbed me by the  shoulder and told me to vote for him. I asked him why. He said, just do it,  everybody else is. I voted for Sarge. I told them that Sarge told me to vote  for him, but he didn't. Um, I voted for Sarge... to stay close to the women  and, you know, go further in the game. You know, this is for the best. Uh,  this is for my personal, you know, reasons in the game to try to get as far  as I can. ( birds singing )  <br/>( whispering ): Ami and Leann have turned. They've changed  their alliance from, uh, Twila and myself being in the top four, moving Jules  into a spot, and she didn't deserve it. I'm not gonna sit by and let that  happen. This morning I went to the guys at the fire, and I whispered to them  that I had plan to keep them in the game. I asked them not to tell anybody.  Told them I needed to talk to Twila, and I'd get back with them. The plan  that I have would take out Eliza, then take out Ami. We got to get Ami out of  there. She's a strong contender, and she's, uh, manipulative, and it's a  whole different game, then.  <br/>We have mail. Wild mail. "To this challenge, you'll  bring your pig. Some will push and some will dig. It just depends on how you  move through the earth. Today you'll see how much your little piggy's  worth."  <br/>Oh... ( snorting )  <br/>Want me to carry him?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>This ought to be real fun with this pig today. ( pig  squealing ) ( indistinct chatter ) ( pig squealing )  <br/>Probst: The Alinta mascot.  <br/>He needs a buff.  <br/>Probst: You know, I thought you might want a buff. I did  have one ready. Chris, you want to do the honors?  <br/>Awesome.  <br/>Probst: Does he have a name?  <br/>He's had about 15 names, but Piggy is what stuck.  Piggy.  <br/>Probst: Come on, buddy.  <br/>Here you go. Go on.  <br/>Probst: Has it been nice having a little company at  camp?  <br/>Not when you're hungry, and you want meat. ( laughter  )  <br/>Twila.  <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready to get to today's  challenge?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Sure thing.  <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, you will be randomly  divided into two tribes of four. You'll compete in this obstacle course. One  person will be your sacrificial lamb. They will be attached to a rope which  runs the entire length of this obstacle course. They will also have their  hands tied. So the other three tribe members will be responsible for getting  them through all five stages of the course. For the first stage, you'll go up  and over a three-level fence. You'll then maneuver through a series of hitching  posts. You'll then climb up and over a wall. You will then dig under a log.  And then finally, you will maneuver through a vertical rope maze. First tribe  to get all four of their people to their final tam-tam wins reward. You want  to know what you're playing for?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: The winning foursome will leave here, be taken to  another island for an overnight visit...  <br/>Yes!  <br/>Probst: ...where you will be hosted by a village. This  will be an amazing, once-in-a-lifetime experience with a tribe who lives very  differently from you. You'll be treated to all kinds of cultural activities,  including a major feast.  <br/>Oh, wow!  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Let's do it.  <br/>Probst: Because it is customary to bring a token of  appreciation...  <br/>The pig.  <br/>Probst: ... you will bring the pig, and give this to the  village. All right, for the two groups, we're gonna draw numbers. Let's go  down and get started. All right, here are the teams on the black rope: Scout,  Twila, Julie and Leann. Julie is the sacrificial lamb. On the orange rope:  Chad, Ami Eliza and Chris. Eliza is the sacrificial lamb. Here we go. For  reward. Survivors, ready... go!  <br/>You need help? You need a push?  <br/>Probst: Julie up and over.  <br/>Come on.  <br/>Now what?  <br/>Probst: Chris grabs Eliza who somersaults.  <br/>Get her, get her, get her.  <br/>I got her, I got her. I got you, Eliza.  <br/>Hurry, girl. Hurry, girl.  <br/>Probst: Julie moving.  <br/>Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh, yeah... nope.  <br/>Got you.  <br/>Probst: Up and over again...  <br/>Over, Chad.  <br/>Probst: ...at the mercy of her team.  <br/>Oh, she's stuck.  <br/>Slack is...  <br/>Chad, pull her through. Chad, pull her through.  <br/>Probst: Eliza up and over one more time, and we're just on  the first part of the course.  <br/>Get her, Chad, get her.  <br/>Nice and easy.  <br/>You all right? Go, go...  <br/>Probst: Eliza through the first obstacle, races ahead to  the hitching post.  <br/>Give me slack.  <br/>Probst: Julie, Twila, Leann and Scout falling  behind.  <br/>Here, here.  <br/>Probst: Julie being held in mid-air.  <br/>Bring you down...  <br/>Thanks, Chris. Wait. Her legs are caught.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Probst: Eliza stuck in the rope...  <br/>Chad, get over there and give me some slack.  <br/>Probst: ...trying to get her legs undone.  <br/>Don't pull your legs.  <br/>Oh, oh, real good. Take your time.  <br/>Yeah...  <br/>Probst: Chad just yanks them out.  <br/>I got her.  <br/>Up and around and down and out. Go, go, go...  <br/>Probst: Julie's through the first obstacle.  <br/>Go, go, go! Out of the way. Go, go, go. Go, go, go,  go...  <br/>Probst: Julie's tribe arrives at the second  obstacle.  <br/>Go.  <br/>You got her? You sure?  <br/>Probst: Eliza getting tossed again.  <br/>Just hurry, up and over.  <br/>Probst: Up and over. That belly is going to have some  marks.  <br/>Good job, Eliza.  <br/>Okay...  <br/>Slacks on the other way, the other way.  <br/>Slack. Slack, slack, slack, slack...  <br/>Probst: Eliza's tribe doing a great job with the slack,  working her way around the post.  <br/>Lots of slack.  <br/>Probst: They're through the hitching post.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Probst: Eliza, Chad, Chris and Ami on to the third  obstacle.  <br/>Nice job.  <br/>Let's go, girl. Let's go, girl. Here you go...  <br/>One more. ( Julie grunts )  <br/>You all right? You all right?  <br/>Some more.  <br/>Some more...  <br/>...slack. I'll get the slack. You get her? Get her.  <br/>Probst: Eliza, up and over the wall. Great teamwork.  <br/>Put me down, put me down.  <br/>Okay, now go, go, go, go, go.  <br/>Probst: Here comes Julie, Twila, Scout and Leann. They've  made up some time.  <br/>Go, go. All right...  <br/>Probst: They really move to stay in this.  <br/>Under and over. Under and over. Now, one more time around  and back.  <br/>Probst: Julie really throwing herself over these walls.  Eliza, Chris, Chad and Ami still with the lead.  <br/>Step, step.  <br/>Probst: Julie, Twila, Leann and Scout are working hard to  catch up.  <br/>Come on, come on.  <br/>Probst: Julie launches herself over again.  <br/>Pull it.  <br/>The stomach rolls.  <br/>Come on. I got you. Come on. Down this way.  <br/>Got you.  <br/>Drop your feet, drop your feet.  <br/>Probst: Ami leading Eliza through, and she's out.  <br/>Come on, come on.  <br/>Jump up, Jules. Jump up, Jules.  <br/>All right, run, run.  <br/>Hurry, hurry, they're right on us, they're right on  us.  <br/>Come on.  <br/>Through, through.  <br/>I don't know if this is gonna work.  <br/>Probst: They've dug a hole. Will she fit?  <br/>Fit, fit, fit...  <br/>There you go.  <br/>Probst: Going to take her face off.  <br/>Pull, pull.  <br/>Probst: Chris pulls her through anyway.  <br/>Come on, guys. Come on...  <br/>Probst: Julie, shoving herself through.  <br/>Ow!  <br/>Probst: Leann yanks on her.  <br/>Come on. Go. Come on, got you. Go.  <br/>My shoulders, my shoulders.  <br/>Come on.  <br/>Probst: Eliza going through for her second time. Once  again, just misses her nose. They're on to the final obstacle. Chad, Chris,  Eliza and Ami at the final vertical rope maze.  <br/>Okay, now, go. Now got down. Yeah, that's right.  <br/>Come on, come on...  <br/>Pull, pull...  <br/>Probst: Julie going to have to go face first in the sand.  Why they're going this way, I don't know, but they're through. This is it.  Both tribes at the final vertical rope maze. Eliza starting to make her way  through the rope maze.  <br/>Those guys are coming. Quick.  <br/>Nice job.  <br/>Probst: Julie enters the rope maze, shoving the rope over.  Very close.  <br/>Go, go, go.  <br/>Step up...  <br/>Take a step. Step.  <br/>Come on. They're trying again. Come on, come on.  <br/>...Too slow. Bring that low. There you go. Step  through.  <br/>There you go.  <br/>Probst: Eliza's team still with the lead.  <br/>Yup.  <br/>Come on.  <br/>Probst: Julie trying to catch up. Chris just going to  shove her through. Chris and Chad carrying Eliza through this rope maze.  Twila, Scout, Julie and Leann are making up ground. Julie having to pull  herself up. Ami and Twila trying to help out.  <br/>Want me to lift...?  <br/>Nice job.  <br/>Probst: Chad, Eliza, Ami, very close.  <br/>One more.  <br/>Probst: Twila, Leann, Scout and Julie not giving up,  though.  <br/>This...this one right here.  <br/>...through. Come on.  <br/>She doesn't need it.  <br/>Probst: Chris just shoves Eliza through, using his  strength.  <br/>A leg.  <br/>You are through. You are through!  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: That's it. Eliza, Chad, Ami, Chris win reward. (  cheering )  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: ...overnight visit.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Julie, you were getting tossed around, banged  around-- how you doing?  <br/>I'm fine.  <br/>Probst: Are you upset because you lost or because you're  hurt?  <br/>Uh, 'cause we lost. It's a lot of work.  <br/>Probst: You guys, get your stuff, head back to camp. For  you four, you will have a great experience, a chance to get away from camp,  fill up your bellies. Take your pig, head on out and have a good night.  <br/>Ami, Chad, Chris and I, we're going on an overnight visit  in a village, and we were so excited, and we were bringing Piggy as a gift  for the tribe that we are visiting. But Piggy peed on the plane. That  stunk.  <br/>Wonderful flight, Captain. ( pig squealing )  <br/>How long you going to be a grouch?  <br/>We were in the very, very back country. I don't think we  could have gone any further to get away from civilization.  <br/>It seemed like we went to a whole other world.  <br/>Who should we give the pig to? ( indistinct talking  )  <br/>Chief. None of us knew what to expect. People from the  village looking at us, and we're looking at them, and I'm carrying a pig.  Chief. We'd like to offer you this. ( pig squealing )  <br/>We handed the chief Piggy, and he was very appreciative,  and they gave us a pig back.  <br/>Thank you. ( applause ) Me, Ami, Eliza and Chad were just,  like, "Damn, they're giving us a pig back." You know, but, yeah...  The pig -- they give us a pig in return, and they actually just had us lay it  down by a bench where we were sitting, and we just never asked for the pig  back. We didn't want the pig. ( pig snorting ) ( tribal singing, chanting  )  <br/>Once they started dancing, like really doing the  traditional dancing, we were watching that, it was amazing. They don't use  any instruments. They just use claps of their hands, stomp of their feet and  their voices. Like... ( ululating ) Like... I could feel the vibration of  their feet stomping. ( singing ) It was amazing, like out of a book. It  looked like we were in the middle of a book. ( singing ) The chief said  "Do you want to dance?" And I was like, "Yeah, I want to  dance. Dancing sounds great."  <br/>Yes, okay. Okay. That's wonderful. Thank you. They brought  us bowls of kava... and me and Chad and Ami and Eliza-- we all drank a bowl  of kava.  <br/>Drink.  <br/>You drink the whole thing?  <br/>Yeah, yeah, the whole thing, yeah.  <br/>Oh.  <br/>You just say... Okay, you chug it, and then you spit out  your last sip. And this bowl was enormous, and it kind of tastes like mud  mixed with water and vodka. ( spitting ) Almost immediately, my mouth started  feeling numb, and my tongue started feeling numb. It was definitely a strange  feeling. ( spitting )  <br/>The kava is powerful, very, very powerful.  <br/>Like, I feel sort of buzzed, but my inclination is just,  "Whoa, wait."  <br/>Yeah. You're holding on to my shoulders for dear  life.  <br/>After that kava, I started spinning into a kava- induced,  uh...stupor.  <br/>Chad had too much kava.  <br/>I'm all right.  <br/>You wild man.  <br/>God, I can barely stand up. I am thrown from that kava. I  couldn't walk. I couldn't... I wasn't coordinated.  <br/>The kava tore him up! The kava tore him up! We'll never  experience nothing like this again the rest of our lives.  <br/>Uh-uh. Wow, man... wow.  <br/>Smells delicious. That looks good. ( laughing )  <br/>When we were thinking feast, we were thinking plates of  steak, anything cooked... but they had the cow's head and then banana leaves  laid out, and they had all this meat just piled on it. What's it like?  <br/>Uh... rubber. It wasn't cooked all the way. There wasn't a  lot of flavor to it. There was a lot of... fat. It just wasn't something that  I was used to. The food definitely isn't the reward part of this.  <br/>No.  <br/>No. ( singing in native language ) All the children were  gathered around this little tiny fire, and they were teaching the song that  they had learned for the Americans, and their smiles touched me in a way I'll  never forget. This was the highlight of my entire night. ( singing )  <br/>* We are very happy When you visit Our... village here  today. *  <br/>It was the most unbelievable reward we could've possibly  ever gotten. ( cheering ) Yeah!  <br/>I'm catching on to that song.  <br/>Yeah. ( thunder crashing ) ( Scout groaning )  <br/>I think that'll help the fire for a little while. Oh,  God.  <br/>It's been raining forever!  <br/>Oh, man, it is just raining cats and dogs. It looks like  it's set in for days. Everything is soaking wet. It's going to be a miracle  if we can keep our fire. I-I've never been in a worse situation than this,  really.  <br/>This is the... by far the worst night, by far the worst  night. It won't stop ... raining, and I don't care if I can't swear. (  laughing ) It won't stop raining. It's freezing. Everything we have is soaked.  I don't even want to think about what the other four are doing at the moment.  I'm sure they're having a great time, and they're comfortable, and that's  just enough to make me mad thinking about it.  <br/>Piss and moan! ( laughing ) That's all we can do!  <br/>God, oh, and wait for it to go away.  <br/>I had one hell of a night. It rained cats and dogs, and  our shelter just... it just poured in. Our blankets were drenched. Our  clothes were drenched. Our pillows are drenched, everything. And the timing  was just right, and I said, "You know what, you guys, keeping this fire  going... I tell you what. We ought to, uh, send Eliza on home and, uh, and,  uh, keep these guys around another few days. Let 'em help us with the fire  and collecting wood." Then... the game changes.  <br/>* Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! *  <br/>Yeah, you know, her time's definitely overdue.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Five on that.  <br/>She should've... You all... I don't know how you all kept  her as long as you did. I don't know.  <br/>Yeah, I don't...  <br/>So, you want to tell Ami?  <br/>Oh, we can tell Ami. No.  <br/>I think so.  <br/>I think Ami's cool with it, but... Yeah, the guys don't  need to know.  <br/>Listen, here's their... The guys will vote with us,  because here's their choice.  <br/>"Don't vote with us, and one of you guys are going  home tonight."  <br/>"Eliza, or one of you. Take your pick."  <br/>That's true.  <br/>Want to hit the trail mix first?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>There's no fire. I'll start on it. Is that cool?  <br/>Yeah, yeah.  <br/>You guys want to coconut it up?  <br/>We'll coconut...  <br/>Hey. Home sweet home.  <br/>Did it rain on you guys?  <br/>Oh, yeah, it rained off and on.  <br/>But-but you were inside.  <br/>Um, we ended up in a hut at the end of the night that  didn't ra... that didn't, um... leak.  <br/>But the food and the sleeping arrangements, seriously,  were horrible.  <br/>Swear to God.  <br/>But you didn't have to sleep with wet blankets, and you  didn't get poured on, right?  <br/>We did not get poured  <br/>At least there's that.  <br/>When-when we got back, it was as if... they couldn't be  less excited to see us.  <br/>It was nice to be around the kids. That my favorite,  favorite, favorite, favorite part. And all I could see was the sea of little  kids' faces all around the fire-- this little tiny fire. We were all hunched  down. I was sitting down on the ground like this. They were all hunched all  around, and I could feel a little kid's head on my head. I loved that  part.  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>Very interesting. Coming back to camp, there was no welcome.  Just could care a less. "Whatever, you had a good time, whatever, yadda,  yad. Sit down and do your work or whatever you need to do." It's pretty  much how the welcome went. But I could definitely tell something had gone on.  I had really weird feelings. Jules didn't... wouldn't look me in the face,  would not look me in the face, which makes me think, "Oh, God, what  conversations have been going on while I haven't been here?"  <br/>You want to hear about the whole plan?  <br/>Yes, I'd love to.  <br/>You want to hear the whole plan? All right, Jules, Leann,  Twila, myself-- we all want to get rid of Liza. Like having a rattlesnake in  your pocket.  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>So, we got to keep Liza from getting immunity, anybody get  immunity but Liza, and vote Liza off, and then from there, we got to get rid  of Ami immediately. We've got to get Ami out, because she is...  <br/>The brains.  <br/>And we'll play ball with you guys, 'cause we think it will  be a lot more fun.  <br/>It would. It will be.  <br/>We just really love you guys. I'm just thrilled.  <br/>I'm not going to make this obvious, I'm going to head back  with my wood. Yeah, things have changed. There's dissension in the ranks. The  women are not tight, and the women come across cocky, confident. They have  since the merge, since Rory went home, and it got to Scout the way the other  girls were coming across-- you know, the cocky way Ami presents herself. Me  and Chad, we're doing our best. We're playing it. We're tugging at their  hearts. They are rolling in it. Scout bit. You question a woman's character,  you question a woman's ability, she'll snap your neck. You open up your  heart, show a woman you're vulnerable, then they start thinking with their  heart. That's when they open up that back door. That's what's happened this  time.  <br/>Probst: Morning.  <br/>Morning, Jeff.  <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?  <br/>Sure thing.  <br/>Probst: First things first. Ami, give it up. Immunity--  back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to climb up a ladder  that is leaning against a post. On my go, you'll step off of the ladder,  reach out, grab onto the post and hang on for as long as you can. When your  feet touch the ground, you're out of the challenge. Last person left hanging  on the post wins immunity, safe from the vote. We've randomly drawn for your  positions. Take your spot, wait for my go. For immunity. Three, two, one,  everybody step up. And we are on. Ami loses a little bit of a grip. Twila  starting to slide, trying to find a new footing. She's got it. Julie's  sliding. Julie coming down another notch, finds a bit of rope to put her feet  on. Twila just bear-hugging it, trying to find a way to grip it. Julie first  one out. Have a seat on the pole. Ami starting to slip. Holding on with her  fingertips. Chris starting to slide. Chris is out. Scout starting to slide.  Scout is out. Scout joins Chris and Julie. Ami sliding down. That can't feel  good. Ami's out. Take a spot on the pole. Eliza starting to slide.  <br/>Oh, God!  <br/>Probst: Ooh! You all right?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: We are down to three. Immunity at stake. Tribal  council tonight. Twila biting the rope, going to hold on with her teeth. Chad  starting to show signs of slipping.  <br/>You're doing good, Chad.  <br/>Probst: Chad struggling to hang on, gripping with his  thighs. Twila still chewing on that rope. Leann slides, finds a new foothold.  Twila trying to climb back up. Every time you move, you risk falling more.  Chad sliding down a little more. Leann is struggling. She's sliding, she's  fighting it. Leann's out. We are down to two-- Chad, Twila. Chad gripping  with his fingers on that rope. And Chad is slipping.  <br/>Go Chad, go down, Chad.  <br/>Probst: Chad's slipping, looking for something to get a  foot on. The last bit of rope.  <br/>Go down, Chad, go. Go down, Chad. Go down, Chad, go down,  Chad. Please, God, go down, Chad.  <br/>Probst: Chad is out. Twila wins immunity.  <br/>Yes!  <br/>Probst: Nice work. All right, Twila, turn around here. I  know you want this.  <br/>Yes. Jeff: Feels good?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Probst: Safe from the vote tonight. Everybody else on the  block. You'll vote somebody out and have another member of our jury. I'll see  you there. Get your stuff and head back to camp.  <br/>Thanks, man.  <br/>So, are we voting for Chad tonight?  <br/>I think there's a way that, you know, if we were to give  the guys longer in the game, I think there's a way we could go ahead and send  Liza home. You just have to spend one night sitting in a downpouring rain  trying to keep a fire going to appreciate...  <br/>I sat out here by myself one night and kept the fire going  all night. I'm willing to do fire duty with you. It just scares me to think  that one of the girls would be going home before the guys.  <br/>You and Jules and Leann, you're such strong  competitors.  <br/>I think we got most of the big rocks. Scout and I were  definitely at odds about how the vote should go. She really wants to get rid  of Eliza, but I thought getting rid of Eliza tonight was not a good idea at  all. Let's kind of stick to the game plan, and not have to worry later that  there's two strong men that could win immunity, and we're going to have to  start voting out women. One of these guys can make it all the way to the end.  This game is not over. So are we for sure voting Chad tonight?  <br/>I'm still up in the air right now.  <br/>I think that's a good idea. Don't you think?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>It was just making me excited the other way.  <br/>I know.  <br/>Everyone excited.  <br/>Going to Tribal Council for me is just let's get it done.  Let's take care of the vote, let's get home, let's work on tonight and  hopefully start out with a nice, dry day tomorrow. I don't think it's time  for Eliza to be voted off yet. I just don't.  <br/>After getting back from the challenge, everybody's mood  seemed to be a little different. I just sensed that Scout was not getting the  results from the other women to vote for Eliza. Gotta hydrate; big night  around the fire tonight. At this point, I'm just going to try to reassure  those in ourg to voting bloc, which is what I think is our voting bloc, to  keep with the same vote that we had planned. So, it's still the same vote tonight,  right? Has everything changed?  <br/>I have no idea what's going on.  <br/>Are you kidding me?  <br/>No, ma'am, sir. I thought you said they talked to  you.  <br/>Who, Chris?  <br/>No, uh... Scout.  <br/>Well, she's been saying stuff for, you know, the last few  days, and everything looks good, but just from what Ami and, uh, just from  what, the way that they're acting, man, it just doesn't look good for  me.  <br/>Here you go. I want to get out of the rain. I'm about half  dry.  <br/>Man, it is up in the air right now, and there's some  last-minute fierce negotiation. Twila has immunity tonight, so there's no  reason she shouldn't vote with us.  <br/>Honey, don't ask me. I'm not the person to ask. I'm  certainly not the person to ask.  <br/>There's only one person that's made...  <br/>So I'm pissed.  <br/>Are you? Well, we are, too.  <br/>You friggin' pissed me off.  <br/>Really?  <br/>Well, I've been wanting to get rid of her since day  one.  <br/>We have an...  <br/>But it don't matter to me. I told... I told Ami,  "Whatever you all decide, come back and let me know," 'cause it  don't matter to me. I just don't like the bitch.  <br/>I know.  <br/>I didn't like her from day, and I want to get rid of  her.  <br/>I know.  <br/>But...  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>It's drama central today. ( Leann laughs ) It is friggin'  soap opera-ville.  <br/>Yep.  <br/>Scout?  <br/>Yeah?  <br/>You know you got Ami asking all kinds of questions. She  don't want to vote for Eliza. She wants to go ahead and vote one of the guys  out. She thinks it's stupid to vote for one of the women when you still got  two guys that can win immunity, and she's right. I don't know. I feel like  I'm being pulled from both directions. I'm being pulled, because you feel  like you're fifth, so you want me to go with you, and I'm feeling like  they're... I don't know if I can trust them or not, and I'm going, "You  know, I don't know what to do here," but they're not going to vote for  Eliza. I'm telling you right now, them four... It's going to be four against  four.  <br/>All right, will you... will you let me talk and listen to  the logic?  <br/>You gonna have to hurry, 'cause I got to go that  a'way.  <br/>The logic is, is that we have, with the two guys and you  and me, we have four votes to their three votes.  <br/>But that's not going to happen, though. They're not going  to do it, and somebody's going to have to draw a rock tonight and go home.  Would you like to be out of this game by a friggin' stone? Well, I  wouldn't.  <br/>All right, so... so what what you're going to...  <br/>I'm not going to do nothing yet. I'm still thinking. I'm  aggravated, but I have to go this way. I definitely feel stuck in the middle  right now, and it's tearing me up, 'cause I don't know. You know, it's like  I'm going to get somebody pissed off at me either way, so I'm screwed. The  guys are depending on me and Scout to pull through for them. That's the only  way they're going to stay in the game. I don't know which way to go. You  know, I'd really... Yes, I'm like Scout. Yes, I'd like the hands to be turned  and Ami not be in charge right now, but I don't know if that's going to  happen.  <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the first member of our jury,  Sarge, voted out at the last Tribal Council. He is here merely to observe and  gather information. Big change in the weather last few days. A lot more  water. Rain coming down. Everybody here seems to be cold. Leann, does that  change anything at this point in the game?  <br/>Um, I'm not good with the rain. I'm worried that I'm just  going to... freak out and not be able to handle it. It makes me crazy!  <br/>Probst: Chris, no secret there's been talk of the women  sticking together and picking off the men. Have you noticed in the last  couple of days that maybe your stock and Chad's stock might've gone up a  little bit?  <br/>Absolutely. It's crossed my mind that, you know, possibly,  our stock, you know, did go up because of what we can do around camp.  <br/>Probst: Chad, guys have taken some knocks. You still  fighting in this game?  <br/>Hell, yeah, we're still fighting. I-I'll tell you. Chris  and I have come up with about 25 or 30 different plans, different ways of weaseling  out of-of this situation we're in.  <br/>Probst: Scout, are you seeing scurrying around, or has  anybody come up to you?  <br/>Yes, many people have come up, and, uh, we've talked quite  a bit about different strategies and plans to get to the end of the  game.  <br/>Probst: Scout-- and you guys tell me if I'm wrong-- do you  think Chris and Chad are both listening, thinking, "Maybe our plans have  worked?"  <br/>I think the guys have talked to everybody.  <br/>Not me.  <br/>Not me.  <br/>It's not just me.  <br/>And not me.  <br/>Probst: So this is news to you?  <br/>Yeah, and it makes me nervous that-that two women might be  voting with the two men, and that it will be a four-four tie, and that's  exactly what makes me uncomfortable.  <br/>Probst: Do you think you might've have missed out on  something being gone?  <br/>Definitely possible, yeah. I mean, it's possible that that  night brought them together in such a way that things have changed since  then.  <br/>Probst: Well, here was my question. Twila, do you think  you'll ever get used to the fact that you can never ever feel safe?  <br/>When it comes right down to it, you can't trust anybody.  The most'll be 99. 9%, but... I don't know. Y-You always have that little bit  in your mind, "Can I, or can I not?"  <br/>Probst: Now, Ami, you have a smile on your face that's so  smug.  <br/>Yeah, 'cause I think that is such bull... I don't question  that one bit. Like, I definitely know that there are people I can trust, and  I know I can be trusted.  <br/>Probst: And we'll find out if you're sitting in the final  two whether you're right or whether you're wrong.  <br/>Totally, totally.  <br/>Probst: All right. Okay, it is time to vote. Twila, you  have immunity. I'm guessing you're not giving that up.  <br/>No.  <br/>Probst: All right, Twila is the only person you cannot  vote for. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Scout, you're  up.  <br/>Chad, I'm sorry. I have to stick true to my alliance and  my word, and you're the next one to go. Sorry, bud.  <br/>Eliza, you've been on the chopping block seems like  forever, and with this vote, I hope that my alliance stays strong.  <br/>Eliza, I'm voting for you because your alliance people  told me to vote for you.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read,  the decision is final. Person voted out'll be asked to to leave the Tribal  Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Eliza. Eliza.  Two votes Eliza. Chad. Two votes Eliza, one vote Chad. Chad. Two votes Eliza,  two votes Chad. Chad. Three votes Chad, two votes Eliza. Chad. That's four  votes Chad, two votes Eliza. 11th person voted out of Survivor: Vanuatu:  Chad. That's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Chad, the  tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Well, with only one man, the women  in this tribe must now begin to think, "Hmm, where do I fall in the  pecking order?" And suddenly, that one man could become very valuable.  12 days left. Gonna be fun. Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

Next time on  Survivor:  <br/>Scout and Twila come to me and Chad, wanting to form an  alliance with us. Swear to God on my family's lives. I narced out Scout and  Twila.  <br/>Probst: The girls confront Scout.  <br/>It's not Scout's idea. That is what I'm trying to tell  you. ( hisses ) My hackles came up.  <br/>Ami was the one that single-handedly convinced the women  outside of Scout, Twila, Chris and I to change their vote from Eliza to me,  and I don't know how she did it, but she did it. She used the woman power  thing, and what can I say? I-I'm not sore or sour, but, damn, you know? I  wish I could've gone further.
