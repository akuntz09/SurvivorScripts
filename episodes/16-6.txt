<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: Ozzy found the hidden  immunity idol on Exile Island and replaced it with a fake one as a decoy. The  idol put Ozzy and his alliance of Amanda, Parvati, and James in control of the  game.  <br/>It's in our little four clique, and I think it's going to  stay in our little four clique.  <br/>Jeff: But their control was short-lived.... Drop your  buffs. We are switching tribes. ...as the fans and favorites were mixed. You  must choose somebody from the opposite tribe.  <br/>James.  <br/>Jeff: James joins the new Airai tribe. Ozzy's alliance was  split when James and Parvati went to Airai.  <br/>Oh, don't look so pissed off. The new Malakal tribe  combined Ozzy, Amanda, Amy, and Cirie from the favorites with Joel, Erik,  Tracy, and Chet from the fans. The new Airai combined James, Parvati,  Jonathan, and Eliza from the favorites with Natalie, Alexis, Jason, and Kathy  from the fans. At the new Airai...  <br/>Ow! Damn it!  <br/>Jeff: Jonathan was seriously injured and required  stitches. But his injury didn't keep his tribe from winning immunity. Airai  wins! At Malakal, Joel came up with a plan.  <br/>What do you think?  <br/>Jeff: But the favorites had a different idea.  <br/>Joel is a bigger threat for us than Chet is.  <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, the fans on the new Malakal tribe  got a firsthand lesson on how the favorites operate. The favorites used Tracy  and Chet to blindside Joel. Joel, the tribe has spoken. 15 are left. 15 are  left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight?  <br/>Joel just kind of sat there just in disbelief, and then at  the end of it, he didn't, like, make any emotion at all. And then he was  gone. I felt pretty shafted to see Joel go. I mean, those guys are tough as  nails. You cannot trust favorites at all. They're tanks. I mean, they have  armor on. If the playing field has been lowered to lying and just tricking  people straight to their face, I think I might have their face, I think I  might have to do some of that. to do some of that.

Joel was popping anyway. It was so  hard to vote off Joel. They had four and we had four. And we should have  gained control against the favorites. But Joel was hell bent on getting rid  of Chet, taking away my alliance. So what are you going to do? And this is  absolutely driving And this is absolutely driving me batty not being in  control. me batty not being in control.  <br/>...to bend over.  <br/>These guys are vicious.  <br/>They are so vicious. And I think you are next to go.  You're a threat. They don't want to compete They don't want to compete  against you. against you.  <br/>Yeah, they aren't going to take you with them. You need to  understand that. They're not going to take me with them. The only thing that  we can do is to try to get one of them to vote with us. If we can get one of  them off, then we're back. then we're back. That's all we need. That's all we  need. I'm just going to boil a bunch to get it really soft.  <br/>You look like a chicken  <br/>You look like a chicken farmer. farmer.  <br/>Are you doing okay?  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>Right where you are right now is where I was when I first  came here.  <br/>Tracy seemed like she'd given up, so I went and had a pep  talk with her. Even though I'm, like, at the bottom of the rung in the old  Malakal, I'm not going to be poo pants, because the more you're poo pants,  the sooner you're going out. You've just got to keep on going, you  know?  <br/>Thanks.  <br/>Yeah, of course. I just don't like to see when somebody is  having a really rough time. And I know how it feels.  <br/>I was never part of the original alliance between James,  Parvati, Cirie, Amanda, and Ozzy. So I'm also in a very vulnerable situation.  Maybe I need to play the game a little differently, but I'm thinking in baby  steps right thinking in baby steps right now, and we'll see what happens.  now, and we'll see what happens.  <br/>It's feeling better. More slowly than I wish, but it is  getting there. is getting there. No question. No question. But it would just  suck, because he's really a good motivator, a he's really a good motivator, a  good guy to have around. good guy to have around.  <br/>I loved it. I think we turned out... I mean, we got the  wrong beach, we got the better tribe, for sure.  <br/>Fans versus favorites is over in my mind. As a new Airai  tribe, we are four fans and four favorites, but I think once we earn the  fans' trust, Jonathan and I are going to try to work with them, and  definitely get rid of Parvati and James before there is any type of merge and  they can get back with Amanda and can get back with Amanda and Ozzy. Ozzy.  Ozzy.  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! Malakal, come on in. Malakal, come  on in. Airai getting your first look at the new Malakal tribe.  <br/>Joel is out?  <br/>Jeff: Joel voted out at the  <br/>Jeff: Joel voted out at the last tribal council. last  tribal council.  <br/>Jeff: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: On my go, both tribes will swim out and collect  several bundles of planks, sticks, and rope. You'll have ten minutes to use  these materials to build a blockade in the other tribe's tunnel. Once the ten  minutes are up, you'll then race to tear down the blockade that the other  tribe built in your tunnel. First tribe to get all their members through  their tunnel and on the mat win reward. Want to know what you're playing  for?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: For the winning tribe, two native Micronesians who  spent their entire life living off this land will come to your camp and show  you how to get the most out of it. If you pay attention, it will change camp  life. Worth playing for?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Absolutely!  <br/>Jeff: In addition, the winning tribe will choose one  member from the losing tribe to go to Exile Island. You will also select one  member from your own tribe to join them. On Exile, you'll find a clue to the  whereabouts of the hidden immunity idol. Airai, you have one extra member.  Sitting somebody out. Cannot sit out the same person in back-to-back  challenges. Who's it going to be?  <br/>I think I can be very helpful in putting this together and  pushing through. Absolutely.  <br/>I'll sit out.  <br/>Jeff: Natalie is going to sit this one out. Take a spot on  the bench, give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. Here we go.  For reward. Survivors ready? Survivors ready? Go! Go! You've got to swim out,  collect all your materials, get them back to your mat before you can start  building. Ozzy first to the platform for Malakal. Jason right behind for  Airai. Jason tossing them out to his tribemates. Ozzy and Erik tossing them  out to their tribemates.  <br/>All right, bring them back! Start moving them back!  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy and Erik making their way back. James and Kathy  heading back with a couple of bundles for Airai. Ami right behind with  bundles for Malakal. Penner really limping on that bad leg. bad leg. Trying  to muscle them up. Trying to muscle them up. Penner takes a big fall. That  leg is really giving him trouble. Malakal, you have everything. Malakal, you  have everything. Start building! Start building! Airai has everything back.  They're building. You have ten minutes to use all these materials to build a  blockade in the other tribe's tunnel. You're trying to prevent them You're  trying to prevent them from getting through. from getting through.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie, Ozzy, and Tracy have got a blockade going in  the have got a blockade going in the front. front.  <br/>JAMIE: A lot of quiet tribe strategy going on. strategy  going on. You have five minutes left. You have five minutes left. Last 30  seconds. Make them count. Big reward. When the time is up, I'm going to tell  to you switch sides, and you will start tearing down what the other tribe has  built up. Five, four, three, two, one. Switch. Now your goal is to get  through the blockade the other tribe just created. Malakal making quick work  of Airai's first big blockade. The Airai tribe having a little more  trouble.  <br/>Let's push it out, Oz.  <br/>JAMIE: Ozzy is in the tunnel for Malakal. Malakal already  making their way through their tunnel. Airai not even in theirs yet. Penner,  bad leg and all, ripping those planks out of there.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie and Ozzy are in the tunnel for Malakal. Jason  the first to go in for Airai. Crawling over the top. He's halfway through.  Eliza right behind. Got to get all tribe members through the tunnel and onto  the mat. Doesn't matter if you leave any of the blockade behind. Just get  yourselves through.  <br/>Come on, get through.  <br/>Push through, guys, push through. Looking good, guys!  Looking good!  <br/>Go! Go! Go!  <br/>Jeff: Airai has a lot of members getting through this  tunnel quickly, all of a sudden. They got through the first big blockade and  that's all there was. Eliza is out, Parvati is out. Malakal falling behind  now. Alexis is through. James and Jason staying inside to help people  through. to help people through. Penner dragging himself through. Penner  dragging himself through.  <br/>Jeff: Airai almost through their tunnel. Ozzy trying to  get out. Kathy's through. Ozzy is out for Malakal. Penner's through. Penner's  through. Airai wins reward! Airai wins reward! Airai, congratulations. First  order of business, choose one member of the Malakal tribe to go to Exile Island.  Who is it going to be?  <br/>Chet.  <br/>Jeff: Chet. All right, now, Airai, you have to choose  somebody to join Chet, someone from your own tribe. Who's going to go?  <br/>Good man.  <br/>Jeff: Jason going to Exile Island along with Chet. You  guys will rejoin your tribes You guys will rejoin your tribes at the next  immunity challenge. at the next immunity challenge. Malakal, got nothing for  you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp.  <br/>Bye, guys.  <br/>Good job, guys.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Jeff: All right, Airai, here's what's going to happen--  you're going to go back to your camp. Two native Micronesians are going to  show up. Utilize these guys. Ask them every question you can think of. Before  that happens, Penner, medical's going to take a look medical's going to take  a look at that knee. at that knee.  <br/>Do you have any pain in your groin at all, up in here? Is  it a bit tender in here?  <br/>Yeah, a little bit, but not terrible.  <br/>See, I mean, Jonathan, there's a big abscess in there, a big  collection of pus. This is going to need intravenous antibiotics. It probably  needs surgical washout. It's not going to be a quick fix.  <br/>Oh, god bless it. I'm not quitting.  <br/>I can only recommend that you get treatment in hospital  for the sake of your knee. Antibiotics are not working at this stage. It's  showing signs of spreading around your body. It's moved up into your lymph  nodes. It can make you really, really sick, okay? An infection that goes into  your bloodstream is potentially fatal.  <br/>Oh, god! Okay.  <br/>Jeff: So this isn't a case of "Another afternoon,  I'll come check you later in today"?  <br/>I can only recommend for the sake of his leg and his life  that he leave the game now. He needs hospital treatment. It's not going to  get better. It will just get worse.  <br/>Jeff: What can you do?  <br/>I know. Sorry, guys. Bad luck on Johnny. I had this game,  too. I saw the daylight.  <br/>Jeff: All right, let's let you say good-bye to your tribe.  We'll get you on a boat and get We'll get you on a boat and get you fixed up.  you fixed up.  <br/>I'm sorry, guys.  <br/>It's okay.  <br/>We're sorry.  <br/>I couldn't have done everything else. They did everything  they could do. And they've got to take me to the hospital right now. I loved  hanging out with all you guys.  <br/>We'll miss you.  <br/>All right, baby. Take care.  <br/>Jonathan, you take care of yourself.  <br/>We need you. We need you. I need you.  <br/>I'm sorry.  <br/>I really hate to see him go. He was like the pillar of  strength around camp, and, so, yeah, it's... I'm sad to see him go. I only  knew him for, like, three days, but what I knew, I loved him, you know?  <br/>I'm proud of you guys.  <br/>You just kicked ass at that last challenge.  <br/>Have fun, guys. I'll see you at the reunion.  <br/>All right.  <br/>Jeff: Want me to give you a hand?  <br/>I've got it, Jeff. Thank you.  <br/>Jeff: Take it on your own. Hey, hate to see you go, man.  Pleasure.  <br/>Pleasure was mine, buddy. It really was. It really was.  I'll see you later. I'll see you later. I was kicking ass in this game. I  swear to god. I don't want to be out of the game. But I don't want to lose my  leg. Couldn't have tried any better. Couldn't have fought any harder.  Couldn't have fought any harder. It was fun while it lasted. It was fun while  it lasted. It was fun while it lasted.  <br/>Poor Jonathan.  <br/>Poor Jonathan.  <br/>I needed Jonathan, because these girls are driving me  crazy. I'm with a bunch of girls, and I'm not that persuasive in the verbal  manner to woo people the verbal manner to woo people on my side, and they  are. on my side, and they are.  <br/>Two guys.  <br/>If I make it to the merge it's all good, but chances of me  making it are not that... this is not in my favor right now.  <br/>Yay! Hi!  <br/>Hi!  <br/>Welcome.  <br/>Hi.  <br/>Hi.  <br/>Hi.  <br/>Hi.  <br/>When Edwin and Joe came, they brought a fishing line. They  brought an extra machete, a knife, a paring knife.  <br/>Yes, I am.  <br/>That's okay. [ laughs] We can still hang out.  <br/>They brought a fishing net we can cast out to catch bait.  They brought vegetables, fruits-- I mean, just amazing, amazing stuff. We  were thrilled.  <br/>The first thing we'll do, I'm going to set up the bait for  the crab. We'll show you how to do it.  <br/>Yeah, great.  <br/>And then after that, we're  <br/>And then after that, we're going to show you how to fish.  going to show you how to fish. going to show you how to fish.  <br/>I got one.  <br/>I got one.  <br/>Yay!  <br/>I think this is one of the best rewards we've gotten,  because we can actually continually use this knowledge and come out here and  fish in the morning instead of eating just coconuts day after day after day.  It's going to be amazing for us.  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Attagirl!  <br/>Attagirl!  <br/>They're, like, slowing us down. I felt like the challenge  today was us four against the whole tribe over there.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Did you feel like that?  <br/>Did you feel like that?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>...and I lost, I couldn't go back to my job. [  laughter]  <br/>Yeah. We lost the reward challenge today. It's our third  challenge in a row that we lost as the new Malakal tribe. We just don't work  well as a team. And we need the fans to step it up.  <br/>She's like, what, 53? At least 55. It's just... you know  what's getting on my nerves? That not only do you have to play the game, you  have to teach them the game, too. I don't want to teach.  <br/>It's starting to kind of get to me, the fan bashing. Yeah,  they seem slow and they're not doing anything, but you know what? They're  coming around. And we were there once, too. So I'm kind of starting to feel,  you know what? Why not give them a chance?  <br/>I thought about your position, and if we can stick  together and help each other out, then...  <br/>How tight are you and Cirie, pretty tight?  <br/>No.  <br/>When you guys first came to camp, I was happy to vote for  Cirie then.  <br/>I know Erik wants to vote for her.  <br/>Really?  <br/>Who else would vote for her?  <br/>Chet, me, Erik, and you, and then she'd be gone. And I'd  feel better. It's just that she's got such a cute smile and you want to trust  her.  <br/>She's really sweet, but there's that side that's like...  see, that's exactly why I came and talked to you guys. I had the same uneasy  feeling. I'm really conflicted right now. The thing is, I just don't trust  Cirie, I just don't. She screwed me over once when she voted out Yau-Man. And  I feel it coming again.  <br/>I hope so.  <br/>I really trust you.  <br/>You should.  <br/>I really, really trust you.  <br/>Look, I'll look you right... I trust you.  <br/>I trust you, too.  <br/>Okay?  <br/>Okay. Do you feel so much better?  <br/>Oh, my gosh, yes.  <br/>Like a new person.  <br/>Like a whole new person. I'm giving all my trust to  you.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Take care of me. Take care of me, you guys, please,  because I'm really sticking my neck out there, you sticking my neck out  there, you guys. guys.  <br/>I wonder if Jason found the idol. Chet probably got under  that little cave and just stayed there.  <br/>I have the real immunity idol, and after I found the  immunity idol, I decided to fashion a fake one of my own, and I wrapped it  back up and hid it right back where I found it. I really want Jason to find  the fake one, because, from what I've heard, he might be naive enough to  believe that it's the real one and use it in some manner that might end up  getting manner that might end up getting him voted off. him voted off.  <br/>We can just do what we need to do for us.  <br/>Yeah, take your time. I'm just going to go, like, get a  little organized, and then maybe go search or something.  <br/>Okay. That's fine.  <br/>The other day, in one of the challenges, I got a piece of  coral sort of wedged up into my foot, and it really hurts, like, really bad  and it's sort of like an infection. So I feel like I'm at the end of my  tether right now, and I don't it to get any worse or anything. I mean,  obviously my health is more important right now.  <br/>"Clue number one. To progress further go back to the  start. The thing which you covet requires ascension." Chet believes Ozzy  holds the hidden immunity idol already, so I think he's given up on the hope  of finding it. Me, on the other hand, you know, I'm going to keep looking and  see what happens. "Continue your quest by crossing the ocean. You've  done it before, now repeat the motion." Back over. "Two legs rising  out of the sea. Over your head but under a rock." Put on your shoes and  go for a Put on your shoes and go for a walk." walk." Well, I guess  this is the hidden immunity idol. It's not much, but it's a carving of a  piece of wood with a little guy on it. And... this is pretty incredible. So,  you know, I'm going to have to hold on to this tight. This means Ozzy doesn't  have it. I have it, so this is really good for me. good for me. Sweet!  Sweet!  <br/>See that? See that? See that? Come here. Right here. It's  eating now, it's eating. Right there, see? See that? See that?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah. Come here. Come here.  <br/>So where's your plate?  <br/>Right here. My god. It's so good.  <br/>I love garlic, anything in garlic.  <br/>Oh, the fish stew is hands down the best meal we've had so  far. It was delicious. I think we had 25 different types of fish tonight, on  top of all the incredible seasonings that they brought with them, and just  kind of showing us how to do it.  <br/>Oh, it smells good!  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Oh, boy! [ speaking a Micronesian language]  <br/>Bottoms up.  <br/>Bottoms up!  <br/>Bottoms up!  <br/>Woo!  <br/>Woo!  <br/>Woo!  <br/>Jeff: Malakal, come on in.  <br/>Jeff: Malakal, come on in. Airai, come on in.  <br/>He's not on there?  <br/>Where's Jonathan?  <br/>Where's Jonathan?  <br/>He got evacuated.  <br/>He got evacuated?  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>Holy crapola.  <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in Chet and Jason returning from  Exile Island.  <br/>Yay!  <br/>How you doing, Chet?  <br/>Tough days.  <br/>Jason, we lost Jonathan.  <br/>Because of his leg?  <br/>He had to go.  <br/>Jeff: All right, let me catch everybody up. Jonathan  Penner is, obviously, not here. I think everybody here knows that at a  previous challenge, he got injured. The doctors came in to check his  stitches. They saw that an infection had started. They assessed it and made  the decision that it was too risky to let him stay in the game, because if  the infection spread, it would become lifethreatening. They took him to the  hospital, performed surgery, opened up the wound, cleaned it out. He's doing  fine. So we're now even, seven-seven, again. Game continues. Switching  topics. Chet, Jason, did you guys have any time to look for the idol out on  Exile?  <br/>Well, yeah, it was a long time out there. But I kind of  gave up. And the conclusion I've come to right now is that Ozzy has already  discovered the hidden immunity idol.  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy, interesting play going on. Only a few people  have been to Exile, so only a few of you really know the truth about what's  happening out there.  <br/>I don't know if he isn't that good at following clues, or  if someone else has found it. I guess we're only going to find out in the  next couple of days.  <br/>Jeff: All right. You guys ready to get to today's immunity  challenge?  <br/>Yep.  <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, both tribes will use stepping  poles to transfer two tribe members from one large platform to another. All  seven tribe members must then swim out to a final very small tower. First  tribe to get all seven tribe members to the top of the tower with both feet  on or above the top deck wins immunity, safe from tribal council. Losers,  date with me. Somebody going home. We are even at seven-seven. Nobody sitting  it out. I'll give you a chance to strategize. We'll get started. Here we go.  For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! It's a big collision as you've got to  switch lanes to begin. First step, untie the stepping poles. Tracy and Ami  going to be carried across the water for Malakal. Eliza and Parvati for  Airai. Takes a lot of teamwork in this challenge. challenge.  <br/>Okay, I'm on.  <br/>Okay, I'm on.  <br/>Way to go, guys. Slow and steady.  <br/>Jeff: Wow, Airai trying to outthink the challenge, not  using two poles.  <br/>Way to go.  <br/>Jeff: James carrying the pole. The rest of the tribe  keeping it steady. If it works, it is a great strategy. And it does. Eliza is  across. Great idea, great execution by Airai. Not the way this challenge was  designed or the way we thought it would go. Airai going to try it again with  Parvati. Can she keep her balance? Malakal sticking with their plan of using  both poles. They have not stolen Airai's strategy. James is powering Airai to  a huge lead. Airai has-- oh! Oh! It almost worked.  <br/>Wait, she didn't touch...  <br/>No, you're down. You're using the ladder. All the way to  the back. Airai was very close. Parvati fell off at the last second. Got to  go all the way back to Got to go all the way back to the start. the start.  Airai giving it another go. Parvati trying to balance again. Malakal taking a  lot of time, Malakal taking a lot of time, making very little progress.  making very little progress. Airai very close again. Will it work? Parvati's  across. Eliza's across. Everybody to the platform. Malakal still working on  their first tribe member as Airai climbs up the final tower. You've got to  get all seven people on or above the top deck.  <br/>Help me, help me, somebody.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie is losing it. Tracy very close. Can she get  there from there? She is. Malakal has the first tribe member across. They're  heading back to pick up Ami. Everyone in Airai hanging on to James, trying to  figure out how to get seven people on a platform built for five. Immunity at  stake. Malakal now using Airai's strategy. Are they too late?  <br/>Okay, my foot's up.  <br/>One, two, three.  <br/>Jeff!  <br/>Jeff: Airai has it!  <br/>Jeff: Airai has it! Airai wins immunity! Airai wins  immunity! Airai, creative thinking made that a very easy win for you guys.  guys. Come on over and get immunity. Come on over and get immunity.  Congratulations. No tribal council for Airai. Safe in this game at least one  more day. Malakal, tribal council tonight. One of you going home. You have  the afternoon to figure it out. I'll see you at tribal. I'll see you at tribal.  Get in your boat and head back. Get in your boat and head back.  <br/>Well, if he had to have immediate surgery, it's pretty  bad.  <br/>I expected him to go out in, like, a ball of  blazing...  <br/>Blazing glory.  <br/>Blazing glory.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>How are you feeling?  <br/>A fish hook? Why?  <br/>I need to do some surgery on my foot.  <br/>No!  <br/>Look at this. Isn't this, like, a pocket of just  pus?  <br/>I would not open that out here.  <br/>That's what's hurt. That's what it is. I just want to open  it up and get that out and the pain will be gone.  <br/>Don't do that.  <br/>You ready to go, huh?  <br/>Oh, man. Damn. Losing everyone. What is going on, man? We  lost the immunity challenge yet again. And all of a sudden, Chet comes up and  says, "Please do me a favor and vote me out tonight." I was like,  "All right, Chet, we'll vote you out." Was there any question  anyways?  <br/>Dropping like flies.  <br/>Took the words out of my mouth. mouth.  <br/>Craziness.  <br/>Craziness.  <br/>Everything frickin' changes on a dime in this game.  <br/>Chet's injured, he's done. He wants to leave the game by  being voted out, because he thinks that's honorable. But I think it would be  totally more honorable to help Tracy, his longtime friend since he's been in  this game, and myself to get out, like, one of the bigger threats right now.  We need him so bad just so we can get Cirie out right now or Ozzy, even.  Ozzy, even.  <br/>What if Ozzy's got the idol?  <br/>What if Ozzy's got the idol?  <br/>If Chet makes it all the way until tribal and votes, it  would be amazing.  <br/>Chet and I are tight. And I understand he's sick, but it  is imperative that Chet vote with us today. If he doesn't, I'm screwed. But  I'm not going to put his name down. name down. I won't do it. I won't do  it.  <br/>You're just more than ready, huh?  <br/>Come on, guys. I have too much going on right now. And  these last two days have been total hell. I can't even think straight.  Please, that's all I'm asking.  <br/>You could help take Ozzy down, because he's not expecting  it. This would be the craziest play ever in the history of this game if you  helped us do this.  <br/>The target keeps changing. Now Erik and Tracy are looking  at Ozzy, going, "Ozzy might have the idol, he's a threat." And I'm  definitely going to have to deal with Ozzy at some point. So if Tracey and  Erik convince Chet to stay in the game and make a vote, I would vote with  make a vote, I would vote with them. them.  <br/>I know.  <br/>If you did this for us, it would be the biggest gift you  could give us on the way out to just take a little pride. Me and Tracy would  be so grateful. We would be amazingly grateful for that, that you could use  your last dying breath to do something for us in this game. I would be  incredibly grateful.  <br/>Just think about it, okay?  <br/>I'll think about it. Tracy and I committed to each other  from day one that we would do whatever we could for each other, but I've been  having some issues with my foot and some other health issues. I pretty much  told them I would take the hit tonight. But Tracy and Erik have another plan  up their sleeve. They want to use my vote to try to take out Ozzy. I did tell  Tracy and Erik I would think about it, and I will think about it, but to be  honest, I'm not sure what I'm honest, I'm not sure what I'm going to do.  going to do.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie, was there much discussion today about  Penner's exit in regards to how difficult this game really is?  <br/>It just sucks to go out the way he did. I know if he could  have argued the point, he would still be here.  <br/>Jeff: He tried.  <br/>I'm sure he did.  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy, when you see somebody go out like that, what  goes through your head?  <br/>Jonathan is the last person... I thought he was just a  really strong guy. And I've seen him get cut worse, and you don't think a  that little bug gets in you, and, boom, you're all of a sudden out of the  game.  <br/>Jeff: Erik, at today's challenge, Jason made a comment  after going to Exile, basically saying, "I've been there. I looked  around. I think Ozzy has the idol." Did that put any thoughts in your  head?  <br/>What Jason said definitely put some thoughts in my head.  And I wouldn't put it past Ozzy that he found the idol. That's based on  knowing Ozzy.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie, when you hear Jason's comment, do you, like  Erik, believe him at face value?  <br/>No, I don't really take anything anybody out here says at  face value. Jason could have it himself and is trying to throw us off his  track by saying Ozzy had it.  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy, does that concern you?  <br/>I'm not the one going home tonight. I mean, everybody  knows who's going home, so it's not really of any concern. I mean, if I do  get voted off tonight, I will be so blown away and so blindsided that I'll  just get naked and jump off the pier right now. I mean, let's be honest with  each other right now-- Chet's going home tonight. And if somehow everyone is  not voting that way, then I have no business being here.  <br/>Jeff: You wouldn't be the first to be blindsided.  <br/>That's true, that's very true.  <br/>Jeff: Chet?  <br/>Well, the way it's been in every tribal council, there  always seems to be an obvious person but it never turns out to be that  person. So I think there's always going to be that uncertainty, and that mix  of you never know exactly what's going to happen.  <br/>Jeff: So Amanda, coming to tribal council, you have an  idea who you're going to vote for. You may have an idea who a lot of people  are going to vote for. From a strategy point of view, do you think twice  about everything you hear?  <br/>Well I've learned you're pretty much going to be the one  gone if you start feeling comfortable. So I never feel comfortable. And even  though I'm pretty certain on what's going on tonight, you can never be  certain in this game.  <br/>Jeff: Okay, it is time to vote. vote. Cirie, you're up.  Cirie, you're up.  <br/>Thanks for letting us use you to vote out Joel, and I hope  to vote out Joel, and I hope your foot gets better. your foot gets  better.  <br/>I'm sorry to see you go.  <br/>I'm sorry to see you go. Bye. Bye.  <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the  <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has the  hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time play it,  now would be the time to do so. to do so. Once the votes are read, the  decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal  council area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First  vote, Chet. First vote, Chet. Chet. Chet. Two votes Chet. Two votes Chet.  Chet. Chet. That's three votes Chet. That's three votes Chet. Sixth person  voted out of Survivor: Fans Versus Favorites,Chet. That's four, that's  enough. That's four, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need  to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Chet, the tribe has  spoken. Chet, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to  go.  <br/>Love you guys.  <br/>Love you guys.  <br/>Jeff: Well, the good news is you've lasted 17 days. The  bad news is you're down to six. Got to start winning. Grab your torches. Head  back to camp. Good night.

I just felt that's something they can take care of after  I'm gone. I'm very proud of the way I played the game. I may be going out  now, but I lasted a lot longer than some other people thought I would. I am  so honored to be part of the Survivorfamily forever, and it has been a great  experience, it has been a great experience, and thank you again.
