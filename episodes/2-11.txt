<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor: Food was scarce, fishing was  tough. <br/>Rodger: Tina, I got a line hung up. <br/>Jeff: And they were dangerously low on rice. <br/>Jerri: One more meal of rice is all we have we have left? <br/>Tina: At the most. <br/>Jeff: Jerri wanted to team up with Colby for the reward  challenge, but the tribe insisted on drawing names from a hat. Ironically, she ended up with Colby anyway, and they went on to  win the event, and spent a day at the Great Barrier Reef. <br/>Jerri: This is basically the perfect honeymoon without the  sex. <br/>Jeff: Nick won the immunity challenge. <br/>Nick: Yeah, baby! <br/>Jeff: In a departure from previous tribal councils, Ogakor  voted against one of their own. <br/>Colby: Jerri, Jerri, Jerri, that knock you keep hearing on  your door-- it's checkout time. <br/>Jeff: And Jerri was booted from the tribe. Jerri, the tribe has spoken. Seven people left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Amber: Last night, at tribal council, Jerri got voted off. And I think that the group definitely isolated me from their  decision because they thought that I was too close to Jerri. And I felt sad, not only because of Jerri leaving, but I think  more so because it made me feel like my own tribe members didn't even trust  me enough to let me know what was going on. I felt really left out, and I hated that feeling. Good morning. <br/>Keith: I think Amber made a tactical mistake by staying  tight with Jerri. But she was visibly stunned last night that that took place,  too. She didn't see it coming, so she probably felt she lost her big  sister comrade last night, and she's kind of a lone lamb out in the midst of  the rest of us now. And she's a big girl, you know? She made that decision early on, and that's where she sits now. There's nothing can be done about it. <br/>Nick: The mood will probably be better around here. <br/>Amber: This is how much rice we have left to last us 14  days. This is probably enough for one serving. <br/>Nick: This is the closest to a six-pack I've ever had. <br/>Colby: You know, we're in a spot now, but it's not the end  of the world. My gosh, the human body can go days without food. Where the lack of food comes in is mentally. And you've got to stay tough mentally to make it through a food  drought like we have right now. And you can sit around and say, "What if, you know, what if  we were to say...?" Well, we don't have any rice. Woulda, coulda, shoulda. If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we'd all have a merry  Christmas. <br/>Tina: And if we don't catch our food, we won't be eating  any food. Here on out, it's going to have to be everybody working  together, catching crickets, grubs, whatever we can find in order to have  people fishing, and that's no easy task on its own. <br/>Elisabeth: You know, we're starving. We haven't eaten in 24 hours, and we had a lot to do, and no  energy-- none. Everyone here was just in slow motion. You know, I think everyone here would bring back Jerri if we had  rice to come with her. [ laughing]  Keith: Got him. [ laughing]  Keith: Got him. [ laughing]  Keith: Got him. [ laughing]  Keith: Got him. Look at that. You show me Colby doing that. A cowboy can ride bulls and horses, but he can't catch  grasshoppers. Oh, look at that-- it's coming out. <br/>Colby: You know what? I had two grasshoppers this morning, and a frog. But the big ones, you can't even tire those guys out, man. They fly forever and are very scarce, so you can't sneak up on  those. The ones everybody's been fishing with is the little bitty ones,  which are pretty easy to catch. I haven't seen any lately. <br/>Keith: Yeah, I mean, you expend a lot of energy catching  grasshoppers. You chase them down, I mean, you'll run sometimes for 100  yards... not 100 yards. You'll run sometimes for several yards chasing a grasshopper  down, but that grasshopper could mean a, you know, a 15-inch black bream, so  it's very important. There he goes. <br/>Colby: Keith probably has the upper hand on the whole  grasshopper wrangling. A little more experience under his belt. You know, he's been at it a while, and he kind of has a handle on  it. <br/>Keith: Just kind of stun them a little bit. <br/>Colby: I've yet to figure out his method, but I may have  to go to the master so he can teach young grasshopper how to wrangle  grasshoppers. <br/>Keith: Excuse me. I just caught a grasshopper. Kind of important. Oh, no. It's like the 747 of grasshoppers. There you go. I took a wing and a leg off. I was hungry. <br/>Elisabeth: Thanks. I'm close to that. Oh...! A turtle. I hate those turtles. I'm going to try and keep calm. I don't know whether to break this rod or try and eat it. E-mail. "Elisabeth." What is in here? There's, like,...  Amber: Money in there. <br/>Elisabeth: What is this? <br/>Amber: Wait, hold on, let me read the card. "For this next challenge, you'll have to be shrewd, It's  time to find out the real value of food."  Elisabeth: Priceless. "If you don't believe a snack is worth more than gold,  Watch it going once, going twice, and then it will be sold." It's going  to be an auction. <br/>Amber: We all have a certain amount of money to auction on  food. <br/>Elisabeth: Check it out-- money. <br/>Rodger: Wow! <br/>Amber: Yes, it's real money. <br/>Elisabeth: Colby, they could get us some peanut butter. <br/>Amber: But I think we'll all be getting something. <br/>Tina: Wow, I'm excited. <br/>Elisabeth: You guys, we'll get something. [ thunder rumbling]  Jeff: Okay, guys, welcome to the Survivorauction. You each have 500 Australian dollars. Up for bid-- a variety of food items. If you see something you desire, bid on it. I'll tell you what the bidding starts at. The increments are $20. First item-- $60 for four tasty Doritos and a nice big old thing  of salsa to go with it. <br/>Amber: Wow! <br/>Jeff: 60 bucks; Nick? These are the real deal, Tina. I know how much you like Doritos. <br/>Tina: I do, but that's more than $10 a chip. <br/>Jeff: Ouch! All right, going once, twice, sold to Nick for 60 bucks. Come on down. <br/>Tina: Oh, my gosh! <br/>Amber: Doritos, babies! <br/>Nick: 20, 40, 60. Mmm! <br/>Jeff: You can take it back up. Next item-- how about a little dessert? Big old thing of peanut butter, four squares of chocolate. We'll start the bidding at, uh... oh, 80 bucks. <br/>Amber: 80 bucks. <br/>Elisabeth: 100. <br/>Tina: 120. <br/>Elisabeth: 140. <br/>Jeff: 140, Elisabeth. Amber? That's a lot of peanut butter. <br/>Amber: 160. <br/>Jeff: 180, Elisabeth. Going once. 200, Colby. <br/>Elisabeth: 220. <br/>Jeff: $220 for peanut butter and chocolate. Going once... 240. Tina. 240. [ Tina laughing]  Tina: I know that that's something that I...  Jeff: 260, Elisabeth, going once, twice, sold to  Elisabeth. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh. <br/>Jeff: Bring a tear to your eye. <br/>Elisabeth: I would have paid 300 for that. This is my favorite game in the whole world. I'm shaking. <br/>Jeff: Right on. Go back and enjoy. Boy, you are shaking. <br/>Elisabeth: I am. <br/>Jeff: Wow! Mountain Dew. Sold to Amber for 80 dollars. <br/>Amber: Mmm. <br/>Jeff: Sold to Nick-- three crackers for 120 dollars. Sold to Keith for 180 dollars. Take a bite. Sold to Tina. She's on the board. Sold to Nick for 100 dollars. Six French fries, and a big old dish of ranch dressing to dip it  in. Sold to Amber. <br/>Amber: Mmm! <br/>Jeff: Iced coffee and chocolate peanut butter energy bar. A little bit of protein. <br/>Amber: 100. <br/>Jeff: Amber, 100. 120, Colby. 140, Amber. 160, Colby. <br/>Amber: 180. <br/>Jeff: 180 Amber. 200 Colby. We found something Colby wants. <br/>Jeff: 240 Colby. <br/>Amber: Damn you. 260  Jeff: 260 to Amber. 280 to Colby. Going once, twice, sold to movie star for 280. <br/>Colby: We're eating, baby. <br/>Jeff: Big-ticket item right there. <br/>Colby: Plenty more where that came from. On target right there. Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Right on. Anybody got any money left? <br/>Amber: Yes. Yeah, we got a lot left. <br/>Jeff: Good because I've got a nice meal here. <br/>Amber: Hold on, hold on. Is that mashed potatoes I see there? <br/>Jeff: Mashed potatoes, bread, turkey, a little veggie on  there. I'm thinking this is worth a lot at this point. We'll start at 180. <br/>Amber: 180. <br/>Jeff: 180 Amber. 200 Tina, 220 to Elisabeth. 240, Keith. <br/>Elisabeth: Can I get a loan? <br/>Tina: Can you sell me one piece of your turkey and half of  your mashed potatoes? <br/>Elisabeth: Yes. <br/>Jeff: 260 to Elisabeth. Keith owns it at 280. <br/>Elisabeth: Will you give me 20? <br/>Tina: Yeah, and I'll give you 20 more, if you want to go  300. <br/>Elisabeth: I can sell her half? <br/>Jeff: 300 to Elisabeth. <br/>Keith: 320. <br/>Elisabeth: That is all he has. <br/>340. <br/>Jeff: 340-- Elisabeth. Anybody else in on that? One, two, three, sold to Elisabeth. <br/>Tina: Yes! Go, girl! <br/>Jeff: Come on down. $340, yours. Mystery plate. We'll start this at 120. <br/>Amber: 120. <br/>Jeff: 120, Amber. 140, Keith. <br/>Amber: 160. <br/>Jeff: 160, Amber. Thinking about it, Rodger? 180. <br/>Amber: 200. <br/>Jeff: 200 to Amber. Once, twice, three times. 200 dollars for the mystery plate. <br/>Let's see what it is. <br/>Amber: I hope it's good. Gosh, I'll be upset. <br/>Jeff: That's a tall glass of Herbert river water. <br/>Keith: Yes! We read that one right, didn't we? <br/>Jeff: Rodger, I think I have something you may like. You cannot tell me you are not interested in a cheeseburger? <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Rodger: That one's coming up here, son. <br/>Jeff: 200. Rodger? 220. 240, Rodger? 260 Keith. 280, Rodger. <br/>Keith: Three...  Jeff: 300, Keith. <br/>Rodger: How much money you got? <br/>Jeff: 320, Rodger. <br/>Rodger: Let me at it. Oh, go ahead, hit the gavel. I'm ready. <br/>Jeff: Once, twice, sold to Kentucky Joe. All good things come to those who wait. <br/>Rodger: Boy, that is good. Thank you. <br/>Tina: I'm not feeling well. <br/>Amber: I think I'm the only one that's feeling well. <br/>Tina: I can't believe it would go through you that fast. <br/>Rodger: I was feeling sick. I thought I was going to vomit, to tell you truth. I guess because I haven't had hardly any food. And ate the cheeseburger and now I think I'm going to have to  make a trip over the hills to the latrine. <br/>Nick: I got to use the restroom. <br/>Tina: I think that our body is so stripped of any kind of  nutrition, you know, I had turkey and mashed potatoes and some bread, and  it's just... it's just going rrrr, you know, my body's trying to process it  and it's just not going too good. <br/>Amber: I paid $200 for river water. But you know what, somebody had to do it.. <br/>Colby: Here's the deal. You paid 200 bucks for river water and yet you and I are  standing here and everybody else is trying to find paper bark so they can  wipe their butts, 'cause they all have to go to the bathroom. <br/>Amber: And I feel good. <br/>Nick: I'm going to go take a bath, so the whole tent  doesn't smell like ass by the end of the night. <br/>Elisabeth: Mine wasn't that  Nick: Mine wasn't that bad, but I will feel much better  when, I mean, I'm sitting here wiping my butt with leaves. You know, you can only get so much with leaves, I'm sure. <br/>Rodger: Boy, that felt good. Almost as good as eating the cheeseburger. <br/>Nick: Time to get in the river. Makes the ass clean. <br/>Rodger: That's what I was thinking about doing. <br/>Elisabeth: Our systems were just in shock, just absolute  shock. Hopefully that's it for me. As good as it was, I would not take any of that away. I would do it all over again, I really would. Nothing can compare to the food. <br/>Rodger: My leaf had a hole in it, Keith. [ laughter] [ thunder crashing] [ heavy rainfall]  Tina: The water has risen considerably from last night,  and we're losing ground. And we had our flag on the other side of our tent, and I had to  move it because we don't know how much longer there's going to be beach over  there. <br/>Elisabeth: We could have been washed away last night? <br/>Tina: We're probably going to have to move camp today,  actually. Today or tomorrow, no doubt. The water's risen. And it must be flooding upstream because it's quickly  encroaching on us. <br/>Elisabeth: It might as well be a mine field right now, I  mean with the weather how it is. A storm can come and just wash our tent right out. It's right in line with the riverbed where it seemed to be  rushing before. And the river's already crept up, and consumed what we had at  camp. I mean, we crossed that river to get here. It's almost doubled in size. I mean, it's massive right now, and it is coming for us. <br/>Amber: It just keeps on going. Every day, there's something new. Unbelievable. I'm just in shock. <br/>Elisabeth: We're in trouble. We need to move this camp, and my gosh, if I feel how I did  yesterday, if everyone feels how they did yesterday, I can't even get myself  out of first gear. You know, you go from being starving and then going to an  auction and eating, to being starving again. And, you know, that one meal isn't enough to sustain you. It's not. We're still depleted. It's just... it's going to be a rough day, and we don't have  food yet. <br/>Nick: For me, not having food food yet. <br/>Nick: For me, not having food is killer. The lack of energy and the heat and the rain, it's all real. And tomorrow makes a month. And a month is a long time to lay on the ground. I mean I'm 23 years old, in pretty good athletic shape. My back is killing me. You know, I've been sick twice. My mouth is raw. Yesterday, I felt a lot better after I ate, you know, I felt I  could do this for 13 more days. But today, I'm just, like, oh, God, please get me out of here  sometime soon. <br/>Elisabeth: Good call, coach. <br/>Rodger: Ooh, he liked the hook, too, didn't he? That's had a nice one. Look how fat he is. Oh, man. <br/>Tina: Rodger's been out fishing. Elisabeth's been out fishing. I've been out fishing. Has Nick been out fishing? No. He was asked to go fishing, but he said that he's never been  before and he wasn't planning on starting now. <br/>Elisabeth: Why, you know, let your friends work extra hard  because you don't want to get up and move, because you don't feel like  moving? We're all sick here. I mean, we're all weak, and I never thought I'd say this. I really never thought I would, but I'm really disappointed in  Nick right now. I really am. You know, maybe we're the dumb ones. Maybe he's smart, saving his energy and sleeping all day to win  immunity. If we're... Rodger and I are out there, you know, blowing all of  our energy on fishing and Nick is conserving his energy wisely, he's going to  keep winning immunity challenges, and that's going to leave with a vote to  one of us, you know, either Rodger or myself. And that's scary. That makes me mad. <br/>Nick: I feel vulnerable because I still remain a physical  threat to win challenges. I won the last immunity challenge. I'm a big body, so I take a lot to feed. So I'm feeling vulnerable. If I don't win the immunity challenge, I definitely expect to  go. <br/>Jeff: I need to take the to go. <br/>Jeff: I need to take the to go. <br/>Jeff: I need to take the immunity necklace back. <br/>Nick: There you go. <br/>Jeff: Immunity back up for grabs. All right, the ability to start fire quickly, essential to  survival in the outback. Whether it's just to signal a passing plane or to create warmth,  fire skills got to be sharp. For today's challenge, you'll each be assigned a fire scale. On one end, a fire bucket. On the other end, a water bucket. Your goal: create fire in that fire bucket and then by putting  water in the water bucket, tilt the scale to raise the fire high enough to  light a fuse at the top. The first person to light the fuse wins immunity. Here's the hiccup. Your water bucket has a hole in it, so it's going to be a  constant battle running to the river to gather water...  Tina: Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: ...and making sure your fire still has flame. Sound good? <br/>Tina: It sounds good. <br/>Jeff: They're all the same. Pick one and let's go. <br/>Amber: So there's always a catch. It's so funny. <br/>Jeff: Everybody knows where their matches are, right? <br/>Rodger: Yeah. <br/>Jeff: For immunity, survivors ready? Go! Two people going for water Go! Two people going for water Go! Two people going for water Go! Two people going for water Go! Two people going for water Go! Two people going for water Go! Two people going for water Go! Two people going for water Go! Two people going for water already. That-a-way, Rodger. already. That-a-way, Rodger. already. That-a-way, Rodger. Keep cooking, Keith. Don't be deceived. You're making progress. Right now, we've got a lot of fires burning. Ladies and gents, get moving. fires burning. Ladies and gents, get moving. fires burning. Ladies and gents, get moving. fires burning. Ladies and gents, get moving. Hey, hey, hey. No, no. <br/>Keith: Just checking balance. <br/>Jeff: Don't check. I know you guys are getting tired. The good news is your fires are doing great. <br/>Nick: Not mine. <br/>Jeff: Except for you, Nick. <br/>Nick: Too late to stop now. <br/>Keith: Oh, come on, come on, come on. <br/>Jeff: You're getting there, Keith. <br/>Elisabeth: There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza. <br/>Keith: Swing on the pot. Come on. Come on. Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Yeah! No. Stay there. No. <br/>Jeff: You're close Don't slow down. <br/>Colby: Yeah! Whoa! Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Right here, man. Nice work, out of nowhere. <br/>Colby: Come from behind. <br/>Rodger: I've got to have something to eat around here. It makes everybody scared if we don't have a little something. <br/>Tina: Nutritionally, our body is going into shock. None of us are used to being this weak and not knowing really  what to do about it. I know Elisabeth is not doing well at all. She had a very hard time getting up this morning, just making it  out of the tent this morning, I'm really concerned about her. <br/>Nick: Let's take a load off and get some water. <br/>Elisabeth: I'm just going to drink some water. I'm feeling terrible. I mean, but I'm just, like, shaking and weak, and I'm just  frustrated with how I feel. I couldn't even walk up the hill to fish. I mean, I hate not being able to help out and get some food. We need to get rice today. I just want my strength back. I'm just nauseous and, like,... oh, man. <br/>Nick: It's hard to get started in the morning. <br/>Elisabeth: Yeah. We have nothing to sustain us through the morning today. We're praying for fish. We have only two hooks right now. <br/>Tina: No luck. Not even any bites. Rodger got a turtle. <br/>Rodger: He pulled the hook off, so there goes another  hook. <br/>Elisabeth: I'm sorry I couldn't make it out here sooner. I just had a rough morning. <br/>Rodger: Why don't you come back and rest, and then we're  going to go back out in a couple of hours. <br/>Elisabeth: Okay. <br/>Rodger: Only bite I had was that stupid turtle. <br/>Elisabeth: I'm just real low. <br/>Rodger: Yeah, Jeff's here. He's got a big thing of rice. <br/>Tina: He has a bad look on his face. <br/>Jeff: What's up, guys? <br/>Rodger: Is that ours? <br/>Jeff: I come today because I'm concerned, because  yesterday at the immunity challenge, I saw something that I haven't seen  before-- true lethargy, a real lack of energy, especially with Elisabeth and  Nick. You've got 13 days left. And I don't think you're going to make it. So it puts me in an awkward situation, because you had plenty of  stuff. If rationed properly, you had enough rice and you had 25 hooks. You had a tackle box you couldn't improve on. So what happened with the rice? I mean why are you out? <br/>Colby: We just weren't careful with our rations. There's not any one person to blame. We're all guilty. <br/>Tina: We did each lose a bag, too, to condensation in the  can. <br/>Colby: But that's our own fault. <br/>Tina: I'm not saying it's not our fault. But you just asked what happened, and that's part of what  happened. <br/>Jeff: Here's where we're at. My role is a giver and a taker. Nothing comes cheap. I have enough rice to last you your last two weeks here. <br/>Amber: There's so much rice there. <br/>Jeff: But it's not coming without a price, so I need  something back. And I need something of value, substantial value to get this  rice. <br/>Rodger: Blankets. I think blankets would be a good tradeoff. <br/>Jeff: Rodger, I'm talking serious value. You guys are playing for...  Rodger: You're laying there shivering some night, those  blankets are of serious value. <br/>Jeff: We're playing for $1 million. <br/>Tina: Of what we have, what do you want? <br/>Jeff: I'm talking camp. <br/>Tina: Camp? Our tent? <br/>Jeff: Shelter versus food, it's one or the other. Your tarps and that Texas flag. That's what I want. <br/>Amber: You want all the tarps and the flag? <br/>Elisabeth: All the tarps? <br/>Rodger: How are we going to keep dry when it rains? It rains every day. <br/>Tina: We could use rain jackets, the top and the sleeve. <br/>Colby: I mean, shelter, though. That's a no-brainer. I'm talking about my personal item here. I have no problem giving it up. <br/>Jeff: Let me entice you a little more: 25 more hooks. <br/>Tina: Oh, absolutely. You can have the shelter, as far as... my vote is take the  shelter. <br/>Elisabeth: And if we have energy, we can build something. <br/>Jeff: Let's do it. <br/>Tina: Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Amber: Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Who's got the strength to tear it down? I hate to have you disrupt everything, but...  Amber: We need our food, and we need to your strength. <br/>Jeff: Got to have a value. Your tarps and that big old Texas flag, engineered to be a tarp. <br/>Colby: Take care of that, please. <br/>Jeff: I will. Good negotiation, guys. <br/>Colby: Thank you very much. <br/>Jeff: I hope the food gives you the strength to  rebuild...  Elisabeth: It will. <br/>Jeff: ...to get through the last two weeks. <br/>Amber: Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Rodger. All right, I'll see you guys tonight...  Keith: All right, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: ...when we have the unfortunate business of dealing  with the tribal council. So, eat up today. Bye, guys. <br/>Colby: Once we realized that, oh, my God, our shelter's  gone, the first thing we seemed to have to do was get a roof over our head  'cause it really seemed like it was going to rain pretty hard today. <br/>Rodger: It's going to be pouring down rain here tonight. <br/>Tina: We need to start looking for a tree cover. <br/>Colby: Actually, up in this thing would probably be the  best just because there are so many places to lay branches in here. <br/>Tina: The only downside is if the river comes up again. I don't think we need to bring the woods to us; I think we need  to go to the woods. <br/>Elisabeth: Mm-hmm. <br/>Keith: So then it was trying to decide where the shelter  was going to be. And we had a little food this morning but not enough to climb  with a hill and build a shelter up in the hills, that's for sure. <br/>Rodger: We want to come in here with some limbs and angle  them down so it will run as much water off as we can. <br/>Tina: I think it was a fair trade. If we can keep the rains away, as long as it's not a torrential  downpour. We may get wet. But there's worse things in life than being wet, such as  starving to death. <br/>Colby: Hey, Nick, can you bring some of that brush down? <br/>Tina: Think chopping up this chest is good? We're using everything that we possibly can at this point. Every little bit helps. <br/>Rodger: I got some more. <br/>Nick: All right. <br/>Tina: What do you need most of right now? We got grass. <br/>Colby: I need grass and pine, that's it. It's looking solid already. <br/>Tina: Maybe it won't even rain tonight. <br/>Colby: Maybe not. [ thunder rumbling]  Tina: Maybe so. <br/>Nick: Maybe so. <br/>Amber: I feel a couple of raindrops. <br/>Tina: Might as well get used to it. <br/>Nick: These branches are not going to keep us totally dry. It's going to be more waterresistant than waterproof. <br/>Rodger: At least we got food, brother. <br/>Colby: Amber's a little bit brother. <br/>Colby: Amber's a little bit nervous about the fact that we  voted Jerri off. She felt like she might be the next one that we go after. That way Amber won't know anything. <br/>Keith: A smart move. <br/>Colby: It could be potentially deadly for all three of us. <br/>Amber: Can you help me carry this? <br/>Colby: She and Elisabeth have been bonding quite well. She could very easily go over to the guys from Kucha and say,  "Hey, look, I know they're going after me next. I want to jump on with you guys."  Elisabeth: If I were Amber, I'd feel threatened. I mean, if everyone can make Jerri go away, she can just as  easily go away. But by voting Jerri off, Ogakor diluted their power a bit. It didn't seem to be the smartest strategic thing to do. <br/>Amber: Okay, guys. <br/>Elisabeth: And, now, I think they are worried about Amber  approaching us. Amber is kind of a pivot in the whole Barramundi scenario. Bon appÃ    tit. <br/>Tina: That is good rice. It's so nice to have rice again. <br/>Amber: I could approach the Kucha people and go against  Colby, Tina and Keith. And it would be four against three and we could just pick them  off one by one. But how do I know that I can 100% trust the Kucha members, that  they're not just playing with my mind and just pretending to agree with me? I guess I don't know if I can trust Ogakor people, too. They could be playing with my mind, too, but I have to play the  game. And the game's getting harder and harder as the days go on. <br/>Rodger: We need to be heading out. I guess we're ready. <br/>Amber: Let's go. <br/>Rodger: You're not bringing anything, Keith? <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in our jury: Alicia and Jerri. I'll remind you that the jury's not to be addressed. They won't address you. They're merely here to gather information to help them determine  who's going to get the $1 million and the title of Survivor. Okay, first things first. What was the reaction after I left, with all your tarps and your  Texas flag that you guys have food? Tina, did you feel the negotiation was fair? <br/>Tina: I definitely feel like it was fair. That was something that we could rebuild. And even though you took it away from us, it's not like it  couldn't be replaced. And so, to be quite honest, I was grateful that that's what you  chose. <br/>Jeff: Nick, obviously, you came into this a very fit guy. Are you surprised at the toll it's taken on your body? <br/>Nick: I'm definitely surprised. I mean, I stood up today and I felt like I was really going to  pass out. I was waving back and forth and felt bad. And the last three days have been so incredibly tough. <br/>Jeff: Direct question: Colby, anybody here not pulling  their weight? <br/>Colby: No. I don't think so. <br/>Jeff: Rodger? <br/>Rodger: Overall, I think it's... everybody's been pulling  their weight. <br/>Jeff: Amber, how have you grown as a person, being out  here 28 days now? <br/>Amber: I am a lot more open than I ever thought I would  be, and I'm willing to try new things and do new things. And I'm a much riskier person now. It might have taken a really hard experience to learn that about  myself, but I think it's definitely worth it. <br/>Jeff: I want you guys to just take a second and look at  Alicia and Jerri. Slowly the power base shifts from this side to that side. In the end, it comes down to politics. How can you possibly vote somebody out and get their vote at the  end? I just want to remind you of that as we go vote. Elisabeth, you're up. <br/>Nick: My vote is for Keith Elisabeth, you're up. <br/>Nick: My vote is for Keith Elisabeth, you're up. <br/>Nick: My vote is for Keith tonight because, unlike  everybody else, he didn't feel the need to bring his backpack, and that's  just flat out arrogance. <br/>Tina: You seem like a really arrogance. <br/>Tina: You seem like a really arrogance. <br/>Tina: You seem like a really arrogance. <br/>Tina: You seem like a really great guy, but you said you  were tired of playing the game, and that you weren't having fun anymore. So, here's your ticket, buddy. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. I'll read the votes. votes. I'll read the votes. The first vote, Nick. Amber. Keith. Amber. Two votes, Amber. Nick. Two votes, Nick. Two votes, Amber. One vote, Keith. That's three votes, Nick. Last vote... Nick. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Nick: You guys play tough. <br/>Rodger: See you later. <br/>Elisabeth: Bye. <br/>Rodger: Hang in there. Hang in there. <br/>Nick: I hope it doesn't rain tonight. <br/>Jeff: Nick, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Tina: Bye, Nick. <br/>Jeff: For the rest of you guys, I wish for you dry, hot  weather with no rain. You can head back to camp. I'll see you tomorrow. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode, and  hear what Nick has to say. <br/>Jeff: Next time on Survivor:  Elisabeth: This game, in the past three days, has become  drastically primal. <br/>Jeff: Has Barramundi been pushed to the brink, or is their  greatest challenge yet to come? <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God. <br/>Rodger: Our camp is a dry creek bed. I doubt if it's dry right now. <br/>Nick: It's been a great adventure, have some great times,  and some big blows. The last few days have been really rough on me, and it's taught  me a lot about not only my strengths but more importantly my weaknesses. I kind of feel invincible at times, and Survivorhas been a big  reality check for me. It's been a ride, it's definitely been a ride.
