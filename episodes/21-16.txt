<br/> My whole strategy, bro, was to kind of make  people laugh and be all crazy, but it goes deeper than just, "Oh, ha,  ha, ha. Let's keep him around 'cause he's funny. It's like... Hermit crab on my foot. Dude, I hate playing stupid so much, but it's, like, the smartest thing to do  right now. <br/>Jeff: Fabio wins immunity! <br/>I haven't double-crossed anybody on the jury. And I won the final three immunity challenges, and if that's not outwit,  outplay, outlast, then maybe I'm a fool, but right now, I'm feeling like a  million bucks. [cheers and applause] Jeff: Welcome to the "Survivor: Nicaragua"  live reunion show. We're in Hollywood, and a huge reaction from this house at Fabio's victory. [applause] a lot of love. And a very good vote. Very close. First and most important question, Fabio. Did the name stick or did... Because for people who might have forgotten, you  actually started this game as Judson. <br/>And then people ask me, "So what's your  real name? People asked my mom, "Why did you name your son Fabio?" I'm Fabio  right now, yeah. <br/>Jeff: You're still Fabio? <br/>I got a few characters, but, yeah. <br/>Jeff: Here is the question that was most on my  mind as we played this entire game. I could never figure out if you really were a goofball just kind of stumbling  along or if you were playing a bit of a goofball because you figured maybe  that's what people take me for. I'll give them what they're looking for. <br/>Yeah, it comes down to knowing yourself really  well. You can't... Uh... I'm very aware of the vibes that I give off and the way  other people perceive them, and I'm also aware of what I'm getting back and  if there's an imbalance or another... I remember a few times catching  somebody. Just one little look will tell everything, dude. Um... Jeff: What's your family history? How did you grow up? How did you come to be this guy? <br/>Dude, I have been crazy for a while. Really. [laughter] no, a family of artists on both sides. My great-grandfather invented the color wheel on my mom's side. And my dad-- my dad's grandpa, I believe invented the folding card table for  sampsonite. <br/>Jeff: Really? <br/>I have been thinking very seriously about  human creative powers, like in a physical sense almost. And when you're down in the jungle, there is a certain force down there that  you can work with. It sounds a little crazy, but it's there, dude. [laughter] Jeff: And-and so the modeling career, is it on  hold? Do we have any... Put something up if we have anything of Fabio. Because before "Survivor--" oh, there we go. You were modeling, and then you end up with this name Fabio, coincidentally,  and you had the long hair, which you cut. So what's happening? You've got a million dollars. You're 21. What happens tomorrow with your life? Is it going to change? <br/>Yeah. For sure. Yeah. Dude, I-I don't even know, man. I'm going to have a lot of fun. I'm going to start a production company. I mentioned that to you, traveling around and doing music enthocology stuff,  connecting our dots around the world and undermining the government, communications  and art. You know, it's like a corporation. You have 55% of the influence, and you get all these people together. <br/>Jeff: Yes, the entire time we were out there  you were telling me your plan, "If I win, this is what I'm going to  do." Chase, very close, 5-4. Very close vote. [applause] I think the, you know, like Fabio, for me, anyway, there was one  real big question for you. You came off-- even to me at tribal council-- always wishy-washy. Yes-no, red-black, up-down. <br/>I was. I was wishy-washy the whole game. The game drove me insane. Like, I was crazy the whole game. All these people know it; everyone knows it. But for me, like, it's a game where it's strategy, lying to people, stabbing  people in the back. That's the way the game is played. If I'm bad at that and crazy about it I'll take that as a compliment because  it really drove me crazy. <br/>Jeff: Was there anything going on with Brenda  and you because in the beginning, it seemed like there was a little  flirtation going on? <br/>There was, but it wasn't ever like that. It really wasn't. Like, we were just good friends, and everyone took it as the other way. But, I mean, we were just good friends the whole time. We did snuggle together quite a bit, though. <br/>It was a show-mance. <br/>But we didn't take it that far. I couldn't do that in front of my mom. My mom would see that. <br/>Jeff: Sash you had a little something with Brenda  in another way in that you had this really strong alliance for a long time  and your game started to crumble when you lost Brenda and then you lost NaOnka  and Purple Kelly, which we'll get to later. Did you ever think... Did you consider giving her the idol that night? That was the big question of that episode. You were tight together. Why not save her? <br/>Right, well, I think what it didn't show was  the day before when I was on the zip lining reward, which was amazing, I  think Brenda and NaOnka had a little time on the beach. <br/>I made a big plan to take out Sash, and that's  what people don't see, and I told a certain someone. <br/>Jeff: You told NaOnka. <br/>I told NaOnka, the person I thought I could  trust, and she, of course, went and told Sash, so... And I confronted Brenda about it before tribal  council, and I asked her... Pointblank. <br/>Did you conspire against me? <br/>I did, and I said just kidding, but I guess it  was a little too late. <br/>Jeff: So you knew, Brenda, you weren't getting  the idol? <br/>Yeah, but I-I mean, there's still that... Why? I'm gonna go back to the question I asked you at tribal. Why wouldn't you scramble at that point and try to make something happen? <br/>I was still hoping for it. I was going to approach the people that I started the game with, the people  that would want to continue with me versus people who didn't want... Wanted  me out from day one or... So it was Chase and Sash, and I just had to keep on  banking on that. <br/>Jeff: I have to make a public apology to you, Sash,  because during casting, and even the day before the show, I said to Sash  numerous times, "You will be the first person voted out of your tribe,  and when I'm looking at you snuffing your torch, just remember, that's what  I'm thinking." and here you are, in the final. So I give it up to you. You scrambled a lot Thank you. I said I'd see you on day 39, jeff. <br/>Jeff: What's that? <br/>I said I'd see you day 39. <br/>Jeff: Yes. So, Chase, "Survivor" is not your passion. I know your passion, music. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: So give me... There are so many reality  shows now that being on "Survivor" doesn't necessarily change your  life. Has this made it harder for you to do music or has it opened any doors? <br/>I don't think it's done either one. For music, the music industry, you're going to go to nashville, which is  where I live now, and they'll sit there and say, "You were on Survivor? Okay. Can you sing? Can you write?" that's all they care about. They don't care that you're on "Survivor." Yes, they do. <br/>I ain't seen it yet. I mean, that's fine with me. I know the big-time guys in the music industry, jason aldean, kenny chesney,  all those guys, they got there, by fighting to get there and I'm fine  fighting to do that, doing it the way everyone else does it. <br/>Jeff: I want to give you an opportunity. I want "Survivor" to maybe help you in this case. So we've got a guitar here Yeah! [applause] Jeff: So, Chase, give us just a taste of  something that you have written. <br/>All right, we wrote this last week. It's called "Buzz back." we recorded an ep on thursday. That's gonna be out soon, so this will be the first single. <br/>Jeff: Lay it on us Âª 9:00 a.M. Came way too fast âª âª my head's pounding like a dynamite blast âª âª  try to sleep in on saturday âª this hangover sure having its way âª âª  good thing the dogs are playing ut âª âª on the tv âª that's reason enough  for me âª to get a six-pack âª I get my buzz back âª and I'm feeling all  right... Jeff: Wow, Chase sounding pretty good from up  here on the stage. Still to come tonight, one of the most despised Survivors ever, NaOnka. And one of the season's most likable, Jane. Plus, one of the season's biggest underdogs, Holly, and find out how  "Survivor" saved jimmie johnson's life. We are live in Hollywood. It's the "Survivor: Nicaragua" reunion show. [applause] pick it up! <br/>They're playing your song? Âª ain't nothing gonna hold me down tonight... Âª âª gonna pile up âª I'm  calling my buddies... Okay, folks, team huddle! Everybody in this world needs motivation, and I think I can help motivate  this team. <br/>I just got a pep talk. <br/>First time I've ever experienced anything like  this and it's the toughest thing I've ever gone through. I mean, I've gone through three-a-day practices both as a coach and as a  player, I won two super bowls and nothing compares to this. Nothing compares to it. [applause] Jeff: Welcome back to the "Survivor: Nicaragua"  live reunion show. Coach jimmie johnson, what is it... You said in that clip we saw toughest  thing you've ever done, and you're a guy who's done a few things. What is it about "Survivor?" In football practice, you work throughout the  day but you have a soft bed. You have lots of food. You have plenty of water. You know, we didn't have water. We didn't have food. We didn't have a soft bed. We didn't have any sleep. You know, that really played on me more than anything else. At night, you're cold and shivering. You're standing by the fire. It was the most difficult thing I've ever gone through. Now at my age-- now these young kids, they held up a little bit better than I  did. <br/>Jeff: How old are you? <br/>67. <br/>Jeff: 67. You got fame. One would assume you have enough money that you're okay for the moment. Why do this? <br/>I loved the show since day one. I mean, it's been my favorite-- other than football-- my favorite show. You know, I tried to get on this thing about six, seven years ago and got  turned down. My wife, rhonda, did the little video. We filled out all the papers. Did everything. Turned me down. I was just sick. Okay, a couple of years later, went through the whole process, did another  video, sent it all in, I went through all the testing and did all the  physicals, came out to l.A., I'm driving back to the airport, and I got a  phone call. It was the "Survivor" doctor, dr. Horowitz, he says, "Coach, we'd love to have you, but you got two  blocked arteries." he said, "You better see your  cardiologist." a week later, went in, had stents put in, lost 30 pounds. My wife, rhonda, put me on a strict diet, workout routine. My cholesterol went from 220 to under 100. Got healthy. So you might say "Survivor" kind of saved my life. [applause] Jeff: And then you applied a third time. <br/>I got healthy, so now I can be on "Survivor." Jeff: We were glad you're here. I want to talk... Let's go down here in fact. You brought along a buddy of yours. <br/>Oh, yeah, I got my crew. <br/>Jeff: We've got... We've got terry bradshaw  here. Mr. Bradshaw, how are you? <br/>How you doing? <br/>Jeff: Good, pop on up. <br/>All right. <br/>Jeff: Football fans watch you guys every week. <br/>Right. <br/>Jeff: And the back-and-forth. Did you give him a hard time when you found out he was doing the show? <br/>I was in shock that he actually... The first  thing was his age. I was worried he was going to kill himself. That was the thing, really, that bothered me the most. We work out every saturday, watch football all day saturday. We're best friends, and I truly was concerned whether or not he could survive  it. So when he got on... Of course nobody knew he got on it until all of a sudden  he's on it. And then you're like how long is he going to last. And they got him off before he hurt himself. [laughter] Jeff: But, overall, you know, as you say, for  a 67-year-old guy who doesn't have the same drive because he doesn't need the  million dollars... He has the drive. That's where you're wrong. <br/>Jeff: Really? <br/>He does have drive. He loves the show, and I know for a fact he didn't want to go off that show. I know for a fact. He would have liked to have stayed. No, I don't think he could have made it as far as he wanted to go, but driven  he totally is. <br/>Jeff: So based on your knowledge of how he  talked about it, where does this rank for an experience for coach jimmy? <br/>I think outside of the realm of what he's  comfortable with, which is football, this is-- and his lovely wife and his  kids-- right there. This is probably the most important thing he's ever done in his life because  he's talked about this, jeff, forever. <br/>Jeff: Right. <br/>He's talked about this show and we both  thought he was nuts. None of us could do it. <br/>Jeff: You wouldn't do it? <br/>Impossible. There's no way I could do it, no way. It's impossible. Physically, I couldn't do it. <br/>Jeff: Well, we appreciate you coming out. <br/>My pleasure. <br/>Jeff: We enjoy watching you every week. <br/>Thank you, sir. Thank you. Appreciate it. [applause] Jeff: Holly, Holly, going back to you, or  coming to you, you lost your mind those first few days. What happened out there, Holly? Everything started so good, and then the next thing you know, poor Dan has  $1,600 alligator shoes that are floating in the river. <br/>I don't know. It's just... It's so hard to explain. When you get out there, you know, no sleep. You aren't eating. I missed my family horribly. And everything Dan said to me for some reason just really got under my skin. He was constantly bragging about, you know, the price of this, and how many  cars he had, and I was like, "Do you really have to be on  "Survivor?" and I can't explain it. It's so weird. But I do want to make a presentation to Dan this evening just because I felt  horrible about stealing his shoes. I really did. And I heard a little secret that Dan really likes cowboy boots. And after I stole the shoes, he told me that it didn't really matter because  he had 20 more pair of alligator shoes at home. So, Dan, I bought you a full quill ostrich boot for you to take home. [applause] there you go. <br/>Jeff: Dan, what... Holly brings up a good  point. Why do this show? How rich are you? [laughter] well, you talk about it a lot, right? <br/>Well, you know, I don't know who is here, if  the irs is here. You know, maybe I have a lot of money on the side. I don't want to say anything. I'm okay. My two boys are in the audience. And you met matt when he was on the show. <br/>Jeff: Yes. <br/>That was very emotional. And mikey's there, and they were with their two girlfriends. <br/>Jeff: Boy, you just tossed my question aside. All right, still to come. Sprint is going to... We're going to find out later how many millions you  have. Sprint is going to award $100,000 to one of this season's castaways based on  your votes. And later, you won't believe what we're doing for "Survivor" 22. Up next, Jane, one of the season's most liked contestants. You'll hear about the training she did to get in shape and we will hear from NaOnka. She is itching to talk. We'll be right back. Taking us to the break, our composers, david vanacor and russ landau. <br/>They think I'm some middle-aged housewife. They're in for a big surprise. What if I want to beat them? <br/>Jeff: Jane has already won immunity, does not  want to give up yet. <br/>She's a north carolina girl, jeff. <br/>Jeff: Oldest woman in this game going up  against two of the youngest and most fit guys. Jane wins individual immunity. <br/>I may be little, I may be small, but there  ain't no way in hell on an individual challenge you will beat me so...  [laughs] [applause] Jeff: Welcome back, "Survivor: Nicaragua"  live reunion show. Jane, one of the most popular contestants this season, and we just saw coming  in from the break, part of it was just how physically fit you were, you know,  taking out Chase in that challenge. You outlasted some other guys in an earlier challenge. Tell me about the prep did you. I was very impressed when you told us how hard you worked to get ready for  the show. <br/>Well, the staff led me to believe there would  be a lot of professional athletes. So I was like, okay. I'm not going to be able to compete against them so I started running and  doing p90x and total gym and did the chin-up bar and swam one or two miles a  day. Every day I did that. <br/>Jeff: And you also prepped for fire because  you got fire going without the help of anything. <br/>I read an article on the airplane you wrote  and you said, "Why would anybody do "Survivor" without knowing  how to build a fire?" I bought a flint. That was a piece of cake. If you don't have a flint, find other ways. I practiced many a day with my glasses and different material. <br/>Jeff: It really paid off. <br/>It did pay off. <br/>Jeff: What was the animosity with you and Marty? I could not figure out what happened between the two of you that you rubbed  each other the wrong way, clearly. <br/>Day one I tried to make an alliance with him, Tyrone,  and coach and they just fluffed me off. And I was, like, you don't even know what I can do yet, and you're fluffing  me off. And that kind of started it. <br/>Jeff: Marty, did you fluff off Jane? <br/>I'm still struggling with the fluff-off. But, uh... No, she-she made an alliance with Wendy jo. <br/>No, I didn't. <br/>She made an alliance with Jimmy T. We didn't think that was too smart. You look at people and look at their decision-making and you figure out who  you want to hang with. That was it, though. It was just about the game. <br/>Jeff: Would you guys... Are you friends now? Because clearly, you did not like each other on the show. That was not a put-on. <br/>Not so much. <br/>Jeff: Really? <br/>Not so much. <br/>Jeff: So you're not gonna be going to visit Jane? <br/>No, no, no. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. <br/>Jeff: Well, you weren't the only source of  antagonism this season, miss NaOnka. It wouldn't be a great season of "Survivor" if we didn't have a  great villain. This season, her name was NaOnka. [applause] I came all the way out here from south central  l.A., and I will not let anyone stand in my way. I'll push you so hard that damn leg will fly off. One shove, she's out of there. Why you raising your voice at me? I can get loud, too. Fabio, I don't like you. I'm about to vote you off. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka, you a little complicated? <br/>Me? No! Am I? This is just who I am. So whoever don't like it, I don't care what anybody thinks. I'm still the same NaOnka I was before and I'm still going to be NaOnka after  I leave here. <br/>Jeff: You want to go? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Go. [applause] so, NaOnka, is that really you? Is anyone really like that? <br/>When you're playing a game for a million  dollars, you don't know how you're going to act, and I acted a fool. I did exactly what I needed to do to win. And it came across as a villain. And I really didn't think that I was going to be a villain. <br/>Jeff: You pushed a woman with an artificial  leg down. <br/>How I looked at it is I shoved another  competitor. I didn't look at her as someone that has a prosthetic leg because she was  cast just like every one of us. There was nothing really... There was nothing that had me, like, oh, let me  not do this. This is someone I'm against for a million dollars. <br/>Jeff: Kelly, Kelly Bruno, is that fair? Is that fair? You're on the game of "Survivor?" it doesn't matter what your situation  is. <br/>I signed up for the same game. I was going to be held to the same standards. I didn't expect any less. It started out I was offered a free ride on her back at one point, and I  think I took that... I mean I was a little offended by that. I didn't need it. So, yeah, we're playing the same game. I didn't... I didn't take it personally. I didn't try to. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka what's been the reaction at  school? Because clearly, you know, a lot of people come up to me and say, "She's  a teacher? They let her work with kids?" Yes, they do! I still have my job, and I never lost it. And... Have there been parents that have called and  said, "Listen, I'm not so sure about this anymore?" Well, yes. <br/>Jeff: Don't lie to me. <br/>I would be lying if I said no because I'm at  multiple schools. And I've had one of the principals pulled me to the side to tell me that one  of the parents didn't want their kid in my p.E. Class. What I want to put out there is people need to understand this is a reality  tv show and it's a game for a million dollars and this has nothing to do with  my real life and I just want to put that out there. Each and every one of us is up here because we were playing a game to win a  million dollars. We shouldn't be Judged with our profession with this game. I think that's ridiculous. <br/>Jeff: 28 days. 28 days you lasted on this show. You had an immunity idol, which could have taken you to the end. And you quit. <br/>I quit. <br/>Jeff: Why? <br/>I had enough. I had enough, jeff. I just did not think that, you know... If it wasn't for him, I would have  left post-merge when I first had my breakdown because it was just the worst  ever. Like, the first day I'm like, "Where is the helicopter? I'm ready to go." because the weather was horrible. I didn't know that rain forest was going to be a rain forest. [laughter] Jeff: Where is... Where is NaOnka's mom? I want to talk to your mom and find out the truth about you. <br/>Hi, mom! <br/>Hi, NaOnka. <br/>Jeff: Mom, what's your name? <br/>Zina. <br/>Jeff: So, we watched the same show, you and I,  right? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Surprised at your daughter? <br/>No. [laughter] Jeff: The things she said. The things she did. I mean, is that... Did you say, "Honey, go out there and do whatever,  kick ass. I don't care what you do." I did say that. I did. She did a little more than I had expected. I mean, I'm surprised like everyone else, you know. When she came home she couldn't say anything, and every week, from week to  week, I just couldn't believe what I was watching. <br/>Jeff: Does the apple fall far from the tree? Are you a little bit like NaOnka? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: You are. <br/>Part of it. 50%. I'm the good girl, though. [laughter] Jeff: You're the other side. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka, your mom just threw you under  the bus. Well, yes? <br/>I'm mom. <br/>Jeff: You still love her. <br/>Yes, of course I love her. I'll always love her. <br/>Jeff: Well, you will be happy to know, along  with Purple Kelly's parents, that NaOnka and Purple Kelly will leave a legacy  on this show because I want to be clear with everybody here and at home,  starting from this point forward, we will have a rule that says if you quit  this show for reasons other than medical evacuation or some extenuating  circumstances, we will have the right to do what we want, meaning put you on the  jury or take you off the jury. A lot of people... [applause] ...Were coming up this season asking why they  were still on the jury. So thank you for that, Purple Kelly and NaOnka. All right, next season in addition to a new rules change, we have big plans. You're going to hear all about it, and I think you're going to like it. But up next, it is the sprint player of the season, and I'll give you a hint. Naonka, not in the running. We'll be right back. [applause] [applause] Jeff: Welcome back. Well, since thursday viewers have been texting and voting online for the  sprint player of the season. This honor also include a $100,000 cash prize. This year's winner received the most votes ever, and won by the biggest  margin in the history of this award. There is no drama, nobody was close. Jane is the winner of the $100,000 check from sprint. It was a blow-out. [screaming] Jane's daughter, who came out and visited during the loved one. So, Jane, let me ask you a question. What's your annual salary? <br/>Around $50,000 a year. <br/>Jeff: So double... Two years' worth of salary  just for being a likable person. Not bad, and congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: I want to pop around a couple of people. Shannon, I want to give you a chance to redeem. <br/>Redeem what? <br/>Jeff: Well, I think... Maybe not. Maybe I'll help bury you. I don't know. <br/>I was calling the duck a duck. It was quacking like one. It had a bill like one, and I was calling a duck a duck. If it was a chicken, then it became a chicken, but that was his business. I did meet his girlfriend last night... Jeff: Shannon, stop, stop, stop. <br/>I met his girlfriend last night. It was good. <br/>Jeff: What I was referring to-- and clearly a  mistake in Judgment on my part-- Oh, that's where you were going. <br/>Jeff: Was to ask you just about the comment  you made about Sash early in the show being gay and I was gonna actually give  you a chance to say you were just giving him a hard time. But it sounds like you stand by it. That's good. [indistinct talking] Jeff: No, guys, how about this, no. Wendy jo. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Your husband, turns out, was right? He said, with love to you, you would be the first person off. Did he give you a hard time when you got home? <br/>Well, first of all, I didn't tell him. So he had to watch, okay? <br/>Jeff: Nice. <br/>And second of all he didn't guess it because  he said if I sing and I Dance and I talk and I don't go under the radar, I'll  be voted off. So I didn't do any of those things and I was voted off. [laughter] so he was wrong. <br/>Jeff: Well, I'm happy you were on the show. I'm not really sure what you just said, but you are one of a kind. Jimmy t., just a quick question. You were really, I felt, vulnerable when you got voted off. You opened yourself up a little and said, "All right, I can learn."  did you take anything from this? <br/>Yeah, absolutely. I said at the beginning of the game, on one of my interviews, that take  notes, get your paper and pencil. I'll show you how to play this game and just do exactly what I didn't do. I tried too hard. I played with my heart instead of my head and you have to play this game with  your head. <br/>Jeff: And Alina I felt like you had a great  time out there, one of the few people I looked at who I thought was always  laughing and smiling and even when you were voted off, said it's great. I'll come back. <br/>I loved it. I loved every minute of being out there, even the craziness, this woman being  all complicated like she is. Even those moments were just so surreal and awesome and I'm just so glad I  was there. <br/>Jeff: I bring all this up because like it or  not, functional or dysfunctional, getting along-- one thing is true on this  show. After 21 seasons, "Survivor" is a family. You're part of this family now, and we have just added our newest family  member, and I want to come down and talk to the dad. We've had a couple of love affairs come from this show, probably the most  famous love affair is boston rob and amber. [applause] what's up, buddy? <br/>How you doing? <br/>Jeff: They met on "All-stars." they  fell in love. Amber won. Rob won her heart, and you just had your second baby. <br/>We did. [applause] Jeff: So this is an amazing story. There's a picture of carina. Give us the short version of what happened with amber. <br/>It was pretty dramatic, like everything that  goes on in our household. We got to the hospital at 2:15 in the morning. Amber had the baby at 2:25, no iv, no epidural. I mean, just she just got it done. <br/>Jeff: There was a moment where you literally  were whispering in amber's ear, "You've got to push right now,"  because there were some complications. <br/>Well, the head came out, and like I said, we  got to the hospital very late. We live about 40 minutes away. We were rushing there. And the doctor said, "Now's the time." I reached out. I went to her ear and told her we got to get it done. <br/>Jeff: That's why you guys are a great team. Why you worked so well on "Survivor." rob, you take us to break. Get us out of here. <br/>After 21 seasons the greatest adventure game  on television is about to evolve once again. It's big. Find out all about it when we come back. <br/>Jeff: Nice job! [applause] Jeff: Welcome back to "Survivor: Nicaragua"  live reunion show. Before we get to our big twist for next season, I want to share with you an  experience I had this summer in Nicaragua. During a break in shooting, I visited an operation smile mission where I got  to see firsthand how quickly a child's entire life can be changed. 45 minutes, these kids have a new smile, new self-esteem, new outlook, and a  new future. It is an amazing thing to witness. You can visit operationsmile.Org and see for yourself. This year's "Survivor" auction will benefit operation smile. If you want to own a piece of "Survivor" you can bid on items from  the show. Go to ebay.Com/Survivor. We are heading into our 22nd season of "Survivor." and we're doing  it with a twist that will change the game. For 21 seasons, Survivors lived by one simple rule: When someone is voted  out, they're out of the game. Their shot at the money is gone. But that's about to change. This time, when someone is voted out, they're not going home. Instead, they'll be forced to live alone on redemption island. When the next person is voted out, they'll be sent to redemption island as  well. And the two will square off in a head-to-head duel where the only way to stay  alive is to win. One person will survive long enough to re-enter the game for a shot at  redemption and the million-dollar prize. Those who voted them out may not be so happy to see them back. It's the biggest twist in "Survivor" history. Creating new obstacles, forcing new strategies. Who will have what it takes to outwit, outplay, and outlast all the rest? Find out this february. "Survivor: Redemption island." [applause] All right, so let me explain how this works. This means that when the show starts, everybody knows here are the rules. When you're voted out, you're not out. You will go to redemption island. So what will happen... Mike, give me a shot... We have some former Survivors. Find somebody. Okay, cirie, very popular. So imagine it is cirie's season and she's playing and she gets voted out, and  you think, man, I wish cirie were still on the show. She will still be on the show. She'll go to redemption island. She'll have the same supplies that everybody else in the game has she'll for  the next guy. Who else have we got? Rupert shows up. Now rupert and cirie are living together on redemption island. They get into a little duel, the winner is still on the show, the loser is  out, and then we go and continue this on and on. I'm telling you, it's going to be good. If you want to be on "Survivor" cbs.Com for the details. Fabio is going to get a check for $1 million tomorrow morning right on the  "Early show" on cbs.
