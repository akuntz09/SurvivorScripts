<br/>This time i'm playing like a  criminal. If you say anything about us talking, you're a dead man. There are  small windows of opportunity in this game, and if you miss them, you're not  going to win. I’m swore to myself i'm gonna make big moves. Don't you think to  be in with the enemy could be a good thing? I’m made moves that other people  were scared to make. I’m will give you my advantage. I’m made moves that I’m was  scared to make. You know what, Jeff? I'm going to use my advantage. And it  worked. [ cheers and applause ]  Jeff: Welcome to the "Survivor" live reunion "game  changer" season where Sarah has just won $1 million. Congratulations on  a really nicely played game. [ cheers and applause ] hey, before we get into  you, glenn, give me a big shot of everybody. I’m just want to say thank you  to all you guys because this really was a great season, and to give up what  you give up and to do what you have to do with your families and your jobs  and your livelihoods and to come out here and play, thank you very much. It  was really fun. [ applause ] all right, so, Sarah, I’m think one of the  biggest, really biggest game-changing moves of the accept for you was your  very simple-- your switch of philosophy from cop to criminal. And what I’m thought  was really interesting is you ended up playing a lot like your former  adversary, Tony. Did you find some truth in that?  Right, so, in cagyan, we saw how that worked out for me and how it worked out  for Tony. I’m had a front-row seat to watch Tony play so masterfully. And he  was so successful at it --  was he really a mentor in that sense?  Absolutely. And what people don't get about Tony is the guy called me at 5:30  in the morning every morning prepping me for the show, but he was, like,  trying to prep himself. And he's like, "get up, you bum." i'm  like,"it's 5:30, dude." he's like, "yo, sara, we've got to  talk."  Jeff: So he was trying to help you.  Yeah.  Jeff: I’m have another question.  Sure.  Jeff: You said something that continues to baffle me that Survivor is a game  by definition outwit, outplay, outlast. As Tai said, it's about deceiving.  How do you do the sleight of hand with emotional and social politics. And you  said I’m had to get permission from my friends. Why is that so important for  people to know their friends will know unemployment i'm not this person.  So nobody wants to go out and make their family, their friends, ther  profession look bad, so the first time I’m played, that weighed heavily on  me. In order to come out and be successful, I’m had to let that go. I’m was  given the right of way by everybody, and I’m just came out guns a-blation  because the gates were open for me to do whatever I’m had to do.  Jeff: Knowing they would love you.  Knowing they know who I’m am. And in fact, they kind of beat me down for not  being more like that the first time. So yeah. It was really nice to have  their blessing to come out and play this way. Even though I’m hurt a lot of  people oop. It's not easy to watch back. I'm very proud of the game I’m played.  I'm not proud of how I’m treated people.  Jeff: Well, you can't have it both ways. That's a whole other discussion.  Right.  Jeff: That's one of the things "Survivor" shows is you have to own  it because the jury will hold you accountable. Culpepper, it comes down to  one big decision. I’m was watching with friends backstage and they were  rivetted with the decision being made among the four of you, who is going to  go to the jury-- in this case Tai-- and who is going to go to the final  three. You said as you're voting Tai out, and you said in the show, "i  feel like I’m can beat anybody." so I’m just want to walk through that.  Here are the votes. Glenn, show the votes of the tribal. We don't normally do  this. Let's see who everybody voted for. Because what i'm wondering is, did  you miscalculate?  Clearly [ laughter ].  Jeff: But, no, specifically dyou miscalculate the bitterness that you thought  the jury might have toward what Sarah just said, which is hurting their  feelings.  I did. But first, clearly let me say this. I’m clearly needed a snickers out  here, I’m love this guy right here, and I’m hated watching that, being the  bully. Tai, I’m love you. And we had a complicated relationship. [ applause ]  Tai, we were together. I’m was frustrated. And it came across terrible. And I’m  apologize. That is awful.  Oh, no you don't need to apologize. It's a game. You've been a great guy.  I love you.  Jeff: Culpepper. No, no, no. This is perfect. Let's forget what I’m just  asked.  Okay.  Jeff: Because, stay with with me. Stay with me. That emotion that you just  talked about "i was so frustrated with Tai. Of.  Yeah, I’m was.  Jeff: Had an impact in you voting Tai out, right?  Yes.  Jeff: So now you miscalculated with sara, clearly. She won, right?  Yes, yes.  Jeff: Let's see what would have happened. Let's play a pretend game.  I don't like that game.  Jeff: But I’m love it.  You know what, when you're out there --  i want to play this game. Culpepper, come oit's fun. You like games. But  what?  The feeling you have out there, even the perception of the jury out there, is  much different than it would be now.  Jeff: I’m understand that. I’m trust the jury to be honest with me. Just go  with me. This is what it's like at tribal with any culpepper. Monica or Brad.  [ laughter ] okay, so, Sarah, you're on the jury. Tai, you're in the final  three. Of the people--  no, i'm four.  You're final.  Jeff: Come on, guys.  If I’m had cut you like, that you wouldn't have vote forward me.  Jeff: Culpepper, will you just stop for a second! [ laughter ] so everybody  that's in the jury, including sara, but not you, Tai, because you're now in  the final three. Who would have vote forward Brad? How many people. Okay.  You're not in the jury, Troyzan! Hold your hands up! Hali, Debbie, Zeke, Sierra,  Andrea. So that's five votes. The other five would you have voted for Sarah--  I’m mean Tai?  Yeah, I’m think so.  Jeff: Okay, so five-- okay, so this is something we've never talked about,  and it's a perfect time. Everybody asks, what, would do you in the case of a  tie at final tribal? We would have had one had you said "you know what,  i'm going to keep Tai and get rid of Sarah." we would have had had a  tie, 5-5. This is the rule. Hs what would have happened in a future season.  The person who was not in the tie. We have Brad with five, Tai with five. Troyzan,  you go to the jury and decide the final vote.  Wow!  Jeff: So, Troyzan, in this case-- [ applause ] [ cheers and applause ] Troyzan,  in this case, honestly, back then, not watching the show, when you were in  that moment, who would you have voted for?  Tai, say it.  If it was Tai or Brad? Brad. Brad.  Jeff: So, culpepper, I’m bring this up because-- and you guys are-- are  making it difficult to make this point. [ laughter ] but I’m believe the  jury's telling the truth. And the reason i'm bringing it up is it shows how  hard this game is. You actually did play a game good enough to win. And one  decision will haunt you. You made one wrong decision.  Oh, no.  Jeff: It will haunt you because I’m will be staying to you all the time.  Anyway, that's how tough this game is. [ applause ] let it go. I'm moving on.  And it's not lost on me, Sarah, that the-- the-- no, that the nuanced way in  which you maneuvered that knowing what needed to happen shows your social  play at work. Brilliant. Tai, why is this game so hard for you emotionally?  What is it?  Oh, my God. I’m think it's just in my nature. It's so hard story me to-- it's  easy to be nice and kind and take care of people. Brad does a lot at camp. He  cares for the camp and everything else. It's just, I’m don't know, I’m go  into this game. I’m say it's eye game. Somehow out-- I’m always get what I’m want  outside of the game, I’m slowly can manipulate people to get what I’m want.  Somehow, in some game, it just seems bigger-- I’m just --  but why is it emotional? To Sarah's question, why do you need to always be  kind and nice? If your friends gave you permission to lie, would you be able  to?  I give myself permission to lie. On the show itself, it's notably to do it. I’m  go to my heart instantly. There are so many chances I’m feel I’m should be  playing the idol and I’m don't. I’m know I’m feel comfortable in the game. I’m  know how the game is going. And smowrk I’m don't know. It is just really  hard-- it's just not in my nature. And I’m hope I’m grow from it. If you ever  want me back --  i love hearing that. Cirie, I’m have to go down to you. We saw the reception  you received earlier. [ cheers and applause ] Cirie, so, I’m think this is a  question I’m sincerely am interested in. What do you think it is? Like, I’m would  always say about you,"well, she's the woman who got up off the  coach," which meant to me, you're the woman who thought, "could I’m  do that?" what do you think it is about you? What do you represent?  You know, Jeff, I’m think that because I’m have, like-- or I’m have had so  many insecurities about myself-- i'm my hardest critic. And I’m don't come in  to any situation judging anyone because who am I’m to judge anyone? And I’m think  because I’m am not up here like a big athlete and i'm not, like, a crazy  challenge beast, i'm more like everybody else at home. So i'm easy to relate  to. I'm not threatening to anyone. What am I’m going to do, Jeff?  Jeff: So you're arguingure you're the every person in that sense? Let's boil  it down to its essence. There are people who have been watching like you for  years and years debating, I’m should do it.  They should absolutely do it, Jeff. Do you remember the last time you asked  me that 12iers years ago. I’m said stay on the couch. Get off the couch and  go out and do it.  Jeff: What does it make take? What is the ibgreedient for a good player? Just  philosophically.  You have to be able to connect with people on a general person-to-person  level. You have to listen and hear what these people have to say. You have to  learn about their families. You have to learn about their fears. You have to  learn something about these people to relate to them. If you can't israel to  them, it's like talking to a brick wall. You're never going to get their  vote.  Jeff: All right, well, we have a lot to talk about tonight, including one of  the biggest moments in any season of "Survivor." it made news  around the world. People are still talking about it. I’m think it's fair to  say it was a cultural milestone when Zeke was outed as being transgender.  Why haven't you told anyone you're transgender?  Jeff: Zeke, and Jeff Varner are next. [ applause ] I’m didn't wanna be like  the trans "Survivor" player. I’m wanted to be Zeke the "Survivor"  player.  And you are.  I feel like I’m am.  You are. . [ applause ]  Jeff: Well, it was one of the biggest game-changing moves of all time on any  show anywhere and it became a worldwide cultural moment. It started so many  conversations. It brought awareness to what it is to be transgender. I'm  still hearing from families who said it gave them an opportunity to talk to  their kids about it. And every single person agrees on one thing and that is  how amazing Zeke was in the moment. [ cheers and applause ] Zeke, I’m know--  I’m know this isn't-- even though you're being celebrated, it's not something  you celebrate. But take us back to that moment just in terms of what was  happening for you emotionally as it was unfolding.  Right, well I’m was really scared. Because I’m didn't know what was going to  happen to my world. I’m didn't know what the reaction was going to be. And  you're growing up in oklahoma, I’m didn't always have a lot of friends. And  even throughout my lives, people haven't always stuck by my side through the  hard times. But what this experience has shown me is I’m have so much love in  my life. [ applause ] my friends are here tonight, and they were with me that  night. And my friends are a big part of my family, and I’m did not get  through this without them.  Jeff: So you watched with them at home.  Yeah, I’m did. And I’m never felt as loved as I’m do right now.  Jeff: You know, one of the most challenging moments for me was telling people  that the metamorphosis moment wasn't scripted. This is an unscripted show.  Because it was such an amazing moment for you to grab that word and pull it  into the conversation. So what, in terms of metamorphosis, what has this  experience-- where are you now with it?  Yeah, well, i.  -- so. When I’m transitioned, I’m was hit with a pretty big bowpt of  depression, like a lot of people are. And i-- I’m almost failed out of  harvard. I’m was living at home. I’m was alone. I’m was pretty hopeless. Ask  &amp; I’m started watching "Survivor." and I’m binged 20 seasons.  It &amp; it took me away. I’m got to go on adventures with Ozzy and Cirie and  Sandra. And it got me through. And slowly I’m put my life back together. But  there was something missing, a courage and boldness. And something inside of  me knew I’m had to go play "Survivor." and I’m found that boldness  in fiji, I’m found it on the beaches. And in so many ways "Survivor"  has given me my life back.  Jeff: Sara, at least for me, when I’m was watching it, the other necessary  half of the equation for change to happen is what you said which is,  "here I’m am, somebody tristate midwest, not exposed to this, ands I’m see  you as Zeke, and I’m love you as Zeke." what was the reaction to your  friends when they saw how you had handled it?  So I’m was a little nervous how my state would react to it. And everybody's  been so positive. And, you know, I’m talked to my dad about it, before the  show happened. And he was like, you know, i'm so proud of the way that you  handled it." and then my grsms the one that I’m was really concerned  about. And when we got out here, well, first of all,.  When voted Zeke out, she scolded me for it. She says, "he gave you his  jacket!" and i'm like, "i know, but" --  so they were accepting.  Yeah, absolutely. And when she got out here, he was the one person she wanted  to meet and she got to meet him yesterday.  Jeff: Oh, good. Oh, nice. Well, Zeke, since then. Man your world-- you have  been writing-- one thing you have been writing a lot for the "hollywood  reporter."  yes, I’m love to write. There's a great team at the "hollywood reporter."  it's been incredible and i'm so grateful for the platform they've given me.  Jeff: And you're working with another platform, glad.  Yes, I’m partnered with glad, particularly nick adams of the director of the  transgender media program. At the core of glad's philosophy is authentic  l.g.b.t.q. Representation accelerates acceptance and saves lives and that's  why i'm so proud to be part of "Survivor" and cbs because you have  always empowered me to speak authentically and to tell my story on my own  terms. And I’m feel likure partnership is the model for how trans stories  should be approached in want media going forward.  Jeff: very cool. Thank you. You know, I’m loved that-- because I’m feel a  little bit for you that there's this pressure of expectation which I’m know  you're taking care of and you're doing your part. But I’m am glad to hear  that you're also using this-- because you're a great storyteller. You're  compelling-- that's why we put you on the show. So i'm glad you are giving  yourself permission to pursue your own personal dreams and not feel limited  to having to talk about this all the time. So if this is a perfect world,  before we get to Jeff, in a perfect world, what comes from this?  Well, I’m think for me, I’m felt that I’m was somehow limited because I’m was  trans. That there were things they couldn't do. And I’m don't be that  anymore. So that shattered that for me. There were dreams they buried that I’m  think are alive again. And I’m also don't want any young trans person to  believe they are in any way limited. And in the meantime, the journey might  be harder, but the adventure is so worth taking.  Jeff: Awesome, great, I’m love that. So the other person in this cultural  moment was Jeff Varner, who took a lot of heat, deservedly so. But since the  episode, Jeff, you have been really public in owning your mistake. You made a  post on your facebook page, I’m think where you talked about it. We all know  what the reaction was that night. I'm curious, what has the reaction meant to  you since people have seen you saying, "i am sorry. I’m shouldn't have  done it." how are they receiving you?  Well, this has been a very difficult situation for both of us, and I’m don't  ever want to talk about my journey without acknowledging the in fact that the  real journey in this situation has been for Zeke. This has been very  difficult. I’m got hit hard. We knee we would. You told me I’m would,  "prepare yourself" and it was really ugly for a period of time. And  then it changed. And I’m was told the way they reacted and the way I’m handled  it-- i've always been taught to stand up and admit your mistakes and own them  and turn them into something positive, and I’m did that every minute of every  day. And-- [ applause ] i've heard that from everybody. And i'm --  so what do you do with that?  As much as he is happy about the love in his life, I’m am thrilled with the  support in mine, and it will ultimately be a good thing. I’m got fired,  cowardly. But keller williams, the number one real estate agency in the  country hired me and i'm so proud of them. Business has been great.  I love that, Jeff, well handled.  Jeff: Well, thank you very much. It was-- it was very hard transition to make  this one because that was powerful and amazing. This was tiny but  interesting. It was a little moment. You might have seen it in last week's  episode. Take a look.  This is a "Survivor" classic, last won by cochran. Set a record. 17  minutes.  My boyfriend.  Jeff: Got a little crush. This could be the beginning of a little "Survivor"  love affair. Break this record, you might win his heart. Could we have a new  "Survivor" couple? Plus, she rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, Michaela  did. Should she immature or just misunderstood. She's one of my favorites, Michaela.  Next. We'll be right back. I'll circle back. [ applause ]  Jeff: Welcome back to the "Survivor" live reunion show for  "game changers." Aubry, this isn't a big thing but you brought it  up. I’m didn't say anything. You were tweeting about cochran. And I’m know  you have a boyfriend, but is this-- what is this, a tv crush? What is this?  I was crestfallen when Debbie goes and steals my mine, but everyone has a  crush on cochran. Like, who doesn't? You do.  Jeff: I’m have a cochran crush. That's true. Fair enough. Where's Sandra. Sandra.  [ cheers and applause ] this game, it seems so easy for you. It's really just  a simple question-- is it as easy as it appears?  It's a job to me. I’m have 39 days to go get my million dollars, and i'll do  whatever to whoever to get to the end. That's my job. [ cheers and applause ]   Jeff: Michaela, what advice-- I’m watched you play twice. I’m love you. I’m know  how caring and empowering are you about-- all these things that other people  are going, "Michaela? You're talking about Michaela?" watching  yourself now back to back, what advice do you give to Michaela?  My advice to me is recognize that the outplay part of the game is not just a  physical thing. It's about responding to the situation you're put in, in this  game, and learning how to do it with grace, with style, with finesse, when  you need to, and in your face when you need to, but without isolating  yourself.  Jeff: Did you find that million dollar-- you were so blinded by rage,  literally, as a metaphor, you didn't see a million-dollar opportunity.  I'm checking the stump right now. [ laughter ]  Jeff: Sierra, question-- I’m got this question a lot. I’m have two quick  questions for you.  Okay.  Jeff: We're liefg, we're running out of time. But why-- like, you tell Sarah,  "i have a legacy advantage." and everybody goes, "why did you  tell her!" why do you guys feel the need at times to share the most  important thing in the game, information?  Right. I’m at that point made the biggest mistake you could make in "Survivor"  with my heart. I’m was sitting with her. I’m was being honest with her. I’m was  being vulnerable with her. I’m had just seen my father, and I’m was in a  weird place and thought I’m could be honest with somebody was aligned with.  Jeff: It's ultimately trust.  I trust her 100%.  Jeff: Malcolm, when you come out and do everything you have to do to get into  this game and you're blindsided in a crazy tribal, honestly, how hard is it  to recover from that?  You cry for a few days. No, we've all done this before. We know how  unpredictable it can be. All the winners are sitting in the back row this  season. But that's part reason why we love playing it. It's that much fun.  It's why millions of people love watching it. And that's why 17 years later  it's still the greatest thing on television.  Jeff: Ozzy, as we go to break, you seemed to really be a great spokesperson  in terms of whether or not you guys like the new tribal format, the q &amp;  a.  You know what? I’m think Survivor is such a beautiful microcosim for the  world. And we all come together. And the game-changing theme for the tribal  council, to have this open forum, to bring us together, to really express  these ideas that's correct different ideas and bring our different walks of  life. It's a beautiful microcosm, and I’m think it's really amazing that it  allowed us to actually choose the right person that won, Sarah. And it's a  microcosm for the rest of world that we all need to unite as a people to  change the way the united states is going. And we need to make better  decisions on how the united states is run. [ cheers and applause ].  Jeff: All right! Well othat note! As one season ends, there's only one  question to ask, "what's next?" we'll show you, be right back. Âª âª for our 35th season, "Survivor" returns  to one of the most beautiful places on earth, fiji. And for the first time  ever, we'll divide the tribes based on the positive traits most often  associated with them by others. Heroes. They are heralded for their courage,  their achievements and ideals for which they stand.  To be a marine is honor, courage, and commitment. Your job is to serve the  country and protect the country. You're not looking for praise for what you  done and who are you. You're just doing your job.  Being a life guard, when you run in the water to save someone's life, your  adrenaline is going, your heart is pumping. But out here here it's either  sink, swim, or get out of the ocean. For the first time in my life i'm going  to let people sink.  Jeff: Healers, they receive grat feud tooud for their acts of service and  helping people heal their emotional and physical pain.  I'm a surgeon that deals with a stressful situation on a daily basis. So when  you put me in a situation like, this i'm not going to freak out. I'm going to  come in here with surgical expertise and carve my way up to the top.  Physical therapy is very giving, and it's about other people. This is a very  selfish game, so it's time to be selfish and any opportunity to show i'm  tougher than you, stronger than you, smarter than you, i'm all for it.  Jeff: Hustlers, they are respected for their work ethic, get it done no  matter what. They stop at nothing to achieve their goals.  I'm a personal assistant. I’m do anything and everything, and there's a lot  of stuff in "Survivor" that you have to do that you normally don't  want to be doing but you gotta get it done. And i'm used to doing the job  that nobody else wants to do.  Working as a bellhop, i'm 125 pounds soaking wet. It's so tough, but i'm more  athletic than I’m look, and I’m go to sleep thinking about "Survivor."  and now i'm ready. I’m love turtlenecks. I’m don't drink and I’m don't have a  girlfriend. Come on, who wants to align with me?  Jeff: Three very different approaches to life. Once again will be tested in  the greatest social exphermt on television. It's "Survivor: Heroes  versus healers versus hustlers." cbs this fall. [ applause ].  Jeff: We'll be right back with "Survivor: Game changers" live  reunion show.  Jeff: It is th the "Survivor" live reunion show. Jeff Varner you  said something to me during the break you wanted to add.  I have been living in shame for a year and I’m just came through it and. There's  a book i'm working on titled "surviving shame" and you gets the  first copy.  Jeff: If this adventure, all of it, everything we talked about in the last 34  seasons seemed fun and you want to play "Survivor," first step, you  have to show us who you are. If you want to bid on props from this season go  to Survivorauctions.com. Proceeds go to stand up to cancer. Yeah, kick in  that music, because I’m want to say this from my heart. Thank you for your  loyalty! Thank you for staying with us! [ cheers and applause ] we love our  jobs, and we'll continue to try to give you great "Survivor"  seasons. Good night!
