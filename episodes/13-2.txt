<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor... Get overboard. 20 strangers were divided into four tribes-- Puka, Aitu, Raro and Hiki. <br/>Watch it! <br/>Different ethnic groups. Is that kosher? <br/>I'm a little bit worried that it might play out to caricatures and  stereotypes. <br/>The Hispanics all come from Caribbean or South American background. We're used to being in this tropical setting. <br/>Probst: But at Aitu, Billy quickly found himself on the outs...  He didn't really know what he was doing. <br/>Probst: ...forcing Ozzy to step up. On Puka, Cao Boi resorted to some traditional healing. <br/>There, you'll feel better now. <br/>It looks like it burns. <br/>I've never been accepted by the Asian community. I just don't fit the stereotype. It's a very dangerous position for me to be in. <br/>Probst: On Hiki...  One person get firewood, one person get bamboo. <br/>Probst: ...Sekou stepped up the lead, but the tribe became frustrated. <br/>He likes to take a lot of breaks and we've got too much to do. <br/>Probst: At Raro... ( screaming )  Ah, no! <br/>Probst: ...Jessica let the the tribe's chickens escape. <br/>I am so sorry. <br/>I'm not happy with Flicka. I can forgive her, but I don't have to forgive her. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge... Puka wins the challenge! ...Puka, Aitu and Raro won immunity and flint to make fire. Hiki was not so lucky. No fire for you; somebody going home. But a surprise was revealed. The losing tribe will choose one person from any of the other tribes to go to  Exile Island. And the two men from Hiki chose Jonathan. On Exile Island, Jonathan searched for the hidden immunity idol. <br/>A cold, miserable, shivering... Exile Island is really terrible. <br/>Probst: Before tribal council, the women and men of Hiki were divided. <br/>They're in threes. They're going to try to vote one of us off. <br/>They're stupid if they do that. <br/>They're stupid. <br/>The ladies and I are thinking Sekou might be the right person to vote out. <br/>Them two are like peas in a pod. <br/>Probst: Sekou tried to convince Stephannie to vote with the men. <br/>Sundra and Rebecca, they're very close. The guys are very close. So, of course, I'm the swing vote. <br/>Probst: At tribal council... the first person voted out of Survivor: Cook  Islands... Stephannie stayed true to the women and Sekou was the first person  voted out. Sekou, the tribe has spoken. The good news is you now have fire. 19 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION ( theme song playing  )  We need fire so bad. We're like on day four, no water. We're just kind of like... we're beat, you know? <br/>It's sparking. That'd be something. <br/>Is it the wind, you think? <br/>We were all a little disheartened. We want to represent well, but we're feeling a little bit added pressure of  being the African-American tribe. <br/>We tried, and we just couldn't get it going. I don't understand what we're doing wrong. We should have fire, but that's not happening. <br/>We're going to make this fire. It is absolute desperation time. We've got to do it now. <br/>All right, I'm going to try it. <br/>Guys, it's lit. What do we do now? ( laughter )  We've got a fire. We've got a fire. Whoo! The fire was started by Rebecca. Girls, I knew they were all going to step up and really be, like, some tough  sisters, and that's what they've done. And I'm so happy. Burn, baby, burn! <br/>This has been a great day for our team. We're figuring it out and working as one team. And I couldn't ask for anything more. <br/>The Aitutaki tribe is doing really, really, really well. This morning we went and got fish together, and we captured like eight, nine  fish and got seven or eight clams, big ones. <br/>Yeah. <br/>All right. Look at our bucket. <br/>Latinos are good workers. It's kind of in our blood, it's in our heritage. <br/>As me and my partners were running towards the arcade, I heard the shots  being fired and I felt something hit my arm. I fractured my humerus and shattered my radius. This morning, I brought up the fact that I'm a police officer and that I was  shot, almost losing my arm. And that was a life-changing experience for me. Initially they were going to take my arm. The doctors told my mom they wanted to take my arm because it was so bad and  I lost so much blood. <br/>Christina is a super strong woman. I definitely respect all the stuff that she's gone through in her life. She's definitely a role model as far as I see it. <br/>So I got my arm back and came back to work full time. <br/>That's huge. That's huge. <br/>That's why I wear the bullet. <br/>There are the chickens over there, they're walking past. Look over the clothesline. <br/>We've been trying to figure out how to snag a chicken for a few days. We've seen them running around wild all over the place, so we decided to make  a chicken trap. <br/>Once the chicken goes up top, we can pull the net and it will kind of catch  them like in a little bag. <br/>Oh, you want to do it that way? <br/>Tina had her chance to set it up, and I'm making a concerted effort not to  shoot down all of her ideas. But a lot of the ideas she has are coming from somebody who's not done a lot  of camping, who's not been in the outdoors a lot, so they don't make sense to  me. <br/>I think we should stretch it, like, wide across here and then we'll create,  like, a little tunnel. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Ozzy feels like he knows everything, and he probably does, but every idea has  to be his idea. So he is getting under my skin a little bit. <br/>I think we can do it. Look, we have this line right here. Christina and I, we don't click very well. I think it's because, for one thing, she's a cop, and also just the fact that  I'm ten years younger than her and I understand, because if I had a  14-year-old telling me what to do, I'd probably get a little pissed off  myself. <br/>I feel like I've shown what I offer to the tribe, so I feel comfortable with  my standing within the rest of the group. <br/>There is so much food to cook. <br/>There's more. <br/>Oh, is there really? <br/>Yeah, look. <br/>Awesome. <br/>Tina? <br/>Is she upset? <br/>Is she? <br/>We got two chickens, woo-hoo! We've got two of them at one time. There's two, right? <br/>There's two, yeah. <br/>Yes. <br/>Good job, Yul, good job. <br/>Day four for the Puka tribe started out on a really high note because Yul  actually caught two of the chickens. We're really excited because I think everybody was pretty hungry for  something substantial. Yul's a smart guy. He's very intelligent and a good person to have on your side. &gt;&gt;( inaudib ) I trust you because I feel like...  No, that's what... even from the very beginning, yeah. <br/>Becky, she's a lawyer, but she does a lot of non-profit work. I respect that and I don't think someone like that is likely to be in this  game just to make a lot of money, so I trust her. <br/>I would love to see one of us do it. <br/>Especially if there were, like, Korean...  That's why I want us to stay together. Yul and I are both Korean, so obviously there's a bond there, and we're  automatically going to form alliances because of that. In Korean, you call an older brother an oppa, and Yul seems sort of like an  older brother to me. <br/>Sticking together, obviously, would help us in the game. <br/>I want to stay together. I agree. Cool. <br/>Oh, I think it's him. Papa bear is coming home. ( screaming )  Oh, God. Exile Island was really terrible, but I came back to my tribe and they're all  very happy to see me and I'm happy to see them. <br/>All over the place. I dug around for the idol; I didn't find it, unfortunately. Now I've come back and, like, these guys haven't done anything. How is the shelter for the rain? <br/>Well, the most uncomfortable part is the floor. <br/>We slept on the ground. <br/>Why don't we start a fire and let's make this floor. You know what I mean? Because it's going to be night four and we don't have a real shelter for  ourselves. I don't understand why they don't have a better floor. Basically, it's the same shack they've been in for three or four days. I don't understand that. <br/>I'm really excited about pimping out our palace. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jonathan and I decided to pick up the speed a bit and try to get something  done to make our camp better. But Parvati, Adam and Candice, they like to gossip and waste time and not  really do things. And I was just like, "Somebody do something." Let's get some things  done. Hey Adam, this is quite a bit of work. <br/>I think it's the dumbest thing to be doing this. Why do you think you'll sleep better when it's raised than on the ground? <br/>It was wet and it was cold. <br/>Yeah, but what does raised going to do to change that? <br/>We won't be on the wet ground. <br/>Do you two want a raised platform? <br/>I thought it sounded nice. <br/>I know you do, but these two. We didn't decide things as a group. I want to know what y'all's opinion is, you two, on the floor? You guys haven't said anything. <br/>I think the flat bamboo would be comfortable and it's already started. <br/>It's crazy, I think. <br/>Well, what do you want to do today? <br/>I just don't want to waste energy on something that... just to look good. I mean this is...  I don't know. Let's see if we can get this floor done. Adam is hungry and he's crabby and he doesn't understand that other people  have other needs. And I don't need him being like that. <br/>I won't. I won't. <br/>Oh, my God. Wow. We got five of them. <br/>Oh, wow! <br/>Definitely, I've been trying to conserve my energy because, (a), I don't have  a whole lot of energy to burn, and (b), I think it's stupid to just waste  your time doing something you don't know anything about. So, since they know more about spearing fish and getting coconuts and  whatnot, I just let them burn the energy and I'll just go ahead and have some  of whatever they catch. <br/>You want to start getting that net together for the chicken? <br/>We need to clean it off nice and flat. You know, it's really difficult if everyone's not pulling their weight, you  know? It gets tiring having to tell someone what to do all of the time. I go, "Billy, can you do this?" "Billy, can you do that?"  "Billy, can you do this?" You know, I hate saying that. <br/>Well, I think we all just work together instead of kind of going off in our  own little ways. <br/>I agree. <br/>It will work out so much better. <br/>I don't know, I guess I kind of feel a little bit on the outside sometimes. <br/>They shouldn't... you know what, you should...  It's like, I don't relate the same way as, like... even though I'm Hispanic,  I don't feel Hispanic, you know? It's like metal is my culture instead of Hispanic being my culture. <br/>I think that's good, because you have differences you bring to the group. <br/>Oh, thanks, thanks. <br/>So, I mean, we want you to be included, be a part of this group. <br/>So you don't feel excluded, like, you know, jump in. <br/>I was working directly in the hot sun, and I quickly got a headache, and Cao  Boi came in with his magical powers. <br/>There's a deep, deep red. Yours is just red. Yours will probably go away within a day. Most of the people I know in my life, sooner or later, if they're friends  with me long enough, they experience a red mark, and it always work for them,  too. You're done. <br/>( laughs ) Thank you. It helps, a lot. It felt great. I asked him not to give me the same kind of slash he gave to Brad. But apparently I guess I have something here now. But at least my headache's gone. <br/>Oh, I make fun of them all the time. You've got to be able to laugh at yourself, first of all. <br/>Well, of course, but, I don't know, I think if you were a little bit  sensitive about it because of the situation...  I have no hang-up, you know, and I can just make fun of it and just laugh. Like what do you call a Vietnamese with three dogs? <br/>I think the bigger picture is, like, we get it, but a lot of people won't get  it. <br/>Exactly. <br/>I don't worry about what other people think. They get to my case because you make this racist joke about Asian people, and  I just want them to understand that to represent your race is not about  avoiding the jokes. <br/>If you're making jokes based on racial prejudice or stereotypes, it's just  going to confirm them in people's minds that don't know any better. <br/>Well, a joke is a joke, right? <br/>No, it's not. <br/>No? <br/>Can I tell you guys one more joke that is not really offensive to anyone here  at all? <br/>No. <br/>One thing about Cao Boi is it's good to have a sense of humor, but if it's at  the expense of a particular ethnic group, I don't think that's cool. ( snoring )  Just keep it as an option. I think it could help us in the long run because we're not going to have to  be carrying his weight anymore. <br/>Cecilia, Christina, Ozzy and I were sitting together, and I had it in my mind. Thank God Ozzy brought it up. And he's, like, "We should throw the challenge tomorrow and get rid of  Billy."  That's making us look bad. I don't want to do that. <br/>It's a strategy. We lose Billy, we come back stronger than ever. <br/>Ozzy, he really wants to throw the challenge to get Billy taken off. And I'm thinking, you know, "This doesn't seem right." That will  put us in a better position all around. <br/>It is really sad that we're already saying, "Let's put one of our guys  off." I still think we should all work as a team, so it's disappointing. And I don't know if I can trust Oscar anymore. <br/>Tree mail. <br/>Sorry, who's going to read it? I read the last one. <br/>"Reward and immunity, your only tribal hopes. You are bound by honor and by belts and by ropes."  "Collaborative thinking, you must all move as one. Another leaves the island by the setting sun."  Be like an obstacle course. <br/>Be like chained... chaining together. <br/>I don't know, this is good, though, ladies. We wanted something we could all work as a team, so let's do it. <br/>We're ready, right? <br/>This is obviously for immunity, so we need this. We're four down; everyone else has five, so we definitely don't want to lose  another member. We hav to win. <br/>We're talking about in this next challenge trying to lose it, just trying to  get Billy out of our team. And I was really kind of worried about the whole thing. <br/>You better get your head in this game if you want to stay in it longer  because he'll take you out. He should be here right now with us right now. Why not? Why isn't he here right now? Why isn't he reading this with us? Why aren't we discussing it? Why? I know what I'm doing. <br/>Billy's just dead weight. At this point, it's only the second tribal council, so we might as well cut  our losses now and get on with the game. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. Getting your first look at the new Hiki tribe. Sekou voted out of the first tribal council. All right, first things first-- take back immunity. Once again, immunity back up for grabs. I'm going to read you a short story about Captain Cook's three historic  expeditions into the Pacific. When I'm finished reading the story, you're going to move as a group tied  together. You'll go under and over a series of logs. You'll go through a field of poles where you must untie and gather seven  answer plaques. You'll cross a two-line rope bridge over a pit of water. Once you reach the finish, you will use the seven plaques to answer five  questions about the story. Make sense? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Today's challenge is for both reward and immunity. Hopefully this reward will come in handy. Two tarps. With 34 more days out here, you're going to get a lot of rain. So, to be clear, the first tribe to finish gets the tarps; first three to  finish get immunity; last to finish, tribal council, somebody going home. And once again, the losing tribe will decide which tribe member from the  other tribes goes to Exile Island. Clear? <br/>Clear. <br/>Probst: Raro, Aitu, Puka, you each have one extra member, who are you going  to sit out? Give you a second to strategize. <br/>I'll sit out, I'll sit out. <br/>I should sit, I should sit, I should sit. I'm like the worst at memory. <br/>I'm bad at memory, too. Totally... I'm out. <br/>All right. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: All right, who's going to sit out? <br/>Me. <br/>Me. <br/>Probst: Jenny, and J.P., Adam, take a spot on your benches. Everybody else, meet me over at the start and we'll get going. Okay, I'll read the story: "James Cook's first voyage took him to the  French Polynesian Islands. Tahiti was his destination. During this trip, Cook also mapped the entire coast of New Zealand. His second voyage, Cook found and named New Caledonia. On Cook's final voyage, he became the first European to locate the Hawaiian  Islands, which he called the Sandwich Islands. This trip would be his last. Cook perished in Hawaii in 1779." Now, after hearing this story, if you  are not confident that you remember all the details, each tribe has a written  version on the table in front of you. Keep in mind reading the book could cost you valuable time. For immunity and reward, survivors ready? Go! Three tribes heading out without reading the book, only Aitu taking the time  to look through it and make sure they are right. Huge strategy move. Everybody getting up and over the log. Nobody panicking. Raro first through, Puka through, Hiki working their way through. Puka's on the course, Raro's on the course, Hiki's on the course. Aitu really taking their time. Will it pay off? Puka with their first plaque, Candice with the first plaque for Raro, Hiki  has their first plaque. Aitu, now they're out in this. Jonathan has a second plaque for Raro. Brad and Cao Boi getting a plaque at the same time for Puka. They've got three plaques total. Candice getting their third plaque for Raro. <br/>Keep going, guys. <br/>Probst: Hiki, you're still in it, but you're falling behind. Aitu finally on the board with their first plaque. Cao Boi and Brad with five plaques for Puka. There are seven plaques total. Raro with their fifth plaque. <br/>Hold on, I'm almost there, guys. <br/>Probst: Jonathan gets Raro's sixth plaque. Hiki with four plaques, Aitu with two, Candice working on the last plaque for  Raro. Puka right behind. Brad's got to get the last one. We're neck-and-neck. Puka and Raro. Puka has it. Let's go, Raro. Puka first on the rope bridge, Raro right behind. <br/>Left, right. Left, right. <br/>Probst: Hiki, you're still in it. First three tribes to finish win immunity. Loser's going to tribal council. Puka doing a great job on the bridge. It's Puka and Raro fighting for reward. Hiki starting to make up some ground. Aitu not panicking, but they're not moving quickly either. <br/>Here we go. <br/>It's okay. <br/>The island Cook named on his second voyage was New Caledonia. <br/>You ready? <br/>The last island he visited was Hawaii, right? <br/>Cook located the Hawaiian Islands and called them Sandwich Islands. <br/>That's right. <br/>His final words were last to be visited was Hawaii. <br/>Tahiti. <br/>Probst: Got to get on your mats. Puka wins! Raro has it right! Hiki working together well. They're still in this challenge. Immunity on the line. <br/>Tahiti, yeah. <br/>Probst: Aitu finally on the rope bridge. Aitu is having a holiday. Hiki thinks they have it right. Hiki has it right! ( screaming ) Puka, Raro, Hiki, all safe from tribal council. Okay, first order of business: after reviewing the tapes, it is clear the  challenge ended in a tie between Puka and Rarotonga. You'll each be getting two tarps. All right, Aitu, the only good thing about losing this challenge, you get to  decide who is going to Exile Island. A big decision to make. Who's it going to be? <br/>We're going to send Yul, the strongest member over there. So we'll try to weaken them up there. <br/>Yul, boat's waiting for you now. Head down to the beach, boat will pick you up. <br/>One thing left to do: Hiki, immunity, no tribal council. ( applause ) Puka, you, too, are safe. Raro, no tribal council. Aitu, you know what that means-- tribal council, date with me, somebody going  home. Grab your stuff, head on back to camp. <br/>We lost the challenge, basically on purpose, and I'm sorry to say that, but  it's something that we had to do. Billy dug his own hole by just not working. And his lack of work showed a lack of commitment to the tribe. And you guys are lollygagging. <br/>Losing that challenge, it just really bothered me. It was such an easy game. It just makes me realize that Ozzy is very conniving. He's just all for himself. And I really see him trying to control everything. <br/>No, you don't have... I mean, yeah, you can do it like that. I just like to...  So right now, the situation is pretty bleak. I just hope to God I can find some opening, some crack to go through and  somehow pull it out. <br/>Going to Exile Island really sucked. There's pretty much nothing on it. I feel like I have a pretty strong connection with the members of my tribe. I miss them, hopefully they miss me, and it will be an opportunity just to  uncover the immunity idol. "Use the mast and an island to form a letter. Block out the south island and you're doing better." From the clues, I  basically take it that I have to line up one of two possible isles to get an  "A" shape using the isle and the mast. The last bit of the clue is that I have to make southern island disappear, so  I assume that I keep walking up and down the line until I can no longer see  the southern isle, and so I've marked the place where that occurs. Oh, mama. Oh, wow. Yes! It's a compass. "You have just discovered something of great value. This immunity idol will keep you safe from being voted off at tribal council  once only. The last time you can use any hidden immunity idol is when they are four  survivors remaining in the game. I found the immunity idol, which is probably the single biggest stroke of  luck I could have had. If there is a clear opportunity where it can change the game, I'll use it. <br/>( inaudible ) in the water. <br/>Would you rinse it out before you put any stuff in? <br/>Yeah. You don't feel bad? <br/>It's all right. He's not trustworthy. I don't feel bad, I really don't. <br/>Once I figured it out, I didn't want to be in this tribe anymore. I think those two guys played me for a patsy. That whole taking your sweet time basically was a game. And once I'm gone, you're on the block. <br/>Exactly. <br/>I hope they don't throw another game just to try to get rid of you. My only avenue right now, my only shot, is with Christina. So, I just threw out there that if I go now, she is going next. And it flies with her, like, she understands it. I really don't. <br/>No, Ozzy's playing the hardest. <br/>Yeah, he really is. In my job, I see people all the time, they're always in a lie. And I had this feeling about Oscar... I think Oscar's more of a threat right  now, and he has been really playing everybody. Why have we voted someone from our own team off? Let's be strong. <br/>Yeah, absolutely. <br/>I hope you do. Honestly, I hope you do. ( speaking Spanish )  No, girl. We're on the same page. Look him in the eye, for real. We're on the same page. <br/>Okay. <br/>Christina came up to me and she asked me if Oscar and I had any kind of  alliance or any kind of an agreement. And we don't. But she asked that in Spanish. <br/>I'm just kind of nervous. Just wondering. <br/>As a police officer, she has to trust her partners because her life depends  on that. So I can imagine how a little bit of that is coming into play here. But I hope she can trust me because I'm being honest with her. I'm good with you, for sure. So it's whatever we decide to do is whatever we decide to do. <br/>Okay, sounds good. <br/>I do think Billy is going to stir stuff up-- going behind my back and trying  to switch people over, trying to flip-flop so that, you know, maybe it's me  because he wants me gone. Christina is probably going to be the most sympathetic. But if they want to throw me out, go ahead and do it because I know they're  going to suffer really bad if they lose me. <br/>My best hope is that somehow, someway, Christina found a way to get in  Cecilia's ears and plant the seed just long enough for her to swing a vote. So all my chips are on Christina. My hand is a weak hand, but at least I got one queen. <br/>Probst: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch, approach the flame and get fire. This is part of the ritual of tribal council because in this game, fire  represents your life. As long as you have fire, you're still in the game. When your fire is gone, so you are. Have a seat. So, let's talk about the first six days. Billy, did a leader step up and say, "Here's what we're going to  do?"  Well, initially, we just hit the ground running, but little by little, Ozzy  emerged as the big voice. This was his element; he's very much an outdoorsman. <br/>Probst: Christina, do you agree with Billy that Ozzy is the leader? <br/>I don't feel that he's a leader. I feel that he tries to take control of certain things because he does have  experience in this area; he feels a little more confident in that. <br/>Probst: Ozzy, do you think you're the leader? <br/>No, I don't think I'm the leader. There are certain things that I have specific knowledge of that if I don't  voice my opinion, then it's going to get done wrong. But I think that our strongest thing is we can all get things done as a team  and it gives us a lot of pride because we know that if we work hard, we're  going to be stronger than anybody else. <br/>Probst: Do you think this tribe represented themselves well in the last  challenge? <br/>No, the last challenge-- not really. <br/>Probst: Billy, when I asked the question, you're like, "Oh, come  on."  Actually, a lot of our loss had to do with me. J.P. and Ozzy decided I'm hurting the tribe way too much and so they were going to  throw the challenge. <br/>Probst: You believe they threw the challenge? <br/>I know they threw the challenge. <br/>Probst: J.P., you threw a challenge? With only five tribe members, you're already willing to lose somebody? <br/>At this point, yeah. I don't believe in having to carry weight of somebody who I don't believe is  trusting and who doesn't carry the workload. <br/>Probst: Billy, are you surprised to hear that trust is an issue? <br/>I understand that a game is being played, but I fell into a classic trap, and  now I'm on the chopping block. <br/>No, no, no, no, no. I hate the way he's trying to sound like he's a victim right now. <br/>I was a player. I'm not saying I'm a victim. <br/>And you know how to say the greatest things to make yourself look so damn  good. <br/>I'm clawing and scratching or whatever-- yeah, I'm playing the game. That's my dream. <br/>Part of the game is trying to to involve yourself. That way people find you valuable...  I'm still talking here. I'm still talking here. You'll get your turn, Mr. Bully. <br/>Obviously you're not valuable. <br/>You're Mr. Bully, you'll get your turn. <br/>Call me whatever you want. <br/>I don't give a rat's ass. So, like I was saying, I'm playing the game. That's what I came here to do. My prize isn't even the million dollars. My prize was that I fell in love in this game, love at first sight. Her name is Candice. And in between... ( laughter )  Probst: Candice from Raro tribe? <br/>Yeah. After the last challenge, we sort of mouthed the words "I love you"  to one another, and so that was my prize. My prize was her. <br/>Probst: I've never heard anything that surprised me more than what you just  said. And I want to be respectful because I don't know what happened. But what would she base feeling the same way you feel on? <br/>I think it's just, you know, love at first sight. I think it's just a rapport thing. <br/>Probst: So you're absolutely sincere now? <br/>I'm dead serious. <br/>Probst: Ozzy, have you noticed anything between Candice and Billy? <br/>Man, I haven't noticed anything. But, I mean, I'm not looking for it. It's new to me as it is you. <br/>Probst: J.P., what's your take on the Billy/Candice romance? <br/>Listen, I'm sorry, but from the beginning, he was sketchy. Just shady. From the beginning. And if I seemed insensitive to the whole deal, whatever. But then he brings up things like this love at first sight stuff, I mean,  it's just... oh, hell, I don't know, it's just random. <br/>Probst: Christina, is it unreal? <br/>I think anything's possible in life, but I feel very leery for Billy. <br/>Probst: Christina, you seem to have a soft spot for Billy. <br/>I just don't want him to get hurt. I just hate when people get taken advantage of, and I just... I'm not into  the dishonesty and to the back-stabbing. I just really... I'm, you know, taking care of him, at least, looking out for  his best interests. <br/>Probst: Okay, there's been a lot said here tonight, and I'm very curious to  see how it plays out. It is time to vote. Ozzy, you're up. <br/>If I can't trust you now, I won't be able to trust you later on in the game. <br/>The only reason why I'm voting for you is because you are the best player in  the Aitutaki tribe. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Billy. Ozzy. One vote Billy, one vote Ozzy. Billy. Two votes Billy, one vote Ozzy. The second person voted out of Survivor: Cook Islands-- Billy. That's three. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Billy, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. <br/>Probst: Well, two issues emerged tonight: work ethic and trust. It sounds like you just dealt with the issue of work ethic. The question is: how will you deal with the unresolved issue of trust? Grab your torches, go back to camp.

Next time on Survivor: Mother Nature fights back...  Look at him sucking me. <br/>Probst: ...Parvati works her assets...  I'm absolutely going to flirt. Aww, baby monkey. It is what I do best. <br/>When you have children, you're screwed. <br/>Probst: ...And Cao Boi turns up the volume. <br/>The guy does not shut up. <br/>( laughs )  I came into this wanting to live the dream of playing Survivor. I got... I lived that dream for six days and I think it's kind of cool that  the heavy metal guy's getting eliminated by some guy named Ozzy. My biggest regret is I didn't play the way I wish I would of. I didn't represent myself well in the beginning. But I'm not going to regret anything because I still got to live the dream. Too bad there wasn't a heavy metal tribe. I think I would have fit in better over there.
