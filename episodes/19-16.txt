<br/>I'll trust you, so, do I have that same trust with you? <br/>Yes. <br/>I want people to think that, hey, it's really smart for them to take me to  the end because they can beat me. [sighing]  Probst: No score for Natalie. <br/>No, no! <br/>This is the hardest thing I've ever done. Oh, my word! But make no mistake. I'm not gonna give up. <br/>Probst: Natalie is making up the lost time. Natalie places it for Foa Foa! Natalie hanging out of that cradle. <br/>Eat your snack, buddy. Oh, gosh! Oh, my word! Oh, I'm sorry. I don't trust Erik. My strategy was to build good relationships, be underestimated and be the  last one standing. [applause and cheering] [applause and cheering] [band plays upbeat rock  music] [band plays upbeat rock music]  Probst: It is the live Survivor: Samoa Reunion Show. Natalie, congratulations. <br/>Thank you so much. [cheers and applause] Thank you all. <br/>Probst: Now, let's talk about... Before you got on the show, this was not an  easy decision. You were back and forth. You missed your plane to come to casting several times. You ended up having to quit your job. What was it that might... that finally made you say, "Yes, I'm going to  do this?"  Well, it's a true story. It was about having no regrets, and hey, you've got to take a big risk to get  a big return. <br/>Probst: You gave up a lot, though. You literally left your job, the car, the insurance, the gas. <br/>I did. I had to quit my job to do it. So I gave up a wonderful job, not just a wonderful job, but it was one that I  loved so much. So, yeah, I gave up a company car. That means gas and insurance, health insurance. So there was a lot to... a lot at risk for me. <br/>Probst: Besides the obvious now that you have a million dollars that will be  in your bank account tomorrow, what's the impact on your life? Because this is... To undergo this kind of adventure that you guys do, you're  tested on so many levels. Did it change you? <br/>Absolutely. It's a very humbling experience. Um, I think anybody up here could say you really realize want versus need,  uh, and it...  Probst: Meaning what? <br/>Well, you know, when you think you need the razor to shave, you really don't  need a razor to survive. So it really puts in perspective want versus need, so...  Probst: Key move in the game. What's the key move youmade? <br/>The key move I made for sure, hands down-- Erik, I'm sorry-- but it was  getting Erik ousted, so...  Probst: If you don't get Erik out, what happens? <br/>Um, if Erik would not have gotten eliminated, um, I believe that it would  have been Jaison going home, and then our numbers would have been down to  three, and it would have just been one by one. <br/>Probst: Now, tell me about your relationship with Russell. How did that work? <br/>Wow! Okay, well, Russell pretty much, um... We were a team. We would bounce things back and forth off of each other. Uh, Russell, uh, did... I would say he took the bullets. Hands on. And I would be the one behind, even though I was doing the same type thing, I  was a lot more subtle than Russell was. <br/>Probst: So do you think you played a different social game, and that's...? <br/>Absolutely. Absolutely. <br/>Probst: Was that the difference? <br/>I think so. <br/>Probst: Russell, do you agree with that? Was that the difference? <br/>First of all, I don't agree with her key move in the game. Her key move in the game was aligning with me. [applause and cheering]  Probst: And we're off and running. <br/>Okay, maybe I had two key moves then. <br/>Probst: But do you agree that this game does come down to getting a vote? Did Natalie have a better social game? <br/>You don't think I had a good social game? [laughter] I had Jaison. I had Mick, Natalie, Shambo. They trusted me. That's why they stayed with me. That sounds like a pretty damn good social game to me. <br/>Probst: You-You look visibly upset right now. <br/>Yeah, I mean, I feel like that I played the best strategic game in history. I think that... [applause and cheering] And I'm not the only one that thinks  that. I can guarantee you, millions of people probably think that same thing, but  you know...  AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes! [cheers]  And Natalie-- her best move was to jump on my back. <br/>Probst: Different question. Did you bring the wrong people to the final? What if you had brought Jaison and Shambo? <br/>That's... That's a question I think about all the time. Should I have brought Jaison and Shambo? <br/>Probst: Let's poll the jury and include Mick and Natalie on the jury now. <br/>Right. <br/>Probst: Now that you guys that are on the jury, you've got Mick, Natalie, and  everybody else, and it's-it's Jaison and Shambo. Does Russell win the game? Jury? No? Some yeses. Give me a show of hands. Let's go. How many people vote for Russell? There's four. <br/>No? <br/>Nah. <br/>Probst: How many people vote for Shambo. <br/>You would vote for me. <br/>Probst: There's two. How many vote for Jaison? There's one. Russell, you made the wrong choice. <br/>Oh! [laughter]  Probst: While you were talking to Natalie, we just held an impromptu vote. You had four votes. That would have been enough. Keep you up at night? <br/>That sucks. [laughter] You know... You know, the thing is, it's... it... I... First of  all, I have a question I want to ask Natalie. <br/>Probst: Okay. <br/>Natalie, all I want is the title of sole survivor. [laughter] I will pay you $10,000 for the title. If Jeff says, "Russell, you are the sole survivor," and I get it in  paper written down that I am the sole survivor... [cheering and applause] ...I  will retire. <br/>Take it. Take it. <br/>Probst: Well, now...  Take the money. <br/>Probst: All right, Natalie, first, he's asking you... Are you asking Natalie  to say to you you're a better player? <br/>No, I'm asking her to ask you to tell me that I'm the sole survivor. [laughter and applause]  Probst: So, you-you can just ask me directly. You want me to say that you're the best player. <br/>I'll...  Probst: It brings up an interesting question. Erik, give me some perspective on this. <br/>Cardona! <br/>Thanks. [laughter]  Probst: Erik, here's the question. It's really interesting, because in the confines and the context of this  game, Natalie won. She figured out, you could argue, she figured out, "My best move, go  next to the bruiser, let him take the bullets. They won't like him. They'll like me." That is a strategy that is legitimate in this game. She's got the million bucks. Fair enough. [cheering] So no disrespect to you. Russell's argument is, nobody played like I played this season, which I would  agree-- nobody. Russell dominated the game with big, bold moves, found idols when there  weren't clues, all sorts of things. [applause and cheering] So is it possible to not win the game and be the  better player? Or is that impossible in Survivor? You have to win. <br/>I think for the first time in my life in any competition, anything, uh, my  entire life, this game truly, winning is arbitrary. And they say clichÃ    s like, "It's not whether you  win or lose. It's how you play the game." I always thought that was B.S. that losers said, you know, but...  Probst: So what are you saying? <br/>I'm saying, you don't...  Probst: Did Russell play a better game? <br/>Than Natalie? <br/>No. <br/>I don't value his strategy more than hers. I don't value hers more than his. <br/>Probst: Jaison, quick comment on social politics. Because still, as we sit here, the audience overwhelmingly says, yes, Russell  played the better game. [cheering and applause] The people who played with him say he did not. What did you learn about the importance of perception and social politics? <br/>Uh, well, I think that this game is a lot like real life. I mean, everyone works in an office, uh, on a team, working on projects, like  our challenges, trying to get individual distinctions so that they can move  forward, while at the same time winning the games and the challenges. And I think everyone who works in an office also has a Russell there who  says, "I didn't come to work. I came to play." And I think it's interesting that people really seem to  be valuing, um, his-his-his negative contributions over, you know, someone  like Natalie, who's-who's trying to be more positive and moral and whatever,  so, for me, Natalie played the better game. [applause and cheering]  Probst: Equal round of applause, I got to say. <br/>And... so-so it's interesting to me that people... People hate Russell in  real life. They go to work every day and go, "I hate that guy!" [applause and  cheering] But then you come on Survivor, and all of a sudden, all the  backstabbing and pouring out water and burning socks is game play? I mean, what is that? So that's-that's... I just think it's wrong. <br/>Jaison is still bitter for me burning his socks. Are you kidding me? He is... You know what Jaison? I got something for you. [laughter]  Thank you, Russell. <br/>You know what? <br/>Thank you. <br/>Never mind. I'll burn them, too. [applause and cheering]  That's what I've got for you. <br/>Well, she's got your check! And that's why she got the check! <br/>Probst: All right, while these guys work out the sock issue, we're going to  go to break. Still to come, I'm sure we will, uh, hear a lot more from Russell. And up next, the woman with the scariest hairstyle, Shambo, and the man who  lived through the scariest moment, Russell Swan. It's the Survivor: Samoa Live Reunion Show. We'll be right back. Survivors ready? Go! [overlapping chatter] Big collision right off the bat. Oh! This is gonna be physical. [groaning] Oh! Some skin coming off on that one. [indistinct chatter]  Left, left, left. To your left! Left! Left! <br/>Probst: Stop! <br/>Are you all right? <br/>Are you all right? [panting] [panting]  Probst: Who do you think is the smartest? <br/>I'm choosing Shambo. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh! <br/>911. I didn't know they could fly. [imitating chicken]  There have been times when I just want to go, "Did your mom drop you on  your head?" [Shambo clucking]  Probst: What do you call that hair, Shambo? <br/>Shambolicious, baby. <br/>The mullet went out in the '70s. It looks terrible. <br/>People have gravitated to me my entire life. It's, like, "Oh, my God, this chick rocks. We love her." [laughing] [cheering] [band plays upbeat music]  Probst: Welcome back to the Survivor: Samoa Live Reunion Show. Shambo, I'm guessing-- I mean, even the way you're dressed now-- it's hard to  miss you. Are you getting a big reaction from people? <br/>I'm getting a really positive reaction in Seattle. It's pretty overwhelming. And it's-it's-it's an honor. It's-It's absolutely awesome, because it gives me a venue to just lambaste  positive, hugely, in my area that love, that I grew up in, that's beautiful,  and touch a lot of kids' lives. And I'm just going to go for it and ride the wave. [cheering and applause]  Probst: So you get a lot of kids who relate to you. I know my nieces are crazy about you and your crazy way and your hair. Is that the biggest response from young-young people? <br/>It's kind of across the board. I mean, it's-it's insane. I have elderly-- I mean, 80-plus-year-old people. It's-It's not gender-defined. It's not age-defined. It's really across the board. I-I don't really get it. But it's-it's... Some days I can't do my job because I'm going in and out of  restaurants or day cares or, you know, casinos, and I'm, like, dipping in the  back door now, going, "Hey, dude, can you go get the manager? I can't go into the dining room 'cause it's going to be on." "Here,  talk to my mom!" [laughter]  Probst: Tell me about the hair. How many years have you had this hairstyle? <br/>Well, I think I started growing it out length-wise... [laughter]  Probst: Oh, there we go. We've got a shot right next to you. What-What year is that? <br/>Oh, dear God. [laughter]  Probst: What year is that? <br/>That's, uh... that's in Okinawa, Japan, playing Marine Corps softball, right  there, 1986. <br/>Probst: '86. Wow. 23 years? <br/>Well, it started in '84. <br/>Probst: Okay. [laughter] Tell me about your relationship with Laura. One of the other interesting things about Survivoris that you get dropped  into this extreme... this situation of extreme conflict with people that you  might normally not even want to talk to, let alone rely on. What was it about you two? Was it just friction from the beginning? That's how you are? <br/>Laura! Yeah! [cheering]  You know, I don't even think it was friction. I think that Laura and I are both two incredibly independent, strong women in  our own lives, and I think we kind of rule our roost, and I think on day one,  we kind of did the... [clucks]. And we walked away from each other. [laughter]  Probst: Laura... Laura what's your take on it? Because it was one of the most talked about relationships this season is you  two. <br/>Yeah, you know what? Like Shambo said, we both have our own, um, interpretation of what happened. I don't specifically recall doing the... [imitates clucking] ...with Shambo. But you know what? Um, so many things could have transpired from that. I think that there was a threat because when the tribe would say who's the  strongest woman, they would say Laura, and, you know, Shambo being the marine  and I being the grandma, and that's who's the strongest one? We're going to go with granny? I think that's probably kind of hard to hear. And, um, I loved the girls on my tribes. They reminded me of my daughter, so there was that bond. I just think there was just so many different elements that played into it. <br/>Probst: What's the status today-- are you guys talking, not talking? Ever going to talk again? <br/>Um, no. We've-We've exchanged a few messages, but look it, um...  Probst: Wow. That said everything, Laura. That said it all. <br/>You know...  Probst: So, that relationship is just not one that's probably gonna bloom a  long-term...  Look, Jeff, let me just say this. There's been forgiveness that's been given. Um, whether a relationship will continue after that, honestly, probably not,  but the biggest thing is that there was forgiveness on both sides, and we're  both gonna go our own ways. <br/>Probst: That sounds good. [applause and cheering] Dave? Dave, does it surprise you how quickly you can form bonds that in many cases  do last years and years and years, like a family, in a way? <br/>Uh, it's pretty shocking. I-I found that coming out, I really felt like I had a new family. It was just... I mean, in addition to my amazing family, also, as well. [cheering] [laughter] Uh, but, you know, I... You know, Brett, Lolo, Kelly--  I'd do anything for them. I mean, they're tough, they're tough competitors, they're great human beings,  and they mean the world to me. It's really... [applause and cheering]  Probst: Brett, I got to ask. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: A carnival game thought up in a field somewhere in Samoa cost you a  million dollars. <br/>Yeah, I mean, walking into that challenge, I'm, like, "This is a  carnival game for one million dollars." And, you know, holding this  little figurine on this stick, just hoping that mine stays there till the end. 'Cause I knew, like, when... Immediately when that thing falls, I'm done. And if anyone can ever experience that level of pressure in their life, you  know, best of luck to you. But that was probably, probably the most stressful thing I've ever done, and,  you know, fate took its course, I guess. <br/>Probst: Because there... I mean, it's kind of... We can... We can do this  just for the sake of doing it. There's no question with Galu on the jury, right...? Jury, show the hands. Brett wins if he's in the final. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: Okay. So, it's got... You've got to roll this. When you watched it back and saw that... I mean, when you saw it just now for  the first time tonight...  Mm-hmm, yeah. <br/>Probst: ...did you relive that? <br/>Oh, yeah, I relived it. It was... It was sad. It was very tough, coming all the way to the end, being one of the final four  people, and to have your fate determined by a figurine falling over. I mean, it is one for my memoirs, I guess. But, you know, it's-it's a tough thing, but you know, that is life, and you  know, you got to move on. <br/>Probst: All right. Well, in addition to some tumultuous personal relationships, this year also had  its share of physical hardships. One of thescariest moments in the history of our show came on day 15. Take a look. Russell still struggling to get to the finish. <br/>Russell. <br/>Russell...  I want the ball to go down to...  Probst: Everybody hold up. Medical. <br/>Lie him down. <br/>Russ, are you okay? Talk to me. Russ, are you with us? Russell? Russell? Russell? Russell? Russell, can you hear me? Russell, can you hear me? <br/>Probst: Russell. [applause and cheering] We're glad you're here, man. <br/>I'm glad to be here, Jeff, definitely. <br/>Probst: Let's-Let's go back, because you didn't know how bad it was when you  were out there. <br/>No, absolutely not. I mean, I had no idea. In fact, I was quite livid with you...  Probst: Yup. <br/>I mean, you're a nice guy and all that, Jeff, but I mean, you know, you said  I'm done, and I couldn't believe it. I had no idea I was that bad. I thought I was still good to go. I still wanted to compete. And next thing I know, I'm out. And I didn't know until I actually watched the episode how bad I was. <br/>Probst: And what was that? You're at home with your wife, Caroline, right? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: And you're watching this, and you don't know what you're about to  see, which is, you were close to being gone. <br/>No, right. I mean, I had no idea. I mean, and I felt so bad. Because normally, I would warn my wife. I mean, I love her to death. I wouldn't want to, you know... to have her see something that shocking, and  I had no idea. So we're sitting there watching it, and all of a sudden, you know, the whole  eyes thing goes, and she loses it. And she's, like, "You're dead! You're dead!" [laughter] And I'm like, "No, I'm here."  "You're dead!" "I'm here!" "You're dead!" So,  we had a little argument about whether or not I was dead, which I found kind  of interesting, but... [laughter] Suffice it to say, I mean, I just felt bad  because it was... it was that poignant. <br/>Probst: Well, and you told me later that it all made sense, because you said,  "You know what? There was a moment when..." It sounds to me like you had a near-death  experience. <br/>Absolutely. I mean, there's no doubt about it. I have never felt that good in my life. I have never...  Probst: This is in the midst of this trauma? <br/>This is in the midst of this. The sky looked very blue and wonderful. I felt great. I thought, "Man, this is... I feel great. I'm gonna, like, you know, take this-this game, like, by storm." Um,  but, no, I was going, uh... [laughs] I was going heavenward. Hopefully. <br/>Probst: Well, we are glad you're here, and thanks to our medical team. They were on... They were taking care of you the entire time. [cheering and applause] All right, still to come, Sprint is going to award  $100,000 to one of this season's castaways based on your votes. And up next, he emptied his own tribe mates' canteens. He burned their socks. He lied about being in Hurricane Katrina. And he found idols without clues. The only thing Russell didn't do was win the game. He's next. We'll be right back. [applause and cheering] [applause and cheering] [band plays upbeat rock  music] [band plays upbeat rock music]  Probst: Short strong guy, what's your name? <br/>Russell. I'm not here for the money. I'm only here to show people how easy it is to win this game. I plan on making it as miserable as possible. I think if I can control how they feel, I can control how they think. She's going first. Whatever I want, happens. I'm telling you the truth. Are you telling me I'm not honest? You come up to me and threaten me, you got to go. <br/>What's he doing in there? <br/>I'm looking for the immunity idol. How many people found the idol without a clue? Boo-ya. That easy. Oh, my God. I ain't finished playing just yet. <br/>Probst: Russell, grunting it out! Russell has Brett! Russell wins the final individual immunity challenge. <br/>I said from day one, I was gonna get here. I was born for this. This is what God made me for. [cheering]  Probst: We're gonna settle that. that. [band plays upbeat rock music] [band plays upbeat rock music] Welcome back to  the Survivor: Samoa Live Reunion Show. Russell, Russell, Russell. First, let's pick up. What did we decide about the $10,000 offer? <br/>That's up to her. <br/>I'm going to decline Russell's offer. <br/>Good job. <br/>Yeah! <br/>In order... [applause and cheering]  Probst: All right, so you're not interested in giving him the title? <br/>I'm not interested. In order to win the title of sole survivor...  I'll give you $100,000. <br/>No, it's priceless. You have to get majority of the votes of the jury, so...  Probst: Wow! Let me just say, let me just point this out. There are two words up for debate-- sole survivor. $100,000 just turned down for those two words. You're all crazy. [laughter] All right, Russell. I would have taken that money. I'll call you sole survivor for 100 grand the rest of your life. What's been the reaction on the street to you? Because you're one of the most polarizing players we've ever had on the show. [applause and cheering]  Right, it's crazy, because, uh, at first, people hated me. You know, I might have been the most hated of all times. Now it seems like millions of people love me for... I don't know how that  happened, but it happened. <br/>Russell! <br/>And, uh, it's just... It's weird. <br/>Probst: What's the reaction from kids to you? Do they like you, generally? <br/>Well, my... I have twin girls. They're nine, in the fourth grade, and, uh, their whole school loves me. [laughter and cheering]  Probst: One of the... one of the things that got talked about this season  that completely surprised us from a producing point of view was you finding  idols without the clues. <br/>Yeah! [cheering]  Probst: Where did that...? It now seems like a very simple idea that, why not just go looking for clues? Where did that idea come from? <br/>I just... I was playing the game so hard, I was so focused, I just thought  that they had to have an idol somewhere. And I looked for a long time. It just... it doesn't seem like I do, but I looked for a long time for all of  them. And, uh, just kept looking until I found... you know, until I found it. <br/>Probst: Did we create a monster in you? I mean, you're really into Survivor,aren't you? <br/>This is serious. I take the game very, very serious, and I think that every... I thought that  I won the game for sure because I thought everybody took it so serious, but,  obviously, not. <br/>Probst: You made a comment out there, uh-- "your dumb-ass girl  alliance."  Mm-hmm. <br/>Mm. <br/>Probst: And you just talked about having two girls and a wife. You have three women in your family. What...? A lot of pe...  I have four women. <br/>Probst: Four women. <br/>My mom, too. [laughter]  Probst: So a lot of women were offended by that comment. Any regrets on it? <br/>There's no regrets how I played the game. I don't regret anything that I did. [applause and cheering]  Probst: Because, I mean, leave it to me to say, one of those dumb-ass girls  beat your ass for a million dollars. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. [applause and cheering] [applause and cheering] Let's go out here for a  minute. I want to say hello and answer a question I think a lot of people have... is  this question. Who marries Russell? [laughter] Melanie, you're Russell's wife? <br/>Yes. Well...  Probst: What is it about this guy that, uh, made you say yes? <br/>Well, like you even said, Jeff, he's very charming. And believe it or not, I mean, no matter all the negative things he's done on  the show, he's actually a great guy and a great father. And I love him. <br/>Oh. [applause and cheering]  Probst: All right, up next, one of these players up here is going to win  $100,000 courtesy of Sprint. But first, bringing us to break, our composers David Vanacore and Russ Landau. [cheering] [cheering] [band plays upbeat music] [band plays upbeat music]  Probst: A big battle on the ground. Ben, stop! Ben out of the challenge! [whooping] The first time in the history of Survivor,somebody's been pulled  out of a challenge. You're done. <br/>Outlaw, baby. [applause and cheering] [applause and cheering] [band plays upbeat music]  [band plays upbeat music]  Probst: Welcome back to the Survivor: Samoa Live Reunion Show. Ben, just so I can feel safe going home tonight, are you and I okay? <br/>We're cool, buddy. <br/>Probst: Okay. All right, well since Thursday, viewers have been texting and voting online  for the Sprint Player Of the Season. The votes are in, and we're going to now award the $100,000. Here are the three top vote-getters, in no particular order. Russell. Evil Russell. [cheering] Shambo. [cheering] The underdog. And Brett. And Brett. [cheering] [cheering]  Probst: Brett, it is not you. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Brett is out. We are down to two. Russell and Shambo. The winner of the Sprint Player of the Season award and the $100,000 goes to  Russell. $100,000 goes to Russell. [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause] Mick. Mick, you just shook Russell's hand. What do you make of this? You're a smart guy. The audience just voted the player of the season, Russell. Natalie wasn't in the top three. <br/>I mean, you can't argue with--  Probst: How do you make this mix of two different things going on? <br/>It's hard. It's hard to reconcile the fact that, like, you know, he was the bad guy, but  he played like nobody else played. Like he said, finding idols. He did mastermind a lot of this stuff, and so I mean you can't argue that. It was fantastic. It was great to watch. <br/>Probst: I want to do a couple of quick updates and see how people are doing. Mike Borassi, you also were evacuated from this game, fortunately not as  serious as Russell's. How are you doing? <br/>Good, and I didn't cry on camera either, so...  Probst: Wow. There is no mercy here. <br/>I'm just kidding. No, I'm fine. <br/>Probst: And you've lost a lot of weight, I can tell. <br/>Yeah, I lost about 65 pounds. [cheers and applause]  Probst: Ashley, I was touched to hear that this experience for you actually  brought you a lot closer to your father. <br/>Yes. That's very... --  Probst: Why is that? <br/>That's true. We always watch every season together, and then me getting on the show was  just one of the best experiences. We watch it every week and we have our favorites and it's just really great  to be even closer to him. <br/>Probst: Monica, you kind of slid through this game and you were actually, you  know, at one point Russell said, "Had Monica and I met early or day one,  we would have been the powerhouse." This experience for you, more than  you bargained for? <br/>I think it was an amazing experience. It was an awesome growth opportunity. And, I mean, it was a great journey. I learned tons about myself, and I don't regret anything. <br/>Probst: Yasmin, you, coincidentally, are sitting next to the guy that you  really didn't get along with too well out there. <br/>Yes, I am. Yeah, you know what? I came here expecting to have a problem with Ben but when I think of my  childhood and my wonderful parents, I know that I was raised to forgive. Definitely not to forget, but I forgive Ben for all the things that he said. I do. [cheers and applause]  Probst: Betsy.
