<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously, on Survivor:At Drake, being  undefeated had its drawbacks. <br/>I'm saying that a little more help would be appreciated. <br/>It's starting to get annoying because we really want  somebody to leave. <br/>Probst: At Morgan, the tide was up and spirits were down. <br/>I think it's us against everything else out here. <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge, Osten almost drowned. <br/>I need help! <br/>Probst: While Andrew and Ryno saved him, Drake won their  sixth straight victory. Drake wins reward! In the dark of night, Burton approached Rupert with a plan. <br/>At some point, we should lose. We can do it, but we have to get rid of Christa. <br/>He's a traitor. If this was a pirate culture, he'd already be dead. <br/>Probst: Reluctant to go along with the plan, Rupert sat  out while his tribe threw the immunity challenge. Morgan wins immunity! But a surprise twist allowed Morgan to kidnap one Drake member  until the next challenge. Who's it going to be, Savage? <br/>Rupert. <br/>Probst: Rupert became a temporary member of the Morgan  Tribe. <br/>It's all good. <br/>Probst: Back at Drake, Jon was playing both sides of the  fence. <br/>I got a five-way alliance with Trish, Rupert, Christa and  Sandra. And I have a four-way alliance with Shawn, Burton and Michelle. I'm a freakin' puppet master. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Burton's plan to throw the  immunity challenge backfired, when the majority of his tribe, including his  ally Shawn, voted him out. 12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? [theme song playing] Well, well, well. <br/>Well, well, well. I know what Shawn wrote on his card. <br/>My card said "Burton." [Jon chuckles]  Shawn's card did say "Burton." Last night, en  route to Tribal Council, I looked over at Shawn and I said, "I got a  little information for you. Burton's gone. Vote however you want. I suggest you write 'Burton.'" [laughs]  I had a core alliance which consisted of myself, Burton,  Michelle and, I thought, Jon. I've always been a little weary of Burton, and, um, to be honest  with you, I've been looking for a way to get rid of him. Hey, listen, Burton annoyed me more than... more than you think. [Jon laughs]  Oh, I find that hard to believe. <br/>Do you really? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Well, then, you're wrong, because he did. <br/>The joke to me was Shawn just starts trashing Burton. I was insulted. You know, it's like, "How stupid do you think we are?"  I mean, you were with him for 13 days. <br/>He thought he was better than everyone else on this tribe,  and that bothered me. We were tight, but you know what? This is not a game about tight, this is a game about strategy,  and for me, he was going to get voted out, regardless. So, I placed the vote, and I shocked a couple of people who had  no idea I was going to do it. 'Cause he was constantly wanting people to do, it his way,  Burton's way. Y-You know, it's like, well, hello? There's more than one person here. Michelle is the one right now who's clinging for her life,  because everyone knows she voted against Christa. And the other person who voted against Christa's no longer here. <br/>Michelle, everyone here knows what name you wrote on that  card. I want you to know it doesn't matter. It doesn't. It really doesn't. <br/>They're saying, "Oh, now everything's fine." I'm  like, "Everything's fine?"  Good night. <br/>Good night. I'm in trouble. I am out here completely by myself. <br/>When I first got to the Morgan camp, the beach was  pounding away at their shelter. The surf is coming up, and they don't realize that, as the moon  is changing, the tide's going to raise another two or three feet. And they're using logs to try and stop the tide from taking  their shelter away. It's not going to work. You need to tear your shelter down and rebuild your shelter  today. <br/>Yeah. Right now, we decided to go ahead and move our shelter, 'cause,  according to Rupert, by the time the full moon comes, it's going to... it  would have destroyed that shelter, with the waves and stuff. And just kind of clear some of this stuff out. So, we're going to move our shelter 40 feet inland, more towards  the jungle. <br/>What... how is this going to be set up, now? This is absurd. We haven't actually got hit by the water yet, so, my thought's,  "Wait till it becomes a problem, then deal with it." But they think  it's a state of emergency. <br/>So, what do you think? <br/>Looks good. O.T. said, "Why don't we just move it straight back, instead of  all the way over here?"  Up here to right here. <br/>I mean, that's a smart idea he had, just move it right  here. And this whole fire needs to get moved. <br/>Right this second? <br/>There are reasons not to do it over there? <br/>But if you guys want it over there, and it's a unanimous  vote... well, not a unanimous vote, but...  I just don't agree with moving it close to the jungle. We'll get destroyed by mosquitoes, "A," and then potentially  get lit up by a snake, "B."  Osten was pretty aggravated, because he was just wanting  to move it up from where we were at. But that way, we're going to have to dig up the whole fire pit  and move all the logs. <br/>Oh. <br/>These guys work very hard at not working. They fight and argue and bicker and bitch amongst each other so  much that I know why it takes them hours to do anything. I know why they don't really do great in the challenges. I know why they're not really a great team. <br/>Make a vote, I guess. Who's for here? <br/>Osten, he had an idea, and everybody kind of shot it down. We're going to move our shelter a little bit inland, more  towards the jungle, a little bit higher ground. <br/>Let's go. <br/>It's kind of like remodeling a house with four bad walls. <br/>I want a can of something. a house with four bad walls. <br/>I want a can of something. <br/>Well, don't we have an extra can of Spam? <br/>Yeah. <br/>We do? [mutters] Are we going to wait for Rupert before we open that? <br/>Yep. <br/>I hope we get him back. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Rupert right now is with the Morgan Tribe. He's got to sort of hang out with the enemy and get to know them  a little bit. My concern with Rupert is that I'm afraid he's giving away too  much information about us and not realizing it. <br/>Well, you know they're telling that the Morgans are just  like... [scoffs] "You're... you're safe with us." You know,  anything in the world. <br/>Buttering him up? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I want Rupert back, 'cause I want to find out what all  happened over there, what they talked about, um, if he gave out any pertinent  information... Everybody's kind of, um, tripping. They don't know if Rupert went to the other side. <br/>Three days is a long time to spend with another tribe. <br/>I've been dying of thirst since I've been here. I've been hungry since I've been here. Maybe, at least for lunch, I can get a... a belly full of fish. <br/>Rupert, you see all those fish jumping out there? I think they're waiting for you. <br/>I know they are. I'm hoping to take Ryan out there, and I'll swim around with him  and just kind of be his buddy and see if he can go catch a fish. <br/>I thought you had to throw it down, and...  No, no. No throwing. Get it in the crotch of your hand. Get it cocked, dive down, get under a rock. <br/>That's incredible. Thank God we got you over here, 'cause I had no... no idea on  that, how that sling deal worked. <br/>Ryno? Nice young kid, very willing to learn, wanting to be the  provider. Not knowing how to do the providing. Willing to learn on the spear. Willing to go out with me. I'm very comfortable with him. Let's open the bag. I'm very comfortable with him. Let's open the bag. [Rupert yells]  We had one beautiful one that was almost in the bag,  and... Ryan lost it, and... I screamed real loud at him, and... I feel bad  for him. <br/>We let one go. It was about this big... or I did. <br/>Why'd you let it go? <br/>I didn't let him go, I was trying to get him off the  spear. <br/>He tell you about the ones that got away? These make it better. <br/>Nicely done, fellow! [laughing] Nicely done. <br/>Rupert's been a godsend. He's an absolute workaholic, work ethic is impeccable. <br/>We eat a little lunch. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>I got to... I got to clean and gut them, so...  We'll make... we'll make some lunch. <br/>Ah! Mmm...  Ah, thank you, baby. <br/>Probably the smartest thing this tribe ever did was get a  hold of Rupert. [chuckles]  We got tree mail. [chuckles]  We got tree mail. <br/>Tree mail? <br/>"Paddle on the clue, does it give it all away? Or the foreshadowing of a part of what you'll face today. Running through the jungle for the best reward yet, staying dry  when you want to, get cleaner when you're wet." [gasps]  That tree mail, I'm really excited. <br/>It mentioned there's a possibility we would be clean  somehow. So we figured we would potentially get something that would dry  us off and then something that would keep us clean. <br/>I love Drake, and I don't really want to beat them, but I  want to beat them bad and show them, you know, the reason that they've been  winning might have something to do with me. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. Take a spot on your mat. Morgan, getting your first look at the new Drake Tribe. Rupert, getting your first look at your tribe without Burton. For the time being, you're still with Morgan. All right, let's get to it. For today's reward challenge, you will paddle out in boats to a  series of four wooden crates. At each crate, one tribe member will dive down and retrieve two  pieces to a ladder. Once you have all eight pieces, you'll paddle back and begin to  assemble the ladder. The ladder is a puzzle. Each rung has a different shaped end. Fit the ends into the holes in the sides to complete the ladder. At the same time, one member from each tribe will split off,  race deep into the jungle to an old Spanish well where you will retrieve a  golden idol sitting at the bottom of the well. Once you have your ladder assembled and you have the golden idol  in your hand, one tribe member will race up the ladder. First tribe to get their golden idol at the top of the pedestal  wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Hell, yeah. <br/>Probst: It's a water reward. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Several items: portable shower, pot for boiling  water, two jerricans for transporting water, rain jackets, loofah, sponges,  shampoo, conditioner, everything you need to get clean, and if Morgan should  win, we still have the first piece to your buried treasure. Drake has already found theirs and enjoyed it. In addition, for the winning tribe, a chance to loot from the  other tribe, something Morgan has yet to enjoy. Drake knows how delicious that can be. A lot at stake. Wait for my "Go." Here we go guys, for reward. Survivors ready. Go! Drake out first. Morgan right behind. <br/>We're gaining. <br/>Probst: Drake having a lot of trouble steering their boat. Morgan at box number one, Rupert in for Morgan. Morgan has their first pieces. Drake at box number one. Shawn diving down. Morgan on to their second box. Drake still trying to get to their second box. <br/>Let's go! <br/>Probst: Morgan looking for the set of puzzle pieces. [indistinct shouting] Rupert doing a heck of a job for Morgan. Shawn dives down looking for more. [indistinct chatter]  Start going, guys! <br/>Probst: Morgan with a big lead. <br/>Come on, you got to steer port. <br/>I am steering port. <br/>You're steering the wrong way. <br/>Probst: Drake is completely out of course. <br/>To the other side, yeah. <br/>On the right side! <br/>Right side, hard. <br/>Right side. <br/>Hard, guys. <br/>Probst: Morgan is at their last two puzzle pieces. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Drake working their way back on to the course. Jon is using the rudder as a paddle and not to steer. [grunts] Morgan has all eight puzzle pieces. Turning around and heading back. Morgan racing back to the finish. Drake, still in the middle of the course, looking for their  third set of puzzle pieces. [indistinct shouting] Drake has six pieces now, looking for  their last two. Drake is at their last two puzzle pieces. Once you hit the sand, you can get out. [indistinct chatter] Through the course, Andrew. Through the checkpoint. Andrew off to the Spanish well. <br/>Left, everybody! Everybody on the left! <br/>Come on, Jon. [indistinct shouting]  Left! Left! <br/>Probst: Drake finally working their way back to shore. [indistinct chatter] Morgan still with a big lead. Don't blow it on the ladder. <br/>Go! <br/>Run, run! <br/>Probst: Through the checkpoint, Michelle, and around the  other flag. Let's go, Drake. Welcome to the contest. <br/>Get on that end...  Probst: Andrew back with the idol. [indistinct chatter] Drake, glad you could join us. <br/>Oh, oh. <br/>Probst: Morgan has it assembled, putting the cotter pins  in. Michelle deep in the jungle looking for an idol that's not going  to matter. Andrew has the idol in hand, ladder going up against the tower. <br/>Go! Go! <br/>Probst: Savage gets the honor. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: And just like that...  Oh! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Morgan wins reward! Two challenges in a row! <br/>Yeah! Give me a hug. <br/>Probst: Morgan, congratulations. Two challenges in a row. Very valuable. Your first piece to your buried treasure. The water reward will be waiting for you back at camp, which  means, Rupert, if you want to shower and shampoo and all that stuff, you can  go back to Morgan, indulge, and then return to Drake, or if you want, skip  the reward, go back to Drake now. [applause]  I love you guys, but I want to go home. <br/>Probst: Okay, one other thing. Select one tribe member that will get to visit Drake's camp, and  help yourself to one of their items. Drake, head back. <br/>This was the first time that I've seen the Drake Tribe nervous. The first challenge that we just really smoked those guys. A lot of it was Rupert, but if you saw us in the boat, the  Morgan Tribe was perfectly in sync. We're on a high. We've proven to ourselves that we can win. And I think that's... In this game, it's a mental game, and  that's critical. <br/>I haven't smelled something that smells so good in a long  while. <br/>I just cannot wait to wash my body. It just... I just feel like the nastiest person on Earth right  now. <br/>I don't care much for smells like this back home, but,  smells really good. <br/>We have a hanging portable shower that we're going to  latch up to, a... a palm tree. Take five gallons, and everyone's going to shower. It's absolutely fabulous. <br/>The shower worked out fine. I think the guys respected us, you know. They wasn't really watching us, so, um, you know, I respect them  for respecting us. So, you know, if they'll do that every time I take a shower, I'm  fine with it. <br/>The Morgan Tribe seems to be riding a high, and it's...  it's great. I... I like that. It's... it's a positive attitude. <br/>None of us knew how to steer. <br/>I should have been in the back. <br/>And you stepped up to the plate and said that you would. <br/>But, more importantly, welcome back this guy. <br/>Yeah. I love being back home. When Jeff said, "You can enjoy your bounty or go  home," there wasn't even a question. I didn't look back. I come home. I didn't need to go share in the loot. I need to go bond with my tribe. <br/>How was Jenny Craig Island? [laughs]  Hey, come and tell us, what's going on over there? <br/>Yeah, what's going on over there? <br/>A hand full of rice was your meal. They have almost no food. <br/>They... they can only take one thing. <br/>They have two meals of beans left and two meals of rice  left, and that's all they have left. Osten doesn't get in the water, doesn't go in the jungle, doesn't  get water, doesn't grab firewood. <br/>Did they try to recruit you the whole time? <br/>They knew I was not going anywhere. They know that a Drake is going to win this whole damn thing. [indistinct chatter] Thank God, I am so happy I am back. <br/>Oh, you been missed, man. <br/>You're gonna eat good, too, you're gonna eat good. <br/>You been missed big time. <br/>You're gonna eat good. <br/>Here they come, guys. <br/>This should be very interesting. <br/>I think he's coming with a peace offering. <br/>Big Jon. What's up? <br/>Welcome to Drakeland. <br/>Good to see you. <br/>Hey, this is from everyone. <br/>Good to see you. You can take whatever the ... you want. <br/>All right. <br/>But I'm going to show you what I want you to take. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay? <br/>I'm with you, brother. We have about this much rice left, and that's it, so I'm going  to take a bag of rice. <br/>How much rice do you guys have at your place? I never even looked. You got about this much? <br/>Probably half. <br/>You got about half of this? <br/>Yeah. Honestly. <br/>I know. You can say, "This is good." You can say, "Give  me more." You can say, "Give me that."  I can take that whole thing? <br/>Yeah. Of course, I'll kill you...  I wouldn't do that. You know I wouldn't do that. <br/>Right. Do you want me to pour you a little more rice in here? I will. I poured two more bowls full of rice in his bag, and he was  happy. That truly was not a looting. That was friends helping friends. <br/>All right, you guys, I got to go. <br/>Okay. <br/>Thanks so much. <br/>Tell everybody hey. <br/>Yeah. <br/>There is probably a lot of danger in being too much in  control of both tribes. Who knows what my own tribe even thinks of me, but if I push too  hard, I will end up alienating someone. <br/>Thanks, guys, so much. <br/>See you later. <br/>Okay, see you later. <br/>Good luck. Tell everybody we said hi. <br/>All right. I think this speaks volumes on diplomacy, and, uh, there'll be  no hard feelings, because I'm hoping, ultimately, in the next handful of  days, to be part of their tribe. <br/>Got to love the sea mail, huh? Uh-oh. We got something. All right, here it comes. "The ocean yields you lots of treats. Some pay a fortune for what you guys eat. So prepare yourself for a seafood feast. Down it all and earn three more days at least." We eating,  folks! <br/>It looks like, for this immunity challenge, they're going  to blender up all kinds of crazy stuff from the ocean, and we're going to  have to drink it. This is going to be my toughest challenge, because I'm just not  good at that kind of stuff. <br/>Hold your nose, and...  Right. <br/>Don't breathe and don't stop. <br/>That's really true. I don't really have too many problems with eating disgusting  things. Actually, I don't really have a problem at all. <br/>Hey, who's the least likely for them to think they eat? <br/>If someone has to go twice, Michelle seems pretty darn  prepared. Just have her act like it's the worst thing in the world versus  Trish so they pick her instead of Trish. <br/>So, my plan for the challenge is to play it up and act  like I really hate it and just, you know, try to be all girly-girl about it. <br/>What we're thinking is the other tribe is going to have to  pick one person to drink twice, so we're going to make her be a decoy for all  of us. <br/>He needs bandaging. He's hurt. <br/>Bring him to the challenge. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. What's going on, Drake? <br/>Morning. <br/>Probst: What's going on, Morgan? Rupert, who is the new tribe member? <br/>This is Balboa. I found him in the ocean just barely hanging on. So we bandaged him up, and we're going to keep him as our  mascot. <br/>Balboa. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to today's immunity  challenge. First things first. Thank you, Savage. Immunity back up for grabs. Welcome to the Survivor smoothie bar. <br/>Oh. <br/>Awesome. [laughing]  Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: The spinning wheel has been divided into 12  sections. Each section represents an ingredient that we will use in our  smoothies. We have sardines, red shellfish, mango, octopus, razor clams,  rock oysters, squid, conch, coconut juice, sea water, bleeding clam and my  favorite, Jeff's special, where I get to mix up a little something for you  guys. <br/>Somethin', somethin'. <br/>Probst: One at a time, tribe members will come up. I'll spin the wheel. You will each roll a ball. They will land on two different ingredients. We'll mix those ingredients. You'll slug it down. It's not a race. You just need to get it down. Morgan, because you are two members shy, first person and the  second person will have to drink two times. First two: Savage, Sandra, come on up. [cheering] Spot right here. Roll 'em. Sardine and bleeding clam. All right. Bleeding clam. Mm. <br/>That's disgusting. <br/>We like clams. We like clams. <br/>Probst: Boy, I can smell that. <br/>I'm ready. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one, go. <br/>Oh, God! <br/>Go, Andrew! Probst: That'll do. <br/>You got it, girl. Keep it going now. Keep it going. <br/>Nasty. <br/>You can do it. You can do it. <br/>You'll be stronger after this. <br/>I'm going to be sick after this. <br/>Probst: That a way, Sandra, keep going. [clapping and cheering]  Yeah! <br/>Oh, that was hell. <br/>Great! <br/>Probst: Both tribes score. Have a seat. <br/>We love you! <br/>Probst: Michelle, Ryno, come on up. <br/>Michelle's looking the least forward to this out of every  one of us. <br/>Probst: Michelle and Ryno, roll them! What do we have? Oh, Jeff's special. <br/>Oh. <br/>Probst: Razor clam and Jeff's special. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: Jeff's special means I can pretty much put  whatever I want in here. And I'm feeling colorful today. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>Probst: Razor clams are first. <br/>I've never had a clam before. <br/>Probst: I am loving the octopus. <br/>Oh! <br/>We love octopus. Extra tentacles. <br/>That's humongous. <br/>Probst: That's, uh, that's eight arms coming out of his  head is what that is. <br/>Sick. <br/>Probst: I'll tell you, red shellfish is really good. <br/>Oh! Sick. <br/>One hell of a smell. <br/>Probst: Wait till you taste it. <br/>The Oreo cookie shake. That's what that is. <br/>Ew. <br/>Probst: One Jeff's special coming up. <br/>All right, Michelle. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one, go! <br/>Michelle, go, girl, go! <br/>Yeah, Ryno! <br/>Go Ryno! <br/>Let's go, Michelle. You got it. <br/>Probst: Michelle having no problem. <br/>Yeah, girl! <br/>Yeah! Drink it, baby! [clapping and cheering]  Kicked my ass. <br/>Probst: That'll work. <br/>Good job, Ryno, good job. <br/>Probst: Nicely done. <br/>All right, Michelle! <br/>Probst: Morgan scores, Drake scores. We're two-two. [Michelle burps] [laughing] Next two, Jon, Darrah. Jon, let me ask you a question. What is this about? This is... this is... that's-that's Jonny Fairplay right there. That's the "F." That's the "Y." I'm all in  between. Jonny Fairplay. I play fair. No-no cheating. <br/>Probst: All right. Here we go. Roll them! Conch and coconut juice. <br/>Hey, actually, we might eat some funky stuff, so if you  want to kiss before, that's cool. <br/>No, I think I'll pass. <br/>All right. <br/>Probst: What are the odds, if you didn't have a boyfriend,  what chance would he have? <br/>Nothing. [laughing] No offense. <br/>No offense, but none. <br/>To you, baby. <br/>All right, drink it up, Jon. Yeah! Whoo! <br/>Probst: Jon's good. Darrah, taking her time, no rush. <br/>Thinking of me? Don't go... [mock-retching] [Rupert laughs]  Probst: Nice job. We are even. Three-three. <br/>Very good! <br/>Probst: Next two. Christa, Osten. Roll it! Squid and rock oyster. <br/>Blah! [laughing]  Probst: Nicely done, you freak. Next two. Trish, T. Roll 'em. Jeff's special and a little squid. <br/>Ooh, goodie! <br/>Probst: Drink. <br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah! <br/>Probst: Fighting through it. <br/>Yes! We are even, five-five. Shawn and Savage, you're going again now. Jeff's special and red shellfish. <br/>You got it. <br/>Probst: Nicely done. Nicely done. We're at six-six. Ryno, you're up again for Morgan. And the big man. <br/>Yay, I get to eat. <br/>Probst: Sardines and rock oyster. Cheers. That'll work. We're tied at seven-seven. We're now going into a tiebreaker round. This will be a timed trial. That is, the first person to finish their drink wins immunity  for their tribe. Drake, who's it going to be for Morgan? <br/>Darrah. <br/>Yeah, Darrah. <br/>Probst: Darrah, come on down. Morgan, who's it going to be from Drake? <br/>Sandra. <br/>Probst: Sandra. <br/>You can do it, baby. <br/>You can do it. <br/>Probst: First ingredient, conch. <br/>Lord help me. <br/>Probst: Little bit of rock oyster. Need a little bleeding clam. I want a hit of squid. <br/>No! <br/>Probst: Sea water. <br/>Aw, that's going to be terrible. <br/>Probst: Now for the garnish, which you must eat. First person who gets it down wins. Here's what's at stake: immunity, three more days out here. For the losing tribe, you're going to Tribal Council tonight. Somebody going home. Three, two, one, go! <br/>You can do it! You can do it! <br/>Come on, Darrah. <br/>You can do it, Sandra! <br/>All right, Darrah. <br/>Probst: Keep going, Darrah, get it down. Swallow. That's it. <br/>You got it, Sandra. This is cake. <br/>Come on, just throw it down as fast as you can. <br/>Probst: That a way, guys, you're doing great. Gulp it, Darrah. Gulp it down. That a way, Sandra. That a way to fight. Darrah, moving on to the sardine. Get it down, get it down. It's a race. Get it down, Sandra. Let's go, Darrah. Both women trying to get the sardines down, scales and all. Sandra's came back up. Twice it's come back up. Keep catching it, Sandra. You're still alive. <br/>Swallow that bad boy! <br/>Swallow the other piece! Hurry up! [excited shouting]  Probst: Swallow! Show me. <br/>Turn to Jeff! <br/>Probst: Let me see it. Morgan! Good! [cheering] Immunity! [cheering] Morgan takes immunity back home again. Safe from the vote tonight. Three more days on the island. Great effort by Drake. Not enough. Somebody going home tonight. You guys have this afternoon to think about it. I'll see you at Tribal Council. <br/>I just hate that it's my I'll see you at Tribal Council. <br/>I just hate that it's my fault we're going to go to Tribal  Council tonight. <br/>You did beautiful. <br/>I am so worried because I feel like it's my fault that we  lost the immunity challenge. I just couldn't get the sardine down. Why did they have to pick me? <br/>I don't know, man. I should have played it up more. <br/>And so, I feel when we go to Tribal Council tonight that,  why shouldn't I be the one going home if this is all my fault? Nobody wants to be the cause of the tribe going to Tribal  Council. <br/>Dude, it doesn't matter. It's okay. I mean, you did your best. That's all you can do, right? <br/>All of that is easy to say when you're not on the chopping  block. Lord have mercy. <br/>I'm pissed the ... off. That was the easiest... challenge we, easiest challenge we'll  have the entire ... game. I feel like the last immunity challenge was mind over matter. Obviously, a sardine is bigger than Sandra's mind. Secondly, I'm extremely pissed off at Michelle. Michelle was planning on pretending as though she would be the  worst in the bunch when in reality she was technically the best. <br/>I almost fell off my chair when she chugged that thing. The plan was she was supposed to gag that down. <br/>But her freakin' ego wouldn't let her do it, and, uh...  that's what I feel about her ego right now. <br/>You and I know about these physical challenges. You know what I mean? <br/>Yep. <br/>Michelle can run. <br/>I know. But this isn't the time right now to talk about it. <br/>I know, but you know what I'm saying. <br/>I know. <br/>I'm thinking about winning. We need to. <br/>We're back two damn minutes, and he's already trying to  get somebody out. He better watch out, or it'll be him. <br/>What are you thinking about? [grunts] I know majority goes me. I'm-I'm just having big problems. It just, it bothers me that... we have maybe one more challenge  before the merge, and Shawn, who is, you know, just... I can't trust him  further than I could throw him. <br/>You know, they say that he did something when I'm gone. But when I'm here, he does nothing, and he eats more than  anybody. He does nothing. [gagging] What could we say to convince people to vote for Shawn  and convince them that we don't need the damn strength of Shawn 'cause he's  not that strong anyway? [coughing]  There's, like, one more challenge. <br/>Michelle feels like she is going. She is trying to make a plea that she works as hard, if not  harder, than Shawn, and she eats lots less. She never takes more than her share. <br/>My point is that once the merge comes, which will happen  really soon...  I know. <br/>...it just doesn't seem to make sense to me that people  would want him around at the merge rather than myself. <br/>She swayed me enough that I will mention it to others. Do we want to take Shawn out of this game? It's day 15-- he was our first pick on day two. <br/>Probst: What a difference a pick on day two. <br/>Probst: What a difference a few days can make. In the last four days, you've lost three challenges and, by the  end of the night, two members. Sandra... you got selected to be in the tiebreaker. Gave it a great effort. It wasn't enough. Are you worried that it might be you tonight? <br/>If it's me, I know why. Then I'll deal with it. I'm just sorry. That's all I can say. <br/>Probst: Is this tribe starting to splinter a little bit? Is that a fair assessment, losing this many challenges in a row? <br/>No. We-we didn't expect to lose this challenge here. And I've apologized to the tribe a couple of times today because  of the fact that I didn't pull through it. We didn't even plan to lose this challenge but, you know, things  happen. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about the challenges since we-we jumped  to that. Let's go back to the last reward challenge. From where I'm looking at it, Jon, you didn't know if you had a  rudder or a paddle or what to do with it. Was that discussed among the tribe, or was that just an  observation I saw? <br/>Uh, the last reward challenge was the first challenge of  all the challenges that we actually lost, as far as, uh, we saw it. <br/>Probst: Okay, what do you mean, "as far as we saw  it"? 'Cause, we went through this charade last time. <br/>Well, last time, we felt, uh, that no one really needed to  know until it was time to be told, uh, what was really going on. <br/>Probst: So now that you've lost three in a row, you want  to come clean and say, "Well, we actually didn't lose the first one, we  threw it."  Yeah, absolutely. <br/>Probst: My point is, throwing a challenge in a game like  this is really cocky. Michelle, is there a part of you that, looking back now, says,  "You know, by throwing a challenge, we gave them the ability to believe  in themselves. Now we're the ones scrambling to get back, and they are the  powerhouse in their mind"? <br/>Uh, that's a load of crap. Um, I don't think that how much they built up themselves for  winning that one challenge and then continuing for two after that is enough  to keep on winning. Um, I don't expect that Drake will have to lose to Morgan again. <br/>When they decided to throw that damn challenge, I knew it  was the worst mistake in the world, but I could not convince them. If we would not have thrown that challenge, we would have not  lost the immunity. We would have not lost the rewards. I would have not had to go to Morgan. The one good thing about going to Morgan, I learned a lot about  them. If I can take what I learned and use it against them, then  maybe, you know, we got some good out of it. <br/>Probst: Fair enough. It is time to vote. Shawn. You're up. <br/>If anybody was going to jump ship, buddy, I think it's  you. Hope you don't. <br/>You're a good girl, but say Hope you don't. <br/>You're a good girl, but say hello to the bad guy. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. [man singing in foreign language]  Probst: Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Michelle. Shawn. Michelle. That's two votes Michelle. Michelle. That's three. Second person voted out of the Drake Tribe: Michelle. That's four votes. That's enough. Last two votes will remain a mystery. Michelle, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor: The Morgan Tribe has an  unexpected visitor. [screaming]  I don't like animals. I've been bit by a couple animals. [squawking]  Probst: And at Drake, tempers fly. <br/>No, what's ... ridiculous is not doing anything! <br/>Jon, just shut up, all right! <br/>Maybe Shawn should get a clue, or he's going home. <br/>I'm really upset that I came all this way, but it didn't  happen. I think I have learned stuff about myself. When things suck, and you're in crappy situations and being able  to carry through it. And I learned how much I can deal with. But regardless of all the politics, wish I could have been here  longer-- just had more time to kick some butt and really get into the game.
