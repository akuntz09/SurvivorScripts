<br/>Episode 10 -  <br/>Jeff: previously on "Survivor":  Jeff, I'm a former special agent. <br/>You are a crazy person. <br/>Jeff: Before the merge, both tribes were rife with  infighting. <br/>David under pressure is really stressing. <br/>You're wrong there. Don't even go there with that. I don't freak out. <br/>Jeff: But after the merge, the former Ometepe tribe and  the former Zapatera tribe set aside their internal squabbles but stayed  divided against each other. <br/>I want my group to hate Zapatera. <br/>Jeff: And Matt was caught between the two so Rob  immediately took him out. <br/>He can't be trusted so because of that, I'm giving him a  one-way ticket back to Redemption Island. <br/>What the hell, guys. <br/>Jeff: Down 6-5, the former Zapatera hatched a desperate  plan. <br/>We tossed around the idea of trying to see if we can woo  some of the Ometepe tribe. <br/>Jeff: At back-to-back tribal councils they tried to  convince the Ometepe low man to jump ship. David, of the six, who is on the bottom? <br/>We think Phillip. <br/>Jeff: But Phillip wouldn't budge and played the honor and  duty card. <br/>I served in the united states army and had the second  highest medal they give during peace time. <br/>Give it up. <br/>I don't have to give it up. <br/>You sound like a lunatic. <br/>Phillip never ceases to amaze me. <br/>Jeff: So Mike was voted out. The tribe has spoken. And so was David. You will now head to Redemption Island where you will have a  chance to get back in the game. All right. <br/>Jeff: Good luck. Now Ralph, Julie, and Steve face a united Ometepe tribe while  for the first time three competitors face a duel on Redemption Island. <br/>I can't sleep. I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to pull myself up by my  bootstraps and keep my sanity. I just licked my wounds and bleed for a little while and hurt,  but I was ready to kind of get in the mindset of all right, Redemption Island,  part two. Let's do it. And then curveball. <br/>God, my brother wouldn't quit. My dad wouldn't quit. You would never quit, lord jesus, and your spirit lives in me. <br/>To my arrival at Redemption Island Matt and Mike are both  still here so let's see if I can make some noise here and maybe get back into  the game. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Who is that? <br/>It's murphy, David murphy? <br/>What! <br/>I can't see anything. Where am I going? <br/>What in the world, man? What... David rolls up, and, I mean, my mind is completely blown  at this point. I don't know what to think. Like, we have no idea what's going on. There's no way they're-- we have to have a duel tomorrow. <br/>Duels now are all going to be three-person duels. <br/>Or what if there isn't-- I mean--  What if this is the last one? <br/>I guess if we're already all on the jury-- that's just  weird. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Can you-- can you have a duel between three people? <br/>That would be a trial. <br/>A trual. <br/>A trual? <br/>This is certainly an interesting choice. I have no idea what to make of it. Who knows what the other twist may be. We don't know if there will be a duel or what the duel will be  or who will be in it, so definitely look forward to see what's going on here. <br/>Good night, Zapatera. <br/>Good night, team Zapatera. <br/>The Zapatera rejects. <br/>Isn't the skin good? <br/>Yummy, huh? <br/>I'm glad my mood changed around. I was really happy dave went off instead of me. I wasn't ready to go yet. <br/>He didn't have much to say. <br/>No, the whole thing was occupied by phil. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Flapping his gums. <br/>Tribal council last night was six on 4, now six on three  against Ralph, Julie and I, and after dave's performed so well the last  couple of challenges, we lose dave. And we just threw all four of ours at Rob and womp-womp. <br/>And I just haven't really figured Phillip out. I can't imagine somebody always being that strange. Pretty much everything he does bugs us, but the rest of Ometepe  are sticking to him like glue. Boston Rob's got them all very tight. I'm not sure if Phillip is even a good guy at heart, but he's  doing his thing. He's out here surviving. I take my hat off to him. The only hope we can hang our hat on is how irritated they could  be with Phillip. There's always a chance. <br/>When I got into buddhism, one of the things that you learn  is your spirit is interconnected to every single living thing, including the  tathagata, which you might call god or allah or buddha. It will manifest itself in a number of different ways. You can hear it. You can feel it. And you just have to be willing to accept it for what it is and  channel that. I did a meditation this morning. I was focusing on my ancestors. You know, I had a premonition through my grandfather and I took  that as an indication that as my relationship with Rob. I think it has finally come to what I call the full circle of  trust. And I'm going to play my role. That doesn't mean I'm not pursuing the million dollars because  I'll be here at the end of the game. <br/>It's ready. Do you want to eat it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>The food situation for the old Zapatera tribe is-- is  great. We have a ton of rice left. And we're eating it. <br/>There's so much rice left. <br/>Pretty good. <br/>And we're just going to eat and enjoy and at least we  won't be hungry. The hunger has been tough but we're happy now. We're happy in the food field. <br/>You good? <br/>Yeah, I'm good. <br/>You were just eating to finish it? <br/>I wouldn't want it to go to waste. <br/>Life's pretty good, man. <br/>The rice situation is pretty ugly. This morning, Julie was able to scoop seven and a half scoops of  rice out of that cooked pot. In our old tribe we would have two of those sea shells, one,  two. Done. <br/>I want to figure out a way to get even. <br/>I contend that she's trying to use up the rice before they  go. <br/>I plan on scooping quite a bit of rice out of their tin  and putting it in ours. The fact of the Matter is all rice here belongs to all of us. <br/>Phillip is the rice police. <br/>I'm now watching the Zapatera like a lion. It's trivial. But, apparently, that's the state of the world today and  murlonio tribe. <br/>Please be tree mail. Please be tree mail. <br/>We got something. <br/>Yay! <br/>"As comfortable as you all may be, it's time again  for you all to see a battle between those outcast who will leave and who will  last."  "Time again for all to see."  Sweet! <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the competitors for today's duel. Matt, Mike, and David. Welcome to Redemption Island arena. We invited the rest of the tribe to witness your duel. Matt, back-to-back blindsides. Where's your emotional state of mind right now? <br/>I never knew that strangers could hurt me so deeply. Um, I mean, I guess shame on me for letting them fool me twice,  you know. It hurts, but I'm ready to keep going if I can. <br/>Jeff: All right, should we get to today's duel? <br/>Yes. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: here's how it works. Each of you will have 150 wooden tiles. You will use those tiles to build a house of cards. The first two to reach eight feet stay alive. Loser is out for good and will become the first member of our  jury. <br/>Wooo! <br/>Jeff: You guys ready to get to this? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: This is it. One shot. Take your spots. All right, here we go. Survivors ready? Go. The only basic rule is you cannot stack these just flat one on  top of each other. You have to build a traditional house of cards. <br/>Jeff: Mike not messing around, right around the six-foot  mark. Matt around the five-foot mark. <br/>Oh, boy. <br/>Jeff: David hovering around three feet. This stack is so tall, Mike is now moving to the ladder. Getting closer and closer to that eight-foot mark. You don't have to be first. You just don't want to be last. Mike getting very close. <br/>Nice, Mike. <br/>Jeff: Almost there. One more stack will do it for Mike. If he can just remain calm. Matt doing very well. David catching up quickly. Mike is just short. This will do it. Gotta get that to lay on its own. Mike flirting with disaster, being very careful, does not want  to lose this stack. Not with Matt breathing down his neck and David right behind. David is now back in it. David's on his ladder. Matt getting closer. Mike has a very tall stack. Just doesn't want to lose it. Matt getting very close now to finishing. David getting closer to finishing. Mike is less than a half an inch away. Gotta reach the top of the post. If he can stack it and get his hands away and he does. Mike is good. Mike stays alive. Matt is very close. Can he do it right here? David trying to get in it. Matt does it. Mike and Matt stay alive! [ applause ]  Nice try, dave. <br/>Good challenge, everybody. <br/>Good try, David. <br/>Nice try, dave. <br/>Jeff: Mike, first duel, did what you had to do. You stay alive. <br/>It feels good. Thank you, Jeff, thank you. <br/>Jeff: Matt, seven straight duels you have stayed alive. Seizing that moment once again. David, after 25 very tough days in this game, your shot at the  money is over. You will return to the next tribal council as the first member  of our jury. You can toss your buff in the urn on your way out. <br/>Bye, David! [ applause ]  I saw Redemption Island as a chance to further myself in  the game. Unfortunately, my plan didn't work as well as I would like for  it to have. I think this has given me a really fresh outlook and  determination to tackle everything I want to do and just very appreciative  for that. <br/>David's going to be the first member of the jury. We'll try to send people to the duel to beat other people who  are already there-- namely, Matt. We sent Mike and we sent David, and David failed so Matt is  still in there. If he comes back and beats me, it's over. <br/>Jeff: Matt and Mike, congratulations. You're still alive in this game. You can head back to Redemption Island and await your next duel  and your next opponent. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Good job, you guys. <br/>See you, guys. <br/>God's continued to give me the strength day after day. He's given me new hope, and if it's his will, then I'll continue  to win. And try to take Rob out. <br/>I want, like, a pot. <br/>That's what I'm saying. <br/>Yeah, let's do it. we've got to eat more than the old Zapatera tribe rice rolls  we're going to eat ourselves out of house and home after one day rice wars. <br/>Hey! <br/>That was good, you guys. <br/>Oh, no. Rob, we have, like, maggots or something in here. <br/>What? <br/>I opened the rice, and I discovered that there were some  maggots. <br/>Sick. <br/>Phil decided he wanted to dump all the rice on to a  blanket. So we separated the maggots and we dumped the rest of the bad  rice into the ocean. <br/>Let's put it in their container and we'll just all use the  same container. <br/>They're not going to want to do that. I wouldn't want to do that if I were them. <br/>We have nowhere to put our rice. Our rice is on the blanket with all the bugs and dirt getting  into it. What are we going to eat for the rest of the time? <br/>Bon appetite. <br/>How nasty must that be. <br/>Our rice is all, like-- there's, like, maggots and mold in  it, so we just dumped out all the good rice and separated it. Could we put all of our rice in yours? <br/>No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think Ralph would go for it, either. <br/>I'll tell them. <br/>I don't think so, do you? <br/>No. <br/>It's an eye opener to see individuals behave the way they  are currently behaving, even in a "Game survivor" environment. So to me, you could pRobably leave here with some damages  potentially to see just how bad human beings will conduct themselves in an  environment like this. <br/>The other rice is perfectly fine. Our container had a leak in the bottom of it. It got wet and it molded, but the rice that's on that towel is  perfectly good rice. That's nothing wrong with it. <br/>We're going to have to talk about it. I'm going to talk about it with Ralph. <br/>Look, you guys aren't being reasonable. You should think about it logically. It's not a Zapatera decision. It's our rice. Anyway, I don't want to have this argument. Once the tribes merged, only the rewards are separate. That's the way it's done. <br/>Wouldn't it have been smart to talk about this before you  dumped it all out, Phillip? <br/>No, but I don't want to have that debate with you. I don't want to leave the rice outside of the container. I asked, unless you walk with that can, the first opportunity I  have to take that can and hide it, I will. <br/>So in other words you'd be threatening my tribe with  physically taking something. <br/>You're threatening the tribe right now by saying go ahead  and let that on the ground spoil. The longer it is out here moisture is getting to it. <br/>You [ bleep ]. <br/>I'll put it blunt to you. Unless you walk with that [ bleep ] can everywhere you go, I'm  going to put the rice in there and you will come ask me for the rice. I'm a very reasonable person to deal with. <br/>You're not reasonable at all, dude. You're a [ bleep ] lunatic. <br/>I know I am. That's the one thing you never want to forget. <br/>You're a dangerous man. <br/>You need to remember that. You need to keep that in your mindset. That's your perception, any time somebody of my color gets up in  one of your faces, then you feel like I'm a lunatic. I'm crazy. <br/>He just brought in the race card. <br/>Did he really? <br/>Now you're making it a black thing? <br/>Yeah, I think that's what this is all about between you  and me. You're the one raising the issue calling me a lunatic. <br/>Phillip--  Excuse me. <br/>You're bringing this to a black and white thing now? Wow. <br/>I made the argument we don't want to keep the rice outside  of that can and you told me I'm a bleep lunatic because I don't want to do  that. And that's not a rational argument. You make the decisions you need to make and I'll make the  decisions I need to make. Mano a mano if we have to. I'm the chief of counter-intelligence. Wang chung kung fu expert here. <br/>It's like watching divorce court. <br/>He feels like he's better than me, you know, and I think  it has some slight racial undertones to it. They're the ones that go to the next level to "You're  crazy." when he said that, I said, "Don't forget that. I am crazy."  He was over here just freaking out. <br/>I'm like a lot of black men. We're prepared to self-destruct at any moment because that's  what happens to a lot of black men. They do self-destruct, and bam, bam, bam, bam! I'm not looking to do anything like that. You don't start none, there won't be none. But if you start it I'm going to finish it because I don't feel  like I've got anything to lose because once they get on the jury they're not  going to vote for me. They're going to ask me, get down on their knees and beg for the  rice. "Please, let me have some rice, mr. Charlie."  Ralph, Ralph, he was making decisions for the tribe and  kept pushing the issue and then he took it to black and white, like we were  having some racial issue or something. <br/>I just noticed that every single time I make an issue with  the people of the former Zapatera tribe, suddenly a guy who is able to become  a federal agent--  Whatever. I don't want to hear it. <br/>Suddenly becomes [ bleep ] crazy. You now called me crazy. You are crazy. Every time I make that argument, suddenly I'm crazy. And that's what happens with some white folks. They like to take a black man and make them crazy when he makes  an argument that you don't want to hear. And you know what I've got to say about that? Right there, buddy. <br/>No, every time I make an argument with one of those guys  it's I'm [ bleep ] crazy. That's [ bleep ] crazy. Get out of my face with that. I'm tired of hearing that [ bleep ]. I'm tired of hearing that [ bleep ]. Every time I make an argument with somebody around here. That [ bleep ] has to be crazy. You don't know me. I've never been to jail. I've never been arrested. But suddenly I'm crazy on a little island with a couple of dudes  because I'm telling them hey, man, I have some bad rice. I want to put it in a good container. <br/>Crazy, crazy, phil being crazy phil, taking it to the  "N" word is pretty wacky. It's degrading. It's not a chip. It's a log on his shoulder. I'd just as soon turn my back and walk away from it. <br/>We're voting for phil tomorrow. Just a thought. <br/>He's a pain in the ass. He's a loose cannon. And a little scary, too. So the quicker we can get him out of here, I think the whole  tribe would be in better shape. <br/>Zero social skills. He's unstable, man. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Something like that doesn't last in the c.I.A., or any  investigation thing. <br/>Maybe that's why he's not working for them. <br/>Maybe he was discarded or something. <br/>I don't mind so much him picking on the other tribe, but  you can just see that once they're gone, that old Phillip's coming back. You know what I mean? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>What started off as a friendly little song between Grant  and I turned into an explosion. Phillip somehow managed to make a war about white rice racial. I don't know where it came from. It was uncomfortable. <br/>I was really uncomfortable. You know what, I was really uncomfortable with him bringing up  the race card, too. <br/>And dropping the "N" word. At the end of the day, Phillip will be public enemy number one. I just have to figure out who to make public enemy number two. <br/>I'd still rather die than keep him around, though. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: First things first, Andrea. I know you don't want to give it up. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you must build a multistage puzzle wheel. Here's how it works-- on my go all nine of you will race to  release a puzzle base and then solve a puzzle. The first six to finish move on to the final round where you  must solve a second puzzle to complete the wheel. First person to get it right, wins immunity, is safe in this  game. Losers, you know the drill. Tribal council, somebody voted out and sent to Redemption Island. We'll draw for spots and we'll get started. All right, here we go. First six move on to the next round. Survivors ready? Go! First round going to get you very dizzy. Ashley moving quickly. Phillip very slow. Rob flying around his. Steve moving quickly. Grant moving very fast. Ralph very slow. Andrea now in the lead. You need to pick it up, if you want to win! Andrea working. Grant working on his. Julie, Rob working. Ralph a little dizzy. <br/>Aahh! <br/>Jeff: Natalie and Phillip working. This puzzle's going to go quickly. When you have it step back and yell! <br/>Got it. <br/>Jeff: Rob moving on. Six people are moving on. We're looking for five more. <br/>Got it! <br/>Jeff: Julie has it. <br/>Got it! <br/>Jeff: Ralph has it! <br/>Phillip has it. <br/>God, I suck. <br/>Not quite. Nope. Sorry, baby. <br/>Jeff: Andrea has it! That's four. We're looking for two more. Steve is moving on! One spot left. Who's it going to go to? Grant, Natalie, Ashley, or Phillip? <br/>Why won't you go in there? You went in there before. <br/>Jeff: Grant racing to get his done. Grant moves on. Steve, Rob, Julie, Andrea, Ralph, and Grant move on to the next  round. All right, here we go for the final round. Survivors ready? Go! The first person to fit all their pieces wins immunity. You will not have to force these pieces. They will fit easily. Steve getting a fast move on it. Andrea doing a nice job. <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? <br/>Jeff: Rob starting to get a little something going. Andrea now in the lead. Rob right there with her. Grant making a lote of progress. Steve very close now. Rob down to his last couple of pieces. Andrea closer now. Down to her last couple of pieces. <br/>No! <br/>Jeff: whoa, whoa, easy, brother, easy. <br/>Get in there. Steve very close. Rob steps away. Thinks he has it. <br/>Steve's done. <br/>Jeff: Rob has it. Rob wins immunity! <br/>Way to go, Rob. <br/>Way to go, baby! <br/>Robbie. <br/>Jeff: Rob, come on over. [ applause ] nice work. Finished first in each round. Immunity is yours. Rob is safe at tonight's tribal council. [ applause ]  Ya! <br/>Jeff: Guaranteed at least one more day in this game. Everybody else, after 27 days, one of you will be voted out and  sent to Redemption Island. You have the afternoon to figure out who it's going to be. I will see you at tribal. <br/>The challenge was a close one for me. But I dropped the ball. There's three of us right now left in Zapatera. Our target is phil. If two of them would change their mind and vote for phil, bam. It's the only shot we got. <br/>I don't know. <br/>Damn, that's good. <br/>I have never eaten so much rice in my life. Tonight's going to be an easy vote. There are just three of us. Old Zapatera, and there are six of them. So the three old Zapatera are voting for Phillip. Really, we only need two more votes, or one of us old Zapatera  are leaving. The Ometepe tribe have enough numbers now where they can get rid  of somebody, so tonight would be a great night to get rid of Phillip. Phillip's right-- it's war. Phillip is going to have to hang out in his cute little  underwear from now on. I don't think he'll ever find those. <br/>My swim trunks were on the line. Did any of you girls move them? <br/>No. <br/>Did any of you guys move my swim trunks? <br/>I didn't see them. <br/>Okay, they must have got legs and walked away all on their  own. That's okay. It's all right. It can get real fun and exciting around here. <br/>Everybody in camp is over Phillip. <br/>The bottom line is I know my trunks were taken. And I want you to know, I can play that game. I can play that game. <br/>Phillip says all the time that, you know, he was a special  agent and he knows how to read people. <br/>You're from the big house, right? You from the big house? <br/>Crazy Phillip who wears feathers and pink underwear. Honestly, I can't wait to get rid of Phillip. <br/>I hope my shorts come up tonight because if they don't  come up tonight, it's going to get real interesting around here. <br/>I'm feeling threatened. <br/>I'm feeling threatened too. <br/>You shouldn't feel threatened by me. Because I don't really threaten people. I just go off like that. I just go off like that. <br/>That's kind of scary. <br/>It should be. You keep telling me I'm crazy. You keep telling me I'm crazy. <br/>This ain't the nfl. In the nfl, they got rules. They got referees. <br/>Check him out. <br/>Phil made a total ass out of himself, getting racial about  rice and crazy stuff, and I would really think with any kind of dignity, he'd  apologize for your asinine behavior but he hasn't said a word. The Ometepe tribe don't understand him, either. Maybe somebody might sway the vote and vote our way. <br/>Tonight, it doesn't Matter who we target, really. You got Ralph, you got Steve, and Julie. But, I don't know. I love Phillip, but, I mean, I don't know where his head is. There is room to play, but I don't know where. One man should not have this much power on an island, but I'm  grateful that I do. <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the first member of our jury, David. Phillip, based on what you're wearing, I'm guessing you had  another meditation. <br/>I actually had a former zap. Think it was cute and steal my clothes. Thought it was real funny. <br/>Jeff: Did you look at Steve? <br/>Yeah, I looked at Steve because I could tell that he was  the one who removed my clothes. <br/>Jeff: And you could tell-- this goes back to your former  training? <br/>Absolutely. I confronted Steve about the fact that they were deliberately  consuming all the rice. So it's been war between the two tribes. <br/>Jeff: So, Steve, Phillip is asserting that the the former Zapatera  are eating a lot more rice than anybody else, true? <br/>Well as the mouths started disappearing from the Zapatera  tribe, we didn't have to ration as much so we're eating our food the way we  choose to. <br/>Jeff: Andrea, the Zapatera tribe is making the argument  that it's none of your business how much rice we eat. <br/>It is a little frustrating because we will look out and  they will have this bowl full of rice for three of them. It just sucks because we have maggots in the bottom of our  container. <br/>Phillip was bringing this into a whole racial black and  white thing about the rice. <br/>Jeff: what was that about? <br/>I was relaxed and you went into a racial tirade and  bringing the "N" word up about yourself. <br/>Jeff: whoa. What happened? <br/>Jeff, it got ugly. He started threatening Steve. <br/>Jeff: how so? <br/>He started threatening me with tae kwon do or jujitsu or  something. He goes, "When I snap, I snap."  So he goes you're crazy and then the "N" word  came out. <br/>Jeff: who brought up the "N" word? <br/>Phillip brought up the "N" word. <br/>I'm going to interrupt here. Steve likes to call me crazy whenever I bring a rational  argument, this rice is spoiling, we can put it all in the same can. We can't do it. Why not? You're crazy, you're crazy, you're crazy. He resorts to calling me crazy because he doesn't want to say  the "N" word. He says crazy, crazy, crazy. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, you're saying when Steve calls you crazy  he's saying the "N" word. <br/>You know, richard pryor made a most famous comedy album of  all time. You know what the name of it is? "That 'n' is crazy." because we know that sometimes  when we confront certain types of individuals, that's one way that they try  to represent that. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, I'm trying to figure out where you're  making that leap, the crazy equals the "N" word because it's very  tricky when you have a white guy and a black guy talking about race and the  "N" word because it has such an ugly history to it. <br/>You know, do you know what it's like to be a woman? <br/>Jeff: I don't. <br/>Right, you don't. You don't know what it's like to be an african american. <br/>Jeff: Okay, Phillip--  Let me finish. You asked me a question. I'm going to go there. When I worked for the government as a federal agent in the  department that worked in I was the only one of 67. I can't sum it up for you in words, but I know it when I see it. Just like a woman knows it when a guy makes an inappropriate  remark. She can't put it into words but she knows she doesn't like it  and I've seen it many times in my life, and that's what he does. <br/>Jeff: let me use your same logic on you. You're saying I'm not black so I don't know. How do you know what he means when he says "Crazy?"  that's what I'm trying to get at. There's a jump in logic that I need the gap filled. <br/>When my father and I moved to upstate new york he and I  went to the grocery store together and the man behind the counter said to me  father, "What can I do for you, boy?" "You talking to  me?" "Yeah, I'm talking to you. What can I do for you, boy?" he didn't use the  "N" word but he took my father down to a very low level. <br/>I just want to say--  You can say what you want when I'm finished. <br/>I played 13 years in the nfl, the last seven years with  the los angeles raiders where one fifth of the team was white. There is no line of black and white in my heart. <br/>Jeff: I'm starting to get some clarity. If Steve said, "I don't know. That's a crazy argument. It doesn't really make any sense to me." you would say,  "That's a guy saying he doesn't like my thought process." but when  somebody says, "You're crazy" it's almost bringing up every ugly  association you can think of in one word. So tell me if this is right so far. There's been a big debate brewing about living together. It culminated with the rice, and you threw an idea out that you  felt was reasonable. Steve said, "I don't know. Let's figure it out. Let's talk about it." and then as the argument about the  rice continued, Steve made a comment that said, "I don't like it. You're crazy." at that point you equated that with you're  calling me the "N" word and now we have a whole new world we're  dealing with. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: Okay, now I'm caught up. Two people from different worlds had an argument. You took it one way. Nobody can question the way you took it and it's based on your  experiences and those of people before you. Nobody knows Steve's intentions, other than Steve right now,  because nobody here really knows Steve. We don't have any background on Steve. It's quite possible both of you are telling the truth. That that felt very much like the "N" word and he  absolutely didn't mean it that way. Is that a fair assessment? <br/>Sure. <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: So, Rob, how do you go forward at tribal council  when all of this is in the context of a million-dollar prize? <br/>Not easy. <br/>Jeff: You're going to vote somebody out tonight. Is this going to factor in? I'm guessing maybe on some level, conscious or subconscious. <br/>I mean, Phillip is a grown man. He says and feels what he wants. Steve is a grown man. He says and feels what he wants. I mean, it's pRoblematic, but it's real. You have people that have disagreements about things, but at the  same time, I can't imagine this not factoring into our decision. <br/>Jeff: Natalie, how does it impact the game? <br/>It's really hard for me to sit here and just listen  because I feel for Steve because I don't think that he has any prejudice in  him. And then I feel for Phillip, because I don't know what it's like  to be an african american man. <br/>Jeff: Okay. Last question. Shorts-- where are they? Who took them? Who has them? <br/>I took the shorts! <br/>Jeff: Thank you. <br/>Nobody will ever find them. I dug a hole and buried them and a rock on top of them. <br/>Jeff: If this were therapy I would say very good session. We'll come back wednesday and do it again. Julie, if you're a Zapatera member you're hoping for a crack in  the Ometepe. Maybe you just found it. <br/>Yeah, hopefully they're seeing that we would be a happy  family if there just wasn't this one division. <br/>Jeff: Steve, clearly, you're uncomfortable being labeled  as a racist. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: But in a game for a million dollars would you be  fine if as a result of this argument you were a part of, Phillip gets voted  out? <br/>I would be happy but not concerning any black and white  issue. We have three votes going that way, and hoping one or two others  might be getting tired of him as we are. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, if you are voted out tonight at this  moment, do you believe it would be based on anything racial? <br/>If for some reason tonight they felt like oh, we need to  let Phillip go at this point in time, then that's the tribe has spoken. <br/>Jeff: well, this has definitely been a fascinating tribal  council because it illustrates how you live together in a society and get  along in a game in which you then have to vote people out, send them to a  jury, and get them to vote for you for the million dollars. You are all in this together from this point forward. It is time to vote. Cannot vote for Rob. He has the necklace. Everybody else is fair game. Steve, you're up. <br/>I hope you find peace in your heart some day, brother. There's no prejudice involved with the crazy comment. <br/>It's got nothing to do with the color of your skin, phil. You are one crazy dude. <br/>Phillip, I hope you have a great night on Redemption  Island with the underwear and your two feathers. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Phillip. Phillip. Two votes Phillip. Phillip. Three votes Phillip. Julie. One vote Julie. Julie. That's two votes Julie. Julie. We're tied, three votes Phillip, three votes Julie. Julie. That's four votes Julie. Three votes Phillip. 11th person voted out of "Survivor: Redemption Island,"  Julie, that's enough. <br/>I guess you're never going to find your shorts. <br/>Jeff: You need to bring me your torch. Julie, the tribe has spoken. Grab your torch. Head to Redemption Island, good luck. Well, tonight's tribal council is indicative of how this game is  going to go from this point forward. Everything you say, everything you do may have a direct impact  on whether or not you get a shot at winning the million dollars. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on survivor. <br/>I'm truly blessed. <br/>Jeff: Phillip has his greatest day yet. <br/>It's all about getting rid of the right person at the  right time. <br/>Jeff: while Andrea could be scheduled for an early  departure. <br/>I'm just so over this game, man. <br/>Jeff: And Matt plumbs to the darkest depths of his soul. <br/>I'm out here wasting away. God has literally been carrying me. <br/>Here I am at redemption. I was not expecting this. I really thought it was going to be Steve or Ralph. But I'm okay with it. It just was an ugly tribal. There's poison in that tribe, and his name is Phillip. And it's kind of nice to be removed from it. Aarrgghhh! Did I scare you guys?
