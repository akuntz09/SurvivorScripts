<br/>JEFF Probst: In a totally unpredictable season... only one thing was certain. <br/>He's threatening Russell Hantz. When you do that, you go. <br/>Probst: Anyone who targeted Russell...  Watch your back, man. <br/>Same thing for you, man. <br/>Probst: ...found themselves blindsided instead. Tyson, Boston Rob, Coach, Courtney. The tribe has spoken. He achieved his goals with lies and deception. <br/>This is where I stand. Hook, line, and sinker. <br/>Probst: The only person to cross Russell and still survive...  Yeah, I trust you. <br/>Probst: ...was Sandra. <br/>But whatever Russell says, he's lying. <br/>Probst: Behind his back, she convinced the Heroes to join forces with her and  take him out. <br/>You want Russell gone? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Russell's gone. <br/>Probst: But Candice saw an opportunity to further her own game and joined up  with Russell, warning him he was in trouble. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Probst: With her plans betrayed, Sandra was forced to rejoin the Villains. <br/>You're saying you're going to vote for me? <br/>No, nobody's going to vote for you. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, a frightened Russell played the hidden immunity  idol. <br/>Russell's super-paranoid, and that is going to be his downfall. <br/>Probst: Russell wasted his idol because both Candice and Sandra voted with  the Villains... Amanda, the tribe has spoken. ...leaving the Heroes in their toughest position so far. What they don't know is that tonight, there will be two immunity challenges,  two Tribal Councils, and two more survivors will meet their fate. <br/>Tribal Council is interesting. Candice-- she helped us out, in that one vote, gets some numbers, and now  she's a threat. Someone who flips over that quickly to our side will just as easily flip-flop  back, so we don't really need her anymore. <br/>Candice was a pitiful player, and she just proved it to me tonight. She deserved to be on the Villains' tribe. Colby and I are standing out on a sinking ship now. There are no other Heroes. (bird squawking) (squeaking)  It's going to be fun from now on. <br/>Nah. Just-Just Rupert and Colby's not talking to me. <br/>Oh. Oh...  Their feelings are hurt. I mean, what game do they think they're playing? You know what I mean? <br/>I think Russell is a deceitful person, and anything he says is a lie. He could be worse than Jonny Fairplay. He is. With all that building up inside of me, I have to say something this morning  to Russell. My only hope is to show the Villains that disgusting side and ask them, truly,  do they want to be involved in that? I'll tell you what, man. You've already proven yourself to be a disgusting, terrible human being to  swear on your kids' life. <br/>Well, you know what, Rupe? It is the game, and you really ... for yourself. <br/>If you want to swear on your kids' life and call it the game, that's fine. I've played the game twice. People see, I'm not that liar. <br/>Do you think I care about how I ... look to you as a man? <br/>I think you don't give a damn about anything but yourself. <br/>I don't give a ... about you or your family. <br/>I know. I don't think you give a damn about anybody but yourself, and your team  should know that. <br/>Rupert, I'm a villain. I'm here so I just can make your life hell. The great powerful Rupert, the good guy. <br/>You know, you can say...  The second coming of Christ-- Rupert. <br/>You can say whatever you want, because it doesn't really matter anymore. (Russell laughs)  You're such a dumb ass, Rupert. I don't want Rupert here because Rupert's sitting there, trying to stir up  stuff, trying to make me mad. I'm just telling him, "Pack your stuff, partner. Pack your stuff. Get your tie-dye ready 'cause you're going home."  Probst: Come on in, guys! Guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Today, you are not playing for reward. You're playing for immunity. One of you going home tonight at Tribal Council. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: First things first, Jerri. You know I got to take it back. <br/>It was fun while it lasted. <br/>Probst: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will be standing barefoot on a small wooden perch  with your arm raised about your head. Your hand will be tethered to a bucket. When your hand drops, the bucket tips, you're out of the challenge. Last person left standing wins immunity. To make it interesting, I will tempt you by offering you food items. One other thing-- a twist which will be revealed at the end of this challenge. Take your positions. We'll get started. All right, this challenge is underway. Rupert competed in a variation of this challenge. Lasted a couple of hours. Parvati won this challenge in Fans vs. Favorites, lasting over six hours. But there's one difference-- the perch you're on today is a new addition. It makes it a little tougher. All right, are you guys ready to be tempted? <br/>I want it, Jeff. <br/>Probst: You want out? You don't even know what it is. <br/>I don't care. Whatever it is, I want it. <br/>I want it, too, Jeff. <br/>Probst: So, wait. Sandra and Russell, you both want it without seeing? <br/>Yup. <br/>Yeah, I don't care what it is. <br/>Probst: Step down then. <br/>For real? <br/>Probst: Step down. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Sandra and Russell, one minute into a challenge on day 31, with  immunity on the line, voluntarily step out of the challenge for an unknown  item. <br/>I don't care. <br/>Probst: Here's what you're sharing. <br/>Yes! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>What is it? <br/>Probst: Cookies and milk. Oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh! Oh, these cookies are off the hook. You guys don't know what you're missing. <br/>Probst: Down to six, just like that. <br/>Uh-oh. He's back. <br/>Probst: Next item. <br/>Donuts! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Four donuts and an iced coffee. <br/>Damn! <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: I'll give you guys 30 seconds to think about this before I give them to  Sandra and Russell. <br/>What? (Sandra laughs and mumbles)  All right, I'll take it, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Colby wants it. Anybody else want in? Drop out, Donaldson. Rise to avoid the green. <br/>Oh. <br/>Ninja Turtle style. <br/>Probst: All yours, brother. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Probst: We are down to five people left in this challenge. (Jerri exhales loudly)  Probst: I have another item. Let's see if I can get somebody else to give up immunity. <br/>Oh. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>What is it? <br/>Peanut butter and jelly? <br/>Probst: Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, chips, a big bowl of candy. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: Two glass of milk. <br/>Oh. <br/>I think I'm gonna take this one. <br/>I want to take it. <br/>I'll take it. <br/>I'll wait. <br/>Probst: So Danielle, Candice and Jerri are all coming down to share this. Step off. <br/>Oh. <br/>Your pants just came off. <br/>I hate you bitches. (laughing)  Probst: Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, chips, big bowl of candy, two  glasses of milk. How is it, ladies? <br/>Best sandwich I ever had. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Probst: And just like that, we are down to two. Parvati on one end, Rupert on the other. Both fighting for immunity. We could be here a long time. <br/>Probst: Been out here over an hour. <br/>Ooh ...  There he goes. <br/>Damn it! <br/>Probst: Rupert drops out of the challenge. Parvati wins immunity. <br/>Oh. <br/>Girl, congratulations. <br/>Good job, Parvati. <br/>Good work, Rupert. <br/>Probst: What happened, Rupert? <br/>Slipped. (scoffs) I could have made it hours. So I go home tonight. Done. <br/>Probst: Parvati, congratulations. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Probst: This challenge likes you, and you like it. <br/>Yay, Parvati. <br/>I love this challenge. <br/>Probst: Parvati wins this challenge once again. Parvati is safe at tonight's Tribal Council, guaranteed a one-in-seven shot  at winning this game for the second time. All right, guys, now to the twist I mentioned at the start of this challenge. This is a clue to a hidden immunity idol at your camp. "All hope is not lost if you suffer defeat. Salvation is hidden where two paths meet. A burning bush throws a shadow on top of a stone under which lies the key to  not going home." Have a fun afternoon. I will see you tonight at Tribal Council. <br/>At the challenge, Jeff read a clue to the immunity idol. So the minute we get to camp, all of a sudden, people just started running. <br/>We're gonna have to split up. Y'all go on that one. <br/>Parvati! <br/>The clue said, there'll be a burning bush, and in the shadow there'll be the  immunity idol. Is this a burning bush? <br/>It's red, isn't it? <br/>I thought it meant, like, a bush that's on fire. <br/>There's no bush on fire. <br/>What the hell's a burning bush? <br/>What is this thing? <br/>A dead tree. <br/>It's just a dead tree. <br/>Candice and Russell start digging where there's this big red bush. But across from there, there's another big red bush, so I start digging...  and I see it. Let me see what it says. I can't believe I finally found something. Um... I'm nervous-- I can't read this out here. I don't know where to put this. It's too big. Oh, no, it's too bulgy. <br/>You think it's on these trails? <br/>Well, I mean, these aren't really trails, right? <br/>Even though I don't have the idol, maybe I can play like I do. I stuck me a rock in my pocket, making it look a little dangly, a little big. This isn't my first game of Survivor. I'm just trying to stay in it another day. <br/>What's happening, Rupe? Feel like we're Easter egg huntin'. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I have a lot of experience with idols. Rupert has a big, bulky thing in his pocket. It's the idol wrapped up in the paper. Now, we have to get rid of the idol, so how are we going to do this? It's easy-- we'll split the votes tonight. If he don't play it, he goes home. That's how we'll do it. <br/>I don't know, I think everybody pretty much gave up. <br/>He found it. I see it in his pocket. I know exactly how they look. And I know exactly how they look in a pocket. <br/>Russell swears that Rupert found the idol. Of course, I know that's a lie, 'cause I have the freakin' immunity idol. And if they think Rupert has it, that's good for Sandra. So I'm not going to say nothing. <br/>No, we'll split the votes, three-three. <br/>Why? <br/>To get the idol out of Rupert's hands. <br/>We have to flush it out. <br/>Oh, right. <br/>So we have to split the votes. <br/>(whispers): It's perfect. <br/>Colby and Candice are both threats in different ways. That's why it's a hard decision. Candice voted with us to vote out Amanda, and I really think she's going to  stay loyal to us. Colby's not really doing any kind of strategizing, so I feel like I can get  him to do whatever. I don't know, I mean, either way, we're rolling the dice. <br/>Right now we need to be safe and make sure that idol is out of Rupert's hands. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Here's how it's gonna work. They're going to split the votes tonight, 'cause they got six of them, right? So they're going to send half of them your way, and the other half are either  going to go towards me or towards Candice. <br/>If three of them vote for Candice, then you and I vote for Candice, there's  five votes for Candice. <br/>And even if three of them vote for you and you don't have the idol, you're  still safe. <br/>There's still five votes for Candice. <br/>Exactly. I could be going home tonight if it doesn't work, but if it does, me and you  get to vote Candice out. <br/>Oh, God! That would be...  And then we've still got a shot. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Coach... Courtney... J.T., and Amanda, voted out at the last Tribal Council. All right, Rupert, let's pick up with the last Tribal Council. Amanda's voted out. You all go back to camp. What's the fallout? <br/>The fallout was, we realized there's only two Heroes left. There's Colby and I. Candice jumped to the Villains' side. <br/>Probst: Candice, you're shaking your head. Is that not true? <br/>It was obvious that Amanda was going to go home whether I voted for her or  not. You know, Amanda had a target on her back because she's a strong, strategic  player. So it wasn't like my vote was the nail in the coffin to send her home. The numbers were already there. <br/>I have no respect for the excuses. <br/>It's not going to get me any further in the game to go down on a sinking ship. <br/>Well, then that's what you should have said, that right there. <br/>Exactly right. <br/>"This is a game for a million dollars. This was my best play."  Probst: So, Russell, as a strategy, Candice put herself ahead of Colby and  Rupert, and that will keep her in the game longer. Good move. <br/>Yeah, it's her best move. She goes to the Villains' side at number six, and unless you're going to give  all the Villains a million dollars, something has to break within the  Villains-- so she could have made a great move. <br/>Probst: So if history repeats, now we're looking at Rupert or Colby in  trouble tonight. <br/>What am I supposed to say? I'm going to get rid of my Villain partners out here? No, that ain't gonna happen. We got two Heroes that's gonna have to go sooner or later, and the consensus  is that Rupert goes, so...  Probst: Rupert, after the challenge was over, I read a clue where another  idol was hidden. You get back to camp-- what happens? <br/>We got home from our challenge. I calmly took my sandals off and went for a walk in the jungle and stayed  until I felt comfortable. <br/>Probst: So, Russell, you think that idol's out there, or do you think Colby  or Rupert has the idol? <br/>If they don't, then they gave up. And I don't think Colby or Rupert would give up. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. Parvati has the immunity necklace. Cannot vote for Parvati. Everybody else is fair game. Colby, you're up. <br/>I can honestly say I'm proud of the way I played this game. Can you? <br/>My mom always told me, if you don't have something nice to say, don't say  anything at all. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote...  Probst: Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Rupert. Rupert. That's two votes Rupert. Rupert. That's three votes Rupert. Candice. One vote Candice. Candice. That's three votes Rupert, two votes Candice. Candice. We're tied, three votes Rupert, three votes Candice. That's four votes Candice, three votes Rupert, one vote left. 13th person voted out and the fifth member of our jury... Candice. You need to bring me your torch. Candice, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Thank you. Good luck, you guys. <br/>Probst: Time for you to go. Well, maybe the lesson learned from tonight's Tribal Council is this-- it's a  risky move when you betray trust in order to gain trust. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>I definitely got thrown under the bus tonight, um, but I understand I made a  risky move yesterday, and, um, it didn't pay off. So I guess... karma's a bitch sometimes. <br/>Wow. <br/>We just blew it. We were supposed to split the votes for Rupert and Colby, and it didn't  happen. It was a terrible decision. The girls got their heart involved in the game, wanted Candice out of here  because they didn't like her, so everybody blew it. And I'm one of them. I should have sat them down and said, "No, this is what we're gonna  do." From the get-go. ...one at a... Just Rupert alone. <br/>I'm not fully in control of this game now. Me and Parvati are equally in control, and that makes me a little worried. But you know what? I'm going to take control of this game so fast, they ain't even know what hit  them. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: First things first. Parvati, it looks like you're ready to give it up. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will each race to get a peg that you will use to  maneuver through a table maze. The first five to finish move on to the next round, where you will use four  individually-shaped pegs to help you get to the top of a tall climbing wall. The first three to get to the top of the wall move on to the final round,  where you must solve a slide puzzle. The first person to finish the puzzle wins immunity and is guaranteed a  one-in-six shot at winning this game and the million-dollar check. Losers, Tribal Council, where after 33 days, somebody will be sent home. We'll draw for spots, we'll get started. Here we go. First round. Survivors ready? Go! You've got to dig up your peg and then get it through the table maze. Rupert has his, and he's off to a fast start. Parvati, Sandra, Danielle have theirs. Russell's got his. Jerri has her peg. Everybody on the maze but Colby. Colby now has his peg and a lot of time to make up. Rupert was out very quickly. Russell now doing a good job on the maze. Rupert very close. Sandra getting close. Rupert's through. Rupert moving on. Sandra moving on. <br/>I can't believe it. <br/>Probst: Russell's moving on. Parvati moving on. One spot left. Three people vying for it. Jerri, Danielle and Colby. Danielle very close. Danielle moving on. Moving on to the next round. It's Rupert, Sandra, Parvati, Danielle and Russell. First three to the top of the wall move on. Survivors ready? Go! You have four pegs. Use them as you want. You don't have to use any of them. Russell gets himself halfway up the wall by just running. Rupert trying to run up the wall. You're going to have to run harder than that. Meanwhile, Parvati is moving up the wall. Danielle making steady progress. Russell climbing up this wall. Using only two pegs so far. Russell very close to the top. Russell to the top. Russell's moving on. Two more spots. Rupert making up for lost time. Parvati very close. Rupert to the top. He moves on. Parvati to the top. She moves on. It is Russell, Parvati and Rupert in the final round for immunity. <br/>Damn! <br/>Now how do I get down? <br/>Probst: All right, here we go. The final round. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! It's a slide puzzle. That means you can't pick up the pieces. You have to slide them around, building that very familiar Survivor logo. Don't slow down. Don't lose your concentration. Focus on finishing this puzzle. Russell starting to get it together a little bit. <br/>Probst: Rupert's now starting to come together with his puzzle. Parvati falling out of it. Russell much closer now. Rupert very close. We are neck and neck. <br/>Jeff. <br/>Probst: Russell thinks he has it. Russell wins immunity! <br/>Way to go, Russell! <br/>Good job, Russell! <br/>Probst: Russell, come on over. <br/>Good job, Russell. <br/>Probst: Russell safe tonight at Tribal Council. For the rest of you, after 33 hard-fought days, somebody going home tonight. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I'll see you at Tribal. Congrats. <br/>I was thinking as I walked out of that darn challenge, "You made it so  far, and still came up short." I have to believe in myself, because just  the lie of a rock in your pocket is not going to save you tonight. (thunder crackling)  I want Rupert to go home tonight. He's a Hero. He is not part of our original tribe of Villains. And I'm pretty sure Rupert does not have the idol. So, yeah, I don't feel bad for Rupert at all. I think he's kind of dug his own grave. The Villain invasion happened, and now the Villains are running this place. There ain't gonna be any Heroes left. No Heroes. Seriously. <br/>What do you mean locked in...? <br/>I mean, we need to be strong, five, and get those two off, because if those...  one of those guys makes it to the end, none of us stand a chance. It has to be five Villains...  Yeah, I know that. <br/>...and that's it. <br/>I know that. <br/>And honestly, right now, we're set up pretty good, because Rupert can go  home, Colby's not good in challenges, and he can go home next, you know? <br/>Parvati and Danielle, to me, they're a team, when it's supposed to be me and  Parvati. And that's a problem. So the only thing I can think of right now is to break up that couple. <br/>You really think so? <br/>Mm. I wouldn't take her to the finals. <br/>Oh. <br/>She might try to get rid of you or try to get rid of me. Uh, that's going to come. If she tries to get rid of either of us, you know, we can easily bounce out  her. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Russell brought up that he wants to get rid of Parvati, but I don't know if  we should do that. You know, Parvati's been my alliance since the beginning, and, like, if we  are going to ever do that-- which I don't know if I am because I'm in a tight  alliance with her-- but if we are, now is not the time. I trust you, like, 110%. I don't have any worries about you. <br/>Yeah, I trust you, too. <br/>Danielle came to me. She wants to vote you off when it comes down to five or six. <br/>Why would she want to do that? <br/>And I ain't messing with you, Parvati. You got to... As... like I told you, my loyalty lies with you in this game,  and that's it. I'm working Danielle. I'm working Parvati. I'm telling Parvati we've got to get rid of Danielle. I'm telling Danielle we got to get rid of Parvati. So, by working both of them, I got both of them under control. Parvati's not going to tell Danielle, Danielle's not going to tell Parvati,  'cause it'd mess up both of their games. <br/>Well, I want to talk to her. <br/>Are you serious? <br/>Yes, I'm serious. <br/>About what? <br/>You can't just come at me and tell me that my final three from day one wants  me out. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>And you think I'm not going to talk to her? <br/>You gonna talk to her? <br/>I'm not going to tell her you told me that, but...  She's going to know...  ...I'm gonna find out what she's saying. <br/>Parvati, if you do that, you're out of this game. I promise you. Are you serious? You're going to go tell her exactly what I'm trying to keep a secret from her? <br/>I just told you, I'm not going to say what you're saying. <br/>You can't even bring it up. Go ahead. Do what you think you need to do, Parvati. <br/>Don't yell at me, Russell. <br/>I can't believe you're, you're thinking like this. <br/>Thinking like what? Like I want to have a ... conversation with someone? <br/>You can't go up to her and say anything...  Don't tell me I can't have a conversation with someone. <br/>Okay, all right. You go talk to her. You do that. <br/>Today should have been Rupert: done. Russell comes out of nowhere and says, "They're blind-siding "you. That's what's happening." I'm, like, "I'm not voting "Danielle  tonight. "I don't care what you say. I'm not doing it."  It could be dangerous if Parvati would talk to Danielle about what I told her  that Danielle wants to get rid of Parvati. It could turn into a problem. <br/>Sh wanted to blind-side you! <br/>He said that to you? <br/>Yes. <br/>He told me that you came up to him and said that you wanted to blind-side me  now because, um, you don't think you can win against me and, like, all this  other stuff. <br/>He's such a liar. <br/>But I'm not voting you tonight. I won't. I refuse. <br/>So Russell's trying to vote me out tonight? <br/>We have to get out Rupert or Colby. <br/>I know. He's got this whole thing, like, he wants me and you to be, like, at each  other's throats...  I think he's worried that if it's at the final three and it's you, me, and  him...  He's gonna...  ...you and I will take each other, and he'll be out. <br/>I'm-a get Danielle off tonight because it eliminates that pair. As soon as we get rid of Danielle, Parvati is going to be so scared of me,  she's gonna stick to me like glue. And she's gonna vote the way I tell her to vote. There's only one thing that has to happen today, and that's Danielle go home. <br/>Really? Really? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's funny how things change in this game. <br/>I know, I know, damn it. <br/>How did this get flipped on me? <br/>It's crazy. <br/>Why? Why do we want to keep Colby and Rupert around? That doesn't even make any sense. <br/>It doesn't make sense. It does not make sense. <br/>Russell running around double talking is hurting his game. He's getting outplayed by me and Danielle at this point, and it's making him  a little bit crazy. The only thing we have to do is make sure Jerri doesn't write your name down. <br/>I'm ripping my hair out. Do not change your vote tonight, no matter what he says to you. <br/>Oh, no, I won't. <br/>He's trying to vote me out. <br/>He's trying to vote her out tonight. <br/>It's Rupert. <br/>Insane-o. <br/>Are you crazy? It's Rupert. <br/>He's causing all this... craziness again. <br/>Please don't write my name down tonight. <br/>I want Danielle gone tonight. <br/>We need to get rid of Rupert. <br/>Bad move. You're going to be next. Not 'cause of me. <br/>Don't threaten me. <br/>Not 'cause of me. I'm trying to save you. You don't get rid of Danielle, you're gonna be after her. <br/>Why do you say that? <br/>It ain't me. It ain't me. I can't do nothin'. You have to help me help you. <br/>Who are you talking about? Explain to me why that's even...  I can't. I'm telling you now, we have to get rid of Danielle tonight, or they will get  rid of you. <br/>Probst: Now bring in the members of our jury. Coach... Courtney... J.T.... Amanda... and Candice, voted out at the last Tribal Council. Rupert, who's running this show right now? <br/>I don't know. It's probably between Parvati and Russell. <br/>Probst: Danielle, ring true to you-- Russell and Parvati pretty much guiding  the shots over here for the Villains? <br/>Um, I don't necessarily think that's true. I think the Villains make decisions together. <br/>Probst: Really? This close to a million dollars, you all agree? <br/>Yeah, we're still together, aren't we? <br/>Probst: That doesn't mean you agree. <br/>But we agree voting out the Heroes and sticking together. <br/>Probst: So, Jerri, around camp must be fairly peaceful, then. The Villains all agree on the decisions, and Rupert and Colby going,  "It's you or me, dude."  Hell, no. It's never been quiet since day one playing this game, and it is certainly  not quiet right now. <br/>Probst: So, Danielle, why this illusion that it's one big happy family? <br/>There was just a miscommunication, Jeff, honestly. There were things said, and, no, not everybody agreed today, at all. It was mad chaos. <br/>"Crazy" could not describe what happened today. <br/>Craziness, crazy, crazy. <br/>Like, unnecessarily out of control, like...  Danielle and I were pitted against each other. <br/>We were pitted against each other. <br/>Probst: Parvati, what happened? <br/>Well... Russell came to me and told me that Danielle was trying to blindside  me today. She said it was not true and went crazy. (laughs) And so Russell's trying to test loyalty. That's what I got from the whole thing. <br/>Probst: So, Russell, you got caught. <br/>No, I didn't get caught doing nothin'. Today, Danielle came up to me before I said anything and said, "When do  you...  Lies. Liar. Liar. <br/>"...when do you want to get rid of..." Let me finish talking. Danielle knows where my loyalty lies, and that's with Parvati. If you gonna come up to me...  And me, you've been telling me...  If you gonna come up to me, if you gonna come to me and try to get rid of  Parvati...  For the last...  ...then I'm gonna try to get rid of you. <br/>You just sat me on the beach and said that you don't want to go against  Parvati at the end because you think...  I wanted to see where you stood, and I exactly found out. <br/>Oh, really? <br/>The three of us are in an alliance, so I don't understand why. I haven't done anything to be disloyal to him. I don't understand why he's testing me. I don't know. (voice breaking): Oh, my God. (chuckles)  Probst: What are the tears about right now? <br/>(sobbing): I'm just a frigging wreck! I'm so exhausted, and I'm just like... It's just too much for me right now. Oh, man. I just had a rough day. We've been in an alliance since the beginning. I don't know why he's trying to mess with it. <br/>Probst: Is it feeling personal to you? Is that hurting your feelings? <br/>Yeah! <br/>I don't understand how she's just putting it all on me. Why I'm trying to mess with it when she agreed totally with that. <br/>Because you were telling me she wanted to get me off. What am I supposed to say? <br/>And when she said, "Let's get rid of..." Can I finish, please? <br/>No. <br/>Whatever. <br/>You're such a liar. It wouldn't have happened. It didn't. <br/>It would have happened if I would have wanted it to happen. <br/>It would not have happened. I'm closer to Parvati than you think. <br/>Oh, really? <br/>Yeah, really. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Boy, that perked you up. <br/>We're all fine right now. There's no need for us to continue with this conversation. It's been resolved. At least, it was resolved today. <br/>Probst: Well, it just got reopened when you said you're closer to Parvati  than Russell thinks. <br/>No, he is underestimating, like, my friendship and my loyalty to her, and I  don't like that, so I'm just letting him know that I would never do that to  her. Probst: All right, then let's get to the vote. Russell has the immunity necklace. You cannot vote for Russell. Everybody else is fair game. Danielle, you're up. <br/>Okay, second time's the charm, right? Hopefully, you're going home home tonight. <br/>(whispers): You're closer to Parvati than I think? That makes me think that y'all got something going on, so I'm gonna have to  cut that tie. <br/>I have absolutely no idea what just happened, but with this vote, I'm sealing  my fate. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. All right, once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Rupert. Rupert. Two votes Rupert. Rupert. Three votes Rupert. Danielle. Three votes Rupert, one vote Danielle. Danielle. That's three votes Rupert, two votes Danielle. Danielle. We're tied. Three votes Danielle, three votes Rupert. One vote left. 14th person voted out and the sixth member of our jury: Danielle. You need to bring me your torch. Danielle, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Bye. <br/>Probst: So here's what we learned tonight: the Villains are clearly not one  big, happy family. Colby and Rupert live to see another day, and it is anybody's game. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:  I'm against you, Russell. <br/>Probst: Russell is on the outs with the Villains. (Parvati giggles) So he tries to turn the Heroes to the dark side. <br/>Greatest Villain, the greatest Hero. I want to trust you all the way to the final three. <br/>Final three. Final three. <br/>Russell is insane. And tonight, I might have put my own foot in my mouth at Tribal Council by  basically just calling him out in front of everybody. And I think he changed his vote the last minute, actually. I feel like I played a good game and maybe a little too aggressive this time. But I did the best that I could and that's all you can ask.
