<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor... Elisabeth: Oh my gosh! <br/> Jeff: The tribes' spirits were lifted when a reward challenge brought them a message from home. <br/>Keith: Will you marry me please? <br/>Oh, my god. [ Tina laughs]  Keith: Yes! Yes! Yes. [ cheering]  Jeff: The constant rain and lack of food led to growing tensions between Colby and Keith. <br/> Colby: I'm not going to do this ration thing again when we run out of rice, Keith. <br/>Keith: Fine. <br/>Colby: We are eating fine. <br/> Keith: There's something going on here, and I'm really in a very vulnerable situation. <br/>Jeff: Go! Colby won his third immunity in a row. <br/>Colby: Sweet, baby! <br/> Jeff: And luckily for Keith, despite his self-proclaimed vulnerability, it was Rodger who was voted out at Tribal Council. Four are left. Who will be the next to go? [ birds singing] Who will be the next to go? [ birds singing]  Elisabeth: I'm the last of the Kucha tribe. I was lonely last night. It's different here without Rodger. He's a little treasure I happened to find in the Outback from Kentucky. Good rice. It was emotional for me to see Rodger be voted out, but he would never want me to, you know, get all mushy and sad and kind of lay down and die. Like, no way. I'm gonna... I want to win this thing. I did not think I'd be... this game would get me so emotionally sometimes. It all started when Rodger gave me his rock, started the emotional roller coaster. That was early, too. That was, like, day four or something. Today I spent a lot of time talking with Tina and just, you know, about family, about a lot. I think probably with Rodger gone, I miss family more. <br/> Tina: I miss my husband and my children more than anything. <br/>Elisabeth: I miss my family and Tim. <br/>Tina: Hmm. <br/>Elisabeth: Just comforts, all the things you love. I just miss them all. Sometimes I feel as if I'm not... here for my life. <br/> Colby: I think my mom probably misses me the most, just because of-of how close we are. I mean, I know she's the one I miss the most, and I know she's the one that has gotten me through all this. I mean, I talk to her on a daily basis when I get off and spend time by myself. Obviously, she doesn't respond orally, but I know she's hearing me. <br/> Tina: Whenever we very first started playing this game, we knew there were some luxuries that we could not afford ourself. One was thinking about family. But now that it's getting towards the end, it seems that, you know, we can joke around a little bit even, and we can laugh about it, and we can keep our sanity. <br/>Colby: I'm going to run to the grocery store. Do ya'll need anything? <br/>Tina: Oh, yeah, popcorn. <br/>Colby: Stop by the ATM machine and bring us some cash. <br/>Elisabeth: Yeah. <br/>Tina: Okay. <br/>Elisabeth: That'd be great. <br/>Tina: Put gas in the car for me. <br/>Colby: Will do. <br/> Elisabeth: Yeah, there's a lot of, kind of make yourself feel a little more normal. You know, Colby will run to the convenience store and pick up some gum. We go to check the mail. Checking the mail is probably one of the most normal things we do. <br/>Tina: Oh! All right, you lazy bones, we got mail! <br/> Elisabeth: "You know that in life, second chances are rare. And regrets for the past, you all have your share. Hope you've learned well all the skills of surviving, 'cause into the winners circle one person is driving." Maybe we're driving in the challenge. <br/>Tina: I think that's the reward maybe. <br/>Colby: I don't know. Sounds cool, though. <br/>Elisabeth: It does sound cool. âª  Jeff: Come on in. Well, it's not often that you get a chance to make up for past mistakes. Today you will. Today's challenge combines elements of previous challenges you've already done. So if you've learned anything, piece of cake. If you haven't, you'll be repeating history. You're going to start blindfolded and shackled. And you're going to take a carabiner, clip on to a rope's course, navigate your way through a series of obstacles. When you reach the end of the ropes course, you'll ring a bell. That'll let you know you can take off your blindfold. You'll then move on to the next phase which is a puzzle. When you complete the puzzle, you get a key. That undoes the shackle. You move on to the third phase. Filling a bucket with water, you'll move across a very narrow balancing beam to your fire and water scale. Dump the water into the water bucket. Continue this process until you fill it to a point where it starts spitting water out. When it does, move over to your fire bucket, which is held down by a taut rope, start your fire. When the fire burns through the rope, the bucket will rise. First person to make a fire that lights the fuse wins the reward. <br/>Colby: Hmm. Wow. <br/>Jeff: Now, this is our final reward challenge. And it's a doozy. The reward includes a tent, a mattress, four wheels, and a key. You're playing for a Pontiac Aztec. This is a car that converts into a tent. The back end opens up. It becomes a tent. You have a mattress inside. It's pretty cool. So, it will be waiting for you when you get back home. But I want you to break it in first. So tomorrow night, you'll convert your new Aztec into a tent. You'll have a good night's sleep here in the Outback. You'll also have the use of a hot shower, soap, shampoo...  Keith: Oh! <br/>Jeff: ...and a hot meal. Let's go do it. <br/>Colby: Unbelievable. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God. <br/>Tina: A car? <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my gosh. <br/>Tina: We are playing for a car? <br/>Elisabeth: And...  Jeff: All right, guys, this is our last reward challenge. You're the final four survivors. Survivors ready! Go! âª  Jeff: One carabiner on at all times. [ bell clangs] times. [ bell clangs]  Jeff: Take off your blindfold. Everybody's still doing well. Keep it up! [ bell tinkles] Take off your blindfold, Tina. You're doing fine, Elisabeth. Down to the home stretch. [ bell clanging] Do not lift anything. That's it. Remember, it's got to line up with the pattern underneath. That's it. Slow down and think. It's got to match the pattern underneath. That's it. That's it. <br/>Tina: Take my locks off? <br/>Jeff: Yes. <br/>Colby: That way, Elisabeth. [ Elisabeth panting]  Jeff: Everybody's still very much alive. All right, Colby. [ Colby groans] [ Tina groans] [ Keith panting]  Keith: Maybe... Oh! <br/>Jeff: You're close. You're tight. This might do it. You're good. Fire. <br/>Jeff: This will do it, Elisabeth. You're good. <br/>Keith: Geez. You're good. <br/>Keith: Geez. <br/>Jeff: You've still got to build a fire. <br/>Tina: Please be it. Jeff? <br/>Jeff: You're good. <br/>Keith: Go, Tina, go! <br/>Colby: Jeff, Jeff, Jeff. Yeah! Now we're talking! <br/>Tina: You got the car! <br/>Colby: I just won a new car. I cannot believe it. I never had a new car. I won a new damn car! <br/>Jeff: Way to go, Colby. Tomorrow night, you're camping out in your new car. <br/> Colby: Got one hell of a winning streak going, and I'm just going to ride it as long as I can. [ birds singing] I can. [ birds singing]  Elisabeth: This is the most challenging thing I've ever had to do. On a daily basis. It's not the games, it's not the reward challenge. Those are hard in themselves. Like, they'd be hard anywhere. Living here day-to-day-- those are the real challenges. My hair is falling out! My hair is falling out! My hair has been falling out in a lot of clumps. I don't know if I can get one right now, but it just keeps... Yeah, like, it falls out all the time. It's malnutrition. See, look at that? <br/>Colby: The old mail box. Look at that. A scale. <br/>Keith: What do you got there? <br/>Colby: A little vanity mirror for you, bubba. <br/>Keith: Ooh. Don't need to look at that again. <br/>Colby: Don't need to look at that. "Sure it may work, but it's best not to try it. The pounds melt away on the tough Survivordiet. Living in the Outback is not without cost. Just look in the mirror and see what you've lost."  Keith: I don't think this is a challenge. I think this is just a... just a...  Colby: You know, I think it's just pure entertainment. <br/>Keith: Yeah, exactly. <br/> Colby: We get to take the scale back and see how much we weigh. Hey, girls, y'all are gonna love this! <br/>Elisabeth: What, you got a scale? <br/>Colby: Yup. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, no, not a mirror. <br/>Keith: A scale and a mirror, kids. <br/>Tina: No, I can't do it. <br/>Colby: Come on, Tina, step on this baby. <br/> Keith: All right, the, uh... It's in kilograms and...  Colby: Set on zero. <br/>Keith: One kilo is 2.2 pounds. <br/>Tina: 45 times 2. I weighed 115 when I came out here. <br/>Elisabeth: 115? <br/>Keith: Oh, my God. <br/>Colby: You weigh 99 pounds, Tina. <br/>Tina: 99? What am I...? So I've lost 16. <br/>Keith: Wow. <br/>Elisabeth: I'm at 46? <br/>Colby: What did you weigh coming in? <br/>Elisabeth: Probably about 113. <br/>Colby: It's 101. <br/>Keith: What did I lose? <br/>Colby: Okay, Keith. <br/>Keith: 65. Oh, my god. <br/>Colby: What did you weigh coming in here? <br/>Keith: 170. <br/>Colby: Oh, my God. <br/>Elisabeth: And what do you weigh right now? <br/>Colby: 143. <br/>Keith: Whoa. <br/>Tina: Wait, what did you weigh before? <br/>Colby: 190. <br/>Elisabeth: And you weighed what? <br/>Colby: 25 pounds I've lost. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God. <br/>Colby: You've lost 27? <br/>Keith: 27 Pounds. <br/>Elisabeth: I've lost...  Keith: The 42-day rice diet. Thank you, Australia Outback. <br/>Colby: Oh...  Elisabeth: ...12... 12 pounds. Everyone was really shocked. There are 20 something pounds lost by Colby, almost 30 pounds lost by Keith. Tina is at 99. She's not even in triple digits. And I'm not too far away from that. I'm just feeling as though my stomach is eating itself. Combined. <br/>Tina: Combined, four people, we have lost 85 pounds. <br/>Elisabeth: We've lost a third grader. <br/>Tina: That's scary. You know, I just... I can't believe it. <br/>Elisabeth: Kind of blows your mind. <br/>Tina: Yeah, you know why you're losing all your hair. <br/>Elisabeth: Yeah. Now I know why my hair is falling out. [ animals chittering] [ birds singing]  Keith: See you guys in a little bit. <br/>Colby: All right. <br/>Tina: Bye. Have fun. <br/>Colby: Keith goes on little sabbatical walks. Keith and I haven't had a whole lot of conversation lately. I think Keith is trying to figure out exactly what his strategy is going to be in the next couple of days, and probably also doing a lot of thinking about tomorrow's challenge. I get the feeling that Keith feels like he needs to win tomorrow. [ birds singing]  Keith: If my legs hold out, I'm going to go to the top of this ridge. You can see 360 degrees over the whole plate land of the Outback here. It's a magnificent view, but it's a long walk. <br/>Colby: I'm so pumped. <br/>Elisabeth: You should be. This is unbelievable. Unbelievable. You've waited. You've been so patient. <br/>Colby: I have been patient. <br/>Elisabeth: And you are excited today. Yesterday, shocked, today, excited. <br/>Colby: Today, I'm pumped. <br/>Elisabeth: Yes. <br/> Colby: I'm just counting down the minutes, and hopefully going to, uh, get a look at my new ride, my new wheels, and a hot meal tonight. <br/>Tina: Colby, here's you some flowers. <br/>Colby: Oh, my gosh! Look at that. Thank y'all so much. <br/>Elisabeth: Enjoy it. <br/> Colby: The girls surprised me with a little car-warming gift, in lieu of a housewarming gift, like when you get a new house. A lot of people you deal with in this game are-are disingenuous. They're just... It's not real. But with those two girls, I really believe it is. I'm so excited. That is beautiful. [ women laughing]  Tina: Look to your right. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, here's Jeff. <br/>Colby: What's up, Jeff? <br/>Jeff: Wow. What's going on? <br/>Colby: How you doing? Good. <br/>Jeff: You ready to get out of Dodge? <br/>Colby: Yes, sir. I'm so excited. <br/> Jeff: Your chariot awaits, as does a really nice hot shower and a hot meal. And we got enough grub, I'm going to join you if that's cool. <br/>Colby: Oh, perfect. <br/>Tina: Wow. <br/>Jeff: Where's Keith? <br/>Colby: We don't know. He took off on a walk. <br/>Tina: Oh. We love you! <br/>Colby: I wish I could take y'all with me. <br/>Elisabeth: Well, we wish you could, too. <br/>Elisabeth: Hey, Colby, enjoy your time. <br/>Colby: Thank you so much. <br/>Elisabeth: You have a good night. <br/>Colby: Let's roll. <br/>Jeff: Well, wherever Keith is at, say-say hello. <br/>Tina: Okay. <br/>Jeff: All right. <br/>Tina: Have a great time. <br/>Elisabeth: Bye, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: See you guys. <br/>Colby: See y'all in the morning. <br/>Elisabeth: Bye, Colby. <br/>Tina: See you in the morning, Colby. [ Colby howls]  Elisabeth: Bye, Colby. Knowing that that was the last reward challenge, and I couldn't pull one out was kind of sad. When you come so close to something, you almost touch that car and have that warm meal, and then you don't get it. I want the prize at the end. That's it. Simple. And I was thinking a little bit about Rodger. I miss him. And I really want Keith to come back so we can eat. <br/> Keith: We all find ourselves doing more of a going off and being by yourself time, uh, and thinking. I think what I spent so much time thinking about is my family, my children, my parents, and of course, my fiancÃ  e. And I know that, I-I see the light at the end of the tunnel now. It's-It's real close now. You don't have a lot of control at this stage of the game. The cards have been dealt and fate is inevitable. So, it makes the most sense just to kind of glide in, be cool and calm, enjoy these last few days the best you can. âª  Colby: Which, by the way, I'm still in disbelief. <br/>Jeff: Yeah. <br/>Colby: A car. <br/>Jeff: I know, it is kind of... It's kind of...  Colby: You guys gave away a car for a reward! <br/>Jeff: Yeah. It is pretty cool. <br/>Colby: Sweet! It's yellow! Look at that thing! She looks good! How wild is this thing? God, look at the interior on this... Now, this is a trip. It's awesome. I mean, the car is way cooler than I thought it was going to be. And then here's the stereo and stuff under here. And it's got some of the neatest amenities a vehicle has ever had. You know, you got a stereo in the back of it, not to mention a huge tent. This is unbelievable! <br/>Jeff: Yeah. Dude, you got to be hungry. <br/>Colby: Too much. I'm starving. <br/>Jeff: Let's eat. <br/>Colby: Let's grub, definitely. What's going on here? <br/>Jeff: A little appetizer. Have another cracker. You want to chew on this for a while, or you want me to bring out the good food? <br/>Colby: Oh, yeah, bring it on. Let's see what we got. <br/>Jeff: All right. Bring out the food, please. Oh, here comes our food. Thanks. <br/>Colby: Oh, my God! [ laughter] What are you doing? Oh, my God. What are you doing? Oh. One thing you don't realize how much you miss until you... you're here is the touch and the intimacy of loved ones. Oh, my, gosh! <br/>Oh, Colby. <br/> Colby: Being able to hold somebody and hug them-- that's one of the significant, uh, importances of having my mom here, just because she brings some of my daily normalcy back to me. I got something for you. Two girls gave me, instead of a housewarming gift, a car-warming gift, and they went out and found me some wild flowers, and so we'll set that. <br/>Oh. How pretty. <br/> Colby: Their names are Tina and Elisabeth, and they're two incredible women. I can't believe you're here. [ Mom laughs] I don't even know...  I can't, either. <br/>Colby: I don't know even how to act. It doesn't feel like we're together. <br/>This is just totally weird. <br/>Colby: Mm. [ laughing]  Colby: First of all, you know what I've had to eat today? Four spoonfuls of rice. That's our meal. <br/>And that's all? <br/>Colby: That's our meal, Mother, twice a day. <br/> Seeing Colby after this length of time-- there's a look in his eyes that bothers me a lot, and I think it's... it's probably from hunger. And emotional isolation. <br/> Colby: After 38 days, I've been to the bathroom three times. <br/>Colby! <br/>Colby: Three times in 38 days. <br/>It breaks my heart when I look at him. I knew he would... that he was going to lose weight, but... as his mother, I wasn't really prepared to... to see how much weight he's lost. <br/> Colby: I mean, it's been so frustrating losing weight and being so weak all the time. I mean, you can't imagine how weak on a daily basis we are. We're just lethargic. It's just, the days are so long. Oh, now, we're talking! Oh. There you are. <br/>You asleep yet? <br/>Colby: I feel horrible. Seems like we've been here for six months. <br/>A lot of it's been tough emotionally, too. <br/> Colby: It's so hard to imagine that the four of us that are left have made it through all of this. I mean, we say our prayers every night at how fortunate we are to still be here, 'cause it's so easy to get kicked off. And you just got to keep your head in the game, 'cause it's so close now, and it's so important to play hard. That's all I've ever done from day one is play as hard as I can. Oh! This is by far the most refreshing shower I've ever had. This morning was awesome. Uh-oh. I think that's it for the old shower. Out of everything that took place in the last 24 hours, the hot shower I was looking forward to the least. However, now that it's done, I think I enjoyed it the most next to being able to visit with my mom. I had no idea having a hot shower would feel so good. <br/>Tina: That's a big dog. <br/>Elisabeth: I love how we always wait for Colby's stories. "Colby, tell us how it is in the lap of luxury." Oh, hang on, hang on. Keith, this thing broke off. <br/>Keith: Hold on. <br/>Elisabeth: We didn't lose a lot right? <br/>Colby: How's my family doing? Oh! Look what I brought. <br/>Tina: Welcome to Barramundi! <br/>Colby: I've missed you all. <br/> Tina: We see Colby coming up, and along with Colby is this person with a pink sweater on, and it was Colby's mom. <br/>Keith: I am the cook. <br/>Yes, I've heard. Mister cook. <br/> Tina: She gave us all a big hug and said, "This is a hug from home."  And I know what state he was in. And it just... it just breaks my heart. <br/> Elisabeth: Colby's mom was... she was like the token loved one from home. <br/>Lots of hugs. <br/> Elisabeth: I think we were all able to feel that love and feel that care that we've been missing for so long. I mean, when she hugged me... I felt my whole family there. <br/>Keith: It's an honor to have you here. <br/>Colby: Come look where we're living. <br/>I am honored to be here. <br/>Colby: And this is the leanto that we sleep in. <br/>Home sweet home. <br/>Colby: Yes, it is, home sweet home. So is it what you thought we'd be living in? <br/>No, it's a little cruder than what I thought actually. <br/>Colby: Four more days of this. <br/>Tina: You want to sit down? We've got chairs for everybody. <br/>Colby: Yeah, here, Mom. <br/> Grandma is going to sit up here, I might not get up again if I sit on the ground. <br/>Colby: Keith, the Yanks won the World Series. <br/>Keith: Oh, really? Wow. <br/>Tina: You give us so much information. Can you tell us things like, the president and what's going on? Tell me what's happened. <br/>Oh, my goodness. <br/> Elisabeth: To hear stuff that's going on at home, it makes you feel as if the world doesn't really stop without you. It keeps going. Our home's at home are... News is happening. Life goes on. <br/> Colby: Right in the middle of conversation Mom gets up, kind of takes off for a sec and comes back like Santa Claus with a big burlap sack over her arm, and kind of throws it on the rug in front of us and says, "I can't leave without giving you guys something to go on."  I think there might be some things in here you all would like. <br/>Tina: Oh, my gosh! <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, what is it? <br/> Colby: And she brought back care packages for Tina and Elisabeth and Keith from their families. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my mom! Thank you so much! <br/>Keith: Oh, man. Oh, my God. <br/>Tina: Gosh, she's beautiful! Oh, my gosh. Look at this. Look at my daughter's legs. <br/>Keith: I had a moment. I mean, me looking at pictures of my kids, and reading letters from my girlfriend, it hits... you know, it's hard not to hold back. We only have a few days left, but it's hard. <br/>Tina: You have done a marvelous job with this young man. If my daughter marries a man like Colby, I'll feel very fortunate. You did an incredible job. <br/>I really can't take all of the credit. I did help raise him, but you know, he came from a gene pool. <br/> Colby: It's almost like a conjugal visit if you were a prisoner, you know, having someone that can come see you, but you've got a piece of Plexiglas in between you and that person or something. It was, in a way, like that. It was bittersweet. I knew she was going to be here, but I also knew she was going to get taken away. <br/>Keith: I will be there, and I to get taken away. <br/> Keith: I will be there, and I will cook a dinner for you, I promise. <br/>Okay. <br/>Elisabeth: We'll take good care of Colby, okay? <br/>Colby: You get to ride in style, don't ya? <br/>I guess. <br/>Colby: Tell everyone I can't wait to get back. Warn 'em how skinny and hairy I am. I told you I was skinny and hairy. I love you. <br/>Be careful. <br/>Elisabeth: You all right? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it felt... it felt good. <br/>Elisabeth: What a lady. <br/>Tina: What a woman. <br/>Elisabeth: She really is, Colby. <br/> Colby: I'm so lucky to have happen what has happened over the last day and a half, but now it's time to shift gears. Now it's time to go play. We got to go do a challenge and then, inevitably, go to a Tribal Council night and get rid of one of those three people up there, if not myself. How weird is that? <br/>Colby: Oh, look what I got! A Texas flag bandanna. How cool is that? Still got my lone star pride going, man. <br/>Keith: You can wear that tonight. <br/>Colby: Yes, sir. That's way cool. <br/>Keith: Not a whole lot you can do right now. You go in and do the best you can on these immunities. If you come out holding the immunity then your position is set. If you don't come out holding your immunity, you better have your bags packed when you go to Tribal Council. <br/>Colby: Oh, you combed your beard. I've got to do that today. My only loyalty is to Tina. There is no other loyalty for me, so it could be Keith or Elisabeth I'm going to vote for. I think both of them need immunity to save themselves at this point. <br/>Jeff: All right. You guys've been out here 39 days. Your once strong bodies are withering away. The question is how sharp have you been able to keep your minds? That's what we're going to find out today. Today's immunity challenge requires one thing, memory. There are 36 covers with an item underneath each one of them. 18 matching pairs in all. Your goal, uncover as many of those pairs as you can. One at a time you'll go out and you'll get to uncover two items, any two items you want. If they match up, take it back to your bench. If they don't, you replace the cover-- next person goes. The tribe member that gets the most matches gets immunity. All right, so I guess I need that. This thing is molding itself to your neck. <br/>Colby: I hate to give it up today. <br/>Jeff: You're already drawn straws to determine the order. Let's play. Keith, you're up first. Get us started. Nest. Femur bone. All right, Tina. A wooden kangaroo. Gourd. Elisabeth. An emu egg. Wooden kangaroo. Colby. Wooden kangaroo. And a match. One match for Colby. Keith, you're up. Snake, a wooden snake. Wooden turtle. Bullroarer. Jawbone. There's the urchin. Nicely done, Tina. Nice job, good match. Flute. Another match for Colby. Nice match, Keith. Still anybody's game. Elisabeth. Call this roo doo. Kangaroo doo. <br/> Colby: Why don't you pick that up off the plate there, Elisabeth? Looks like burnt marshmallows. <br/>Jeff: Boy, you are hungry. Clay pot. <br/>Colby: Oh, nice! <br/>Jeff: Out of the blue. I'll take that. Nice match, Keith. Colby, he's catching up to you. Here's where we're at, guys. Colby gets one more right, he clinches victory, wins immunity, can't be voted out tonight. Colby, you're up. Jawbone. Does he remember? <br/>Colby: No, he does not. <br/>Jeff: You were the one who uncovered it. <br/> Colby: I know and I can't remember where I just uncovered that thing. <br/>Jeff: Jawbone. That's it. Immunity again for Colby. Well done. This has had a permanent home here for a while. <br/>Colby: Been pretty fortunate. <br/>Jeff: You guys have a few hours before Tribal Council. I don't know how you're going to vote, I don't know how you're going to figure this out, but you can head back to camp and think about it. <br/>Elisabeth: Look at them. Two of them. <br/>Keith: Where? <br/>Elisabeth: Right back there. <br/>Keith: Oh, yeah. Colby's mom is gone and we've had our little interlude, our intermezzo, if you will. The game is back on. It's anybody's game right now as far as who's going to be in the last three. Anybody's game. <br/> Colby: No matter what happens tonight, that changes 'cause one of us is gone. <br/>Elisabeth: I know. <br/>Colby: That's a harsh reality. <br/> Tina: There is a sense of doom and gloom about Tribal Council. <br/>Elisabeth: I don't want to go. <br/> Tina: And it seems that the day of Tribal Council people are whispering and talking and a little bit of paranoia sets in, too. You don't have as many people to choose from to kick off, you know, there's only four of you and one of you's got to go. <br/>Colby: I still haven't made and one of you's got to go. <br/> Colby: I still haven't made up my mind as far as who I'm going to vote for. It comes down to two things, strategy or philanthropy. On one hand, you got, who deserves it, who's a righteous person, who needs that money? Or the other side, is strategy. How can I get that, how can I put that money in my pocket? That's something we've all weighed from day one, how bad do you want the money? <br/>Jeff: We now bring in the you want the money? <br/>Jeff: We now bring in the jury. The jury has now grown to five. All five of them sitting there, due in no small part to votes cast from the four of you. Tonight, one of you will be leaving this side of Tribal Council and moving to the jury side. Let's talk about what's gone on the last three days. Because in that time span, Colby has had a whole lot of activity going on. Tina, as he wears the immunity necklace again, how frustrating is it to not be able to beat him? <br/> Tina: It's frustrating that he's got all the food challenges, and he goes away and eats and eats and eats, and some of us have got no food. But it's not one of those things that you resent him at all, because on some level you have to admire someone who is that tough of a quality person, who has all those attributes that allows him to win all these challenges. <br/>Jeff: Keith, do you still feel competitive? <br/>Oh, sure, there's no question. Going into the physical challenges are more difficult now because I've lost 27 pounds, this is kind of an astonishing thing for me. And it takes a lot for me to get up to go to fill the truck up with gas and do anything strong physically. Coming in I was very strong, and I was fast, but I've seen it tremendously. <br/> Jeff: Colby, provided you make it to the final two, what kind of impact do you think tonight's vote, how you vote specifically, will have on the jury? <br/> Colby: That's by far the toughest part of this part of the game. You sit here and you throw around the word "strategy." Well, if you're playing strategically, you've got to look at them and think if you're going to be strategic, you've got to think about what they're thinking. We have no idea. And you can, you know, maybe up your stock or cut your throat in the same night and you won't know until it's too late. <br/> Jeff: Elisabeth, why are you voting the way you're voting tonight? What's it based on? <br/>Elisabeth: I vote on my gut. I have always since I was little, I mean, my parents have taught me let your conscience be your guide, and I have a very strong conscience, I have a very strong gut instinct, and that's how I voted from day one. Um, and I just, I think about the right thing, and I do it. <br/>Jeff: Let's vote. Keith, you're up. <br/>Keith: I said it before, I'll Keith, you're up. <br/> Keith: I said it before, I'll say it again, I think you're an absolutely wonderful person, and some day I would love my daughter to spend a day with you because I think she can learn a great deal from you. Good luck to you, Elisabeth. <br/>Elisabeth: Even though you've Good luck to you, Elisabeth. <br/> Elisabeth: Even though you've calmed down your cockiness a bit, because I think we've all felt a little more vulnerable lately, you're still my vote. Nothing personal today. <br/>Jeff: Once the votes are Nothing personal today. <br/>Jeff: Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final. The person voted out of the tribe will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Elisabeth. Keith. Elisabeth. Last vote... Elisabeth. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Elisabeth: Go get them, guys. Play hard, and try and wear that thing. <br/>Jeff: Elisabeth, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Good-bye. Well, it's come down to this. Three days, two Tribal Councils, one winner. Head back to camp. <br/>Elisabeth: My part of the game is over. It's been the most trying experience of my life. Filled with the most highs and lows in a short period of time that I could have ever imagined. I know that they just didn't want me to get into the final two because I would have kicked some major butt in that situation.
