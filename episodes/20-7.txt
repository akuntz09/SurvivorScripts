<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor: Villains win immunity! <br/>Yes! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: For three long weeks the Heroes had been perfecting the art of  failure. Villains have now won four out of five immunity challenges. To make matters worse, Colby, a consistent winner in seasons past, was  tangled in mediocrity. <br/>He has not done anything. It's, like, my superman sucks. <br/>Probst: Meanwhile, the Villains appeared to be invincible. <br/>I feel so... [growls]. <br/>You feel like a big man? <br/>Probst: But the announcement of a double Tribal Council... Tonight, both  tribes are voting somebody out. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: ...exposed the villain's Achilles' heel; a rift between Russell and  Boston Rob. I don't trust Russell's ass at all. He's like the hobbit on crack. <br/>It's personal with me and Rob. I don't think he knows who he's dealing with. <br/>Probst: Danielle and Parvati were firmly in Russell's camp, with Sandra,  Courtney and Tyson in Rob's. Both sides were vying for the attention of the dragon slayer and his fair  maiden. But right before Tribal Council Russell planted a seed in Tyson's head,  suggesting he vote out Parvati. <br/>I'm going to vote for Parvati, and then that will be it. I don't like doing it, but I got to. <br/>Deal. <br/>All right, man. <br/>Yup, we're tight, dude. <br/>Probst: But at the Villains' Tribal Council, Russell pulled a double cross by  giving Parvati his hidden immunity idol. She played the idol, Tyson took the bait, and Boston Rob's closest ally went  home. Tyson, the tribe has spoken. Later, when the Heroes took their seats at Tribal Council, Colby dodged a  bullet when the tribe voted out James because he was injured. Now, only five Heroes remain against eight Villains. against eight Villains. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>I've played Survivor three times now, and for the first time in all of those  times, I was shocked last night. I completely didn't know what happened. The more and more I think about it, something doesn't feel right. Something just doesn't feel feel right. Let me tell you something, dude, somebody said something to him. <br/>He didn't want to tell you. <br/>Who cared? That's so stupid. <br/>Well, he's not here anymore, is he? is he? <br/>It just hurts all of us. <br/>It just hurts all of us. We need to knock them out. Danielle's dumb as a bag of rocks anyway. Both Parvati and Russell can do some damage. <br/>It's no secret that Russell has a little-boy crush on Parvati because he's...  I mean, let's face it, he's like a bandy-legged little troll who, you know,  sort of, like, scampers around with his tooth missing and, you know, is in  and out of the bushes and never washes. And she pays attention to him, And she has, like, no problem flirting with  clearly anything that walks. that walks. <br/>My hero! [chuckles]  My hero! [chuckles]  That was awesome last night. <br/>Awesome, wasn't it? <br/>Y'all two need, y'all two  Y'all two need, y'all two need just to work on Jerri. need just to work on Jerri. [Parvati laughs] Y'all two together can do it easy. [women giggling]  I don't understand how they can be so cocky right now, making fun of people. How can they do that, Jerri? There's three of them, there's five of us. [giggling continues] I was born at night, but not last night. To me, it's ridiculous that three people would have so much confidence unless  something else was going on. <br/>I'm socrafty. [laughs]  I don't know if they were just excited because they pulled over a big, stupid  move or if they think that they have numbers on the other side and the merge  is coming soon, or possibly if two of those people that are sitting with me  in the tent pretending to be mad at the other three are actually with them,  and the are actually with them, and the joke's on me. joke's on me. joke's on me. [Danielle groans] [Danielle groans]  What's up, girl? <br/>I didn't sleep for crap, man. <br/>I didn't either. <br/>It was cold. <br/>It wascold. <br/>My blanket was halfway off my body. That's why I was freezing. <br/>That was hard. <br/>Rob started yet? <br/>Started? <br/>Started his ranting and raving? <br/>No, everybody's still sleeping-- well, relatively sleeping. I think everybody's really depressed. <br/>I ain't depressed. They're depressed. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Just think of you as on the outs like them, you know? Depressed like that andgoing mad. That ain't a good feeling. <br/>No. <br/>If you have a tight alliance with four people, five people, you can get all  the way down to the end if you, if you stick together. That's how people get far in this game. <br/>I think Jerri has all kind of respect for me now, because I put my butt on  the line for somebody else. Now she has an alliance that she has to start a relationship with. Jerri hated Parvati. I brought them together. But I'm that good where I can bring people together in this game for mygood. <br/>I'm just... I'm afraid to commit. I mean, I'll be honest. I-I've had my trepidations with you from the beginning. <br/>If people are worried about me, then, I mean, there's just-- what can I say? I've been, like, [laughs] I've been the target of every single vote because  everyone thinks I'm gonna get with my people. Why would I do that? Because it doesn't make sense for me leave a solid tribe. <br/>I guess it's, maybe I have fears of commitment. Maybe that's why I've been single for three years. [laughs] It hurts my brain. <br/>Jerri's completely noncommittal. I thought I was noncommittal. She's, like, "People have hurt "my feelings in the past, and  "I've just not gotten over that "for 38 years. "I've been harboring resentment "for the people that have lied to  me and hurt my feelings." Well, listen, crazy pants, it's like a 3-3  split right now: It's me, Russell, and Danielle on one side, Rob, Sandra and  Courtney on the other side, Coach and Jerri right in the middle, you know? They don't know which way to go. They don't know which way to go. "Which way do we go?" "Which way do we go?"  Isn't it proof? <br/>Isn't it proof? The girls in Micronesia. The girls in Micronesia. <br/>It's up to you. I mean, like, we can't do anything else other than top four. That's it. But I think Jerri is leaning more towards coming with us because she saw what  Russell did for me, and I think, I think Jerri's a little bit jealous that a  man hasn't done that for her, so I think she wants to take a chance for with  Russell. Maybe he'll save her life and she can have a hero. she can have a hero. [birds calling] [birds calling] [birds calling]  It's really cold. <br/>It's really cold. <br/>Oh, God, my knees hurt. Everything sucks. Poor James, damn it. If we ever needed somebody to step up, we need Colby to step up today. Tribal Council last night, we ended up putting James out of our camp. I don't know exactly if that was the right decision or not, but we've got to  keep strong. We cannot let the Villains keep winning. <br/>Unbelievable. I have survived two, if not three hugeTribal Councils where going into them,  I was convinced I was going home, but, uh, here I am. <br/>Oh, my God, he's going to come back with a vengeance. <br/>Yeah. <br/>He's got something to prove today. <br/>There's a little bit of pressure on me to perform 'cause clearly, if James'  knee had held up, I wouldn't be here. So now it's put up or shut up time for Colby. I'll do everything I can to make you guys realize you made make you guys  realize you made the right decision. the right decision. the right decision. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Villains getting your first look at the new Hero tribe. James voted out the last James voted out the last Tribal Council. Tribal Council. You guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Oh, yeah! <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, three members of each tribe will race through  the water to get a ball. You must then work together until you can shoot your ball in your basket  while members of the other tribe attempt to stop you any way they can. Each time you get a ball in your basket, you score a point for your tribe. First tribe to three wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: The winning tribe will leave here and be taken to an outdoor  waterfall. You'll enjoy a nice healthy lunch.

Villains, you have three extra members; sitting three people people out. Cannot sit out the same people in back-to-back challenges. You have to sit out three women. Courtney, Sandra...

Big scramble for the ball. Coach now has it for the Villains! Coach now with a free shot. <br/>Wide open, Coach! <br/>Probst: Not even close. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Coach with the rebound and the opportunity to score, but he blows it. <br/>Come on! <br/>Probst: Colby knocks Coach down, takes the ball, racing to the hoop. <br/>Come on, Colby! <br/>Probst: Colby scores for the Heroes! Heroes lead, one-zip. Next round. Two women from each tribe along with one man. Heroes lead it one-zip. We're playing to three. <br/>Let's go, girls. <br/>Probst: Survivors ready? <br/>Probst: Survivors ready? Go! Go! Villains need to score. Candice takes Danielle down, leaving Amanda open. Once again, Coach and Colby matching up. Colby has had Coach's number in this challenge. He eludes him again. Colby comes up short. Coach now for the Villains. <br/>Get it, Colby! <br/>Just hold him, Candice. <br/>Coach, it's a chick! Come on! Get it to Danielle! <br/>Get it, Jerri! Get in there, Jerri! <br/>Come on, Jerri! <br/>Probst: Colby now takes it from Jerri, over to Candice. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Candice in and out for the Heroes. Candice misses. Coach has it again, launches a long shot. Colby just tosses Jerri out of the way. Heroes way more aggressive in this challenge. Colby to a wide-open Amanda. Danielle blocks Amanda twice. Candice has it for the Heroes, Candice scores for the Heroes! Heroes lead two-zip! <br/>Good work, team! <br/>Yeah. Probst: Next round, the men are back out. This could be it. Heroes lead 2-zip. Villains have yet to get on the board. We are playing to three. <br/>Come on, Heroes! Finish it off right now! <br/>Probst: Survivors ready? Go! J.T. sprinting after that ball. Nobody even close to him. Russell takes Rupert down. They're going at it. J.T. has it, passes to Colby underneath the goal. This challenge is over! This challenge is over! Heroes win reward! Heroes win reward! <br/>Yeah! Yeah! <br/>Yeah! Yeah! <br/>We won! Whoo! <br/>We won! Whoo! <br/>Probst: Villains, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. Heroes, been a while since you've had something to to celebrate. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Grab your stuff, head out, enjoy it. <br/>Thanks, Probst. <br/>Have a good day, Jeff. I know we will. <br/>We dropped the hammer on the Villains, and for me personally, I had a lot  riding on this. A win like this today not only buys me a little more time but it relieves the  tension in my it relieves the tension in my in my tribe. in my tribe. <br/>Oh, my...  Today just proves that we are a family. We're together. We're a much stronger team than they are right now. We've got them on our heels, and it's time for a little redemption. <br/>To Heroes! <br/>To Heroes! <br/>Love you! <br/>Fantastic Five! <br/>Oh, look at these! <br/>Yes! <br/>They are. <br/>Oh. <br/>I'm going to have some beef. <br/>I want some beef. <br/>Oh! <br/>If we stay together, us five, nobody can stop us, guys. <br/>Mmm. <br/>You guys, there's another immunity idol. <br/>What are you reading? <br/>At our beach. <br/>What? <br/>Do you want to just read it later, and we'll all read it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>All right. <br/>When Candice pulled that letter out, it brought the game back home. Before then, we were out of the game. We were having a meal. We were having a nice time as We were having a nice time as our Fantastic  Five. our Fantastic Five. <br/>Of course, we all tried to ignore the clue. We had such a good time, such a good thing going for a few minutes, and the  game still creeps back in. <br/>Just couldn't wait, could you, Amanda? <br/>Well, if you're going to read it, read it out loud so everybody can hear it. <br/>Yeah, give everybody the details. Got to read it out loud. <br/>Calm down. I was just wondering. "Another immunity idol is hidden at your camp. Stroll down your beach to the river's bed. Atop the second bridge, you'll see a tree rooted where two currents meet. Behind it, in a shallow grave, it shall be."  Let's not let that come between us. <br/>Yup. <br/>If y'all want, we'll go look for it together. That is for us to use against the Villains. <br/>Yup. <br/>And the cool thing was, immediately, all five players agreed. When we do find it, we'll find it as a tribe, and that is a unified front. And we're all in agreement on that. We're now fighting the good fight as a team, and that's the most positive  thing to come from today was realizing that we are now a tribe of five that  is very now a tribe of five that is very ready to take on the Villains. ready to take on the Villains. <br/>Are you with us? <br/>Well, I'll admit, this morning I woke up, I didn't know where my head was at  or where I was going, or... whatever, and now, I'm... It's like the sun came  out, and I'm, like, "You know what? It's pretty clear as day to me now."  You know, I don't want to swear on my family or anything. I'm so... with me, you and Coach. That's who I want. <br/>Hey, Coach, come here. <br/>Sit down, Coach. You know, man, I want to... I don't how else to explain that you can trust me. You and Jerri I want to take to the top three. That's what I want. That's what... From the bottom of my heart, that's what I want. Parvati-- I don't think I can beat her for the million. I want to take you all to the top three, man, and that's what what I want. <br/>Russell is empowered by this game, because with all the gullible people out  here, he thinks that he can outtalk anybody. So next thing I know, when I come over there to join the conversation-- after  I'm beckoned over, because I don't want to seem paranoid and go right up and  listen in or say, "What's going on?"-- Russell is just sitting  there just spinning a pure line of gold, and Jerri's just hook, line and  sinker. <br/>I'm telling you that I've made my decision, and I hope and pray that you're  going to be there, 'cause you are the only other person in this game that I  can literally look at in the eyes, and say, "I trust you 100%." And  if it's just Russell and not you, I'm not going to feel comfortable, 'cause  I've been with you since day one. <br/>Yeah, Jerri and I are honor-bound to play this game together, but if Jerri  says, "I'm in this wholeheartedly with Russell," I really have no  choice. So, it's just... It's just... I don't know. It's just, the waters are so muddy right now... and Jerri has muddied them. <br/>Honestly, what Russell pulled off last night at Tribal Council-- it took huge  balls. I don't trust Rob. We have a history, and we're old school players, and all that nonsense. You know, I wanted to trust him because of that, but I realize Rob is not  trustworthy. He's not. He proved it. <br/>He proved it six years ago when he was playing a different game, and every  time he said he's going to vote for somebody in this game so far, he's done  it, but I don't want to talk about that first. I'm kind of hurt, because you sit there in front of Russell and me and say,  "Russell, I'm in. I just hope that Coach is, too, but I'm in. I hope he makes the same decision." You didn't talk to me about it. You know, I mean, that... I think that's what hurts. You want to lump me and Russell together in terms of trust. That's crazy. I mean, you just said right now that, you know, basically, that you trust he  and I equal, and I hope that that's not the case...  No, it's not. <br/>...because, you know that you've had bad feelings about Russell. <br/>It's not the case. I'll clear that up right now. It's not the case, because... You know, it's just not. And, I mean, you and I are in a really good position, and I'm... It just...  You know what? It just finally made sense to me. <br/>I just can't believe you just threw all your eggs into Russell's basket. <br/>Well... I wouldn't say, all my eggs. So as much as I like Coach, that guy is so naive. Like, Russell is in this game to play it, and he's in it to win it. And you know what? So am I. So as much as I like Coach, and as much as I trust him, I mean, I don't see  someone who gets it, like, in the grand scheme of this game. He's almost dead set against manipulating anybody. He wants to be the good guy to everyone, and you can't. You can't be the good guy to You can't be the good guy to everyone and win  this game. everyone and win this game. everyone and win this game. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Let's do it! <br/>Probst: First things first. I will take back the individual immunity necklaces from last time. Thank you, Candice. Thanks, Rob. Individual immunity-- not today. Tribal immunity is once again back up for grabs. For today's challenge, three members of each tribe will race relay-style up a  platform and across a net. You'll then climb up a large rope web to retrieve bags of puzzle pieces. Once you've collected all six bags, the two remaining tribe members must use  those pieces to solve a puzzle. First tribe to get it right wins immunity, guaranteed at least one more day  in this game. Losers go to Tribal Council where somebody will be voted out. Villains, you have three extra members. Cannot sit out the same people in back-to-back challenges. Who are the three you're gonna sit out? <br/>Myself, Danielle and Russell. <br/>Probst: Jerri, Danielle and Russell sitting out. Take a spot on the bench. We'll get started. Running for the Heroes, we have Rupert, Colby and Candice. On the puzzle, J.T. and Amanda. Running for the Villains-- Parvati, Courtney, Coach. On the puzzle-- Boston Rob and Sandra. For immunity, survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, Rupert! <br/>Probst: Rupert on the busted toe. Parvati dives head first. <br/>That's it, Parvati. <br/>Probst: Rupert takes a tumble. Got to get up that rope web. Get down with a bag. Parvati has hers. Rupert has his! <br/>Hold on...  Come on, Rupert! <br/>Come on, Parvati. [Russell grunts]  Probst: Rupert falling down again. Got to be hard to run on that toe. <br/>Courtney! <br/>Let's go, Courtney! Let's go! <br/>Probst: Go, Courtney, go! Go, Candice! <br/>Go, Courtney! [Courtney gasps]  Probst: Courtney goes down. Candice goes down. <br/>Go, Courtney! <br/>Probst: Like running on a trampoline. <br/>Come on, Candice! <br/>Probst: Courtney and Candice. Courtney has the second bag for the Villains. She drops and pops. <br/>Go ahead, Courtney! <br/>Go, Courtney! <br/>Probst: Candice lost some time for the Heroes. Go, Coach! <br/>Here you go, Coach! Come on, boy! <br/>Probst: Go, Colby. Colby tried to take the side, thinking that will help, but it doesn't. Coach is down with the third bag for the Villains. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Colby has the third bag for the Heroes. <br/>Come on, Colby! <br/>Come on! [shouting]  Probst: Parvati back out on the course for her second bag. <br/>Go! <br/>Go, Parvati! <br/>Probst: Rupert back out on the course for his second bag. <br/>You got it, Parvati! [overlapping shouting]  Probst: Parvati has to go high now, way high. She has it, it drops... on her booty and pops right up. Rupert has the fourth bag for the Heroes. [overlapping shouting]  Probst: Go, Courtney. <br/>Courtney! Courtney! <br/>Probst: Go, Candice. Courtney, once again, falls. <br/>Come on, Courtney! You got it! <br/>Probst: Candice running it. She's learned from her first time. Candice just made up a lot of time for the Heroes. <br/>It's all you! <br/>Grab it! <br/>Probst: Candice has her bag. <br/>Go, Courtney! <br/>Probst: Courtney's struggling. <br/>It's all right! It's okay! <br/>Jump, Courtney! <br/>Jump, Courtney! <br/>Probst: Courtney does not want to jump. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Fall flat! Candice back with her second bag. <br/>Oh. <br/>Probst: Colby heading out for that last bag for the Heroes. <br/>Come on, Colby. <br/>Probst: Courtney lost a ton of time for the Villains. <br/>Come on. <br/>Probst: Go, Coach. <br/>Get it, Colby! <br/>Come on, Colby! <br/>Probst: Colby has the sixth bag for the Heroes. He drops and pops right up. <br/>You got it! Go, Coach! <br/>PROST: Once he touches that mat, start working on the puzzle. <br/>Go, Coach! <br/>Probst: Coach has the sixth bag for the Villains. Faster you get back, the more time you have to work on that puzzle. <br/>Lot of time. <br/>Probst: Start working on the puzzle. <br/>It's a puzzle, you guys. We got it. <br/>Probst: J.T. and Amanda working together for the Heroes. Sandra and Boston Rob working together for the Villains. It's no secret, Rob very good at puzzles. Heroes have had their hands full going up against the Villains when it  involved a puzzle. Big immunity on the line. Heroes lose, they will be down to four tribe members left in this game. A lot of pieces to this puzzle. Patience will pay off. J.T. and Amanda starting to piece it together. Heroes getting closer. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Probst: Rob and Sandra falling behind. <br/>Let's go, guys. Let's go. <br/>Don't panic. Relax, relax. <br/>Probst: J.T. and Amanda doing a great job on this puzzle, expanding the lead. Rob and Sandra switching sides, trying to mix it up a little. Will it help? Will it help? Heroes only a few pieces away. Heroes only a few pieces away. Rob and Sandra struggling, scrambling. It's not going to matter. <br/>Nice square. <br/>Probst: Four pieces left for the Heroes. Three pieces. Two. One. [cheering] Heroes win immunity! <br/>Yes! Yes! Yes! <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>We did it! We did it! <br/>We did it! We did it! <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Heroes, congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you, Jeff! <br/>Probst: No Tribal Council tonight. <br/>Yes! Thank you. <br/>Probst: Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Nice work. Villains, Tribal Council tonight. One of the eight of you going home. You have the afternoon to figure out who it's going to be. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you at Tribal. <br/>I thought Courtney was lagging. Poor girl, you know, she was, like, almost broken in half out there. We need to get rid of Courtney tonight. tonight. She's the weak link. She's the weak link. <br/>We just got back from our immunity challenge, and got our butts kicked. Rob-- he got his butt kicked today. Sandra wasn't doing anything on the puzzle. Courtney looked like she was about to break in half out there. It was one of the most pitiful performances I have ever seen. Yeah, right now, the Heroes are starting to win. Uh, we have to do something. <br/>What do you think? <br/>I think we need to weed off the weak. <br/>Who do you suggest? <br/>One of these. <br/>One of who? <br/>One of who? <br/>Right here. <br/>Right here. What do you want me to say? <br/>I don't know. <br/>You want me to be, you know...? <br/>That's not a way to gather friends, I don't think. <br/>Well, you know. <br/>[laughing]: How do you two feel about that? <br/>I don't like it. <br/>Oh, no, I think... I think he's right. <br/>What kind of logic is that, Russell? That's a new one. <br/>No hard feelings for nobody. It's really just a game for me. I don't put my...  I don't think I ever quite heard that... Sit with someone and tell someone  that, I want to vote you or you off. I never heard that approach before. <br/>You never? <br/>No. <br/>You'd be amazed how good that approach works sometimes. <br/>That's a new one. <br/>Well, if Rob's gonna vote for one of us, he's obviously not going to say it  in front of us, and we're not gonna vote for ourselves. <br/>Oh, I'm not gonna vote for one of you. <br/>All Rob wants is to keep his alliance strong, which I understand, 'cause he  knows, once Courtney leaves, he's at my mercy. I'm after him. He's after me. May the best man win. Whoever's better in the game-- that's which one is going to be here longer,  and it's going to be me, and he sees it coming. be me, and he sees it coming. <br/>Tough one. <br/>Tough one. What's the plan? <br/>We've got two decisions. Blindside Parvati, or get rid of Courtney and regroup the alliance. 'Cause that was pathetic today, dude, and I... Dude, in Courtney, man, I  don't know what you see, man. She is the w... We have to dance around every challenge because of Courtney. And Sandra. <br/>She's loyal. I mean, that's something that you value, right? It's something I value, too. You really think Parvati's more of a threat than Russell at this point? I'll make a strong case for Russell because I think he's dangerous, Coach. And from day one, I haven't trusted him, and I don't... I still don't. Not that I trust Parvati, either. But, I mean, how does Jerri feel? <br/>I haven't talked to her. I talked to you first 'cause you're my right-hand man. I mean, dude, I'm telling you right now, as sure as anything, I want to be  standing there with you on the last day. <br/>We will be. We will be. <br/>All right. <br/>You have my word. I'm voting for Russell. I have yours? <br/>Yup. <br/>Okay. <br/>Let's get that little bastard out of here. <br/>That's it. That's it. You know, one way to make somebody do what you want them to do is to find  what they hold dear. With Coach, it's his reputation for being loyal. And put that on the line. You're saying that you're giving your word, and that you're the most loyal? You better do what you say you do, or let it be known that you're a liar. <br/>All right, well, Courtney tonight, and then it will be Sandra. Get rid of them two snakes right off the bat. <br/>Where's Parvati? <br/>She's back at camp, I think. <br/>I know, man. You know what? He's been trying to get rid of you since day one, and that takes a pretty big  man to not make the target. <br/>Right. I mean, I'm trying to keep the team strong. He's constantly trying to get rid of me. rid of me. <br/>Constantly. <br/>Constantly. <br/>We got to... We got... I tell you, mean, we got...  I want to so bad. <br/>I know you do. <br/>I want to so bad. <br/>You're a big man for not, though. I got to give it to you. <br/>I know. We could do it now. <br/>Let's think about this. <br/>That's just disgusting, man. <br/>Let's think about this a while. Me and Coach-- we can beat any two guys they pair up. I don't care. In anything. <br/>Wow. <br/>We can all do that, man. We can...  Right, now, but I just... I feel like the right thing to do is Courtney. It's going to make our tribe stronger. I feel like the right thing to do is Courtney. <br/>What do you think, Jerri? <br/>I mean, what's the positive of keeping Rob in, besides keeping the tribe  strong? He's a mover and a shaker. <br/>I say we can. <br/>I mean, he can't be trusted. <br/>And you agree with it, and she agrees with it. Parvati would. That's four votes, Coach. <br/>Come on, man. <br/>I'm ready to get rid of that fool. <br/>I know. Let's not do it. I don't feel right about it. <br/>Why? <br/>Yeah. Why? <br/>It's the perfect time before the merge. <br/>Dude, I don't feel right about it. <br/>Dude, I feel the merge is coming. <br/>Rob is, like, the biggest threat right now. <br/>If you give me your word, I'll believe you. I'll believe you. <br/>I'm with you guys 100%. <br/>I'm with you guys 100%. I came here to win this game. Not at all costs. I don't want Boston Rob to go home. That's what you can see on my face right now. I don't want him going home. He doesn't deserve to go home. He deserves to be here and play this game. I can't go back on my word. I mean, I just gave those guys my word because Russell crammed it down our  throats, and Jerri's being gullible, and just saying, okay, whatever. And then I'm sitting there like a fish out of water. What am I going to do? So now, if I go against them, then, you know, I broke my word. I want to be true to Boston Rob. I want to be true to Boston Rob. [sighs] [sighs]  This game is such a trip. <br/>They're coming after me. <br/>You think so? <br/>They want me out? <br/>You think so? <br/>I don't know. I'm asking you. <br/>Oh, I don't know. <br/>No? It's hard. Don't sweat it, Jerri, you know? It's a hard decision. You got to do what's best for you. <br/>It's giving me a headache, man. <br/>Do what you think is best for you. I don't even see it as that much of a choice. Like, you know what to do. [Jerri laughs] You do, but you're... I am at your mercy. I don't have a leg to stand on. <br/>I mean, you know, I would love to just go, "Hey, Rob, you know, I trust  you 100%," but...  But you shouldn't? <br/>I can't. <br/>But you can trust me in this situation, because you can always trust somebody  when they have... when their backs are against the wall. Because I don't really have any other choice. You're smart, Jerri. You figure it out. [Jerri laughs] [Jerri laughs] You know what to do. You know what to do. [sighs]  I feel like I've aged, like, five years in one day. I mean, Rob literally told me... He said, "Look, Jerri, you know, just  do whatever you got to do to get yourself as far in the game as you can, and  if it's at my expense, I... I understand. It's a game."  You know that it's not the right time to get rid of Boston Rob, right? 'Cause if that happens, you know, like, challenge-wise, I'm not for that at  all. At all. <br/>I'm not a good villain. [Jerri laughs]  Not a good what? <br/>I'm not a good villain. <br/>I'm not a good villain. I'm just not. I'm just not. <br/>Probst: For the first 15 days of this game, you guys were dominating, but  then, the Heroes have stumbled onto this magic number of five and have  destroyed you guys. So, Sandra, how is tonight's vote different? Before, you guys thought you had no competition out there. <br/>Um, I think we're all over the board. It's going to be all kinds of names and numbers out there today. I don't know what to tell you, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Coach, if Sandra's right, is that indicative of a tribe in trouble? <br/>I think that at the dawn of every morning, hope springs eternal. I personally saw, with the absence of Tyson, not only a great competitor, but  also somebody that kind of bridged the gap. <br/>Probst: Where's the gap? <br/>I mean, you've got, um, you know, Sandra and Courtney. They're tight with Boston Rob. And then you've got Danielle, Russell and Parvati. And that's another group. And then you've got Jerri and I have been the floaters. So, as you can see, it's just like everybody is going in different directions. And Tyson was the guy, in my opinion, that bridged that gap. <br/>Well, see, I don't agree with that at all. <br/>I disagree with that completely. <br/>I think by getting rid of him, it solidified a stronger group of people. <br/>Probst: But Danielle, you and Russell disagreeing with what Coach says confirms  what Coach says. <br/>People can have different opinions, even if they're on the same tribe. <br/>Probst: Rob, you had one of the craziest Tribal Councils last time that I've  ever seen-- 20 seasons. This is not a tribe that's working together. <br/>It's not a tribe that's working together. And I agree with Coach. I think losing Tyson was a big mistake, and it hurt us tremendously. <br/>But I could have blindsided anybody that night. My alliance, Parvati, was about to go home. So I made the best move I thought that was possible. And it was my decision. <br/>And a lot of people are mad about it, and a lot of people haven't gotten over  it, and it shows in challenges. <br/>I personally don't think that that's true. I think that a lot of us are giving 100%, but everybody is so damn paranoid  about alliances, and it's going to continue to be like that. <br/>It's catastrophic, because some people are thinking in terms of keeping their  alliance strong, instead of keeping the team strong. <br/>Well, you know what? He put my name down. He didn't know I was going to blindside Tyson. That's keeping the team strong? <br/>I think it is keeping the team strong. <br/>I'm going to use Rob's quote. "If you ain't with me, you're against me."  That's right, and you are against me. It's clear. And, I mean, there's been no secret about that, Russell. What I'm saying, my idea of trust and loyalty is different from Russell's. <br/>Loyalty? I put my butt on the line for my...  I saw what you did. <br/>...for my people. <br/>I saw what you did. <br/>I was willing to go home. If that ain't loyal, I don't know what is. I don't think you have the guts to do what I did last Tribal. <br/>Okay, you're entitled to your opinion. <br/>If you're gunning for me, you're not going to get what you want, not with me. You're going to have to go. <br/>Probst: Coach, where's your level of trust with these guys? <br/>I mean, I see two soldiers on opposite ends of the spectrum. You hear the fight in both of them. You hear the independence in both of them. So, I know that the lines have been drawn in the sand today, but I'm begging  you guys to reconsider and keep this tribe strong. I mean, we can still win every single challenge, but not if our best  competitors are going to be at war with each other. <br/>But at some point, you pick someone to trust, and you go with that, and  that's all there is to do, and I did that. And I think tonight's vote is going to be to bring this tribe closer together. <br/>Probst: Jerri, literally, you're sitting in the middle of this group, and  your name has not come up at all. <br/>I've been confronted, one by one by, by everybody in this tribe, and both  sides have some positives and some negatives, and I've tried to weigh both. So I'm forced to make a decision, and I'm hoping that it's the right one, and  I don't know for sure if it is, sometimes, but I have decided sometimes, but  I have decided that I have to believe it is. that I have to believe it is. <br/>Probst: Well, there's no doubt that tonight's Tribal Council is going to mark  a turning point for this tribe. Let's get to it. Let's get to it. Danielle, you're up. Danielle, you're up. <br/>It's game over. <br/>It's game over. It's either you or me. It's either you or me. <br/>I'm making a choice tonight in hopes that this will be right in hopes that  this will be right for me in the end. for me in the end. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes.

Well, that is without question, the biggest move this tribe has made in the  game thus far. Good news is, not going to take long at all to find out if voting out Rob  brings this tribe back together or destroys it. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor--the competition gets dirty, but the real  battle is at the Villain's camp, where every alliance crumbles. <br/>Coach is a pathological liar. <br/>Russell is a bully. <br/>Every single person on this team is an idiot. <br/>I can't stand Jerri, I hate Coach, I hate Danielle, I hate Russell even more. Why are you blaming me and Courtney? <br/>No. <br/>No. <br/>Pray for the merge. <br/>Pray for the merge. <br/>I mean, I saw it coming tonight. It's tough. These guys-- they knew what they were doing. You know, I wish Coach would have kept his word. I pretty much knew that he was going to do what he thought was in his best  interest. I did as much as I could for my tribe to put them on my shoulders and carry  them as long as I could, but at the end of the day, this is what I get in the  day, this is what I get in thanks.
