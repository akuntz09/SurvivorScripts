<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor: Over the past ten years, some of  Survivor's most memorable castaways played the game with honor and integrity...   In my world, I've always tried to show that good will win. <br/>Probst: ...while others relied on ruthless cunning and backstabbing. <br/>I'm the original villainess of Survivor and I got to tell you, I feel like  Mother Teresa right now with these people. <br/>Probst: In the historic 20th season of Survivor, ten of the most notorious  villains have returned to face ten of the greatest heroes. Russell has the bag for the Villains! The first challenge was a fierce battle. The Heroes suffered two injuries...  Probst: ...but ultimately prevailed. Heroes win reward! Filled with confidence, the Heroes worked well together and built a solid camp. <br/>I love my tribe. We have a good aura, we have good energy. <br/>Probst: But not every Hero acted heroically. J.T. dipped into the Villains' playbook and formed conflicting alliances. <br/>I'm gonna form alliances with everyone I can. So it's gonna be a whole different ball game for me. <br/>Probst: At the Villains' beach, Boston Rob was the only one who worked, and  the camp suffered. <br/>They don't want to build a shelter, they don't want to try to get a fire  going, there's nobody here that wants to do anything. <br/>Probst: But unbeknownst to Rob, Russell was very busy. <br/>We're gonna be better of a pair than you can even possibly imagine. <br/>I agree. <br/>Probst: Up to his old tricks making secret deals with Danielle and Parvati. <br/>With Russell, I definitely feel like I am making a deal with the devil-- but  I want the devil on my side. <br/>Probst: And Coach was making gallant advances towards Jerri. <br/>Jerri and I, we have a little connection. (laughs)  Probst: Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, Heroes! <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, the Heroes opened a huge lead. Heroes look like they've been paddling together forever! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: But when they got to the puzzle, things changed. Heroes still trying to figure out the first piece of this puzzle. <br/>Wait, maybe there's two different pieces that fit...  Probst: Sugar and Amanda were unable to work together, allowing the Villains  to pull ahead. Villains win first immunity challenge! At Tribal Council, the Heroes unanimously voted to make Sugar pay for her  poor performance at the challenge. Sugar, the tribe has spoken. And now both tribes are facing tough questions. Did the Heroes make the right choice to strengthen their tribe? (thunder crashes) As for the Villains, with torrential sea storms on the way,  will the lack of shelter zap their strength and kill any chance of future  victory? (thunder crashing)  (laughs): Paradise, my ass! <br/>Man, it's worse underneath there than it is out here. Pouring down rain, like, five people want to... are ready to die. <br/>It's so cold. <br/>Everybody's crying, and I can't take it anymore. The main thing we should be doing is trying to make a fire and trying to get  our shelter good. Nobody wants to step up, and they want to sit in the rain night after night,  and it's making me physically sick, you know? <br/>Unbelievable, man. (coughs)  It's, like, again, again, again I'm on the buffoon tribe, again. I was on Marquesas, I was on on All-Stars and again now. <br/>I don't know what I'm gonna do. (theme song playing) * *  (sighs): This is... this is rough. People are freaking out. I mean, there was a lot of complaining last night. <br/>It's gonna get worse. <br/>I know, and it's only day four. <br/>It's all gonna come down to... what people got upstairs. <br/>Yep. That's what Rob said. He said, "Here we go. It's the beginning."  So, here we are on day four, on... at least design four, probably design five  of the shelter. The first one was the best and the strongest and semi-leak-proof, and each  subsequent shelter gets worse and worse and worse, and now we're... we're  doing it again. <br/>So the shelter's just gonna come up in the back, then it's gonna come down in  the front. Right? Like a lean-to? But we'll stop it, like, about three feet. <br/>I don't... I think we should keep it low like that, don't you? <br/>I think we should just...  I think we should keep it low and then just put the roof on. <br/>Yeah, let them do what they want to do. I don't think we should complain. <br/>We can make it lower, too. <br/>No, I just, I'm not complaining, I'm just saying an opinion. <br/>Never mind. I got it. <br/>Boston Rob is, like, the bright, shining star, and he just gets so frustrated  with these fools. I hope he doesn't drop dead in the next few days, 'cause we'll all die. There's just no way around it. But if you only do a few bamboo, you don't need to make this, like...  Reinforced. <br/>...structure. Do you know what I mean? <br/>I thought we didn't have a lot of time, so...  Oh, there's the leaves. <br/>Well, this row and that row, it's gonna cover all that. <br/>We're at the Heroes camp. I mean, we're a bunch of professional and seasoned survivors. We're some of the best survivors ever, the greatest. <br/>Let Colby cut that one out. He just marked them. He ought to know just how big y'all need 'em. <br/>Man, I love a working tribe. <br/>I know, isn't it nice? <br/>Yes. <br/>Be with people who know what they're doing. <br/>Should we make coconut, or what do you think? <br/>Roasted coconut? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, popcorn? <br/>Let's do that. <br/>Stephenie. For my game, it is a very good idea for me to get rid of Steph. I mean, she's a sweet girl, but... (growling) ...in the game, I think  Stephenie would side with anyone that got her one day further. <br/>Let it brown a little more like that one, right? <br/>You want it to get crispy. <br/>It's sticking pretty bad. <br/>They're doing popcorn different than I ever did it, so... Cook it dry and  then stir it around in the sea salt. See all that white on the sides-- it's salt. <br/>I don't know. You're the cook. <br/>(growls)  Rupert's starting to get a little bit annoying. Every time you turn around, he's got an opinion about everything. Like the coconut. <br/>Isn't that good? <br/>That's good as hell. <br/>Yeah. <br/>When you make 'em little teeny chunks your saliva mixes in with them enough  that you don't taste the hull as much, and it's popcorn. <br/>I'm just sitting back being quiet. Because he could be trying to get me out of this game. I honestly think the guy is playing out the good guy role out here, and he is  a good guy-- I'm not saying he's not, but it's just, you know, it's overkill  right now. It's day four. Like whoa. <br/>No, we're going to tie each individual one to this. No. With a knife. <br/>I need some more water. The shelter sucks. It's terrible. And you know what I should have done from day one was, "Listen, you're  gonna listen to me. This is the way we're going to do it. If you don't like it, that's fine, I'll mark you down and you'll be voted off  first." I didn't want to be a dictator this time around. I wanted to be the diplomat. And look at where that got me. Running in circles. I mean, they got me, they got me good, they whipped me. And I just-- it, like hit me. I said, "That's enough, it's over, it's done." That's it. <br/>So no more house? <br/>No more. I'm done. You get me, right? You feel me? <br/>I understand. It's frustrating. <br/>Oh, God! <br/>Are you guys going to...? <br/>Why can't we have James and Colby and Tom and Rupert? <br/>How did they get every, like, awesome guy and we got Randy. <br/>Are things going to get better at all, before they get worse? <br/>What's, uh, what's Rob doing? Why did he walk away? <br/>I don't know. I think everybody's kind of having a meltdown, but...  Rob? Hey, Rob? Rob? Talk to me. Rob. Talk to me. What's going on? Will you just open your eyes please? Please, Rob, come on, just look at me. Your head hurts? <br/>Yeah. <br/>What do you want me to do? All right, I'll be right back. Okay? I saw the whole thing, and, uh, it really scared me. I mean, I don't want to see anybody get hurt. This is-- this is where Survivor gets serious, because it involves your life  beyond the the game. And without Rob here, it's going to really hurt us. We're going to slowly spiral down into a big pit of negativity. Which I know is only going to get worse. <br/>All right, you've got the medical team here now. We're going to see how you are. Can you open your eyes for us? <br/>Probst: Rob, can you hear me? Rob? Coming up next: Can you hear me? <br/>Wait. <br/>I feel like... It's getting the best of me. <br/>Probst: Rob, can you hear me? <br/>What's the problem, Rob? <br/>140/70. <br/>All right, got some water here for you, mate. Can you lift your hand up and just pour the water in yourself, yeah? That's the way. Wait. <br/>The funny thing about being unconscious is you don't remember anything. I remember I was feeling really sick and I thought I had to sit down. And the next thing I remember there was a doctor or somebody was talking and  I heard Jeff Probst talking. <br/>Probst: In terms of giving an overall assessment, he looks worse than he is? <br/>At the moment, that's what we're thinking. <br/>Probst: Okay. <br/>And there's nothing that we found on examining him that would concern us. <br/>Probst: Okay. So you were definitely-- you were out. <br/>I feel better though. <br/>Probst: Good. <br/>Oh...  Probst: You look a lot better right now. Yeah. <br/>(sniffs) I'm sorry. <br/>Probst: Why are you sorry? <br/>It's just I feel like... it's getting the best of me. And I love and respect it too much... to not play, you know. <br/>Probst: Yeah. <br/>I'm gonna win this game, dude. Watch this. (laughing) When I finally came to, I had a moment of clarity. And that was, stop trying to be the good guy. Because I'm trying to be so good, I've physically made myself sick. Just do what everybody wants you to do and be the villain. <br/>Probst: You want a hand getting up? <br/>Yeah, dude. There was no way I was going to leave. I mean, Survivor is my life. I love the game. It's given me so much. And there's no way I would ever quit. The doctors checked me out and basically told me I have the flu. Maybe a little case of cry-baby-itis. But, you know, what are you going to do? It's not easy. It's been six years. I just have to start smacking them into shape. <br/>Probst: Mariano's back. <br/>(laughing) Yeah. <br/>Probst: You're on your own. <br/>Okay. <br/>What's happening, man? <br/>I got sick. I got real sick. <br/>We were worried. <br/>I've been having these migraines, man. And I think, uh, with the heat and the exhaustion and everything-- it just  got the best of me. And that's it. I should be good in 48 hours. I was just telling-- I was just telling...  Boston Rob came back. He's not out of the game. Everything's cool. Even though I'm the villain, I still-- I still worry a little bit about stuff  like that. Besides, he's strong. He gives us a better shot to win the challenge. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. Villains getting your first look at the new Hero tribe. Sugar voted out at the last Tribal Council. Guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Probst: First things first. I'll take it back, Jerri. Immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, on my go, two members of each tribe will race to roll  a large tribe-colored crate back to your platform. Then the next two go. Once you've collected all six crates, you must use them to build a staircase  that will spell out your tribe name. First tribe to stack their crates correctly and get all their tribe members  to the top, wins immunity-- safe from the vote. Losers go to Tribal Council where the second person will be voted out from  this game. In addition to immunity, you're also playing for reward. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Probst: Tarp, rope, nails. Should help keep you dry out here. History on this challenge. J.T., Coach and Tyson all played this challenge in their season. They're on opposite tribes today. See how it plays out. Because it runs in pairs, we need to even up the tribes. That means, Villains, you're sitting out two people. Who's it going to be? <br/>Courtney. <br/>Probst: Randy and Courtney going to sit this one out. Heroes, you're sitting out one person. Who's it going to be? <br/>I guess I'm sitting out. <br/>Probst: You don't look happy, Rupert. <br/>I don't know that I can run as well with a broken toe. <br/>Probst: Rupert sitting out for the Heroes. Sit-outs, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize, we'll get started. <br/>Just, everyone let J.T. talk. <br/>It's going to be like our last immunity challenge with the puzzle at the end. We have to win today, bottom line. 'Cause if we lose, we're in bad shape. <br/>That's right, one voice. <br/>Yes, that's right. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Here we go, for immunity and reward. Survivors ready? Go! It's J.T. and Cirie for the Heroes. Danielle and Boston Rob for the Villains. J.T. and Cirie doing a good job, straight down the course. Rob and Danielle a little off course. <br/>Come on, Rob, you got this. <br/>Probst: These crates are very heavy. Once your crate hits the platform, the next two can head out. Go, Heroes. Tom and Candice heading out for the Heroes. <br/>Come on, you guys got it. <br/>Probst: Rob and Danielle really slowing down at the end. Go, Villains. Sandra and Tyson heading out now for the Villains. Candice and Tom increasing the lead for the Heroes. <br/>Come, on, come on, come on. <br/>I got it, I got it. <br/>One more. <br/>Go. <br/>Probst: Go, Heroes. Colby and Stephenie heading out for the Heroes. Tyson and Sandra slowing down. <br/>Come on, don't quit. Let's go, let's go. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Probst: Heroes are holding on to a one crate lead over the Villains. Go, Villains. Jerri and Coach heading out for the Villains. While Colby and Stephenie head back with that third crate for the Heroes. <br/>Bring it home. <br/>Probst: Go, Heroes. Heroes have three crates back. Villains with two. Coach and Jerri heading back with that third crate for the Villains. <br/>Come on, you got to push it again. <br/>I am. <br/>Probst: James and Amanda heading back with their fourth crate for the Heroes. There are six total. Russell and Parvati out on the the course. <br/>There you go. <br/>Probst: James just walking that crate back. J.T. and Tom heading out for that fifth crate for the Heroes. Russell and Parvati trying to get back with that fourth crate for the  Villains. <br/>Come on, Parvati, come on. Push, Parvati. You got it, you got it. <br/>Probst: Russell and Parvati back with the fourth crate. Now they're sending out their big guns. Once everybody has gone once, anybody can go. Colby and James heading out for that sixth and final crate. Rob and Tyson have some time to make up for the Villains. <br/>Good job, guys. Keep it up. <br/>Probst: Rob and Tyson back finally with that fifth crate for the Villains. Russell and Coach heading out for that sixth and final crate. James and Colby heading back with their sixth and final crate. <br/>Beautiful! <br/>Come on, James, let's do it! <br/>It's like a ball rolling down that aisle. <br/>Probst: Go. Start working on your puzzle, Heroes. <br/>Come on, straight to the wall, straight to the wall. <br/>Ow! <br/>Watch out right there. <br/>Yeah, Russell. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Probst: Go. Villains, start working on your puzzle. You're building a staircase. Your name will be visible along both sides. <br/>Come on, everybody. <br/>Probst: The Villains quickly getting a plan together. <br/>Walk it in, walk it. Okay, so that's the "H." We need a piece-- a piece with just this  part of the "H" and an "E."  Probst: The last challenge was decided by a puzzle. And the Villains won. Heroes looking for some redemption in this challenge. <br/>Yes, yes, yes this is right, this is right. <br/>Now pull it up. Push. <br/>Probst: Once again, Boston Rob is leading his tribe through the puzzle  portion of this challenge. <br/>It's not-- it's not right. <br/>I know. This is the bottom. <br/>Bring it back towards Tom. Pick it up. <br/>Probst: J.T. leading the Heroes. <br/>We have to flip it back one time. <br/>Perfect. <br/>Probst: If the Villains are right, they're getting closer and closer. <br/>Perfect. <br/>Probst: The Heroes' lead has been evaporated. <br/>Good job. What's next? <br/>Come on, you got to work you got to work. <br/>Come on, we got to hustle, guys. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>That's not it. <br/>This is not it. <br/>This is it. <br/>This one? <br/>Lift the block! Everybody lift! <br/>Probst: Villains trying to make a big move now. <br/>Push, push it. <br/>Push it up. <br/>Probst: Trying to lift that crate up...  Watch out, watch out! <br/>Probst: ...without crushing each other. <br/>No, wait, we can't do it. We can't push it any further. <br/>Whoa, whoa, whoa. <br/>Probst: Heroes slow and stead, but making a lot of moves. Russell and Coach lifting. Rob pushing! Heroes still working! Both tribes are in this. <br/>Roll it, roll it! <br/>Probst: Villains in a very precarious position. But they have it up! Good teamwork! <br/>We can't do that again. <br/>Good job, Rob. <br/>Rob! <br/>Where the R? Where's the R? <br/>The R's right here. <br/>That's not right. This isn't what should go there. <br/>This one goes... This is it. <br/>Come on, you guys! You guys gotta move! <br/>Spin this. <br/>Come on. Move it over. <br/>This one's it, J.T. <br/>Okay. <br/>I said that in the beginning. <br/>Everybody, come on. Last one! <br/>Probst: Villains think they're very close. <br/>Okay. <br/>Here we go! Here we go! <br/>Just get it up! <br/>That's not...  Yeah, is that right? <br/>That's not right. That's not right. <br/>It's not right. We had it right! <br/>Get it back down. Get it where it was. <br/>Guys, move this over here toward me. <br/>What? <br/>It's not right. It's not right. <br/>Y'all, y'all need to listen to one voice. <br/>Probst: Heroes now starting to get frustrated. <br/>Put it back where it was. <br/>What are we doing? <br/>Straight up. <br/>Push it! <br/>A little bit more! <br/>Probst: Villains have one piece left, but it's gotta come all the way to the  top! <br/>Push it! <br/>Push this. Somebody push this toward me. <br/>Which way? <br/>Spin it that way towards Tom. Go. <br/>No, no, this is not right. <br/>J.T./TOM: Yes! <br/>Shut up! Shut up! <br/>Probst: Heroes talking trash to each other. Not a good sign. <br/>Everybody lifting? <br/>We got it! We got it! <br/>Probst: Villains think they have it. Get to the top, Villains! Villains win second immunity challenge in a row! (Villains cheering)  Let's go home and just relax, dude. <br/>Gotta have one voice, y'all. <br/>Huh? <br/>He was telling y'all what to do. <br/>We were listening. <br/>No, y'all were not. <br/>James, I didn't say...  No, you were not. He was telling you what to do. Everybody's mouth want to talk. One voice. <br/>James, I don't care who you are, I don't care where we're at, you just don't  talk to people like that. The problem is I can't say anything because Rupert already has it out for me  for whatever reason. Maybe I threaten his popularity, I don't know. So I'm just trying to say as little as possible. <br/>Probst: Villains, congratulations once again. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: Two challenges, two victories. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Villains, grab your tarp, rope, nails. Head on back to camp. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Peace out. <br/>Probst: Heroes, gonna be an interesting afternoon as for the second time in a  row, you guys will lose somebody at Tribal Council. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. <br/>Stephenie has been the only person in Survivor history to lose every person  in her tribe to where she's the only one one left. You know, she's obviously the problem. There's no other source of kryptonite in here to suck all the superheroes'  powers but her. And it's, like, wow, you need to go home. <br/>The challenge really sucked today. The last time we-we failed on the puzzle, no one really stepped up, and this  time, I said "Hey, I've done "this challenge before. I'll be the man to run the puzzle." But there was a few people who had  to say, "No, please, please listen to me." But it would have been a  lot easier had people just been listening instead of telling me what to do. <br/>But no one was listening. <br/>Nobody was listening. <br/>Boston Rob is great at puzzles. He yelled and screamed at his team. He told them to shut up. They all listened to him, and he won. <br/>I could have, I could have told everybody to shut up, too, and I didn't. <br/>I just wanted everybody to be quiet and pay attention to what that guy had to  say. <br/>I think it's just imperative...  He was important. <br/>Like, we have to pack our egos at the door and follow who we designate who's  gonna do the best job for the challenge. <br/>One voice, that's all I asked is one damn voice. And then I get defensive people. Then I get people telling everybody they wrong. I don't want to hear that. One voice next time, y'all. That's the only way to get to the top for us as individuals to shut the ...  up and listen to the guy who's done the challenge. You can't be defensive when you you lose. You have to say, "It's my fault." If you're defensive, you're wrong. There gonna be other challenges like this. And we need to focus, 'cause I ain't never lost this much in my life. That's all I'm saying. This is ridiculous. Y'all need to suck it up. <br/>That panicked scream and anguished cry of James when he got back to the hut,  you know, all right, great, you've been a winner your whole life. I doubt it. I'd love to tell him what a winner is and what a loser, and where he fits  into that-that equation. And once again, that I've got to hold my tongue and not respond to that? That kills me out here. <br/>We have a tarp! Ow! <br/>This is the most exciting moment. (women laugh)  Winning the challenge today was awesome not only because we avoid Tribal, but  also because we got a tarp. So hat's off to Boston Rob. <br/>Who loves ya, baby?! I got something for you! <br/>Boston Rob worked his ass off at the challenge today, no question about it. I respect that. <br/>It's the elusive giant clam. Do you want to touch it? <br/>Oh, I don't know. I'm afraid. <br/>Come on. You can touch my clam. (Jerri laughs)  Nice work, Rob. <br/>Boston Rob thinks that he's in charge. I'm starting to think this just ain't working out. I didn't know his personality was th strong. <br/>Russell! Oh-oh! <br/>What, is there a chicken? <br/>Watch out. <br/>But you know what? This is where I'm in charge. I am King Russell from Samoa. (chickens squawking)  Yeah-eah! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Got a chicken, baby! <br/>We can make chicken soup. <br/>We got a chicken. They trying to catch fish. You gotta catch real food. (chicken squawks)  That's true. <br/>Think about it. She's made it to the end by herself. She was the only person left on her entire tribe. You mean to tell me that's good luck? Obviously not. Something just ain't right. And it got to be her. They're gonna get rid of me over Amanda? And we've already lost two? I know it. She's nullified her whole tribe until she was the last one left. <br/>Yep. <br/>It got to be her. <br/>It's a lot different than at first 'cause everyone was okay with Sugar going  home. She was not a part of any solid alliance. Now we're looking at a whole different ballgame because after tonight, I'm in  one alliance in this game. I can either go with James, Rupert and Amanda, and bring Cirie and Candice  along or I can go with Colby, Tom, Stephenie, and bring Candice and Cirie  along. So, one thing that I do know, we gonna piss a few people off. <br/>It's okay. It's as much my fault as any for not pushing harder to be in the challenge. <br/>Okay? <br/>Rupert's over there talking to J.T. now. <br/>Right. <br/>Yeah, they're all...  Right, right. <br/>We're the three on the outs. It's all on the line today. We know what we're up against, and I'm not, I don't have any false illusions  of loyalty from J.T. at this point. This is the way it's gonna go down: the order's gonna be Stephenie, me, you. We have to convince Candice and Cirie that the order's gonna be Stephenie,  Cirie...  ...Candice. <br/>...Candice. If I can get Cirie and Candice to switch over with our threesome, send Amanda  home, then we're controlling this this game. <br/>Right. <br/>So the plan is to get rid of the weakest first, so that would help us if we  got rid of Amanda. The problem with that plan is we don't know if J.T. is with us or not, so if Tom, Colby and myself can pull in Cirie and Candice,  maybe I am safe and we're gonna get our five strong and come out of this all  right tonight. ...but I can guarantee...  Right. <br/>I can promise you that. ...either you or Cirie if we have to go to another Tribal Council, and then  whoever's left of that pass. And I think we've got a better deal for you. <br/>This vote today is crucial because the line will be drawn in the sand, and  you'll be on one side or the other. And I feel like I'm on the bottom of either alliance. So I'm, like, "Which way "do I go? Which way is it worse?" I don't know. I'm really not in a good position anyways, you know what I mean? <br/>I think you're in the position. I think you're the swing vote tonight. <br/>Everybody wants me to vote, you know, one way tonight, but what about me down  the road, you know? <br/>Right. <br/>So, I mean, I really got to think what's best for me. <br/>Yep. So one assurance that you would have: they all go home before you ever go  home. You're not gonna get that deal on their side. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm not even gonna ask you what you're gonna do. You and Cirie are gonna have to decide if this is a move that makes sense to  you. Tom, Colby, Stephenie are writing Amanda's name down. I'm trusting my gut on this. And I think you should trust your gut on this, too, and see where it takes  you. <br/>All right, so what's the deal? <br/>Tell me everything. What's going on? <br/>I just want to do what's best, ultimately best, for the long run, for now. The problem with this decision is, once this decision is made, all the cards  are out. <br/>I know you guys are all tight, and I don't know, like, any of you guys from  before and all that stuff, and, like...  See that's the problem. I don't know why everybody thinks we're so tight. Yeah, me and Amanda made it to the end, but Amanda chose Parvati over me. Amanda cost me a million dollars. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>So, it's not like that. <br/>I need somebody to... that I can trust. <br/>So do I. <br/>And I don't really have anything else going for me, so...  Hello. <br/>I mean... I mean, you know...  I think we have some common denominators. <br/>So, who goes first? <br/>I don't know. Honestly, as long as it's not us, it don't much matter to me. <br/>Hmm. <br/>Probst: J.T., the group of misfit Villains taking the Heroes to the cleaners. <br/>It's pretty embarrassing. You know, I stepped up today, and I didn't come through, you know, so I feel  kind of bad about that. But you know, no one was listening, and I noticed, you know, the Villains--  Boston Rob hollering, told everyone to shut up, and you know, maybe I should  have done that. <br/>Probst: James, you were as frustrated as I've seen you in playing this game  three times. <br/>There only should have been one voice talking, and there wasn't, and I'm  trying to make sure everybody's being quiet, and there was a certain  individual who voiced out their opinion that they were being quiet. <br/>Probst: So who was that? <br/>Stephenie. I said, "Everybody, shut up." "Oh, I'm not talking."  "Baby, I'm not talking to you."  It was after the challenge was over. <br/>Yes. <br/>You looked at me, and you said, "Hey, y'all."  Darlin', your name is not y'all. <br/>All right. <br/>I'll be damned if anybody named y'all in here. <br/>All right. All right. You're trying to blame this entire challenge on me? <br/>I'm not... You see, that's you. <br/>The challenge was over. <br/>Baby, it's not about you. It's really not. <br/>Okay, well, then move on. Move on from me. <br/>No matter how much you want it to be, and how much you crave it to be,  darling...  Here we go again. Oh, my God. <br/>...it's not about you. I was asked the question, and I answered the question, and the person who  tries to cover their back is usually the one who has to. You've been on a tribe where you've lost your entire team. I don't want that to happen. Yeah, it was very romantic that you survived all your teammates on your tribe. <br/>James, this isn't about me. <br/>This is a tribe of winners. <br/>I thought we said it's not about me. Can we get this rolling? It's not about me. <br/>You wouldn't have said nothing, I would have still been talking to y'all. <br/>James, you just attacked her. <br/>I'm not attack...  You expect her to sit here and not defend herself? You just told Probst...  What she said? <br/>...there was one person that caused us such hell today. <br/>Exactly. <br/>So you can not expect her to sit here and not defend herself, James. <br/>And I expect her to defend herself, and I...  And you're continuing to attack her. Now you're getting back to her past season. Just let it be, bro. <br/>The two of y'all-- how about that one? Is that good enough? <br/>Make it the three of them all, okay? Alliances have been made, divisions have been cast in the tribe. You repeating things and just bullying people until...  I'm not bullying people. <br/>...until they back off...  You were bullying Stephenie. <br/>I was not...  Jeff asked who you were speaking about, and you said her name. That does mean her. That doesn't mean y'all. That means Stephenie. <br/>That's how it goes. If you walk up to somebody, and they said, "What? I wasn't doing nothing," usually they're doing something. <br/>Maybe in your world, James. I don't know. I don't live in your world. Anyway...  This is unbelievable. <br/>Probst: Colby, this has to be terribly alarming. We're on day six. <br/>I had no idea it would shift from that team mentality to the  self-preservation this early. <br/>Probst: Stephenie, how concerned are you about past relationships in this  game? Worried that it could work against you that you played with Tom? <br/>Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah, we're friends, but I played against him and merged with him,  and he cut my throat in the end. <br/>Probst: Cirie, you, Amanda and James all played together. What do you do to deflect that? <br/>Um, like Stephenie said, she played with Tom, and Tom cut her throat in the  end. The same thing kind of happened with me and Amanda at the very end. Amanda chose Parvati over me. So if you think that's the route I would want to take again, obviously, you  don't know me. <br/>Probst: Amanda how concerned are you that your past relationships are gonna  come back to haunt you? <br/>Legitimately concerned, because, you know, I've been hearing my name bounced  around, and it's alarming. You know, you get really nervous. You just hope you make the right choices and the right alliances, and then  that's all you can do. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to vote. Rupert, you're up. <br/>It's the plan. You're the weakest. *  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Probst: Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote-- Steph. Amanda. One vote-- Steph, one vote-- Amanda. Steph. That's two votes-- Steph, one vote-- Amanda. Amanda. We're tied. Two votes-- Steph, two votes-- Amanda. Steph. That's three votes-- Steph, two votes-- Amanda. Amanda. Tied again. Three votes-- Steph, three votes-- Amanda. Steph. That's four votes-- Steph, three votes-- Amanda. Second person voted out of Survivor: Heroes Vs. Villains-- Stephenie. That's five. That's enough. Need to bring me your torch. Steph, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Just some advice. Next time, y'all lose a challenge, a little less cursing off your tribe might  help. <br/>Keep your mouth shut. <br/>Oh, come on. <br/>It's been a pleasure. <br/>Probst: Well, I think tonight's Tribal Council speaks for itself. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on...  Go! <br/>Probst: ...Survivor. (groaning)  Whup her ass! <br/>Told you you were on the wrong team, James. <br/>Probst: A Hero spirals out of control. <br/>James got to bring down nasty, brutish bullying. <br/>It's an ugly situation. <br/>I am upset that I'm out of the game. I take comfort in knowing that they definitely made the wrong move by getting  rid of me. These people don't even genuinely try to get to know each other. There was a division since day one. I just definitely wanted to stick around for a lot longer. A lot of people were really threatened by me. I don't think there's anything else I could have done.
