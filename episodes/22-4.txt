<br/>Episode 4 -  <br/>Jeff: previously on "Survivor": At ometepe, Boston  Rob was the undisputed tribe leader. <br/>I am so glad we have Boston Rob. He's amazing. <br/>Jeff: And he found a clue to the hidden immunity idol. <br/>I don't plan on telling anybody about the clue. I want the idol for me. <br/>Jeff: The only speed bumps on his road to the end were Phillip,  who is unpredictable. <br/>Rob going to try to play me like a fool and I'm going to  play along. <br/>Jeff: And crit tina who is a clear threat. <br/>I don't want to have Rob stick around that long. <br/>Jeff: Meanwhile, at zapatera, Russells playing a familiar  game-- he searched for a hidden immunity idol and formed an alliance of  three. <br/>I can trust nobody but Krista and Stephanie. <br/>Jeff: But Ralph had him beat on all fronts. <br/>This is not Russell's game. This is my game. <br/>Jeff: he found the hidden immunity idol and got into an  alliance of six. <br/>Jeff: Ralph's crew was so determined to get Russell out,  they acturally threw the immunity challenge. Ometepe wins their first challenge. <br/>I'm dealing with a bunch of bitches. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, the zapatera did what no other  tribe had ever done before-- they voted out Russell. Russell, the tribe has spoken. His allies are left to fend for themselves. Now Russell's life in the game hangs by a thread. A duel awaits at Redemption Island, and if he loses, he'll be  out of the game for good. Be out of the game for good. <br/>Russell! <br/>Yes. <br/>What's up man? <br/>Russell hantz just walked into my camp. I figured I'd see him sooner or later, but first off. Man, that's a bit of a surprise. <br/>What they told me is the girl beat you? <br/>Really. <br/>My whole tribe lost the challenge on purpose just to get  rid of me. <br/>Are you serious? <br/>This is the first time I've ever been voted out. I was pissed off. I wanted to bitch-slap every one of them. The whole time they were lying to me. They told me Francesca was here, and it isn't. It's this other kid. I mean, it suction because Francesca might have been easier to  beat in challenges. But it doesn't Matter. He's a rookie. So he's going to be nervous as hell doing the challenge against  me, and I'll just take him out. <br/>You were one of my favorite people to watch. <br/>Now we're bunking together. <br/>Yeah, seriously. Blindsided by Rob, bunking with Russell. <br/>That's kind cool. Right now this is his house. I'm about to take it from him. I'm going to keep winning. My tribe is going to come here one at a time, I'm going to pick  them off, and I'm going to make them suffer. I'm going to say, "Sleep in the mud, fool."  This morning, while everybody was trying to sleep, Phillip  was up at the crack of dawn sweeping. He's just a pain in the butt. He's so annoying. And he's so weird. <br/>Saggy-bottom panties. Saggy bottoms. <br/>I could go 39 days without seeing that. Phillip is a piece of work. I mean, who comes on "Survivor" and wears pink  tighty-whiteys with his stuff just hanging out and just flopping around  everywhere. It's not only disturbing. It's actually disgusting. It's like your dad should have bought a new pair like months  ago. You don't want your friend coming over to play and seeing that. <br/>These young people out here, they don't understand me. They don't know if I'm a criminal or a schoolteacher. They don't know how to take me, so I'm a little frustrated out  here. <br/>Just gross. <br/>Given that this is a social game, it's a huge disadvantage  for me. So there has to be another side of me that emerges, the guy  that's under cover. Because I'll tell thu much-- I'm prepared to do what I need to  do to win a million dollars. <br/>Is it bad that I want this day to be over already? <br/>I just try to remove myself from the chaos. Last night, Russell went to Redemption Island. So now Krista and I are here, stuck with all these goobers, and  not really having any fun. <br/>I just hope Russell kills it because they are gonna be  so  He will kill it. <br/>At this point, I'm bummed, but I've got to put the game  face on because one of us is going to go home, unless we find the immunity  idol. <br/>Them girls,they're together. <br/>Let's just keep our eye on them. <br/>I got it under control. I had found the hidden immunity idol, I was planning on nobody  knowing, but Stephanie and Krista left the camp. And thought well, shoot, right now is the fine time to let them  all know. Hey, listen to me, y'all. I found the idol. And right here it is. Man! They all was tickled to death. So now I think I've got them captured to take me further in the  game. I didn't want them to stray off from me. When you got a catch you hang on to it. I told you all I had it under control. The other day--  I didn't know you meant "Under control."  We have the power right now. We're controlling this tribe but I would not be surprised if we  saw Russell back in this game. However, now that we have the idol, if and when he comes back,  it's going to be very, very difficult for him to go deep into this game. <br/>The early bird gets the worm. In this case, he get the mail. Again, it's time to choose who will witness the duel. You can craw stones or you can rochambeau, or discuss it like  civilized folks. Remember, only two can go. I'd like to go. How about you, Kristina, would you like to go. <br/>If everyone says it's okay, I'd like to go. <br/>Yeah, no objection. <br/>I definitely want to visit Redemption Island because of my  background as a special agent with the united states government. I'm looking for a little intel to help me to win this game. <br/>You're going. <br/>You're going. <br/>All right, you guys, I'm going to go with Ralph. <br/>Have fun! <br/>Yes. <br/>I am so excited to watch this, especially with Ralph by my  side and if I am able to watch Russell walk off and go home, that would be my  million dollars, almost. <br/>This duel is going to be man on man, good versus evil type  thing. I like Matt. He's a good guy. If this was the real world, I'd be rooting for Matt, but it's  not. This is survivor. <br/>Russell hantz is definitely the biggest villain in  "Survivor" history hands down, but I'm fighting to honor my god,  and because I want it so deeply and so truly I think I'm going to come out on  top. <br/>Jeff: welcome to Redemption Island arena. Both tribes have sent two tribemembers to witness today's duel. For today's duel, you will stack a series of blocks on a  multileveled platform while avoiding trip wires, which could cause your  blocks to tip and force you to start over. Your goal is to arrange the blocks so they will fall like  dominoes, ultimately releasing the ball, which will smash a tile. The winner of this duel lives to see another day. Loser is out for good. This is it. One shot. Take your spots. <br/>Jeff: here we go. To stay alive in this game. Survivors ready? Go. One person will go back to redemption after this challenge. The other is out of the game for good. Do our die. To further complicate it-- you hit the ropes, the ropes will  wiggle your platform and could cause your blocks to fall. Making sure you have them spaced properly, that is the key. You only have a certain number of blocks, so you can't put them  too close together or you'll run out. We are neck and neck in this duel. Matt may have a slight lead at this point. Russell's going to have to fill in those holes because Matt is  getting closer. <br/>I think I got it. <br/>Jeff: Matt going to give it a go. If he's right, he will stay alive in this game. If not, the door will open for Russell. So far, so good. Matt falls short. He's going to have to restack half of his line. Opens up a huge opportunity for Russell. It looked good. He was just short on one block. <br/>All right, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Russell thinks he has it and he's going to give it a  go. Oh, he just gets through a bit of a hole. And he falls short. Door back open for Matt. Both guys now racing to restack their blocks. You can't ask for more from a million-dollar duel. Win this, your shot at the money stays alive. Lose it, you are going home. Matt has his restacked. <br/>This is it. <br/>Jeff: he's going to give it a go. So far, so good. He's through the tough spot. Will it make it? Matt stays alive! [ applause ]  Jeff: Matt, congratulations. Once again, you seize the moment, and you stay alive in this  game. Russell, brand new for you. You are out of this game. Russell, you have bared your soul out here in ways that very few  have. You have played a very, very strong game two times. [ crying ]  It's all right, buddy. It's going to be all right. <br/>Jeff: Russell is it sadness that you're out of the game? Is it embarrassment at finally losing? <br/>No. I respect this game too much to go out this way. And, you know, people like my tribe that throws a challenge just  to get rid of me because I'm Russell, not even worried about Boston Rob and  his team and numbers. So it's hard to be a professional quarterback and have peewee  leaguers on your team because I've got to run the ball, I've got to catch the  ball, I've got to throw the ball. I have to do everything. <br/>I don't really think so. I think we've done great. Russell would not show us the hidden clue or where the idol was  hidden. But that's beside the point. I'd already found it in 15 seconds in the game. He's got competition on his hands now. <br/>Listen to him talking. He said he found it 15 seconds in the game. Did you show me the idol? <br/>There you go, guys. He has the idol. <br/>Don't do this Ralph. Don't do this. <br/>I faked you. <br/>He faked me. <br/>Jeff: wow! <br/>He has the idol. He's such a good player, he's telling you everything he has  right now. Take him out. <br/>Did I show you one? See how I bluffed him? <br/>Jeff: So, Ralph, you're saying your whole story of 15  seconds in was actually a lie. <br/>Could be, could not be. <br/>It was not a lie. It was not a lie. I earned my living discerning whether or not someone is telling  the truth or not. <br/>You're doing great. <br/>And you have an idol. You'll pRobably get an opportunity to do 2 use it if I have  anything to do with it. <br/>And she's in charge. And Mike and Steve, they're a team as well. <br/>I'm glad I came. <br/>You see, Jeff, I had to stay in this game somehow. Now through these two I can stay in this game. <br/>There it is. <br/>If their tribe wins, they take out these dummies, more  power to me. <br/>Jeff: All right. Russell, your shot at making it to the final four a third time  is over. You are out of this game. You can drop your buff in the fire on your way out. <br/>See you later, man. <br/>Bye, russ. <br/>Take care, russ. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Thanks for the info. <br/>It's just terrible when you play with people that didn't  really come here to play the game. They just came here maybe for fame or just for the money. This is my last time playing this game. That's it. I have nothing else to prove to myself or to my family. Matt, I give him props, beating me, and I hope he goes all the  way. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Jeff: Matt, you survived another duel, my friend. Your journey to get back into this game continues. Grab your stuff. Head back to redemption and await your next opponent. <br/>Good job, Matt! <br/>Good job, Matt. <br/>Go! <br/>Thanks, guys. <br/>Jeff: All right, you guys can head back to camp. As always, what you choose to share with your tribemates, is up  to you. <br/>Thanks to Russell I've learned some very interesting  things today and I'm going to use that to help me. After all it is the game of "Survivor--" outlast,  outwit, outplay. That's what I'm here to try to do. <br/>We should have a beach day today. It's going to be a beach day. <br/>I'm so glad they volunteered. <br/>We can put a blanket on the beach, a crab boil, rice. <br/>Sound good to me. <br/>I started thinking I need to find the hidden immunity idol  before Kristina finds it again. I already had the clue and I had a good idea it was on this side  of camp and I needed to get everybody out of camp for the day. So I created this game. We're calling it royal treatment. The winner gets whatever they want. You can get your rice served to you by whoever you want. So I'm trying to think how am I going to get away from everybody  after I'm the one that planned this whole beach day. My stomach's bothering me a little bit, too. <br/>It is. <br/>Maybe, like, constipated? <br/>Oh, no. <br/>So I tell them I'm having a little bit of trouble moving  things down in that area, you know, and I feel like something might be  happening. <br/>How far down? Or we're going way past. That's a long trek, bro. <br/>This looks good. <br/>So I bring them to the nice part of the beach where the sand  is really nice, and immediately, Grant heads into the ocean, perfect, I don't  have to even look Grant in the eye. I don't have to make an excuse. They'll cover for me. So I look at the girls and I said, "It's time. I have to try to relieve myself." I knew I had a limited  amount of time. So I high-tailed it back to camp, and it's like game on. Where is this thing? The clue, it basically told me it's somewhere on the island,  either in a tree, under a rock, in the sand, or in a log. What a great clue. This is a really weird tree. There's rocks. It should be here. I'm digging through rocks. I'm climbing trees. I'm looking everywhere. And I'm having a really tough time. So I just started searching from tree to tree. <br/>Where's Rob? <br/>At this point, I've already been gone for 15 minutes. I need to get back to the beach. Otherwise, it's going to look suspicious. Where is it? You know, there's pRobably about 40 trees in our immediate area. And I think it was maybe 38 or 39 I finally looked up. Bingo. Ding-ding! We have a winner. Baby, maybe I learned something since last time. As for my plans for it, right now, I'm not sure. <br/>Do you feel better? <br/>I don't want to talk about it. But one thing I do know is that with this immunity idol, this  time I'm going to make it 39 days and win. <br/>Oh! <br/>You blew it! You blew it! <br/>I was going for the win. <br/>Hi, there! <br/>Hey! <br/>That was crazy! <br/>Yeah, so much stuff went down. First they come out, and they started the challenge, which was  really hard. But in the end, Matt won. <br/>Wow. <br/>I am stoked that Russell's out of the game. I still can't believe it. Our plan worked. And I am so relieved that he's not going to come back and get  me. He's gone! Ya! He's gone! <br/>Russell was devastated. Like, he was crying so I hysterically. <br/>He was? <br/>It was awful to see. <br/>It was terrible. <br/>And then he found his Russellness, and just basically  threw back the covers on everything about our camp. Like, he just started throwing out the hit. The point is, he's out. <br/>See you, punk. <br/>Oh, now you're going too much. <br/>Stephanie and Krista showed some emotion that indicated  they were still in camp Russell, which I can understand. I think the fact that everybody else was kind of dancing on his  grave, you know, added insult to injury. <br/>That Matt kid sounds pretty tough. I'm amazed that they got rid of him. <br/>People do some dumb stuff, you know, like throw challenges  when they're ahead. <br/>The tribe is much stronger. He was breaking down the synergy in our tribe. <br/>In the game of numbers, synergy is the last thing you  should be worried about. <br/>I disagree. When you're battling against the other team I think synergy and  chemistry is the most important thing. We had to lose one at one point to get rid of the plague. <br/>Okay, listen, when we go back, we're going to tell them  about the breakdown that Russell had. But we're not going to tell them is who has immunity idols. You're going to let me go to Rob. This is good enough intel that you should move from being the  next one going home to maybe the fourth. Rob has told me we're in an alliance but I have a feeling he  told Matt the same thing. So for me I know I'm the odd man out. Is it better for me to have Kristina stay in the game?"  well, if I could pull one other person then she would be very valuable to me. <br/>Well, you have experience in these convert Matters, phil,  so whatever you think. <br/>All right, I'm going to try to get you moved up on the  list. <br/>Phil told me he was going to withhold the names of the  people until Rob took us to the merge, and then at that point reveal the  names, kind of like blackmail. The specialist thinks he's running the show, but the specialist  is just one, big windbag. So I'm just going to sit back and let him dig his own grave  right now. <br/>You guys missed a doozy today. Russell went home. And it was ugly! Russell starts crying. I mean, it was a total meltdown. <br/>He didn't say anything about idols like if he had one or anything? <br/>No, that was it. So it was really weird. <br/>So I'm gonna reveal everything that happened. <br/>I don't understand. When you said what happened that's not what happened? <br/>No. Number one, Russell got in such a meltdown he named who the  leader is over there. Who's running the show. <br/>Who's the leader? <br/>I'm going to run through the list. He named-- just listen, Rob! Let me tell the story! <br/>All right, tell the story. <br/>Okay. He started naming who had an idol. Then Russell named the two alliances. Now, do you think if I reveal all that information to you by  name you would be able to do something for Kristina? <br/>I think you should tell it to us anyway because we're in  an alliance. <br/>I know. <br/>I don't know what Kristina has to do with it. Phillip is lobbying for Kristina all of a sudden. I'm like, hey, dumb ass! Aren't you in my alliance? Don't you work for me? Now you're telling me who I should Grant favors to? Big mistake, Phillip. <br/>If you had this information in your hand, would it help  her chances? <br/>Absolutely, absolutely. <br/>You're not going to believe who's running the show? <br/>The tall girl. <br/>The one with the black hat? <br/>The black hat. <br/>And Ralph found an idol. <br/>If he felt secure, why would he ever want to keep Kristina  so Phillip knows where he's standing. This information is very helpful. What do you think? <br/>Yeah, I think it's extremely helpful. As far as Phillip goes, after this, there's no trust whatsoever  now. I don't know how long it's going to take, but this can't go on  much longer we can't trust that dude. We have to get rid of him. <br/>I know, bro, I know. <br/>What do we got? <br/>We got mail. <br/>Ready? Teamwork and ruggedness are the solutions to win. Creativity and performance are good places to begin. Sending a tribemate away is never in your plan. What you'll need today is trust in your hands. <br/>We got this one. We're building something. <br/>We got the master builder. <br/>I'm a little supersticious, and I do believe in karma. So it is so important for us to win this one, to build up  momentum. We threw that last challenge, and I hope it doesn't come back to  bite us. We have to win this today. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge. <br/>Yes. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: First things first, Kristina, I will take it back. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. On day one, both tribes were given a craftsman tool kit full of  tools. Today's challenge is going to test how adept you've become at  using those tools. On my go, you'll make your way over a balance beam where you'll  use a crow bar to open a crate. You will retrieve a shovel. You will dig to find an axe. You will the axe to chop through a rope releasing two saws. You will then saw through a wall creating planks. You'll use the planks to complete a ramp, alcohol get the entire  tribe to the top of the a platform where you must hammer three nails breaking  three tiles. First tribe to get their craftsman tool kit on top of that table  wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes! <br/>Oh! <br/>Shoot! <br/>Jeff: A barbecue set. Also provided by sears. Everything you need to barbecue, including the food. You have steak, sausage, bread, vegetables. Worth playing for. <br/>Yes! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: zapatera, you have one extra person. Going to sit somebody out in this challenge, who is it going to  be? <br/>Krista. <br/>Jeff: Krista, take a spot on the bench. Give everybody else a minute to figure out who is going to do  what and we'll get started. For reward and immunity. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, Rob, go, Rob! <br/>Jeff: It's Rob and Ralph at the first stage. <br/>Go job, Rob. <br/>Jeff: Using the crow bar. <br/>Come on Ralph! <br/>Jeff: Ralph not messing around. He's got the shovel and he's heading back. Rob has the shovel out. Julie now going to use the shovel to dig. Grant now going to use the shovel to dig for ometepe. Grant is fast and made up a lot of time. Grant tearing through that dirt. <br/>Come on, Julie. <br/>Deeper, girl, deeper! <br/>Jeff: You're looking for a hatchet. <br/>You got it, Grant, good job! <br/>Jeff: Okay, Julie has the hatchet for zapatera. <br/>Good job, Grant! Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Grant has it for ometepe. Ralph now coming out for zapatera. <br/>Let's go, Boston Rob. <br/>Jeff: Ralph attacking that log. Boston Rob now in it on. Ralph had a bit of a lead and he's using it. Ralph is really working through that log. <br/>You're almost there! <br/>Jeff: You're trying to get through that rope to release  two saws. Keep it going. Ralph has released the saws. He's headed back. Rob still working. Untie those saws. Rob not giving up. <br/>Come on Steve, keep it going. <br/>Jeff: Rob, very close. Rob's released the saws. <br/>Come on Steve and Mike! <br/>Jeff: Phillip and Grant now racing out. <br/>Come on Phillip! <br/>Jeff: Phillip and Grant trying to untie the saws. They're now in on the sign. Mike and Steve sawing for zapatera. They've got a head start. Grant and Phillip are going to have to make up some time. <br/>Work together! <br/>Let me get it. <br/>Jeff: Mike is going to take over on Steve's side. Grant and Phillip very slow on the sign. <br/>Mike and Steve making quick work of this wall. Grant and Phillip are falling behind. <br/>Yes! <br/>Come on, Phillip! <br/>Jeff: Phillip and Grant exhausted. This is not easy. Zapatera has one plank left. And he's got it. Mike and Steve headed back now. Stephanie and serena heading on the for zapatera to put the  planks into the ramp. <br/>Go, girls, go! <br/>Jeff: Phillip and Grant are on that final plank for  ometepe. You need to dig, Phillip! They have it! Ometepe is still in this. <br/>This doesn't fit! <br/>Come on, girls! Damn! <br/>Jeff: Rob and Kristina heading out for ometepe. Stephanie and serena need to hurry up. Rob and Kristina gaining ground. <br/>Not this one, next one. 3 and one. <br/>Jeff: Stephanie and serena very close. Stephanie and serena finish their planks. Rob and Kristina getting close. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>You guys, slow down. They're almost done. <br/>Go, go, go, come on! <br/>Jeff: zapatera up the plank. <br/>Good job, Rob. Good job, Kristina! <br/>Jeff: Rob and Kristina finished their planks. Everybody's got to be here. Here comes ometepe. We've got a challenge. <br/>I got it! <br/>They're right on our ass! <br/>Jeff: Everybody's got to get here, got to get on the mat. Stephanie working on the knots for zapatera. <br/>Ashley working on the knots for ometepe. <br/>Focus, shhh! <br/>Jeff: Ashley is making progress. We are neck and neck right now. <br/>Just pull out, just pull it out! <br/>Go, Ralph, go. <br/>Jeff: Stephanie has released it. Ralph will use the hammer. No pRoblem. Zapatera wins reward! And immunity. <br/>Get up on there and crow. <br/>A rooster, baby. <br/>Jeff: zapatera, immunity once again is yours. Along with a pretty decent reward. Zapatera, come get your reward. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Don't drop it! <br/>Hell, no! <br/>Jeff: All right, ometepe, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you tonight at tribal. <br/>All right, guys! About time! <br/>This is going to be a feast! <br/>Can you smell the pepper? Smell. <br/>This victory truly was exponential. I have never been this hungry in my life. I haven't thought about sex in two weeks. All I'm thinking about is food. <br/>Let's just start cooking. <br/>It was awesome. We had red meat and some kind of sausage link, bell peppers. It tasted great. I sucked stuff out of my fingernails that haven't been cleaned  since I got here. <br/>We are the stronger team. <br/>We are the stronger team. <br/>There is definitely a good mood rolling through the camp. I definitely don't wish ill upon the other tribe, but I'm really  glad we're not sitting in their shoes now trying to figure out what to do  about tribal council tonight. <br/>So, how about a brief tribal meeting real quickly here? I know we're all feeling a little down right now. We would have liked to have won. That said, I thought we did pretty good overall. You know, we all put forth a great effort. Okay. Anybody got anything? Okay. Let's get to it. <br/>Man, we can't win a challenge. It's tough already, and Phillip, he's never one to shy away from  a moment in the sun. I mean, at this point, there's, like, an utter malice towards  him. That's palpable. <br/>Are you getting ready to pour it. <br/>Yeah, we're going to pour it. <br/>Do you want me to do it? <br/>Nope , I got it. <br/>I got to see this. Just be very careful. Move away. Like your feet--  Phillip, I cannot stand him. Like, can't even look at him. That's highway bad I can't stand him. And I think we're all on the same page. But, you know, we've got to go to tribal tonight so we might as  well make the best of it. I just hope Phillip goes home! <br/>Get your ass up here. <br/>When I come back from a loss, the very last thing that I  really want to have to endure is Phillip's yammering. Going to tribal council tonight I'm thinking it's myself or Phillip  going home. I'm on the wrong side of the numbers in this tribe. I have been since day one. At the same time, they might vote for Phillip because he does  annoy everybody. So I think I have a good chance, but if I had the idol in my  pocket, I'd feel better. <br/>When we won the reward, there must have been a clue. I'd be surprised if they haven't found it. <br/>What makes you so sure? <br/>You. <br/>Kristina is kind of acting weird. She's not frantically searching for the idol, which is very  strange. Could mean that she has it. Could mean that she doesn't. I don't know. She goes, "Well, I guess the idol's in play now gain."  and I'm like, "What makes you think that?" and she's like,  "Well, somebody must have found the clue."  Oh, she thinks one of us found it? <br/>She thinks we have the idol. Or she does have it. Dude, this is so tricky. <br/>Exactly. <br/>Like I can't figure it out. Apparently Kristina has been snooping around about the idol. She's dangerous. As much as everybody hates Phillip he's less of a threat to me  than Kristina is. This is what I think. We send her ass home. Why take a chance? Just split. I don't want to give it away that I have the idol. I want them to think Kristina has it so we're going to split the  votes. We're going to throw three votes on christine, two votes on Phillip  and if everybody does what they're told, Kristina will be voted out. <br/>With Phillip, it's just more stressful. Having him around. <br/>He's a pain in the ass. He's a hazard, man. <br/>He's a ticking timed bomb. <br/>Yeah. <br/>That's what scares me. <br/>The plan is at tribal council tonight to get rid of Kristina,  but I think it's a mistake. Phillip is just a loose cannon. You don't know what he's going to do. I don't trust him, dude. <br/>I don't, either. <br/>The sooner we get rid of--  I just wonder-- like, who knows how to play the game  better? <br/>I'm telling you, I would feel a lot better for all of us  if we were gone. We can deal with Kristina, I think? <br/>Can we? Kristina's no slouch, man. Grant, he wants to get rid of Phillip tonight, and those girls  are obsessed with getting Phillip out. So it quite conceivably could be that somebody within my  alliance might be willing to flip and vote out Phillip. Honestly, as long Ashley stays on board and Grant stays on board  then we have nothing to fear. Hopefully, all these guys get nice in line like they should and  do as they're told. If not, I'm not in control of my tribe after all. <br/>So I just wanna know what am I doing tonight? <br/>I think it's pretty obvious. We're all voting for Kristina. <br/>Okay. <br/>Sure enough, Rob wants to vote Kristina. Clearly, he's not a man of his word. So I need to take control of my own fate and at tribal council  be ready to make the moves you need to make to survive. <br/>I'm ready to go. <br/>Because who knows? I could be the real target. Anything can happen in the game of "Survivor."  Jeff: Kristina, both times that you guys have been here to  tribal council, you've been on the hot seat. Feel that again tonight? <br/>Sure, absolutely. <br/>Jeff: what's happening that's always got you in trouble? <br/>I mean, I felt like I started off on the wrong side of the  numbers. But I'm a fighter, and I don't give up, and I'm determined. I'll keep trying, you know. I want to stay. <br/>Jeff: Natalie, how do you feel about second chances? <br/>I think second chances are great. I think Kristina's a really nice person, you know. Just have to see. <br/>Jeff: Grant, can people change in this game? <br/>Yeah. I mean, of course. Everybody here is pretty laid back andaise to get along with, so  you can definitely get a second chance. <br/>But, to be fair, I think, Kristina really just joined this  tribe. For the first eight days we were out here, I don't think she  really, like, was a part of us. The real question is, is it too late? Or are people willing to give her a shot? <br/>Jeff: Kristina, what do you think the tribe should do  tonight? <br/>I think the tribe should vote out who they consider to be  the weakest link in this tribe. <br/>Jeff: And how do you define "Weak?"  I think weak in this case might be disruptiveness. <br/>Jeff: who qualifies as being disruptive? <br/>Oh, I think phil's a little disruptive. I think he's a little assertive, and I think it's uncomfortable  for some people at times. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, is that something you've faced in life  before, being a little disruptive? <br/>No, I wouldn't characterize it as that at all. I'm actually a doer. And I'm one of those people that if you're not about pulling  your share and you show up right at meal time, I pRobably am a little  disruptive to them. <br/>Jeff: he threw it right back at you, Kristina. <br/>That's what he does. I do a lot of stuff around camp too, just about as much as you  do, phil. <br/>I would beg to differ. <br/>Anyway, I do a lot of stuff, too. <br/>The last three days you have, yes. <br/>Jeff: So Phillip, clearly, you think it should be Kristina  tonight. Kristina, you clearly think it should be Phillip. <br/>Well, if me I have a history with the tribe. They know what I'm about. <br/>Jeff: You're a doer. <br/>It's what I call the sheppard stamp. And the sheppard stamp is being one of 12, having my mother pass  at a very early age, and having to work my way through high school, deciding  I was going to join the united states army and getting an honorable  discharge, receiving the second highest medal you can get during peace time,  doing what, field sanitation? What a glorious job. But I did it to the best of my ability. And that's what these guys see out here every single day. So I think between Kristina and I, I think I've earned the  respect of my tribe. <br/>Jeff: All right, Kristina, he laid out a very compelling  argument why the tribe should keep him. Before we go to the vote, your last chance. <br/>I don't think I had a chance at the very beginning to get  to know everyone but I'm a valuable member of this tribe. I'm smart, and I can be trusted in this tribe, and I want to  prove that to them. If they'll give me that opportunity, I can do that. <br/>Jeff: we're going to find out. It is time to vote. Natalie, you're up. <br/>Kristina, time has run out. <br/>Phil, you're a pain in the neck. I really hope it's you and not me. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now would be the time to do so. All right, once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Phillip. Kristina. Phillip. Two votes Phillip. Kristina. We're tied. Two votes Phillip, two votes Kristina. Phillip. That's three votes Phillip, two votes Kristina. Kristina. We're tied. Three votes Phillip, three votes Kristina, one vote left. Fourth person voted out of "Survivor: Redemption Island."  Kristina. You need to bring me your torch. Kristina, the tribe has spoken. You need to bring me your torch. Kristina, the tribe has spoken. You will have a shot to get back in this game. Grab your torch. Head to Redemption Island. Well, running out of time was clearly a theme in tonight's  tribal council, and if you don't start winning, time is going to run out for  this tribe. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff:next time on "Survivor":  You got your underwear on? <br/>I have my underwear on. <br/>Jeff: Shifting alliances creates strange bedfellows. <br/>Phillip is bugging everyone. So maybe he needs to stay. <br/>Jeff: And at zapatera Russell taught his girls well. <br/>We're ready cause some havoc and chaos. <br/>Jeff: So tribe unity crumbles. <br/>David is stressful. <br/>Don't freak out. <br/>They just got my rear end raked across the coals at tribal  council. I'm not surprised. I mean, you can't be surprised being voted off of  "Survivor" but it's a whole new ballgame now. I'm going to have to face off with Matt and do the best I can  and get out there and give it all I have and just rock it. That's what my strategy is right now.
