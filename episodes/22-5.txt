<br/>Episode 5 -  <br/>Jeff: previously on "Survivor": By day 10, the  two big dogs, Russell hantz and Boston Rob, were running in opposite  directions. Rob found a hidden immunity idol. <br/>Ding, ding. This is the real deal. This is not a phony baloney. <br/>Jeff: And even though they had lost three out of four  challenges, he held blind aliegence over everyone on the Ometepe tribe except  for Kristina and Phillip. <br/>I need to get rid of him now. Good-bye, Rob. <br/>Jeff: Russell could only muster loyalty from two on his tribe,  Krista and Stephanie. And he couldn't even come close to finding an idol. <br/>Where is the idol? <br/>Jeff: The rest of the Zapatera tribe was so down on Russell,  they agreed to throw a challenge so they could send him to Redemption Island,  where he faced Matt in a duel. Matt stays alive! Matt not only defeated Russell, he reduced him to tears. Suddenly, Russell was out for good. <br/>This is my last time playing this game. <br/>Jeff: At the last tribal council-- Kristina, both times  that you guys have been here to tribal council, you've been on the hot seat? Rob's position just kept getting better when he got his tribe to  vote out his biggest opposition. Kristina, the tribe has spoken. Now Kristina heads to Redemption Island where he will face Matt  in a duel to see who will stay alive. Grab your torches, head back to camp. <br/>This is wicked, man. <br/>Is the blanket dry? <br/>Yeah, it was right at the tip. Without the tarp, that would have been wet. <br/>Take as much wet clothes as you can off. <br/>Thank you, tarp. <br/>Tonight, Kristina went home after a 4-3 vote, three for  me, four for her. Not too surprising. I suspected it. There was a very close alliance with Rob and several others in  the group. They've been running the show from the get-go. And I'm kind of like the odd man out around here, even though I  think I bring a lot to this tribe, and soon a couple of people are going to  vato wake up and realize that. <br/>Ready for bed? <br/>Can we move down a little bit that way? You and I are going to be really good buddies tonight. <br/>You got your underwear on? <br/>I have my underwear on, but that doesn't stop me, brother. <br/>Phillip last night stuck his leg in my back, like his  knee, into my back. Just to be an ass last night. <br/>Do you think he's a little upset about tribal council? <br/>I don't know. Tribal council is always a miserable night all around. On top of it, Phillip is bugging everyone, including myself. He's completely off his rocker, walking around in those pink  panties. Nobody trusts him. <br/>It's seriously hurting my eyes. <br/>As long as Phillip is aggravating everybody so much it  takes all of the heat off of me, so in a way, maybe he needs to stay. <br/>Day 12-- the spirits of the tribe are high, you know, as  long as we keep excelling in the challenges. Everything is kind of coming along as planned. <br/>You got a fish! <br/>Thank you. <br/>Our six is rock-solid, and my vision would be to try to  reach out to those two girls. There's always hope to bring Krista and Stephanie in. <br/>The fish is out there. <br/>Go for it. <br/>If we can show them that we're a solid family and there's  no backstabbing and it's a safe place to be--  Oh, my god, that's the best-tasting one. I'm not kidding you. <br/>I would think that they would want to hang tight with us  going into a merge. <br/>Got some tree mail. The reading of the scroll. "Another duel is happening at the arena. Of course, you know the score. It doesn't Matter how you choose them. It's time to send two more." so who hasn't been? You two, me, and Julie. <br/>Who's it going to be? <br/>Whoever picks one and four? <br/>One and four or two and three. Don't Matter. <br/>So one and four. <br/>Go ahead, you two. <br/>One. <br/>Quick decision. <br/>I'm just ready to go. Four. <br/>All right. <br/>Yay! <br/>[laughs]  Sorry, didn't mean to hit you. <br/>Now that Russell is gone, Stephanie and Krista, they're  not even a threat. They can go do whatever they want. They can talk about whatever they want. We really don't care. They're-- they're just pawns in this big game. <br/>See you in a couple of hours. <br/>Have fun. <br/>We will. <br/>They can't do any damage to us. <br/>What all are we going to tell them? <br/>Hey, can you tell Rob that we're Russell's girls and we  hate our tribe? I'm hoping to send the other tribe a message that they have two  girls ready to flip so we're ready to cause some havoc and chaos and  craziness at the merge! <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the competitors for today's duel. Matt will battle against Kristina, voted out at the last tribal  council. Welcome to Redemption Island arena. Both tribes sent two members to witness today's duel. Rob and Grant from Ometepe. Krista and Stephanie from Zapatera. Matt, you have won both duels you've been in. Kristina, this is your first. It is a do-or-die situation. In order to continue your quest for the million dollars, you have  to win. Loser goes home. Here it is. On my go, you'll race to collect puzzle pieces. Once you have all the pieces, you will use them to complete a  puzzle in the shape of a cube. First person to get it right stays alive in this game. Loser is out for good. This is it, one shot. Take your spots. Winner stays, loser goes home. Survivors ready? Go. It's a very simple challenge. It's a 3 x 3 cube you are trying to put together. The pattern will be on the outside. You've got to get all the cubes up here, then you start working  on it. As in the case of every duel, this is potentially a  million-dollar challenge. Matt has all his pieces. He's starting to work on the puzzle. Kristina now has all of hers. These pieces are not light. Kristina making some progress right out of the gate. Matt making some progress. Matt looking good from this angle. Thinks he may be getting closer. Very close but wrong. Matt starting over completely. One moment Kristina's on the verge of passing out, the next  moment she's knocking pieces off the puzzle like a true gladiator. Boston Rob and Grant watching. <br/>You rascal. You voted me out for no reason. I still don't know why. If you want to explain to me why, while I'm working, it might  calm me down or something. <br/>Jeff: why did you vote him out, Rob? <br/>Doesn't take one person to vote someone out, Jeff. You know that. <br/>Jeff: Kristina starting again now. Got some new energy, like maybe she has a new idea. <br/>It goes on top. <br/>Jeff: Matt just clued into something that seems to be  helping him. Kristina not giving up. Using every bit of energy she has. And Matt thinks he may be getting closer. <br/>Got it! <br/>Jeff: Matt thinks he has it. Out of nowhere. Matt stays alive! <br/>I told you. [ applause ]  Jeff: Matt, congratulations. You're still in this game. A lot going on at the end of that challenge. As you are talking to Rob and Grant about why they voted you  out, did you learn anything? <br/>I mean, like, I told both of those guys that I wanted to  go with them to the top three. I mean, like, I wanted you two guys, man. So hopefully I'll hop back up on the Ometepe tribe. <br/>I kind of like that he says he would stick to his tribe. I wish I felt the same he did. There's still a clear division. <br/>Jeff: In your tribe? <br/>In our tribe. Us two together on the bottom. <br/>They may think they have the numbers, but I think yellow  might look good on me. <br/>Me, too. <br/>Jeff: wow. Rob, Grant, that never hurts to have two people say,  "Listen, we might be willing to merge with you."  Doesn't hurt if they're telling the truth. <br/>I'm telling the truth. <br/>Jeff: Kristina... You don't want to hear it. Your shot at redemption is over. [ applause ] put your buff in the urn on your way out. <br/>Do I have to? <br/>Jeff: You got to. Matt, for the third time, you have seized the moment, and your  quest for the million dollars and a chance to get even or rejoin continues. Grab your stuff. Head back to Redemption Island and await your next opponent. You guys can head out. <br/>I didn't even plant a seed in Rob's head. It's more like I took a sequoia tree and put it in his brain. This is the only thing I have to hold on to to stay in this  game. <br/>I hate rice. <br/>I really don't eat rice at home or anything. It's like 90 seconds to put in the microwave, brown rice. <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah. It's the easiest thing ever. <br/>Like peas and corn and everything. I used to do that in college. <br/>Rob and Grant stepped away to go watch the duel at Redemption  Island, so kind of funny kind of day for me. For me, it's just, like, I can't make an impression on these  ladies so it's frustrating for me. These girls remind me of crabs, to be honest, back at camp, you  know, particularly Natalie and Ashley. I have a very difficult time trying to approach them. They're quick to move away. They see me coming. And they don't want to have a conversation with me about it. They definitely remind me of crabs. Andrea is a little bit more approachable, but she's cautious. She doesn't want Rob or Grant to know that she's talking to me,  even though they're the ones who sent her closeet ally, Matt, to Redemption  Island. <br/>It's just all wet. <br/>It's going to be okay. <br/>It's looking good. <br/>Bravo. <br/>I've already got a whole bed of them underneath here that  are going to ignite. It's going to settle and then start that to burn as well. <br/>That was the ticket. <br/>We miss the boys. Like, Rob and Grant are like our big brothers. Like, it's weird not having them around, and so we had to fake  it to make Phillip feel part of the group. We had to fake it so Andrea feels comfortable. There's a lot of faking going on, but that's the name of the  game. <br/>The sun's coming out, girls. Almost time for our beach day. <br/>My relationship with the girls is-- is just-- there is a  level of frustration that's growing a little bit because they-- they just  don't do that much. <br/>Oh, my gosh, that feels so good. <br/>I know. <br/>It's a little agitating to me because I want to keep, you  know, getting stuff done and keep going but I also kind of have to hang out  with them because I feel like us three girls are together. They're sweet girls but the conversations usually going to  superficial stuff like, "Oh, how's my hair," talking about stuff  like that. <br/>What happened to your back? What is that? <br/>It's me picking my skin. <br/>Oh, my god. Stop. <br/>It only looks bad right now because it's, like, wet. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>That's my habit. <br/>What's up, girls? <br/>Right now, everyone feels safe and oh, we have our five,  we have our five. But I mean, if I had it my way I would want to get rid of Natalie  and Ashley before Phillip but I can't really bring that up without putting  myself on the chopping block. <br/>You went to them. You got a good shot. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I like you a lot. I think you're the best female worker here. <br/>I appreciate that. Like, it's a little frustrating to be here when there's, like  stuff always to be done. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You still have to play the social game so you can't just  be doing work the entire time. You have to socialize, too. <br/>Look at me. I'm stuck. I mean, I feel frustrated in this game because I haven't  connected with any of you, the younger ladies. You've, I've come a tiny bit having conversations with, but the  other two, they can't engage me. <br/>I can ask you something? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Honestly? <br/>Yeah. <br/>There hasn't been any point in this game whatsoever that  you tried to throw me under the bus or do anything against me. <br/>Never? <br/>Never. <br/>Never? <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. I wasn't, like suspicious. But it's hard to trust anyone out here. <br/>Only Rob and Grant-- you guys are pulling all the strings. I sleep by myself. Nobody cuddles up with me and have that little chat, chat, chat,  right? <br/>Little what? Chat, chat, chat, chat? <br/>Whatever you guys talk about. I'm sure you and Matt--  Matt's long gone. <br/>I know, but at one point you talked about the game, the  strategy, whatever. I've never been able to do that with anyone here. If Matt comes back-- I'm going to put this out to you-- you, me,  and Matt being an alliance. I don't like Rob backstabbing Matt. And I'm just waiting for my time. And that's what's frustrating for me. They don't realize this guy has a history of throwing people  under the bus when it suits his needs. I mean, some real synergy with Andrea today. And I think that maybe in the future, that will hold something  both for she as well as for I. <br/>Well? <br/>Kristina won! <br/>No! <br/>No, I'm just kidding. <br/>Oh, my gosh, don't do that! <br/>To fully understand my relationship with Rob is the king  is a dictator, and I'm a lord, and I'm waiting for my opportunity to replace  the king. <br/>I don't want to go back. <br/>I don't, either. That was like heaven. <br/>Redemption island is beautiful because we got to speak and  Rob heard us loud and clear unless for some reason he lost his hearing  because as he was leaving, he told us to hang on. And that's what we're going to do. We're gonna hang on. <br/>What all are we going to tell them? <br/>I say everything that we can tell them except the point  where we offered Rob our two votes. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And I think Rob kind of feels like his head is on the line  here because our team got rid of Russell so quickly, you know, for no reason. <br/>I know. <br/>I mean, they have to notice the division. So, basically, if we keep winning he'll know add two, add two, Rob. Whatever you think your numbers are right now you better add two  because we are totally with you. Okay, I'm a little excited. Take it day by day, day by day. We just need to keep winning the challenges. <br/>Yeah. Okay. <br/>This is our best thing right now and hopefully things go  our way. That's the only thing I can hold on to right now because my head  is on the chopping block and I don't want my head to go a-rolling. <br/>Put the team above yourself, you know, out here. Every team thing I ever played was always a success. Like they say, there's no "I" in team. <br/>Since Russell has left, there has been zero talk of  strategy. <br/>It's got to be getting ugly at the other camp. <br/>It's got to be really ugly. <br/>One more defeat will be a backbreaker. <br/>Everything has been, "How awesome we did at the  challenge." "No, it was you." that's all they're talking  about. They don't play the game and when the game makes them play it,  they're going to be very disappointed. <br/>Would you like fresh tortillas today, sir? <br/>To avoid hanging out with the tribe, exclude yourself by  making the meal. Then you won't have to put up with the boring stories you've  already heard 95 times. <br/>Krista and Stephanie, they're kind of on the outskirts of  our tribe. <br/>Anybody have any water to spare? <br/>I know that they're definitely conspiring together. I mean, they were part of Russell's alliance, and they've  remained pretty tight from there. So there definitely are some risks, but I don't see it playing  into the game too much at this point. <br/>We're going to go hard. <br/>Hard, guys. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>There's only victory today, guys. <br/>Yup. <br/>Only victory. <br/>One choice. <br/>Well, I'm back, man. My strength is back. <br/>The head band goes on, game time. We've got to win today. <br/>I feel like the tribe is a little over-confident right  now, and there's reason for it, but we threw that challenge, and I hope it  doesn't come back to bite us. You know, once you start winning you get on a roll, and to stop  that roll, I'm a little superstitious when it comes to that so I wanty  everybody to keep things in check, you know, until we actually win, then we  can be cocky or whatever, but right now, it's kind of bad karma. <br/>Steam, steam, steam, steam! <br/>You just put the fire out! <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes! <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Jeff: First things first, give it up, David. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, one person on each tribe will be your  caller. The other tribemates will be blindfolded. Using only verbal commands, the caller must guide their tribemates  through a maze to collect bags of puzzle pieces. Once you've collected all four, the caller will then use those  pieces to solve a word phrase. First tribe to get it right wins immunity, safe from the vote. Losers go to tribal council where somebody will be voted out of  this game and sent to Redemption Island. In addition, you're playing for a reward. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: Everything you need to make coffee-- sugar, cream,  and honey. And, clearly, you have a basketful of pastries. <br/>I could eat the basket. <br/>Jeff: Zapatera, you have two extra members, sitting two  people out this challenge. Who's it going to be? Steve and Julie going to sit this one out. Take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. <br/>Who's calling? Who's calling? <br/>I'm calling. <br/>If you are calling out the directions, you are also being  the puzzle maker and Stephanie is good. She is a linguist, you can tell. I knew she was going to be great at calling things out. She's bossy as all get-out, so that was definitely the job for  her. <br/>Wait. <br/>Go through the puzzle sequence again. <br/>Three, five, five, two, seven. <br/>Look for the first word to be "The." I'm not god  gift's to the puzzle world but I'm more qualified to be doing a word puzzle  than Stephanie. Serita is trying to be too fair. Let everybody have a chance, everybody play. This isn't like a peewee soccer league. <br/>I'm go to direct Grant. Everybody will follow him. <br/>I'm good at puzzles. <br/>This could be a turning point for this tribe. There's no way they can take this win away from us. <br/>Jeff: All right, Stephanie is the caller for Zapatera. Boston Rob is the caller for Ometepe. They will also be responsible for solving the word phrase at the  end. For immunity and reward, survivors ready? Go. <br/>Straight ahead, keep going, straight, straight, straight. <br/>Straight, straight, keep going. Hang on to Ralph, guys. <br/>Straight, straight. <br/>Straight. <br/>Go straight, Ralph. <br/>Come on, come on, get ahold of my hand. <br/>Grant, go, go, go. Left, Grant. <br/>The bag is right there. Untie it! <br/>Jeff: Mike has a bag for Zapatera. <br/>Left, left, left, Grant. Grant, left. Right there. There it is. <br/>Jeff: Grant has a bag for Ometepe. <br/>Ashley, go straight. <br/>Hands down serita. To the right. That's your bag. <br/>Jeff: Serita has a bag for Zapatera. <br/>Move to your left. <br/>Jeff: Krista has a bag for Zapatera. <br/>Right there, Grant, turn around. Right there, that's it. <br/>Jeff: Grant has the first bag on the table for Ometepe. <br/>Right there. <br/>Jeff: Ashley has a bag. <br/>Stephanie. <br/>Serita stop, turn around, go straight. <br/>Where do I need to go? <br/>Ralph, wait. Other people. Turn, turn, turn, perfect. Leave the bags in there. <br/>Hey, ain't nothing there! <br/>Ralph, stop talking! <br/>Jeff: Serita and Krista have the first two bags for Zapatera. <br/>Go forward, forward. Stop! Make a left. <br/>Ashley, make a left and go straight. Grant, stop. Put your hand to the right. <br/>Jeff: Grant with another bag for Ometepe. <br/>Serita, lead him into the box you were just in. <br/>Jeff: Mike has a third bag back to their table. <br/>Keep going, Ashley, right there, put it down. <br/>Jeff: Ashley has the second bag for Ometepe on the table. <br/>Stephanie, is there anything over here? <br/>Stephanie, where do I need to go? <br/>Ralph, stop and wait until I address you. <br/>Yeah, Grant, you got it, straight through, straight to the  end. <br/>Jeff: Ometepe has three bags. Both tribes have one bag left. <br/>Ralph, your turn. Are you listening? Move to your left. No! Your other left! Straight, stop! Straight, go forward, Ralph. <br/>Forwards? <br/>There it is, right in front of you. <br/>Jeff: Grant has the fourth and final bag for Ometepe. <br/>Where is the last bag? <br/>Ralph, right in front of you, on that hook. Grab that bag! Open it! <br/>Jeff: Zapatera with their fourth bag. <br/>Keep going, Grant, you got it. <br/>Jeff: Rob can now head out and start working on the  puzzle. <br/>Straight, straight, go forward. Right here, right here. <br/>Come on, Rob, come on, Rob! <br/>Put on the table. Put it on the table. Put it on the table. <br/>We're there, go! <br/>Jeff: Go, Stephanie. Stephanie now working on the puzzle for Zapatera. <br/>Come on, Rob! <br/>Jeff: A huge time advantage for Ometepe and one of the  best puzzle solvers in Boston Rob. <br/>Go, stef, you got it. <br/>Jeff: It is a showdown, now. Boston Rob and Stephanie. Both callers volunteered for this job. Both felt confident. <br/>Come on, you got it! <br/>Jeff: Stephanie, opening her last bag. <br/>Come on, stef! <br/>Jeff: Rob opening his last bag of puzzle pieces. Stephanie's got all of hers open. Stephanie now back in the lead time-wise. She is not messing around. <br/>She's got it. I'm not even worried about her. <br/>Come on, Stephanie, you got it, you got it. <br/>Open 'em up! Hustle! <br/>Jeff: This is a hero or a goat role. When you put yourself as the caller and puzzle solver you better  be right. Immunity and a huge reward. Stephanie made up a lot of time when it came to opening these  bags of pieces. Rob just discovered he's got a missing piece. That will make it easier. <br/>Good job, Rob. <br/>Jeff: A lot of experimenting going on. So many different word possibilities. <br/>Let's go, buddy. There you go. <br/>He's got something. <br/>Jeff: Both Stephanie and Rob think they have a little  something at the end. Is it the right word? <br/>You got it, stef. <br/>Shut up. <br/>Jeff: Rob thinks he has something going now. <br/>You got it, Rob, here we go. <br/>Come on, Stephanie. <br/>I wish David had been calling. I don't think she's smart enough for this. <br/>Good job, Rob. <br/>Come on, Stephanie. <br/>Jeff: Rob moving some pieces around again. <br/>That's why we needed David. <br/>Jeff: Rob thinks he has it. He does! Ometepe wins reward and immunity. <br/>Awesome, dude! Awesome! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Should have had you do that puzzle. <br/>Yep, dave should have been there. <br/>Jeff: Ometepe, congratulations. [ applause ]  Yay! <br/>Jeff: All right, Ometepe come grab your reward. Head back to camp and enjoy the night off. <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>Oh, my god, the smell, you guys! <br/>Look at that. <br/>Jeff: Zapatera, tribal council tonight. Somebody will be voted out of your tribe and sent to Redemption  Island where they will have to duel to stay in this game. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I'll see you at tribal. <br/>Well, even though we lost today in the challenge we really  won. This is going to be between Krista and Stephanie. Those two are on the chopping block tonight. <br/>Mmm! <br/>Mmm! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Yummy! <br/>How can you not smile when you eat these? <br/>This is so good. <br/>Oh, my gosh, the chocolate donuts! I can't even choose a favorite. Like, I love muffins. Those muffins, it was, like, apple cinnamon or something. It was so good. <br/>Yummy to victory! We got a win today. You get to see my beautiful whites more often. I love what sugar does. You see. <br/>I know. Sugar is nice. <br/>For a massage, I'd give up half a donut. <br/>Oh, yeah, Phillip was like, "I'll trade a donut if  somebody gives me a massage." I was like I wouldn't give you a massage  for a dozen donuts, buddy. <br/>That is coffee! Smell that. <br/>Sure enough, I pick up the coffee, you know, after eating,  everyone is distracted by the food, I swirl it around a little bit and give  it a smell, and as I'm smelling I see what looks like to be a little roll of  paper. Sure enough, Rob saw the same thing. How do you do? You got all your tribe around, looking. But nobody caught it, I don't think. <br/>Do you guys want to save the croissants for tomorrow? <br/>That sounds great. <br/>Does that sound good? <br/>Grant set a block for me. I was going to put it down my pants but if I do that, it's too  obvious I have it on me. I was like how can I get this whole thing over there so I can  make him come back to the camp. When Grant turned the other way he set a pick for me and I went  around the outside. It was like a well-choreographed football play. <br/>Hand it to me. <br/>I'll bring it back to camp. I'll hide this. <br/>Yummy. <br/>Aren't those great? <br/>Smell this, dude! This is the darkest--  Now that's real coffee. <br/>That's real coffee, right? <br/>I'm going to go switch this with the clue that I already  have. And give 'em the first clue and keep this one. So we gotta move. Today's a good day. What can I say? Not only did we win immunity and reward, but I got very lucky  and had someone hand me the clue to the hidden immunity idol and I just went  to go hide it for him. Unbeknownst to Grant, I ran to my stash and my original hidden  immunity idol clue they had buried, swapped them out and put the original  clue in my hand in place of the one that he thinks that we took out of the  coffee. That first clue is so ridiculous. It says something about, like, looking in the sand and under a  rock or maybe in a tree, dig for it, climb for it. Who knows? There's no way they're finding anything with it. Dude, it doesn't say crap. <br/>Did you find it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>No, the idol. <br/>Hold on. Um...  Do you want to just bury it? <br/>Let's think. Think, think, think. <br/>Do you want to put it where the shovels are? Dig a hole with the shovels. <br/>And bury it. <br/>Let's go. <br/>When Grant first came up to me I wasn't sure if he had saw  me in the other woods so I had to, like, you know, pretend like I was  nervous. Okay, nobody will know. <br/>This tree right here. <br/>This is really all for nothing because I already have the  immunity idol, but it's fun for me. I have to entertain myself out here somehow. I had to hustle, you know, but you gotta hustle if you want to  make a dollar. Everybody knows that. <br/>This is the puzzle guy, hands down. I think she tried her best and I commend her for it. <br/>She did a great job. She did a great job. <br/>That just wasn't her position. <br/>I think in her defense because David is the puzzle guy, David  under pressure is really stressful. <br/>You're freaking wrong there. Don't go there with that. Me under pressure may not be the way you--  I'm just giving you my opinion. <br/>Let me speak. Me under pressure may not be the way you want it to be handled,  I don't freak out. I do very well under pressure. My entire life is based on being under pressure. <br/>I'm just saying--  It just doesn't jibe well with your personality maybe. <br/>I'm just saying my perspective on her, normally I would  have defaulted to you--  The puzzle Matters, not the maze. <br/>Then I think maybe in the future...  I'm the one doing puzzles from here on out, no question. <br/>It's absurd for serita to go with her decision that Stephanie  thinks she's the right person. Everybody knows we have a very strong attorney. He lives with doing puzzles. That's his thing. I'm more disappointed in the whole team than at Stephanie. For a couple of strong personalities not to step up. <br/>Here's the pRoblem-- we're one ahead at this point. We need to string a couple of victories together. We need to be really, really smart about who we put where. This was just a personnel pRoblem. <br/>It was. <br/>That's totally true. <br/>Stephanie and Krista made their bed on day one, literally  and metaphorically, right next to Russell. So I don't see either of them as someone I can trust. You know, with Stephanie's floundering today at the puzzle, I  might put her as on the chopping block number one. <br/>So what do you think? Do you think Stephanie can come around or do you think she's  just kind of playing? <br/>No, I don't trust her one bit. <br/>I don't want to give up hopes on Stephanie. I want to keep working on her but Krista I don't even want to  waste my breath. I don't like her. I'm hoping we can still reel Stephanie in. They both have targets, but Krista has the bull's eye on her. <br/>Her and Krista and David are the people they just-- even  as much as I want to try to trust David. <br/>Yeah. <br/>He is a lawyer at his very core. He is so out for himself. <br/>If it was entirely up to me, David would be going home  tonight but Stephanie and Krista, they played their hands so early on, so now  it's kind of they are two dead ducks sitting on a lake waiting for the  gunshots. <br/>Well, I believe there is a will and a plan, and if that's  for one of us tonight, if there's nothing we can do about it, then all we  have to do is just continue to fight on Redemption Island and continue to  fight here. Because they're not playing the game. So eventually this is all going to come back and bite them in  the end. The sad thing is there's-- there's really no scrambling for Stephanie  and I to do. It's either me or Stephanie going home. They're so locked tight in their comfort of "Let's just get  through this one and then we know we're safe." no more thinking past the  fact that what happens if after this vote, everyone makes it to the merge? They're not thinking about that. And who is going to stick around in the end and who would you  want to be sitting next to when the votes come down? If I had to put money on it, I would say that none of them are  going to make it to the end. I just wish I was going to be around to see it. <br/>Jeff: Krista, at the last tribal council, Russell was  voted out. You and Stephanie were pretty vocal about the fact that it was  the three of you in one alliance. Everybody else was in another alliance. Is that still the case? <br/>That's still the case. And after Russell left, there's really been no game playing. It kind of seems like the brady bunch has gone camping and  they've invited the two neglected stepchildren to come along. <br/>Jeff: Serita, what do you think Krista means when she says  you're not playing the game? <br/>I just think it's so funny because we've been playing it  so fast and furiously that we unseated one of the best players in  "Survivor" history and we want to stick and see if we can take that  all the way. <br/>Playing the game means you don't stick with six through  the entire game; you eventually come down to five then four, then three, then  two, and then they're going to have to play. You know, I'm not here to sit around a campfire and make friends. I'm here to play the game. <br/>You really haven't played any strategic game because you  haven't had those conversations. You haven't reached out to people. You haven't developed that trust. You've been abrasive this entire time to everybody. That was your strategy. <br/>What am I supposed to say? "Hey, I got a great idea, let's vote off Stephanie."  How about you talk to someone and form a bond and  establish some trust. That's strategy. <br/>Jeff: Krista, you're saying, fine, you've got me or Stephanie  tonight but then there are six of you. You're implying there is no suballiances in this group. <br/>I think if there are any, it's in pairs. You obviously have Mike and Steve who have been tight from the  beginning. And then I think Julie has become comfortable with Steve. And then you have serita and Ralph. They seem to be together. I don't know where that leaves dave. But seems to be twos. So with me and Stephanie here, which could be a big four, if I  was in that six, I would be jumping on one of us. <br/>Jeff: Mike, the tradeoff for being so clear about who you  want to vote out is they now come to tribal with both barrels loaded. Krista just outed a whole lot. <br/>You're right, Jeff. There's no protecting it at this point. However, what she doesn't know is amongst our six there has been  lots of talk of strategy and she has been the odd man out so she hasn't seen  any of that. <br/>Jeff: Stephen, in one way, it's easy. You've narrowed it down to Krista or Stephanie and now you have  to figure out who are we going to keep to help us in the next challenge. <br/>Well, I would have preferred somebody else making the  calls today. I wasn't able to say anything but I would have thrown down to  have David make the call and do the puzzle. <br/>Jeff: So, Stephanie, would it be fair for the tribe to say  we gave you the money spot. You didn't come through. You're the one that should go home? <br/>I just have to rely on my record with them. Hopefully, I did my best in every other challenge. And I know I have. I just have to make sure that they realize that. <br/>Jeff: Krista, did you and Stephanie talk about the idea  today that it was one of the two of you going? <br/>It just becomes a reality that, you know, it could be me. It could be her. But, you know, it's just who's going to be first. <br/>But we still have Redemption Island so we have to keep the  faith in each other alive because we have nothing else to hold on to. <br/>Jeff: well, based on what we've heard tonight, Krista or Stephanie,  it appears one of you is about to be sent to Redemption Island. Let's find out who it is going to be. It is time to vote. Julie, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Steve. Steve. Two votes Steve. Krista. Krista. Krista. Three votes Krista, two votes Steve. Krista. That's four votes Krista, two votes Steve. Fifth person voted out of "Survivor: Redemption Island, Krista. <br/>Jeff: Krista, the tribe has spoken. You will have a chance to get back in this game. Grab your torch. Head to Redemption Island. Well, the good news is, tonight, you had an easy vote. The bad news-- Krista didn't go quietly. The question is what kind of damage did she do to the alliances  within this tribe? Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor": At Redemption  Island, Matt's winning streak is in trouble. Matt, you need to get that bag open. <br/>I'm working on it, PRobst. <br/>Jeff: And a girls' spa day. <br/>If you can make yourself be more comfortable, why not? <br/>Jeff: Causes a Phillip sheppard melt down. <br/>This is not a pageant. Get off your butts and help out around here. I'm the red-headed stepchild. <br/>Walking in... I'm not going to lie. It's a really scary, lonely feeling. But I have a light and a strength within me that not anybody can  take away. It's starting to rain, and it's going to be cold.
