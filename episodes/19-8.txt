<br/>Jeff Probst: Galu making a big move now on their puzzle. Previously on Survivor... Galu wins immunity! Since the start of the game, Galu has won almost every challenge, and they  seem invincible, but cracks are starting to show. The four guys formed an alliance and ticked off the women by electing Shambo  their leader. <br/>I thought the way to elect the new leader was stupid. <br/>Probst: And there's a feud brewing between Shambo and Laura. <br/>Clearly, she doesn't like me. <br/>Probst: On day 16, Galu won yet another reward challenge. Galu wins reward! So Shambo stuck it to Laura by sending her to Foa Foa for a short visit...  All the way. <br/>Probst: ...and denying her a once-in-a-lifetime reward. <br/>I think it was her own little way of saying, "I'm leader now, and what I  say goes."  Probst: At Foa Foa, Russell and Natalie immediately pounced on Laura. <br/>Natalie's doing a good job talking to Laura around the camp. If we merge, we need somebody on the inside. <br/>Probst: When Foa Foa lost another immunity challenge... Galu wins immunity! ... they went to Tribal Council, and Russell made good on his threat to knock  out Liz. <br/>You're the weakest link when it comes to trust. <br/>Probst: Liz, the tribe has spoken. Outnumbered eight to four, Foa Foa now needs a miracle in order to survive. 12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>So tomorrow if we got to go get it... As a tribe, we're down to four people,  so we're in a horribly inferior position to the Galu tribe, and so it makes  our job even more difficult, 'cause we got to try to struggle to get to a  merge and then try and divide and conquer. Otherwise, we're all screwed. <br/>What is that, 12 people left? <br/>So it's a possibility the next thing is a merge. Yeah, when we get over there, dude, the game on. <br/>Game on. <br/>The game starts. If we all stick together and all talk to somebody different, man, at least  one of them's going to work for us. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You know? Foa Foa needs a merge. We have some strong ideas once we get over there. We plan on working as a team, talking to different people. <br/>There's segregation in their tribe. In our tribe, Foa Foa, there's unity. We're all working as a team, so I'm not really nervous about my numbers. I'm too good for this game. I'm too sly, and now I've got to make sure my seed is planted in all of these  dumb asses' heads. So once we do merge, we can stir them up over there. *  Since my return from the Foa Foa tribe, seems like there's definitely a lot  of tension. I mean, clearly, Shambo doesn't like me in camp. And that was a huge reason why I got sent over to the Foa Foa tribe. <br/>Yeah, that makes nine, and that means there's one somewhere, because I  brought it back. Do you want to take my canteen until we find it? <br/>I have no reason to lie to anybody. <br/>I wasn't accusing you of lying. I was just asking where the canteen was. <br/>Laura, for two or three days, you've been coming at me. If you want to take a walk with me so we can sort things out, I'm good with  that, but if you don't, it's okay. <br/>I don't need to work anything out. I don't know what's going on with me and Shambo. When I got sent over to the other tribe, Dave handed her my canteen. I didn't care. But when I came back to camp, I said, "Where is it?" And then, she  makes this huge, big deal, and then, all of a sudden, brings up all these  other things that I have no idea what she's even talking about. <br/>There's some, like, little power struggle going on between you and I, and I  don't get it. I don't understand it. I don't like it. It's like there's this 90210 little young thing in you going on, and, uh,  it-it's just... it's bizarre to me. <br/>Now, how you perceive that, if your feelings get hurt, and if you're, like,  "Well, what's her problem?," well, that's on you. <br/>It wasn't a fight about canteens. It really is the way that she treats me on a regular basis. It's almost like those popular girls in high school that are cheerleaders  that want to snob their nose at people that don't fit into their circle. I'm done with her. I have no use for her, none. <br/>You have a way of turning things about, so, like, now I look like the bad  person, like I blew this whole thing up, like, "Where is my canteen? Where is my canteen?"  They're totally arguing over nothing, absolutely nothing. Totally pissed off at nothing. Fantastic. <br/>So my feeling is, so now I have to suffer. I'm without a canteen. <br/>To be honest, we know Shambo's crazy, so if you get in a fight with Shambo,  who's the one who looks bad? You look bad. You fight with Shambo, that means you're just as crazy as her, only you're  not really crazy. You're just being a bitch. <br/>"It's time to follow your leader. Face to face with your rivals once more. With your bodies pumped, and your minds sharp, your taste buds and stomachs  can score." Oh, that would be awesome. <br/>Sooner or later, something has to change for us. I'm hoping today is the day. We're not super confident in our ability to win challenges anymore, uh, but  we just don't want to lose any more immunity challenges, 'cause the four that  we have is the four we want to go into a merge with. They're the people that we think can really, really help us out when we get  there. <br/>We got tree mail. It's so vague, we don't really know what it really means. I mean, it doesn't sound like the merge, but I'm pretty confident it is about  to happen, so I have to take my immunity idol everywhere I go. We only have four people now, but we have such a tight group, so it's not  over. There's so much more to this game than playing a physical game with somebody. You have to be able to outwit them. That's the most important thing of the whole game. <br/>We were going to the challenge. We were walking down the beach, the other tribe's coming down the beach  towards us, and we're meeting at this treasure chest. And Jeff isn't around, so everyone's kind of on edge, not really sure what's  happening. (overlapping chatter) (whoops)  Nice! <br/>I'm so excited. <br/>"Congratulations, Foa Foa and Galu. You are now one tribe." (applause and cheering) (laughter) Good job. <br/>New buffs for everyone! <br/>"You will all go back to live at the old Galu camp. Take some time to get to know your new tribe mates. A feast awaits you down the beach." (screams, cheers and chatter) I  can't even tell you the sense of relief that I felt reading that it was the  merge. I no sooner got those words out of my mouth that I just knew it was going to  be a hell of a good day. (screaming)  Oh, my God. <br/>Oh... my... God. (screaming, overlapping chatter)  I'm actually really, really, really happy that we merged, and the feast was  delicious. There was chicken, all seasoned and roasted. There were cheeses and fruits. <br/>Look at the size of these grapes! <br/>Oh! <br/>Mmm! <br/>It was, like, literally a feast fit for royalty. <br/>To our new tribe. <br/>To our new tribe! (whooping and chatter)  To Samoa. <br/>Cheers! <br/>Galu-Foa Foa merge. I am on top of the world, man. I'm in heaven right now. You guys, these are lemon meringue mini pies. <br/>This is what we've all been talking about. <br/>I am on such a sugar high right now, I'm, like, "My prayers were  answered totally."  Uh, yeah. Got a mechanical engineering degree. <br/>Congratulations. <br/>Like, at first, I thought "These hermit crabs are great," but after  about seven or eight days, I'm, like, "I never want to eat another one  of these things." You know what I mean? <br/>Russell is the best crab catcher, though. <br/>Things are about to change totally in this game. The other tribe-- I don't think they even realize it right now. <br/>I'm not bad, right? I'm not overbearing? <br/>I'm looking around at Foa Foa when everybody is taking that step to do  exactly what we said in camp. <br/>I'm a good snuggler. <br/>Get with these people, bring them under your wing and connect with them. <br/>It was a good day. <br/>We're steps ahead of them. We already have our plan down. <br/>Cheers. (laughing)  The ones I know I can trust-- they're doing exactly like I want them to do,  and it's going to get stronger as we go along. <br/>I can already see that I'm the ruler in this kingdom. <br/>Got it? <br/>I mean, come on. Who gets grapes fed to them? The kings do. <br/>This is it! <br/>Our new home, buddy. <br/>Welcome, you guys. <br/>Thanks for having me. <br/>Do y'all have a certain place for bags, and....? <br/>Now we got some more body warmth, too. <br/>That's our kitchen. <br/>Oh. <br/>This is what we call the cutting board, or the kitchen sink. <br/>Y'all are, like... The Galu camp-- I love it. It's awesome. I feel like I'm at the Hilton. You know, at Foa Foa, we had absolutely nothing. Here at Galu, there's blankets, pillows. Everybody-- it really seems like a family. <br/>I'll show you where our water and stuff is. <br/>Okay. Laura kind of took me under her wing. She was kind of like mother hen, showing me around, and it was really nice,  because it was really important for me to talk to Laura to find cracks in  this group. Make no mistake, there are cracks. It's just, are there enough cracks and big enough cracks to get the numbers  on our side? <br/>We got to pick a name. Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas? <br/>Slow-mo? <br/>Does anybody have any funny Samoan slang? <br/>Aiga is, uh, Samoan for extended family. <br/>Cool! <br/>What is it? Aiga? <br/>Aiga. <br/>Aiga. <br/>That sounds good to me. <br/>I like Aiga. <br/>All in favor of Aiga, say aye. <br/>Aiga. <br/>Aiga. <br/>Aiga. <br/>Aiga it is. <br/>That's it. <br/>No, I like it. <br/>That's all I get. <br/>Foa Foa-- the only thing that they have going for them is they have a new  beach, and they have new people to talk to. They're starting over. They're on day two. I'm on day 19. I have the hidden immunity idol. It's in my pocket. And that's power in this game. And they think that they're going to strategize and make friends, and  la-la-la, we're an extended family. Like, the name of our tribe, Aiga, means extended family. Ugh! (laughter) Extended family? What's Samoan for "Get the hell off my island?"  I definitely have tricks up my sleeve. Day one at Foa Foa, I was very aggressive. I went to everybody right off the bat, and my plan happened. It happened like I wanted to. Over here, I'm going to go to people, saying the same things, doing exactly  the same strategy, but I have the idol to be able to make them sway my way. <br/>Obviously, I didn't find this on the beach. It's the real deal. Now, if you could take me to the top seven, I'll hand it to you. I'll give it to you. I swear I will. <br/>Okay. <br/>Nobody. Everything's between me and you. <br/>Okay. So top seven? <br/>Top seven, I'll hand it to you. <br/>I can't believe Russell showed me he had the idol. But you know what? Desperate people do desperate things. I don't believe he would give that to me, but just knowing that he has it is  huge, which means when we do get rid of him, it's going to have to be a big  blindside. <br/>There's a few rules that I want to put in place with this deal. You can get rid of my guys whenever you want, but the first one to go has to  be one of your guys. <br/>That won't happen. <br/>You don't think? <br/>That won't happen. <br/>Who do you want the first one to go, one of my guys? <br/>It'll be one of your guys or Shambo. <br/>Right. <br/>It's kind of funny. Russell came to me with this attitude of, like... "I'm the boss, and  here's some rules," he tells me. And I'm, like, "Okay, well, just so you know, I kind of hold all the  cards right now, and, um, you just need to try and stay alive." You're  in a worse position than myself at this point. You're coming here with ten percent. I got 90. <br/>Right. Laura's digging her own grave. She told me, "I'm 90% in charge of this, Russell. You're about ten percent right now." In other words, sit down and listen. No. It don't work like that for me. Okay. She might be the first to go. All right, well, I'm just going to try to win them all, then. (Laura laughs) What else can I do? I went to Laura. I thought it wasn't going to really work, so I'm going to do the same thing  with somebody else. Maybe, uh... uh... Monica. <br/>...I would give this to you and let you use it. <br/>I'm in. <br/>Okay. This has to stay between me and you...  Absolutely. <br/>...or this won't work. Monica didn't mean a word she said over there on the rocks. I see it in her eyes, but she might actually start meaning what she tells me  if I get rid of her boss. I get rid of Laura, she comes a-runnin'. Now, if we can get one of the guys on my side, that would be gold. I'll get rid of Laura one way or the other. <br/>That's crazy. <br/>I got it with no clue. <br/>That is impressive, bro. <br/>I'm telling you, dude, we can be in control of this game without them even knowing. I can convince my people to vote whoever I say. I know you can do the same. <br/>Mm-hmm. Right. <br/>Dude, I swear, if I think your butt's on the line, I don't have a problem  giving it to you, and letting you use it. <br/>And then we'll keep driving it, yeah. <br/>You're the only one here that can do it with me. I see that. <br/>Russell divulged to me that he had the hidden immunity idol. I think because Russell's an aggressive player, and he realizes that maybe  having a relationship with someone like me is something that could be very,  very beneficial to him in this game. <br/>Do you think Laura is trustworthy? <br/>What do you think? <br/>I think she should go first, 'cause once she's gone, the girl power is over. <br/>Yeah. Laura and Monica have a relationship that is potentially dangerous. And even though it's going to be viewed as a big move, I think it's a  manageable risk to vote off Laura first, while we have votes from the other  tribe. <br/>My guys are going to vote Laura. Right. <br/>Then I'll go get some cavalry. That's crazy, bro. <br/>And then it could be me and you at the end. <br/>That is crazy. <br/>Me and John could be a good team, I believe. He's smart enough to know what's going on, so things are going to get crazy  tomorrow out here. <br/>All right. <br/>We're going to turn this game on its side. <br/>Hey. <br/>Shake your hand as a man. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>This is... I'm a... I'll be... I'll honor what I say right now. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>You ever heard of a man named Babe Ruth? He struck out more than anybody ever. But you know what? He also hit the most homeruns, so that tells me one thing. Keep swinging, baby. Eventually, you're going to hit one. (laughs)  No, I'm using a-a snail. Shambo's a really good person, and we do connect. I think it has a lot to do with my Southern background. People trust the South. So she could be one of my numbers. I mean, I could use her for that. <br/>Of course I am. Knowing what a little spiteful snake she is. She's half the battle. <br/>We got in quite the little scene. She was just being a bitch to me. I said, "What is your problem? You've been very, very mean-spirited and just, you know, awful to me."  Wow. Shambo hates Laura. She hates her. So I know at any point, she'll vote Laura's name. You know, get rid of a strong player, Laura, and get rid of the snake. <br/>I trust Russell implicitly. The guy is definitely cut from the same cloth as me. He's a country boy. I'm a country girl. And he just keeps bringing up that Laura needs to go first. She's the bane of my existence in Samoa. So, it's not like we need this multi-layered plot. Write Laura's name down tonight. It's that simple. You need to make sure that you have the conversation. Pull Jaison off to the side. <br/>Pull Mick off to the side. <br/>Pull Natalie off to the side. <br/>And tell them, "No matter what, Laura is the only name we are writing  down." Okay? <br/>Sounds good to me. <br/>Outstanding. Carry on. <br/>It was easy to control these minds. Way easier than I thought. John's on board, and I have Shambo in my pocket. So if we can get rid of Laura, this whole game might change. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You have now merged into one tribe. It's a completely different game. You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Dave, I'll take back tribal immunity. Now that you're merged into one tribe, tribal immunity is no more. Individual immunity is what you covet. When you are wearing this, you are safe at Tribal Council. Let's get to the challenge. Today, you'll participate in a game of good, old-fashioned Survivor T-ball. It's very simple. <br/>Sweet! <br/>Probst: One at a time, you'll place your ball on the tee, take a swing. Whatever section your ball lands in, you score that many points. Highest score wins immunity. And for today's challenge... there are two necklaces. (low whistles)  Probst: Because two people will win immunity. The women will take on the women. The winner gets immunity. The men will take on the men. The winner gets immunity. Make sense? <br/>Yes. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Probst: We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. Dave Ball, you're first up for the men. <br/>Let's go, Dave. <br/>Go, Dave. <br/>Let's go, Danger Dave. <br/>Ugh! <br/>Probst: Danger Dave. Baseball your sport? <br/>Uh, no, making love's my sport. (laughter)  Probst: You play a lot? <br/>Not often enough. (laughter)  Geez. <br/>Let's go, Dave. That a boy. <br/>Probst: Nice swing. Where's it going to drop? <br/>There you go! <br/>Probst: Pops into the three. <br/>Go, Dave. <br/>Probst: Not a bad score. <br/>Dave-O. <br/>Good job, Dave. <br/>Probst: Jaison now up. Three is the mark to beat. Got a chance. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: On and off the course for Jaison. Jaison, you cannot win immunity. (applause)  Good job. <br/>Probst: Russell's up. Dave's still the mark to beat at three. Russell gives it a ride. <br/>Nice, Russ. <br/>All right, Russ. <br/>Probst: Lands it in the four. <br/>Nice. <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Probst: That puts Russell in the lead. <br/>Good shot. <br/>Good job, Russell. <br/>Probst: Brett is up. Russell has four, which means you have to land in a five or the ten up in the  sky. That might do it. <br/>Aw! <br/>Nice try, Brett. <br/>Probst: And off the course. <br/>Nice try, Brett. <br/>Good shot, baby. <br/>Probst: Brett cannot win immunity. <br/>That was a good hit. <br/>Go, Mick. <br/>Probst: Mick is up. Russell still in the lead at four. Mick needs to get something in the four to five range here. That won't do it. Mick scores two. <br/>Ugh! <br/>Probst: That's not enough. Mick out of this challenge. Erik, take your swing. Russell still in the lead with four points. <br/>Going for the ten, baby. <br/>Probst: Going for the ten. <br/>Let's go, Erik. <br/>Probst: All the marbles. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Oh! A nice swing. Just off the course, though. Ends up zero. <br/>Good swing, though. <br/>You looked good. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Yeah, at least you looked good. <br/>Probst: John. <br/>All right. <br/>Probst: The last person. Russell is one person away from winning immunity. Russell with four, which means, John, you have to land in a five or the ten  to win immunity. John gives it a ride. Nicely done. John lands in the five. <br/>My God! (applause)  Probst: John wins individual immunity. <br/>Nice one, John! <br/>Holy crap, Johnny! <br/>Good job, John. <br/>Probst: All right. The women are now up. Natalie, you're first up for the women. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Probst: Natalie down and hard. It bounces out of the course. (all groaning) No score for Natalie. <br/>No! Nat! <br/>Oh, goodness! <br/>Probst: Monica's up. Another lefty. Monica, nice swing. <br/>Girl. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Probst: Ends up in the two. Monica scores two. <br/>That a way, baby. <br/>Probst: Kelly, you're up. Two is the mark to beat. <br/>Oh, good job, Kelly. <br/>Probst: Kelly. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: With a three. <br/>Good job, Kel! <br/>Probst: That puts Kelly in the lead. Shambo's up. <br/>Let's go, Sham. <br/>Probst: Three is the mark to beat. Big swing. <br/>Lovely. <br/>Probst: Little result. <br/>Outstanding. <br/>Probst: No score for Shambo. Laura, you're up. <br/>Score. <br/>Probst: The last person. Kelly-- still the mark to beat at three. You're going to need at least a four to win immunity. Laura lands it in the four. Laura wins individual immunity! (applause)  Good job, Laura. <br/>You did good. <br/>Probst: Laura, John, come on over. Congratulations. (applause)  Good job. <br/>Probst: Congratulations. Safe tonight at Tribal Council. John and Laura cannot be voted out at tonight's Tribal Council. As for the rest of you, one of you going home tonight. Should be an interesting afternoon for the newly-merged camp. By the way, what is your name? <br/>Aiga. <br/>Probst: Aiga. All right, Aiga, grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you at Tribal. <br/>When I saw Laura win immunity, I got a gut-wrenching feeling in my stomach. The plan had been put into motion. We were going to write down Laura's name tonight, and now we can't. So, that sucked, because I really wanted her gone. <br/>Thank you. <br/>They can't win anything. <br/>No. No. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I don't know 'cause I haven't talked to anybody yet. <br/>I'm getting rid of the girl thing. <br/>Well, dude, that ain't going to happen. <br/>You don't think? <br/>No. The problem is Erik and Laura-- they will decide who will go today. If that means that we will lose a number on your tribe, we lose a number. <br/>Laura would definitely be gone, but she won immunity today, and Shambo-- she  don't want to get rid of Monica. She says that's not going to happen. She wants to let one of our guys go. I'm sure I'm being targeted, so I don't want to have to play the idol, but if  I'm feeling antsy about tonight, I might have to go that route. <br/>Yes. <br/>Uh-huh. I know he has it. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Damn it! He thinks he's going to go first, so I bet you he's going to play it tonight  anyways. <br/>Yeah. Yeah...  Perfect. <br/>So the fact that he has it seems kind of dangerous. <br/>I know, I know. <br/>We all know that. I know. Listen. Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me. This morning it was supposed to be Laura. Laura won immunity, saved Laura. The next best thing that you can do to weaken Laura is to ax Monica. Some members of Galu-- they just want to go down the line-- Foa Foa, Foa Foa,  and it's like they're playing really junior varsity Survivor right now. There are tons of inherent risks to breaking up the team that we've worked  this far to develop at Galu, but it's a risk I'm comfortable with, because I  still believe that it's in our best interest to get rid of Monica. <br/>I can calm her down. <br/>But you keep her at bay, you keep her at bay. <br/>I can calm her down. You know, at first I didn't like the idea. However, by allowing me to vote with Laura, when she gets spooked after  Tribal Council, she'll have nobody to turn to but me, and I can go ahead,  gain her trust, which could be good for me down the road. <br/>Are we gonna use Foa Foa? <br/>We are? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Here's what needs to happen. A: nobody talks to Shambo. Period. <br/>Perfect. <br/>Let her vote whatever she wants. <br/>Okay? <br/>If you go Monica, Monica, Monica, it's done. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Erik-- he wanted to vote Monica, which is crazy. The plan to just vote Foa Foa and shoot them down, you know, turkey shoot--  pop, pop, pop, pop, so there may be something going on in Erik's head that he's  not letting on 'cause he's a crafty, crafty dude, and that makes me a little  nervous. (buzzing)  ...then definitely the three of you will stay, and I'm pretty sure Russell  will stay, anyway, so... We want him to think that he's going home tonight. That way, he plays the idol. So, what you need to know, you know. You choose a different route, there will be a different outcome, I can't  guarantee the four of you are here tomorrow. <br/>Here's how I feel right now. I feel like Erik is talking ... to the tribe. <br/>Erik told us that if we get Russell to flush out the idol and use it tonight,  they will agree to vote out one of their own, um, instead of one of us, but  to be honest with you, I don't really like that guy. So I kind of want to just put four votes on Erik and-and let the ball roll. <br/>I don't know who...  But I could leave this game easily, knowing that he went before me. <br/>Why is he freaking out? <br/>He wants all of the girls gone. <br/>I don't trust Erik. <br/>He was... Here's the thing. <br/>Well, because there's no way to pull it together. Like, we can ask Kel. <br/>Okay, okay. <br/>Okay, Kel. <br/>The thing of it is, like, Galu still has plenty of people, plenty. I'm telling you, y'all, he is going to wreak havoc. Kelly and Laura-- I just basically let them know that Erik needed to go now. We have four people. They have eight. It's not a big deal if they lose one. I'm definitely putting my faith in Laura and Kelly, and I'm just going to  hope that it works. <br/>What?! <br/>He's trying to get you off tonight. <br/>Are you serious? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Really? Everyone's on board? <br/>He's manipulating everybody. <br/>Yeah, I know, but...  Tonight Erik goes. <br/>Who's Erik? <br/>Erik. <br/>Our Erik? <br/>Yes. <br/>Wait. <br/>This is the first time that I don't know nothin'. All of a sudden, all hell breaks loose. All the girls want to vote Erik out now. I don't know what they're thinking. They could possibly be saying, "Hey, let's say, vote Erik. That way Russell will feel way comfortable, won't use his idol, we'll vote  him out." And then, they get me and the idol. <br/>This is like going to Vegas. <br/>Yeah. <br/>What else can we do? They blindside one of us, we go home, we eat pizza. <br/>What concerns me is that it just seems almost too easy right now, and that  makes me uncomfortable. Fortunately, I got my idol in my pocket, and I'll use it if need to use it. <br/>Probst: Jaison, take me through the merge. Foa Foa's already down to four people. Now you have to go over to Galu's camp where they've been living this whole  time. <br/>I mean, it's almost as frustrating as-as losing challenges, you know? But at least with the challenges, we had some say in it. So for me, a guy who is used to having at least some control over his life, I  think more than even frustration, you just feel helpless. <br/>Probst: Monica, how does this merge change the trust in the game? Before it was, can I trust the people on my tribe? Does it suddenly become, I have to trust the people on my tribe? <br/>In this game, you never really know who to trust. I mean, someone could be saying something to your face, and then saying  something completely different behind your back. So even though Foa Foa is down in numbers, someone could turn their back on  you. You just really never know. <br/>Probst: Erik, looking at the four Foa Foa, what do you think Galu should base  the vote on? <br/>You know, to me, I struggle to see anything that Foa Foa has to offer Galu. Let's just say that they were able to get a Galu member to turn in a very  cohesive team, I would be floored if I saw them get one, let alone two or  three that they would need to actually spin this game. And that's not me being cocky or confident. But I just struggle to see what it is that they can do, you know. Your heart goes out to them, but, you know, they're in the hole. <br/>Probst: Russell, Erik's saying, "You don't offer us anything. Why do we need you at all?"  Well, I don't like pity. I think that we have a lot to offer, and I think he's going to be surprised. <br/>Again, you see the tenacity in the eight of us since day one, so it's a long  shot. <br/>Probst: But can you understand why somebody who's down in numbers, like Foa  Foa, would do anything to try to stay alive? <br/>I think one way to look at it is, how is it that they've reacted to the merge  and mingling with us? I'll tell you right now-- Russ goes out there and scrambles. He's been in everybody's ear. Uh, Mick comes in, he does his thing, he takes it on the chin. He says the numbers are what they are. Natalie doesn't want to step on anybody's toes. And Jaison is-is just an enigma, because you see this intelligence, and you  see this physical prowess and his athleticism, but you don't really see it  come together. <br/>Probst: Jaison, basically saying you got great potential, but not doing  anything with it. <br/>Um, you can take a look at my  rÃ    sumÃ    . I'm here to play a game. I'm here to be strategic in my own way. So, I have a strong, strong problem with that... with that comment. <br/>I mean, you want to talk about  rÃ    sumÃ    s, let's look at your  rÃ    sumÃ     in this game from day  one. You know, I'm thinking you're making my point. <br/>Honestly, the personal attacks on me in which someone says I can't put it  together just-- they-they eat at me. You know, for 28 years, I've been fighting to-to do things, to accomplish  things, and I feel like people have doubted me the entire way, and I've had  to push through roadblocks that I couldn't go around or under or over, and so  I think maybe it just takes me back to those days. And I've tried to play this game hard, but not take it too seriously, but  sometimes, you know, something just kicks in, so...  Well, I like that. You know, I like that in a player. If I was your coach, I would say that's what I like to hear. <br/>I guess the point is that I don't care what you like. <br/>Probst: Russell, there's a lot of judgment coming from Galu to the Foa Foa  group. Are you feeling a little attacked or maybe misunderstood? <br/>No, not at all. You know, we can still make this happen. This... We still have hope. <br/>Probst: So, Erik, you got to respect Russell saying, "I don't care that  we're down to four. I still believe I can win this game."  I do respect the fact. He does not strike me as someone who gives up. I respect that. But this type of competitiveness is misaligned, and if he doesn't focus it within  the next couple of days, if it's repairable, then I can't say 100% I respect  it. <br/>In other words, just roll over and get voted out quietly. Well, that ain't going to happen. I will talk to each and every individual up here, and I'll try to strategize  with everybody to try to stay in this game. I ain't going to stop playing. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. John and Laura, you both have individual immunity tonight. If you want, you can assign that immunity to somebody else. <br/>Never in my life, Jeff. <br/>I'll keep it. <br/>Probst: All right, you cannot vote for John. You cannot vote for Laura. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. Dave, you're up. *  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. <br/>Everybody knows I have it. I might as well play it. <br/>Probst: The rules of Survivor state that if anybody plays a hidden immunity  idol, then any votes cast against that person will not count, and the person  with the next highest number of votes will be voted out. This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Russell tonight will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote-- Jaison. Jaison. Two votes-- Jaison. Erik. Two votes-- Jaison. One vote-- Erik. Erik. Two votes-- Jaison. Two votes-- Erik. Erik. That's three votes-- Erik, two votes-- Jaison. Erik. That's four votes-- Erik, two votes-- Jaison. Erik. That's five votes-- Erik, two votes-- Jaison. Erik. Six votes-- Erik, two votes-- Jaison. Seventh person voted out of Survivor: Samoa, and the first member of our  jury-- Erik. That's seven. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Good, B. <br/>Probst: Erik, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Well, your first vote as a new tribe, first blindside. This is most definitely a new game. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor. <br/>Russell, Natalie, Mick, Jaison. <br/>Probst: The old Galu declares open season on Russell. <br/>Russell is the most conniving player in the game right now. He needs to go. <br/>Probst: And now he's out of idols...  It was the dumbest move, playing that idol. <br/>Probst: ...low on friends...  It's got to be Russell. <br/>Probst: ...and in need of luck. <br/>This is the first time that I'm struggling on what to do. <br/>Wow. Wow. Wow. I'm disappointed, but I said playing Survivor would be looking into a mirror,  and I'm pretty proud of the face I see. I don't regret going home with the idol, 'cause you can't defend against  something that's invisible, and this blindside was invisible to me. But I gave 100% of my heart, and I can hang my hat on that.
