<br/>JEFF Probst: Last week, 20 seasons of Survivorled up to our most epic battle  yet. Rob Mariano, one of the game's ultimate strategists, and also one of the  biggest double dealers, had recreated himself as a hero. <br/>A lot has happened with me personally in my life in the six years since I've  played this game. I'm learning compromise and patience. <br/>Probst: He led his tribe of Villains by being a straight shooter and working  hard. <br/>I'm in awe of Rob. You are the man. And it's like, when you talk, I'm literally hanging on every word. <br/>I appreciate it. <br/>Probst: Because of his efforts, the tribe flourished. Rob jumps down on the final piece! Villains win immunity! But he made an enemy of Russell. <br/>Watch your back, man. <br/>Yeah, well, same thing for you, man. <br/>Probst: Who used lies, intimidation and chaos to further his own  self-interest. <br/>I'm that good, where I can bring people together in this game for my good. <br/>Probst: So Rob's leadership was short-lived. <br/>My idea of trust and loyalty is different from Russell's. <br/>Probst: Motivated by jealousy, Russell used his power of persuasion and  gathered enough votes to eliminate his adversary. Rob. The loss of Rob has given the Heroes a chance at a comeback. Now, they're down only two members. [shrieks happily] And they've even discovered a clue to a hidden immunity  idol. <br/>We're going to look for it together. <br/>Probst: But the bigger question: how will losing Rob's leadership and  challenge dominance impact the Villain tribe? <br/>The waters are so muddy right now. I mean, we were in the best position possible. <br/>Probst: Coach, Courtney and Sandra refused to vote for Rob, and now they're  trapped in a tribe controlled by Russell, whose ego may have just put the Villains  in a hole they can't Villains in a hole they can't get out of. get out of. [laughs]  Boston Rob was after me. You know what? I just won. Big-time Boston Rob, the super All-Star-- he ain't nothing on me. <br/>It's, like, game on now, huh? <br/>I'm controlling this game. I'll take care of all of them, one at a time. This is Russell Hantz. If you ain't with me, you're If you ain't with me, you're against me. against me. <br/>It's fun. <br/>So much fun. <br/>I only like doing it to people that deserve it. <br/>Me, too. [women laughing]  I did not want Boston Rob out. We screwed up the whole tribe. Ridiculous that they're cowards and they want to vote out Boston Rob, because  Russell is a bully. No more, no less. No more, no less. He's a bully. He's a bully. <br/>I mean, I didn't want to vote off Rob this early, either. I really didn't. And the more I thought about it, the more I was really upset about it. about it. I miss him already. I miss him already. <br/>I wasn't quick to get rid of him. What are you talking about? <br/>I feel like Jerri made a big mistake in aligning with Russell. Now I'm forced to go that direction, and I feel at this point that it's an  alliance point that it's an alliance based on lies. based on lies. Are we going to the final five with them or are we going to with them or are  we going to try to make a play? try to make a play? <br/>I say we just see what happens at the merge. <br/>The Villains are in the crapper. I don't think we'll win another challenge. We're done. We're toast. Pray for the merge. Pray for the merge. [theme song playing] [theme song playing]  Beautiful. How high up do you want to go? <br/>I say we bring it up pretty high. <br/>Where's J.T.? <br/>I don't know. <br/>The Hero tribe has plans to look for the hidden immunity idol as a group, but  the best thing for me is to make sure I know where it's at. This is Survivor,and you don't know what these other people are thinking  around here. The clue said that the idol's in the creek or something. So I'm just going to swing by So I'm just going to swing by there and take a  gander. there and take a gander. Perfect. I'm going to get the hell out I'm going to get the hell out of here while I  still can. of here while I still can. <br/>You just found it now? Oh, my God. <br/>Let's get out of here. Immediately after I found it, I was like, you know what? I better get out of here, 'cause I wasn't sure if I was going to tell anyone. And before I could even move, Amanda walked up, so I was like, Amanda walked  up, so I was like, well, I'll show her. well, I'll show her. <br/>You found it? <br/>I just found it. Then, immediately, Candice walked up, so I was like, you know what, if I come  clean, our tribe will come together. No one is going to vote me out, No one is going to vote me out, because I  have it. because I have it. <br/>Right behind that tree. [laughs] I walked up, back up my alone walk...  Yeah. <br/>Five minutes. <br/>Can I see it? <br/>Yeah. The first one of us that needs this after the merge, we'll use it. <br/>It's a beautiful thing. <br/>Yep. <br/>And we're taking them down with it. <br/>Nice. <br/>Beautiful. <br/>Colby! <br/>Sweet! <br/>Sweet! Nice work, brother. Nice work, brother. <br/>You want some coconut? <br/>You want some coconut? <br/>I'm good. <br/>I'm good. <br/>Good thing you walked up. <br/>Good thing you walked up. How close was that? How close was that? J.T. found the hidden immunity idol, which is not so great in my book, because J.T. is the slimiest guy out here. He's running the tribe. He's got a little best friend interest with everybody. And every vote, he's been the one that's going back and forth, and  everybody's coming to him, trying to figure out which way is J.T. going to go. And nobody calls him out. I'm afraid to ever say anything about J.T., because he's, like, the golden  boy, you know. He's always right about everything. Like, he's always in with everybody. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Right? Isn't he in with you? <br/>Is he in with you? <br/>Isn't he in with Rupert? <br/>Isn't he in with Rupert? Isn't he in with Colby? Isn't he in with Colby? <br/>It would be in Amanda's best interest to work with me to get rid of him and  the idol or get rid of the idol. Either way. Either way. J.T.'s dangerous. J.T.'s dangerous. J.T.'s dangerous. <br/>I know. <br/>I know. <br/>We're all going to die. <br/>No, we're not. <br/>Yeah, we will. <br/>No, we won't. <br/>You can't not eat for that long. <br/>Yeah, you can. It's unbelievable. We're literally starving out here. And I'm worried. I mean, people are shutting down, and you can see it. I mean, we're already on our heels 'cause we're losing. The time for exigency has exited. It is do-or-die out here. <br/>"Now for a challenge that's good clean fun-- no oil, no mud, no brawling. It's not who strikes first but who strikes the most. Your best meal yet is calling."  It sounds like an individual type thing. <br/>Yeah, it does. <br/>Yeah, I mean, it doesn't say anything about tribe. "Your best meal yet is calling." Sounds like a merge to me. Today, the Villains are all hoping that it's a merge. It's a challenge of good, clean fun, and our best meal yet is calling, so I'm  happy about that. I think we should take it. <br/>I think we should take everything. <br/>Just in case we don't come back. I'm hoping and praying that it's a merge. And we don't know where we're going to end up, so we definitely want to get  all of our stuff together and take the tools, the tarp, all of our  belongings, because we could belongings, because we could end up somewhere  else. end up somewhere else. end up somewhere else. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Oh... my God! <br/>Wow! <br/>Oh, look, pizza, guys. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Heroes getting your first look at the new Villain tribe. Boston Rob voted out at the last Tribal Council. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Wow! <br/>Wow! <br/>Wow! <br/>Wow! <br/>Looks like we're, uh,  Looks like we're, uh, merging. merging. <br/>Probst: So, Rupert, shocked that Boston Rob is gone? <br/>It sure looks like they got a woman's alliance. <br/>Probst: Time will tell. <br/>When I found out that the Hero tribe thinks this is an all-girl alliance, I  thought they're making a huge mistake, because there's no girl alliance over  here. Rob got voted out last night because of me. But now, if we merge, the Hero tribe-- they'll let me know whoever they're  voting for if they think I'm the one that flop. Why wouldn't I flop if I'm in trouble? Like... help. [laughs]  Probst: Villains, you brought, clearly, your entire camp. Talk to me, Russell. <br/>I'm sure everybody has the merge in mind. And if there is a merge, we're prepared, they're not. <br/>The first thought I had when we saw them walk in with toolbox in hand was,  okay, go back through your mind. You read the same clue they did, what did I not pick up on? <br/>Probst: It's true, you have survived 18 days out here. No small feat. You've survived eight Tribal Councils. Very tough to do. And it does seem that you deserve a bit of a break. As you have all seen behind you...  Yes! <br/>Probst: ...a very nice feast. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: You'll all have an opportunity to enjoy this feast. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, wait. What?! <br/>Wait a minute, wait a minute! What's, what's the rub? <br/>Probst: Before we move any further, let me answer the question on everybody's  mind. Everybody drop your...  Yeah! <br/>Probst: ...expectations. [all groan]  Evil! <br/>Probst: We are not merging. <br/>Wah-wah-wah. Mean. <br/>Try and take it off. <br/>Probst: This is a reward challenge. Both tribes will have an equal opportunity to win it. You win it, you eat. Losers go back to camp, and if it is the Villains, you will clearly be  putting your shelter back together. <br/>That's right. <br/>Probst: Here's how it works: today's challenge, you're gonna do a little  Survivorbowling. It's very simple. You will square off against a tribe member from the other tribe. Your goal: roll the ball down the lane, knock over as many pins as you can. You get two rolls. Whoever knocks over the most pins scores a point for their tribe. First tribe to score three points wins reward. Villains, you have two extra members, sitting two people out. Cannot sit out the same two people in back-to-back challenges. Who are you gonna sit out? <br/>Didn't you guys say that you were good at bowling? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Sandra, do you want to bowl? <br/>This isn't open...  Probst: Give me an answer. <br/>Do you like to bowl? Are you good at bowling? <br/>Yeah, but think about it who we have to sit out in the next challenge. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Coach, who's sitting out? <br/>Sandra and Courtney. <br/>Probst: Sandra and Courtney are sitting out. You two take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to figure out your order, and we'll  figure out your order, and we'll get started. get started. All right, here we go. First round. Parvati for the Villains taking on Rupert for the Heroes. taking on Rupert for the Heroes. Parvati, give it a go. Parvati, give it a go. <br/>Gutter ball, gutter ball. All right! <br/>Probst: Gutter ball for the Villains. Opens the door for Rupert. <br/>That a boy, Rupe. <br/>Probst: Rupert knocks over three. <br/>That a way, Rupe. <br/>All right, Parvati, you got it. <br/>Probst: Parvati, you have to pick up at least three. <br/>Gutter ball, gutter ball, yes. <br/>Probst: Parvati, another gutter ball. Rupert doesn't even have to roll. Heroes win the first point and lead 1-zip. Next round, J.T. for the Heroes, taking on Danielle for the Villains. J.T., you're up. Right down the middle. <br/>Beautiful! <br/>Nice! <br/>Beautiful! <br/>Probst: Big hit by J.T., knocking over six pins on his first roll. <br/>Probst: Danielle has good form, but results in another gutter ball for the  Villains. J.T. with his second shot. Just misses. <br/>Oh, close! It's okay. <br/>Probst: Danielle, you have to knock over at least six pins. <br/>Come on, Danielle. <br/>You got it, Danielle. <br/>Come on, Danielle. <br/>Let's go, Danielle. <br/>Probst: That's not gonna do it. Danielle throws a gutter ball. Heroes now lead it two-zip. We're playing to three. Next round, Russell for the Villains, taking on Colby for the Heroes. Russell is the last chance or the Villains to stay in this challenge. Russell takes a little baby toss, and it results in an absolute goose egg for  the Villains. Colby with his Colby with his first shot for the Heroes. first shot for the Heroes. <br/>Bounce, baby! <br/>Probst: Colby bounces his down the middle, also results in a gutter ball. We are zip-zip. <br/>Go, Russell. <br/>Good shot. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yay! <br/>Probst: Russell knocks over five pins for the Villains, putting a lot of  pressure on Colby. Gotta pick up at least five. Colby throws, and knocks over one. [Colby blows raspberry] Villains are on the board. <br/>Yay! <br/>Probst: Heroes lead it 2-1. Playing to three. Next round. Coach from the Villains taking on Amanda from the Heroes. Big feast just sitting over there waiting on ya. Amanda could win it for the Heroes. Coach could tie it up. Coach rolls first. Nice roll by Coach knocking over five pins. Amanda now up for the Heroes. Amanda knocks over five pins. Two good first rolls. We're tied 5-5. We're tied 5-5. Coach, you're up. Coach, you're up. Coach with his second roll... knocks over one more, putting the pressure on  Amanda. Amanda, to win this, you need just knock down you need just knock down two  pins. two pins. Good roll. Amanda knocks over two pins just barely! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Heroes win their third-straight challenge in a row. <br/>Good bowling, Coach. <br/>Probst: Villains, got nothing for you. Grab all your stuff. Head back to whatever Head back to whatever is left of your camp. is left of your camp. All right, Heroes, you earned it. Enjoy your feast. Enjoy your feast. <br/>Thank you, Jeff! <br/>Thank you, Jeff! <br/>All right! <br/>All right! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Come on in, guys! <br/>Yay! <br/>This is so awesome! <br/>Shall we? <br/>Cheers! <br/>Cheers! <br/>Cheers! <br/>Good job, you guys. <br/>Mmm...  You guys, we kicked ass today. I love all y'all. Best team on Survivor right here. <br/>The fantastic five. <br/>Yay! <br/>I mean, I don't want to jinx us here, but we're on a little bit of a roll. But the Villains still have the numbers. So, in our minds, we're still catching up. We don't want to get overconfident. We just want to keep it going. <br/>This is good. <br/>Oh, God, this is good. <br/>I was not ready to merge yet. <br/>No, not yet. We need to knock two more of them out. <br/>How about Boston rob? [Rupert laughs]  Crazy. <br/>Insane voting him out! <br/>It was a bold move. <br/>It was a silly move. <br/>The moment Boston Rob left the game, I knew the guys were not in control  because he was their best competitor. So it's obvious; there's an all-woman's alliance over there. <br/>The girls are gonna expect you guys to jump in their girl alliance, but I  know...  We would be the first ones to find out who they're voting for. <br/>That's the whole thing. <br/>Now Coach and Russell are on the outs over there. They're sitting ducks. If we merge right now, we've got them on our side in a heartbeat, you know? So right now, I think we stick to our plan and just keep dominating. We're still losing. We got 'em on the hills. <br/>I love you all. <br/>I love you, too. <br/>It's a family, guys. <br/>Hear, hear. <br/>Hear, hear. <br/>To the fantastic five. <br/>To the fantastic five. <br/>Every single person on this team is an idiot. I just, I'm furious. This whole stupid thing, packing up the whole camp, just assuming there was  gonna be a merge. Are you kidding me? You know, voting off Rob was a big mistake. He would have made sure that Sandra and Courtney did not sit out today, that  they played, and they we had strong people in the immunity strong people in  the immunity challenge. challenge. <br/>We already made that mistake once and we just let it happen again. I looked at both of them of them and I said, "You guys, can you do  this?" And they're, like, "Um, And they're, like, "Um, I don't  know." I don't know."  You said, you said, no, you said, "I don't know."  It's, like, so now it's me and Courtney's fault that you guys lost? <br/>No, no, it's not. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying why did this stupid mistake get made again that we made the last  time? <br/>He's the one that said Sandra and Courtney. <br/>I know. <br/>So then me and Courtney are looking like, "Okay, so then we'll both have  to compete in the immunity challenge. That's a big mistake. <br/>Yeah, I said the same thing, but it was Coach. You said, "I really want pizza." And I said, "We don't need  pizza. We need an immunity. <br/>We need to eat and we need to win. Sandra and Courtney. Why are you blaming me and Courtney? <br/>I'm not blaming you and Courtney. <br/>Why? We didn't even do anything. <br/>All I'm saying is that if even once, you guys were like, "Hell, yeah,  "put me in there! I want to go."  So, in essence, the reason we lost today was because he and Courtney sat out. <br/>Again, no, that's not what it has to do with, again. <br/>I just don't understand. The minute we get back to camp, and you guys don't have a meal, all of a  sudden, it's me and Courtney. The worst tribe ever put together is the Villains tribe. I should not even be here. I should be with the Heroes 'cause I can't stand Jerri. I hate Coach, I hate Danielle. I hate Russell even more. So any of those-- I'm not going to pick one above the other 'cause I equally  hate the other 'cause I equally hate them all. them all. <br/>Tyson's gone, Rob's gone, and now we're the ones on the outs. ones on the outs. And it's 5-2. And it's 5-2. Russell's the kind of person where if he finds out somebody's gunning for  him, he'll take them out. he'll take them out. if one of us is going next.. if one of us is going next.. I'll be like, "Hey, Russell. Coach wants you gone." And I bet you Russell will believe me and get rid  of Coach, and me and Courtney will be saved again. I'm going to work my magic and we're both going my magic and we're both going  to be here on day 22 and day 23. to be here on day 22 and day 23. I didn't want to play this game without Tyson. I didn't want to play this game without Boston Rob. And it's like all that's out the window. <br/>I guess that maybe you feel guilty or something, but I know I'm the next one  to go. And what else is there to say, you know? It's based on Russell's idea of what he wants his Survivorto be like, and  everyone's going along with it everyone's going along with it out of, like,  fear or something. out of, like, fear or something. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh. <br/>But it don't matter what she says. I will tell them this is how we're voting. And that's how it's going to be. That simple. <br/>But at the same time, I heard Coach was saying that he made a mistake and he  wished he could go back. <br/>What mistake? <br/>Him letting Rob go home. That he should have never made the choice that he made, and that he's sorry. That's what he told her. And that he wanted to get rid of you. So, I don't know about your homeboy. <br/>Oh, he ain't my homeboy. I don't trust him. Obviously, you can't trust him. Because of that right there. He's going behind my back, saying stuff like that. You know... you know, he's... he's digging his own grave, just like Rob did. <br/>I told Russell that Coach was talking about voting for him, and Russell's so  stupid, he ate that crap up. I'm telling you, he's like, "Oh, my God, I can't trust him." And  the sooner he goes, the better. So, Russell, you don't know how to play this game. Yeah, he's done good so far, but with me, he don't know what but with me, he  don't know what he got himself into. he got himself into. <br/>He's going to flip. He's mad at me for getting rid of Rob, and now he's trying to stab me in the  back. <br/>Who does he think he is? <br/>And you know the beautiful thing about all this? If he goes, there's one guy left, and there's no doubt in their minds what's  going on. <br/>That there's a girl alliance. <br/>Once we merge, they ain't going to talk to one of the girls. They're going to be scared to death to, but they're surely going to come  straight to me. <br/>Perfect. <br/>Perfect. <br/>It's all falling together perfectly. Mmm. <br/>You've done that before. <br/>You've done that before. [laughter] [laughter] [laughter]  Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: First things first. Rupert? Take back immunity. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will be belted together in pairs. You'll race through the mud, going under and over a series of obstacles to  retrieve a flag. You'll then race back. First pair back with their flag scores a point for their tribe. First tribe to score two points wins immunity, is safe once again from Tribal  Council. Losers, you know what's happening. Somebody voted out of your tribe. Because we have odd numbers, one of the matchups will be a one-on-one  showdown. Villains, you have two extra members. Courtney and Sandra sat out last time. That means you are in this time. Who's going to sit out for the Villains? <br/>Why don't you and Danielle sit out and I'll play. <br/>Probst: Jerri and Danielle sitting out. All right. Sit-outs, take a spot over here. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize. minute to strategize. We'll get started. We'll get started. All right, we have our first matchup. It's Russell and Sandra taking on Amanda and Candice. For immunity. Survivors ready? <br/>Here we go. Here we go, team. <br/>Probst: Go! <br/>Come on, Amanda! Let's go, Candice! <br/>Probst: Amanda and Candice under the obstacle first. Russell and Sandra right behind. Sandra slow through that first obstacle. Carrying a lot of mud, you weigh a lot more. Amanda and Candice over for the Heroes. We're neck and neck at the second obstacle. <br/>Down, down! <br/>Dig, dig, dig! <br/>Grab, grab, grab! <br/>Let's go, let's go! <br/>Probst: Amanda and Candice have the flag for the Heroes. Russell and Sandra very slow under that third obstacle. Sandra really struggling. <br/>Come on, Sandra! <br/>Probst: Amanda and Candice taking their time. No rush at all. You can see the look on Russell's face. It says it all-- absolute frustration-- as Amanda and Candice continue  further down on the course. <br/>Beautiful. <br/>Probst: Amanda and Candice score for the Heroes. Sandra is stuck. Trying to back out of that challenge now. Heroes lead one-zip. Time for a showdown. Coach taking on Rupert one-on-one. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, Dragon Slayer! <br/>Go, Rupe! <br/>Probst: Both men go head first. Coach is out of the gate first for the Villains. Coach over the second obstacle first for the Villains. Coach flying through this course. <br/>That a way, Rupe! <br/>Probst: Rupert right on his tail. Rupert now picks up some ground. Both men have their flags. Rupert now in the lead for Rupert now in the lead for the Heroes. the Heroes. Rupert flies over that second obstacle. It's Rupert and Coach neck and neck. It's going to be a race to the finish. Coach wins for the Villains! We are tied one-one. All right, here we go. The final round. Parvati and Courtney taking on J.T. and Colby. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, you guys. Let's go, Courtney. J.T. and Colby dive head first. Parvati and Courtney very slow under that first obstacle. <br/>Come on, you guys. You guys, you got it! <br/>Courtney, let's go! Pick it up, girls! Let's go! <br/>Probst: Courtney and Parvati falling behind. J.T. and Colby head first again. <br/>Come on, you guys! You got it! <br/>Probst: J.T. and Colby have the flag. They're heading back. Parvati and Courtney are not even at their flag yet. Heroes are almost at the Heroes are almost at the end now. end now. This is not even close. J.T. and Colby score for the Heroes. Heroes win immunity! [cheering]  Yeah! Nice work! Nice work! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: You all right, Courtney? Courtney? <br/>She hurt her ankle. <br/>She hurt her ankle. <br/>Probst: See if you can make it on your own. If not, we'll get medical If not, we'll get medical in there. in there. Heroes, congratulations Heroes, congratulations once again. once again. No Tribal Council for the Heroes. The new five stays intact. Villains, four straight challenges in a row. Another trip to Tribal Council. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I'll see you tonight at Tribal. <br/>I want Courtney gone. I am a competitor. I hate losing. This is not fair to keep people in the game that don't have any physical  ability at all. And they're actually making And they're actually making us lose. us lose. <br/>I'm just going to jump in. <br/>Me, too. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Another day in the dirt. <br/>What a challenge. It was the muddiest one yet. You know how I look at it? You know how I look at it? It's like going to a spa. It's like going to a spa. <br/>Oh, you bruised your shoulder, too, right here. shoulder, too, right here. <br/>Right there. <br/>Right there. <br/>Everybody's down. Everybody's hurting. Everybody's nauseous. [inhales deeply] And the Dragon Slayer is just coming into his own. I feel full of energy, and it's time for me to shine. Off into the horizon. But, anyways, we're going to Tribal, and part of me says I ought to just get  rid of Russell tonight. He's knocked out both of my best friends in this game. But the way we're losing challenges, to keep one of the weaker girls and get  rid of Russell-- it might be a mistake. So, I guess I'm going to stay with the forced five alliance and vote out  Courtney, who is and vote out Courtney, who is the weakest link. the weakest link. [thunder rumbling] Any, uh, funny stuff going on? <br/>Everything's still the same as far as I'm concerned. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I get my mind set on one thing, and I do it. If I can't trust them, got to get rid of them. Coach-- Sandra said he wants me gone now. I have the power in this game. I send home who I want to send home. I've already talked to Parvati, and she's really on board with voting for  Coach. And Sandra and Courtney, I think they'll put Coach's name down for sure. So the big Coach, the Coach Man, the Dragon Slayer, he's going the Dragon  Slayer, he's going home tonight. home tonight. <br/>Honestly, if we don't merge, we're screwed. They're going to... they're just going to... we'll be done. <br/>That's what's going to happen anyway. We're losing every single one anyway. <br/>No, we're not. We have a chance if we have Coach. <br/>Look what we're doing with Coach. We're getting dominated. <br/>Because of Courtney  Because of Courtney and Sandra. and Sandra. <br/>That's a stupid move. I don't know how you're thinking right now. I don't know how you're playing the game. We keep Coach and we lose the next one, you'll make sure your butt's on the  line for that. You... you would put your butt on the line...  I'm just saying we have a better shot. <br/>I'm not... you are freaking out right now. Chill out. <br/>You ain't making any sense. <br/>Yes, I am! It's stupid to let him go. I don't think it's...  I just told you, I don't agree with it. <br/>You're not listening to me! <br/>I ain't going to ... talk to you no more. <br/>I'm ... giving you suggestions. <br/>Just calm down! <br/>I'm looking at it in different ways. You're just like...  Geez! <br/>Whatever, Russell. [groans] I think it's really stupid to get rid of another strong player. I mean, Courtney and Sandra can't do anything in the challenge. They've proved that to us a million times over. I mean, Courtney was just pathetic. And I think we have a shot at least with Coach. So, I mean, I threw that out there, and Russell freaked out and screamed at  me because he's just so in control of this game, and everything has to go the  way he wants it to go. So, I mean, as of right now, I'm up in the air. I got to really think about what I got to really think about what I want to  do. I want to do. <br/>Because she's such a competitor. You know what I'm saying? She was like, "I'm done suggesting things." So I think she must  have So I think she must have suggested something to Russell. suggested something to Russell. <br/>If my plan to vote out Coach doesn't work, I think Courtney is going home. I put a bug in Russell's ear that Coach wants to get rid of him. But Russell was talking to Danielle a few minutes ago. And the conversation-- it looked like it was going back and forth. So I don't know. All I can do is hope that Coach is going to go home, and that's is going to  go home, and that's it. it. <br/>Do you know where the saw is? The one that we open coconuts The one that we open coconuts with? with? <br/>I think Danielle might be right. We might need to keep him one more time. We can always take him out, any time we want. I think we should vote Courtney. <br/>It's absurd. First, Russell wants to vote off Coach. And then, all of a sudden, he wants to vote Courtney. Jeez! This tribe cannot get its act together. That's a problem. You know, we can't make a decision as a cohesive unit to decision as a  cohesive unit to save our lives. save our lives. <br/>We couldn't be no cooler. <br/>Hopefully, we all come together and vote out the dragon slayer. But who knows? They might still get together and, say, vote off the weakest and target me  and vote me out. You never know what's going to happen between now and when the happen between  now and when the sun goes down. sun goes down. <br/>Probst: Let's start tonight's Tribal Council by going back to the last two  Tribal Councils. Tyson and Rob-- the result: four straight losses with no end in sight. Danielle, any second thoughts about voting out Tyson and Rob? <br/>This decision was made. We thought it would be smarter, because they were such big threats. So, it is what it is, Jeff. We thought what we did was the right thing to do. <br/>Probst: But in a physical challenge, the only person who won a point today  was Coach. <br/>Ah. <br/>Probst: And if given the choice of Tyson or Boston Rob over, say, Courtney, I  think 99 out of 100 people would probably pick Tyson or Boston Rob-- no  disrespect. <br/>Thank you, Jeffrey. <br/>Probst: Courtney, you've sat out a majority of the challenges. <br/>That's what the team wanted to do. I don't have a big ego that has to go and run and play in every single thing. I wasn't a part of the decision to vote out Tyson or Rob, so I'm sad that  they're both gone. But insulting me is not going to bring them back. <br/>Probst: It's not meant as an insult. It's meant as just one person's observation. Boston Rob was dominating. <br/>I agree with you. <br/>Probst: But Danielle just told me that's why you voted him out. <br/>I didn't vote him out of our tribe. The tribe voted him out, because he was not in the dominating alliance. <br/>Probst: Coach, what do you think the take is on this tribe from the outside  looking in? <br/>I personally feel like people are probably laughing at us right now and  saying that we deserve it. Like, today, when we were getting ready for the challenge, I was trying to  energize people and I was, like, saying, "All right, come on, guys,  let's do it." And I had comments like, "Well, I'm gonna do my  best."  Probst: Courtney, you're not having any of that. <br/>When, you know, it's a reward challenge, it was Coach saying, "Well, I  want to eat, so A squad on." And then, "I don't care about the  immunity challenge, 'cause we'll put the two weak people in there." And  then, obviously, it will be one of the us going home. <br/>So what I hear from you is that the reason why our morale is down is because  of me. Is that what I'm hearing? <br/>Probst: That's what I heard. <br/>This is crazy. I don't sit there and make unilateral decisions and say, "By the way,  Courtney and Sandra, you guys should sit out every challenge." I've  never said that, because you don't ever sit out every challenge out here, so  I would never make a foolhardy statement like that. But what we all want as a tribe is for Courtney to say, "I want to do  that 'cause I can beat that challenge."  Thanks, Dad. <br/>He's a Coach. That's what he does. He tries to pick people up. <br/>I'm not saying that you don't mean well, it's just the way that...  Well, it certainly sounds like it when you say that I'm demoralizing the  entire tribe. Trust me, I am not the person that is demoralizing this tribe. In fact, it has absolutely nothing to do with me. <br/>Probst: Parvati, are you at all concerned that there may not be an end to  this slide? And if you ever do merge with the other tribe, your chances of winning and  getting to the end go down. <br/>I don't think it's that hard to see that we are definitely less athletic than  them. So if we continue to do these physical challenges, they're going to slaughter  us, and we're going to go, one by one, down that trail and our torches are  going to get put out by you. <br/>Probst: But we're talking around the thing that anybody watching will know to  be true, which is, you guys are making decisions based on alliances, the  assumption there might be a merge, and whatever else happens down the game. <br/>Of course! I mean, everyone's talking about a merge, and now all of the sudden, there's  not going to be a merge. And so it's target the weak, and I'm, like, poster child for weak Survivor. But I'm still here over a bunch of strong players, so twisted ankle, skinny  chick, whatever, I'm a determined little bitch, and I will put up with a lot  of crap to get to the end. You know? <br/>Fist bump. <br/>That's right, girl. [laughs]  Probst: Russell, how is tonight's vote going to change this tribe? <br/>Well, I think if you can keep the tribe stronger and keep the trust in place,  that's what you need to do. And that's what I'm doing tonight. <br/>Probst: And with that, it is time to vote. time to vote. Coach, you're up. Coach, you're up. <br/>You're a freaking lunatic.

Well, after tonight's Tribal Council, it's clear that the problem with trust,  as I'm sure Coach would agree, is you don't know it's gone until it's too  late. Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

I guess I should have played them. <br/>It's not the idol. <br/>Why do you say that? <br/>It's a ... stick! <br/>I want to give individual immunity to Natalie. <br/>Probst: But next time, you might see one that tops them all. <br/>I get a chance to talk to Russell, I give him the hidden Russell, I give him  the hidden immunity idol. immunity idol. <br/>I never thought that I would be going out so soon. I had so much that I wanted to accomplish and so much that I wanted to prove  and redeem. I'm exhausted, and still in a state of shock. But I am probably more pissed off than I've been in a number of years. And, you know, I really am not a very vindictive person, but I hope they get  wiped off the hope they get wiped off the face of the map.
