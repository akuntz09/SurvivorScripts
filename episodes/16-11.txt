<br/> <br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor, Ozzy was in the best  position to make it to the final four. He was in an alliance with the five  remaining favorites.  <br/>I trust them, and you've got to be able to trust some  people in this game.  <br/>Probst: And he had the hidden immunity idol. His only  competition seemed to be Jason, who beat him in the first individual immunity  challenge. Nice work. At the second individual immunity challenge, it was  down to Jason and Parvati when food was offered to the entire tribe if one of  them dropped out.  <br/>Jason! You can make friends!  <br/>I won't vote you out.  <br/>Probst: Then everyone in the tribe promised Jason they  would spare him if he stepped down.  <br/>I'll guarantee.  <br/>Probst: Jason took the deal, giving up a chance at  individual immunity in order to improve his position within the tribe.  <br/>Bon appÃ    tit.  <br/>Bon appÃ    tit.  <br/>Probst: The favorites agreed to vote Jason out  anyway.  <br/>We'd have to be idiots not to vote him out tonight.  <br/>Probst: But Parvati decided to double-cross Ozzy  instead.  <br/>I'm going to have to be untrustworthy and disloyal no  matter what.  <br/>Probst: She recruited everyone but James, Amanda, and Erik  and took Ozzy completely by surprise. Tenth person voted out of Survivor:  Fans vs. Favorites and the second member of our jury, Ozzy. Ozzy, the tribe  has spoken. Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight?  <br/>I understand why it happened. But when you think about it,  like, a blindside, it only works if it's airtight.  <br/>Right.  <br/>And obviously, like, I felt obligated to Ozzy, so I would  have told him. I probably would have told him, and I think you guys did the  right decision for... to pull that off. I don't know where Amanda is right  now. She totally, like, took off somewhere.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>And she's probably bumming like crazy.  <br/>It's just another game.  <br/>Sometimes you got to pull the punches.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>They got it. It's funny. I like it. It was a good move by  everybody.  <br/>I'm very upset about what happened last night. What nerve  for Cirie and Parvati to go behind my back and vote out Ozzy, making me look  like an idiot and the rest of my alliance looking like idiots because we  voted for Jason. You know, it's like Parv and Cirie and Alexis and Natalie  are an alliance now, and I think they want the men out of here. I thought we  were fine up until those votes, and then another Ozzy came up, and I was like,  "What the hell?" Every single person here wanted to vote for Jason.  It definitely told me that they're here to play this game. Game on. Bring it  on. Like, let's do this. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK  TELEVISION ( theme song playing )  <br/>So hot.  <br/>I know. If you give me one, I can add one from over this  side. It's not so hot. What is that, meat on your finger hanging off like  that?  <br/>Yeah. I'm trying to put coconut juice, coconut oil.  <br/>Oh, oh. James's finger wasn't really doing too good. He's  had this cut on it for a few days now. It was kind of swollen and kind of  infected. You cannot just assume, "Oh, this little cut, it's okay. So  what, we're living in a damp, nasty cave with rats and bats around us every  15 minutes. No, this'll be fine."  <br/>I just did three loops around the island looking for your  ass.  <br/>Who are you talking to?  <br/>You. Where were you? Oh, my God! I need to do some serious  damage control today. James and Amanda are pissed at me, furious for voting  Oz out. But I made my bed. I have to lie in it. I knew as soon as I made this  move, things were going to get crazy.  <br/>Where are you going with this?  <br/>Where am I going with what?  <br/>The paranoia got to you and you just made a big  move.  <br/>What?  <br/>I mean, you'll be all right.  <br/>I couldn't win against Ozzy. I would be a fool to have  kept him in the game.  <br/>What is your plan? Who are you taking with you? I'm just  curious to know.  <br/>To three?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Girls.  <br/>Yeah, I figured that.  <br/>I just wanted to say sorry because I couldn't tell  you.  <br/>No, sorry's not what you mean. Ha-ha's what you  mean.  <br/>Well, I wanted to talk to you, because I like you. I  didn't want it to be, like, completely awkward.  <br/>Oh, it's going to be awkward. It's just funny. There's  always one that always got to eat the apple, can't just leave the apple alone  and just enjoy the heavens. No, you got to chew on that apple.  <br/>Yeah, hopefully, because you wouldn't give me credit for  having a plan anyways.  <br/>Why would I think that?  <br/>Because that's pretty much how you've been acting towards  me this whole time.  <br/>That's a lie.  <br/>That I'm stupid.  <br/>No, I didn't say you were stupid. I said you were selfish,  not stupid. I mean, you can lie to me, you can fool me, you can deceive  don't. Don't insult your intelligence. Don't try to act like you're going to  pull the wool over my eyes with self-pity. Just don't come up here trying to  give me a bunch of bluff.  <br/>I just wanted to talk to you, honestly.  <br/>Huh?  <br/>I just wanted to talk to you.  <br/>And you have. By her pulling that just showed me who she  really is. Do I put up with people like that? No. That's what kind of person  she is, and that's who we're dealing with, and I just can't stand it.  <br/>I feel really bad that I couldn't tell you last night. I  know, like, you feel really out of the loop, but, like, you're not.  <br/>What is the plan?  <br/>I'm thinking...  <br/>Because obviously it's the girls together, right?  <br/>I'm thinking final five girls, you know?  <br/>I don't want Parvati to know that I'm mad at her, because  Parvati is pretty much running the show at this point. She has Natalie and  Alexis wrapped around her finger, and Cirie didn't even tell me that she was  voting for Ozzy. So she's got little Cirie wrapped around her finger. You  know, I just hope that we're all still cool.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>That's what I'm coming down here for, because I can tell  you're not happy.  <br/>I understand. Like, I really understand.  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>I hope you guys trust me.  <br/>No, no, we totally trust you. It's just with Ozzy and not  wanting him... we knew you probably didn't want him to go just yet.  <br/>So is it still, like, us three to the end?  <br/>I say yeah.  <br/>I don't see why not.  <br/>Okay, yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>All right.  <br/>You know I love you, "Legs." Oh, I feel so bad  for you. You look so sad.  <br/>You know, I'd like to believe them, but obviously, they  have other plans right now that I'm not aware of, and it'd be stupid of me to  buy what they're telling me right now. This is where the game gets  interesting.  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Always smiles at the Survivor  auction. Welcome to the Survivor auction. ( applause )  <br/>Woo!  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: You each received a wallet with $500. Today,  you're going to use that money to bid on items. The bidding will be in $20  increments. There is no sharing of money or items.  <br/>Oh.  <br/>Ouch.  <br/>Probst: Shall we get started?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: First item.  <br/>I'll take 20.  <br/>40.  <br/>60.  <br/>Probst: 60 to Parvati.  <br/>80.  <br/>100.  <br/>120, Jeff.  <br/>Probst: Going once, twice, sold to Cirie. Let me count  this. ( laughter )  <br/>Oh, I forgot.  <br/>Probst: Yeah, nice. ( laughter )  <br/>No, she didn't!  <br/>Probst: You want to see what $120 buy you?  <br/>I hope it's good.  <br/>Hot dog, French fries, and all the fixings.  <br/>I'm so mad at you. I can't even look at you.  <br/>Ooh, it smells good. Ooh, it's a fat one!  <br/>Probst: Next item, covered.  <br/>20.  <br/>Probst: 20 to Alexis.  <br/>40.  <br/>Probst: 40 to Erik.  <br/>60.  <br/>Probst: 60 to Alexis.  <br/>I'll say 80.  <br/>Probst: $80 to Erik. Going once, going twice, sold for  $80. Hang tight. Before you get up, Erik, you can keep this or...  <br/>Window number two.  <br/>Oh.  <br/>Ah, it's another one!  <br/>Probst: You can trade it for this.  <br/>I'll trade it.  <br/>Probst: You're going to trade it.  <br/>Yeah, I'll trade it.  <br/>Probst: All right. Come on up.  <br/>All right.  <br/>Probst: Right here, 80 bucks.  <br/>80.  <br/>Probst: All right, Erik, this is what you bought for 80  bucks. You gave up octopus...  <br/>All right!  <br/>Yes!  <br/>Probst: ...for a huge tray of nachos.  <br/>Oh, nachos!  <br/>That's good! Damn, I want that one!  <br/>Oh, my God, there's guacamole.  <br/>Probst: Next item, going to stay covered.  <br/>240.  <br/>Probst: Sold to Natalie.  <br/>It'd better be good. Please, let it be good.  <br/>Probst: Fruit bat soup.  <br/>Ah.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Probst: Not even interested.  <br/>I'll eat it.  <br/>Probst: You want it?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: James, all yours. Take a bite of that for  me.  <br/>You got to take the skin off first. That's the secret. You  get past the skin, you're all right.  <br/>Probst: Free food. Peanut butter jelly sandwich.  <br/>20.  <br/>40.  <br/>60.  <br/>80.  <br/>140.  <br/>Probst: That's to Amanda.  <br/>160.  <br/>Probst: That's 160 to Alexis.  <br/>180.  <br/>200.  <br/>Probst: 200 to Alexis.  <br/>220... 240.  <br/>Probst: 240 to Amanda.  <br/>260.  <br/>Probst: 260 to Parvati.  <br/>280.  <br/>Probst: Wow, 280 to Amanda for a peanut butter and jelly.  Sold! It's amazing the value you put on food when you don't have it. All  right, next item.  <br/>100.  <br/>Probst: 100 to Alexis.  <br/>Two.  <br/>Probst: 200 to Natalie.  <br/>220.  <br/>240.  <br/>Probst: 240 to Natalie. Going once, twice, sold to  Natalie. $240 bought you this.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Probst: It's a bottle with a note. Open it and read  it.  <br/>"You must choose one person to go to Exile Island  immediately, and you take all of the money they have left."  <br/>Damn!  <br/>I've been there twice. I don't want to go back.  Please!  <br/>Well, is the idol replanted since it wasn't ever  played?  <br/>Probst: Because Ozzy was voted out while in possession of  the idol and he never played it, that idol is dead. A new idol has been  hidden. New clues await.  <br/>Um... Jason.  <br/>Ah.  <br/>Probst: Jason going to Exile Island.  <br/>But this is also good for Jason, if he gets the immunity  idol. Like, I don't know why he's tripping.  <br/>Probst: That's true. This time maybe you'll get a real  one. All right, Jason, give your money to Natalie. You can head out the same  way you came in. The boat's waiting for you.  <br/>Bye, Jason.  <br/>Bye, kid.  <br/>Probst: Next item, this item comes with another  layer.  <br/>20.  <br/>40.  <br/>60.  <br/>80.  <br/>100.  <br/>Stop playing, Parvati. 200.  <br/>240.  <br/>Probst: 240 to Parvati.  <br/>Three.  <br/>320.  <br/>340.  <br/>360.  <br/>380.  <br/>Probst: 380 to Natalie.  <br/>Damn it!  <br/>Probst: Going once, twice, sold to Natalie. Looks like  Jason's cash just came in very handy.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Probst: A gigantic chocolate cake for Natalie. Now, I said  this item has another layer to it.  <br/>What the hell is that?  <br/>Probst: It's a note. Turn around and read it to the  group.  <br/>Oh, not that again.  <br/>Okay. "You must share this cake with three of your  tribe mates. You have 60 seconds to eat as much as you can." Parvati and  Alexis and Cirie. Okay. Seriously, don't hog the cake. I haven't had any  food.  <br/>No way.  <br/>I'm a little aggro right now, okay?  <br/>Probst: All right, you three stay there. You get the first  taste.  <br/>Oh, my God. Do it right, mama! Yeah! Yeah!  <br/>Probst: All right, guys, come get this. Sit down. I'll  tell you when your 60 seconds starts. Don't eat yet. Go back over there. You  guys ready? 60 seconds starts now. Go.  <br/>Go!  <br/>Mm!  <br/>I'll give them 20 bucks each to lick their fingers when  they're done.  <br/>Mm!  <br/>Probst: You have 15 seconds left. You better start shoving  cake down. Whatever is in your mouth you can finish. Everything else you've  got to drop. Five seconds, four, three, two, one, and you're done.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Awesome!  <br/>That's just too much chocolate. I'm sorry.  <br/>Erik?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>How much did you say you were going to pay?  <br/>I'd say 20 bucks to lick your fingers.  <br/>20 a finger?  <br/>All right, how about 40 bucks to lick your fingers?  <br/>He's serious!  <br/>Okay, uh-huh.  <br/>Oh, baby.  <br/>"Oh, baby."  <br/>Oh, that's sad.  <br/>Mm, mm, mm.  <br/>Something's wrong with that boy. He really has problems,  poor thing.  <br/>Probst: The Survivor auction is over.  <br/>Like, I should not have sent him, but I didn't think  anybody else wanted to miss out.  <br/>I'd have gone.  <br/>I was looking at everybody, and nobody was giving me an  answer.  <br/>I know.  <br/>If he gets that idol, I'm going to lose it. I'm going to  lose it.  <br/>Y'all shouldn't be worried unless he's, like, really good  with clues and puzzles.  <br/>Jason's on Exile. We all want him gone. The little bitch  now has two days of sunshine with the immunity idol. Guaranteed, hands down,  bitch will find it, and that bitch being Jason.  <br/>Hey, I'm not kidding. I say we check his bag when he gets  back-- like, immediately, because it'll come just in his pants.  <br/>Definitely, like, the second we see him.  <br/>Yes! He has been on the biggest lucky streak I have ever  seen of anyone. If there was a lottery right now, he'd be winning it.  <br/>Well, it'd better rain. Like, if I want rain at all, it's  tonight.  <br/>Seriously.  <br/>"To find the idol that you seek, go north to a  familiar location. You must step up but look for cracks to find your  destination." Well, doesn't seem too hard. Go down there. If my time out  here goes similar to my last time out here finding the fake hidden immunity  idol, you know, I should find it in a breeze. Number two. So far, the game  has thrown me so many curves balls. But since stepping down from the last  immunity challenge, I think things have definitely changed for me out here. I  was a little bummed right away when Natalie chose me, but hopefully Natalie  sent me out to Exile Island so that I could find it in the event that Natalie  and I might work together in using the hidden immunity idol. Okay, back  across the waterway there. I believe that I can trust Natalie in the fact  that, one, she kept her word to me at last tribal council when we voted out  Ozzy, and it's in her best interest to keep me along in this game. There you  go. Oh! Yes! I feel pretty stupid falling for the fact that Ozzy made me a  fake idol. This is not the fake hidden immunity idol, and the decision of  Natalie to send me to Exile Island was a strategic move on her part. I feel  like for the first time in the game, I'm actually part of a successful  alliance. Right now I feel the most comfortable I've felt in the entire game.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>You know, we have to act as if Jason has the idol.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>We need to have a plan.  <br/>As far as the idol goes, like, I don't want anything  bouncing off and getting one of us.  <br/>I mean, if Jason doesn't win tomorrow, cool, as  planned.  <br/>Right, but just in case he has the idol, we still have to  split the vote.  <br/>Even if we can convince him that someone else needs to win  this challenge besides him, let's do it. Like, whatever we need to do.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>We have to get into his head, or else I don't think he's  going to lose.  <br/>Yeah, I agree. I think we can get in his head.  <br/>He won't buy anything I say to him, so...  <br/>Nat can say it. I know he'll believe Nat.  <br/>We've concocted a beautiful plan to disarm Jason's lack of  trust, make him feel comfortable, make him feel comfortable enough. So we  want to blindside him with not using his immunity and allowing one of us to  win; therefore, he doesn't win, and he's out. Worst-case scenario, he has to  play his idol, and he stays, but at least his idol's up and out. You know,  before the next immunity, as soon as I see Jason, be like, "Dude, I  saved your ass once. I basically gave you the immunity idol. You owe  me."  <br/>That's all you have to say.  <br/>I just think that it's similar to Ozzy in the sense that  we have one chance to blindside him.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>At this point, Jason would be an idiot not to believe  anything I say. He thinks that I'm warming up to him, which I am absolutely  not. If this goes, I mean, this will just be brilliant, because not only will  it happen... have happened once with Ozzy; it'll happen twice, back to back,  girls against the guys. ( laughter )  <br/>That's, like, freaking...  <br/>Genius!  <br/>...genius.  <br/>Hell hath no furry.  <br/>"Deja vu, this may feel familiar. Don't panic, but  still you'd better hurry. If you haven't learned from the past, you may be  the next to join the jury." Hmm.  <br/>Got to win.  <br/>Got to win. It's day 30. It's my 22nd birthday, and I  really think I need to compete well this time. If Jason wins immunity today,  I have a feeling that it's either me or James on the chopping block for  tribal council, simply because the women are very strong right now. I really  need to get ferocious on this. I really need to try my best, because I feel  like I could be gone on my birthday, and that would be terrible. Big, green  birthday present.  <br/>Happy birthday.  <br/>Happy birthday.  <br/>I wish we had stuff we could give you.  <br/>I know. I do too.  <br/>He's like, "Tell me about it."  <br/>Hey, babe.  <br/>This challenge is vital in all the other steps leading up  to the end of this game for the girls.  <br/>What else is in there, Nat, anything?  <br/>No key, I hope.  <br/>A key and a chain.  <br/>Oh, no.  <br/>A lock and chain. I don't want to do any diving.  <br/>If all goes to plan, Jason will feel comfortable enough  not to play his idol and he will not win immunity today. So he's done.  Worst-case scenario, James goes home tonight in lieu of Jason, if we can't  get Jason. So it's either James or Jason tonight. And as evil as women can be  and diabolical and cutthroat and go for the jugular as women are and just  suck blood, we do want Erik to have a good birthday on day 30. Today's his  birthday. He's 22. So he's not going home today.  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Jason,  returning from Exile Island.  <br/>How was the line? Be honest.  <br/>Welcome back.  <br/>Hi, guys.  <br/>Howdy.  <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's immunity  challenge?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: First things first. Parvati, take back the  necklace. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,  all eight of you will race to throw rocks at tiles. When you break your tile,  you'll drop a bundle of puzzle pieces. The first four to break their tile  move on to the next round, where you will dig for a key to unlock the puzzle  pieces. You'll then assemble the wheel, place it onto a winch, then spin the  wheel to lower a set of two planks. The first two to lower their planks move  on to the final round, where you will use those planks to cross a rope  bridge. You'll then make your way across a series of discs and to the finish  platform. First person to the platform wins immunity, is guaranteed at least  one more day in this game. Losers, tribal council, somebody going home. Draw  for spots. We'll get started.  <br/>Probst: Here we go. This is for immunity. The first four  people to break their tile move on to the next round. Survivors ready? Go!  Yellow's in. Jason's moving on. Erik's moving on. James is moving on. We're  looking for one more person, and it is Amanda. Amanda, James, Erik, and Jason  moving on to the next round. Here we go. The first two to lower their planks  and cross the black line move on to the final. Survivors ready? Go! You're  looking for a key, one key. James has his key. Erik has his key. James and  Erik both have their keys. Got to unwrap them, then unlock those puzzle  pieces. Jason's found his key. He's working on it. James has his lock undone.  Amanda is still digging.  <br/>Hey, where is it?  <br/>Probst: Erik has his lock open. James working on the  puzzle, has it together quickly. Erik working on his puzzle. James and Erik  both lowering their planks. Two people are moving on. Amanda still digging  for that key. Jason trying to get his puzzle together, quickly falling out of  it. Got to hit the table. James, you're good! James unclips. James moving on.  Erik, you're good. Erik unclips and moving on. James and Erik moving on to  the final. Here we go. It is James and Erik for immunity. Survivors ready?  Go! Got to make your way across using your planks. Very different strategies.  James trying to go sideways, trying to keep his balance, and it doesn't work.  James is in. Got to go back to the start.  <br/>Don't knock Erik over. You're going to knock him  over.  <br/>Probst: James loses his plank, got to get back, losing a  lot of time. James tried a strategy that did not work. Erik doing something  similar, going from the side, but he's using his knees. James trying a new  strategy, struggling to hang on. Erik not panicking at all, taking his time,  keeping that lead. Immunity and a one-in-seven shot for the winner of this  challenge. Erik doing a good job of going slow and easy. James is in the role  of having to move quickly, try and make up ground, take some risks. He's  gaining on Erik. Erik now going back to riskier moves. Instead of one plank  at a time, he's skipping. James making up some ground again.  <br/>...the rest of the way.  <br/>Probst: James is back in it.  <br/>Oh, oh, oh, oh.  <br/>Probst: Erik getting very close. Erik to the platform. Now  he's got to make his way across the discs. James to the platform. James has  got to get across the discs. First to the pole. Erik wins immunity! (  applause )  <br/>Damn.  <br/>Happy birthday!  <br/>Woo!  <br/>Probst: Erik, come on up.  <br/>Nice job, Erik.  <br/>Probst: A round of applause. Congratulations. Erik safe  tonight at tribal council. For the rest of you, somebody is going home  tonight. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at tribal.  <br/>Birthday boy. Hey, Erik, it's your birthday. One out of  eight. I keep telling you. You won on your birthday.  <br/>I was telling them, what are the odds, honestly?  <br/>That's awesome. I'm proud of you. That was a tough one  too.  <br/>I thought so.  <br/>I'm going to get a puff ball or two, maybe bring it into  the cave. ( Parvati squealing )  <br/>So far, part A of the plan is perfect.  <br/>I looked over at Parvati, and we were like, "Run,  Erik!"  <br/>I was so nervous. I was hyperventilating. I was  like...  <br/>When Erik made it, I jumped up like... I didn't scream,  though.  <br/>So the fact that it came down to Erik and James in the  end, and we needed Erik to win in order for the plan to work out, and then  Erik did win, I was ecstatic. I think all the girls were jumping up and down  and screaming silently inside their heads.  <br/>The plan is in play.  <br/>The plan is in play. ( laughter ) It's like the black  widow brigade. Like, all the girls are coming together, and we're spinning  the guys around as much as we can, just spinning them and spinning them,  until they don't know which way is up, and then we're devouring them one at a  time.  <br/>Are you going to go look for... what are you going to go  do?  <br/>Yeah, I'm going to go look for crab too, in a little  bit.  <br/>It's raining. They're not out when it rains.  <br/>And bring back some salt water.  <br/>You want to take that bucket? Or you're going to take the  pot.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>I'll look in the nets too.  <br/>He didn't go anywhere but right here, right?  <br/>He went down there.  <br/>I mean, he came straight up here. Where is his stuff at? I  don't know. Where's the bag? Oh, the bag is over there too. Hurry up,  Nat.  <br/>It's in here.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>It's in here.  <br/>Grab it.  <br/>It's it.  <br/>That's the stuff.  <br/>I knew he had it. Because he was like, "I know you  sent me for strategy purposes."  <br/>He won't play it tonight. He won't play it tonight.  <br/>I told him I would go into everything a little bit later.  But I'm like, "This is done." He's like, "Oh." He's like,  "You sent me for a reason, huh?" I was like, "Yeah." I  was able to have a conversation with Jason at the challenge, literally 30  seconds, hopefully got my point across in one swift motion. So I think we're  good. It would be perfect, it would be brilliant for Jason to go out just  like Ozzy-- blindsided, no idea that it's... what's hitting him in the face.  I'd love it.  <br/>And, yeah, we can use it however... because I wanted to  say to you personally, I didn't get a chance to yesterday, you know, but  thank you for keeping your word, and it means a lot to me, and you have mine  in this game from now on, so...  <br/>Cool, cool, thank you. So yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Uh, the thing is... here's the thing. James is going home  tonight.  <br/>Is that what you're thinking?  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>That'd be great. And yeah, to let you know, I did find it.  And... yeah, like that. ( snaps fingers )  <br/>Yeah. Did you see me ask Jeff. I was like, "So is the  immunity idol back out?"  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>And he was like, "Oh, by the way,  da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da." And you were like this, and I'm like,  "And... Jason."  <br/>I know, I know. But it was smart. It was very smart of you  to send me. I'm hoping that Natalie is telling the truth, that we're voting  for James tonight. She kept her word to me at last tribal council, when we  voted out Ozzy, and you know, I'm going to have to trust her this tribal  council as well. After what you guys did for me last time, my word is as good  as your word, which, you know, so far in this game, has been good,  so...  <br/>You know, I think I'm pretty evil. I think I could be  pretty evil. What I am now is I'm definitely in "I will get you" mode.  I'm in game mode. And now I'm actually having a lot more fun. I'm getting to  be more of myself, which is proving to be pretty ruthless and pretty  stone-cold bitch and pretty cutthroat. And I have a smile on my face. Sorry  about that.  <br/>I have, like, searched every avenue. I'm telling you, I  don't know what to do. I honestly have no idea. You know what? If it's not  him, I mean, they're writing your name down.  <br/>Who is?  <br/>You are?  <br/>Yeah. Because I'm saying maybe you could too, but... you  think?  <br/>That'd be awesome.  <br/>Yeah. I wouldn't mind.  <br/>I get really, unbelievably fourth grade uncomfortable  when, like, any guy even remotely makes a move. Like, I'm not the cool girl  at all.  <br/>Really?  <br/>Really, really.  <br/>See, I'm like a man eater now. I'm like,  "You..."  <br/>Man eater! ( laughter )  <br/>I'd love to blindside Jason, because it would be 2-0, the  ladies, just at the jugular, flossing my teeth with his jugular. Either way,  it's a win-win. Either Jason goes home, or Jason stays and unearths the idol,  or it's James going home. Either way, it's still the five girls down to two  guys. Picking them off... one by one.  <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of the jury. So  last tribal council, you not only vote out one of the strongest physical  threats in this game, but you vote out one of the biggest providers. Parvati,  does this group feel like we don't really need providers anymore?  <br/>I think we've all felt kind of okay on our own as far as  providing for ourselves for a while. Like, every person is kind of  providing.  <br/>Probst: James, seeing that they don't need providers  anymore, another big physical threat in this game is you.  <br/>Yeah, it don't look that good for James right now. The  social butterflies have done their work, and yeah, I'm definitely on the  chopping block.  <br/>Probst: How frustrating would it be to be voted out  tonight, James, after everything you've done in terms of keeping this tribe  afloat?  <br/>It was all about trying not to make certain people eat  that apple. You know, and if somebody want to be greedy-- Parvati, she want  to make herself in a better position, so she did what she had to do. She got  rid of Ozzy. And now I'm pretty much next, you know, and it's very  frustrating. I mean, I could try to politic, but I really suck at that. So, I  mean, what can you do?  <br/>Probst: Erik, looking at physical threats, obviously,  you're a physical threat. It's got to feel great to have immunity.  <br/>I couldn't agree more with that. I mean, I felt like I was  in the same position as James: if I didn't win, then I was going home. And if  everybody feels like they can provide for themselves, that's one more reason  why you don't need Erik around.  <br/>Probst: The other significant thing about the last vote is  that you're still here, Jason. Has your social standing in this game truly  changed as a result of stepping down off that immunity challenge?  <br/>Yeah. Every little difference I make around camp is  changing my social standing in this game. But I was sent away to Exile, where  I was gone for two days. So you know, it's difficult to say where I stand in  the tribe right now.  <br/>Probst: You say you're not sure because you were sent to  Exile Island. Two sides to that coin. It could be a sentence to go there. It  could be an opportunity.  <br/>It was an opportunity for me to look for the idol, but at  this point in the game, I wanted to stay with my tribe mates and really, you  know, show them that I can make these differences. So you know, I'll have to  see how it plays out.  <br/>Probst: Natalie, is it possible to change your standing in  the game that quickly?  <br/>Absolutely. It's constantly changing, constantly.  <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. Erik, you have  the immunity necklace, unless you want to do something crazy and give it to  somebody else.  <br/>I'm not crazy. I think I'm going to keep it.  <br/>Probst: Erik is safe tonight. You cannot vote for Erik.  Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. Amanda you're up.  <br/>James, you played a good game. Unfortunately, Parvati got  you in the end.  <br/>You couldn't just frolic naked and enjoy the heavens. You  had to eat the damn apple.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden  immunity idol, and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay,  once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be  asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes.  First vote, James. Jason. One vote James, one vote Jason. James. Two votes  James, one vote Jason. Parvati. Two votes James, one vote Jason, one vote  Parvati. James. That's three votes James, one vote Jason, one vote Parvati.  Jason. That's two votes Jason, three votes James, one vote Parvati. Jason.  That's three votes Jason, three votes James, one vote Parvati. One vote left.  11th person voted out of Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites and the third member of  our jury, Jason. That's four. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.  Jason, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Well, after  back-to-back blindsides, anybody who still feels safe is a fool. James, on  your way out, I want medical to look at your finger. Everybody else, grab your  torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

The first clue awaits  you at Exile Island.  <br/>That's Jeff Probst! He's just standing there!  <br/>I was definitely played today by Natalie and the rest of  the girls. They did the same thing in voting out Ozzy. I should have been a  little more wary of what they were telling me. What they did tonight will  definitely come back to haunt them as I'm sitting up there on the jury. I  just wish I would have been a little smarter and played the hidden immunity  idol when I had the chance.
