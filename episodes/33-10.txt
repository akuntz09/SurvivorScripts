<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," there are three  idols in play, held by Adam, David and Jay. <br/>It's between me and you. <br/>Jeff: After the merge, Chris, Bret and Sunday saw Jessica  as the biggest threat. <br/>I’m worried about jess. <br/>Jeff: But the majority had already made their decision. <br/>It's the safest bet to split the votes between Taylor and Jay. <br/>This is the last meal. <br/>Jeff: With little hope left, Taylor revealed Adam's  secret. <br/>Adam has an advantage in this game. <br/>Jeff: But the tribe couldn't forgive him for stealing  food. <br/>You ate it? <br/>Me and Jay ate it because we thought you were voting us  out. <br/>Jeff: Sending him to the jury. Taylor, the prescribe has spoKen. 11 are left, who will be voted out tonight? 11 are left, who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Man, that was some tribal, huh? <br/>That was insane. <br/>If I can just say, I am very sorry to all of you for not  telling you. It was not possible because Taylor knew about the advantage that  I didn't want to reveal to the group yet. <br/>Taylor stole food from us, that's why he's gone. Let's look at the bigger picture here. <br/>Oh, man, Taylor and Jay dragged my name through the mud,  and now everybody knows about my advantage. I want Jay out of this game so badly I can taste his blood in my  mouth. <br/>Is there any food left from the feast hidden somewhere? <br/>I do know where it is. He said he proved -- moved it. <br/>Well, I don't know. <br/>Dude, so I’m in tribal council just thinking, tails, stop  talking, dude, you're burying me with you. Not only are you going out, but now you're making sure I go out  next. How am I going to clean this up? So I unbury the food just as good faith, hey, here's the food,  this is what's left and I’m going to be honest. <br/>You found it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Because now my back is literally up against the wall. Literally. But considering the fact that I have not used my idol this whole  time, perfect because now they really think I don't have one. <br/>I don't care. <br/>He stole food. <br/>Did anybody not know he was a complete moron? <br/>Taylor leaving was my goal. Taylor left. Next move, let's go. Jay is seemingly on the bottom, but he's not right now in my  opinion. <br/>Let's get real, you understand that? <br/>Oh, yeah, I know. <br/>Well, I know what to do. We have to get rid of Jay, you know what I mean? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's got to be Jeff. 90% of it is jess is a strategic player. 10% is I owe her one more blind siding Paulie in my alliance. If I don't hit her first, she's going to hit me. We have to have six solid. Me, you, Sunday...  We should definitely do this, but we got to tiptoe. <br/>Big time. <br/>This is a small tactical squad that's got to go in and  take out jess. If it's the last thing I do, I will vote her out. <br/>Sunset was nice, but sunrise...  Beautiful. <br/>It's hard to have a bad day after that, you know? <br/>In "Survivor," you've got to find a way to  connect with someone who is drastically different from you, and I do flirt  with Ken. I just... You look at Ken, and you're like, Ken, Ken wouldn't  have any sort of crush on me, because look like at him. <br/>For a few seconds you can look at the sun and it doesn't  hurt your eyes. <br/>But maybe, just maybe, yeah, Ken and I, yeah, no,, yeah, I  could... I could... I could see that. <br/>How are you feeling this morning? <br/>I didn't even know where  the vote was supposed to end up. I figured it was Taylor, but I didn't know for sure. Obviously you have more information than me at this point  because I wasn't a part of that big alliance. <br/>Yeah. So David, Chris and I brought together the big votes that we've  been seeing, right, because we each have our people. <br/>Yep. <br/>But now, you know...  Now the game heats up. <br/>I’m done working with Jay. It's time to jump off the sinking ship on the a life raft. And that life raft's name is Zeke. <br/>Now that you are letting me in on all this, there is  something I have to tell you, Jay does have an idol. We found it together on ika bula, but if anybody else finds out  and that gets back to Jay, then I’m screwed. So that's me giving up information...  No, that's good. <br/>I want to give up  information to really solidify this right now that you and Hannah are my  alliance right now. <br/>Good, we're 100%. Thank you for telling me. <br/>Telling Zeke that Jay has the idol is a way to build trust  between Zeke and I. Just don't say anything. <br/>I won't. <br/>I know you won't. <br/>But I don't want to tell too many people. But telling one individual who I need to build trust with  definitely doesn't hurt my game. If anything it only helps my game. <br/>He told me Jay does have an idol. <br/>That's good to know. <br/>Jay does have an idol. <br/>Did you hear what will told Zeke? <br/>No, what? <br/>Jay has an idol. <br/>We know Jay has an idol? <br/>I can confirm Jay does  have an idol. <br/>Yeah, he does have an idol. <br/>Will told Zeke that Jay has an idol. <br/>Jay has an idol? <br/>That's coming from will? <br/>Yeah. <br/>He's turning out to be kind of handy. <br/>I need to have the most  power in the game. Everything in "Survivor" is about relationships. There is no better way to build trust with an ally than there is  no better way to build trust with an ally than revealing the location of a  hidden immunity idol. On top of that, a person with a hidden immunity idol has a major  advantage in this game, but if everybody knows that they have it, that  advantage decreases significantly. If we have a misinformation campaign and make someone else feel  like the target. <br/>Knock jess out. <br/>That's fine. I think we do knock jess out. <br/>But we got to keep the blind side between six or seven  people and leave it be. <br/>Look, Hannah and will, got 'em on the line. You got your people. <br/>Right. <br/>Keep our eye on the prize. <br/>Boom. Let's do it. <br/>Yeah, buddy. <br/>We want to get Jay to think he's the next one to go so he  plays the hidden immunity idol, but in actuality, Chris wants to vote out  jess. You now, we've had these two nice votes, a lot of people voting  together. But now the time has come to turn on each other. The opening shots have been fired and the war is about to get  bloody. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>Jeff: All right. You guys ready for today's reward challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge you're going to be divided  into two teams of five. On my go you'll swim out to a raft and work together to pull  yourself to a platform. You'll climb up a ladder, retrieve a key, slide down a pole and  race to shore. Once you have all your keys, you will unlock a set of blocks and  then stack them so that there are no repeating colors on any side. First team to finish wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: It is a floating pizza restaurant that will be  anchored 50 yards outside your camp where you can enjoy pizza, chicKen wings,  cold beer. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: While the losers sit at camp so close they can  almost smell it, so far they'll never taste it. <br/>That's messed up, Jeff, but I love it. <br/>Jeff: That's "Survivor," brother. <br/>Yeah, it is. <br/>Jeff: We're going to draw randomly for team, which means  one person will not be on a team. <br/>Okay. <br/>I think everybody would  feel that I’m such a crappy swimmer, nobody wants me on their team, right? <br/>David, don't do that. <br/>Jeff: Are you already bailing out of this challenge? <br/>It's just that I don't have a lot of confidence in my  swimming ability, and I don't want people to blame me for them missing out on  pizza and beer. <br/>You can do it, dude. <br/>Never give up. <br/>Don't do that. <br/>Jeff: David, what does it feel like to feel that support? Because I don't think ever in 33 seasons of "Survivor"  anybody has said I'll sit out because I don't want to wring you guys down,  then havana rest of the group saying, you can do it, man, don't give up. <br/>Um...  Oh. <br/>It feels really good. These guys have really been helping me deal with my anxiety and  fear, and I'll never for...  You're good, man. <br/>You're good, dude. <br/>I'll never forget the support that they've given me, like  game or no game, I'll never forget it. That said, I do not want to be...  Choose a rock, brother. <br/>Jeff: Everybody's picking rocks. All right. Let's do it. All right. We have our two teams. It is Ken, Jessica, Chris, David and will taking on Bret, Zeke, Sunday,  Hannah and Adam. Jay picked the odd rock. He will not compete. Here we go. For reward, Survivors ready in go! You got to get to that raft and then pull yourself in. Everybody's got to be on the raft. <br/>Go! <br/>Go! <br/>Jeff: Orange is starting to pull. It takes a lot of teamwork to move that raft. Ken, Jessica, Chris, will and David with a slight lead. Got to get everybody to that platform before you can start  working on the keys. Now you've got to untie five keys. Go, orange! Purple now slowing down. Got to get everybody on that platform. Ken up first for orange. Ken's got a key. He drops it. He's got to go back and get it. <br/>Come get it, come get it. <br/>Jeff: Purple now at their platform. Hannah is going to go up first. <br/>Don't drop it. <br/>Jeff: Ken's got his key. <br/>Take your time. You got it. Go ahead, Hannah. <br/>Good job, Hannah. <br/>Jeff: Hannah has her key. Ken lost a lot of time. <br/>Good work, Hannah. <br/>Jeff: Go! It's Jessica now. Here comes Hannah. You got to get all the way up, Hannah. Put it on the reef. It is now Sunday going up for purple. Jessica now has a key. Quickly down that pole. <br/>Come on, Sunday. <br/>Jeff: Sunday has a key. <br/>That's it, Sunday. <br/>Let's go, Sunday. <br/>Jeff: A big fall by Sunday. <br/>You're all right. <br/>Jeff: It is now Chris heading up the ladder for orange. Sunday is struggling in the water. <br/>Come on, Chris. <br/>Jeff: Chris has his third key. Sunday taking a long time with that second key. Go! Adam is now going up for purple. Chris is sprinting through the sand. A huge effort by Chris. Go! Will is heading up. <br/>Good job, will. <br/>That's it, that's it. <br/>Jeff: Adam has a key now. Orange with a one-person lead right now. <br/>That's it, come on. <br/>Jeff: Adam fighting through the water. Now he's got to track down that key. He's got it. Will has a key for orange. Adam back with the third key. Go! It's now Zeke heading up for purple. Will back with the fourth key. Go! David the last one to go for his team. <br/>You got this. Come on, dave! <br/>Come on, dave. <br/>Jeff: Zeke working on untying the key. David untying the key. Zeke heading down the pole. David down the pole. No problem. <br/>Come on, dave. <br/>Jeff: Get those legs up, let's go, Zeke. David finally in the water. He has the last key for his team. <br/>Excellent. <br/>I'll do first key. <br/>Jeff: Go! It is now Bret up for purple looking for that fifth and final  key. You're looking to unlock four locks right now. <br/>Come on, Bret! <br/>Let's go, Bret. <br/>Jeff: Ken working on that first lock, and he's got it. Chris now working on the second one. Go. Now Zeke going for that first lock for purple. Orange already has one. Chris has the second lock for orange. <br/>That one. <br/>Jeff: Zeke has the first one for purple. Quickly the third lock. Here comes David. Demand still working on that second lock. David has the fourth lock released. That was quick. Adam finally has it. Orange can now take those blocks up and start stacking them. Sunday now working on that third lock for purple. It is David and Chris. You don't want any repeating colors on any side stacking those  blocks. <br/>Nice. <br/>Jeff: Sunday has the third lock for purple. <br/>Got it. <br/>Jeff: Chris has the fourth lock. Go, you're good. <br/>Is that good? <br/>Good. <br/>Over here. Over here. <br/>Jeff: It is Zeke and demand trying to make up a lot of  time on the puzzle. David and Chris have had a lot of time to study it and work on  it. If there are any repeating colors, it's not right. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Jeff: David and Chris trying to figure out what is  missing. It's easy to get three, it's getting that fourth one that takes  the work. Is there a pattern? <br/>Next side needs red. <br/>Jeff: Or is it just process of elimination. Zeke and Adam think they have something. <br/>Yes, this looks good. <br/>Jeff: Are they right? <br/>Yes! Yes! <br/>Jeff: This is good. That side is good. Reward! Adam, Zeke, Hannah, Sunday and Bret in a huge come from behind. <br/>Sorry, man. <br/>I’m sorry. <br/>No, no, no. I'm sorry, guys. <br/>Jeff: Zeke, Bret, Adam, Sunday, Hannah, nice afternoon,  pizzeria brought to you. You'll enjoy the works while these guys dream about it. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>This is cool. <br/>Where is the food? <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Nice. <br/>Oh, look at those waves. <br/>Are you kidding me? <br/>Give me the lettuce. I want the lettuce. <br/>This reward is my first reward. I couldn't help it. My body just reacted with elation. I like collapsed into myself in happiness. <br/>We have to be quiet because they're literally right there. <br/>I also felt pretty guilty  because I could see people back at camp, people who you know are hungry, and  I've been on that side of it. <br/>Here's a chicKen wing. <br/>Guys, it's crazy, but sound travels. I'm sure they can hear us. <br/>I’m eating. I don't care right now. <br/>It's just crazy. <br/>I don't care what  everyone else saw back at camp. Rewards are huge for your game because it makes you feel human  again. It's like I was sitting in a bar having a few beers and some  pizza with some friends. <br/>Can you give me a beer. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Plenty of beer for Bret. <br/>I took a beer. <br/>I like the other one  better. <br/>It feels good because Zeke and I really bond. I think that's going to be a big help down the road because he's  been a lot closer with Chris, and I needed that bond. <br/>Zeke, here. <br/>Cheers, brother. <br/>Is this everything you dreamed of? <br/>This is very nice right now, yes. This does not suck. <br/>Everyone, this is for you guys. <br/>Oh. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Got some lettuce. <br/>Thanks. <br/>No way. <br/>Thank you so much. <br/>All right. Everyone take it easy. Take it easy. <br/>To get a letter from home, I don't know that anyone will  ever know what that meant. I'm so dpld we won this one. The other four saw that it meant a lot the me, but they don't  know that my mom was diagnosed with cancer. And one of the hardest parts out here is the fear at any point  it's not going to be good news for me. So every day that I know my mom's doing okay, and every day that  I stay here that I make it further in the game, that I get closer to that  loved one's visit and closer to the end, is another big win. <br/>My dad sent a message. <br/>Wait, let me see. <br/>Nice the hear from family, isn't it? <br/>Just that little piece, it's enough to keep me going. To get me through these last two weeks of the game. <br/>Is everyone ready? <br/>Three, two, one...  It was cool of Jeff to put that right out there in front  of us. <br/>But so goes the game. <br/>So how you holding up, man? <br/>Like pizza and beer is exactly what I was craving, and  I've been craving for days. But you know what... We'll have our own dinner here. <br/>Mentally and emotionally, how you holding up? <br/>I don't want the cry  again. I don't want to talk about it really, but like I really  appreciate your support and everyone's support and you guys have really been  awesome. <br/>Dude, what you've done and what you've accomplished, the  ways that you've evolved, changed, grown since you've been out here,  everybody respects. <br/>I’m on a journey, and  it's about coming out of this game as a better person than the person I walked  in as. My whole life I've had this gigantic fear of death, but over the  years, it became something far worse. It morphed into a fear of life, and that's why I’m here. I'm here like start taking control of my life, and I really  believe that if any experience can give me that power, it's this game of Survivor. Even though I really wanted to win that challenge more than  anything, like it's nice to reconnect with you. We're always going to be good in this game, you and I, okay. I'm still about final three with you. I want to sit next to you there. I trust you, that's why. <br/>You know you can, man. <br/>Ken and I had some alone time. He gives me a sense of confidence within myself. I'm realizing in life and in this game, you have to take control  of your own destiny, and you know what, timing is everything in "Survivor."  but the threesome of Chris, Bret and Sunday is too strong. I'm uncomfortable with how deep in this game they've made it. It's time for me, Jessica and Ken to make a big move right now. <br/>Chris, Bret and Sunday...  They're a threesome. <br/>We got to break that up. <br/>We have to cut off one of their heads. <br/>Three of us vote out Chris. <br/>Oh, yeah, I gotcha. <br/>I think Hannah and Zeke will  vote against Chris. <br/>And Adam. <br/>You're 100% sure on Zeke? <br/>Look, here's the deal...  I’m just telling you what  I see happening. Honestly, if I had to pick anybody in this game that's playing  it the best, it's Zeke, but for this particular vote, I believe that, maybe I’m  wrong, I believe it's in his best interest to get rid of Chris, as well. David wants to vote out Chris, which would be incredible,  because I feel like he's the arch nemesis out here. We had some issues on our initial tribe together. So as far as I’m concerned, Chris needs to go home. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First things first, Ken, I've got to take it back. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to stand on a narrow beam  while balancing a statue with a long pole. At regular intervals you're going the move further away from the  statue, making it more difficult to bounce. If at any point you fall off the beam or your statue drops,  you're out. Last person left standing wins immunity, safe from the vote. Losers go to tribal council where somebody will be the tenth  person voted out and the third member of our jury. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. Let's do this. All right. Everybody has their statue balanced at the end of the pole in  this challenge and it's on. You can push it off or it can fall backward. Either one and you're out. <br/>What about ants crawling on your stomach? <br/>Jeff: Do you have apts right now or daily? <br/>Literally I have ants crawling on me right now. <br/>Jeff: We'll go five minutes in this section and we'll move  a little further away from that statue. All right. Everybody has transitioned to the second staining of this challenge. Now the balance beam is a little more narrow. You're a little further away from the statue, a little more  difficult. We'll go five minutes again in this section. Sunday's pole inching closer and closer to the top of her  statue, but she's still in it. <br/>Oh. <br/>Jeff: Hannah drops. She's first person out of this challenge. No shot at immunity. Have a spot at the bench. And Ken is the second person out of this challenge. We are down to nine. All right. Everybody has now moved back to the third section of this  challenge. The beam just got even narrower, and now you're even further  away from the statue and holding on to more pole. <br/>Ken's ants have moved on to me. <br/>Jeff: Adam with ants and movement. Not a good combo. Nine people still left in this challenge. And no sooner do I say, that we're down to eight. Chris right behind her. Will drops. Will is out of the challenge. Jay, the slightest bit of a slip and Jay is out followed right  behind him by Bret back to back. You have something in your eye? <br/>An ant crawled in there. <br/>Ants proving to be a big nuisance at this challenge. We are down to four, Jessica the only woman left in this  challenge along with Adam, Zeke and David. We are now in the last phase of this challenge. Both of your feet are at the furthest end of the beam and the  most narrow. You're fully extended on a ten-foot bamboo pole. We go now until we have a winner. No more time limits. Zeke quickly in trouble. The statue moving. His pole has dropped now to the very bottom. Here comes the wind. And the wind knocks Adam out. Adam is out and we are down to three. It is Jessica, Zeke, and David. Zeke trying desperately to keep that statue balanced a lot of  movement. Out of nowhere Jessica drops, and we're down to two. She looked so solid. That's how difficult this challenge is and how much toll 28 days  can take on you. It is now Zeke and David. David has proclaimed himself the underdog. Who would have predicted this final two? Zeke very close to dropping again and saves it again. David looking very solid. Don't lose your concentration. Keep doing what you're doing. Let's stay here all day. Zeke back and forth. Teetering dangerously close to dropping. Here comes the wind again. Big gust blowing David's buff nearly off his head but he's still  in it. Zeke drops. David wins individual immunity. <br/>Nice job. <br/>Nice work, David. <br/>Good job, dave. <br/>Jeff: Huge battle between Zeke and David. <br/>All right, David. <br/>Good job, dave. <br/>Great job. I'm proud of you. <br/>Good job, Zeke. <br/>Jeff: David, come on over. <br/>Way to go, David. <br/>Good job, dave. <br/>Jeff: Individual immunity, I got to ask, you came into  this game and you have been so vulnerable about the things you see as flaw,  your inability to swim, you're not as athletic, and yet here you stand with  the most valuable thing around your neck that you earned. <br/>You're going to make me cry again, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: What is it? There are so many people that watch this game and think, I could  never this that. You were one of them. <br/>Yeah, and I’m just trying to like tamper down that voice  in my head that says I can't and start listening to a voice that says I can. <br/>Jeff: David, safe tonight, will live to see day 29, make  it to the final ten. As for the rest of you, somebody will be voted out and become  the third member of our jury. It will not be you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. Congrats. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>This immunity necklace can only be the beginning. It can't be the end. It's a risk to put your foot down, but if I have anything to say  about it, Chris is going to go home. <br/>David, congrats. <br/>Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. <br/>Thank you for all the support. <br/>Nice job, buddy. <br/>Thanks, man. Appreciate it. <br/>So the immunity challenge was today, and I freakin' blew  it, dammit. <br/>Good job, brother. <br/>Amazing job. <br/>Now I have to go the tribal without immunity, and it  freaks me out because I have no idea what's going on. <br/>What's the word? <br/>I don't even know. <br/>Yeah, you do. <br/>Multiple words. <br/>I know I’m one of them. <br/>No one wants to talk to me. All I know is if I feel it in my gut to use this idol, I’m going  to pull it out and throw it out there. <br/>Something in my gut says if we don't get jess out, we're  going to get played. <br/>What we're talking about is we move on jess, but we got to  play it up to Jay that you better play you idol. <br/>Chris and brad are ready to vote out Jessica, and that's  exactly what I wanted to do the last vote because I’m worried literally every  day that she's putting something together to get me out of the game. <br/>Nobody should tell him to play an idol because he'll know  we're trying to flush it. <br/>Well, we are. <br/>Tonight's the night that we finally make a move on jess. My man Zeke and his group are on board, and in a perfect world, Jay  would play his hidden immunity idol tonight. It would be flushed. And jess would go home. <br/>It's written in stone we're going after jess and that's  it. <br/>Well, I’m just making my pitch to you and maybe it winds  up with yours and if not let me know what your is. <br/>I feel like we have to go  after Chris. Chris wants to go after jess, and David wants to go after Chris,  so this is what I am deeming the gen x civil war. I think I feel secure because will will vote with Hannah and I. <br/>This is going to be real easy I think. <br/>I’m tight with Chris, but  if this war starts, I want to have the power and the control. So now it's time to pit the gen xers against each other. You know Chris is coming after jess. <br/>Chris is targeting jess. He's been targeting jess since the beginning of the game. So Jessica's not safe as long as Chris is in this game. <br/>You are next according to Chris, okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>His plan is to vote you out next and get Jay to play his  idol. <br/>I wonder what's going on  between Zeke and Chris. <br/>Nothing. <br/>I have been told point  blank that my name is getting written down by Chris. And that's a scary feeling, because I feel like he's got it out  for me, like he has been gunning for me since the decision to vote Paul out. If I get voted out, I have to give the legacy advantage to  someone else. But that's not happening, because I’m a fighter, and I'll do  whatever I have to do to survive. <br/>Chris is going to be voting for me and not jess. <br/>Okay. <br/>Obviously you, me, Ken, dave are 100%. I do think that Zeke is with us. <br/>I think so, too. <br/>But it's not 100%. <br/>I wish it wasn't coming  to this already. Why can't we just vote out Jay. <br/>We will, but we got the take care of the Chris problem  first. <br/>Right. <br/>The best thing for me is to have Chris go home, but we  need to have Zeke. Tonight I have to trust an enormous amount of people. <br/>What do you think in. <br/>You know, both sides think they're pulling off a blind  side and they don't want to feel like they're...  I know it's a game of trust. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Right now I have what I've always wanted to have, which  are options right? <br/>Two sides think they're pulling off a blind side. <br/>Right. <br/>That's crazy. <br/>And we're trying to flush an idol. My click of nerdy millennials can work with Chris, my buddy, or  I can work with David, and make this huge move. But it's hard for me because like I trust both of these guys. To win this game, you have to know where you're going, and you  have to know who you need to get there. And so this next vote is all about amassing the soldiers I need  to march my army down the field. Need to march my army down the field. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Michelle and Taylor voted out at the last tribal council. So, Jay, pick up from last tribal. The food scandal erupted, Taylor is voted out, that leaves you. <br/>Yeah, today I kind of felt like this loan wolf just  traveling around waiting for a crack to happen or someone to approach, but I’m  still on the outs right now, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: David, did you see that going on in relation to Jay? Because he had to be a central figure in the conversation one  way or the other. <br/>Well, that's an interesting question. There are different voting blocs, so tonight is about whether  the voting blocs decide to unite to eliminate a single threat or there's a  division and multiple targets emerge. So it's predictability versus blind side tonight. <br/>Jeff: Zeke, is voting bloc the right term for what's  happening? <br/>I think we're seeing some  permutation between a voting bloc and alliance, but it's premised upon trust,  just as an alliance is, but it's smaller. <br/>Jeff: Hannah, what is your take? <br/>It's between an alliance and voting bloc. I call it a trust cluster. Voting blocs can be broKen up in the blink of an eye and an alliance  never changes, but a trust cluster is somewhere in between. <br/>Jeff: Bret, where do you weigh in on the trust cluster? [laughter] why do you think that's funny? <br/>It's amazing to hear you say a word I just created. It's the fan in me. <br/>Jeff: Hand narcotic you're fantastic. <br/>I love it. <br/>Jeff: So Bret, do you think there are multiple trust  cluster tonight? <br/>Yeah, Jeff, I do. My thing is the trust part of it. You know, who can I trust going forward in this game and getting  rid of people I can't trust going forward in this game. <br/>Jeff: Chris, where is the game right now from your point  of view? <br/>I think there's a couple  groups, but where are you going to fall trust-wise within those groups? Every vote the line gets drawn again, but trust should not be an  issue tonight. <br/>Jeff: And yet, Adam, tribal after tribal, when I read the  last vote, there's somebody going, oh, my God. Another blind side. <br/>I think it's because, Jeff,  there's sort of a cold war brewing. And the question is: Can we focus on a single threat and Jay  would be one of those people that we're talking about. <br/>Jeff: Jay, backhanded compliment. <br/>Thank you. I know what's happening. Hi. I'm like the biggest target on the board right now, so it's kind  of nerve-racking at the moment. <br/>Jeff: Sunday, where do you think this vote is going to go  tonight? <br/>I think it's more about  who we can't trust than who we can trust at the end of the vote, but the  truth is when you have to trust somebody, the only way you can trust them is  by looking at their past actions. <br/>Jeff: Who here believes they've done something that might  be viewed as a past action that would get them a vote? Okay. So we've got Adam and Jay, and that's the whole food thing. Jessica, what's yours? <br/>I unfortunately had some  run-ins with the gen xers way back when. <br/>Jeff: Chris, she's talking in code. Do you know what Jessica is referring to? <br/>Yeah, she blind sided Bret and Paulie and me, but you have  to have a short memory in this game, so jess has nothing to worry about. <br/>Jeff: David, how certain are you that tonight's vote will  go as you think it's going to go? <br/>I actually feel 100%  certain. Maybe it's because I’m wearing this necklace, but I’m not  worried about tonight's vote. <br/>Jeff: Zeke, David is 100%. Where are you? <br/>100%. <br/>This is fantastic. Sunday, how confident are you? <br/>100%. <br/>Jeff: Chris, 100%? <br/>You bet. <br/>Jay? <br/>I’m 100%, Jeff. I'm sure. I'm ready to go. I have no idea what the hell is going to go on tonight. <br/>Jeff: Zeke, if somebody had approached Jay, the last thing  Jay's going to do is say, yep, I’m some it tonight. <br/>Yes, that's very true. From a group of people who have all participated in blindsides,  we're very good at playing that we can stick to the plan, so appearances are  very deceiving. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Will, you're up. <br/>You still are holding a grudge, regardless of what you  said tonight at tribal. <br/>Just too big a threat. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Chris. Jessica. Chris. Jessica. We're tied, two votes Jessica, two votes Chris. Chris. Jessica. We're tied again. Three votes Jessica, three votes Chris. Chris. That's four votes Chris. Jessica. Tied again. Four votes Jessica, four votes Chris. Chris. That's five votes Chris, four votes Jessica. Tenth person voted out and the third member of our jury, Chris. That's six. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Chris, the tribe has spoKen. <br/>Boomer. <br/>Sooner. <br/>Jeff: Well, alliances, voting bloc, trust clusters,  whatever you call it, this game is being played at a very high level, and  that means one thing: More blind sides to come. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>I was completely blind  sided today. It's disappointing. I wanted to go further in the game, but jess outplayed me, man. I've been going after her for a long time. So I’m just having hard time processing it. But no regrets. I'm coming home to my boys soon, jackson, costner and my wife, I  love you for letting me have the adventure of a lifetime. Love you for letting me have the adventure of a lifetime. <br/>Great move. <br/>Holy crap. I didn't know what the heck was going on. <br/>That's so awesome. At tribal I thought I was going to have the pull my idol. I'm sitting there and no one was really talking about me, don't  use it. It was a million dollar gamble. I was right and my name didn't show up once. <br/>Sorry I wrote your name. <br/>You don't need to apologize. You have no reason to apologize at all. Sending Chris home solidifies things for the group that I trust because  we had a plan and everybody stuck to it, and the next vote should be Jay. <br/>He was totally in control. That move needed to be done, and I’m a huge fan of Chris, but he  would have gone the whole game. <br/>I think that was sort of  the feeling. I want to say I’m sorry that we couldn't have done this  together. In my mind you and Sunday are not on the bottom. <br/>I appreciate hearing  that. I knew you and I had a really good rapport the last couple days. <br/>Tonight's vote went as I anticipated. It was necessary to see Chris go because Chris was in a major  power position. He controlled Bret and Sunday. <br/>I would love to move  forward with you if you'll do it. <br/>I would love that, brad. Let's talk more in the morning. <br/>I saw I was going to need  to make a move against David and his coalition if I’m going to come for David  soon, I need at least six. Bret and Sunday are integral to that six. And I like most of all that I got to them before David did. <br/>Look how calm the water is. <br/>It's beautiful. <br/>I just want to tell you  guy, just because I flipped doesn't mean that I’m like, okay, now you, now  you. <br/>No, no, no. We had to all think about it at some point. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And Chris was my buddy, too. <br/>I know, I know. <br/>He would have won this whole thing. He's a strong prayer. <br/>It's outwith, outlast, outplay. Just do what you can. <br/>I still think Jay should  go, don't you think? The next target? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I want the make Jay the  next vote, but the fact is the person winning this game right now is Zeke. And so I think I need to eliminate Zeke in three votes because I  do want to get rid of Jay. Then will. Then Zeke. <br/>You guys know who is playing the best game right now in. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay. <br/>I have an individual  conversation with everyone in this game, gives up enough information so  people trust him, he's going to win. <br/>Unbeknownst to David, I've signed on with Zeke, because David,  I know he can be trusted. That's why I’m nodding and thinking, David needs to go and he  needs to go fast. <br/>How you feeling this morning? <br/>I feel good, man. One of the things that concerns me is I think David needs to go. He mentioned to me this morning, Zeke's playing the best game, Zeke's  friends with everyone, Zeke needs to go. <br/>Wouldn't you know, I wake up this morning and David has  already started to come for me. It's understandable, right, because I've already started to come  for David. <br/>You know about David, he's got an idol? <br/>I know, because he always  has an idol. If we're going to snuff him, we've got to do it without him  knowing, and that's going to be hard. <br/>I’m the doughy little gay  guy, and a lot of people didn't think I could hack it out here. I think it's developed a toughness in me. Today I am a warrior. With my goal ultimately is to make a move against David. <br/>Got enough? <br/>That's what I call boiling. Ly make coconut popcorn for my friends. <br/>The thing about Zeke and I, I think we're chess players in  this game of "Survivor." I feel like I can read Zeke's mind. I feel like we're having much the same thoughts, and I hope  people see Zeke as playing harder than I am. I don't think it will be is up hard sell when it comes time to  vote him out. David and I are very similar people, but like I understand that  I’m threatening. David understands that I’m threatening. I think people see it. But I think David is more of a threat to win than I am. This is the war that everyone has been alluding to, and now it's  a scramble for who has the troops. <br/>I had a good talk with  brad this morning. He told me that David approached him this morning. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And said that I am David's next target. So...  Interesting. <br/>So David has an idol. He found it the morning after he played it. <br/>Get out of town. <br/>I think the more  dangerous couple right now is will and Jay. <br/>I just want to object to  this by saying that neither will nor Jay is coming after me right now. <br/>That's true. <br/>I want both David and Zeke  to feel like I’m in their corner, and they're both two extremely threatening  players. <br/>Look, like for the first time someone has brought your  name up. <br/>I would love to work with  David. David and I are very similar, both very neurotic people, but  it's been a month of Zeke and me working side by side, so I don't know who to  choose, either Zeke or David. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. You guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge you'll be divided into three  teams of three. Your feet will be tied together. Your arms will be bound to your sides. One at a time you will slither through the sand through a series  of obstacles. Then you'll work together to solve a puzzle. First team to finish wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for in. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Jeff: The winning three will be picked up here in this beautiful  sand pit in the middle of Fiji by chopper. You'll go up in the air and get a nice tour of this beautiful  place you've been living for the last 29 days. You'll then touch down and enjoy a "Survivor" picnic. <br/>Oh, my word. <br/>Jeff: Fried chicKen, mac and cheese. <br/>Mac and cheese? <br/>Jeff: Wine, beer, soft drinks, pie. <br/>Oh, lord. <br/>Jeff: A nice afternoon and a nice chance to strategize  away from all the losers. There's one twist of this challenge. Because only nine of you are going to run, that means one person  will not have a chance to earn their shot at reward, and they won't have to. If you draw the white rock, you don't participate, you  automatically earn a spot. Think of it as the "Survivor" lottery. <br/>Whoa. <br/>We're going to draw for teams and we'll get started. <br/>Let's do it. All right. We have our teams. It is Hannah, Jessica and Adam. It is will, dan and Jay, and it is Sunday, Zeke and Bret. David chose the white rock. This is going to be one of the most physical challenges, and all  David has to do is just wait for it to end. He's going on reward either way. Here we go. For reward, Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, Sunday, you got it. <br/>Jeff: Hand narcotic will and Sunday like inch worms. Will off to the fast start. <br/>Come on, will. <br/>Jeff: Face down. In the afraid to get dirty. Will is working it. <br/>Jeff: Come on, willie. Starting to lose those shorts. An american flag about to be left behind. Hannah like an elephant. And Sunday in last. Will very close to the relay point. Go, Ken. Now Ken has the start up and over these mounds. Here comes Hannah. <br/>Push, push, push, push, push, push. <br/>Jeff: Go, Jessica! It's now Ken in the lead, Jessica digging. This is difficult. <br/>Come on, Sunday. <br/>Jeff: Go, Zeke! <br/>Come on, Zeke, you got this. <br/>Jeff: Zeke going up and over. <br/>Ken is moving very fast, extending the lead for green. Go, Jay. It's now green with a huge lead over purple and orange. Zeke new starting to get a rhythm going. <br/>Jeff: Almost there, jess. <br/>Jeff: Jessica struggling. Jay is flying through the course. Once Jay gets to the end, all of green can release. Go, green! Start untying. You can work on the puzzle. Zeke is almost here, face down, covered in sand. Zeke looks like a "Survivor" mime. Go, Bret! Orange trying to get it in now. Jessica still trying to get up that last mound. <br/>I can't do it. <br/>Jeff: Will, Ken and Jay working on that snake puzzle. <br/>Good job, Bret. <br/>Jeff: Bret is really moving. He's going to make up a lot of time. <br/>Let's go, Bret. You're almost there. Keep digging. <br/>Jeff: That white butt glowing in the sun. Jessica really struggling. A massive setback for purple. Go, Adam. <br/>You can do it. <br/>Jeff: You can make up a lot of time in the puzzle. Bret very close to the end. Go, orange. Will, Ken and Jay struggling. Adam has now slowed down at all. Touch that mat an you are good. Go, purple. Start untying. We now have two groups working on the puzzle, and purple is now  back in it thanks to Adam. <br/>Jeff: Come on, jess. Come on. Everybody working on the puddle now. Ken, will and Jay have had a big head start working on this  puzzle for a while. Jessica, Hannah, Adam trying to catch up. <br/>We can do it, guys. <br/>There it is, there it is. <br/>Jeff: Bret, Zeke and Sunday are making a lot of progress  very quickly. <br/>I got it. <br/>It is now will, Ken and Jay that are trying to catch up. <br/>Look at the piece and look for it on the table. <br/>Suddenly all three teams are in this. That is why you never ever give up. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Three people will join David on a massive reward. <br/>Perfect. <br/>There we go. <br/>Bret with another piece. <br/>That's it. <br/>Jeff: Out of nowhere, it is Bret, Zeke and Sunday about to  close the door on this. <br/>Keep going, keep going. Jeff? <br/>Jeff: They think they have it. And they do. A massive comeback for Bret, Zeke and Sunday. Reward and a "Survivor" picnic. <br/>We get our helicopter ride. <br/>I got naked on "Survivor."  Jeff: Sunday, Bret, Zeke and David, come on over. Your ride is coming in right now. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I have an advantage in  this game that allows me to steal a reward from another player. And I was very tempted to use it, especially because David  didn't earn this one, but I felt like it was the best decision for me to hang  on to my advantage and save it for another day. <br/>Jeff: All right. Adam, Jessica, Hannah, Ken, Jay, will, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. <br/>Look at this. Can you believe the water? <br/>My dream was not only the get on "Survivor" but  to win a helicopter reward, so this ranks up there as one of my favorite days  literally ever in my life. I feel like I’m ten years old. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Cheer, guys. Zeke, here we go again, brother. I got a nice buzz on. <br/>My new drinking buddy is Bret. I don't really like to drink beer, but I want to cultivate a  relationship with Bret. If he wants me to be his new drinking buddy, I’m his new  drinking buddy. <br/>I need to take a walk. <br/>And then there were two, two drunks. <br/>Sitting on a beach. <br/>My drinking buddy. <br/>My drinking buddy. <br/>It's nice breaking bread with you. <br/>We're going to be part of each other's lives whether we  like it or not. <br/>I've been watching "Survivor." it's just part of  my life. As you get older, you start to learn who you really and you  start to not care what people think. <br/>What's up? <br/>I’m trying to get closer  to Zeke. I want to work with Zeke. I just like him as a person. <br/>My family has a place down the cape. <br/>We'll do like july or august. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Right on. <br/>Yeah. I will tell you, you're not the only gay guy out here. <br/>You? <br/> I’m playing a game here. <br/>I was going to tell  everyone, and then I had macchio group, I had again, Chris, I was like, I got  to just shut my mouth here. It just didn't happen. <br/>Right on. <br/>I’m a different generation. <br/>No, I understand. <br/>You know, we don't talk about it. <br/>It's different for everybody. <br/>I didn't grow up at a  time when it was normal to talk about being gay, and Zeke finds comfort in  being himself. I think that's great. I'm hoping that as my life goes on from here on out, I can be  that way. <br/>I have never had a  problem. Like you tell your friends, nobody cares, it's just in my head. It's been in my head my whole life, you know? But, you know, you become 40, and you're like, I don't care what  anyone thinks anymore. You know what I mean? I am who I am. I have great friends. I do whatever I do. You know what I mean? <br/>Yeah. I never thought about not saying anything. <br/>I lived with not saying  anything. So for me to come out here and not say anything, it's... I've  lived like that. <br/>But you have to play "Survivor" the way you live  your life, you know, you can't try to do something new on "Survivor."  I owe a lot to Bret's generation. I would not be able to come out at 15 were there not the pioneers  who paved the way. And I think he really reflects the millennial-gen x divide. He spent time in the military during the don't ask don't tell  era, where he couldn't have been in the military if he told people he was  gay. I'm excited that Bret is getting chance to reap the reward of  what he has sown. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Cheers, brother. <br/>So Zeke and I were starting to talk, but we wanted to wait  until you got back. <br/>Thank you. <br/>So what's your thoughts on David? <br/>Yeah. I'm nervous. <br/>I’m nervous, too. <br/>You? <br/>I’m nervous. I'm glad he's here so I can... I know what he's up to, you know? I think if we can get dave and will on board, I can bring in Hannah. We can pull off the blind side. We have to make sure David doesn't sense we're coming for him. <br/>Right. <br/>Bret and I, we have the rainbow connection. And Bret, Sunday and I, we're all alike. David is the biggest threat in this game. And I am delighted to hear. This because now I think I have united them against an enemy and  they are my loyal soldiers. <br/>Hey, kids. <br/>Hell he. <br/>Hey, Hannah. <br/>How was it? <br/>It was all right. <br/>Shut up, Bret, you loser. <br/>So the winners get back. Zeke, Bret, Sunday and David, and I immediately grab David. <br/>Want that get wood or something. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I’m playing between David  and Zeke, but I’m going with my gut, and my decision is to go after Zeke  because Zeke is cobd sending and he can be a flip-flopper. So Bret tells Zeke you're gunning for him, Zeke turns to Adam  and tell him you have an idol. But don't freak out. Don't freak out. Here's the good part. <br/>There's in good part. <br/>This is the good part, ready? <br/>What? <br/>The good part is Zeke trusts me. <br/>No, but I appreciate that, but...  No, no, no, no. So if he's going to make a move against you, I’m going to know. <br/>Here's the deal, Hannah, my idol is for me and it's for  you, okay? <br/>Okay. <br/>Bret is walking toward the water. <br/>So here's the thing...  You're making me so nervous. <br/>Zeke is now telling people that I have an idol at the  very...  Oh, my God. <br/>You look beautiful, like a peruvian ozzie. <br/>Hannah, I blew up my game clearly. <br/>No, you didn't. <br/>No, you didn't. <br/>Hannah tells me that Bret told Zeke that I’m gunning for  him, which is like, oh, complete miscalculation on my part. <br/>I’m sorry. No, no, no, I knew you'd be upset. You're not going home. Hey, hey, don't get neurotic on me. <br/>I’m not. The. Because you're going to waste your idol. <br/>Can I pitch something, we go after Zeke now, let the vote  be me, I play my idol, Zeke goes home. <br/>I want to see where Zeke's  head is at. If Zeke finds out I’m working with you, I'm... If Zeke finds out  I’m working with you, I'm...  Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. Shall we get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>First things first, David...  I hate to give it up. <br/>Jeff: I know you do. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge you're going to stand behind a cage door,  and you'll maneuver handle through a maze. Once your handle is free, you'll unlock the door and race to  complete a slide puzzle. First person to finish wins immunity, guaranteed a one in nine  shot at winning this game. Losers, tribal council, somebody will become the fourth member  of our jury. Draw for spots. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! First you've got to untie your handle. Then you start working it through the maze. You are blind. You cannot see where the maze is leading. You have to do all of this by touch. This is going to be about trying pathways that work and then  running into a dead end and trying to remember, I don't want to go back  there. Where was that? How do I get get out of here? It's so easy for me, I can just follow the color. I know if you're doing well or not. Ly not be saying who is in the lead and who is falling behind. You will not know where you are in the maze until you're out of  it. Everybody trying to figure this out. Is there a pattern. Am I at the same dead end. You can use your hands to feel ahead or you can just go for it. But if somebody comes through this quickly, you will have a  giant start on that slide puzzle. Jay has his free. Jay is through his door. Jay can start working on the slide puzzle. Now we got it going on. Now you are trying to catch Jay. Jay quickly gets to work on that puzzle, sliding pieces around. It look so close. And you can be one piece off and it's a setback. This could be over quickly if Jay is good at slides puddles. Panic really setting in. Am I close? Do I have a shot? Jay thinks he has it. That looks like the "Survivor" logo to me. Jay wins individual immunity, not even close. Nobody even out of the maze. <br/>Nice work, Jay. <br/>Good work, Jay. <br/>Jeff: That is an official "Survivor" blowout. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: Jay, come on over. <br/>Good job, Jay. <br/>Jeff: It was pretty to watch. <br/>That was great. <br/>Jeff: Individual immunity, Jay safe tonight at tribal  council. You will not be going home. As for the rest of you, 30 days is a long time the play this  game, but for one of you, that's as far as it goes, somebody voted out will  become the fourth member of our jury. It won't be you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>Thank you, guys. We had an immunity challenge today. Guess who came out champion? I did. I won. I crushed these fools. So who are you going to give it to? Take your pick. Surprise. I still have an idol, but I’m not saving it. I saved it so long for myself, I’m going to keep it for myself. <br/>Just you and I? <br/>It feels that way. <br/>I have a favor to ask  you. Basically all I did, I was trying the lure Bret and Sunday over  to our side, and I told Bret that you know who the biggest threat in this  game, is and you mow who it is, right? <br/>Zeke. <br/>Exactly. That's not a good thing. I need to write down scek's name tonight, you, me and Ken? <br/>Why. <br/>Because he's gunning for me tonight. <br/>Oh, lord. <br/>I have to protect David  and vote for Zeke, because David actually played a hidden immunity idol for  me, but if David had just let well enough alone and not said anything, this wouldn't  be happening. <br/>He's going to vote dave? <br/>I’m going to stay with David. I made a promise to the man I would never put his name down, so  I want to go out swinging and fighting with David in this game. <br/>I want to work with you. David is a guaranteed winner. He has an idol. So would you say that overall, ranking threat, that David is the  most threatening person in the game? <br/> Would you agree with that assessment? <br/>It's said a little harshly, but just...  Just concern is that fair? <br/>I’m trying to make a  larger point. <br/>I know, I’m thinking. <br/>I have attempted to  cultivate Hannah as a very, very close ally, and as we're talking, it becomes  very clear to me that Hannah does not have my best interests at heart. <br/>You don't talk to David and tell him I’m coming for him. <br/>You both know you're coming for each other. <br/>But you don't talk to him about that, do you? <br/>David, you both know it. <br/>Right. This is a question of whether or not you're going to play the  rest of this game with David or with me. <br/>Okay. <br/>I realize that I’m no  longer going to be working with Hannah. It was going to be David, but David has an idol, and if David  plays the idol, we're screwed, so if Hannah wants to become one of David's  numbers, she becomes my enemy and I have her no problem voting her out of the  game. Hannah is in David's pocket. I don't trust Hannah. <br/>Neither do it. <br/>Hannah is in David's pocket. I'm going to vote Hannah. Okay. <br/>Got it. <br/>I think we're good. <br/>Jay, I’m writing Hannah. H after h Hannah. <br/>It's going to be David's army or my army. So I’m trusting Bret and Sunday and Jay. So we have five votes together, which is half. Which means at worst we tie. Wan  Right. <br/>David wants Zeke out. You and I need to stick together and choose a side. I trust you. You and I genuinely want to sit next to each other at the end. <br/>What do you want me to do? Who do we vote for? <br/>Zeke. <br/>Hannah wants to vote for seek tonight, but I’m not  confident about the plan tonight because I have been sitting back a little  bit. And allowing Hannah to run the show a little bit. And Hannah is a nervous girl. And it makes me nervous. <br/>Adam wants to work with me. I'm with you 120%. <br/>Who do we have then, just...  Me, you, Adam, Jay, Ken all vote for Zeke, which gives us five,  but if they put five and five, I’m the one they're going to target. <br/>You don't know that, just a gut feeling. You're nervous, you're getting neurotic. <br/>No, Zeke, he doesn't trust me. I know it's me. I'm probably going to need your idol tonight. <br/>Right. <br/>My ocd is going crazy right now. It's like the anxiety is too much. My body can't control it. I feel like David should play his idol for me because if the  vote changes at all, it's going to be against me. <br/>It's f it's a 5-5 tie, let's say I did play the idol and  it's not you, then there's a revote, it will probably come back to the tie  again, and then rocks get drawn. <br/>Tonight is huge. If we really do have five votes and there's no really anymore,  who the hell knows what's happening, but if we really do have five votes  against Zeke, then it would be a tie, and then we'll have to revote and it  will require somebody flipping. Question is: Who would flip? My people, their people? I'm not even sure that it will be 5-5. So I’m really schizophrenic about what I’m going to do with my  idol. I hope I play the idol for the right person. This is really the scariest part of the game for me thus far. This is really the scariest part of the game for me thus far. <br/>I'll bring in the members of our jury. <br/>Michelle, Taylor and Chris voted out at the last tribal  council. <br/>All right. So let's get into this. At the last tribal council, I asked, how many people are pretty  certain you know where the vote is going. Quite a few of you said 100%. How many people tonight feel the same way? Nobody? Wow. Okay. How many of you feel some sense of security that it won't be you  tonight? [laughter] you're the only one. David, is it going to be just another crazy vote, or is this a  turning point in the game? <br/>You know, I don't know. Here's the deal: I feel like one of those fruit bats back at  camp, like the world looks upside down. This is the most chaotic tribal I think we've seen yet, or at  least it's about to be. <br/>Jeff: Really? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Jay that to me says the game play is so good you  guys are playing as if this is your second time but it's not. <br/>Honestly, everyone here is playing full on pedal to the  metal let's do this because everyone is such a sooner fan of this game. All this whispering, I don't know what is even being said. <br/>Jeff: David, you're sitting almost smack dab in the  middle. <br/>Yeah. This is what's known as a trust cluster muck. <br/>There's no cluster. Knock that crap off, all right? <br/>Jeff: Bret, why did that get you so upset? <br/>Because this... Enough with this. Give me a break. This is every man for himself right now. This is insane. You talk. You hope what's being told you is correct and you move forward,  you know? <br/>Jeff: Well, would members of Zeke's alliance like to raise  their hand? <br/>Oh, David? <br/>Would members of David's alliance like to raise their  hand. <br/>Oh, I’m going to cry. <br/>That's a personal attack. I didn't personally attack anybody. <br/>Personal attack. <br/>All right, all right. <br/>That's where we're at right now. <br/>Jeff: I don't even know what to say. Adam, what are you thinking right now? Are you nervous? <br/>Hell, yes, I’m nervous, Jeff. I am now less sure of what was going on than I was when I walked  into tribal council tonight. The vote is still very much live. <br/>Jessica, you look like, huh, how can it be live? What's going on? <br/>I am so it -- utterly  confused. I have no idea what's happening. <br/>Drew: Ken, how do we know when it's time the say, pencils  down, let's vote? <br/>We have the guillotine ready. The knife is about to drop. We're still trying to figure out, whose head have we thrown  under. I've never seen anything like this. There are so many conversations happening right here. I'm curious why we're so easily mixed up by someone simply  whispering. That's insane. <br/>Ken, this is the game, welcome to it. <br/>Whoa. <br/>I’m very well aware of  that, Bret. What are we doing right now? That's what I’m asking? <br/>This is all smoke and mirrors. That's all nonsense. <br/>Jeff: Smoke and mirrors. So Zeke, is tonight's vote about what is true and what is one  big facade? <br/>Yeah. Everyone wonders who they can trust, who they think they're  voting with. I don't think anyone feels sure that those they have had  conversations with are going to do what they said they were going to do. <br/>Jeff: Wow. <br/>You know, tribal council is theater, Jeff, and I think  we've proven that tonight. <br/>I say we vote. <br/>Should we vote? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time the vote. Will, you're up. Will, you're up. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Get the hell off me. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. <br/>Sorry, Jeff. <br/>What? <br/>Wait. Here you go, Jeff. <br/>Hold on. They were whispering over here. They want to vote for Ken. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff, the idol is for Ken. <br/>Whoa. <br/>All right. Any votes cast for Ken will not count. <br/>Damn. <br/>I'll read the votes. First vote, Zeke. <br/>Hannah. <br/>Dammit. I knew it. Told you. Zeke. Hannah. Two votes Zeke, two votes Hannah. Zeke. We're tied again. Three votes Zeke, three votes Hannah. Zeke. We're tied again. Four votes Zeke, four votes Hannah. Zeke. That's five votes Zeke, four votes Hannah, one vote left. Hannah. We're tied. Here's what's going to happen. We're going to have a revote. Hannah and Zeke, you will not vote. Everybody else you can only vote for Hannah or Zeke. Will, will you come grab the urn. <br/>I'd love to, Jeff. <br/>I have realigned with  you. <br/>Jessica? Trust me. Please don't vote for me. <br/>Jessica. <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. I'll read the votes. <br/>Hannah. Zeke. Hannah. Zeke. Two votes Hannah, two votes Zeke. Hannah. Zeke. Tied again. Three votes Hannah, three votes Zeke. Hannah. That's four votes Hannah, three votes Zeke, one vote left. Zeke. <br/>Oh, my God. We're deadlocked. Here's what will happen. Per the rules of "Survivor," if the eight of you can  unanimously agree on either Hannah or Zeke, they go home. If you cannot, unanimously agree, then Hannah and Zeke become  immune and they join Jay and Ken and all four become safe and will, Bret, Sunday,  Adam, David, and Jessica will all draw rocks. The odd rock goes home. This is a do-or-die moment right now. <br/>Guys, can the eight of us agree that none of us are  willing to give up our games for either one of these two? <br/>I don't want to go home. <br/>I don't think anybody  wants to go home tonight. So let the eight of us come to a decision on one or the other  because I’m not going home. <br/>If I can pitch something, I do believe Zeke is playing the  best game of the people, but if you believe I am, fine, vote me out next, but  tonight it has to be Zeke. <br/>David is never going to let me stay in this game. <br/>Who wants to vote Hannah? <br/>Right here. <br/>You wanted...  I was trying to get you  out. <br/>Who did you vote for? <br/>You said you would vote for Chris. <br/>I never said that and I didn't  vote for Chris. <br/>I don't want to draw  rocks. I do not want the draw rocks. <br/>Well, it's going to go there. <br/>So what I’m hearing right now is complete disarray. We don't have unanimous decision. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: Here's what has now happened. Because you guys can't control your own fate by coming to an  agreement, Hannah, who is in trouble is safe, Zeke who is in trouble, is  safe. Jay has immunity, he's safe. Ken has immunity idol thanks to David, he's safe. So six people will draw rocks, will, Bret, Sunday, Adam, David,  and Jessica. One of you is about to go home after 30 days in Survivor by  making the biggest move you can in this game, going to rocks. There are five white rocks. There is one black rock. White means you're safe, black means you're going home. All right. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Grab it and don't look. <br/>Jeff, I think I’m going to cry. All right. Million dollar rock draw. Black means you are out of this game. Reveal. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh. Jessica. <br/>Sorry, jess. <br/>Sorry, Jessica. I didn't want it to go to rocks. David did. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>You played a great game Jessica. <br/>Great, Jessica. . <br/>Jeff: Jessica, I think it's more appropriate tonight to  say, the game has spoKen. <br/>It's time for you to go. <br/>We drew rocks. And now I’m out of the game. I found the legacy advantage, but since I’m not in the game  anymore, I have to will this to somebody, so I am leaving this legacy  advantage to Ken, and I hope that he is here on day 36 so he can take  advantage of whatever is contained within this envelope. <br/>Jeff: Drawing rocks is the ultimate "Survivor"  all-in move. With this many people making an all-in move, it says the rest of  this game is going to be insane. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor," David gets a  glimmer of hope. <br/>I’m ready to start  playing this game hard. <br/>I’m an endangered  species. That was music to my ears. <br/>And the loved ones visit. <br/>I think it is a perfect  time for love. Flips the game. <br/>I actually have an  advantage in this game. <br/>This truly has been the most incredible experience that I could  have ever hoped for. I'm incredibly proud of myself that I made it as far as I have,  but I just switch my vote to hanna I wouldn't be sitting here right now, Hannah  would be. Oh, my God.
