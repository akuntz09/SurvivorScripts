<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously onSurvivor... Jaburu was divided by differences in work ethic. Can we keep it clean, please? Shawna: They're just constantly trying to make everyone feel bad, like they're not doing enough. Probst: And Heidi, Shawna and Jenna formed an alliance to protect themselves. If we could swing Deena's vote, then it was, you know, game on. Heidi: I just need to know. -Yes. -[shouting] Probst: The men won their first reward. Ah, yeah, boys! Tambaqui! Probst: Jaburu's loss sent them -into a downward spiral. -Well, that sucked. Probst: And Shawna asked her tribe to vote her out. I don't see myself lasting for 30 more days. Probst: Tambaqui's fishing skills won them immunity. Tambaqui, congratulations. And Jaburu was forced to choose between protecting their alliance or Shawna's health. If Shawna wants to go first, are we putting her first -before Joanna? -No. Deena: It's about the core alliance. And suck it up, baby, 'cause you're along as long as we want you to. Probst: Although Shawna chose not to vote with the alliance, they still forced her to stay in the game by voting Joanna out of the tribe. The tribe has spoken. 12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Deena: With Joanna gone, I feel as if I am in control. I am... alpha female top dog right at this point in time. But Jeanne is unbelievably pissed off. I can't even begin to tell you how pissed off Jeanne is. Jeanne: I was really in shock when Joanna got voted off last night. Shawna's such a liability. She needed to go. She was crying. She was almost begging to go, and they vote the strongest person off. Smart. Shawna: It's truly ironic that the people I set up my alliance with are now trapping me inside the game totally against my will. I'm just... I'm at the lowest of my low, and no one is respecting the fact that I am falling apart. Deena: Shawna's problem is 70% mental. We're not going to sacrifice ourselves for her sake, so she might as well buck up and play with the rest of us. Alex: I think we're definitely getting the hang of living out here. Like, I was thinking about it today. We just tromp around out here like it's our backyard. How you doing over there, Butch? I went through mine. I'm almost through this thing. Ow! -All right? -Damn it. Come on. Banged myself in the forehead. Yeah, you got a cut. Keep going. Clear right through. What happened to you? Banged myself in the head. With the machete? -Are you bleeding? -Yeah. Go get a cold Coke. I got it! I got it! I don't want to bandage it till I get the swell... -make sure the swelling goes down. -Yeah. -Thanks. -I really want to get some iodine on there, you know? This will... Okay. Matthew: I'm actually surprised that an injury like this has not happened earlier. No one here is really that experienced with, uh, working with a machete. So he's lucky, since it's not very serious. I'm going to pull your skin. Do you feel like -it's going together a little bit? -Yeah, it's fine. Fine. Not only does it look functional, Alex, but it looks cool. -Yeah. -It really does look cool. -Yep. -Yeah. Alex: Chicks dig scars, so, you know, maybe, uh... maybe that'll work out for the best. Jeanne: I just wanted to address every... everybody this morning, because of a conversation I overheard last night. You guys were talking pretty loud, and I didn't sleep at all. I wasn't feeling too hot. I heard Deena say your problem was that you weren't part of the team. If you think that I wasn't part of the team... I was talking about her. It didn't sound like that. Deena: No, I was talking about Christy's attitude in the first three days. -Is something else bothering you? -Jeanne: No. No. -This is a big deal. -I don't see why you would even think you... we wouldn't think you were part... You do so much. -I mean, you know you do a lot. -It's an atmosphere of paranoia. I didn't know what your plan was yesterday. -No one, you know... -Deena: There was some personality differences, and we all want to feel like -we're unified. -Well, I feel like you guys are unified, 'cause you guys hang here and I... I'm always out there. So I'm gonna stay here today, near the fire, and let you guys go out there. I... and... have at it. -Okay. -Because I'm sick and tired of the damn thing. Okay. -Have it. -Cool. Deena: Jeanne is sweating in her panties. She's thinking, "God help me, what am I going to do?" Cool. I have a feeling this is, like, Pandora's Box. -Ooh... -Ooh... Vino! -Okay, cats. -Hey, hey, sports fans. Rob: "Prepare to have "a little fun, "unfortunately, for only one. "The map will show you the place you're after. Send your youngest for wine and laughter." Dave: Hey, hey, we got a map. -So, who's going? -Who's our youngest? -Who's our youngest? -Who's our youngest? -Dave! -Yeah! I wish I had voted Dave out of here on day one. Rob: I was very upset, because... I wanted to go for wine and laughter. I'm just very annoyed that the golden boy Dave falls face-first into good luck. -Prepare to have a little fun. -Dave: Well, I better go get showered and, uh, lathered up, baby. Jeanne: "...only one. "The map will show the place you're after. "Send your youngest for wine and laughter." No way! Is that just Jenna's going? Deena: Get ready, baby. Jenna: And it said only one person can go and send your youngest, and immediately I was, like, oh, I'm the youngest, so I'm gonna have to do something by myself. Don't assume youngest means age. What do you think, we age differently, like cheese? -Could be youngest at heart. -Jenna: And I was, like, youngest means youngest-- come on, now. I'm the youngest; give it a break. I'm going somewhere, and you're not. -Good luck. -Have fun. -Thank you. Bye, guys. -Bye. -Take care. -Rock on, Jenna! Come on in, guys. Paddle in as close as you can get. Dave: After quite a long paddle, ended up at this fantastic bungalow with Jenna. We paddled up together, a little apprehensive, uh, curious. -Welcome, guys. -Dave: Hello. -You know each other, right? -Right. 13 days, you've been out here in the Amazon jungle. -That's right. -Separated from day one into tribes of men and women with no tribal interaction outside of challenges. You know, in the Amazon the local Indians have a saying: History belongs to the old men, the village belongs to the adults, but opportunity is for the young. So we thought, maybe it's about time we had an official "get to know you." -Yeah. -Based on age-- you are both the youngest-- you were selected. You may view this as a break from the tribes; you may view it as a strategic opportunity. That is up to you guys. You will have plenty of food... -Oh! -Oh! -[both laughing] ...couple of bottles of wine, outdoor shower with fresh water. We've got towels, slippers, robes, and of course, a beautiful and very, very soft bed... -We're staying here? -...with clean sheets. -For the night? -You're staying here tonight. -Oh, yes! -Very nice! -Your casa... -awaits. -Thank you very much. -Yay! -Thank you. -Have a good time, guys. Will do. All right! -Oh, my God! -[laughs] Jenna: It was, like, our own little, like, private bungalow for two in the middle of, like, this gorgeous jungle, and I was, like, "You've got to be crapping me," because... it's, like, sensory overload. Oh, shoes off. Dave: First thing we did was get out of the stinky, sweaty clothes, put on the bath robes, and, uh, we both sat down and started eating grapes and drinking wine and eating cheese and cra... It was... it was heaven. It was... it was heaven in the Amazon. -Cheers. -Cheers. Okay. So, yeah, so Jaburu life's -going well? -Um, it's good. -Mm-hmm. -It's good. Though I know our tribe is pretty boring. See, we don't do a lot of talking, and I try to tell the girls, I'm, like, you know what, we should do, like, talk, like, every day just to be real. Jenna: We were so excited to actually talk to someone of the opposite sex, we were, like, ready to just, like, chat away. Heidi, who I've become really close to... -I expected that. -She's, like, really, really upbeat all the time. And Shawna is falling apart. She doesn't wanna be here; we just keep her on the tribe. Jenna did go into great detail about the status of her tribe. However, you got to think, do you want to be revealing all this about... about your tribe? So I approached Heidi, I was, like, we need to stick together, the younger people, and we approached Shawna, said we need to stick together. Shawna approached Deena. There's us, our four, against three. Who would you have voted next? Uh, probably Jeanne. Her attitude has really gotten bad since Joanna's left. I'm telling you all this stuff, but, oh, well. Dave: I'll give you a rundown of our tribe. Roger, he's a kind of engineer. He's 56. Alex is 33. -Wow. -He is a triathlon coach out of Los Angeles... [fading]: and, uh... We, uh... we have a good time. All of us, like, all the guys are really nice. But it's crude. Rob talks about Heidi's breasts. We talk about your-your ass. Mine?! -Barely even there. -You have a sexy ass. [laughs]: Oh, God! You have a sexy ass, so we talk about your sexy ass. Oh... ah... Went and took a shower, I had four walls. The walls were made out of palm fronds. They were semi-translucent. But the water's clean. You know, it felt really good just to have something... something fall on my head. You didn't wear shoes, did you? -No, I didn't. -Jenna took a shower after I took a shower. See, you're gonna be able to see my, like, boobs. [laughs] Dave: So, there's a naked girl in the shower that you can see into, and I'm standing on the other side of camp brushing my teeth, thinking that this is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. -Jenna: Very cool. -Are you a snorer? I don't know. Do you snore? Dave: I twitch for, like... -right before I fall asleep. -[laughing] Jenna: We got to sleep in a bed, which was so refreshing. It couldn't have been a better reward challenge, because we didn't have to do anything except just be born in the right year. Jenna: Oh... this is so funny. -Dave: This is classic. -[laughs] [birds chirping, insects chittering] -[Dave groans] -Jenna: Good morning. Dave: Morning. That was nice. Dave: I slept so well, and Jenna was fantastic to sleep next to. She didn't kick; she didn't bite; she didn't... snore. Dave: Oh, my God. Jenna, you are gonna die when you see this food out here right now. There's more? We're eating it in bed. Oh, wow! Jenna: There was, like, fruit juice there, crescent rolls, breads, Danish-type bread, fruit, bananas. It was so great. This is just bitchin'. I'm gonna fall asleep. Jenna: Uh-oh. Good morning. -Morning. -Look at this scene. Oh, my. -We had fun. We really... -Yeah? -Uh-huh. And we didn't... we didn't hold back anything. We told it all. We pretty much know everything about each other's -tribes now. -Good. Plant it down here. Grab a pillow. Boom, here and here. Just a little more business to take care of, that's all. -We'll be out of here. -Oh... Jenna: And then he said, okay, take a seat at the table, and I was, like, aw, man, take a seat at the table-- I was, like, that means this isn't even over yet. Well, I am glad to hear that you guys shared a little bit of information. That information's gonna come in real handy, 'cause the game's about to take a turn. We're gonna have a little draft, and you two are in charge of picking new tribes. So, here's how it's gonna work. You two will alternate in your choices and you'll begin with a member of the opposite sex, and then you'll go man, woman, man, woman. So it really doesn't matter who goes first. Anybody want to? You go first. Dave, make your first choice: it's a woman. Dave: I think she regretted saying a lot of the information she did. Jenna had talked a lot about her alliance with Heidi and how strong Heidi was. You know... -Oh, God, don't screw me... -I... I've only heard good things about Heidi, -and, uh... -Oh, God, no. -So... -Probst: Heidi. First member of Tambaqui. -Sorry. -Killing me, you're killing me. Aw, man, I hurt hard when he took her because she was, like, my rock here, and I don't know what I'm gonna do without her. Like, when she... she... Ooh, it almost made me want to cry. Jenna, who's the first guy? Um, I'm gonna have to pull Alex, because of his athletic ability and stamina. Probst: Alex now a member of Jaburu. All right, Dave, now you're picking a guy. -Butch. -So you're gonna keep Butch -on Tambaqui. -I'm keeping Butch. Jenna. Deena. Deena by far. -Probst: Deena stays on Jaburu. -Yeah. Dave. Picking a woman. I'm gonna take Christy. Probst: Christy now a member of Tambaqui. Pick another guy, Jenna. I'm gonna have to go for Rob. Probst: Rob now a member of Jaburu. -Dave, pick a guy. -Um... I'm gonna take Roger. Probst: Roger stays on Tambaqui. I'm gonna take Shawna. Probst: Shawna stays with Jaburu. Last two choices are already made. -You got Jeanne... -JENNA [whispers]: Matthew. and Matthew becomes a member of Jaburu. So, those are our new tribes. Jenna: So, that was it, new tribes, as easy as that, in ten minutes. [laughs] It's just like the game started again. -It's like a brand-new game. -Probst: Jenna, three new buffs. Dave: Jeff gave us three new buffs and a map... -Let's go. -...and said we had to paddle back and... tell everybody, and away they go. [insects buzzing] -Waiting on Dave. -Dave... -Where are you, Dave? -Dave's at some Amazon bed and breakfast eating melba toast and, uh, Belgian waffles. Roger: Here he is. I see him. -Big Dave! -Hey! -Boo-yah! -Sounds good. -What have you got for us, kid? He brought the map back. All right. Woke up early this morning, I had... had some food, thought of you guys, raised a toast and all that stuff. Jeff came in, and he dumps out all these chips on the table with names of all the tribe members. So we have new tribes. Um... with that being said, I picked... Butch and Roger staying here with me, and... Alex, Rob and Matt are going to Jenna's tribe. Rob: So he's, like, "Well, "let me tell you guys this: "I completely was true to us, "and I completely took advantage of Jenna. "Oh, by the way, Rob, Alex and Matt, "you're gonna go live with... you're gonna go to Jenna's camp "with Shawna and Deena, and a bunch of other girls are gonna stay here with me, Butch and Roger." I chose, strategy-wise, on how I thought the six of us were... would be strongest to go into the merge. -Rob: We taking our stuff? -You're taking your stuff and your luxury item. -Okay, guys. Here. -The chicks coming... -The chicks coming here? -Roger, take care. See you soon. Dave: And, uh, we'll tag up with you guys tomorrow at the immunity challenge. -We're good. -Whup your ass. Rob: I was very mad when I found out that my fate in this game would be determined by Dave. I don't think he has my best interests at heart. Tambaqui at heart, fellas. He cares about himself, and, apparently, about Roger and about Butch. I-I really hope it works out. It was kind of the, uh, thought -behind the whole thing. -Let me take a look at the map. -Good luck. I mean that. -See you guys on the flip side, guys. -All right. -Hey, give me a hug. -All right, buddy. -See you later, buddy, all right? -All right, you guys. -Peace. -Yay...! -Oh, my God! Jeanne: Cinderella's back from the ball! How was it? It was fun, until a certain point, and then it didn't get fun. -Jeanne: It was fun till what? -Three of you guys are going to Tambaqui, and it's Heidi, Jeanne and Christy. Heidi: Jenna and I are pretty buddy-buddy, so when she came up and told the three of us... -It was, uh, we picked... -Oh, can I get a hug? -they picked, we... -Can we get a group hug before we do this? I really couldn't... it was a shock to me. So, I mean, it was kind of, like, "Oh, man, that really stinks!" -I love you. -I love you, too. I'm sorry. I tried to keep us all together. [sniffles] I tried. -Cool. -Bye, guys. -Bye. -Bye, ladies. Christy: Jeanne, I think your clothes are over here. Jeanne: Ha, ha, ha... I'm psyched, actually. Obviously, I was feeling fine. I was happy that I was leaving that group. -Bye! -Jenna: Here's your map. Jenna: Love you guys. Heidi: All three of us are in the same situation right now. What are they gonna think? What are we gonna do? Yeah, but if we ever had to create an alliance, it's now. Christy: Thank you, Jeanne, for paddling over there. -I'm so glad. -That's okay. I just wanted to tell you... -Dave: Hey, hey, hey, hey! -Heidi: Hey! -Welcome to Tambaqui. -Whoo-hoo! -Uh-oh. -Here they are. -Comb my hair. -Put my shirt on. -We're up here. Why don't, uh... -Heidi: Okay, great. ...you come do the tour. -Hi, guys. -We mixed it all up. -Wow! -How are you? -Butch. -Jeanne. -Jeanne, I'm pleased to meet you. -Roger. -Roger, Jeanne. -Hi. Christy. -Christy, good to meet you. Good to meet you, Chr-Christy. -Christy. -So nice to meet you. -Hi, Heidi. -Pleasure. -Hi. -Sorry we stink; we were fishing. Jeanne: I was impressed. Dave, Roger and Butch all welcomed us. I mean, it was like a celebration of a new tribe. -I felt awesome. -Cool! Just to let you guys know, since we're in a circle, I am deaf, so, um, you just got to look at me when you talk to me. When I say "What?" please say it again. I'm... at nighttime, I'm very... not helpful. If um... don't know how you guys watch fire, if, like, one person will stay up all night and watch fire. -No, we don't watch fire. -We don't watch fire. Roger: Very surprised to find out that Christy is deaf, and also very surprised in how well she is doing. I never would have guessed that she was deaf by watching the other tribe. -It's... it's amazing. -So, where you guys from? Dave: Well, I think without further ado, though... -Yeah! -All right! Jeanne: Is this our initiation? -Yup. -Cool. Thanks. Dave: If you got any speeches or whatnot. Jeanne: So, I'm psyched. Raise up. You're the new guys... or the new girls. ALL: Cheers! -Tambaqui! -Tambaqui! -Tambaqui! Jeanne: I'm psyched. I'm psyched. [insects chittering] -Alex: Honey, we're home! -Rob: Ladies, we're here! -Deena: They're coming. -[Shawna groans] Oh, yeah! What's up? -Whoo! -What's up, boys? -[laughs] -Yay! Yeah! Deena: It's amazing what a little bit of testosterone can do for somebody. Boys come into the camp, and Shawna is... 180 degrees better. -Hi. [laughing] -How are you? -How are you guys? -We all stink really bad. -Hey. -Oh, it's okay. How are you? -Good. -Hey! -Hi! -Hi! Great to be part of the family. Look at this new buff. It's a privilege to be here. Rob: You were smiling all the time, just like I was. So I knew you were as excited as I was to be here. Jenna: See, that's what we were lacking here, some laughter. -Well, that's... -Oh, well, you got the right guys, then. Rob: I'm going to wait before I attempt any sort of proposition to these girls, but... should Shawna and Jenna walk around here naked, I will promise them I will not cast a vote in their direction until the merger. Christy: That really shows that, yeah, man, I'm actually in a team where... we're thinking on the same level-- like, I think -we'll kick some butt. -The one thing I like about this tribe is they're very aware that, okay, we got somebody who's deaf and they really try to make sure I'm looking. Roger: Can you... can you see? Christy: I see Roger. I see Butch. -Roger: Is that okay? -I think, yeah. Butch: You have to look at Christy, because she's deaf. I'm making an extra effort to make sure she knows what's going on. I'm making sure that she, you know, sees me. At night we can make the lantern a little brighter. That way, she can read our lips and be included in the evening conversation and make her feel even more welcome. Guys, I mean, I'm just really glad to be in a group where this lantern is useful, you know? In that Jaburu tribe, it was not even... it was never possible. So I really, you know... and me feeling comfortable, I will definitely do... put my 110% into this tribe. It's just a really, uh... good feeling inside. So knowing that I was in a really good group, I really appreciate that. Alex: See if you guys can guess who got the most votes for the hottest girl on... on the old Jaburu tribe. Jenna. -My guess was Shawna. -Rob: You are correct. -That is correct. -Shawna: Huh! -Shawna, you... -Shawna, Shawna took the... Shawna took it down. Shawna: Alex is so fun. I dig him so much. He is adorable. I dig his sense of humor. He's my type, you know? Matthew: Yeah, I-I really like the way the team came together. I mean, based on what we know about who we left behind. Alex: Yeah. Deena: I'm hurtin'. Deena went from top to the bottom. Shawna may not be so interested in the chick thing anymore. Shawna may be interested in the Alex thing. How loyal will she be to Jenna and myself? Because clearly it should be the three women against the three men, if we are going -to protect one another. -23. -Where are you from? -California. San Francisco. -Where? Nice! I used to live in San Francisco. -Where? Where are you from? -I'm... I actually went to high school in Alameda. -Are you serious? -I am serious. Jeanne: Hey, guys! We got treemail! -Butch: Treemail? Whoo! All right! -Yeah! Our first challenge together, and the fearless crew is ready. What does it say? -"Paddle..." -"Paddle," "practice," "immunity," "brawn" and "animals." Dave: You see the "brawn" and the "paddle," and you're like, all right, -you know we're going rowing. -Right, right. Roger: I think our chances of winning are-are very good. These-These three girls are strong. I'm very pleased with Dave's selection. We got three, uh, good women over here. Yeah, we feel very confident. Probst: First things first. Immunity back up for grabs. So, this is myfirst chance to get a look at the new tribes. Heidi, what was the reaction when you saw and figured out -what was going down? -Some of us weren't sure. I think it was needed, and it -was a different pace. -What was your take, Alex? Rob and Matthew and I are totally psyched. Couldn't be happier. We got an awesome team over here and we're, uh, we're stoked. Probst: Okay, your first challenge as new tribes is for immunity, and it works in two stages. First stage is a word scramble. You'll have ten images on your puzzle board associated with the Amazon. Only five of those will show up in the word scramble. Once you find all five words, you move to the second stage, where you will paddle out and around the island, retrieving the five corresponding flags. First tribe back with the five correct flags in their box wins immunity. Lose-- Tribal Council looms. I'll take my spot. I'll give you a go. For immunity, Survivors ready. Go! Heidi: Tarantula. T-A-R-A-N-T-U-L-A. -Tarantula. -Tarantula. -Tarantula. -Tarantula. -Probst: Tambaqui has one. Piranha. Uh, up. Put... all right, down, down, down. Go over, go over. Jenna: Piranha. Right there in front of us. Probst: Jaburu's got their first. Dave: Did anybody check iguana? Go to the "I" right there. I-G-U-A-N-A. Iguana. Probst: Tambaqui with two. -What does that end in? -Anaconda. Anaconda. Probst: Jaburu gets their second word. -Toucan. -Toucan. Very good. Probst: Tambaqui has three. Underneath the "T" on the bottom. -"T" up, diagonal to... -That is iguana, right? Probst: Jaburu's got three. Heidi: Piranha. It's up here. Piranha. Probst: That's four words for Tambaqui. ROB [whispers]: Taran... [whispering inaudibly] We're all tied up, four-four. -Christy: I see mosquito. -Where? Mosquito, "M," lower corner. "M"... "M"... backwards. Diagonal. -Mosquito. -One, two, three... Five. Probst: Nope, you're not done. Four are right; one word is wrong. -There's no "U" here. -Mosquito is not right. Probst: Jaburu with four right, working on their fifth word. Jenna: Toucan. -Probst: Jaburu has all five right. -Yeah! -Get your flags. -Alex: Get in there, guys. -I got the rope. -Jeanne: What's this? Jaguar is right there. J-A-G-U-A-R-G. -Right? Oh, no. -Dig it out. Jenna: Good job, guys. Anaconda. A-N-A-C-O-N-D-A. Probst: Now you have all five. Moving on. -Remember it, you remember it. -Anaconda. -I got iguana. Probst: Remember, you only need the five flags that match the words. Get them in your tribe color. Get it, Rob. -All right, go. -Then back... -Pass it back. -Back there's anaconda. -Probst: Jaburu has their first flag. Come on, baby. Get it out of there. Go, go, go, go! Probst: Tambaqui with their first flag. Lot of ground to catch up, but you can do it. Alex: Back up. Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up. Can you grab it? Maybe we can go back. All right, you got it? All right, just let... Don't do anything, don't do anything. -Turn around. -Think we ought to back up a little bit. Jaburu with two flags. Probst: Tambaqui with their second flag. [groans] Don't fall in. -Hold on to it first. Hold on. -Got it? -Got it? -Hold on to it. You got it. -Back up. Go. -Great. Back up, back up, back up. Probst: Jaburu with flag number three. Two flags left to Jaburu. Two flags. -Go, go, go, go! -Tambaqui now with three flags. All right, then we'll cut straight over there. Probst: Tambaqui making up a lot of ground. -[frustrated grunting] -Okay. Okay. -You got it? -All right, don't fall in. -Up there, see that? Probst: Jaburu with four flags and the lead. -Heidi: We can do it. -Tambaqui with four flags-- you have one left. A chance to catch up. Jaburu is slowing down. Yeah, this'll be nice and slow on this one so we don't pass it. -Good job, baby. -Here we go. Good job, keep hold of it. Great! All right, forward. Probst: Jaburu has all five flags, heading to the finish. Tambaqui making up a lot of ground. [grunts] Tambaqui with their last flag. It is a race to the finish. So we got it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. We have to tie up the boat. Tie it up. Tie it up, Rob. Tie it up. Let's go, let's go! Probst: All five flags got to be in the box, and all six tribe members have to be here. That's it, Tambaqui, don't quit. One, that's two, that's three, four... Jenna with number five. Jaburu wins immunity! -Yeah! -[cheering] -Oh, yeah! -[shouting, whooping] Jaburu, well earned. Well played. -Yeah! -Nice teamwork. -Yeah! -[whooping] Three more days in the Amazon. Tambaqui, sorry to say, you'll get your first taste of Tribal Council. Somebody's going home. The fun has just begun. Alex: Yes! Jeanne: It's not a fun day today. I didn't think we'd be going to Tribal Council tonight, but we are. And... we have no idea how to vote. Christy and Heidi and myself, we have to vote together. We don't really know these guys that well. We don't know if they have problems with one another or what's going on here. We figure if they vote for one of us and we vote for one of them, then we'll have a... I guess, a tie-off. Christy: Do you really want Dave off our tribe? Heidi: For me, he's the last one I want to go -as far as the guys go. -Why's that? Like you said, I mean, he picked us. I mean, he saw something in us. Jeanne: Well, okay, but before we draw -between... Butch and Roger... -Butch and Roger. ...a-and to this day, everyone always says it was a draw of all three. -Does that sound right? -Yeah. We just took a little boat ride out there and what we decided was to... draw straws-- we put a name on each of the straws and we had to draw one to, uh, vote off tonight. Butch or Roger? Shorter stick goes. Which one's shorter? -That one. Butch. -Butch. Christy: So Butch goes. Jeanne: It was really a toss-up. We wanted to be as fair as we can be. We figured that's probably what they're gonna do, too. Dave: Today was a pisser. Heidi: Long, long pisser. Dave and I went to go pick up some firewood. He just pulled me aside and he's, like, "Uh, you know, I-I definitely want to talk to you about something." Dave: Um, I picked you, because I want to carry you over into the merge. And I talked to Butch and Roger, and you're... I mean, it's gonna be the four of us. And so he just told me, you know, "I really want you to try to be an alliance with the other three guys here," so... It's just the conversation just all of a sudden came up, so that kind of caught me -off guard, actually. -Like, if you were in my position, what do you think you would do? -I'd c... I'd come with us. -You would? We're going with plan A. Jeanne's gone tonight. -Oh, man. -Heidi needs to know that we plan on getting rid of Jeanne first and then Christy. Jeanne was kind of next on the chopping block for Jaburu. So I understand with my vote, I mean, definitely you guys are getting ahead. But if we lose the next two, you know I'm out of here. -You know what I'm trying to say? -I-I... -I won't bull ... you, you know? That's what it is. -I know. I know it is. Heidi: I had a strong alliance with the girls before I came into this tribe. It's kind of like, okay, now what do I do? I mean... I am really in just a rock and a hard stone. I mean, I am just right there. I am, like, the key factor right now to this whole voting process tonight. And I'm incredibly uncomfortable with that. Welcome to your first Tribal Council as the new Tambaqui. First thing I want to know is reaction to the switch of tribes. Jeanne? I was excited for a change, I really was, and the gentlemen here, they were gentlemen, they welcomed us. -It really was great. -Heidi, what does that do to your feelings of the old Jaburu, the women that are still on Jaburu? Heidi: I adore Jenna, so, I mean, I have no hard feelings whatsoever. She made the choice based on what she had to go with. I still love 'em all. I'm glad to be here just as much, though. Probst: Christy, how has your assimilation with this new tribe been? These guys handled it so much better than the girls did when I joined their tribe. They were awesome, and I just really appreciate it. You know, they really would try their best to look at me, and try their best to really include me and not feel like I do have a disability. Which is just... oh, I'm so impressed. Probst: So what do you do now? Somebody's going tonight. What's that gonna be based on, Christy? Alliances. Probst: So do you... look at old alliances and give them a value, or do you say, you know, "I can't, I'm in a new tribe"? Well, it's hard, we've only... I met these guys a day and a half. We didn't really have time to really mingle. I don't know, it is a very hard decision, and yes, it's on numbers, and I'd have to say alliance. You know, alliance is what I can depend on. Probst: Well, alliances give both tribes a 50-50 chance of being the dominant faction tomorrow. -Right. -Right now you're even, three-three. Three women, three men. So, Roger, -how you vote? -It's a new day. I'm gonna vote, uh, who I think is the weakest, uh... weakest link to go on. Probst: So old alliances with the men could be out the window-- if Butch is the weak guy, that's the way it goes. Exactly. Jeanne, how you voting? Weakest link. And alliance. And they both are the same? Mm-hmm. Heidi, how are you voting? I'd say... I mean, yeah. There are so many things running through my head right now. -Give me one. -You know, I mean, it is girls against guys, and then at the same time we're a team. That's just killing me right now. Just, like, you know, head spinning. [laughs] And, uh, it's killing me. It is time to vote. Butch. I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out'll be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... ...Jeanne. Butch. One vote-- Butch, one vote-- Jeanne. Jeanne. That's two. That's two votes-- Butch, two votes-- Jeanne. Jeanne. That's three votes-- Jeanne, two votes-- Butch. Last vote. Fifth person voted out of the Amazon... Jeanne. You need to bring me your torch. Jeanne, the tribe has spoken. So I guess the question is, was tonight's vote based on old tribal gender lines, or, as you guys say, the weak link in a new, big, happy tribe? Guess we'll find out. You can head back to camp. Good night. Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. Probst: Next time onSurvivor... Tambaqui shares a tender moment. Butch: That smile on Christy's face, that's a moment, I'll never forget that as long as I live. Probst: And at Jaburu, Shawna's recovery is sparked by Alex. Shawna: I definitely want to get to know him better. Like, he's an incredible person. At Jaburu, is there romance in the air? Maybe. I guess I wasn't made to play this game, because... I didn't want to lie or cheat, and I know that's how I'm off right now. I played a tough game-- I'm tough, I'm mean, I'm focused I'm determined, but I guess I'm just not a nasty liar. And that's really what you have to be. Good luck to them, because in the game of life, I'm the winner.
