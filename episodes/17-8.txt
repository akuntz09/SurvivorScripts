<br/>Probst: Previously on Survivor: [elephant trumpets] Kota closing in on a big  win! Throughout the game, the yellow tribe Kota has been beating up on the red  tribe Fang. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Kota wins reward! And some of the Kota players have not been gracious winners. <br/>Mmm! [sniffles] Wah, wah, wah. <br/>Randy to me, he's a troll under the bridge that's just mean and angry with  the world. Do not disrespect me like that. <br/>Probst: On day 22, both tribes were invited to eat together...  Chow down, Kenny. <br/>Probst: ...at a feast where Charlie robbed Kenny of a clue to a hidden  immunity idol. <br/>You guys, I feel bad not sharing this 'cause I saw the whole thing. So I feel like you guys should take a look, too. <br/>There is my chance to find the hidden immunity idol for myself, and Charlie  blew it for me. <br/>Probst: The idol was lost when Marcus convinced everyone to toss it away. <br/>These people are so stupid. I got ten people to throw an immunity idol into the ocean. <br/>Probst: At the end of the feast, the tribes were reshuffled. <br/>Congratulations, you have just divided yourself into two new tribes. <br/>Probst: Crystal and Kenny were swapped from the red tribe to the yellow  tribe, where they were outnumbered, but not were outnumbered, but not  outplayed. outplayed. <br/>Really? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Cleverly, they convinced Susie to help them take out Marcus. The tribe has spoken. In one swift move, Kenny and Crystal had knocked out one of their biggest  rivals. Just when you think you're in control of this game, blindside. And after enduring 24 days of grief, life is looking pretty good for the  underdogs. Only nine are left. Only nine are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Ah, Kenny, you impressed me. <br/>Ah, Kenny, you impressed me. All that talking you did. All that talking you did. I'm proud of you, though, that you're coming out of your shell like that. That's great. <br/>Tonight was a huge night for me because it could have been me tonight, and  thank God it wasn't. I learned from Crystal at the last seven Tribals. [laughter] I've been under the radar at Fang in the beginning, and now I have  to stand up for myself. And so far, the last two Tribal Councils I've been to, they've been  blindsides because-because of me. <br/>Well, I bet Marcus didn't see that coming. <br/>No. <br/>The next one to go is Bob. So Bob should be worried right So Bob should be worried right now. now. <br/>If I'm to last, I'm assuming I need to be in a merge. If we're not in a merge, I think I'm history. Even though my-- I teach science. Um, that was a little joke. [theme song playing] Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT CBS PARAMOUNT  NETWORK TELEVISION NETWORK TELEVISION NETWORK TELEVISION âª âª âª [deep growling breaths] [deep growling breaths]  Mm-hmm. <br/>Good thing we're out of rice, nothing to cook. <br/>We're out here, 25th day, and we can't even produce fire, not even any rice  to cook. And I'm hoping for a merge any day. The longer I stay on this tribe, the closer I go to going home. [elephant trumpeting]  Oh, God. <br/>Ooh, he's got a flag or something. Could it be the new tribe flag? <br/>Oh, God, I can't take it anymore. Open the bag. Put it down. <br/>There's a note up here. <br/>Charlie's gonna read it. <br/>Golf, it's golf. <br/>Oh, you're right. <br/>It's a golf flag. <br/>It is a golf flag. Oh, my heart is palpitating. <br/>"It will be fun, long drives and short putts. You may need more practice than anyone thinks. A once-in-a-lifetime cultural trip for those who perform best on the  links."  There's a slingshot. <br/>So we got tree mail this morning, but I was really hoping that it was going  to be merge, something merge-esque, 'cause I want to see Marcus again. Randy, I can't hold it up much longer. <br/>That's not bad. <br/>That's great. [Corinne groans]  The Kota alliance from the get-go is me, Charlie and Marcus. As long as that's intact, I As long as that's intact, I don't really care who  goes home. don't really care who goes home. don't really care who goes home. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Fang getting your first look at the new Kota. Marcus voted out at the last Marcus voted out at the last Tribal Council. Tribal Council. Huge reactions from the Fang tribe. Corinne, you look miserable. <br/>I'm pissed, yeah. He didn't deserve to leave the game. <br/>Then who does? Who does deserve to leave the game? <br/>It's a game. We all deserve it. It's a game. <br/>I know it's a game, but I'm sad. I think a lot of people out here complain a lot. Marcus never did that. He was enjoying every second out here. <br/>I don't understand, I don't understand why he doesn't deserve to leave the  game. <br/>It's not that anyone deserves it. It's just that I think that, uh, he earned his right to be here longer, I  guess. <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes, we are. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, you're going to do a little golfing, Survivor  style. Using a large slingshot, you will aim and shoot your ball toward the hole...  until finally you land your ball in the hole. The tribe with the lowest number of shots wins the hole. The best two out of three wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: You will be taken to a Gabonese village, where you will enjoy a beautiful  dance ceremony, have a nice meal...  Wow. <br/>Probst: ...and spend the night. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: You'll return to camp in the morning. In addition, the winning tribe will send one person from the losing tribe to  Exile Island. Fang, you have one extra member-- sitting somebody out. Who you going to sit out this time? <br/>Is that cool? Okay. <br/>Probst: All right, Corinne, you'll be on the bench. Everybody else, we'll get you Everybody else, we'll get you started. started. Kota has the first shot. 300 yards to the hole, slight downhill grade. <br/>One, two, three. <br/>Probst: Bob launches back. Just over my head. Nice shot. Just shy of 150 yards. Fang is up. Matty launches. <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Another nice shot. Head over. Both drives pretty even. Fang outdrove Kota by just a bit, so Kota will shoot first. <br/>Ready? One, two, three, go. <br/>Probst: Bob launches straight at the hole. And a great kick. <br/>Oh, slow down. <br/>It's all right-- perfect. <br/>Probst: Nice shot by Kota. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Matty back with the second shot for Fang. <br/>No. <br/>Probst: And his shot goes way left. But it gets a pretty good bounce. Ends up about 20 yards from the hole. We are tied. Two shots each. Fang with their third shot. Fang with their third shot. Randy, way short. Randy, way short. Third shot for Kota. Kenny's going to be the shooter this time. Could win the hole right here. And he does it. Kota scores the first point! Moving on to the next hole. Second hole. 225 yards, uphill. <br/>One, two, three. <br/>Probst: Nice shot. Just past the 125-yard marker. <br/>Good job. <br/>Probst: Matty back shooting  Probst: Matty back shooting now for Fang. now for Fang. Nice shot from Fang. Both balls very close. Come on down. Fang, you're furthest out. You'll shoot first. He lets it go. Hits high on the mountain, falls all the way down, just six inches from the  hole. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Nice, nice. <br/>Probst: Kota with their second shot; got to get close. Bob with a decent shot but still about 30 feet away from the hole. <br/>That's all right. We'll get it in. We'll get it in. <br/>Probst: Kota with their third shot. Probably need to get this one in the hole. Kenny gives it a good shot, but it's too long. <br/>It's all right. It's all right, Kenny. <br/>Probst: Fang now with their third shot. Fang needs this to stay alive. <br/>Like that? Go widen out, Charlie, widen out. <br/>Just not too much power. <br/>Just not too much power. <br/>Widen out. <br/>Widen out. <br/>That's it. <br/>Probst: And he does it. <br/>Probst: And he does it. Fang ties it up, 1-1. Fang ties it up, 1-1. This is it. Final hole. 200 yards, uphill. We are tied, one each. Playing to two. Matty launches one. Gets a nice kick. Dead center perfect. Kota's up. Bob launches. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: A huge drive. Nice off the tee box for Kota. Kota! <br/>It's not about deuces. <br/>Probst: Matty, back. Launches a nice one. <br/>It's all right. It's all right. Come on, roll. <br/>Probst: Look at that, kicking all the way back. Decent shot by Fang, in good shape. Kota, you're up. <br/>One, two, three. <br/>Probst: Bob launches. Far to the right, but he's getting a good kick. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Kota in pretty decent shape. Kota now up with their third shot. shot. Winner of this hole wins reward. Winner of this hole wins reward. Kenny just misses. Six inches too far, rolls down the hill, opens the door for Fang. He had to go short, and puts it right on the edge of the hole. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: Big-time pressure on Kota for this shot. Kota, with their fourth shot, knowing that Fang is literally knowing that Fang  is literally on the edge of the hole. on the edge of the hole. Kenny just overshoots it. Matty can win it for Fang right here. <br/>Could. <br/>Charlie, hold it out here. <br/>Okay. <br/>No rush, no rush. <br/>Just drop it way out here, Charlie. <br/>Farther, farther. Matty, don't pull it back. Just set it forward...  Shh! <br/>Please. <br/>Calm down, calm down. <br/>Please. <br/>Go forward. Pull it forward more, Charlie. <br/>Probst: A lot of discussion. They're right on the hole. How can they blow it? <br/>Tension, Randy! Okay, hold on. Stop. We got to...  Can I do it? <br/>No, I got it. No, you can't do it. <br/>Matty, please. <br/>Simmer down, Randy. <br/>Just drop it. No pitching on the court at all. Right now, just drop it! <br/>Shh! <br/>Randy, Randy... We all need to... If we win this, I want to win this happy  and calm. <br/>Please. <br/>I got it, man. <br/>There should be no pitch on it. <br/>I know, buddy. <br/>Then drop it! Let's go home! <br/>Randy, we want to go home happy. <br/>Here we go. <br/>Charlie. <br/>Probst: Fang one big happy tribe, obviously. Fang with the win for reward. This should be a fun afternoon. <br/>We're hungry and tense. <br/>Yes! <br/>Corinne, we won! <br/>Good job. Good job, Bob. <br/>Why are you mad? <br/>There's no need to spring it, man! <br/>I know, but I just...  Randy! Whatever, we won. Chill out! <br/>We did good, bud. <br/>Good Lord! <br/>Probst: Fang, congratulations. You must now choose one person from the Kota tribe to send to Exile Island. <br/>We figure we're going to send Bob. <br/>Probst: Corinne, why Bob? <br/>I just know that he can find the idol, and I wish him the best of luck in  doing that. <br/>Probst: Bob, grab your stuff. Here's a map. Have fun. <br/>Which way do I want to go? <br/>Probst: Straight up there. Bob will return in time for the next immunity challenge. <br/>Bob's never going to find that idol because nobody has that idol but me, and  no matter who gets sent to Exile, the only three people that know are Matty,  Kenny, and Crystal. <br/>Probst: All right, Fang, you will leave from here, be taken straight to your  hard-earned reward. Grab your stuff. Head out. <br/>That was the most anxiety-ridden challenge I've had in this whole competition. I felt like I was going to have, like, four heart attacks. <br/>Matty, I don't know what got into the guy, but what he pulled was ugly. He would not even listen. He would not even listen. It was like The Outer Limits. It was like The Outer Limits. It was like The Outer Limits. âª âª âª [cheering] [cheering]  Arriving to this African village was a surreal feeling. [singing] I am the only Fang member that has been trapped at Fang the entire  game, and, uh, to finally get a reward, the man upstairs is looking out, man,  because I needed it. needed it. [chanting] [chanting] [chanting] [singing] [singing]  All we're thinking is food, but instead, they start beating us with leaves  that are covered in water and, like, stripping our clothes off of us to wash  us down. Like, you felt like a human being again. It was nice. It was nice. It was really nice. It was really nice. And then we went to the next tribal ceremony and this little girl-- she was  very, very cute. She was, like, too small to, like, follow everybody, and, like, hang out so I  paid some attention to her and then she was, like, glued to me. Which was cute, um, but I'd be the last person anyone would think would,  like, chum up to a think would, like, chum up to a two-year-old. two-year-old. <br/>I was stoked when I saw Marcus gone. <br/>I was shocked. <br/>'Cause you were just thinking about the reward. <br/>Well, yeah, we probably would have lost if Marcus was there, probably. <br/>It's crazy how that happened. Ace, Stan, Marcus, boom, boom, boom. The three power players. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Marcus getting voted out is, like, the lowest moment I've had in this game,  because Marcus and I had been playing together since the first day, like, not  just as, like, strategists in this game, but as, like, really good friends. And now with him gone it's like ugh, who do we turn to, because he did a lot  of thinking for us. he did a lot of thinking for us. âª âª  The dancers were great. I kind of got the feeling one of them liked me. I haven't had a girl come on to me in about 20 years, but I think, uh... I  think one of them kind of liked me. I hate to dance. My feet hurt. My knee hurts. My shoulder hurts. And just ate about four pounds of food, but, hell, I danced with her. with her. âª âª  I don't know what came into me, but I was just feeling it and going for it. It was, like, the two cultures colliding with their styles of dance. dance. It was so cool. It was so cool. I think that I will be voted out next, so I'm really nervous. But my main objective was to allow myself a break from the game of Survivor,  and, uh, it gave me some relief that I needed desperately. needed desperately. âª âª âª âª âª  Huh. No, don't get stuck again. No, don't get stuck again. âª âª All I'm doing is going around in All I'm doing is  going around in circles, like an idiot. circles, like an idiot. It's like one of the worst feelings ever. Wait, I know what to do. [grunts] I'm not an outdoors type of guy. At home I usually sit in the room playing video games most of the time. of the time. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. But right now, I'm feeling that I... I'm getting to know how to play this  game more, this game of Survivor. Three fishes. Three fishes. Three tilapias. Three tilapias. Oh, ladies! Fried fish. <br/>Awesome! <br/>That is so cool, Kenny boy! <br/>Bob's at Exile Island, so, therefore, I'm the only man at Kota with two very  beautiful women. <br/>Thank you, Ken. <br/>You did awesome! <br/>Who would've thought the little guy in this game would be the provider for  them. <br/>This is good! <br/>The best fish I've had out here. To me that's a Gabon feast for me. I am very proud of myself for what I've done so far in this game, and if  people want to take me out, I will take them out before they take me out, any  way I can. So, right now, I know for a fact So, right now, I know for a fact that I can  win this game. that I can win this game. that I can win this game. âª âª  "Across the lake you see so well, there lies a sandy crater." Well,  I think I'll go for clue two. I just arrived at Exile and my choice is not to take comfort. I'm going to go for the clue and that's a real clear choice for me because I  am, uh, in deep doo-doo back at camp. Sandy crater. Wow. "Now turn around, go back to the lake. On one tree hill, time for salvation's sake." "Walk along a yonder  creek. Beneath the burnt wood is the thing you seek." Huh. "Through creatures unknown, you'll have to wade, the you'll have to  wade, the deliverance shall be made." deliverance shall be made."  But I don't see it. The first three clues came boom, boom, boom. And this one has got me completely perplexed. I can't think of a leaf that I've left unturned. I have been more than frustrated. Maybe Sugar found the idol. I'm not exactly sure, but I've I'm not exactly sure, but I've got to do  something. got to do something. My plan is to make something that looks like an idol. I found something that looked like a skull, so I took the resin that I found  in one of the trees and glued the front of it with resin, and then taken  knick-knacks that I found knick-knacks that I found around. around. This is my new fake idol. I potentially have an idol that could threaten somebody else in the tribe. It's sort of like when you're holding up a bank; you don't necessarily need  the gun. If they think you got a gun, If they think you got a gun, they might leave  you alone. they might leave you alone. <br/>We got mail! <br/>"Today, it's not important if you're fast or stronger or smarter. To avoid going home tonight, be the best fire starter."  It's individual, it sounds like. <br/>Oh, God, I hope not. <br/>We don't know! Shush up! <br/>It said build a fire? <br/>No, Crystal... there's no way Crystal is gonna start a fire. There's no way Susie's gonna be able to start a fire. There's no way Kenny is. <br/>They could give Crystal a book of matches and gasoline, and she can't start a  fire. We don't know if it's gonna be tribe versus tribe or whether it's gonna be  individual immunity, but there's a merge. And I see Crystal again, I'll puke. I mean, can you imagine the drama if the merge happens and I was forced to  stay with I was forced to stay with Sasquatch, and you know... Sasquatch, and  you know...  Sasquatch is Bigfoot, which is Crystal. <br/>Okay. <br/>Which is also T-Rex. I hated Crystal from the beginning. Everybody knows that. She made her bed back in the old Fang, and I still hold a major Fang, and I  still hold a major grudge. grudge. grudge. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Bob We'll now bring in Bob returning from Exile Island. returning from Exile Island. First things first, Matty, we'll First things first, Matty, we'll take back  the immunity idol. take back the immunity idol. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. Today, tribal immunity is not what you seek. Individual immunity is what you are playing for... because you are no longer  two because you are no longer two tribes. tribes. Drop your buffs. You are merged. [Sugar squeals]  Yes! Awesome! <br/>Whoa! <br/>The merge is a new lease on life for me. I knew my days were numbered. I'm the luckiest guy in Gabon. <br/>Are you okay? <br/>Yeah, I missed you so much. My buddy! <br/>Probst: Matty, here are your buffs. Pass them out. Put 'em on. Pass them out. Put 'em on. <br/>Oh, my God, it's so clean. <br/>Oh, my God, it's so clean. <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready to get to your challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Probst: It is only fitting, as you now enter the individual portion of this  game, that the first challenge should test how well you would do on your own. Today you will make fire. You will each have a flint and steel and a box of fire-making supplies. Your goal: make a fire high enough to burn through your rope. First person to burn through their rope wins immunity and guaranteed a  one-in-eight shot at a million bucks. [whistles] Losers, Tribal Council, where somebody will be voted out and  become the second member of our jury. High enough stakes? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: All right, we'll draw for positions. for positions. We'll get started. We'll get started. Okay, you each have a flint and steel. You got fire-making supplies. Everything you've had at camp from day one. This is for immunity. Survivors ready? Go. Let's see what you've learned in your 27 days in Gabon, West Africa. This is fundamental to being able to survive on your own. And you are on your own in this game now. game now. Randy trying to get a spark. Randy trying to get a spark.

Trying to turn it into a fire that will sustain itself, start to grow. Sugar and Susie both with fire. Somebody else better get in this challenge. [groans] Sugar coming on strong now. <br/>Come on. <br/>So close. <br/>Probst: Susie's fire continues to grow. Nobody else is even in it. <br/>This sucks! <br/>Probst: Sugar with a very impressive fire. If somebody doesn't hurry up, Sugar and Susie are going to be tough to beat. <br/>There we go. There we go. <br/>Probst: They're neck and neck. <br/>Come on, come on, come on. <br/>Probst: Susie getting very close now. Sugar looking very good. <br/>There we go. Now let's get some flames on the... come on, baby. <br/>Probst: Susie's fire is starting to burn high enough now to burn through that  rope. Sugar's fire is up to the rope. Sugar's fire is up to the rope. Both in good position. Both in good position. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Susie wins immunity! <br/>I can't believe it! <br/>Congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Congratulations. Susie is safe tonight at Tribal Council. [applause] Guaranteed a one-in-eight shot at a million dollars. For the rest of you, one of you going home tonight. You will now return to one camp together. You will be going back to what was formally Fang. It is now a new camp. You will have everything you need there to give yourself a new tribe name,  build a new tribe flag. Any personal items, any reward items left back at the old Kota camp will be  waiting there for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you at Tribal. Congratulations. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Finally, we merged, just everybody together, nine of us. But I hated Fang from the beginning. There's no way I'm going back to camp tonight with Crystal. to camp tonight with Crystal. She'll be gone or I'll be gone. She'll be gone or I'll be gone. She'll be gone or I'll be gone. [trumpeting] [trumpeting]  Good to be here. <br/>Welcome back. Congratulations, everyone. I can't believe we've got canned food here. That must be our beans. <br/>I think it's rice. <br/>Oh, good! <br/>Beans or beanie weenie. <br/>Yeah, let's eat it. <br/>The merge totally changed the game. We got back, everybody paid homage to all our new gifts. There was rice; there was canned food; there was beans. There was Gabon pears. There's coffee. But, uh, as soon as that little brief gratitude session was up...  Want to go to the woods? <br/>...people bounced into the jungle and started their strategies, you know. strategies, you know. [exhales sharply] [exhales sharply]  Crystal's the way to go, and I'm voting for Crystal. Don't worry. Bob will vote Crystal. <br/>Yeah, the four of us are on board for Crystal, so we just need Sugar. I feel very confident that Corinne, Bob, Randy, and I are a solid four, and I  feel confident that Matty, Kenny, Susie, and Crystal are a solid four. Then, there's Sugar. <br/>âª Hallelujah. <br/>And she is hanging somewhere in the middle, and she has ties to both sides. But Sugar has a mind of her own and is playing this game own and is playing  this game very differently than all of us. very differently than all of us. very differently than all of us. [squeals] [squeals]  Are we on board? <br/>Yeah, I'm... I can't live with him anymore, and he's going to cause big  problems. <br/>We can do Randy next. <br/>That's what I was saying. I mean, I want you to be comfortable, so I care about your opinion. My whole plan is just to stay on Sugar because she... she is the swing vote. Not only do I have to act interested in what Sugar is saying, but I have to  act like I care about her. <br/>Honestly, will you trust me? Like, it's the best move. <br/>I just know Randy is in a bad spot and he has to stick with us, and I just  want to stay in the game. <br/>It's the Kota foursome to the end. <br/>Sugar is so weak and naive and gullible. I have been nasty to her for 25 days. I was nice to her one day, and she's sold. So it doesn't even make sense, but she buys it because she's such a moron. [trumpets]  Now, listen, listen, Charlie and Corinne are the alliance. <br/>They never, ever, ever break. <br/>So we need to break them. <br/>No, I'm going to tell you right now. Me and... we home, we home. This is some real... this is the realness over here. <br/>Randy is with Kota, too. <br/>Okay, if he's Kota, then you're on their chopping list. <br/>Why? <br/>'Cause Randy. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>No, but listen...  But they... them two got's to be broken up. <br/>Which one? <br/>Corinne and Charlie. <br/>Oh, they both need to go. Corinne can go first. <br/>See, Corinne is just hurting herself with her own personality. <br/>Oh, God, she's horrendous! I can't handle her. She is awful, dude. <br/>[laughing]: I know. <br/>No, really. <br/>Yeah, what about...? <br/>I have a personal grudge against Charlie. At that feast, freaking Charlie took that paper and he made me share it with  everybody. I could have gotten the hidden immunity idol, and nobody would have known,  but no. So I made up this little lie. I said, "Charlie, he's behind the scenes of Kota. He's telling people what to do." But really, no, I made it up, and  everybody listened to me. <br/>Write down Charlie. Write down Charlie, Charlie. <br/>Charlie. <br/>Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. <br/>I'll trade that idol for his life. Serves him right. We got to blindside Charlie first. I'm like a little rat. I go... you know, in the corner, and nobody knows that. You mess with me, then you're You mess with me, then you're gone in this game. gone in this game. Charlie is the brains behind the whole Kota cabana. <br/>Really, it's not...? <br/>It's not Randy and not Corinne. We will get rid of them as soon as we can, but Charlie tells them what to do  and he's the brains behind it. Yes, but he seems nice, but he goes out and talks and whispers to them, and  then they... they be themselves. <br/>Okay. <br/>So once we get rid of Charlie, we can get rid of Randy, Corinne, whoever you  want. <br/>I think I'm the lady of the hour because everybody is telling me who to vote  for and chomping at the bit to, like, get my vote for somebody. Just "You got to vote with us. Get the numbers, blah, blah, blah." So we have to come up with a tribe  name? <br/>N-O-B-A-G. <br/>I like that. Gabon backwards. <br/>The thing is, I don't trust Kenny. He lied to me about Ace. So he could be some evil mastermind. And I don't trust Crystal at all. I certainly don't have any allegiance to Randy and Corinne. So I guess I don't trust any of these guys. <br/>Are we good? <br/>Sure. <br/>Wait-- yeah, yeah, wherever. <br/>I think that's good. <br/>Even though we're one tribe, there is definitely two sides to this tribe, and  both sides of this blue tribe want my vote for another person, so I have no  clue what to do, but I don't owe anything to anybody at all. anything to anybody at all. âª âª  Probst: Now I'll bring in the  Probst: Now I'll bring in the first member of our jury. first member of our jury. Marcus, voted out at the last Marcus, voted out at the last Tribal Council. Tribal Council. So I'll remind you guys, from this point forward, no talking to the jury. They're here to observe. That's it. The game is slowly shifting into their hands. All right, let's start at the reward challenge. Randy, you guys are right on the verge of winning this challenge. All you have to do, literally, is just pick up the ball and drop it in. Where was all that tension coming from when you're on the verge of a win? <br/>Uh, the shot that Matty took, he would make nine times out of ten. If everybody would have shut up and listened to what I was saying, I had a  shot that would have made it ten times out of ten. Nobody would listen, and it was frustrating. <br/>Probst: Charlie, you were seeing that the tribe was starting to break down  and maybe on the verge of blowing an easy win. <br/>Yeah, I was screaming over both of them, "Calm down. Calm down. Let's communicate" because to express your point of view, you need to  communicate it, and I think the communication really broke down, so I hope we  learned from it. <br/>Probst: Randy, you started off on Fang tribe, you went over to Kota, and from  that point forward what I've seen has been, "Don't miss 'em. Didn't like 'em anyway."  Well, since we're putting stuff out on the table, why, why have you got  issues with me? <br/>Why? <br/>Why do you have issues with Crystal? Yes, I would like to know. If I have a problem with anybody, it's clear. It's not any gray area. This is where Crystal stands. <br/>Okay, w-why...? <br/>W-W-Wait, I let you finish. Let me finish. <br/>I never even started. How can you let me finish? <br/>You're opening up your mouth. Let me finish. Now, what is it that I did to Randy for Randy to be bashing Crystal so much  at Kota camp? <br/>Okay, you want a list? <br/>What'd I do to Randy, really? <br/>All right. The first nine days of this game...  Mm-hmm. <br/>...you made Fang a living hell, you and your boy GC. <br/>Okay...  You guys were running... Hey, I let you talk. You going to let me talk or what? <br/>Speak on. <br/>All right. You and your posse ran the tribe like it was a gang. When you guys had power, you guys were arrogant; you were hard to get along  with. You were causing the division in our tribe and were the reason that we lost  all those times. <br/>All right, okay. <br/>Y-You, you want more? <br/>You feel like you have to say some more, we ain't got nothing but time. <br/>Probst: Crystal, you've been pretty vocal, sharing what's on your mind at  times. Ever regret any of your emotions out here? <br/>No, I don't. Yeah, I've cried when I've won. I've cried when I lost. I've been called delusional. But you can guarantee one thing: this is Crystal. What you see is what you get, and if you want the truth, this is Crystal. <br/>Probst: Charlie, would you be a little concerned if you were Randy or  Crystal, people who have been the most vocal tonight firing arrows back and  forth? <br/>I think that if you're just saying something just for your own selfish  reasons to get it off your chest, that doesn't make sense. I definitely think you need to process what comes out of your mouth,  especially in this unique circumstance. <br/>Probst: Kenny, the nine of you, who have been battling for so long, now come  together. Do opinions start to change? <br/>Well, like, with Charlie, for instance, I didn't know too much about Charlie,  and I like Charlie. Just talking with him, I know that he's a nice guy. <br/>Probst: Charlie, has your opinion of Kenny changed now that you've spent some  time with him? <br/>Not at all. I thought Kenny was a great guy when I met him, so my opinion has stayed the  same and I've continued to develop a friendship with Kenny. <br/>Probst: Randy, is there anybody that changed for you? <br/>Yeah, Kenny, he's, he's, he's not a little kid anymore. He's definitely grown up and that's not the Kenny I saw weeks ago. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about your time out here, Sugar. Can it actually be an advantage to have spent so many times away from the  game on Exile because you didn't have the same opportunity to irritate people  that Randy did and Crystal did? <br/>Um, being away from everybody just gives them a chance to talk about me more. I would not annoy everybody. I don't hurt people's feelings and I don't talk crap about people behind  their backs and I have a good idea of who everybody is. <br/>Probst: All right, Susie, you have individual immunity unless you want to  assign that to someone else. <br/>Let me think about that. [laughter] Nope, I'm gonna keep it. <br/>Probst: All right, you cannot vote for Susie. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Randy, you're up. Randy, you're up. Randy, you're up. <br/>[whispering]: Bitch. <br/>[whispering]: Bitch. <br/>[whispering]: Bitch. <br/>[whispering]: Sorry, Charlie. <br/>[whispering]: Sorry, Charlie. <br/>[whispering]: You took out my Marcus, and that makes me really Marcus, and  that makes me really mad. mad. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Crystal. Who cast this vote? <br/>Uh, C.C., Crystal Cox. <br/>Probst: If you don't want somebody to know who you voted for, you got to  write a name down. Otherwise I have to ask. That's two votes Crystal. Crystal. Three votes Crystal. Crystal. Crystal. Four votes Crystal. Four votes Crystal. Charlie. Four votes Crystal; one vote Charlie. Charlie. Four votes Crystal; Four votes Crystal; two votes Charlie. two votes Charlie. Charlie. That's four votes Crystal; three votes Charlie. Charlie. Four votes Crystal; four votes Charlie. four votes Charlie. One vote left. One vote left. Tenth person voted out of Survivor: Gabon and the second member of our jury:  Charlie. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Probst: Charlie, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. <br/>Have fun. <br/>Have fun. <br/>Probst: One thing tonight's Tribal Council made clear to me is that the merge  has had an impact on this game, and it should make for a crazy finish. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

The final three in this game is Kenny, Susie, and Crystal. You're not part of it. <br/>We have to get this right.

But what can you do at this point? And I didn't think I would make it past the first Tribal, so to make it this  far is amazing. If I'm going to leave Survivor, I'm glad it's a blindside. Thank God Marcus is in the jury house. That is my saving grace. I can't wait to see Marcus.
