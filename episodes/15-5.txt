<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor...  Getting past last night's vote was big. <br/>Jeff: Jean-Robert narrowly escaped the vote. <br/>But at he next tribal council I'm not that worried, because Courtney is  always the weak link in every challenge, and if she survives the next tribal  council she's got to be the luckiest she's got to be the luckiest girl in  Survivorhistory. girl in Survivorhistory. <br/>I would prefer if Jean-Robert goes next because he's just so unpleasant. He's, like, a cocky son of a bitch. And he sucks so bad. There's no getting out of that. <br/>Jeff: At Zhan Hu...  I don't know, man, find something, think of something. <br/>Jeff: ...Dave continued to rub people the wrong way. <br/>Thanks for listening. <br/>The same way you do with everybody else. You just listen, listen, listen, right? <br/>Dave's put himself in a weird position with everybody. I mean, he does help around camp, but he's also pissing people off. <br/>Jeff: And Sherea conserved her energy around camp for the challenges. <br/>I'm getting frustrated because Sherea is trying to get away with not helping  out. <br/>I'm going ride the workhorse until the tails fall off, because I'm not doing  anything until I have to. <br/>Jeff: At the immunity challenge... Sherea launches again and scores! Sherea rose to the occasion. But James once again dominated. James connects again! Leading Fei Long to victory. Nobody going home from Fei Long. Back at the Zhan Hu camp, both Dave and Sherea were clearly in trouble. <br/>I think if it were to me, you know, if we could get rid of both of them, it  would be great. <br/>Jeff: But at tribal council, Sherea convinced the tribe of her value. <br/>If we don't save our energy for challenges, we'll never get further ahead in  the game. <br/>Jeff: And Dave paid the price for his abrasive personality. Fourth person voted out of Survivor: China,Dave. 12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK  TELEVISION TELEVISION TELEVISION  Oh, we slept in. <br/>Oh, we slept in. <br/>With Dave out of the picture, everybody's just kind of peaceful, just  chilling. You know, we sleep late and then we have a lot of relaxation time. <br/>You okay? <br/>Losing is so boring, because we've already done it so much. I want to do something different. We should have a really strong team now. But the problem is Fei Long, they also have a very strong team. They're well led by Aaron. They've got the strongest player, James, and some very intelligent people. So they're a hard team to beat. <br/>I think as long as, like, we, all, like, work together, like, equally in  every aspect, that way we're all strong here. We're all strong at challenges. It sounds like that's what that other tribe is doing. I mean, it helps that they have James, but...  I definitely feel like the outsider in the tribe just because the four of  them kind of clique up sometimes. So I want to spice things up. I want some drama or something going on. I'm really looking for forward I'm really looking for forward to something  changing. to something changing. <br/>I wouldn't mind going by Taylor. <br/>That's a cool name. <br/>I like Taylor. <br/>I have a friend named Taylor. <br/>Really? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Jaime and are kind of in the Garden of Eden setting, minus all the fruit. It's biblical in the sense that there's man and woman and we like hanging out. What's yours? <br/>Nicole. <br/>Jaime Nicole Dugan. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>That's a nice little sweet, Southern name. <br/>Yep. Erik and I have known each other, like... I guess it's 13 days now. I don't know what's wrong with him. I can't find anything wrong with him so far. He's really attractive. <br/>I like you a lot, so...  All right. <br/>I just want to get my thoughts out, just to know that I've said it. I don't know. I just... I'm a virgin. <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah. A few years ago I was like, "I'm not ready." And I said it was  because I was too young, but it was really because I think I wasn't finding  the right person. <br/>I think it's great that Erik is still a virgin, you know. I think it does prove that he's even more trustworthy than I even thought  before. So I'm trying to make it with So I'm trying to make it with him all the way  through. him all the way through. <br/>Yeah. The new word on the street is that there's an immunity idol, and Jaime wants  to entrust me with the information. That's going to hopefully help in the game. I don't know what's going to happen with Jaime and I's relationship, but she  seems like a good all-around person to be aligned with right now at this  aligned with right now at this stage of the game. stage of the game. <br/>It's going to be another hot one, guys. <br/>Another glorious morning here  Another glorious morning here in China. in China. <br/>I am carrying most of the tribe's weight as far as work and the challenges,  but Denise really does bust her ass out here. She's the other one that really pulls the rope around here. I mean, you can't beat that. I like women like her. She's a strong, good woman. She's there to complement you and work with you. That's attractive. I like that. If Denise was ten years younger or if I was older, whichever way, Denise  would be in trouble. Yeah. Damn, that's enough to eat. <br/>We should have brought a bucket and filled it up with some water. Right now the person I trust most is James. Him and I get along very well. <br/>You think this rice will work? They like rice. <br/>He picked up on my work ethic. I've picked up on his. Him and I seem to have a little Him and I seem to have a little connection  going. connection going. <br/>I can trust him and know I can stick with him and ride his coattail as Long  as I can. <br/>James, how is our breakfast coming along, boss? You're the cook. You're the cook. You cook, and we eat. You cook, and we eat. <br/>Someone's coming in. <br/>Oh, no, you guys. Something's going on. <br/>Ni hao. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Hello, hi. <br/>Is that for us? <br/>Hi, thank you. <br/>Hello. <br/>Hi. We have a message, guys. Should we read it? Uh-oh, hold on, hold on. Okay. "Fei Long, choose the two warriors from Zhan Hu who you feel could best  help strengthen your tribe, win challenges and avoid tribal council. Circle their names below. This fisherman will get your new tribe members and bring them back to your  camp."  Oh, my god. <br/>Well, what's the catch? <br/>Well, the catch will probably be that they get to pick two of ours, and  they're going to pick, obviously, like, you and James, Aaron. <br/>But, I mean, it's not about strength all the time. <br/>It pretty much is about strength. <br/>I think someone's going to get switched for sure on our tribe. I think that they're probably going to have a note quite similar that says,  you know, "Circle two people from the other tribe that you think will  benefit yours, and they are now part of your tribe." I don't know. But the situation at camp right now is we have to pick two members from the  other tribe. <br/>Okay. Do you want to have just have everyone have just who their number one pick  would be? <br/>Frosti. <br/>Frosti. <br/>Frosti. <br/>I'd say Frosti. <br/>Okay, Frosti is the number one pick. <br/>Do you think it's Frosti and Sherea? <br/>I think that's a smart move. <br/>All right, do it up. <br/>Okay, fine. <br/>Frosti and Sherea. <br/>All right. <br/>We think that Frosti and Sherea will benefit our camp because they're both  tough, they're both strong and fast, and, you know, they seem like good  people. But it's kind of crazy. It's almost like everything you've devised has to be put on pause for a few  minutes while you figure new things out. <br/>James, if they get the same  James, if they get the same note, they are 100% picking you. note, they are 100% picking you. <br/>"Zhan Hu, choose the two warriors from Fei Long who you think can best  help to strengthen your tribe. Circle their names below. This fisherman will go get your new tribe members and bring them back to your  camp."  So we're getting two people. That means we'll have, what, seven? <br/>We'll have seven. That is the craziest thing I have ever heard. <br/>That is messed up. <br/>Oh, my god, they're going to be so pissed. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, my god, now Zhan Hu is going to have seven and Fei Long is going to have  five. I mean, it's crazy. It's going to really cripple the other tribe. I mean, it's huge. Power really shifted to our tribe today with that crazy twist. <br/>James. I call James. <br/>James is number one. We all call James? <br/>James. <br/>Please. <br/>So none of the women. We don't want any of the women. <br/>I think we should get Aaron and vote him off. That would be kind of dirty, but...  Yeah, if we got Aaron then we would be able to vote him out. <br/>We could just vote him off. If we lose he would be the first one to go and we don't have to worry about  us. <br/>I'm ready to do it. Let's do it. <br/>Aaron? <br/>Go. <br/>James and Aaron. Let's flip it around. <br/>Come on, guys. Zhan Hu! <br/>Zhan Hu and Fei Long just flipped. We're now seven-five instead of five-seven. And we have a huge advantage. We have all the strongest players. So it's looking really good for us. <br/>All right, come on, guys. <br/>All right, come on, guys. Zhan Hu! Zhan Hu! <br/>Here they come. <br/>Is it them? Should we go down and welcome them? <br/>Yes. <br/>Are they waving? <br/>No. <br/>I'm waving, though. <br/>They're pissed. They're totally pissed that we picked them. <br/>Is that them standing? <br/>No, I don't see anybody standing. They're probably sitting down. <br/>This is so weird. <br/>What? <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Apparently that wasn't the end of the twist. Seems Fei Long picked two people from Zhan Hu, and those people were Sherea and  myself. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>I don't even know what to say. <br/>I don't, either. <br/>What are we going to do? <br/>It never crossed my mind that they were going to take two of us. We were just like, "Oh, we get to have two strong people." We  didn't think about it at all. That was really dumb. <br/>Whatever we're going to do, we're just going to do our best to stay in it,  you know. No matter what happens, you guys have control of the two biggest players in  the game, so remember that. <br/>So use it to your advantage. <br/>I'll miss you. <br/>I'll miss you, too. <br/>I'll miss you, too. <br/>See you soon. <br/>See you soon. <br/>Bye, guys. New adventure. <br/>Yep. <br/>Yep. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Yeah. <br/>These are different drivers, you guys. They're here to get two of us. <br/>Yep. <br/>Ni hau. <br/>Ni hau. <br/>Okay, here we go. <br/>Thank you. It says, "Fei Long, if it is your name that is circled, pack your  personal belongings and go with this fisherman to join your new tribe at Zhan  Hu." Aaron, James. <br/>They have a pretty sweet team  They have a pretty sweet team now. now. <br/>What are we going to do without you people? <br/>What are we going to do without you? <br/>We've got a great camp, we've got such great momentum, and we've been such a  great force on this team, and now we're switching and everything is messed up. <br/>I can't stand it, losing our two strongest warriors. <br/>I thought you were our strongest warrior, big boy. <br/>Yeah, you're Jean-Robert. Yeah. <br/>Bye, Amanda. <br/>Bye. <br/>Bye, Todd. <br/>Take care. Be good. <br/>Man, I just fixed my part of the bed. I don't have any ties, anything with Aaron. Going over to Zhan Hu, I'm pretty much by myself now. I'm starting all over again. I'm going to have to work my way into the system again. <br/>We're giving up our two strongest warriors, Aaron and James. If that's not bad enough, James is one of my strongest allies in this whole  game. <br/>Bye, guys. <br/>Bye-bye. <br/>I was a little upset. I mean, I've been getting along with James. James works around here. But, you know, I mean, things change. Things change for the good, things change for the bad. <br/>That means that Jean-Robert is going to have to actually move his ass and get  water. <br/>We should probably talk about, before those guys get here, what our plan is  going to be. <br/>I say we don't even think about it until we lose. <br/>I agree. <br/>No, I say we have to think about it, because it's not something we can talk  about when they're here. If it came down to it, at first tribal council we go for Sherea and then we  go for Frosti. <br/>Totally. <br/>Sounds good to me. <br/>The popular thing would be, "Well, you know, Jean-Robert, yeah, yeah,  yeah..."  Why do you say that's the popular thing, Jean-Robert? <br/>I'm just saying that...  No, really, Sherea is.. <br/>I know that you guys are smart players and everything. I'm just saying that...  Right now we get rid of them. <br/>Right now, I think that's the important thing. <br/>Todd and Courtney and Amanda, who knows? They may just decide, "Let's get rid of Jean-Robert." Today is a  terrible day for Fei Long, and today is a god-awful Long, and today is a  god-awful day for Jean-Robert. day for Jean-Robert. <br/>James and I are going to Zhan Hu. We just switched tribes. And I'm ready. <br/>We're going to have to make this work, dude. <br/>We're going to be fine, dude. <br/>I'm chillin'. <br/>We're cool. We're going in with only two people, you know, and they have three. So it is a cause for, like, some apprehension on my part. Where is their hut? <br/>Here they are. Ahoy. <br/>Good to have you guys. <br/>Who knew? <br/>Good to see you. Welcome. <br/>What are you guys, swimming? <br/>Give me a hug. <br/>Hi. <br/>No way! <br/>Yes! <br/>My god! <br/>We have alcohol! <br/>When Aaron and James came over, they brought a little bounty with them. It was a big basket full of different fruits and nuts. <br/>Did y'all think it was going to be you two? <br/>We knew it was going to be James. [ laughter] We didn't know who else it would be. <br/>Zhan Hu is going to be a little bit harder. All my people are over there on Fei Long. These people are all happy. Everything is relaxed. My people are miserable over there. I like misery. <br/>Y'all are now yellow. <br/>It's crazy seeing you guys yellow. <br/>It's weird, like, y'all are on our side now. <br/>Who is the brain out of the group? <br/>Actually, we all are. We're all, I mean...  We are in different ways, sort of. <br/>Me and her do puzzles for fun and stuff like that back home. <br/>I can do puzzles. <br/>Strategy. <br/>As far as us three are concerned, we all are kind of balanced. <br/>Tomorrow y'all really need to pull this off. I'll make water, I'll get everything done, because I'm used to doing that  anyway. Y'all focus on what y'all need to do tomorrow to gets things ready, get  yourself focused to win. <br/>Of course James and Aaron know they're on the chopping block, so they're  definitely trying to fire us up for winning the challenges. <br/>Make a toast to the new Zhan Hu. May we prevail. We have control over the two strongest guys right now in the game. I mean, it's a major advantage. It's just what we choose to do with it. with it. <br/>Thank you for welcoming us. <br/>Thank you for welcoming us. <br/>Here they come. <br/>We've got to stick together now. <br/>All right. <br/>Hey, guys. <br/>Hey, guys. <br/>Hello! <br/>Hello. <br/>Hello. <br/>Welcome! <br/>Welcome to Fei Long. <br/>You guys are Skinny Minnie. <br/>The fact that Frosti and Sherea are coming over to our side is kind of  exciting, because I may be able to get great bonds with them. So who knows what I can build there? <br/>It's a basket of food! [ cheering] [ cheering]  Let's celebrate, guys! <br/>Let's celebrate, guys! <br/>Coming over to Fei Long, I feel like I'm starting over, you know, in the game  all over again. So I'm going to do my best to try to get to know them and try to find my  place and fit in. <br/>Pop open one of those bottles. <br/>Welcome, tribe members. <br/>Welcome, you guys. <br/>My position at Zhan Hu was not secure in the fact that I wasn't the hardest  worker at camp. So I'm hoping over here that they kind of see me in a different light, and  maybe I can, you know, step it up some. <br/>We don't have any cooks. <br/>I can cook a little something-something. <br/>I'll try and bring back clean fish, and you can cook something. <br/>I can't believe I'm here. This place is so different. <br/>Really? <br/>This is a dangerous place for me. Things are really messed up now. <br/>I really wanted to see you guys' camp. I just didn't know it was going to be permanent. I'm out of my comfort zone, obviously, because I'm outnumbered by old Fei  Long members with Sherea. My first goal is to figure out what's going on around here, what kind of  alliances I can sense, just see where I can put myself that's going to keep  me myself that's going to keep me around. around. <br/>Get a little rice going here. This morning I just felt like giving us a little bit of a head start because  we lost our sous chef, Aaron and James. So I decided to come out here and just try to build a fire. And since I got the fire going, I might as well start getting I might as well  start getting the rice going. the rice going. <br/>I know. Who is going to have to argue with him now, though? I don't want to argue with him I don't want to argue with him anymore. anymore. <br/>Waking up to everybody bashing Jean-Robert was better than the food that we  got the night before. To me, that just makes me so much more comfortable knowing that there's  somebody here they already have problems with. So it's looking like Jean-Robert is in a bit of a pinch. <br/>I'm going to go check the traps for shrimp. I started the rice. I mean, the rice is basically done. <br/>Jean-Robert woke up early this morning, which he never does, and he started  cooking breakfast for everybody. He's trying to save his butt right now. <br/>Denise, if you want, maybe we  Denise, if you want, maybe we can set out that second net. can set out that second net. <br/>What's that? <br/>I'm not the tribe leader. I don't want to be tribe leader. I'm just saying what I want to do. <br/>Huh? I'm not handing out any orders. <br/>Okay. <br/>I just asked for help with  I just asked for help with the setting out of the net. the setting out of the net. <br/>Thank you. Sherea can cook. That's going to be real helpful for us. Maybe you can make some sort of, like, sardine fried rice for Todd to start  out with, and I'll bring back shrimp, and then you can make shrimp fried rice. That would be great. <br/>Morning. <br/>Morning, everybody. <br/>Morning, everybody. Welcome to Fei Long. Welcome to Fei Long. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. <br/>Seems like right now, Jean[1]Robert  is the one that gets on everybody's nerves. I definitely believe this could be the opening for me with the way they kind  of don't get along with Jean-Robert as great for everybody. I'm definitely going to try to I'm definitely going to try to make my way in  there. make my way in there. <br/>That looked really cool when you guys pulled up, all, like, chilling on top  of that boat. <br/>Yeah. Yeah, it was beautiful. We've got a super tribe right here. <br/>Yeah, we do. <br/>I mean, there isn't any reason why we shouldn't win again and again and again. <br/>Yeah. <br/>This is Zhan Hu. This is my new tribe. Erik and Peih-Gee and Jaime, they're really awesome people, you know? And they're really solid. <br/>This is so much fun. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>I couldn't imagine a better way to spend the summer. I feel comfortable here. I don't know how James feels, but we'll see. <br/>James is amazingly...  He's, like, the powerhouse. Yeah. That's why... he's pretty much the catalyst and why we're winning these  challenges. You know, the only thing is that, yes, James is good here. When we go to the merge, bad. Yeah. Everyone has to consider how great of an athlete that James is. You know, and when there is a merge that comes, you know, how dangerous he  could be if he's a... what they call an immunity hog. All of us are pretty much equal. James is physically a little bit more than us. That is strategy talk. That was a subtle card I played, you know, just to save my butt just in case  we do lose an immunity. <br/>Aaron, okay, say we merge and Jean-Robert is still left, would he be the  first person once we he be the first person once we merged that you'd vote  off? merged that you'd vote off? <br/>Let me think about that. <br/>Aaron's smart. He's athletic, he's good[1]looking,  which always helps people like you a little more. <br/>I don't know, you know? <br/>But I think Aaron is a little bit crafty. He's probably holding a little bit back. Now that we have Aaron and James over here, Frosti and Sherea are over at the  other camp. I don't know how long members of my original alliance are going to last over  there. So definitely I'm going to try to pull Jaime aside and have a talk with her,  see what she talk with her, see what she thinks of everything. thinks of everything. thinks of everything. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. How did you feel, Todd, when Frosti and Sherea showed up? <br/>You know, Frosti and Sherea are great, so I thought they were a good asset to  our tribe. I mean, we did lose two strong, awesome people, but we also gained two people  that I'm sure are going to fight hard. <br/>Jeff: Aaron, is this a good move for you? <br/>It puts us on the chopping block as new members. We really have to put up or shut up right here in this challenge and make it  happen, and win. If you win, you don't go home. <br/>Jeff: Are you guys ready to get to your first challenge as new tribes? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Jeff: First things first. Amanda, give it up. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, two members of each tribe will swim out to a platform. You will then alternate diving into a water, where you'll find a cage filled  with 12 disks representing the signs of the Chinese zodiac. To release those disks you have to remove as many bamboo poles as possible  before resurfacing. You'll then put all 12 disks in a boat and swim to shore. The three remaining tribe members will then match each disk to its  corresponding spot on the board by twisting it and turning it until they lock  into place. First tribe to finish wins immunity, safe at least one more night here in  China. Losers, tribal council, somebody will be voted out. Fei Long, you have two extra members, sitting two people out. Who's it going to be? Amanda and Courtney. Take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to figure out who your swimmers are  going to be, we'll swimmers are going to be, we'll get started. get started. Erik and Aaron swimming for Zhan Hu, Frosti and Jean-Robert for Fei Long. Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Swim, guys. <br/>Swim, guys. Swim, swim, swim! Swim, swim, swim! <br/>Jeff: You need to get as many sticks out in one breath before switching out. Go! Jean-Robert is in for Fei Long. Jean-Robert is in for Fei Long. Aaron in for Zhan Hu. Aaron in for Zhan Hu. Aaron is up. Jean-Robert is up. Got to get back to the mat before the next guy can go. Go! Go! Go! Go! The longer you stay under, the more sticks you can pull out. <br/>Go, Jean-Robert! It broke a little bit of my It broke a little bit of my heart to say that. heart to say that. <br/>Jeff: Both tribes pretty even at this point. With each dive it's getting more and more difficult. and more difficult. Deepest one's about 12 feet. Deepest one's about 12 feet. Erik really winded. Getting very hard for people to breathe. <br/>Boys, take your time and just get your breath first. Wait a minute. Wait a long minute. [ laughs]  Focus, children. <br/>Focus on what? <br/>Something. Focus on thinking of the things we have to...  The puzzle? <br/>The puzzle? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Getting down to the  Jeff: Getting down to the last few sticks. last few sticks. <br/>I got one. <br/>Jeff: Zhan Hu thinks they have all 12. Got to get them in the boat and drag it to shore. Frosti down for a long time. <br/>Got them all. Come on, Jean-Robert! Grab the disks! <br/>Jeff: Got to have 12 disks. Make sure you do. <br/>Put them all in the boat. Come on, Frosti! <br/>Come on! <br/>Jeff: Boat going in the water. Aaron and Erik heading back. <br/>Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on. Swim it in! Swim it in! Come on, guys. <br/>Jeff: Fei Long has all 12. Jean-Robert pulls the boat in the water, nearly loses the disks. <br/>Nothing spilled out, right? <br/>No. <br/>Jeff: It's a race back to shore. <br/>Come on, y'all  Aaron with the rope in his  Aaron with the rope in his teeth, man. teeth, man. <br/>Jeff: Zhan Hu back first. Got to get it up on that mat. You're good! Take over! Get those disks up on to your mat before you can start on the puzzle. Zhan Hu starts to work on the puzzle. Jean-Robert completely exhausted. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: Got to get all 12 pieces before you can reveal the puzzle board. It is now a race between Todd, Sherea and Denise, James, Peih[1]Gee  and Jaime. <br/>Got one. <br/>Got one, guys. <br/>They fit. <br/>Jeff: Fei Long making up a lot of time. They're now in the lead. Jaime appears not to be concerned at all. You'd never know there was anything on the line. Denise, Sherea, Todd working as hard as they can. <br/>Here we go. <br/>Jeff: They've locked in five pieces. Zhan Hu still with one. <br/>They have to fit on, y'all. They have to fit on like this. <br/>The red. <br/>Jeff: Fei Long working very well together. Nobody on this tribe wants to go home. Peih-Gee, you good at puzzles? <br/>I'm good at sudoko. <br/>[ bleep] sudoko. Pay attention. <br/>Jeff: Fei Long getting very close to winning this challenge. Only two pieces left. <br/>Switch, switch, switch. <br/>Get it on! Get it on! <br/>Jeff: Fei Long wins immunity! <br/>Good job, guys. Good job. <br/>Jeff: Zhan Hu, your extra piece that really didn't come piece that really  didn't come into play anyway. into play anyway. <br/>Jeff: Fei Long, congratulations once again. Immunity going home with you. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Jeff: Zhan Hu, definitely the worst performance at a challenge yet. Had a big lead from Aaron and Erik, and Jaime, Peih-Gee, and James completely  blew it. Tribal council tonight. Somebody going home. Grab your stuff. Grab your stuff. Head on back to camp. Head on back to camp. Head on back to camp. <br/>Ah! <br/>Ah! <br/>You can't handle pressure. Like, I hollered at you. And the puzzle girl, the one we relied on, the brains of the thing, she  completely cracks and starts talking about soduko. And that's funny. And then everything is funny. <br/>It's not, like, a logical kind of puzzle. I mean, that's why. I thought it, like, was a logical... you just had to sit and, like, try them  all out. <br/>Talking about soduko! <br/>Jeff asked me a question. What was I going to do, ignore him? <br/>Yes! Yes! Was Jeff's question that important, or winning the challenge? Now somebody's ass got to go home. If you don't focus, I don't want to hear it. Especially during the game. You're still not focusing? Oh, goodness, gracious! Y'all two guys need to figure out which one of these girls is going home,  because we need a strong team. Y'all can play high school if y'all want. That's all I'm going to say. I'm not babysitting a bunch of children who just don't want to do nothing and  be funny during a challenge. Them girls are about to go thirsty, because I just can't support people who  ain't going to try. So they might as well send me home, you know, or cut one of home, you know,  or cut one of those girls. those girls. those girls. <br/>What's up, dude? <br/>What's up, dude? <br/>Were they doing that in the other challenges? I mean, like, she's supposed to be good at puzzles, and...  Oh, she completely dropped the ball. the ball. <br/>They always put her in there. <br/>They always put her in there. <br/>I think I just want go and freakin' just try and get it out of them. <br/>Go talk to them. <br/>Go talk to them. <br/>They're right there. <br/>Hi. <br/>Hi. <br/>What the hell was that? <br/>Are they kicking one of us out, you think? <br/>We threw the challenge. <br/>I mean, I wouldn't have done it...  I mean, I was laughing during the whole thing. I threw one of our pieces to the other side. <br/>Wait a minute, what? <br/>Could you not tell we were throwing it? <br/>The two girls, they basically threw it, you know, on purpose. I didn't know that the girls were going to throw it. That puts me in a really tough position. I'm forced to... in this situation, to stick with them. Unfortunately, I'm really having to trust them a lot, so I'm a little worried  about that. I mean, I trust you still, and I really, really want to keep trusting you,  you know? <br/>Yeah, definitely. <br/>Because I honestly want you and I to stick together...  I think we should. <br/>...all the way to the finish, really. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I just don't like losing, especially on purpose, but I want to remain in  alliance with Jaime, just because it's safe for now at least. Do we definitely vote off James Do we definitely vote off James tonight? tonight? <br/>Well, that's the thing. <br/>Would you rather...  James is the one that was...  Pissed. <br/>Pissed. <br/>Talking. <br/>Talking. I don't know why. <br/>Okay. <br/>Aaron and James definitely are on the chopping block. One of them's going home. I just can't believe they didn't figure it out. I mean... I trust James more than I do Aaron for the simple fact that I think  Aaron's made enough alliances on the other side where he thinks he's set over  there. And I think James probably didn't have quite as many ties at Fei Long. So Aaron will be the first to get kicked off. <br/>I don't know. I'm still shocked we lost so I'm still shocked we lost so bad. bad. <br/>Aaron really deserves to stay. <br/>Yeah, send my ass home. <br/>Well, originally we had agreed the first one to go was going to be Aaron from  the get[1]go. And we thought that we might be able to get James onto our side. I think after what happened today, he doesn't trust us at all, which means  that tonight at tribal council, we probably will have to get rid of James. have to get rid of James. <br/>Who are you guys voting? <br/>Who are you guys voting? <br/>The girls said James, man. So I feel like I have to go with what they say. <br/>Right. I don't trust, really, anyone here on Zhan Hu. You know, I'm on the chopping block, and James is on the chopping block. But I think James is going to go home. So at tonight's tribal council, I am going to vote for James. Just so I won't have to vote for Peih-Gee or I won't have to vote for Jaime  or anything like that, so there's no hard feelings or any kind of vendettas,  you know. any kind of vendettas, you know. So we'll see what happens. So we'll see what happens. <br/>Jeff: So let's talk about the switch. Jaime, what rationale went into picking James and Aaron? <br/>We wanted to break the other team, and by taking their two strongest they  would be pretty bad off. <br/>Jeff: Aaron, was this good news for you, or was this, "Oh, man,  everything's going so good at Fei Long"? <br/>Everything was going great at Fei Long. We were a really strong tribe. We had posted a winning record. And coming over here, we're the new people, where it's three against two. And to lose immunity was a big deal for us. <br/>Jeff: I've got to say, we're at tribal council, the place where most anybody  in this game never wants to go, and Jaime's smiling, got a little...  Yeah. <br/>I'm not happy that I'm here, but I'm not trying to be all pissed off about  it, either. <br/>She has the numbers and she's chillin'. <br/>Jeff: What happened at the challenge, Jaime? I've been around a little bit in this game. It appeared to me as though you had no concern about winning. <br/>You know, if we merge we're gone. They've got the numbers. As far as I'm concerned, I don't want to be stuck with someone that was going  to go right back to the other side. <br/>Jeff: So I'm judging by the lack of performance at today's challenge you've  decided you can't trust Aaron and James, and you threw the challenge. you threw the challenge. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Jeff: So Peih-Gee, the big assumption you're making is what? <br/>Frosti and Sherea get voted off, and then suddenly we merge, guess what? Now there's only three original Zhan Hu members, seven Fei Long. Hmm, I wonder who the next three to get picked off are going to be? <br/>Jeff: James, this must drive you nuts to watch people come into a game that's  really about winning, and see them continually lose, and then today willingly  lose. <br/>And they're happy. They're smiling. I could never do that. <br/>It's about winning the war. It's not about winning the battles. <br/>You're not winning nothing. You ain't...  James...  Then they asked me if I could stay. That's the funny... ask them. Ask them. <br/>I asked which one of you guys wanted to stay the most. <br/>What kind of sense does that make? What kind of dumb do you take me for? That's why they lose. I told you all how I was going to work. I can't work with losers. I can't do it. <br/>Jeff: So James, does that mean it's you tonight? <br/>It should be. They know how I am about this losing thing. They know how I am about not going 100%. I can't just sit here and just watch these people dictate what I'm going to  do. But I really don't want to go. I love being here. I love being here and interacting and all this stuff, but I just can't take  another loss like that. <br/>Jeff: Aaron, what about you? Do you plead your case and say, "Well, I'd like to stay two more days,  three more days, whatever you'll have me"? <br/>You know what? I want to be here as long as possible. I want to compete in every challenge. I want to be part of a team. I want to last as long as I can. <br/>Jeff: So you feel comfortable that you're okay tonight. <br/>I feel comfortable that I'm okay tonight, but I brought my bag anyway. <br/>Jeff: Well, it's been pretty clearly established that it's going to be Aaron  or James tonight. So let's end the mystery and see who gets the guillotine. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Erik, you're up. Erik, you're up. <br/>I wish I was sending all three of those home. three of those home. It's good to do battle with you. It's good to do battle with you. <br/>This is because I'm sticking with my original teammates. with my original teammates. That's all I'm going with. That's all I'm going with. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the  Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. council area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote, Peih-Gee.

You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Take care, guys. <br/>Take care, guys. <br/>Jeff: Aaron, the tribe has spoken. spoken. It's time for you to go. It's time for you to go. Well, Jaime, Peih-Gee, Erik, you three are making a very strategic play. If your assumptions about the game hold true, it could be a good play. If your assumptions are wrong, could be trouble. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night.

I thought it was going to be James over me, and I just wanted to say to  James, I had a great time slipping into battle with you. And I don't know what's going to happen to you, buddy, but I'd rather still  be there on that island with those people even though I don't like them  anymore though I don't like them anymore than be here talking about it.
