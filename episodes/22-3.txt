<br/>Episode 3 -  <br/>Jeff: previously on "Survivor": 18 people began  the game. Two played before, Boston Rob and Russell hantz. Together these two offer 156 days of "Survivor  "Experience. There's a new twist: redemption island. You're sent here when you're voted out. Francesca was first. She was miserable. <br/>Oh! God. <br/>Jeff: living alone, waiting for the next person to arrive. At the zapatera tribe, Russell told everyone that he had  changed. <br/>I'm not here to sabotage anything from nobody. <br/>Jeff: he lied. <br/>I have to build trust with these guys for me to stab them  in the back. <br/>Jeff: Then he made an alliance with the two youngest women  on the beach. <br/>Krista and stefanie are my two girls. <br/>Jeff: And went hunting for the hidden immunity idol, but  it was Ralph who found it. <br/>Russell, eat your heart out, man. <br/>Jeff: zapatera wins immunity! Despite the loss, Rob was still in control. <br/>It is unbelievable how well he can play this game. <br/>Jeff: But then, Rob took his game to an even higher level. <br/>The wheels are in motion for everything to happen. <br/>Jeff: So he convinced Phillip to be a decoy and pretend he  was being voted out. <br/>You're an actor, bro. You need to feel like you're going home. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: And he let Kristina think if she didn't play her  immunity idol, she would go home. <br/>I'm playing it for sure. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, everything went as planned. <br/>Jeff, I think I'm going to need a little extra help  tonight. <br/>Jeff: Allowing Rob to break up a potentially powerful  alliance between Andrea and Matt. Matt, the tribe has spoken. Matt was completely blindsided. Now he heads to redemption island to take on Francesca in a  duel, leaving Andrea wondering where she stands with Rob. <br/>What's up? <br/>Matt? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm shocked. <br/>Yeah, I am, too. A little shocked. <br/>Wow. Wait a second. Why are you here instead of Phillip? <br/>Well, that's... That's an excellent question. <br/>Wow. So Matt got blindsided. I thought that seeing any part of Rob's alliance tonight was an  impossibility. So I just knew it would be Phillip. <br/>I don't have any of my stuff at all. I was completely blindsided. <br/>He's a...  Scoundrel. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Yeah. I feel sick to my stomach right now. Like, it really... It really hurts. I mean, there's a little anger. I don't know, I guess I just trusted boston too soon. I feel like such a goober now because I look like an idiot. Everything was great at camp. Everyone was getting along and then waah. This is brutal. It's definitely hard to come here and pick yourself up after  you've been as blindsided as I was. At the same time, what an opportunity. To be the underdog and come back from redemption island and  finish this game with a million dollars. <br/>How good did that work out tonight? <br/>Tonight could not have gone any better. Not only do we blindside Matt. We were able to have Kristina get rid of her immunity idol, and Phillip  was a loyal soldier. First of all, you get the academy award or the emmy? <br/>I get the academy, huh? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It was nice. <br/>Wow. That's cool. You won't see any flip-flopping here. When I shake-- when I do that right there, my word is my bond. <br/>Tonight I'm sitting in a good spot in this tribe, but  tomorrow morning when I get up, I need to get Andrea feeling okay about  everything because she's smart enough to know that we double crossed her, and  she will definitely hold that resentment. <br/>Open it up. <br/>Okay. "Follow the path to the arena where you will compete in a  duel. The winner of the duel will continue to live on redemption  island and await your next opponent. The loser goes home this time for good."  This time for good. Apparently we're going to have an arena duel somewhere. <br/>Tree mail. This one's going to be an interesting one. <br/>"Today you won't be competing. Choose two who will get a chance to see what happens when you  let your guard down at a place which you don't want to be, redemption island. Each of you will reach into the bag and take one  stone."  Okay, white. <br/>"If you choose your tribecolored stone you will go on  this adventure."  White. So then it looks like me and Steve are going. Tree mail today basically said two people from the tribe are  going to go to redemption island. Steve and I were the ones who ended up to be the ones to go to  the duel. <br/>Good-bye, guys. <br/>Remember everything you see. <br/>At redemption island I'm not exactly sure what to expect,  but I'm glad that Russell and Stephanie and chris didn't have the opportunity  to go so they don't have an idea of what's there. <br/>On three. <br/>Turn them over, all right. <br/>One, two, three. <br/>Hey, guys! <br/>Hey! <br/>We picked marbles and Ashley and I get to go and watch the  duel between fran and Matt so I'm pretty excited. It's pRobably more about seeing Matt because we're really close  and I think if he realizes I wasn't the one that voted him out he could come  back and be an asset for me to have. <br/>Congratulations. <br/>Have fun. <br/>We had to send two people to what we think is redemption  island. We've got Andrea and Ashley both going over there. What I don't want is Andrea getting smart and talking to Matt,  her island boyfriend. I just don't want her getting any ideas. <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the competitors for today's duel. Francesca and Matt, voted out at the last tribal council. Welcome to redemption island arena. This is where all the duels will take place. Each tribe selected two tribe members to be a witness to your  duel today. Steve and dave, and Ashley and Andrea. Matt, Francesca, both of you voted out by your tribe members for  whatever reason. They didn't want you around anymore. This is the first step in your journey to get even. <br/>I didn't vote for either of them. <br/>Jeff: Matt, what's going through your head right now? <br/>It's do-or-die time so, like, I'm ready to go. It's going to be the greatest underdog story if I get blindsided  by my tribe with none of my stuff except for what I have on and come back all  the way and make it to the end. <br/>Jeff: Francesca, even though you guys were tribemates at  the beginning, are you adversaries now? <br/>I wish Matt very well in his life, but I definitely am  here to beat him in this game. <br/>Jeff: All right, let's get to today's duel. For today's duel, you are going to use sticks and rope to make a  long pole. You'll use that pole to retrieve three keys. Those three keys open three locks. First person through their door stays alive in this game. Loser is out. Their shot at the million dollars, done. It's one shot. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: Take your spots. We'll get started. This is it. Do-or-die time. Survivors ready? Go. It's a good old-fashioned "Survivor" challenge--  sticks and ropes and locks. Winner of this challenge stays alive, continues their quest for  a million-dollar prize. Losers will leave the arena for good, out of the game. Francesca going to give it a go with her stick. She put that together quickly. Will it be strong enough to retrieve that first key? It looks like it. Steady. Nice job. Francesca retrieves that first key. Matt gives it a shot, and his stick falls apart right away. Francesca giving her stick a little once-over. She's going to go back now and try for a second key. She's very close. Can she get it off the peg? Yes. Now can she get it back? Doing a great job. Francesca has her second key, one key left. <br/>Get it, get it. <br/>Jeff: Matt is going to have to pick it up now, start  taking some chances. He's on it. Oh, that stick is not going to stay together. Francesca going for that third key. This could be it for Francesca. That key is a little further out, though. Can she reach it? She's there. Oh! Stick breaks. Matt giving it another go. Matt has the key hooked. He has it off the peg. Matt has his first key back. Matt now going for the second key. That stick looks like it's working now. Gotta get it off that peg. Matt going for that second key, and he has it. Can he get it through the gate? Yes. Matt has his second key. Francesca going for that third key. Matt now going for his third key. Both Matt and Francesca have one key left. You want to stay alive, you need to get it going right now. Is the pole long enough? He's on the key, just short, using every part of his body, still  short, an inch, half an inch short, maybe. Francesca has the key. Matt just misses grabbing the key. Francesca-- oh! Just missed hooking it. Matt is long enough. Is it strong enough? Matt has the third key. He's got to get it through the gate. He's holding on. Matt has all three keys! He can start opening the locks. Francesca needs to make a move quickly. Matt has the first lock open. Matt has the second lock open. This is it for Francesca. Matt has the third lock open. Matt stays alive! <br/>Good job. <br/>Good job, buddy. Give 'em hell. <br/>Jeff: Matt, congratulations. You seized the moment. You are still alive in this game. Francesca, your shot at redemption and the milliondollar prize  is over. You're out of the game. You can toss your buff in the fire on your way out. <br/>Bye, honey. <br/>Love you, franny. <br/>Jeff: Matt, you can head back to redemption island, await  your next opponent. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: why are you laughing? <br/>Because it's not even close to the camp we had back at  ometepe, and being by yourself it's definitely hard, but I mean, gotta seize  the moment. <br/>Jeff: It's on you. Get back to redemption. Make it happen. <br/>Will do. <br/>Jeff: Guys, you can head back to camp. As always, whatever you witnessed here, when you go back to  camp, up to you what you share. Head on out. <br/>Going to redemption island was an eye opener. There might be an opportunity here. I'm thinking there might be some curveball for Russell to tell  them that Francesca won the challenge and sent Matt home. <br/>They're back! <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, they made it. <br/>Yeah, all right! <br/>It's good to be back! <br/>Welcome back. <br/>How's Matt? <br/>He's good. <br/>He's pissed. You can tell. <br/>Yeah. <br/>What did he say? <br/>We didn't get to talk to him. He kept looking up at us and saying he wants to come back and  get his revenge. <br/>Redemption island is real. I mean, there's a chance Matt could run the gamut over there and  come back into this game. Andrea will go back to Matt before she'll stay with me. I know that. So I've got my work cut out for me with Andrea. I like you, Andrea, and I think you're a good-hearted kid, you  know. I'm sorry what happened, you know. I am. And, like, if I could have thought of any other way, then I  would have. But it wasn't just me. <br/>I understand. <br/>There were four people that were involved in it. Four people agreed to it. Four people talked about it. Nobody wanted to do it. <br/>No, but I don't know where I stand now. <br/>I'm telling you, you're still in the-- like, I know, it's  crazy. <br/>So Phillip and christine are going before me? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I talked to Rob, and he assured me that I'm still part of  their five, even though I have a feeling I'm pRobably in a really sticky  position. So right now, strategically it's smart to stay with them and  make sure they don't think I'm scheming, but I just don't believe him. I need in some way to mix things up because, like, deep down,  I'm like still really pissed about what they did. They, like, took my good friend away. <br/>The two blondes. They were sitting up with us in a gladiator stadium. <br/>Who won? <br/>The black chick pulled it off and the blond kid he went  home. We came back from redemption island and we told Russell that Matt  was sent home. <br/>First out, surfer guy. <br/>So whenever we vote Russell out, he'll get over there and  see Matt, who could be a-- quite a challenge for him and hopefully we'll  never see Russell again. <br/>Actually, the black girl went home. <br/>The black girl went home? <br/>The blond dude is there. I just wanted him to be shocked. I just want him to be shocked when he gets there and he's  wrestling the blond dude. <br/>That's awesome. <br/>I know it is 6-3. So right now, the most important thing for me is finding the  idol. If I find the idol, Russell gets another blindside. "Where something is alive next to something that's  not." that's what it's talking about. At the last immunity challenge I got the clue for the idol, but  it's so vague. "Something that's alive," the beach is definitely  alive. Everything out here is alive, the trees, the running water. Where is the idol? The clue said it was by something alive next to something not. My mind is running 100 miles per hour. <br/>Russell and them are still looking for the idol just as  hard as they can look but he ain't going to get it now. 'cause I've got it. And I'm not saying nothing about it, so this is not Russell's  game no more. It's my game. <br/>I just don't think it's here. <br/>The great thing with Russell is that he has a great resume  with immunity idols that he's found on his own. <br/>We're going to have to put it all in your purse. <br/>Yeah. So we are going to fake that we have the idol. And I am hoping that people believe I'm protecting the immunity  idol. But right now, it is just a blank check with no money in the  bank account. [ laughs]  She's keeping a tight hold of that bag, isn't she? <br/>You know it. <br/>All buttoned up. Don't burn that bag, darling. There's gold in there. You want me to hold it for you for a while? I didn't know if your legs were getting tired. <br/>I'm good. <br/>All right. <br/>I like to watch the two girls with that bag. I want to. I mean, watch them. Watch them. <br/>We knew that Russell and his little harem have got the  first immunity clue. Stephanie's carrying the bag around acting like she has the idol  in there. <br/>When Russell orders it, they do it. <br/>I know. I don't know how you do it, brother. Russell is always plotting and scheming. You just don't want the guy around. You know he's going to do everything he can to backstab you. We just have to make sure we stay on our toes until that cancer  is cut out. <br/>You should just lay down like that. <br/>That's what I was doing. <br/>This one doesn't look bad. It's clearing up. <br/>Yeah, that one is clearing up. <br/>Russell has got some funk going on with his armpitts. He shaved them up and now he's got a puss-filled rash all over  the place. I mean, it's disgusting. <br/>It feels like it's getting worse. <br/>He sits in the tent with his concubines and does nothing. He's like a black hole, you know, sucking in energy and light,  everything. <br/>I really think-- my feeling is get rid of Russell sooner  than later. <br/>Oh, yeah. The sooner the better. <br/>He'd be no good-- he'd be no good-- he'd be a thorn in our  side to keep around until the merge. <br/>I agree. <br/>He ain't doing a thing. <br/>He's not lifting any logs. <br/>He ain't carrying no wood, not catching anything to eat. <br/>You know, everybody always thinks you don't want to throw  a challenge. There hasn't been a lot of success throwing challenges because  all of a sudden you're down numbers but he's not a number. <br/>No. <br/>There really is nothing bigger at this point than to get  rid of Russell. He's an irritant. You cannot have this guy lay around and potentially bite any one  of us. <br/>Hey, so let me throw this out here to you. If we had a challenge or something would it make sense to throw  it and just get rid of Russell before he even finds the second clue or third  clue. <br/>I don't want to throw things, but he's looking for an  idol. He's broken right now. He's got rashes everywhere. He hurts like hell. This is the time when you lay the final blow. <br/>Only thing with throwing one, you guys, is that they're  not going to be getting rid of one more person and they might start getting a  roll going and it could reverse on us. They're thinking about throwing our next challenge. I'm just torn. I'm torn about that. Because I like to compete, and I can deal with Russell. <br/>We'll decide when we get there. One thumbs up means we're throwing it. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>We are. <br/>Jeff: All right, zapatera, once again I will take it back. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, three members of each tribe will be strapped  to a large wheel. Three other members will work together to spin the wheel. As the wheel turns, you will go underwater, grab a mouthful of  water, come back to the top, and spit the water out into a tube. Once the tube fills, a ball will roll down to a slide puzzle  where one tribe member must solve the puzzle. First tribe to get their ball through the completed slide puzzle  wins immunity and is safe from tribal council. In addition, you are playing for reward. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: A lot of comfort items here. You have a couple of chairs. Pillows, tarp, three blankets, and a lantern. Losers go to tribal council where the third person will be voted  out of this game and sent to redemption island. Zapatera, you have two extra tribe members-- sitting two people  out. <br/>There's definitely a big tradeoff there between keeping Russell  around and getting a tarp but the plan as it stands right now is to throw the  challenge. Hopefully the end result is worth it. <br/>Jeff: All right, who's it going to be, zapatera? <br/>Ralph and serita. <br/>Jeff: Serita and Ralph, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize and we'll  get started. <br/>I'm going to do the puzzle part. You guys work the wheel. <br/>Julie. <br/>She's gonna just be missing the bucket. Miss the bucket. Miss the bucket. If you want to throw it. <br/>Right now the plan is to throw the challenge. It's a decision I'm not really feeling right with. <br/>Jeff: here we go. For immunity and reward, survivors ready? Go! Natalie with a lot of water. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Jeff: Stephanie with a good spit of water. Both tribes doing very well. Takes a lot of guts to be the people on the wheel being thrown  underwater every few seconds to take in a mouthful of water and then spit it  into a tube. <br/>Come on. <br/>Jeff: Kristina with a good job. Krista does a nice job. Julie misses. Ometepe has this nailed. Zapatera not so much. <br/>Come on! <br/>Jeff: Steve seems to be wearing out. <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>Jeff: Ometepe releases their ball. Rob can now start working on the puzzle. <br/>Come on, come on, come on. <br/>Jeff: Big head start for Rob. <br/>Let's go! Let's go! <br/>Let's go, Rob! <br/>Jeff: zapatera really slowing down. David would like to have a shot at this puzzle. <br/>Good job, Rob! <br/>Jeff: Rob working quickly on the slide puzzle. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Come on, stef! There you go. <br/>Jeff: zapatera releases their ball. David can start working on the puzzle. <br/>Come on, dave. <br/>Jeff: It is a showdown between the puzzle makers. David and Rob. Zapatera won in this showdown at the very first challenge. Rob looking for a little redemption, would like to bring home  immunity for ometepe. Zapatera has yet to go to tribal council. <br/>Come on, dave, you can do this. <br/>Jeff: Rob making some progress. <br/>Come on, dave. <br/>Jeff: Dave barely working. <br/>Come on, dave. <br/>You're looking good, Rob, keep it up. <br/>Jeff: Rob getting closer to the finish. <br/>Come on Rob! <br/>Come on David! Come on, you're the man! <br/>Yeah, Rob! <br/>There you go, Rob. <br/>Jeff: Rob thinks he has it. <br/>Go, Rob! <br/>Jeff: Rob has it. He's got the ball in the channel. It's as easy as that. Ometepe wins their first challenge! Reward and immunity. <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>All right! <br/>Jeff: Ometepe, congratulations. Rob, first win for this tribe. How does it feel? <br/>Overdue. <br/>Jeff: Grab your reward. Head back to camp. Enjoy the night off. All right, zapatera, new experience tonight. Tribal council where you will vote your first person out of the  tribe. That person will go to redemption and will have to compete in a  duel to stay alive. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you tonight at tribal. <br/>If I didn't know any better, I would think they threw the  challenge. Every single one of them let the challenge go. I'm dealing with a bunch of bitches. <br/>We won today's immunity and reward challenge, and  normally, that would put me through the roof happy. But now we have these little things called hidden immunity  idols. Now I know enough that there's pRobably a clue to that hidden  immunity idol somewhere hidden within our reward, and it was almost as if  there was no time to celebrate because everybody's looking for where the clue  could be. The game is always on. In the past, I ignored the hidden immunity idol. Well, that didn't turn out too good for me. So this time around I decided maybe I can learn something, too. So I'm starting to look for them, and I'm starting to be  diligent about it. I went through everything. And it was nowhere. I look over and I see Phillip's fat ass bending the chair about  to break it. How does it feel? <br/>It feels good. <br/>Why is it lopsided? <br/>It's pRobably missing a screw and I'm pRobably not on even  ground. <br/>Hold on. Yeah, don't because you're gonna break it. <br/>Think so? <br/>Sit over here. Get a screw. <br/>I looked down and the hidden immunity idol clue is right  underneath his ass. It's sitting, sewn inside the fabric of the chair. I gotta fix this. I think I have a screw in the toolbox. Sweet. "Rocks, trees, logs, and sand. Foraging, climbing or maybe digging you'll be. The idol is near one of the above. You'll have to explore them all to see." the clue basically  could have read "The hidden immunity idol is somewhere." I mean, it  could be anywhere. I'm happy that I found the clue because I know now that nobody  else found the clue. I'm going down for a little crab attack. But I don't plan on telling anybody about the clue because I  want the idol for me. <br/>Let's get the fire going. <br/>I'll get it. I'll get it. Well, it was a thrown challenge. Because we do gotta get Russell out as quick as possible. Russell thinks he runs the show, and he don't. He's not my boss and he's not boss of me. <br/>Do we have a plan? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Sticking to that? <br/>Sticking to the plan. We're going to go 3-3. <br/>The plan tonight is to give three votes to Russell and  three votes to Stephanie in the absolutely remote, rare event that Russell  did find an idol. So if everything goes as planned tonight, Russell will go home. <br/>It's stupid to throw challenges when you are only two up. I can see if you're five up or something, four up, maybe. <br/>Yeah. <br/>But two up? When the game just started? What do they want to go even at the merge? I think they threw the challenge. It makes me sick to my stomach because you have to win right  now. You can't give Boston Rob momentum. Not in this game. If they split the votes, it will be a two-way tie. One will be safe, they would revote and I would go home. I have to convince somebody to flip. One person. <br/>Tonight at tribal council, we were thinking the votes  would be split 3-3-3 because they would want to flush out the idol and get  rid of one of us. So all it would take is for one of their six to flip on them and  vote with us, so that we would get the majority of the votes. <br/>Do you think... The old lady will? <br/>Okay. <br/>Would it be weird if I asked you where do you think  exactly you stand with the six people you have? We know that we have our one, two, three. <br/>Right. You guys are strong. <br/>You know. <br/>I don't know. <br/>Well, we have stuff up our sleeves. <br/>Yeah. <br/>But to tell you the truth, we're looking for the fourth  person. <br/>See, and Russell knows how to get to the end. <br/>And we have the idol. <br/>Right on. <br/>We should sit down. I'm getting...  You're getting lightheaded. And to be honest I like my chances with somebody who has been  there before a couple times before. <br/>Exactly. <br/>If I do become a fourth...  You need to remember, he will take us to the top. And then after that...  It makes sense. I mean, it makes sense. <br/>It makes perfect sense. <br/>This is a game turner right here, this vote. So, it's a lot of pressure. I have thought it out both ways. Should I go with Russell? Should I trust him? Because I know how good he is. <br/>She's on our side. <br/>Okay. Now, I'm going to talk to her. <br/>Okay. This is going to be the biggest blindside ever. <br/>If you-- if you do this, if this goes the way it goes, I  got your [ no audio] back. <br/>Okay, I trust you, dude. <br/>Let's do it. Ralph. Let's get rid of Ralph. I'm telling you, you do this with me, I got you. <br/>All right. <br/>If this happens, game on. This will be the biggest move, bigger than any move I've ever  made. This will be a shocker. That's what it's all about right there. "Keep hope alive" baby. This ain't over till it's over. <br/>Jeff: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch and approach the flame. Dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual of tribal council because in this  game, fire represents your life. When your fire's gone, so are you. With a slight exception this season: redemption island. So, Ralph, first time tribal council. <br/>Well, it's good and it's bad. <br/>Jeff: what's good about coming to tribal? <br/>Well, I was told we had two parts in our game. <br/>Jeff: I'm lost. Two parts? <br/>We've got two teams in the same team. <br/>Jeff: You're saying there's a division within the tribe. <br/>Yes, a division. <br/>Jeff: Steve, was it quickly apparent who was jelling with  who? <br/>Yes, it was, Jeff. There are six of us that are pretty rock solid, and then there's  another three led by Russell. <br/>Jeff: Serita, what caused the division within this tribe? <br/>I think it was a lot to do with Russell and his legacy,  and Russell had given this great speech about how he was going to play  differently and that turned out not to be the case so there was a huge  fissure in the tribe. <br/>Jeff: Russell you had to know you were coming in here with  a target? <br/>Jeff, the pRoblem with me coming here everybody perceives  me as that legacy where I would try to lose by burning socks, pouring out  water. I am not playing that game. I came in to win challenges, not to lose challenges. And, you know, from where I stood, it felt to me that a lot of  people gave up in the challenge. <br/>Jeff: Today? <br/>It felt that they threw the challenge. <br/>Jeff: Mike, big accusation. <br/>Pretty big. You know, today I would say we didn't go 100%. We definitely wanted to win, but if we lost, we got some fat on  this tribe we need to trim off. <br/>Jeff: Julie, hard to consider getting rid of somebody when  you know that it is about numbers, quite often? <br/>Personally, I would like to merge with as many people as  possible. Weak or strong, whether we get along or not, I think we need to  go into the merge with numbers. <br/>Jeff: Stephanie, what do you believe? <br/>Well, I think the majority of the tribe forget that  they're in the game of "Survivor." this is Russell. He's played the game. He would be a huge part of moving forward. He's done it twice. One way or another, there's going to be backstabbing made, so if  you guys want to become best friends right now, that's fine. But your best friend to the left of you, to the right of you, is  going to turn around and stab you in the back because you don't have enough  numbers. <br/>What she doesn't realize is...  I'm still talking, mouth is still moving, thank you. <br/>Feisty! <br/>Having the numbers in the merge is what you need to take  over the other tribe. We were two people above them, guys. So throwing today's challenge is not strategy. It's plain stupidity. That's all. <br/>Jeff: Steve, going into a merge, an incohesive group of  nine is a much bigger advantage than a tight six down at the merge. That's the point Stephanie's making. <br/>It stunk not winning today. <br/>Jeff: So you're saying absolutely not, you guys did not  throw the challenge. <br/>We did not throw the challenge. I worked my tail off, and I think everybody else did, too. <br/>Jeff: So, David, you got your ass kicked by Rob handily  today. It wasn't even close. <br/>Rob beat me. <br/>Really? For me it's weird because someone who does puzzles...  Somebody shouldn't speak for me on that note, actually. I take a little exception to all this. Just because the hands aren't moving doesn't mean the mind isn't  working. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: Serita, is part of what is scary about Russell is  you just don't know what he's going to say or do? <br/>It's just a sickness, almost. It's a huge black cloud over everything we do. He does nothing at camp...  What's that, Stephanie? <br/>I really can't hear her to say Russell doesn't do  anything. He gets firewood. We catch crab. Don't say he doesn't do anything. Wake up, okay? <br/>Jeff: Ralph, you had a huge reaction. <br/>He won't catch the fish but he will eat every piece that  is brought in. <br/>Jeff: I think you said she's not helping at all to do  anything, catch fish, but eat it. <br/>No. <br/>Jeff: we're early in the game and you guys are so divided  you're in trouble come a merge. Big prediction from me, but I think I'm right. So, Russell, what do you do? <br/>You know, I never stop playing this game. <br/>Jeff: You have a new tattoo on your arm, "Keep hope  alive."  That's all I have right now is hope. First time I played I was in trouble. Second time I played, I was in trouble. I know what they think, but it never is what it seems. <br/>Jeff: All right, it is time to vote. Steve, you're up. <br/>I'm voting for you. You are so misguided and so rude. <br/>This is my game, sucker. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Russell. Ralph. Stephanie. Russell. That's two votes Russell. Russell. That's three votes Russell, one vote Ralph, one vote Stephanie. That's two votes Stephanie, three votes Russell, one vote Ralph. Ralph. Two votes Ralph, two votes Stephanie, three votes Russell. We're tied. Three votes Ralph, three votes Russell, two votes Stephanie, one  vote left. Stephanie. We have a three-way tie. Here's what's going to happen. Stephanie, Russell, Ralph, you will not vote. Everybody else will vote, and you can only vote for Ralph, Russell,  or Stephanie. Steve, if you'll grab this. I'll go tally the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote, Ralph. Russell. Russell. Russell. Three votes Russell, one vote Ralph. Third person voted out of "Survivor: redemption  island," Russell. That's four. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>I'll be back and be ready. <br/>I'll be ready. <br/>Jeff: Russell, the tribe has spoken. You will have a chance to get back in this game. Grab your torch, head to redemption island. <br/>Jeff: well, you just voted out one of the most successful  players in the history of "Survivor." the question is: will this  decision come back to haunt you? Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor": phil's on the hot  seat. <br/>He is so annoying. <br/>Jeff: But with the hidden immunity idol in play, anything  can happen. <br/>Somebody within my alliance might flip. <br/>Jeff: And at redemption island, it's time for Russell to  put up or shut up. <br/>This was the real world, I'd be rooting for Matt. But it's not. This is "Survivor."  This is the first time I've ever been voted out. I don't like it at all. I was pissed off. I wanted to bitch-slap every single one of them. <br/>Russell! <br/>Right now this is his house. I'm about to take it from him.
