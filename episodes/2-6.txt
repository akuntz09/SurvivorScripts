<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor: Sparks flew between Kimmi  and Alicia. <br/>Kimmi: Don't wave your finger in my face. <br/>Alicia: I will always wave my finger...  Kimmi: What have I said about the chickens, though,  nothing! <br/>Alicia: I'm tired of and you the [ bleep] chickens! [ bird squawks]  Jeff: Ogakor had their own problems-- they kept losing  challenges. <br/>Amber: I'm so tired of losing. <br/>Jeff: But a pep talk from Colby fired up the troops. <br/>Colby: It is going to take every ounce of strength. It is going to be one hell of a show today. <br/>Jeff: Survivors ready! Go! <br/>Get it. <br/>Where is it? Here it is. <br/>Jeff: After a long losing streak, Ogakor rebounded and  regained the immunity idol. <br/>Tina: We're out. [ screaming happily]  Jeff: So Kucha made the hike to Tribal Council. Next vote, Kimmi. The tribe has spoken. Eleven remain. Who will be voted out tonight? [ thunder crashing] Who will be voted out tonight? [ thunder crashing]  Alicia: Wow, you guys. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God. Did we find the matches? [ thunder crashing, rain pouring]  Rodger: The rain, yes. We got to Tribal Council last night, hadn't been there probably  five minutes, I guess, and then all of a sudden, here comes... the heaviest  rain we've had since we've been here. I mean, it really came down. Put our fire out. So then we had to use one of our matches to light a candle in  our hut. Got the candles going and searched through and found the very  warmest, well, not the warmest, but really the driest clothes that we had. A lot of us had wore our clothes to Tribal Council that we'd  been used to sleeping in. I know I did, for one. That was a mistake. [ thunder crashing]  Elisabeth: Oh, my God! This is crazy. Is that coming in from the outside? <br/>Jeff V.: Yeah, I think it is. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh! <br/>Jeff V.: Oh, my God. It's coming in hard. This is going to suck. <br/>Elisabeth: When it rains here, it means you're cold at  night, you don't sleep. Rain is... I mean, it puts you in such an extreme disadvantage. It's... it takes you a day to recover from rain. I mean, there's a risk of getting sick, you're sleeping in the  cold, wet. There's nothing worse than the rain here. [ thunder crashing] Nothing worse. 'Cause being cold is guaranteed at night. But cold and wet? Stick a fork in me. It stinks. <br/>Jeff V.: Good night, Jim Bob. [ scattered chuckling]  ALICIA [ chuckles]: Shut up. "Jim Bob." [ thunder crashing, rain pouring ]  Jeff V.: I love this place. You gotta love it. [ thunder echoing]  Michael: It's amazing how you can live off the land, eight  city people can come out here and live off the land. It's amazing. Not only food wise, but shelter wise and safety wise, and, um,  heat wise. And starting a fire this morning with wet wood. It's just amazing to me. It's a whole... my outlook on life has changed 180 degrees. And I'm this kind of guy. I'm this kind... you know, this should be nothing for me. But, uh, I am a changed man already, after 16 days. Very changed. And if I last another 16 days, who knows what's going to happen  to me. <br/>Alicia: Today is day 16. We are thinking ahead now to, uh, the merger. We have four more days until that happens. <br/>Jeff V.: We started with 16 people. Six people are voted out of the outback. Then when it gets to ten people, everybody comes together into  one tribe and the game, all of a sudden, becomes every man for himself. <br/>Nick: There's one more immunity challenge left, we have  six and they have five, and, uh, that's a huge advantage because the pressure  is on them to win the next challenge, and, uh, we're really hoping to go into  the merger six to four, and that way we could basically pick them off one by  one. <br/>Jeff V.: We are a very cocky group. It's fun to beat them and make fun of it. It's fun to have them talk about how hungry they are, and us go  in there and win all their food. That's fun! <br/>Amber: Oh, my God, I'm so hungry. <br/>Jerri: There's enough in here for...  Amber: I'd say three tortillas. <br/>Jerri: Yeah, I could get three tortillas out of that, but  I'd say we go two. <br/>Amber: Oh, my God. [ Jerri laughs softly] And to think the other tribe is eating  eggs. <br/>Jerri: Bastards. And soup, and spices. <br/>Amber: And chicken, and pig. <br/>Jerri: I just, at some point, have to get my hands on some  chocolate. I fear I might go psycho. And I'm not kidding. I had a discussion with Colby regarding chocolate and how  chocolate releases the same endorphins that sex does, and since none of us  are having sex, that that's probably why we keep reverting to the chocolate  discussions. I'm going to bathe myself in chocolate. <br/>Amber: I can't get over... I just want to bite into one of  those so bad, it's unbelievable. Like a peppermint patty. <br/>Jerri: Right now, I can actually, in my wildest fantasy,  picture pouring hot chocolate all over... some hot dude's bod and having sex  while licking it off at the same time. That's like my ultimate fantasy right now. <br/>Amber: It's like when you pull apart the chocolate... [  Jerri squeals in frustration] [ Amber laughs softly]  Colby: When you're asleep at night in the tent, and you  hear moaning and groaning about Hershey Kisses, you know what's really going  on though. It ain't about the chocolate. <br/>Jerri: Vanilla ice cream...  Amber: Oh, my God. <br/>Jerri: ...with hot fudge trickled all over the top! <br/>Amber: Yes! [ both scream happily]  Colby: She's using her thoughts of chocolate to substitute  for her thoughts of sex. It's just making for a very uncomfortable camping trip. <br/>Amber: Peppermint Pattie! <br/>Jerri: I think Colby's afraid of me. Because this fantasy I have about chocolate and sex definitely  involves him. Oh, God, I can't take. I can't take it anymore! <br/>Colby: I may be a lot of things, but I ain't no Hershey  bar. [ laughing]  Jerri: Snickers! <br/>Amber: Kit Kat, Milky Way, M&amp;Ms! Reese's Cup! A meatball sub! <br/>Jerri: Oh, yeah! I love those! <br/>Colby: This is ridiculous man. They're driving me nuts. [ girls yelling, bongo playing] Bring on... get rid of these  goons, and let's get something going. This is crazy. [ Jerri laughing]  Amber: Oh, my God! <br/>Colby: Hey, girls, guess what's for dinner? [ Jerri laughs]  BOTH: Rice. <br/>Colby: We're having white rice. [ both moan] [ bongo plays] [ chicken clucks softly]  Elisabeth: Chicken feed, huh? <br/>Rodger: I really don't think there's a thing in there that  will hurt you. <br/>Elisabeth: I think it would probably be better cooked, we  know it's clean... after I eat a handful. I just wonder if it's been, like, stepped on and stuff by other  chickens, and...  Rodger: Well, if it's cooked...  Alicia: That's good, actually. <br/>Elisabeth: Actually, not bad. [ Michael speaks indistinctly]  Alicia: Chicken feed. We bring back the chicken, the rooster, the chicken feed, and of  course, in true Kucha style, we're trying to figure out how we can utilize  every single little thing we brought back. Elisabeth and I said, "Can we eat that?" Because it  just looks like nuts and grains and corn and wheat, and, you know, it just  looks so good to us for some reason. And he told us, you know, he's like, "Yeah, it's good for  you."  Michael: Ow, ow, ow, ow. Yeow. You guys, it's popping. You guys should see this stuff. It's popping like popcorn. You guys, come here quick. It is popcorn! It's popcorn! It's cracking, it's popping. <br/>Alicia: Can you believe that? It is popcorn. It's popcorn. There's popcorn in this pan. This camp just gets better and better every minute. <br/>Michael: Ow! Wow! Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. <br/>Jeff V.: I don't know about this chicken pop feed,  whatever. I just... I don't know. It's good, and I hated it, the whole thought of eating chicken  feed just made me sick. But the more I eat it, the better it gets. <br/>Alicia: Do you love it? <br/>Jeff V.: Oh, my God. <br/>Alicia: That just, we-- forget it. We are now addicted. It's so good. <br/>Michael: Oh, my gosh. <br/>Alicia: And we have, like, chicken popcorn. We wake up in the morning, we make it. After we eat breakfast, in the afternoon, we make it. [ thunder crashing] At night, we make it. And we're going to find out, like, somewhere down the road that,  like, something was in it, and we're going to have like eight nipples and  laying eggs, and I don't know, but until that happens, I'm going to keep  eating it because it's so good. It's so good. <br/>Michael: Let's kill those chickens so they don't eat any  more feed. [ Michael laughing] [ chicken clucking]  Keith: Jerri and Amber went to pick some tomatoes. Jerri has, um, decided she wants to do fried green tomatoes, but  they're cherry tomato. <br/>Jerri: But I can tantalize our taste buds with fried green  tomatoes this evening. <br/>Amber: Getting creative. <br/>Jerri: Have to. <br/>Colby: Thank you. <br/>Jerri: They aren't quite as ripe, but...  Keith: You don't do fried green tomatoes with cherry  tomatoes. My thought was maybe leave them on the vine just another couple  days, they'll be nice and bright red and real juicy and good to eat. Another day, those would have been perfect. But, uh, doesn't look like that's going to happen. <br/>Jerri: Well, it just would help if you weren't quite so  pessimistic about ideas that others have other than your own. <br/>Keith: I wasn't pessimistic. I'm not picking on you about you tomatoes. <br/>Jerri: You already did on the way here. You said, "I don't think that can be done."  Keith: That's good, well, then this will be good. We have fried green tomatoes. <br/>Colby: Keith and Jerri, are just... like two alley cats  scratching with each other. They're fighting over fried green tomatoes of all things, and  it's ridiculous that the rest of us have to sit through all this. <br/>Jerri: I don't... yeah, I think it's done yet, Keith. It looks totally soupy. It needs to sit there till it's dry. It's going to be soupy. <br/>Colby: Keith is a chef, man. You don't have to insult the guy by telling him he doesn't know  what he's talking about. I think it's disrespectful and rude. And that's what Jerri loves to do, because she knows it's going  to ruffle his feathers. <br/>Jerri: You got to let the rice sit. <br/>Keith: You can't. ...sticking to the bottom and burning. <br/>Colby: It's all breaking up, though. <br/>Jerri: It's 'cause he kept stirring it. You've got to leave it in there. <br/>Tina: Stop it! Both of you! Or you're going to time out. I'm not their mother. It's not my position to get in the middle and send them both to  time out. But to be honest, I think one of the problems needs to go. We can't afford for people not to get along. Jerri makes me feel uncomfortable. You know, you're always walking on eggshells around her. And it's just no fun living in that type of situation. <br/>Keith: Another...? <br/>Colby: Oh, yeah! They're kind of like okra. They really are kind of like...  Amber: Did you try one? You didn't like it? <br/>Tina: It has a sour... almost a sour bite to it. <br/>Jerri: It's 'cause they're green. [ Jerri chuckles]  Keith: So the fried green tomatoes sucked. I knew they would. Poor Colby stomached all of them, including mine, told her they  were great. 'Cause Colby is a gentleman. But I do not like them. <br/>Amber: What will the reward be today? <br/>Jerri: I don't know. I'm feeling good about it today, though. "The next challenge you face is no walk in the park. Now we'll find out who's afraid of the dark! To lead the whole tribe there can only be one. The winners will picnic and the losers get none!" A picnic! <br/>Amber: Oh, my God! Like a barbecue! <br/>Jerri: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [ Jerri screams happily] Yeah! Oh, my God! <br/>Keith: This better be good. <br/>Jerri: Oh, my God. <br/>Colby: Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. <br/>Jerri: A picnic! Food! Can you imagine, like, real food! <br/>Amber: Sandwiches. <br/>Jerri: I can't, oh... You know there's going to be  dessert. Tina! <br/>Tina: ...and there's food involved. <br/>Jerri: Yes, there is. <br/>Amber: A huge at of food! <br/>Jerri: "The winners will picnic and the losers get  none!"  Amber: Picnic. A picnic. <br/>Jerri: Picnic. <br/>Tina: And I am not afraid of the dark, sister. [ whooping]  Jeff V.: I have really good, uh, vision. <br/>Elisabeth: If it's in the water, we're afraid of the dark. <br/>Alicia: We don't want to be in the dark. We're not eat leading... we're not leading the tribe. <br/>Elisabeth: I'll follow. <br/>Alicia: Me, too. <br/>Michael: "The winners will..."  Jeff V.: Picnic. <br/>Alicia: Picnic, honey. <br/>Nick: We just got you're tree mail for tonight's reward  challenge. It sounds like we're going to be doing something at night,  almost definitely, um, and it says "to lead the whole tribe there can  only be one." Um, so it sounds like one person will be leading the tribe  through the dark. You're good, you're good, you're good. Okay, toward my voice, toward my voice, toward my voice. <br/>Alicia: We don't want the opposition to win the picnic,  because we have a big immunity challenge tomorrow and, uh, if they win, it  could... it could give them that little boost, uh, and we don't want them to  have that. <br/>Nick: Towards my voice, towards my voice. <br/>Jerri: Definitely. <br/>Amber: Oh, my God, a picnic is so much better...  Jerri: There's no mess. No plucking, no cutting. <br/>Amber: It's already made for us. <br/>Jerri: Oh, a bottle of chardonnay. A little cheese and crackers. <br/>Nick: Uphill a little bit. Right, right. To your right a little bit. Right, straight, straight. <br/>Jerri: Put your hands above your heads, interlacing your  fingers, pointing to the sky. If Kucha wins this is reward, it would suck! [ laughs] They don't deserve it. They've been eating like kings over there, and I think it would  be really nice of them if they threw this one for us. <br/>Amber: Picnic, picnic, picnic, picnic...  Jerri: Ah... picnic! <br/>Colby: Dinner. It's all about the grub. <br/>Jerri: That's right. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. How goes it? <br/>Alicia: Good. <br/>Jeff: Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Jerri: Yeah! <br/>Amber: Yes, yes. <br/>Jeff: Give you a little sample. One Doritos chip for each tribe. <br/>Amber: Oh! Doritos! <br/>Tina: Oh, my gosh. A Doritos! <br/>Amber: You can have first bite. <br/>Alicia: Oh, my God. Take a bite. <br/>Amber: Oh, my God! Wow! <br/>Jeff: One chip and one sip. [ Jerri squeals happily]  Amber: Oh, my God! Something besides water. <br/>Jerri: Do the Dew. <br/>Jeff: A little Mountain Dew. <br/>Jerri: Do the Dew, baby! <br/>Elisabeth: Wow. <br/>Amber: Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: That will get you guys going. <br/>Alicia: You the man. <br/>Jerri: Unbelievable! <br/>Amber: Oh, my God. It's so good. <br/>Jeff: Certainly you guys have figured out to survive out  here you have to be able to trust each other, to a certain degree anyway. Each tribe will select one set of eyes. That will be your tribe's leader. The rest of the tribe will be blindfolded. And it's your leader's communication skills that are going to be  the name of this game. Sitting atop two elevated perches and using only your voices,  the two chosen leaders-- Jerri for Ogakor, Nick for Kucha-- you're going to  navigate your blind tribes through a series of tasks. The first tribe to complete all the tasks wins the reward. Here's how the course works: First task involves two logs and a  sawhorse. You need to get the logs into the sawhorse. Your next task: Get to this table, take this trap, switch it for  the other trap that's in the water. When you've completed that, you'll see a series of buckets. Each member needs to get a bucket, go to the water tower, fill  their bucket with water. Once it's full, guide them to the wine barrel, have them dump  their water into the wine barrel. When the wine barrel overflows, you move to the final task. That is getting the picnic basket to the finish table. First tribe to get their basket on the table wins the reward. Survivors ready! Go! <br/>Nick: Okay, stay there. Stay there. Hold hands and walk straight. Walk straight. Stop, stop, stop. Bend down, bend down... There's two logs. No, Mike, stay. Mike, back up. There's a log, Jeff, you've got a...  Jerri: Tina, keep going straight. Keep going straight. Stop! Stop! Amber, keep to your left. Towards me, towards me. Keith and Amber, come forward. The other way. <br/>Nick: Walk straight, Alicia. There you go. No, no, okay, stop. <br/>Jerri: There's a log by your leg, Colby, you're going to  pick it up, pick it up. There's a sawhorse to your left, a sawhorse to your left. You're going to put it on the sawhorse at both ends. Amber, Keith, Amber, Keith, go back, go back. <br/>Nick: There you go, there you go, there you go. You got one. Okay, Elisabeth stay there, there you go. There you go. There, stop, drop it, drop it. <br/>Jerri: Colby, go the other side of the sawhorse, go the  other side. Climb over it if you have to. There's another log. You're going to do the same exact thing. <br/>Nick: Okay, walk forward, walk forward, walk forward. There you go, there you go... Walk, two more steps. Stop, stop, stop. There's a trap, just like our fish trap. Grab that, grab that, okay. <br/>Jerri: There's a yabby trap on the table. <br/>Colby: A what? <br/>Jerri: A yabby trap. Grab it, shuffle side step to your right. You're going to go in the water, in the water, in the water is  another yabby trap. Colby, back step. <br/>Nick: One step more, one step more, Mike and Elisabeth. <br/>Jerri: It's hooked around the flag. Go back. Colby, it's hooked around the flag. Lift it up then around. No, no, no, the other way, the other way. No, Colby, down. [ Colby yells] Colby, underneath, underneath the rope,  underneath the rope, underneath it. Okay. Now shuffle, side step, side step, Tina, to your right. You're going to go in the water. <br/>Nick: Right in front of you is the table. Right in front of you is the table. Mike, drop the trap on the table. There you go, there you go. Mike, Elisabeth, side step left. Side step left, side step left. Side step left, side step left. Stop, stop, stop. Forward, Jeff, three steps forward. Three steps forward. Stop, stop, stop. Take a bucket right in front of you. <br/>Jerri: Up on land, up on land. Go backwards, go backwards. Yabby trap on the table. On the table. Set it down. Come forward, come forward. Colby stop, reach down. Um, there's going to be buckets, there are buckets in front of  you. Right to your left. Yeah, grab that bucket. Tina, there's another bucket. <br/>Nick: Everybody, side step left. <br/>Whose left? [ Nick and Jerri shouting]  Jerri: Okay, you guys, now, both of you move forward. Go forward. Go, go. You can just keep going. Keep going back, backwards, backwards. There's a silo back there. There's a hook that you're going to pull and fill your buckets  with water. Face to your left then go. There's a straight open shot. Keith, go to your right. Keith, go to your right. <br/>Colby: Jerri! <br/>Jerri: Move to the right of the silo. There you go. Right above your head, there is a thing you're going to pull. Right... no! Keith and Amber, backwards, backwards, backwards. <br/>Colby: Jerri! <br/>Jerri: Keep going backwards. Pull it, Colby, pull it. Pull it, you'll feel water. Fill up your bucket. <br/>Nick: Side step, side step, side step. <br/>Jerri: Amber, Keith, go straight, go straight! You're going to feel Colby. There's water-- fill up your buckets. Fill up your buckets. <br/>Nick: Jeff, to your left. Straight, your hands straight in the air. There you go, Jeff, grab it. Now fill the bucket. Fill the bucket. Fill the bucket. Fill the bucket. <br/>Jerri: Colby, take your full bucket, walk towards my  voice. Keep heading straight, straight, straight. You got it, you got it. There's a thing. Dump your thing in... dump your water in there. <br/>Nick: Stop! <br/>Jerri: Dump it in, dump it in. <br/>Nick: Follow my voice. Follow my voice. <br/>Jerri: Now go backwards. Go back to the waterfall, go. Tina, come towards my voice. <br/>Nick: Okay, bend down with your right hand. There's a big bucket. A big tub. Pour your bucket. Pour your bucket in there. There you go, there you go. Okay, you guys need to do the same thing you just did, okay? <br/>Jerri: Stop, stop. Keep going forward. Now in front of you is a wheelbarrow. Dump it in, dump it in, dump it in! Amber, Keith, move forward, move forward! Okay. Keep moving... stop, stop, stop. <br/>Nick: Mike, Elisabeth, follow my voice. Step forward, step forward. Mike, to your right, Mike to your right. Okay, okay, Mike, Mike, stop, Mike, stop. Okay, bend down. You'll feel a big barrel, big barrel to your right. Fill it up. <br/>Jerri: Grab Amber, grab Amber! Fill the wheelbarrow! Fill the wheelbarrow! We got enough? Good enough? <br/>Jeff: You're good. [ Jerri screams happily] Okay, Keith, Amber, towards me, towards  me, now. Straight, straight. Stop, Amber, stop. Amber, stop. <br/>Nick: Jeff, Alicia, stop, stop, Jeff, stop. Pour it... There you go. Pour, Alicia, pour. <br/>Jerri: ...picnic basket, pick it up! Pick it up! <br/>Jeff: You're good. <br/>Nick: Okay, okay, drop the buckets. Drop the buckets. Come my voice, quick, quick, quick, quick. <br/>Jerri: Right, right, no, no, behind you... Go, go, go! Amber, stop. Stop moving. No, stop. Rotate to your right, rotate to your right. All right, stop. Forward, forward, forward, forward. Tina... Amber, behind you! Amber, behind you! <br/>Jeff: Kucha! [ cheering]  Jeff V.: Awesome! Awesome! [ cheering]  Elisabeth: Oh, my God, you guys! [ cheering]  Rodger: Y'all have no idea how close that was. <br/>Alicia: Yes! [ whooping, laughing]  Jerri: Thank you, thank you. I needed that. [ birds twittering] I needed that. [ birds twittering] [ Keith sighs]  Tina: Everybody here knows [ Keith sighs]  Tina: Everybody here knows the importance of winning  today. Everybody. It is a have-to-win day. But that's pressure. <br/>Amber: If we lose the challenge today, that means we will  be down four to six. The other tribe will probably just pick us off one by one. <br/>Colby: If we don't pull this thing off today, I don't  think it's over at all. It seems to be the attitude of everyone to just lay down and die  if we don't pull this thing off. I'm certainly not going to just sit around and wait to be picked  off by Kucha once we merge. That's not happening with this kid. <br/>Jerri: There's a weird tension in the camp right now. Colby wants to just think about nothing but the game, and then  Amber and Tina are braiding each other's hair and talking about college days. <br/>Amber: And it's funny because in my sophomore  year...  Jerri: Everybody was kind of chitchatting and being very  lighthearted, and I needed to get more centered and focused. <br/>Keith: It was around my head, it catches the back...  Jerri: So I knew that I needed to get away from camp. <br/>Keith: And go like this and it all like, whoosh, and now  it's dark out, and I'm all tangled in this line and...  Colby: Everyone was kind of going in their different  directions, and I decided just to come upstream, and think about the game. You have to be a lot more selfish when you merge, because at  that point it is all about getting yourself as far as you can go. You can't help but think about what's around the corner. <br/>Jerri: Everyone else in the camp is looking at it as if,  if we lose today, that's it, we're all going to be sitting ducks, or we're  going to get picked off one by one. I see it almost as an opportunity to, uh, finagle my way into  the other tribe a bit and mix things up, and freak some people out. If they're going to pick us off one by one, I'm at least going  to cause a big ruckus going down. I'm going to wreak a little havoc. <br/>Michael: Four bites, two havoc. <br/>Michael: Four bites, two fish, that's it. They died in the tin just as fast as they died anywhere else. I don't think I put enough water in it. I put enough to cover their backs, but... I don't know if it got  too hot. It was hot out there. Ooh. <br/>Alicia: It is hot. <br/>Nick: I say we eat Doritos and popcorn as a snack and then  have the fish and rice as a dinner. [ animals chittering] [ animals chittering] [ animals  chittering] [ animals chittering] [ Michael screaming]  Nick: You okay? [ Michael groans in pain]  Alicia: Oh, my God. <br/>Nick: He's burnt. He's burnt pretty bad...  Elisabeth: Here's some water. <br/>Jeff V.: What happened? <br/>Nick: He passed out in the fire. <br/>Jeff V.: Passed out and fell in the fire. <br/>Elisabeth: He passed out in the fire. <br/>Nick: Stay in the water, stay in the water. [ birds squawking]  Elisabeth: Do you want me to come in with you, Mike, and  swim with you? <br/>Jeff V.: You passed out? <br/>Michael: I-I was blowing on the fire and the smoke went  right in my face, and I inhaled it, and I passed out. [ Michael groans] Look at these things. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh... Keep your hands in the water. <br/>Rodger: Oh, Mike. Oh, my God. <br/>Michael: I can't decide whether I should keep trying to  bend them or not. <br/>Alicia: No, don't, don't, don't. <br/>Elisabeth: No, no, Mike, Mike...  Rodger: Hang on. Now don't... don't get out in the deep in case you pass out. <br/>Elisabeth: Yeah, I'm just nervous he's going to go into  shock. [ Michael groans loudly]  Michael: They just keep... it keeps intensifying. <br/>Alicia: I know, I know, Mike. <br/>Rodger: Don't get out in the deep, Mike. <br/>Michael: I'm not, I'm not. I'm on my knees. Oh, they're stiffening up. <br/>Elisabeth: You're good. Okay, Mike, they're coming right now. <br/>Alicia: They're coming right now. Just leave yourself right where you are. <br/>Elisabeth: They're going to put stuff on there, Mike,  you're gonna feel good. They'll wrap it up for you. <br/>Jeff V.: Hang on, Mike. <br/>Elisabeth: You're good, you're good. Stay strong, Mike. Stay strong. [ Michael moaning]  Rodger: His hands are bad. <br/>Elisabeth: Stay strong. <br/>Rodger: Don't go out any deeper than what you are. Stay right there where you're at. [ Michael moaning] [ Michael panting]  Elisabeth: Okay. [ speaking indistinctly] [ Michael groans loudly]  Alicia: The medics are on the way. They're going to look at...  Michael: Ah, I'm okay. [ groans loudly] [ Michael moaning] [ Michael yelling]  Alicia: Just relax. Don't even look at them. Don't even look at them. It's just going to make you feel worse. <br/>Rodger: What, he bent over, working on the fire? <br/>Nick: No, he leaned all the way over and then he started  shaking in the fire and jumped out. I thought he was having a seizure. <br/>Alicia: ...wrap them up, you're going to feel better. <br/>Rodger: I'd keep them in the water till they get here. [ Michael yells in pain] [ indistinct conversations] [ Michael  yells]  Keep 'em in. <br/>Michael: Whoo... that was painful. <br/>Alicia: Watch out, there's a rock...  Michael: You guys just tell me what to do. On the face, on the face. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I'm good, I'm good. <br/>Alicia: He's right there, he's right there. You feel him? [ Michael groans]  Michael: Man, I messed up bad, buddy. <br/>MEDIC 1: What did you do? <br/>Michael: I got a big inhalation of smoke, and I passed out  in the fire. <br/>MEDIC 1: Okay, well...  Michael: You can shoot me, you can... shots, drugs,  pain... If-if I don't... I can take it. I'll take whatever you give me. I'll take the pain without drugs. I'll do whatever you guys say. <br/>Elisabeth: They're going to give you a shot right now,  baby. <br/>Michael: I don't care. If it's good, it's good. You just do it. <br/>MEDIC: It's an anesthetic, okay? <br/>Michael: Okay. Breathe...  MEDIC 1: When you breathe it in and breathe it  out...  Michael: Okay. <br/>...it'll calm you down...  Michael: Through my-through my mouth only? <br/>MEDIC 1: Through your mouth. <br/>MEDIC 2: In and out through the same pipe, Mike. [ Michael muttering]  MEDIC 1: I think we'll try and move him to the shoulder as  soon as we can. [ all talking at once] We're just going to bring you out and put  dressing on to start with. <br/>MEDIC 2: Mike, we're going to do some cold dressings  around them, mate. Just in case... That's the way. Excellent. One for the other arm. <br/>MEDIC 1: Put your other arm out, other arm out. <br/>Rodger: Y'all got him? <br/>Alicia: Yeah, we got him. <br/>MEDIC 2: Okay, buddy. Come on, step... [ speaking indistinctly] Keep walking there,  mate. Keep walking. You all right there, Mike? [ speaking indistinctly] We got a bed up here ready... ready to  go. [ helicopter approaching] One, two, three. Okay, have a lay down there, mate. [ Michael screams] [ medics speaking indistinctly]  MEDIC 1: Here we go. [ medics speaking indistinctly]  MEDIC 1: Here we go. One, two, three, down. <br/>Alicia: Hey, Mike. <br/>MEDIC 1: Said he wants to be transferred to Ogakor. <br/>Rodger: Gonna switch tribes on us, boy? <br/>Michael: I love you, guys! <br/>Elisabeth: Love you! <br/>Alicia: Mike! [ indistinct talking]  Michael: Where's my tribe? <br/>Rodger: Calm down. <br/>Michael: Kucha! <br/>Alicia: Good-bye, baby. [ indistinct talking] Bye, baby. We love you. <br/>Elisabeth: You're good. [ indistinct talking]  Michael: Thank you...  Rodger: I'll keep them in line for you, buddy. Don't you worry about it. [ indistinct talking]  Alicia: Everybody's here. <br/>Michael: I can't see Rodger. <br/>Jeff V.: He's here. <br/>Rodger: Here I am. You thought I'd gone fishing, didn't you? <br/>Michael: I can't see Elisabeth anymore. <br/>Rodger: Here's Elisabeth right here. <br/>Elisabeth: I'm right here. <br/>Michael: I'm looking at some brave, beautiful people who I  have just grown to love so much. <br/>Alicia: We're all good, Mike. Don't even worry about it. <br/>Elisabeth: A-OK. <br/>Michael: I just want to lock eyes with my boys and  girls...  Alicia: We're right here, Mike. <br/>Michael: ...from Kucha. <br/>Elisabeth: We'll see you soon, buddy. <br/>Rodger: Hang in there, buddy. <br/>Michael: I love you, guys. <br/>Alicia: Stay strong. <br/>Michael: You guys do what's right. You guys know what to do. <br/>Rodger: Okay. <br/>Michael: You guys know what to do. You know exactly what to do. Alicia: How many fish do you want? <br/>Jeff V.: See you, Mike. <br/>Rodger: Hang in there, buddy. [ helicopter blades whirring] [ helicopter engine fades] [  helicopter blades whirring] [ helicopter engine fades] [ bird  screeching]  Jerri: Oh, no. [ bird screeching]  Jerri: Oh, no. Oh, my God. <br/>Amber: All right! [ Amber whooping]  Jerri: It's a little disturbing. <br/>Keith: Uh-oh. <br/>Amber: Oh, no. <br/>Jerri: Don't get too excited. <br/>Amber: ...tree mail. <br/>Jerri: No, it's... it's a little strange. "There has been an accident at the Kucha camp, and one of  their members has been evacuated. [ Amber gasps] As a result, there will be no immunity challenge  today... [ Amber gasps] ...and all five of you will continue to the merge. You will receive further instructions soon."  Amber: Oh, my God! <br/>Jerri: Yeah. <br/>Amber: That's awful. <br/>Colby: Oh, my gosh. <br/>Jerri: Yeah. <br/>Keith: Hopefully, they're all right. <br/>Amber: I wonder that this means. Like, I wonder if we...? If... if they...  Jerri: If they have someone hurt, they have five now,  right? <br/>Amber: I hope it's not a snakebite. I hope it's something that heals like... a broken... you know. [ Tina moans]  Jerri: I think a snakebite might be better than a broken  something. "Evacuated." I mean, that's... that's hard core. <br/>Elisabeth: It was... it was so strange to sit there, and  we're all smiling at him, and he's cracking jokes and it was so hard, 'cause  the minute, you know, the minute he was out of sight, it was like decompress  and just, like, oh, gosh, that just happened. And it just really hit hard. Because it makes you... makes you realize that... you're out  here for a period of time with a group of people, and you're doing everything  together, and, you know, you win games, you lose games, you know, you're  sleeping in the same quarters, and one of your teammates goes down, and for  him to ask to see each of us. I mean, I know at one point he was like, "Wait, I can't see  Elisabeth." And I'm... I was, like, behind someone. I'm like, "I'm right here, Mike. You know, here I am." And his eyes were just locked on  ours, locked. <br/>Rodger: We're going to either go win this thing or lose  this thing as a team, I think. I don't think there's... unless somebody jumps boat on us in  mid... in the middle of the stream, which is possible. Uh, we're either going to stick together as a team, and, uh,  possibly Mike's accident, uh, might have brought some of them to the  realization that, you know, maybe there's other things more important than  even the million dollars, you know. <br/>Jeff V.: This merge is going to be intense. Ogakor will be relieved. I think, that they'll... I mean, I think they're good people,  and I think that they're going to feel bad, and sincerely have compassion for  us and for Mike. But they weren't part of that, they didn't experience it. They didn't... hear it. And so that feeling of, oh, my goodness, it's going to have to  be very quickly replaced with relief. That we're merging together, 'cause we had them. We had them. They had to have been scared. They had to have been afraid. There's no way we were losing this challenge today, no way. And, um, we're going to... we're going to kill 'em. We're going to eat 'em up and spit 'em out, and that's the way  Mike would want it to be. It was the last thing he said to us before he left, and it's exactly  what we're going to do. [ fire crackling] exactly what we're going to do. [ fire crackling]  Rodger: God, we give thee thanks today for this beautiful  Lord's day and for all thy many wonderful blessings. We thank thee, dear Lord, for this food, which Mike caught for  us today, and we pray dear Lord that you will be with him as he undergoes  surgery. We pray that you will be with the doctors. Give them the knowledge and the experience and the wisdom to fix  his hands so that they will be once again returned to normal. We just pray that you will be with him, be with his family, and  we just ask that you would bless them and give them strength. And we would ask, dear Lord, that you would also bless the ones  remaining here in this group, and ask that you would be with us and give us  your guidance and also your strength and your support. In your son's holy name we ask it. Amen. <br/>Elisabeth: Amen. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode and hear  what Michael has to say. Next time on Survivor:  Jerri: We're moving! <br/>Jeff: Due to Michael's accident, Kucha and Ogakor will  merge with five members each. <br/>Jeff V.: Damn it. <br/>Jeff: Is it a time of celebration...  Yeah! <br/>Jeff: ...or do tribal loyalties run deep? <br/>Jeff V.: I saw Colby walk over to Keith, and they're,  like, pointing at us and counting fingers, like, "She's going to go  first" and "He's going to go second." We weren't together 15  minutes and it started. <br/>Michael: You don't... you don't want to leave. The longer you're here, the longer you want to stay here. And it's not even about winning as much as... playing. The winning will be anticlimactic. The playing is where it is for me.
