<br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. <br/>We're going to have to earn this. <br/>Jeff: Kama getting your first look at the Lesu tribe. Still intract. Kama getting your first look at the new Manu tribe. Wendy voted out at the last tribal council. <br/>Whoa. <br/>Jeff: Wow. Wardog, did you see that reaction? That was a true celebration. <br/>It was. Definitely the tribal lines are still intact. It's eight Kama and four old Manu. <br/>Jeff: All right. Shall we get to it? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Everybody drop your buffs. We are merged. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Your new buffs, take one and pass them down. <br/>I love the color. <br/>How fun is that. <br/>As soon as Jeff says we're merged, that's like a dream  come true, but I don't know what's going to go on, so I am a little worried. That's what makes Survivor great. You never know what's looming around the corner. <br/>Jeff: Well, over the years certain moments on  "Survivor" have become iconic. Some moments take years to become iconic. Others become iconic the moment they happen. This might be one of them. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Jeff: Come on in. <br/>Wait. What? <br/>I knew it! I knew it! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Are you serious? <br/>There's always a twist. <br/>Oh, my God, they're all coming. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Wow. <br/>They're all back. <br/>It ain't over. <br/>Jeff: This season ever voted. <br/>-out player had a decision to make. They could give up, or they could decide to stay and fight for  another shot to get back in this game. This season every player voted out opted to fight for another  shot. They were taken to another island, the Edge of Extinction. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: The details of what they've been through out there  will be theirs to share as information is key, but I feel compelled to share  that they have had to work every bit as hard as you have since they've been  voted out. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: Here's how it's going to go. One of these sticks is about to earn their way back into the  game. For your Edge of Extinction challenge, you're going the race  through a series of obstacles getting you to the finish where you must  maneuver a ball through the top of a very long track. First to finish earns their way back into this game. Before we run, during your time on distinction, you've had the  opportunity to earn advantages to help you in this challenge. Some of you were successful. Chris, you earned the advantage of bamboo and string, allowing  do you practice the middle phase of this challenge. Did you put it to use? <br/>Yeah, every morning. <br/>Jeff: You also earned a advantage to disadvantage another  person. <br/>Yes, I did. <br/>Jeff: By giving them 30 knots in the final stage of this  challenge. Who did you decide to give those knots to? <br/>I'm going to assign this to mr. Goliath over here, Chris. <br/>Jeff: So, Chris, you have both an advantage and a  disadvantage. Everybody else, you're on your own. This is the moment you've been waiting for. Let's do it. All right. Here we go. For your shot back in the game, Survivors ready? Go! First you're going the race up the frame. It's a ladder without any rungs. Then it's over the cargo net to untie your bag. Chris is out quickly. Devens is out quickly. There's Keith. There comes Aubry, Wendy, and Reem. You spent a lot of time on distinction for this moment. Whatever is in the tank you need it now. Chris has his bag. Devens has his. Keith has his. Wendy has hers. Aubry has hers. Chris in the lead. Everybody now racing to untie their knots to get to the next  stage of this challenge. <br/>You guys got it. Keep working. <br/>There you go, Rick. <br/>Jeff: Everybody is sill in this challenge. Reem has her bag. Drop and get it. Chris is through first. Starts untying his bamboo. Then Aubry, Wendy, and Devens right on his tail. You're trying to build a bamboo pole long enough that you can  stick it through the cage and retrieve your key. Chris earned the advantage with lots of days to practice. Will it pay off here right now? Aubry now with her stick. Will it be long enough? Aubry very close. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Aubry has hers. Aubry is first to get her key. Aubry is going to get through that cage door first. <br/>She's coming for blood, y'all. <br/>Jeff: Aubry is through, moving on to the final phase of  this challenge. Her job now is to maneuver that ball to the top of the long  track. Chris now going the give it a go. Devens now going to give it a go. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Chris has his key. Devens has his key. <br/>Wow. <br/>Good job, Rick. <br/>We have a challenge. Everybody is fighting right now. Chris is through. Devens right on his tail. Wendy has her key. Reem has her key. Chris now has 30 knots as a penalty assigned to him by Keith. <br/>Come on, Keith. <br/>Jeff: Keith falls short. Got to work on that stick. Reem is through. Wendy is in the final phase of the challenge. Chris feeling the penalty of those 30 knots. The good news is there is a steep learning curve to this final  phase. This is going to require patience. Panic is not your friend in this challenge. Aubry drops and has to start again. Reem drops and has to start again. Devens looking good. <br/>There you go, Rick. <br/>Jeff: Wendy doing a nice job. Very slow, very steady, inch by inch. Moving up this track. Wendy with all kinds of obstacles to overcome, and she is doing  it. It is Wendy and Devens right now in the lead. Chris now has his balls free. He can get in on this. <br/>You got it, Keith. <br/>Jeff: Keith still working on his stick. He's been out there a long time. Going to give it another go. Is it stRong enough? Keith has his key. Keith is going to be in this now. Let's go, Keith! Keith is through. We've got everybody now in this final stage. Wendy is the one the beat. Very close to the top. <br/>Nice. <br/>Jeff: Devens just behind her. <br/>Good job, Rick. Take your time. <br/>Jeff: Chris is back many this. <br/>Mice move, there Chris. <br/>Jeff: Reem struggling. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Jeff: Aubry playing reckless now. She has to. Keith has figured this challenge out very quickly. Keith drops. He's got to start again. Three people in it now. It is Wendy alone in the lead. Chris and Devens right on her tail. Wendy inches away. Can she get it to drop? Wendy drops. Wendy has to start again. Chris now in the lead. <br/>You have plenty of time, buddy. <br/>Jeff: Chris now very close to the top, getting closer and  closer. He's got a steady hand. Is this it? <br/>You got it. <br/>Jeff: No! Chris drops. Inches away from the top. Wow. It is now Devens with a shot. Inches away. Can he drop it? <br/>Oh, my gosh. Still hovering. Devens does it! Devens earns his way back into this game. Devens has done it. That time on distinction was with it. A huge effort by everybody as the tears start to flow for  everyone. <br/>I'm really sorry. <br/>That's okay, dude. <br/>Jeff: Devens, you accomplished the goal of distinction,  which is they there long enough to get a shot and then make it pay off. You are back in this game. Congratulations. [applause]  Devens! <br/>Jeff: Join your new merged tribe. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Congrats, Rick. I'm looking forward to this. <br/>Jeff: Devens has a fresh start in this game, but that's  all you have. And now distinction begins again. <br/>Oh, boy. <br/>Jeff: Every person voted out will have the same  opportunity. All right. You are merging the Manu beach, where your feast awaits. Grab your stuff, head out, come up with a new tribe name. <br/>Before Edge of Extinction the game in a lot of ways was  getting the best of me, but if I can win my way back into the game, I can win  challenges. I'm a whole new man thanks to the Edge of Extinction. <br/>Jeff: Aubry, that's the moment you hope for. That's what kept you going. <br/>"Survivor" has just given me so much in my life,  and I owe so much to this game, and I'm grateful, but I got played, and I got  played hard. I'm proud to stand with these guys, and I'm just grateful to  you, Jeff, and everyone here, because I don't think I would have grown up  without "Survivor."  Jeff: Reem, why are you out here? <br/>Dude, like I've been watching this for 18 years. It's my favorite show. This is no talking, don't call me. This is the kids, come and watch, this it's family time. This is the dream. And I get voted out, and then I end up in hell, man. Like it sucked. But I couldn't raise that mast. I'm proud of myself. <br/>Jeff: Keith, how do you get through distinction? -- extinction in. <br/>The Edge of Extinction, you live moment by moment. You take it step by step, and that past becomes everything that  you want. It becomes the food that you want. It becomes a bed. I'm so proud that I did not give up. <br/>Jeff: Wendy, what are you feeling right now? You're freshly out of the game? <br/>Yeah, I feel kind of bad that I didn't spend as long as  these people on extinction. I went, had a nice rest, and I was back in the game, but all of  you khweis should be so proud that the second you touched the sand on the  beach, you guys are winners, you had an opportunity, not a lot of people  have. <br/>Jeff: Chris, what was the lowest point for you on  extinction? <br/>When I came out here, I wanted to play this perfect game,  and to have that slip threw my hands, and having to embrace that and  understand, like, you can't be perfect, you're going to screw up. But being out there with these guys, you have to put on a face. You didn't have to fake anything. You could just be yourself, and it was like therapy for me. <br/>Jeff: All right. Reem, Keith, Chris, Aubry, Wendy, you have another decision to  make. <br/>Oh, for the love of God. <br/>Jeff: Who wants to go back the distinction island for  another shot back in this game? <br/>Let's do it! <br/>Jeff: Everybody going back. Grab your stuff, head back to the boat. Your adventure continues. <br/>We're back, we're back, we're back. <br/>When you think you've gone low on "Survivor," it  can go so much lower, the lower you go, the higher the highs. When Jeff said that we could come back, I was jumping up and  down like a child on Christmas morning. We're still in. I'm not out of it. I am still playing "Survivor."  Oh, my God. <br/>You look so good. <br/>We arrived at the merge, and I have this overwhelming  feeling of excitement and joy. We are going into this with all of the Kama members back  together some we have eight people if we can stick together. We're going to have the majority. That's an incredible feeling. <br/>How was distinction island? <br/>It's purgatory. The twist is right on your buff. You get a torch, there's map, and there's a boat and a shipwreck. <br/>Of all the faces that I saw doing that challenge, Devens  was the one person I thought, oh, hell no. Like why are you back here now? I don't want him back here. <br/>How are you with the dad bod in. <br/>Dad bod is back in the game. <br/>I'm back, baby. I'm back in the game. But there is definitely a fear that you will be the easy vote  out because you just came back in. Maybe they resent it. Maybe it's just easy. So I need to make a human connection real early so they don't  write me off as the easy vote back to Edge of Extinction before they get to  know me. <br/>I don't know how you feel in terms of your old tribe, but  I didn't know --  They voted me off. So as much as I love them, I'm a free agent right now. <br/>The minute I start speaking to Rick at the merge feast, I  knew that I really liked him, and I fell like he was a genuine person, just  the fact that he had that big hero moment and was able to win a spot back  into this game, like I'm rooting for him. I would never want to see him go back to the Edge of Extinction  so quickly. I mean, it sounds like a scary place that I never want to go to. To. <br/>I new that coming ban was going to be hard, but it's what  I needed. Other people, though, we get back to this island and it's buyers  remorse. Their journey is out of this game. <br/>After I lost, I honestly felt down again, and then it hit  me, if I get off this island right now, I've gotten more than what I ever  came with. <br/>And then there was three. <br/>Then there was three. <br/>I don't think anyone has had an experience like I have. Everything that could have gone wRong did go wRong, but at the  end of the day, I feel so proud of myself, and that's what's most important  for me. <br/>How crazy. <br/>The Edge of Extinction will only heat up. The weak aren't going to survive, but when everyone is crumbling  around me, I know just what to do, and I have a goal. I'm going to get my butt back in this game. <br/> He just came back. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>I'm working with Lauren. We have two idols. That's a lot of power. We can do a lot with that if done correctly. <br/>We need to find a crack. <br/>The problem is I'm in this minority group. I'm going to need every tool that I can given the situation that  I'm in. So I 1,000% have to have a talk with Joe. <br/>How are you feeling about everything? <br/>I feel like we're... I feel like this is second chance  2.0. <br/>Here I am again with Joe freaking inglam. Here he is again in the majority alines. I feel like I'm at his mercy. Why? This is an absolute nightmare for me. We'll see how welke pitch him. This is a sales pitch for me. <br/>I don't know how you feel act those guys after the Aubry  thing. <br/>I don't like it. I don't trust most of my Kamas because it's like they're all  together, but me and Aubry were like... And Aurora. Aurora was on the outs. I feel like I'm on the bottom. It's a weird state of limbo. <br/>I definitely see David and devon going to that side. I see them shifting to that group. That will try to take you out. I'm not coming for you, Joe. <br/>I'm not coming for you. I need you here, too. <br/>I definitely feel like Joe will come with me, but I am  still trying to decipher, figure out this Kama tribe. So I think the best plan is to make it an easy vote, to take out  Rick. <br/>So now we have all the girls. What is this six girl, seven guys? What are you thinking? What's the ideal? <br/>I'm open to hearing all suggestions. We want to get through a safe vote. And Rick's name kind of popped up. He could be an easy vote that everyone could get on board with. That doesn't cross too many lines. <br/>I am shocked Kelley and Lauren want to vote Devens off  first and send him right back to the Edge of Extinction. Just from a moral standpoint, like I don't see how you could  possibly do that to somebody to send them right back to where they came after  facing the odds. <br/>I don't think Rick's bad idea. I don't think it pisses anyone off. <br/>I think we get rid of Devens, tell me Devens or David. I'll do it. <br/>Kelley and Lauren seem so brutal. Maybe one of them should be sent her merry way off to the Edge  of Extinction. <br/>That's a lot of pieces that we can play with. <br/>That's good right there. <br/>You guys need a hand? <br/>Not really. <br/>When I got back to camp, I opened my bag, and there is a  it little something there. I'm trying to keep a straight face. Because I know I got to get away from everyone and find out what  is sitting in my bag. And so I practically run down the path, and I get down the  trail, I unwrap it, and... Holy crap. And it's this beauty. Two pieces with a note. "Congratulations. You have earned your way back in. Staying in may not be as easy. This may help." you must give one half of this immunity  idol to another player. If you're both still in the game after the next tribal council,  these two pieces when used together become one idol with full power. So it's an immunity idol. I can't use it this time. I keep half of it. I give the other half to another player in the game. This may be the only bar dwayneing chip you have to stay in the  game. This idol has no power until after the next tribal council. Holy crap. But it's tRicky because I can't use it this time. So I have to do what I have to do to get past this first vote. <br/>I have something to tell. I have an immunity idol. <br/>Are you serious? <br/>Yeah, but I have to half of it to someone else. <br/>Okay. <br/>Before the tribal. <br/>Are you kidding me? <br/>Yeah. <br/>David's the one I can trust most, so he's the one I feel  like if I have to work this idol with someone else, I'm going to share it  with my closest ally. So obviously I'm planning on giving you the other half. If either of us gets voted out, we're done. <br/>For the first vote, it's not an immunity I'll doll. It's just a bargaining chip. I feel like I might be on the bottom. So I'm scared to death going into tribal council. So I'm scared to death going into tribal council. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. Let's get to your first individual immunity challenge. First things first, Ron. Got to take back tribal immunity. Thank you. Tribal immunity no more. This is now what you covet. The individual immunity necklace. Let's get to it. For today's challenge, you're going to stand on narrow beam  while balancing a statue at regular intervals. You'll move further down the beam, making it more difficult. If at any point you fall off the beam or your statue drops,  you're out. Last person left standing wins immunity, safe from the vote. Losers tribal council where somebody will be the seventh person  voted out of this game. Take your spots. We'll get started. Good luck. All right. Everybody looks good. And this challenge is on, and immediately a huge gust of wind  comes. Ron is first to drop. Ron is out. Your first individual immunity challenge. 13 people in the game. Devens earned his way back in. Could he pull it off right here? Little bit of movement. From Victoria now. Gavin drops. Gavin the second person out. We are down to 11. All right. It is time now to move further down the beam. It's more narrow, more difficult. Start making your move. This is a live transition. So if you drop here, you are out. Wardog can't make the transition. Wardog is out. Everybody else has successfully made the transition. And this challenge continues. You'll be in this section for five minutes. Just like that with absolutely no movement Devens is out. His statue drops. No shot at immunity. Here comes another huge gust of wind. Victoria all've the place. Victoria can't get this one back. More wind. Aurora drops. Aurora is out. Six have already dropped. Seven still fighting. All right. Everybody successfully transitioned to the next phase of this  challenge. We'll stay here for ten minutes. Joe very steady. David with a little bit of a wobble. Witness again that wind picking up, whipping through this field. <br/>My arms are numb. There's a bug on my leg. It tickles. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth, her arms went numb. <br/>I'm sorry. I'm sorry. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth cannot take it anymore. She drops. Wentworth is out. We're down to six. Eric, Julia, David, Julie, Joe, and Lauren. We're 20 minutes into this challenge. It is time the move into the most narrow part of the beam. You have to move all the way down to the end and get toes in the  red. Start making you move. I'll let you know when you get there. Slow and easy. No need to race. Eric can't make the transition. Eric is out. We're down to five. Julia can't do it. Julia's out. We're down to four. And now David with a gust of wind wobbles. He's out. We're down to three.D everybody is good. That transition got a lot of people. Julie, Joe, and Lauren all still fighting for immunity. Been up there 40 minutes. This is not easy. Julie has been very steady this entire challenge. <br/>Julie, you're hot. <br/>I'll take it. <br/>She's buff. <br/>Jeff: Joe has been very steady. Lauren really has the fRont of her pole dipping down now. Joe drops out of nowhere. He had been rock steady. And we're down to two. Julie and Lauren. Here comes the wind now making it even more difficult. Lauren moving all over. That statue holding firm. That wind no joke. Really blowing. <br/>Crap. <br/>Jeff: Another gust of wind. <br/>Crap. <br/>Jeff: Lauren drops. Julie wins first individual immunity, safe tonight at tribal  council. Wow. That was sudden. <br/>Lauren, great job. Great job, lady. <br/>You girls are stRong. <br/>Jeff: Julie, come on over. Julie, first individual immunity win. Safe tonight at tribal council. If you can express what it means the make hit the long and win,  what is it? <br/>I feel like I've been wanting to be on  "Survivor" for 18 years, and to win this first immunity is...  Yeah, Julie. [applause]  I feel like my kids and my husband will be so proud of me. <br/>Jeff: Julie safe tonight at tribal council. As for the rest of you, somebody will be the seventh person  voted out of this game. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. Congrats. <br/>The plan to get out Devens tonight has been discussed with  everyone, and everyone appears to be on board, but there's so many different  ways that it could go. All I know is that I have a hidden immunity idol. I'm very excited that I have that little cushion, because  playing "Survivor" before, I know how crazy voting is after the  merge, so I might have to bring out the big guns. <br/>I would have been scared to death going into tribal  council tonight, but the fact that I'll be wearing the immunity necklace,  there's no blindsides on me tonight. That's like the most comfortable feeling I could have. <br/>I'm dying to talk to you. Kelley and Lauren, we could bring in David and Rick and get Kelley  out. Kelley is a huge threat. As a returning player, she needs to go. These are the kinds of things I knew I needed to start  orchestrateing. I'm not just going along with whatever people are delg me to do. <br/>Everyone on your tribe is throwing you under the bus and  thinks you should go right back there. There's in way in hell I would send you back, there but you have  to trust me. We know you and David look like a pair. We're not goinghtg tell you details of names or who or what, but  you're not going home. <br/>I feel totally betrayed by those three Lesu members to  send me right back is a total stab in the back. But I got people on my side apparently, which is awesome. <br/>Well, let me give you this. This is the half of the immunity idol. <br/>Okay. <br/>Julie said all of Lesu is voting for me. They have no qualms about voting me right back out. <br/>That is such bad game play on their part. <br/>Julie said vote with us tonight and we'll save you. I don't even know who we're voting for yet. But they will tell me, and then they will tell me who to tell you. <br/>It should be Wentworth. <br/>I agree. <br/>Thanks for this, by the way. It means a lot. <br/>We're in it together. <br/>We are, dude. <br/>A whole will the on the line tonight. I feel like if I can get through tonight, then we have that  hidden immunity idol. It could be a whole new ballgame. It might be the path forward in this game I've been looking for. <br/>Right back to work, Joe. <br/>Got to finish it, bro. <br/>We got work to do. <br/>Want to go right now? <br/>I'll go. <br/>Oh, okay. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Hey, buddy. <br/>Hey. <br/>What's the plan? What do I do? <br/>You go follow those guys and make sure they're not on the  chopping block tonight. <br/>Okay. I hope not. <br/>Who do you want to vote for? <br/>I don't know, man. This game moves fast, so a couple different clicks of people get  together and want the make a move. <br/>Joe made a mistake. Joe, who do I voted for, what's going on? He was very vague. It did not make me feel good. Joe is brushing me aside. Right now I don't know that I can trust him. What he doesn't know is my true alliance is Eric. Julie, Julia, Gavin, and Victoria, we're the Kama six. So I'm thinking Joe losing is a great opportunity, because if  you're playing "Survivor" and you have chance to take out Joe,  every time is the right time. And so I've got to convince the Kama six it's Joe tonight. <br/>There they are. <br/>Guys, they're here. <br/>There's one, two, right here. <br/>He doesn't have an idol. He's not expecting it. <br/>Just the six? <br/>What do you mean? <br/>Focus on that one. Focus on that one. Go slow, guys. <br/>Dang. <br/>We might have lost him for now. <br/>Round one goes to the chickens. <br/>Ron wants to do Joe, because Joe lost. Now is the time to get rid of Joe. I would rather go the safer option and get rid of Kelley, but  it's definitely important to get the decision right tonight. It's  Feels good, right? I already talked to Julia. <br/>Okay. <br/>We're just rehashing making sure nothing has changed. <br/>Ron wants to vote Joe. <br/>Where are you? <br/>I'd a go Kelley. <br/>Kelley? <br/>Kelley. <br/>There's a lot of different options tonight. Joe being one of them. I've heard Rick's name thrown out there. I've heard Kelley Wentworth's name thrown out there. There's three very good options on the table. We need to figure out which one will best suit us. <br/>Let's check in. I'm pretty sure we're all on the exact same page. I think we have to take a shot at either Joe or Kelley. <br/>Too soon to get rid of Joe. <br/>Listen, I can see the argument for Joe, but I think Kelley. It can go a million different way, but at some point the six of us  have to come to a consensus. <br/>There is not a general consensus as to who should be voted  out, because all of us can make a different case for why Kelley or Joe should  be voted out tonight, and they're all good cases. It's getting tRicky. It's going very tRicky. It is really important to make the right decision, because the  very first vote right at the merge can dictate the rest of the game. <br/>Jeff: If you don't yet have a torch, grab one and get  fire. We'll now bring in the members of our jury. <br/>What's happening? <br/>Oh, boy. <br/>Jeff: Reem, Chris, and Aubry, after failing in their bid  to get back in the game took the option to return to Edge of Extinction and  await another chance to get back in the game. All right. Julie, what was the feeling with Kama when you realized we were  merging? Was it this could be fantastic for us? <br/>It was the feeling, but we were also really excited to  meet new supreme, peek speak to them, and start playing the game that we  haven't been able to before tonight. <br/>Jeff: Ron, you had a reaction to that? <br/>I love Kama. Everyone knows this. I didn't want to swap. I look down and saw the yellow buff, I said, yep. Then I look down and saw a bunch more yellow. I'm like, this is awesome. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth, are you surprised to be surprised to hear  Ron say he's glad Kama stayed together? <br/>I'm in the minority. It doesn't make me super excited, but over the past few days a  lot of new relationships are forming. I don't know it's so cut and dry. <br/>Jeff: One of the other big stories is Edge of Extinction. You earned your way back into the game. What did you notice about the tribe, the dynamics change all the  time? <br/>All right I don't know the Lesu dynamics since I left. Plus I haven't met anyone on the original Kama. I spent all my time in purgatory. <br/>Jeff: Was there any talk to get rid of Devens saying, we  voted him out once? <br/>Absolutely not. To send imright back, there that's straight-up evil in my  opinion. Why would we get rid of somebody who is not a big threat coming  into the merge? I just think there are bigger targets out there. <br/>Jeff: Joe, what do you read into that in. <br/>Victoria said there are bigger targets. As a stRonger player, that doesn't make me feel good. I now have to have many I little tinglers going off, if you  will. <br/>I don't think I said physical threat, did I? Because there are other kinds of threats. There are strategic threats in. <br/>Did I take it the wRong way if I felt that was directed at  me then it was accurate? <br/>There are other things that are threatening to me, so I  want the clear up what I meant. <br/>Jeff: Ron, what about idols? <br/>People talked about idols. <br/>I think I'm fairly perceptive person, but I can't tell  this anyone has one. No one is mentioning it. It seems like they don't exist. <br/>Every season you feel that way until all of a sudden four  idols pop up in the same tribal. So if there are some idols out there, maybe they're not sharing  that information. <br/>Jeff: Devon, what was the feeling at camp this afternoon? Was it casual? Was it frenetic. Did paranoia kick? <br/>When it came to strategy, nobody wants to tell you who  they're going after. Joe didn't do anything today. He just painted. Are you that comfortable that you don't need to talk to anybody,  or are you that scared that you're not going to talk to anybody. It was weird. <br/>Jeff: What was it, Joe? <br/>I know where I stand with members of my tribe. I home that Kama stRong does stay stRong. I'm relying on those past relationships to get me through this  evening. <br/>Jeff, when you have the majority, you don't need to  scramble so much. We were relaxed because we knew we had the power. We didn't need to scramble. <br/>Jeff: Wow. Wentworth, that's so frustrating to hear, isn't it? <br/>You kind of chuckle, because it's funny that he so  blatantly said, that but if you're me, you're always on the bottom. So...  Jeff: All right. Time to vote. Victoria, you're up. Victoria, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Jeff: If nibiru -- if anybody has a hidden immunity idol  and you want the play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. First vote, Devens. Kelley. David. Devens. That's two votes Devens. David. That's two votes David. Wentworth. We're tied. Two votes Devens, two votes David, two votes Wentworth. David. That's three votes David. Joe. Joe. That's two votes Joe. Joe. We're tied. Three votes Joe, three votes David. Joe. That's four votes Joe. Seventh person voted out and the fourth member of our jury, Joe. That's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Good play, guys. <br/>Jeff: Joe, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Bye, Joe. <br/>See ya, Joe. <br/>You made a big mistake. Easy decision. Left the door wide open. That's the worst thing they could have done.

They have the power. <br/>I'm the puppet master. I'm trying the break them down. <br/>Jeff: And lose control. <br/>One of us is drunk right now. <br/>You're getting played. <br/>I have to find another path the day 39. <br/>Jeff: Prepare for a crash. Medical! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Can you hear me? <br/>The one thing I feared happening happened tonight. I'm trying the keep my emotions together and not break, but  maybe I need to be here. <br/>Sorry, man. We were rooting for you. That's so lame. <br/>The theme of the merge flag was the phoenix. You got to die to be born again. That's exactly what I'm going to do this season.
