<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor: Michael was determined to  make a kill. <br/>Michael: This is the pigkiller. <br/>Jeff V.: His stupid spear. "I'm going to go catch pigs. Go get me a pig."  Jeff: At Ogakor, Jerri and Colby whispered sweet nothings  to each other  Colby: Black coffee, or cream and sugar? <br/>Jerri: Cream and sugar. I'm such a sucker for cowboys. <br/>Jeff: In the toughest challenge yet, Kucha won immunity...  [ cheering] ...sending Ogakor to Tribal Council, where lines were drawn when  Jerri made it clear who her friends were. <br/>Jerri: I've been very fortunate in my ability to bond with  Amber, Mitchell and Colby. <br/>Jeff: But there was no bond with Maralyn, who was voted  out of the tribe. It's time for you to go. 13 remain. Tonight, one more will go. <br/>Tina: I had slept outside Tonight, one more will go. <br/>Tina: I had slept outside last night, as did Keith. We were the first ones up, so we thought the first ones up,  let's just get up and go fishing this morning. So we cleared everything off the boat, got the fishing rods  together. Jerri popped up out of the tent, ran, turned over the canoe...  and acted like she was going to get ready to go fishing. <br/>Mitchell: You guys wanna go? [ canister rattling] You're going to take this? <br/>Keith: Yeah. Jerri and the others, they wanted to take the canoe out. You know, we said, "Well, we're just getting ourselves  ready, we've got all our gear, we're getting ready to go." "Oh, we  were going to do that." Well, isn't that ironic, you know, just 'cause  wewere going to go? <br/>Tina: Well, that's why we were going to go, because you  guys were sleeping, so... [ Jerri groans] I just said "Look, you know,  we were gonna go fishing. You all were asleep. We're going to go fishing." And apparently, Keith wanted to  have a talk with me, so he said, "Well, Tina, let's just go walk along  the bank and fish that way."  Keith: At Tribal Council last night, Tina and I had an  opportunity to get a little bit better understanding of where we sit within  our own tribe. When Jerri was asked the question who her friends are, she made  a point of mentioning Amber, Colby, Mitchell and herself, that they all get  along best. And then, of course, she wanted to make sure that everybody was  clear that she was here to win the money. And she's going to do whatever she has to to win the money. So, Tina and I were a little miffed by that. <br/>Tina: You have four or five young people playing. You know, they've got so much chemistry that it is almost second  nature just to-- whoo-- just immediately gravitate towards one another. And it makes me feel kind of like an outsider, which I am an  outsider at this point. <br/>Jerri: It's all I can do to keep from just laughing out  loud. At Tribal Council, Jeff asked me who I felt I had built  friendships with. And immediately after I said it, I kind of sucked it back up,  because I realized I was basically challenging people to vote for me. Which doesn't put me in a very good position. <br/>Keith: Jerri is perfect for this game. She will ride the team until it's time to take the knife out and  cut someone's throat. <br/>Jerri: That was good stuff. <br/>Keith: I didn't come out here to be pushed around by a  bartender-wannabe-actress. Maybe it's time just to shake her world up a little bit. I can tell you one thing: Tina and I are not going to go down  without a fight. I came here to win the money, but now my motive isn't to win the  money, but to do everything I can to make sure she does not win the money. <br/>Alicia: Wow, what is it? <br/>Rodger: I have no idea. <br/>Alicia: You guys are not going to believe this one. <br/>Kimmi: What? <br/>Rodger: We got a chicken egg. <br/>Alicia: We have a real egg. <br/>Rodger: "For a change of the menu, you must work with  great haste. Build a pen on your beach, and slide the pieces in place."  This morning, we received tree mail. And I went out there to it, and it was a bird's nest. And it involves a challenge of building a chicken coop. <br/>Alicia: Grab one end. [ indistinct voices]  Kimmi: Okay, all of these are pretty much straight. I definitely have to appear that I'm into this challenge,  because my head was on the chopping block-- I know, with a couple of people--  because of, um... you know, my almost not eating the worm and the cow brain  thing. At least this chicken coop thing is a little bit of a change of  pace. I know it might seem ironic, because I don't eat mammals. You know, I haven't had poultry in over ten years, and I haven't  had red meat in over 15 years, but if it boosts up morale for these guys,  it's going to be good. <br/>Nick: Oh, yeah. <br/>Michael: See, what I can do is I can pry this over with my  pry bar here...  Jeff V.: I want those chickens so bad. For one reason, so Mike will quit fishing and walking around  here flexing his muscle. I really want chicken. And I'm not above snatching it out of the other team's arms. I want a chicken. <br/>Jeff: Okay, today's challenge I want a chicken. <br/>Jeff: Okay, today's challenge is a reward challenge. And the map to your reward is scrambled in a puzzle. The first tribe to completely unscramble their puzzle gets three  egg-laying chickens and one rooster. Big reward, a lot of eggs. Pick your spots, and we'll get started. Playing for three egg-laying chickens and a rooster. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Back it up, back it up, back it up. <br/>Mitchell: Go around, rotate, rotate...  Amber: Bring this one up and we'll bring this one down,  over here. <br/>Colby: Right here. <br/>Keith: No... slide it over...  Jerri: That one, that one down. <br/>Rodger: You got it made. <br/>Kimmi: Okay, well, we have this whole side, so now we can  work this... we got to do this piece...  Nick: Yeah, swing this one like this. Goes... no, leave that. <br/>Rodger: Doesn't that blue piece right there go with...? <br/>Nick: It goes in the middle. <br/>Rodger: It goes in the middle, that's right. <br/>Kimmi: Those two need to be together. That should be one, two, three. <br/>Colby: No, no, no, no. [ indistinct voices]  Alicia: That one he's got his hand on. <br/>Kimmi: Okay, hold on, hang on, hang on. <br/>Alicia: Get off of this table. <br/>Michael: Get off, Kimmi. <br/>Kimmi: Well, what...? [ indistinct voices]  Jeff V.: What goes with it? <br/>Alicia: This one goes with it. <br/>Jeff V.: There goes the top corner. <br/>Keith: Wait a minute, look, look, look, look, look. This goes here, and we're done. <br/>Amber: I say... just start doing stuff. <br/>Kimmi: That piece goes right here. <br/>Jeff V.: You had it right. <br/>Kimmi: No, that was right. That one goes over...  Jeff V.: You had it right. <br/>Kimmi: That-that goes down. This goes over. [ indistinct voices] [ all cheering]  Jeff: Good job. [ all cheering] [ indistinct voices]  Jeff: This is your map to your reward. Got to figure out where you're at, where you need to go. <br/>Nick: No, wait, think about perspective. This is our blue, and that's their green. <br/>Alicia: Yeah, "X" marks the spot. <br/>Elisabeth: You guys, we're going straight. <br/>Alicia: There they are. [ whooping] Hello, my lovelies. [ clucking] [ Elisabeth squawks]  Jeff V.: We got chickens. <br/>Alicia: Henrietta, Polly, Ruby and Rocky. <br/>Jeff V.: Hey, Henrietta, hey, Ruby. <br/>Alicia: We all have to decide who's going to kill one. <br/>Elisabeth: I can't believe I'm holding a chicken. <br/>Rodger: Just don't hesitate about putting him in. Get him down in there. <br/>Kimmi: Don't break her wings, though. <br/>Rodger: Who's next? <br/>Alicia: You're gonna squeeze four chickens in there? <br/>Kimmi: It's wrong. <br/>Nick: They're giving you eggs and protein and vitamins and  all that good stuff, okay? <br/>Kimmi: Can't they give us some edamame, some tofu? <br/>Elisabeth: It's a good thing, you guys. You guys, we just won a reward. It's like, everyone just smile for a second-- whoo, reward! <br/>Michael: I felt when we won the chickens, "Oh, no,  I'm unnecessary for food now." They could eat a chicken every other day  and be totally fine, until the merger. And I thought to myself, "Consume those chickens as quickly  as possible so we're back to being hungry again." [ clucking]  Rodger: Shh...  Nick: We woke up in the morning, Rodger and I, relocated  the chicken coop, got them comfortable. And then all of a sudden I see Mike preparing to kill the  rooster. Everybody else is sleeping, and I said, "Let's wake up,  figure out what our day schedule is a little bit more before we kill it  because if we had killed that rooster, a lot of people would have been upset. We have to make decisions as a group for us to get along. ...we should decide as a group when we're going to eat it. <br/>Rodger: That's-that's what I asked him...  Michael: That's what I just asked you. <br/>Nick: We don't need one today. [ rooster crowing]  Elisabeth: That one's going first. <br/>Amber: There's a fire. first. <br/>Amber: There's a fire. You can actually hear the trees falling down and burning. <br/>Tina: You can hear it. I'll put on my tennis shoes. It seems to be getting closer and closer. You can see ash blowing in the wind. We have no idea how close it is to our camp, even though we know  that it has to cross the water in order to get to us. <br/>Amber: It's a concern, um... But you know, I think we'll  be safe, as long as we head for the water and everybody does the right thing. <br/>Tina: And you don't realize that you're nothing to Jerri? She said, "I'm in it to win," and you know, she's  going to do whatever it takes to win. <br/>Mitchell: Yeah. <br/>Tina: She sees that we've got the fishing poles out, jumps  out, grabs the boat, turns it over. And it's like she has to have her way. <br/>Colby: Yeah. <br/>Tina: And I am so over it, I just can't hardly stand it. I mentioned my frustration with Jerri because it's building. I don't know if it's just me. Do other people feel the same way I feel? <br/>Colby: It's going to get a lot worse before it gets  better. <br/>Tina: I'm sorry. She's the most bossy, domineering person I've ever met. <br/>Colby: She's coming, by the way. <br/>Mitchell: Mm-hmm. [ sighs]  Tina: It was a little bit of it just wanting to see how  strong does Mitch and Colby align with Jerri. And my thought was, if I could get Colby, that would be two of  us. And then maybe Colby could talk to Amber, and that would be the  only chance that I would have to make it. At this point, I don't have anything to lose. <br/>Colby: I had to get out of the tent. There's a little estrogen overload in the tent right now, and I  just couldn't deal with that. Tina was taking things way too personally. <br/>Keith: What happened last night at Tribal Council is what  really set Tina and I apart. Jeff said, "Well, who are your friends?" and Jerri  named, you know, four individuals. <br/>Colby: Right. <br/>Keith: And Tina and I are sitting on the sideline. So that was, you know... Tina and I just figured, "Well,  it's just a matter of time now."  Colby: The powers that be have predetermined long ago the  pecking order here, and also the elimination order. And, uh, Keith is up. Keith and I have spent a lot of time together. Part of my reason for doing it-- one, we get along. Two, we need Keith right now, so the last thing I'm going to do  is alienate him. <br/>Keith: I'm cohabiting with people who... what do I do with  these people? <br/>Colby: Yep. <br/>Keith: Who knows, man? You and Jerri could get married. <br/>Colby: I know that ain't happening. <br/>Keith: Tell you straight on right now, she ain't good  enough for you. And you know, it's cool you guys got your little thing going,  but I'm gonna tell you right now, she ain't no way good enough for you. <br/>COLBY [ laughs]: That's funny. <br/>Keith: I would beat you like a dog if I found out you two  hooked up. <br/>COLBY [ laughs]: Well, thanks, bro. <br/>Keith: That girl would cut your throat in a heartbeat. <br/>Colby: Yeah, you're right. [ Rocky crowing]  Rodger: Everybody's on the same wavelength-- we want to  have chicken today. <br/>Michael: I got a confirmation from Nick and Jeff, and  Elisabeth said yes. And if us four are saying yes, everybody says yes. <br/>Kimmi: I say no. Okay. [ sputtering laughter] I guess that doesn't work. <br/>Alicia: Nope. I say do it whenever you want to do it. Just let me know when. <br/>Kimmi: Yeah, 'cause I want to know...  Rodger: Well, we've got to get the water going. I would love to have fried chicken tonight. It would be the first meal where we didn't have to pass a piece  of fish around six or seven times and everybody take a bite of it. Everybody would have their own piece of chicken. <br/>Michael: Oh, it's boiling. <br/>Rodger: Boiling? <br/>Michael: Boiling. Rodger... Do we need anything besides tools? <br/>Rodger: Just a hatchet and a block of wood. <br/>Kimmi: Alicia, I'm leaving. <br/>Alicia: Bye, sweetie. I know it's harder for her. <br/>Rodger: Just gotta look at it, it's no different than  eating them fish we've been eating. I'm gonna hold his wings. Just-just make it a good... one good, clean blow. [ gentle crunching]  Alicia: Mm, mm, mm! <br/>Michael: Everybody was loving the chickens. This could be the end of the game for me, because they no longer  need me for a food source. It ups the stakes definitely for me to catch the food. But to stay in the limelight is going to be harder and harder  because you've got to keep oneupping yourself. I caught one fish, and then I caught a bigger one, then I caught  three fish, then I caught five fish. What am I going to do now, wrestle an alligator? [ laughs]  Jeff V.: I'll take a chicken over fish any day. <br/>Nick: Once you go dark meat, you don't ever go back. [ laughing] [ bird cawing]  Mitchell: I'm just weak. I'm hungry, I'm tired, physically, emotionally, I'm gone. I feel that I think the most about strategies, 'cause first of  all, I don't have much else to think about. And second of all, I want to go far with this. After seeing Colby and Keith talking over in the water for a  couple of hours, who knows what he's trying to convince Colby, but you know  what? Maybe he's just kind of taking Keith for a ride. Colby had been talking a lot to Keith. We know Keith is trying to rear something up from behind to try  to take one of us out. <br/>Jerri: The only way it would work is if Keith convinced  Tina and Colby...  Amber: And Colby. <br/>Jerri: ...to vote against me. <br/>Amber: Right, then...  Jerri: And you and us three voted against Keith. It would be three and three. <br/>Amber: A tie. <br/>Jerri: And then you and me with the most votes, I'd be  gone. <br/>Amber: Yep. <br/>Jerri: This is definitely the first time I've felt a  little bit threatened. And I guess I deserve it after making that pompous remark at  Tribal Council. <br/>Amber: Colby could be talked into things easily. <br/>Jerri: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, too. <br/>Amber: He's not real strong in his opinion. He-he sways a lot between what people tell him. <br/>Jerri: Colby does seem to be the one we're focused on in  trying to ensure he's not changing his mind. Ah... There he is. Did you find a good spear? <br/>Colby: Yeah, I made a couple. <br/>Jerri: Yeah? Cool. Colby was pretty excited about going out hunting for a pig. And I think it's a brilliant idea, especially with the fires  right now, 'cause a lot of wildlife has been flushed this way. Fire pretty much stopped. It's always a possibility that it could jump the river and come  over here. I think it's highly unlikely because there's no wind, nothing. <br/>Colby: See where all the ground's burning right there? <br/>Jerri: Yeah. <br/>Colby: The fire was right there. See? It was right there. <br/>Jerri: Oh! <br/>Colby: We'll walk back. We'd love to have a hog around here. They're here. We've just got to find them, and I'm not having a whole lot of  luck. But I'm bound and determined to put pork on the plate before I  leave this place. I mean, they're not going to live on the water, I don't think. They're going to burrow back aways, and I mean, I don't have a  whole lot of experience with hogs. <br/>Jerri: I think Colby is definitely separating the game  from any relationship with me. I think it takes a strong person to do that, quite honestly,  especially when there's obviously, you know, some attraction between us. <br/>Jerri: Where to, cowboy? <br/>Colby: I don't know. We'll head this way. Who knows where the heck we're going. Jerri's scared. She's worried that Keith and Tina and I are going to join  together and mastermind a back door move to get rid of her. I don't want you to lose an ounce of sleep worrying about what  Tina's thinking or doing or anything like that. <br/>Jerri: I'm not losing any sleep. I'm just... I just know that she's thinking ahead. I just want to beat her to the draw, that's all. <br/>Colby: I'm not saying I'm holding out on making a deal  with you to see how this thing plays out. I'm saying there's no sense in even making a deal, 'cause if we  go into the merge undermanned, it's all for naught, you know? <br/>Jerri: Don't worry about it. You know, it's not like you're making a deal with the devil  here. I'm a little leery of Colby, and I can tell actually that he's  sort of distancing himself from me a lot more. And I like hanging out with you, so, you know, it just makes  sense to me... to approach you with it. <br/>Colby: I'll make you a deal. It's me, you and Amber through to the end. <br/>Jerri: Make me a deal? What is that?! <br/>Colby: Well, you were wanting to strike a deal earlier. Jerri probably wears a name tag that says "puppet  master" on it. She loves having Amber in her hip pocket, and Mitchell in the  same place. I mean, I simply agreed to go along with them just because I  thought it could get me down the road a little better. It's all good. [ Jerri laughs] I want to win, and I don't want to talk to  anybody else about loyalties. Don't give me that crap. I haven't trusted anyone since day one, and anyone playing smart  should have been the same way. <br/>Tina: What about the pigs? <br/>Colby: Nothing. <br/>Jerri: No luck. <br/>Colby: We didn't even see anything. I'm going to have to piggyback your ass over this to keep you  dry. <br/>Jerri: Oh, my gosh. Whoo! Oh, you're all muscle. <br/>Colby: I'm going to need some rest when I get back. I'm gonna die. [ snoring]  Nick: Elisabeth? [ snoring]  Nick: Elisabeth? <br/>Elisabeth: Yeah? <br/>Nick: There's a pig in the water. <br/>Elisabeth: What? <br/>Nick: There's a pig in the water. <br/>Elisabeth: A pig? <br/>Nick: Yeah. <br/>Elisabeth: There is a pig! Right over there. Oh, God, Mike's gone with the knife. <br/>Michael: Why don't you guys come and help me surround him. You guys, I got him cornered here. Just keep walking around the way you're walking. <br/>Nick: Don't charge me. <br/>Michael: He won't. You know, what I want you to do is I want you to block off that  entrance there. <br/>Nick: All right. <br/>Michael: Here he comes. [ pig snorting] [ pig squealing] [ sighing with relief]  Nick: We got a pig. <br/>Elisabeth: What got it? <br/>Nick: He killed it. It was a gross thought, dude. He had to, he had to... I'm so glad Kimmi wasn't here. <br/>Alicia: Yeah. Where is she? <br/>Elisabeth: If she was, she would have died. She would have died. <br/>Nick: It was, it was...  Elisabeth: Brutal. <br/>Nick: ...gross. It was very gross and brutal. <br/>Michael: Life is just a funny little blending of  experiences, and this is just another one. How it will affect me at my end of the tribe, I don't know. It could go either way at this point. But if I go out, I'm going out full. And I'm sohappy about that. [ chuckling]  Elisabeth: Oh, my God. Oh, this is like a murder scene. <br/>Michael: When I butcher a deer, I use a hatchet and a  knife. I think I need to cut the skin more on the top now, too. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. <br/>Alicia: Lots of butchering going on in Kucha camp today. <br/>Jeff V.: This is nothing like a chicken, that's for sure. <br/>Alicia: We've reached a new level. <br/>Nick: This is the craziest thing I've ever seen in my  life. <br/>Michael: This is how I'm going to show up at the immunity  challenge. <br/>RODGER : Pig blood...  Elisabeth: Did you just put that on your face? <br/>Rodger: Yeah, he did. <br/>Michael: Just like that. [ Rodger cheering]  Elisabeth: You're crazy. <br/>Jeff V.: Mike caught a pig. He actually caught a pig. <br/>Kimmi: I cannot deal with these people. I cannot... How big of a pig? <br/>Jeff V.: It's a little one. And there's going to be a lot of ham and bacon and pork coming  up in here... soon. <br/>Kimmi: What is wrong with you people?! This is sick. We live in a sick tribe. <br/>Michael: These are pure, fleshy steaks. <br/>Alicia: The fact that Mike had the guts to go after that  pig says a lot about Mike's character. I can appreciate the fact that Mike did that, you know? And-and Mike did that for the tribe. Mike killed this pig for us so we can all eat. We're having a barbie. <br/>Rodger: Mmm... that's cooked...  Jeff V.: Oh, my God. Mmm...  Alicia: It's good, right? <br/>Michael: I feel better about my position now that I've  made this kill. I think my position in the tribe has come up a few levels,  and... it's a good feeling. <br/>Elisabeth: Whoa, we're going to get strong now. <br/>Colby: A little bit of love. "You all read the books and crammed for the test. So now it's the time for survivor knows best. Head down to the falls with your thinking caps on. If you lose the next challenge, one more will be  gone."  Jerri: First merge with equal equal amounts of people on  both tribes. We can't lose another immunity challenge, so the pressure now is  even more immense than it was before. But the next two immunities are crucial for us and our survival  at the merge. <br/>Jeff: Take back the immunity at the merge. <br/>Jeff: Take back the immunity idol. The immunity idol is now back up for grabs. So, last reward, you guys must be eating pretty well. <br/>Jeff V: We haven't really been eating the chickens much  because yesterday we all went out on a, uh, pig hunt and we, uh, stalked a  pig and, uh, we put a spear right through its heart and, uh, we've been  eating pig for about a whole day. <br/>Jeff: Reaction? They caught a pig. <br/>Colby: We'd like to have one, too. <br/>Jeff: You've been out looking for a pig? <br/>Colby: Yeah, you bet. <br/>Jeff: Well, today's challenge-- certainly more important  than chickens or roosters, even pork. At the end of this challenge, one tribe will return to camp safe  in the knowledge they're secure for another three days. The other tribe will head to Tribal Council, and you will vote  another member out of your tribe. It's a simple question-andanswer game. There are six spots per tribe. You'll start at the back and move forward by filling in the  spots with correct answers. Your goal: be the first tribe to get right here on the yellow  spot and you get immunity. All right? Let's go. Head down, pick the first person. Michael, Mitchell, come on up. Multiple choice: it is possible to improvise a compass by  magnetizing a needle which of the following: A] silk; B] cotton; c] hard  wood; or D] running water. Show me your answers. You both say A] silk. That's right. Take your first spots. <br/>Alicia: All right! <br/>Tina: Good job! Good job! <br/>Jeff: Elisabeth, Keith, come on forward. True or false: the number of flies in Australia increased after  the arrival of Europeans? You both say true. True is correct. Take your next spot. All right, Alicia, Amber, come on up. In order to safely purify water, it must be boiled for at least,  A] five minutes; B] ten minutes; C], 15 minutes or; D] 20 minutes? Correct answer: B] ten minutes. Pick your spot. [ cheering and whooping] Ogakor has a one-point lead. Next two. The answer is true. Take a spot. We're even up. [ cheering] Alicia and Jerri, back of the line. Colby, going against Jeff. True. <br/>Yes! [ cheering]  Jeff: Ogakor in the lead. Kimmi says false, Jerri says true. False is right. Kimmi, take a spot. Alicia and Tina. What was that little thing you just did, Alicia? Is that a little...  Alicia: Just getting ready. <br/>Jeff: Okay. <br/>Alicia: Third time's a charm, hopefully. <br/>Jeff: Of the ten most venomous snakes in the world, how many  live here? A] three; B] six: C] nine... or D] ten? Both wrong. It's nine. See you again in a minute. All right, Jeff, Jerri, you both say true. You're right. Take a spot. Nick, Tina, you're both right. <br/>Nick: All right! <br/>Tina: Thank you, God! <br/>Jeff: Take your spots. [ whooping] Okay, Alicia, come on up. And Mitchell, you'll be the tiebreaker for Ogakor. Here's what I'm thinking: I'm thinking, this tie-breaker's a  little tougher on you, Alicia, because Mitchell at least has already answered  one. <br/>Alicia: Right. <br/>Jeff: He can always fall back on that. <br/>Alicia: That's right. <br/>Jeff: You haven't answered squat. You'll be leading the hike to Tribal Council. <br/>Alicia: Thanks for telling me. Thanks for just reassuring me like that. <br/>Jeff: We're in a tie-breaker situation. If you both get it right, we go again. First person to miss, their tribe loses, they go to Tribal  Council. Multiple choice: Which of the following animals have toxic eggs  which should not be touched? A] gowannas, b] cane toads, c] akidnas or d] bearded dragons? <br/>You both said B] cane toads. You're both right. Going to another question: When building a fire, you should  never use dead wood to start the fire, A]; B] situate your fire near a rock  slide; C] place wet rocks near the fire; or D] use a car battery to start the  fire? For immunity. Mitchell says B] you should never situate your fire near a rock  slide. Alicia says C] you should never place wet rocks near the fire. C] is right. Kucha wins. [ wild cheering] Kucha, you get the immunity idol back. <br/>Amber: We're feeling kind of back. <br/>Amber: We're feeling kind of blah right now and we're not  too excited to make that hike again tonight. <br/>Jerri: And so we prepare once again for the walk of shame. <br/>Mitchell: I'll have plenty to say to the camera when I  hold up Keith's name. He seems to be an instigator, a few problems. So, when he goes, it'll be a sigh of relief for me. <br/>Keith: Jerri likes to think that she is the leader in some  way because Amber and Mitchell, she kind of leads them around a little bit. My goal tonight is to try to step in and break all that up. I'll offer my opinion to the team and see what everyone chooses. <br/>Colby: I don't think he has any idea. <br/>Mitchell: Really? <br/>Tina: He didn't take his fleece or his jacket. <br/>Colby: This, by far, is going to be the toughest council  for me because I don't agree with the order in which the union is voting. Because the person to go tonight is-is a huge asset and could  really, really be an asset down the road. <br/>Jeff: First I think I need to address with you guys a fire  that is burning. Keith, when you think about that, that there truly is a fire,  does it hit you how real it is out here? <br/>Keith: Absolutely. And the fact that the fires are burning so close, what they're  going to end up doing is pushing things that are in the outback towards us. <br/>Jeff: What was your reaction to the fact that Kucha bagged  a pig? <br/>Colby: I'm ticked off that we don't have pigs yet. I'm ticked off that I haven't seen pigs or-or pheasants or quail  or anything of that sort, but I'm not discouraged by that. Why I'm upset is because I play to win, and nothing else is  acceptable in any way. <br/>Jeff: Sort of based on what you just said, Colby, let me  make the observation of the day: Kucha is kicking your ass, and the question  I have is: Does it change your strategy tonight at all in thinking about what  tribe do we need to take to this merge? <br/>Tina: That's the hardest part about this game, because you  are pulled in so many different directions. You're pulled with loyalty, you're pulled with selfsurvival,  you're pulled with team survival. And it boils down to you. You're going to have to be the one to make the decision. And... it's brutal. <br/>Jeff: Well, obviously, tonight's vote is pivotal. Behind me, three torches. Two of the three-- Ogakor. It's time to vote. Colby. <br/>Mitchell: Keith, you add some It's time to vote. Colby. <br/>Mitchell: Keith, you add some tensions with the group at  times, and my hope is that by eliminating you, we eliminate a little bit of  that friction. <br/>Tina: This was not my original intended vote. However, on the way here to Tribal Council, a new scheme was  developed. So, in the spirit of the Olympics, let the games begin. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally your votes. Once the votes are tallied, the votes. Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final. The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. First vote: Keith. Keith. Keith. Three votes, Keith. Mitchell. Mitchell. Three votes Keith, two votes Mitchell. We have a tie. Okay, our first tie. Here's how it'll work: Keith, Mitchell, you will not vote. The other four will vote again. Obviously, big vote for Ogakor. I think it's only fair that I give each of you guys a chance to  plead your case, a chance to say to the tribe why they need you to be to beat  Kucha. Keith? <br/>Keith: I'm a competitor and I will fight to the bitter end  to win for this team and continue to do the heavy work that I've contributed  with the team thus far. I won't give up. <br/>Jeff: Mitchell, why should they keep you? [ sharp exhale]  Mitchell: We all pulled a little fast one on me, but...  but I agree with Keith, actually. I want you guys to win this. I want you guys to go on. I want you guys to beat Kucha. And physically, mentally, emotionally, I'm drained. I wanted very, very badly to go far in this game, but if these  next few challenges are strictly strength, Keith is stronger than I am. I can't compete with that. There's no way I can compete with that. <br/>Jeff: Okay. We'll have a revote. You will vote for either Keith or Mitchell. You are voting to vote them out of the tribe. All rules stay the same, but you have to vote for one of the  two. Jerri. <br/>Jerri: Mitchell, I promised you from the very beginning of  this game that I would not vote for you, and I am staying true to that  promise. <br/>Tina: This game isn't easy. to that promise. <br/>Tina: This game isn't easy. I didn't come out here to starve myself and to face the elements  to keep the weakest person. <br/>Jeff: I'll read the tiebreaker votes. Keith. Mitchell. Mitchell. We have another tie. It seems we're deadlocked. In the Survivorrules, in a deadlock, you go to votes cast in  previous Tribal Councils. The tribe member with the most votes is the person voted out. How many votes have you had cast against you, Keith? <br/>Keith: None. <br/>Jeff: Mitchell? <br/>Mitchell: One. <br/>Jeff: One. One vote is the difference. I need you to bring me your torch. <br/>Mitchell: Okay. <br/>Jeff: It's been a long vote, Mitchell. The tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Well, I have a feeling that tonight's Tribal Council is going to  have a monumental effect on this tribe. Grab your torches, head back to camp. <br/>Jeff: Coming up, scenes from camp. <br/>Jeff: Coming up, scenes from our next episode and  Mitchell's final words. Next time on Survivor:Will Ogakor continue their losing streak? <br/>Colby: Excuses are done, check them at the door and let's  get down to business. It is going to be one hell of a show today. <br/>Jeff: And at Kucha, the feathers fly. <br/>Alicia: I'm tired of you and the ... chickens! <br/>Kimmi: Excuse me? Don't wave your finger in my face! <br/>Alicia: I will always wave my finger at you. You want me to say it to your face? <br/>Mitchell: That definitely took me by surprise. Well, I guess the bright side is, I get to eat, and I need to  eat. Look at me... I feel a little bit betrayed by some of them, but  at the same time, I want to shake their hands and congratulate them for  pulling the wool over my eyes because they definitely got me.
