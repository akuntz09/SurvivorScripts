<br/>Probst: Previously on Survivor: (cheering) The Jalapao tribe was bonding. <br/>Get you some, man. <br/>Wow, so good, so good. <br/>Probst: While Timbira began to splinter. <br/>I'm telling you, it's not going to be perfect. <br/>That's what I think. <br/>You're taking out some frustration. <br/>No, you're taking out frustration. <br/>Probst: When Timbira lost the immunity challenge, the Survivors discovered a  new twist. Brendan, choose one member of the winning tribe to join you at Exile Island. <br/>Taj. <br/>Probst: Taj from Jalapao and Brendan from Timbira went to Exile Island and  agreed to work together, despite being on different tribes. They shared a clue to new hidden immunity idols. <br/>"Then tribal homelands is the thing that you seek."  Our homeland is where we live. <br/>Probst: Timbira, facing Tribal Council, turned their sights on Sierra. <br/>Okay, got it. <br/>Probst: But when Candace turned on Coach...  Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: ...he retaliated. <br/>She got on me. She's going to get on everybody. The cancer will ruin the tribe. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Sierra was saved and Coach got his way. Candace, the tribe has spoken. 14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>The last thing in the world I wanted to do was give Candace any idea that I  was voting for her. And, like, not knowing what everybody else was doing, I was like, oh, my God. This could be the very last nail in my own coffin. <br/>Erinn, obviously didn't see it coming for us voting Candace. And then when she did, she's trying to, she's trying to back out really fast. She's-she's kind of panicking. <br/>You guys were pretty attached at the hips the last two days. <br/>'Cause I wasn't sure about her. <br/>But she was turning on the rest of us. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And you...  But I did know though...  You knew that. <br/>You knew she was turning on the rest of us, right? <br/>But, like, it just really wasn't a decision that I wanted to make lightly  until I felt like, felt like I knew her pretty well. And once I did, I just felt like I could not trust her for a second. <br/>Not only did she align herself with the wrong person-- Candace-- she's has  completely insulted all of our intelligences when we came back tonight and  she said, "You know, I've just been hanging around with Candace the last  couple of days because I just wanted to see what she was up to because I  didn't trust her."  We weren't not getting along. I was very cautious with her. But I wasn't like, "Okay, we're best friends." Well, it's all over  with, so that's good. <br/>For her to say that to us is insulting, which is why she never would have  been in my alliance from the very beginning. And she's made her bed, and she's going to have to lie in it. (theme song playing) Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION  * (coughing)  It's like, why are we doing this again? I go, "Okay, a million dollars, a million dollars."  Yeah. (laughter)  Getting back from Tribal Council was a little weird. <br/>Morning. <br/>Hi. <br/>How you doing? <br/>I think that the time that I spent with Candace in the last few days probably  associated me a little bit with her more than I would have liked. Now I have to turn girl that maybe is kind of on the outs a little bit into  absolutely the opposite of that. <br/>Got to win this challenge today, man. We got to be absolute animals today. <br/>I think it's really important that we win challenges, so I have to go in  there and I have to outperform. Do I think that I can outperform Sierra and Debbie? I think so. I'm just going to have to really, really suck it up and do it because now I  feel like I'm kind of fighting for my life a little bit. <br/>Unfortunately, that's all we've got for breakfast, Jerry. Yeah, but you didn't eat dinner, either. <br/>Oh, my God, yeah. <br/>Well, it maybe-maybe had been what had my, uh, stomach screwed up. <br/>Ugh. <br/>Yeah. Best beans I ever had. <br/>I'm not feeling too hot these last couple days. I don't know whether it's the beans or something I've been eating or  something that's been causing my stomach to hurt real bad. <br/>You're sure not digging in like you usually do, buddy. (chuckles)  Oh, he's taking it slow and steady. <br/>Yeah. I'm used to some type of situations like this when I was in, uh, Afghanistan  or different-- other military spots, so-- I never like to show weakness  anywhere I go. I always want to be looked upon as one of the stronger ones. While everybody is doing their normal activities, I got to pretend that I'm  happy, but really inside, it's miserable. (chuckles) I'm-I'm trying to fight through this. I figure another day or so, I should be good. (groans)  How you feeling, Jerry? <br/>Mother said there'd be days like this. <br/>Yeah. (Jerry chuckles)  There are a bunch over here. You want to move on this side? <br/>Yeah, sure. I see some over here. <br/>There's a couple in there, small ones. <br/>There are a bunch of small ones over here. <br/>There's some right-right under me. <br/>Drop it. He was right here. Let's make sure. <br/>We got fishing gear in the challenge yesterday, and we were all so psyched. We assume... I think we all imagined that we would be feasting on plates of  fish. <br/>I see some over here. <br/>There's a couple in there, small ones. <br/>There's a big one right here. If we can get it over enough, we can catch him. <br/>Toss it far. <br/>One, two, three. You threw it on my head. <br/>I'm sorry. <br/>That might, it might be all right. <br/>No, he got out. <br/>We're having a lot of problems catching minnows. We're not entirely sure how to use the net. J.T. thinks it's a throw net, but it seems way too big for one person to throw. So we... I think we need to figure out a good system. <br/>One, two, three. It's still not easy, but, you know, we figured out, you know, live bait with  the minnows is definitely the way to go. This water is just a little different from where I came from, but we'll get  it under control. <br/>Oh, baby, come on in. <br/>You see him? <br/>Got him. <br/>Woo-hoo! <br/>Attaboy. <br/>All right. Attaboy, J. <br/>Think this may be first fish I've ever caught. <br/>Oh, it is. Good. <br/>Oh, oh! I got one, buddy! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! Whoa! That is a fish. Hello, dinner. <br/>That's right. <br/>My biggest fish yet. <br/>I could eat. <br/>Today is the first day I feel really hungry. <br/>Look at that. <br/>That one looks delish. <br/>Oh, my God. It's like a feast. Mmm. <br/>It's amazing how it doesn't need seasoning. It just tastes well seasoned, doesn't it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Thank you, guys. <br/>Thank you, guys. <br/>Did you eat that skin? <br/>That fish tasted just like victory. Just knowing that we got a little food, finally using the fishing gear the  way it should be used, I think it means that we're just a force to be  reckoned with right now. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Jalapao getting your first look at the new Timbira. Candace voted out at the last Tribal Council. For today's challenge, six members of each tribe will be blindfolded and tied  together in pairs. The remaining tribe member will guide you through a maze. You'll locate your bucket, then make your way to a water tower, where you  must fill your bucket, then race back to the start and empty the water into a  container, raising a flag. You'll then repeat the process, this time collecting corn from another tower. First tribe to fill both containers, raising both flags, wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes, please! <br/>Probst: It starts with this tarp. <br/>Oh! (shrieking)  Probst: It includes an umbrella, chairs, pillows, blankets, and a hammock. In addition, the winning tribe will choose one member of the losing tribe to  go to Exile Island, and that person will select somebody from the winning  tribe to join them. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Give you a minute to figure out who's gonna be blindfolded, who's  gonna be the guide. We'll get started. The caller for Jalapao: Joe. For Timbira: Debra. Here we go, for reward. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>J.T., Sydney, go left. Y'all start moving, Spencer. <br/>Straight! Straight! <br/>Probst: Take a lot of teamwork to figure this out. <br/>Straight, straight, straight! <br/>J.T., start inching left. <br/>Probst: First thing you have to do is find your buckets. Each pair will have a bucket. <br/>I got a bucket. <br/>Probst: J.T.'s got a bucket. <br/>Right, right, right! Faster! Forward! Forward, forward, forward! <br/>Probst: Sierra's got a bucket. <br/>Get on that rail! Go right! Go right! <br/>Probst: Taj has got a bucket. Spencer's got a bucket. Jalapao has their buckets. Now you got to start collecting water. <br/>Spencer, water's to your right! <br/>Water's on your right, right! <br/>Step straight! It is on your right! <br/>Probst: Tyson has his bucket. <br/>Keep going! Keep going! <br/>Here, here, here. Put the bucket right here. Stephen getting some water for Jalapao. <br/>Where's the water? <br/>Straight! Right, right, right! You're there! You've got it, girls. Okay, go! <br/>Probst: Sierra and Erinn getting a little water for Timbira. Spencer and Stephen heading back with water for Jalapao. <br/>Spencer, you're doing great, bubba. Keep coming straight. Slow down. Oh, no! My bad! All right, to your left. <br/>We need to go back and get our buckets. <br/>Probst: Taj now has water, heading back for Jalapao. <br/>Brendan! Where is our bucket? <br/>Brendan, go out straight to your left, to your left! Left! Left! Left! Left! <br/>Probst: Brendan and Jerry doing their own thing. <br/>Okay, Spencer, keep coming. You're right on the holster. You feel the pegs? <br/>Here, here, here. <br/>Okay, now pour. Good job, guys. Go! <br/>All right, let's go back. <br/>Back up, back up. Come back towards me! <br/>Brendan, no! That's not ours! Around the other side! <br/>Probst: Brendan still trying to find his bucket. Timbira in trouble early. <br/>Left! <br/>Come on, baby, let me get it. <br/>Probst: Jalapao, empties their second bucket. <br/>Stop, stop! Get down behind you. By your butt, by your butt, by your butt. <br/>Okay, I got it, I got it. <br/>Probst: Brendan and Jerry finally get their bucket. Timbira falling way behind. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>J.T. and Sydney head back with water for Jalapao. J.T. to your left, bro. To your left. <br/>Tyson is going to lead. You guys follow me. <br/>Let's go, Tyson. <br/>Come on, Tyson, walk! No, not yet. Not yet. Okay, J.T., pour. That's good. <br/>Probst: Jalapao has three buckets in. Timbira has yet to dump any water. <br/>Okay, go, go, go! <br/>Okay, now we're ready. <br/>Straight, straight, Tyson! <br/>Probst: Tyson leading one long Timbira trail. Timbira is in slow motion in this challenge. <br/>Come left! Come left! Left, left! You'll feel Stephen. <br/>Tyson, stop, stop! Left! Follow it to the end. Come straight. There it is. Forward! There you go. <br/>That's the water? <br/>That's water. <br/>This ours? <br/>Probst: Timbira starts dumping their water. <br/>It's right in front of you. Keep coming straight. Yes, yes, yes! Pour! <br/>Probst: Stephen pouring. Will this be enough water? It is. <br/>Let's go! <br/>Probst: Jalapao now looking for corn. Timbira still pouring their water, trying to raise that flag. <br/>Dump it. Okay! <br/>Probst: Timbira very close on the water, but they're going to need a little  more. They got to go all the way back. <br/>J.T., to your left! <br/>Probst: J.T. has the corn. He's filling his barrel... and his face. <br/>Go straight, straight! <br/>Probst: Jalapao's entire tribe is at the corn tower. Timbira still needs a little water. <br/>Right, right! Right! Right! Right there! Forward! <br/>To your right, J.T. To your right, J.T. To your right, J.T. <br/>Probst: Jalapao has worked well together from the start. Spencer and Stephen now heading back. <br/>Debbie, do we need all three buckets of water?! <br/>Just start coming! I don't know! I can't see it! Probst: J.T. and Sydney dumping that first bucket of corn. <br/>Nobody's holding me. <br/>I don't know where everybody is. <br/>Probst: Timbira, really blowing this challenge. <br/>Come on, Timbira. <br/>Spencer, put your right hand down. The trough is right there. <br/>This is it. This is it. <br/>You got to bring more at a time! <br/>Where is it? Where is it? I got it. <br/>That's good. That's good. <br/>Probst: That's it! (cheering) Jalapao wins reward! (cheering)  Oh, my God. I love you guys. (screaming angrily)  Way to go, Joe. (groaning)  Probst: Jalapao, congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: First decision you have to make, who from Timbira are you going to  send to Exile Island? <br/>Brendan. <br/>Probst: Brendan once again going to Exile. <br/>Probst: All right, Brendan, who from Jalapao do you want to join you at Exile? <br/>Taj. <br/>Probst: Same pair going back again. Spencer, does that concern you at all that the same two people are going back  yet again, have time together? <br/>It seems like both tribes are using the same strategy, so I'm not entirely  shocked. <br/>Probst: Brendan, your map, not that you need it. Head down to the beach. <br/>Bye, baby. <br/>Probst: You'll both be back in time for the next immunity challenge. Jalapao, grab your stuff. Head out. You've got a lot it carry. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Probst: Camp life at Jalapao just got a whole lot better. Sadly, Timbira, I got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>We've got to turn it around, just for every reason imaginable: pride, the  rewards, the anger that I'm feeling. Winners find a way to win. Losers find a way to lose. We've got it get it together. (thunder rumbles)  Yes. <br/>Yeah, I know it. <br/>I think we need to have a little talk later. <br/>What happened? <br/>No, it wasn't. <br/>I let out a scream at the end of the challenge, a primal yell that was about  a quarter of what I felt inside because I was just so... I was so pissed off. <br/>If we give in right now to it, it's...  Give in? We're not giving in. <br/>I mean, just like, give in to the anger or the upsetness. <br/>I was totally embarrassed. I mean, there's no other word for it. We were humiliated. <br/>Now, my biggest thing is I just feel like I've let everybody down. <br/>I mean...  Sierra said you guys couldn't hear me. And I was screaming at the top of my lungs. Maybe that was the problem. I was screaming instead of...  It's not like we're not all trying. <br/>No, not at all. <br/>There's nothing about trying. I mean, the last that thing we should do... And I beg all of you to not go  off in groups and say, "Man, you know, Erinn really screwed up today or  Debbie really screwed up today," because that would be the worst thing  we could do. <br/>So, what are you thinking? <br/>People are just panicked in the challenges. Did you see... Have you seen Sierra? <br/>Yeah. <br/>She screams. She's like, "Aah! I can't hear! Aah!" Every time. I'm just like, "Oh, my goodness. I mean, who's worse? Is it Erinn? Is it, you know, Sierra? I mean, obviously, I want to get Erinn out immediately. <br/>One word to describe Coach? I think that's it. "Coach." You know? He's not always the best at what he's coaching, but he thinks he knows the  most. <br/>I mean you, me, Sierra, and Debbie are going to vote Erinn off next. It doesn't matter what Brendan thinks. I'm sure he'll be with us because that's four to three. <br/>He likes his voice to be heard, which is what we all want and all need. <br/>And we only just see things. We don't even have to talk. And I think that's going to be... But as we're getting to know each other,  you know...  Yeah. <br/>The first seven days, I wanted to make sure you saw it the exact same way as  I did. (laughing)  You know what? When he told me I was like his assistant coach, more power to me, you know? <br/>Cool. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Yup, sweet. I'm glad we're seeing it exactly the same. I love it. <br/>But he has a little schoolboy crush on me. People see that. He loves me, you know. So, if I just keep plugging away, I'll eventually make coach. He may promote me. I don't know if I'll have my own team or will be co-coach, or whatever. But people are going to start calling me that. I'm actually going to demand it. If we ever get put on separate tribes in this game, I will demand that the  other tribe calls me "Coach," too. <br/>On three. One, two, three! <br/>Pao! <br/>All right. <br/>Pao! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>We did great. I mean, we did. <br/>That was awesome. <br/>It was like organized chaos. <br/>You did phenomenal. Slow and methodical. <br/>We won. We won the reward challenge today. It was awesome. We work very, very well together. <br/>Coach was pissed. "I'm pissed!"  Hey, if we get this next immunity challenge today, we're sweeping. Timbira's got to be struggling right now with morale. I mean, I think we put it to them pretty good today. I mean, we could really do some damage if we won the next challenge. <br/>Hey, can we get somebody else back here to help lift this up? <br/>We got to run it back here, too. <br/>It's got to come back my way. <br/>Back this way. <br/>It makes a huge difference to have a tarp because we know it's hard to make a  roof rain proof at this point, and I know they're getting soaked and we're  staying dry and that's going to make a big difference on the next challenge. <br/>To say... To say something about the fact that not only are they taking those  pillows and blankets, they took my other blanket and brought it to Exile. (thunder rumbles)  Judging on the fact that Jalapao seems to be a hell of a lot dirtier than us,  they probably need that stuff more than we do. I don't care about comfort. No shelter. Let me bury myself in the sand, get eaten by tarantulas and bitten by snakes. I don't care about comfort anymore. I don't want care about anything else except for winning this game. <br/>You must choose... Each choose an urn. Oh, damn. <br/>Is it empty? I keep doing the same thing. Oh, no. I got it this time. Open in private. All right. I'll be back in two seconds. <br/>Okay. <br/>Clue Two. "You must search around. You can and you should. The item desired is surround by wood."  Uh-oh. (Taj laughs)  What do we got? <br/>It's back home. It's surrounded by wood. <br/>We got another clue. <br/>We got another clue. We got another clue. <br/>Oh, perfect. Perfect! <br/>Oh, good. Brendan and I back in Exile Island. He's kind of working right along with me. We both have the same goals in mind in that we're trying to find the idol so  we can both be safe in the long run. So, then, we have at least three days... Or two days after we get back from  Exile to find it on our own. <br/>When I get back to camp, I'm going to look for the idol immediately and the  first place I'm going to look is something that's surrounded by wood. When I hear, "surrounded by wood," I think of my shelter. I think of the tree mail area. So that's probably where I'll take a peek. The key is getting the immunity idol. <br/>I know. If we don't find it by the time somebody else gets here and gets a clue, then  we're outed. Unless we can convince them to send us again. <br/>God... Hopefully, we can and we'll work on that. <br/>Right. <br/>But if we can't, who else do we send? <br/>Steve. Do Steve and I'll prep him before the next challenge, so he'll know. <br/>Okay. So then, like, I'll go to Sierra. <br/>Are you sure you can trust Sierra? <br/>Yeah, I think I can. <br/>Okay. <br/>I'll make sure. <br/>You work Sierra. I'll work Steve. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Once we make it to the merge, we would have a four-way alliance that nobody  knows about. <br/>That nobody knows about. <br/>Exactly. If Brendan and I can line up our cards exactly the way we want them, we'll  have a secret four-way alliance that no one knows about. This is going to slap them behind the head and they won't even know it was  coming. <br/>You're the best accomplice ever. Ever! (laughing) (thunder rumbling) *  Overall, though, I was happy that it rained. I knew they were getting wet. <br/>Oh, my God, except for T.G. <br/>Yeah, I try not to think about T.G. (indistinct talking)  Yeah. <br/>You all right? <br/>I'm great. Last night was cold and raining and miserable. But for Jalapao, it was awesome. We had the best sleep of our lives. We had our blankets, we had our new shelter, and we had the knowledge that  Timbira was having a miserable night. So that made us all sleep pretty soundly. <br/>Oh, dear. Oh, boy. (laughing) You know, Jalapao is looking great. I hope Timbira doesn't have it together 'cause if we got 'em on their heels,  now is the time to put 'em down, and that's what I'm hoping for. *  Probst: We'll now bring in Brendan and Taj returning from Exile Island. <br/>What's going on? <br/>Welcome back, T.G. <br/>(laughs)  Probst: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>OTHERS: Yeah! <br/>Probst: First things first. Sandy, I will take it back. <br/>Okay. Bye. We'll see you soon. <br/>We don't think so. (laughter)  Probst: Let's get to it. For today's challenge, two members of each tribe will race to roll a large,  tri-colored crate back to your mat. Once you've gathered all six crates, you must stack them to build a staircase  that spells out your tribe name. First tribe to correctly stack the crates and get all their tribe members to  the top of the tower wins immunity. Losers, Tribal Council, somebody going home. Big enough stakes? <br/>OTHERS: Yeah. Yes. <br/>Probst: Give you a minute to strategize; we'll get started. First pair for Jalapao: J.T. and Taj. For Timbira: Brendan, Debra. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Come on, guys, come on! <br/>Go, guys! <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>Let's go, T.G.! <br/>Good job, Brendan, Debbie. Let's go, you guys got it. <br/>Yeah! Come on, guys! You got it! <br/>Good job, y'all! Straighten it out. <br/>Probst: J.T. and Taj doing a nice job. They'll be back first. Stephen and Sydney out on the course for Jalapao. Sierra and Tyson out on the course for Timbira. <br/>(indistinct shout)  Come on, guys! <br/>Come on, Sierra! (indistinct shouts)  Come on, you guys! <br/>Come on, Stephen! <br/>Keep it straight! <br/>Probst: Tyson and Sierra making up a lot of time for Timbira. Next two out for Timbira: Erinn and Coach. Stephen and Sydney have lost a lot of time on this round. Joe and Sandy out on the course for Jalapao. <br/>Get it started, Joe! <br/>We're still ahead, you guys! <br/>Come on, guys, go, go, go! <br/>Come on, Erinn! <br/>Come on, Coach! <br/>Probst: Brendan and Jerry now out on the course. J.T. and Spencer now out on the course. Both tribes have three crates left. <br/>Come on, guys! You got it! <br/>Probst: Jerry gets hit. <br/>Come on, Jerry! <br/>(speaking indistinctly)  Probst: Brendan and Jerry back for Timbira. Jerry's hurting. <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>Probst: J.T. and Spencer. Joe and Stephen out on the course. <br/>Come on, boys! You got it! <br/>Probst: Timbira back with their fifth block. Tyson and Brendan back out on the course. Spencer and Taj going out for their final crate. Timbira with a big lead. <br/>(indistinct shout)  Come straight this way! Keep it straight! <br/>Probst: Spencer and Taj still fighting. Brendan and Tyson back for that final crate. Start working on it. <br/>This will be our bottom block, you guys. That's right. That's right. <br/>Probst: Keep digging. Get it over there. Jalapao's back. Start working on it. <br/>I think this is gonna be the first step right here. <br/>Push. <br/>Probst: You're building a staircase that will spell out your tribe name. <br/>Right here. This is it. Okay. <br/>All right. Now this one. <br/>This one, it's this one. It's this one; it goes there. <br/>Probst: Erinn is leading her tribe. <br/>And then that means that you have half an "A" on that side. That's right. That's right. <br/>Probst: Giving Timbira a big lead. <br/>...two, three, lift. Go. <br/>Probst: Everybody working together on Jalapao, still staying in there. <br/>Now twist it around. (indistinct talking)  There's "R-A" right here. <br/>All right. <br/>This is not a diagonal, though. This is the top block. <br/>No, this is gonna be the side over there. <br/>No. <br/>Are you sure? <br/>"T-I" is right here. <br/>Come here, look. T-I-M-B-I... The "A" is gonna be up top here. <br/>So is that it right there, because on the other...  No, it's right there; it's right there; it's right there. <br/>We need to go. <br/>Probst: Timbira now slowing down. (indistinct talking)  That's it. That's it. <br/>Let me get up a little quick. (groans in pain) All right, hold on. Go. <br/>Coming down. <br/>Probst: Jalapao slides another piece into place. If they're right, they are very close to winning immunity. Timbira losing their lead. <br/>(shouts indistinctly)  Probst: It's gonna be very close. Each tribe has one crate left. <br/>You got it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>(yells)  Probst: Sandy is getting crushed by the crate. <br/>Everyone grab a corner. Jerry, help us out. <br/>Help him pull it. <br/>Jerry, pull it up. <br/>Okay. Okay. I got it. <br/>Now we have to turn it. <br/>We got it. <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Don't fall. <br/>Hey, everything down here fits. <br/>Probst: Jalapao has it! Everybody's got to go up the staircase! <br/>Let's go! We got it! We got it! (shouts indistinctly) We got it! <br/>Probst: J.T.'s across! Spencer's across! Jalapao wins immunity! (cheering, shouting, whooping) *  I'm beat. <br/>Probst: Jalapao, congratulations. <br/>(whoops)  Yeah! <br/>There you go, girl. <br/>(laughs)  Probst: Jalapao, I got nothing for you. You guys have the night off. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>(whoops)  Probst: Timbira, momentum has definitely shifted. Three straight wins by Jalapao. Another loss, another trip to Tribal Council, another tribe member going home. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal tonight. <br/>I feel a great deal of responsibility for the loss today because I couldn't  give it my all. I'm weak. I'm-I'm real weak. My stomach just feels so bad. It's like, uh, somebody's in there with... two boxers in there boxing around. But, uh, I'm pretty sure that everybody started looking at me like, uh,  "Jerry's not getting any better. He's probably the weakest link on the tribe, so maybe get rid of him."  (bird squawks)  How you feeling, Jerry? Better? <br/>I'm gonna go take a dip. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jerry, there's some extra water over here. Do you want me to fill your canteen? You sure? <br/>Yeah, I got plenty here. But I felt pretty good when we went down and got that first block, but after  that all my energy was zapped. But I'm trying to... trying to... endure. Trying to tough it out best I can. I'm not gonna quit, though. That's for sure. I'm not a quitter. (chuckles) They got to vote me out. I'm not giving up. <br/>I think we had a communication breakdown at some point today, and I can't  quite figure out what it was. <br/>We got this, we're just... it's just the beginning of the game. <br/>We're just one behind. We're one person behind now. <br/>Yeah, it's, like, no big deal; we'll figure it out. Is Jerry okay? <br/>The beans are making him sick, and that's all we... you know, we can't eat  all the rice. <br/>Shut up. <br/>'Cause he won't eat the beans. <br/>He can't... he hasn't eaten, really, in... since you've left. <br/>The most unfortunate thing about this whole situation is that as soon as  Erinn realized that Jerry was not sick, she turned around and looked at the  tribe with the evil sneer, kind of like... "I'm staying."  What? <br/>I'm so pissed off, man. When she saw Jerry, it registered that she was still staying. She went... I'm not kidding you; I practiced her look. She went like this. It was the evilest look. I can't stand it, man. <br/>That's why I'm talking to Jerry and telling him to stay strong so we can get  rid of her. <br/>I think my relationship with Tyson started out like head coach/assistant  coach. But I go to him first because if he's my right-hand man, if he's my general,  then I want to make sure that we're clear with our orders. <br/>Let's still go with Erinn. But Debbie and Sierra, those are the two I'm gonna have to talk to. <br/>I mean, we're only as strong as our weakest link. <br/>Well, yeah, she did know she was going home if Jerry wasn't sick. <br/>Yeah, and it just makes me sick because I-I exist... to surround myself with  people that have integrity, and I cannot exist around people like that. You guys can because you can socialize with them. I am so true... that existing around people that smile evilly when somebody  else is on their knees kills me. I can't exist around... I can't look at her in camp, I can't walk by her now. <br/>Coach is definitely pissed about voting out Jerry, but I am honestly not  going to sever off another limb so that we can get our vendettas against  Erinn. <br/>She's still an asset to a certain extent. In the beginning when they saw me sick and they saw me weak, they were gonna  vote me out. So, as much as I have grown to actually like and be fond of Jerry, I'm not  gonna be stupid. <br/>You gotta stay strong, man. You gotta... stick it in there if you can, you know. Don't... yeah, don't give up. <br/>Yeah. What do you have in mind? <br/>Erinn. <br/>Erinn? <br/>She was right on board with Candace. To me, it looks like she's just here to lie and deceive and... you know, get  ahead any way she can. <br/>Has anybody been talking about voting me out? <br/>No, nobody has. You try and look as strong as you can. Don't say anything to anybody. <br/>Yeah. (thunder rumbling)  With Tribal Council coming, I I knew I only had a couple of hours to get my  act together and go look for the idol, and so I immediately kind of went to  the one place that made the most sense to me, and that was kind of the statue  next to tree mail. And I got up to it, and, like, started shaking the thing, and nothing  happened. And I finally just, like, pushed it out and, like, tried to look underneath  it because I thought it might be there. It wasn't there. And then just started kind of feeling around and looking at the skirt, and  then kind of lifted up the skirt on the backside of it and saw a little hole  and there was the idol. Yes! That makes not eating for a couple of days worth it. Good, good, good news. It all worked out. You know, the plan worked, which was perfect. As an entrepreneur, when I think about business, like, to me it was never  about making money, and even with Survivor it's not about making money. I love winning games, I love playing games, competing and winning them. So as long as you're focused on doing something that you love and you're  playing the game the right way, good stuff happens. Keep my fingers crossed. <br/>Jerry, you want some beans? <br/>Like you don't want to be like, hey, everybody, Jerry's sick, but you kind of  want to be like, hey, everybody, Jerry's sick. And trying to, like, wrestle with all these options of, like, how do you  bring it up delicately, how do you make it look like you're not trying to  throw someone under the bus or save your own ass because every time we send  someone home who doesn't want to be here it leaves a space for someone who  does and I want to be here so see you, Jerry. <br/>Where's the thumb meter? Sideways? <br/>I'm doing better. Thumb is sideways right now. It was down; now it's sideways. <br/>It's moving up. <br/>Yeah, it's moving up. Taste of a good cheeseburger, I'd be back on top. (laughing)  Yeah, I think Jerry's illness has put a couple of eyeballs on him. I mean, if he's in pain and can't compete in the challenges, if he's the weak  link and it comes to Tribal Council, he could be the next one to go. But anytime there's a blindside, it's pretty awesome, just the look on  somebody's face. I think Erinn wants to be here so, so bad, that her getting blindsided would  look really cool. I love seeing people cry when you crush their dreams. <br/>Probst: Tyson, let's talk about momentum. Jalapao clearly has it. How important is it in a game like this? <br/>Momentum's extremely important. I think we got a little bit arrogant, and they're on a high right now, and  we're on a low. I mean, it doesn't take much to regain momentum, just a win. If we can all focus and get together then it can flip-flop pretty fast. <br/>Probst: Well, what I noticed today in the challenge was Erinn right off the  bat said, "I have a plan, let's follow it," and it was over. <br/>That's exactly what happened. I said, "This piece goes here." Everybody said, "No, no, no,  that's not right." People panicked and we all did nothing and then went,  "Oh, yeah, okay, that is right." And it was too late by then. <br/>Probst: How frustrating is that for you when you felt like you knew it all  along? <br/>I... it was just frustrating. <br/>Probst: Brendan, do you think this group communicates as well as it needs to? <br/>I think we communicate very well. <br/>Probst: Jerry, you were shaking your head back and forth as fast as you could. <br/>Well, for instance, in today's challenge, if we'd of had a controlling person  to say, "Okay, you got it; we're all going to listen to you, bam."  But that didn't happen. We just need to establish a leader. <br/>Probst: Who should it be, Jerry? <br/>I think it should be... Brendan. <br/>Probst: Coach, you agree with that; Brendan's the guy that should be leading  this tribe? <br/>Being the devil's advocate, let's say Brendan is the leader; he has to take  the reins. I'm not suggesting that I'm the leader, but on the truck I was making eye  contact with everybody and the reason why it worked so smoothly is because I  basically told everybody with my eyes to get what they needed to get. <br/>Probst: So it sounds like you should be leading. <br/>Well, absolutely, I would love to be leader. That's what I'm used to doing. <br/>Probst: Erinn you had about five different reactions. Just share one with me. <br/>I think it's a role that Coach is used to. It's a role that he would love to be in, but it's something that Brendan does  better. <br/>Probst: Coach? <br/>Again, I'm not criticizing Brendan, but we've lost three challenges in a row  and for her to be so quick to say that, I think comes more to a personality  clash between us two. <br/>I didn't know we had a personality clash. You have these great ideas, but I don't ever see you saying more than,  "Well, I have this idea, but you guys do whatever you're going to  do."  Probst: So you're saying he's a little passive-aggressive, throwing throwing  out an idea, but not owning it? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Probst: Coach, is that hard to hear? 'Cause it sounds like what you're struggling with a little bit is ego. <br/>It's not about ego because I would rather toe the line and be a good  assistant coach than try to be a head coach and stroke my ego. What I was doing was I was justifying why I should be the leader, and why I  registered surprise when Erinn said it's Brendan. <br/>Probst: Jerry, how is tonight's vote going to make this tribe better? <br/>I think tonight's vote will make this tribe better because it will get rid of  the weakest person. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to vote. Coach, you're up. <br/>I hope you feel better. <br/>Love you, sweetheart, but we made a decision. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Jerry. Jerry. Two votes Jerry. Erinn. Two votes Jerry; one vote Erinn. Jerry. That's three votes Jerry; one vote Erinn. Third person voted out of Survivor: Tocantins: Jerry. That's four; that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Jerry, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Well, according to you guys, tonight's vote was all about making this tribe  stronger. Time will tell if you made the right decision or not. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

I don't know what happened to my stomach, but in 130-degree heat and me not  being able to eat anything took a toll on my body. I'm hoping and praying that one of my tribe members will win that million  dollars.
