<br/>Probst: Parvati, come on out.  <br/>I have to win this time. It's my second time. I am not  coming back here to starve and be miserable. Outwardly, I'm still going to be  flirty, but I'm playing smart this time. I've put us in an alliance without  you being there. I would absolutely say that my game was a lot more  cutthroat.  <br/>Probst: Ozzy.  <br/>All the girls are coming together and spinning the guys  around as much as we can, and then we're devouring them. I don't feel like I  could have played this game better, and I feel like I can stand up tall and  be like, "I am a survivor." [ cheering and applause]  <br/>Probst: We're live in New York City. We've just finished  one of our most enjoyable seasons of Survivor,thanks to a fantastic group.  Let's start by congratulating our winner, Parvati. Nice job. [ cheering and  applause] You said it yourself, that you came into this... everybody who was  a favorite came in with a label. You were the flirt. Did you have an idea  that you were going to start playing as hard as you did on day one when you  came in?  <br/>Oh, God, no. I wasn't going to start playing in the  beginning. I was going to fly under the radar and play the flirt and let  everyone underestimate me. Jonathan....  <br/>Probst: Penner.  <br/>...outed me and said, "This girl's a threat; we got  to get rid of her." And I was like, "Okay, I got to start  playing," got my head in the game, and started making moves.  <br/>Probst: When did the idea for the women's alliance first  come to you-- you guys?  <br/>Honestly, I came up with that when we had the switch up. I  didn't have the numbers anymore, and I saw that Nat and Alexis were pretty  unbreakable, so I pulled them in. And then I said, "There's no way I can  beat Ozzy and James." So we got the women together.  <br/>Probst: Was the biggest move for you bringing in Alexis  and Natalie?  <br/>I would say yeah. With the women that I brought together,  we had this game on lock. Like, these girls-- I couldn't have done it without  the girls that I was with, because everyone played their part. Everyone was  so brilliant at manipulating and getting in people's heads and ruining  people, basically. [ laughter]  <br/>Probst: It also seemed, Parvati, from a strategic point of  view, you bring in Alexis and Natalie while Amanda's not around. You now have  two girls on one side; you have Cirie and Amanda on the other.  <br/>Yeah. I mean, that was also in my mind. I was, you know,  the pinnacle of that alliance, and I knew... I knew that Alexis and Natalie  felt more loyal to me, and Cirie and Amanda felt more loyal to me. So however  the chips fell, I knew I was in a safe spot.  <br/>Probst: Amanda, let's talk about some of the records you  now hold on Survivor.  <br/>Quite a few, Jeff.  <br/>Probst: It's true. Record number of days on the show--  78.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: You went back-to-back seasons, made it to the  final. You won the challenges that let you dictate who you'd bring with  you.  <br/>In the same, the same, the last two in both.  <br/>Probst: The last two.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: You also... both of your original alliances made  it to the end...  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: ...which is pretty spectacular. But you don't  win.  <br/>I know. It's a problem I'm having. [ laughter]  <br/>Third time's a charm.  <br/>Probst: What is the wear and tear, emotionally, when you  go through this? Especially, you did it back-toback. You and James came back  from China, you had a few weeks to recover from the bites, and you went back  out. Where is your head at now after playing a game this long that's about  deceit?  <br/>Oh, my God. It is so hard to go back to real life. And  you're just... honestly, this has been my life for a while now. Like, I know  it's a game, but it's been my life. Like, this is what I've been doing for,  like, two seasons now in a row. And you get back to reality, and it's just,  you know, you have trust issues, and you just... [ laughter] Seriously. You  don't trust anybody. And you're like, "Maybe they're not telling me the  truth, and maybe they're just, like, trying to say that to make me think  something else." You know? It's hard. It's really hard.  <br/>Probst: And what does it feel like right now, not winning  again? Because you're one of the strongest players in the game.  <br/>It sucks! I know, and it's frustrating. But, I mean,  honestly, like, at the end of the game, it's not up to you. It's up to  different people. And different people vote for different things, and you  don't know what they're going to vote for or respect or like, and it's...  honestly, it's, like, impossible to guess. All you can do is get yourself to  the end. And then from there, just.. it's up to the jury. It's out of your  hands.  <br/>Probst: Cirie, how many nights have you spent thinking  about that last challenge?  <br/>Oh, let's see, what day is it now? [ laughter] Every  single night. Every single night.  <br/>Probst: Was that your only mistake, your biggest mistake,  if you can call it a mistake?  <br/>Honestly, yeah. I feel like the only mistake I made in  this game was not winning the last immunity challenge. But for that, who  knows? [ laughter]  <br/>Probst: Tell me about the women's alliance. Did you guys  sit and talk about how easy... how easily the men were being  manipulated?  <br/>Well, I mean, kind of. [ laughter] I mean, it was...  <br/>Probst: Did you know it was going to work?  <br/>Certain things with certain people... [ laughter] I kind  of... I mean, you can... you have to be able to read people to know, you  know, like-- sorry you touched the stove-- but this thing that happened with  Erik I would have never tried with Penner, because I knew it wouldn't work  for him.  <br/>Probst: So you had the right group of times at the right  time.  <br/>We had the right group of guys. They were younger. They  were a little more naive. And, you know, that's why it worked. Gina, I love  you. I'm praying for you.  <br/>Probst: Okay. It's Mother's Day. It's all right. Natalie,  you come out of nowhere as this raving fill in the blank. [ laughter] What's  been the reaction to you on the street?  <br/>You know, I've had some pretty nasty responses on MySpace.  I have some haters, which is cool.  <br/>Probst: Is that... is that representative of you? Because  you seemed to relish the role.  <br/>You know, actually, I knew going in that I had to really  play under the radar, because I'm very opinionated. I'm very stern and stoic  in my beliefs, and I am not shy about letting people know what I feel. So I  knew going in I had to play under the radar. And then when it was time for me  to come out, I came out. And it's okay.  <br/>Probst: Is that you?  <br/>There are a million layers to me as a human being. I'm a  very complex individual.  <br/>Probst: Is that one of them? [ laughter]  <br/>I'm a loving, kind, generous, amazing human being, and  that's one of the layers. That's one of the pieces of the pie. Yes, it is,  absolutely, 100%.  <br/>Probst: Alexis, you're the only woman that got blindsided  by your own women's alliance. What's that feel like? It's got to hurt a  little bit.  <br/>It hurts a lot. But I think that there's this constant  duality while you're out there where we get it. We know what we signed up  for. We know it's a game. But at the same time, it's a testament to what  Amanda is saying. It is so personal. And it takes a little while for your  heart to catch up with your head.  <br/>Probst: Well, it was masterfully done. I must say. And  thanks, in large part, to the women's alliance, it was one of the most  unpredictable seasons we've ever had with some of the biggest blindsides and  dumbest moves. [ laughter] Second person voted out of Survivor: Fans vs.  Favorites, Mary. First blindside. Mike. Joel.  <br/>I found the idol! I found the idol!  <br/>Probst: Ozzy.  <br/>The real hidden immunity idol.  <br/>Probst: Jason. Alexis. You guys are perfecting the art of  the blindside.  <br/>I want to give individual immunity to Natalie.  <br/>Probst: 13th person voted out and the sixth member of our  jury, Erik. I think that is what you call a life lesson. [ cheering and  applause] Ozzy, did you ever consider playing the idol?  <br/>Oh, hell, yeah. I considered it. I considered it about  five times before we got up to that point. But...  <br/>Probst: Why did you not play it that night?  <br/>Well, it's risky. It's just... honestly, if it had been  anyone else but Parvati on my side, I probably would have played it. But you  know, I went into the game with a relationship with Parvati, and it...  it's... I knew I needed to trust more than I was trusting in Cook Islands.  And you know, I said it before; that ended up being my downfall. And I had a  lot of harsh words for her at the end, and it... you know, it's like I can  understand how someone might be able to kill in the heat of passion. [  laughter] But at this point, you know, I've... I've... I've forgiven, and I'm  over it. And it's... you know, she's an amazing girl, and she's... I respect  her a lot. [ applause]  <br/>Probst: So the relationship has healed?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: All right. Jason, first of all, you find... you  find the fake idol, which leads to one of the greatest lines ever uttered on  Survivor, Eliza.  <br/>It's just a bleeping stick!  <br/>Probst: Yes. [ laughter] Which, by the way, what was your  reaction when you... you thought he had the idol, and then you see this thing  that Ozzy made.  <br/>Oh, yeah. I thought he was pulling one over on me. I mean,  I opened my bag thinking he'd put the hidden immunity idol in there. And I  was like, "Well, he can't possibly think this is the hidden immunity  idol, so what's he trying to pull?" And I storm down to the beach and  kind of give him a peace of my mind, and at that point, I realize he did, in  fact, think that the stick with a face on it was the hidden immunity idol,  and I knew I was done.  <br/>Probst: So, Jason-- and we adore you-- but you watch your  idol, Ozzy, make the fatal mistake of not playing the idol. You think you  have the real one. No. You get another lesson. That's not the real one. Oh,  now I have the real one, and you do the same thing! How many sleepless nights  have you had?  <br/>Uh, more than I'd like to think about, you know. It was...  just it was a mistake, you know, lack of logical thinking. And I should have  seen it coming with it happening to Ozzy. And yeah...  <br/>Probst: I mean, you end up with a souvenir. That's  basically it.  <br/>Yeah, yeah. I got it right here.  <br/>Probst: I'm sure you do.  <br/>So, you know, I got this sitting home on my desk to remind  me of that mistake that I made all the time. And it was, you know, just a bad  move and something I'll never... never let down.  <br/>Probst: Well, and James, you're just delighted to have  somebody in your club. [ cheering and applause] You're not the only one. Ozzy  and Jason certainly put themselves in the Survivor hall of fame for dumb  moves, but they pale in comparison to Survivorfan Erik. Dumbest move ever?  Perhaps. It's true. Plus, Fans vs. Favorites,did one side have a distinct  advantage? We'll find out when we come back. back. [ cheering and applause] [  cheering and applause]  <br/>Probst: You are you going to compete against some of your  favorite survivors from seasons past.  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>Probst: Come on out! Jonathan Penner. Parvati.  <br/>The fans versus favorites setup is the ultimate challenge,  because we have the favorites; they're coming in here with the experience.  But at the same time, you have us, and we know their game.  <br/>Probst: Yau-Man!  <br/>Probst: Yau-Man! [ cheering and applause] [ cheering and  applause] Welcome back to the Survivor: Fans vs. Favoriteslive reunion show.  Penner, did the favorites have an advantage this season coming in?  <br/>Absolutely. I mean, I think I was the... I did the worst  at Cook Islands. I was seventh from the last. So I think between the ten of  us, we figured we had about a year's worth of Survivor experience between us  hitting the beach, and that gave us an incredible advantage. We have a fire  within a day. We had two shelters within a day, a cave in another day. We  were catching food within 24 hours. And they couldn't catch us,  honestly.  <br/>Probst: Yau-Man, what's the downside, the disadvantage for  the favorites?  <br/>Well, the fans have seen all of us in action, so they know  everything about us. They've gotten... you know, they know exactly how we're  going to play, and we have no idea who they are. That's their  advantage.  <br/>Probst: Which is why you're sitting third out?  <br/>Yes. [ laughter] I'll take any excuse I can get. [  laughter]  <br/>Probst: Ami, you... the game really shifted, it seemed  like, with you. You were the first favorite to go before a fan. Did you feel  it turn?  <br/>Wait a second. Fairplay went before me, and so did Yau.  Hold on. But yeah, I definitely felt a turn, like, "Okay, this game is  completely shifting, and now it's everybody for themself," and I was the  first one to realize that.  <br/>Probst: What's it like for you doing this two times?  <br/>It's been awesome. I've been really doing a lot of  charity, and I'm bringing together a lot of the survivors, and we're going to  be doing a lot of charities together. So... awesome [ cheering and applause]  <br/>Probst: Well, when it came to the fan side of this idea,  Erik was exactly what we had in mind. He knew the game. He knew the players.  He was enthusiastic. And he was star struck. He was definitely a Survivor  fan.  <br/>That's Jeff Probst! He's just standing there!  <br/>Probst: Erik, you're a freak.  <br/>I'm a huge fan of Survivor, since the beginning, when the  first one, Borneo, came out.  <br/>Couple more steps and you're there. Good job, Dude. Erik,  he's like a wide-eyed kid in a candy store.  <br/>Oh, baby.  <br/>Oh, that is sad. Something's wrong with that boy.  <br/>I want to give individual immunity to Natalie.  <br/>You officially go down as the dumbest survivor ever.  <br/>Probst: Erik, the tribe has spoken. [ cheering and  applause] So, Erik, what was your initial reaction when you found out you  were going to be on the show? Because you've been watching... I think we said  during the season, you've been watching since you're 14.  <br/>Yeah, I lost it. I mean, this is crazy. This is freaking  crazy. Right now I'm in... I haven't ever left my small town. I live in  Pinckney, Michigan. It's the middle of nowhere, pretty much. And I never  thought in a million years... I know how many people apply for the show. I  know how many people are crazy about this show. And I didn't think I had a  chance to be on. And then someone calls me up and says, "Hey, you're  freaking hilarious. We want to talk to you. We want to see you." I was  ecstatic. I mean, I can't...  <br/>Probst: What's the reaction been in your hometown?  <br/>It's been awesome. I mean, everybody knows me because I  have this big, dumb hair on my head. And they see me, and they're running up  to me. They're like, "I love you on that show. You're so funny."  Whatever. And I'm like... it's crazy. I've never done this before. I've never  experienced something like that.  <br/>Probst: The tribal council where you gave up your  immunity, I said at the end that's what you call a life lesson. Would you  agree? Was that a life lesson for you?  <br/>I would totally agree with that. I mean, it taught me a  lot of different things, looking down the line, looking around. [ laughter]  At first... I mean, when it happened, at first I was like, "Oh, my God,  you're dumb. You're real dumb." But when you think about it, I mean, the  end game is pretty crazy, and I didn't expect the social part of this game. I  didn't expect to make friends with these people, and I never treated people  in that way before, in the way that this game demands, in the way that you  need to use people like pieces to help you move further. And I saw everybody  here as a friend instead of a competitor, instead of an enemy.  <br/>Probst: So now that you've seen it all play out and you've  had time to think about it, regret that move?  <br/>Initially, yeah, that was real dumb. That was way dumb,  like off-thecharts dumb. But when I see what you had to do to make it  further, there's part of me that says I'm not that guy. I don't think I can  do that. I mean, I don't have that within my being to treat people the way  that needs to be treated to win this game. I mean, certain morals come into  play with that. play with that. [ cheering and applause] [ cheering and  applause]  <br/>Probst: James, I want to get you involved on something now  that involves... that involves Erik and Jason and Ozzy. We had three...  within a few weeks, three of the craziest moves we've ever seen. Of the  three, since you are somewhat of an expert on dumb moves...  <br/>Aw!  <br/>Aw, James.  <br/>Probst: Is that not fair?  <br/>Yes, sir.  <br/>Probst: Of Jason, Ozzy, and Erik, who made the dumbest  move?  <br/>You know, Jason and Ozzy were kind of blindsided. I mean,  that's part of the game. It happens. My good buddy here, Erik, I mean, the  girls were in the boat. They were cruising along. He was on the side of the  boat with a life vest on. He had it. All he had to do was float along. He  took the vest off, the life vest off, and handed it to the ones in the boat.  And I was like, "Wow!" [ applause] Seriously! Thank you. You, boy.  [ laughter]  <br/>Probst: All right, with that, James, I think then... would  the audience agree with that? [ cheering and applause] Okay. Erik, we adore  you, and you will forever be a part of Survivor history. James, go ahead and  take that imaginary crown off your head and just hand it to Erik. [ applause]  You're a good sport, Erik. Up next, it was one of our toughest seasons ever.  Three people were forced out of the game. We will hear from Jonathan, Kathy,  and James. Plus, you know about one Survivorlove affair, but there's another  one that you don't know about. Taking us to our break, Survivor composers  Russ Landau and David composers Russ Landau and David Vanacore.  Vanacore.  <br/>Come on, Erik!  <br/>Probst: Erik going back out  <br/>Probst: Erik going back out and takes a hard hit! and  takes a hard hit! Oh! Oh!  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Ah!  <br/>Oh!  <br/>I want them to come and get a boat and take me away.  <br/>Probst: Ami's hurt. Penner has a busted up knee. Parvati  has a busted up lip. An absolute wipeout for the favorites.  <br/>Infection that goes into your bloodstream is potentially  fatal.  <br/>Ah!  <br/>Ah! [ cheering and applause] [ cheering and  applause]  <br/>Probst: All right, let's get some updates. Penner, how's  the leg?  <br/>The leg is much better, still a little sore. I got nice  honking scar. But other than that, it's going to be okay.  <br/>Probst: Why is this game so hard?  <br/>First I got to say hi to my mom, who wound up in the  hospital today. Sorry. Happy Mother's Day, Mom. I'm sorry you're watching  from there. I love you. Feel better. [ applause] The game is hard... the  hardest thing, for me, about the game is every day you're either getting  fired or you're firing somebody, which is something that most people go  through once, twice, three times in their life. But every day you got to be  prepared, like, "I'm going to fire your ass, or somebody is going to  look for me and get rid of me." It's betray or be betrayed. It's tough,  painful.  <br/>Probst: James, what's the update on the finger?  <br/>The finger is all right. I had a lot of therapy and... but  yeah, a lot of antibiotics, three times a day for seven days. It was kind of  rough. But it was cool.  <br/>Probst: Last time we did this reunion show, we talked to  you about life at the cemetery, and you told us about this mother/daughter  who came up in the midst of grieving and how you kind of turned their day  around. Any similar stories happen since that season?  <br/>Yes, sir. I mean... [ laughter] My dad and I were working.  You know, we had a couple funerals. We were trying to get everything squared  away, and this lady was walking outside. And a few more people started  walking outside. And the next thing you know, there's, like, 50 people  standing there, and they're all just looking at me. [ laughter] And it's kind  of... I don't know. It's a good thing, because I like making people feel  good. So I'll pretty much do anything to have somebody smile. So this lady  was, like, kind of tearing up. She said, "My mom loved your abs." [  laughter] "And it would be so nice if you'd take off your shirt and, you  know, let me see your abs, take a picture."  <br/>I love your abs! [ laughter]  <br/>Thank you. So... [ cheering] Yeah.  <br/>Probst: So you took off your shirt and took a  picture.  <br/>Yeah, pretty much. I had to take off my shirt, and she's  taking pictures, like, smiling. My dad's sitting there looking at me like,  "What's going on?" And she's taken them. She's so... she was so  happy, though.  <br/>Probst: James, always making people happy. [ laughter and  applause] Speaking of your dad, we got a chance to meet him on the show. How  is your dad taking all this?  <br/>My dad is enjoying it.  <br/>Probst: There he is.  <br/>He's having the best time ever. I mean, he's such... you  know, my dad's a sweetheart. And they've been having blogs about him, and  he's been checking up. He's the man. They think he's cute. [ laughter] He's  taking my role. I mean, he can have it. He's my dad. [ applause]  <br/>Probst: Now, Kathy, you had a rough go out there. You were...  you were a huge fan. You applied... people probably don't know, you applied  to the show five times.  <br/>And called the last two, because those tapes are  expensive.  <br/>Probst: You finally get on. Yeah, you finally get on, and  what happened? What was going on out there?  <br/>It just was an immediate separation. I mean, the people  bringing us in on the boats, I could tell the natives were, you know, backing  away from me. I'm like, "What? Do I spell?" I couldn't... you know.  It just was so isolating, and you know, us three-- Chet, Tracy, myself-- we  were kind of ostracized, and I couldn't figure out why. And it just got so  hard. And the weather and never being dry and the rats crawling on you and  biting you and the bugs biting you and the raw, giant chewy clam lips that I  swear to God I never want to see again, you know, it beat me down. Mentally,  I snapped. Cuckoo.  <br/>Probst: Well, I got to say, Kathy, that, you know, I've  seen people quit on this show that I kind of felt like were quitting just  because they'd had enough. I got to give you credit. You endured a lot out  there. You were struggling for long time.  <br/>A long time.  <br/>Probst: You finally had enough. So I hope you're proud of  how you did. I know you gave it your all.  <br/>I did, I did. Thank you. [ applause]  <br/>Probst: It wasn't tough for everybody out there, though.  It was very clear from the start that Ozzy and Amanda were forming a  different kind of alliance.  <br/>I've always thought Ozzy was really, really cute. So it's  kind of like a couply alliance. Freaky?  <br/>Amanda wrestle a four-foot shark by herself. I mean,  that's pretty attractive to a guy like me. Amanda, I honestly feel like I  started to fall in love with you. [ cheering and applause]  <br/>Probst: So let's get an update. Ozzy, what's going on with  this love affair? Is it still on?  <br/>Well, I mean, Jeff, you know how these Survivorgirls are.  [ laughter] I... [ audience groaning] And since... and since then, it's been  kind of tough, because I've lost my job waiting tables. I'm too popular, so I  got to clean the toilets now, and I can't provide for her like I can out on  the island, so... you know.  <br/>He's joking, by the way.  <br/>Probst: Amanda, clear this up for me. Are you guys still  together?  <br/>Yeah, we're still together.  <br/>Probst: Yeah?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Probst: All right. [ cheering and applause]  <br/>He's not cleaning toilets.  <br/>Probst: There's actually one other love story. I talked  about the one we know about, you guys, and we're glad to hear you're  together. Mary, in the back row, another Survivorlove story. Give us the  lowdown.  <br/>Yeah. Well, it's been a good year. I got to play  Survivor,and I fell in love. I met Ryan from Survivor: Pearl Islandsthanks to  Jonny after the show wrapped. And in December, we had our first date, and  three days later, he asked me to marry him. The rest is history. [ applause]  Baby, I love you!  <br/>Probst: Congratulations.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Probst: All right, up next, we have one more love story.  Jonny Fairplay-- he met a model and had a baby. What? Plus, somebody here is  going to pocket a lot of extra cash when we come back. Sprint is awarding  $100,000 to the Sprint player of the season. Stay with us. Stay with us. [  applause] [ applause] [ applause] [ cheering and applause] [ cheering and  applause]  <br/>Probst: Well, since Thursday, viewers have been texting in  their votes for the Sprint player of the season. This is the player that you  guys enjoyed following the most. The votes are in, and I will tell you the  top three votegetters are... Amanda. [ cheering and applause] Ozzy. [  applause] And James. [ cheering and applause] One of you is about to win  $100,000 courtesy of Sprint. The winner of the $100,000, courtesy of Sprint,  goes to James. [ cheering and applause] Back-to-back seasons. Back-to-back  seasons. Congratulations. Congratulations. James, you're shaking your head in  disbelief. It's all those people at the cemetery you're making happy. They're  just paying you back, man.  <br/>Man, thank you all.  <br/>Probst: All right, I got to check in with a few more  people. Congratulations, James.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Probst: Nice pocket change. [ cheering and applause] Jonny  Fairplay, up in the corner, you know, I don't really care to talk about you  on Survivor. We invited you back, you did what you did, boom, we're done.  What I am interested in is you found love.  <br/>Yeah. I'm one of the luckiest guys on the planet. I got my  fiancÃ    e, Michelle Deighton from America's Next Top Model. And I  have the...  <br/>Probst: Look at that beautiful baby. [ cheering and  applause]  <br/>I got the most perfect little girl on the planet. Her name  is Piper Addison Fairplay. And it's incredible. I mean, like, I got the hug from  you leaving tribal council. If you gave Piper a hug for me, that'd be pretty  big in my book, Jeff, so...  <br/>Probst: Well, Fairplay, we're very happy for you. It's  nice to see you can create something so beautiful. It really is. We wish you  well. [ applause] Well, one of my favorite Survivorcouples ever, I got to  say, is Joel and Chet. [ applause] And they teamed up for a classic  Survivormoment that we got to Survivormoment that we got to take a look at  one more time. take a look at one more time.  <br/>Probst: That's it. [ cheering and applause] So, Joel, you  were responsible, yourself, Joel, for a couple of blindsides.  <br/>What are you talking about?  <br/>Probst: Then you get blindsided. What I want to know is  which is tougher to go back to the guys in the firehouse, the fact that you  got blindsided or the fact that Chet lasted longer than you? [ cheering and  applause]  <br/>I... it's a very good edit. I'll say that.  <br/>Probst: Well, the edit speaks for itself. Chet is two  people to your left. [ laughter] Did you have a good time on the show?  <br/>I had a good time on the show. Yeah, I haven't had any  issues with any of the guys at the firehouse. That's their favorite scene  too.  <br/>Probst: Yeah. [ laughter] No, it's great. And, Chet, I  have to say, with all due respect to you, I gave you a hard time out  there.  <br/>You did, you did.  <br/>Probst: I did. And yet you outlasted a lot of people in  this game.  <br/>I did. Well, I mean, every tribal council I was at-- and  lord knows I was at a lot of them-- I mean, you really drilled into me that I  was probably the oldest person there. I was always the weakest person  there.  <br/>Probst: I said that.  <br/>And you always praised the athletic agility/strength  people, and I outlasted them. So maybe when it comes right down to it, maybe  the whole secret is just reading the little Survivormanual just a little bit  closer than everybody did.  <br/>Probst: Well said.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Probst: Tracy, underrated in this game, I think, and I  heard that from a lot of people who watched the show. You got off to a bad  start, just the way the numbers fell in the group. What advice would you give  to somebody who plays this game that finds themself in a similar situation?  Is there anything you could have done differently?  <br/>I'd like to say no. I think I tried everything I could  possibly try. I begged. I mean, I pleaded with Cirie till the last breath.  She wouldn't budge, but...  <br/>Probst: So sometimes, if you get off to a bad  start...  <br/>Yeah. I mean, well, you know, the thing about Survivoris  when you elect to go on this... you know, this adventure, you own it. And so  you got to own it. And as bad as you don't like it, you got to own it, and  you can't complain about what could have been better for you. It's changing,  and you got to suck it up and take it, so...  <br/>Probst: Nicely said. Mikey B., I saved you for last  because I know that this being Mother's Day and that one of the things you  wanted was to have your mom here with you, because she was so proud that you  were on the show, she isn't here with us tonight. Tell us what happened and  tell us how you're doing.  <br/>Um, she basically got sick right around the time where I  was leaving, and I didn't know how severe it was because she didn't want me  to worry about her when I was on the island. But she passed away last month.  And you know, she's... she's still here in spirit, and you know, she always  taught us that God has a perfect plan and that that plan never fails and to  celebrate death and move on. And I believe she's here. Her sisters are here  representing her, and I think she's watching over us. [ applause] And happy  Mother's Day, Mama. I love you.  <br/>Probst: And we want to wish all of the moms out there a  happy Mother's Day, including our own Audrey Roche, a part of our  Survivorfamily who couldn't be here tonight. Up next, we're going to show you  where Survivoris going next. where Survivoris going next. We'll be right  back. We'll be right back.  <br/>Probst: Welcome back.
