<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," at the Kama  tribe, the returning players were on the outs. <br/>Someone needs to win this game. <br/>I don't want the play with returners, because they've had  their chance. <br/>Jeff: At the Manu tribe, Reem and Wendy were isolating  themselves. <br/>Those might be the three we were wanting to vote out any  way. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council Reem dug her own grave. <br/>My name got thrown out today. I'm pissed off. <br/>But that is part of this game. <br/>I'm not done. Whatever. <br/>Jeff: And was first person voted out. <br/>Jeff: Reem, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Jeff: And the first person to face a new twist. <br/>What? <br/>Jeff: Go home or grab the torch and go to the Edge of  Extinction. <br/>I have no idea where I am. And I still don't know what's going on. But they don't know I'm here. Like I hope to show my face again and be like, look what just  happened. You know, I would love that. But again, like what do I have to go through for this second  chance? This is the Edge of Extinction. You will have to work hard for everything. When fear or loneliness sets in, you must find the resolve to  overcome. If at any point you wish to end your adventure, raise the sail  and a boat will pick you up. What? There's no time line on this? Edge of Extinction. What does that mean? I'm stranded. Now I got nothing better to do but analyze why I got voted off. I'm so disappointed. Like why didn't I notice I was seeming naggy. I just didn't want them to be hurt. Instead I blew my chance. I just don't want to embarrass my kids. There has to be a good reason to leave them. I'm not a quitter though, man, you know? I'm not a quitter. I'm not a quitter. I do not want to disappoint my family. That's what's keeping me from raising that damn sail. That's what's keeping me from raising that damn sail. <br/>This is funny. <br/>How are your hands? <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Looking like an old lady. <br/>By my pedicure still looks great. <br/>How are you feeling about last night? Several people tried to get you to come over, right? <br/>I understand Reem was dead in the water, but I didn't want  to side with Kelley. Kelley has played two times before. We've seen her game play. We know how she plays. It's not her first rodeo, and if you guys keep going with the numbers,  they will control the game. At tribal council, my stRongest ally Reem was voted out. Now I feel like I'm the next in line. I blame Kelley. She's the ringleader. It makes me so angry. Kelley has played two times before this. For me, she's had her shot. Two times you can't do it, then you can't do it. Don't try to mess up first-time players' games. She has this personality where she tries to become your friend. A lot of people are eating that up. Not I. I can see right through that. Look over there. She's already working her magic. <br/>Right, right. <br/>I just feel like you guys have the power to get her out. <br/>Listen, I think your concerns are totally legitimate. <br/>Yeah. <br/>But to be honest, I don't think this part of the camp  right now is a good time for this conversation. <br/>David, the other second-chance player, I think it's  resonating in him, but right now he's playing more of a go-with-the-flow kind  of game. I understand that. But I think he's with me. So if Rick and David are on board with it, then I just need one  more vote. <br/>We have to watch now. <br/>100%. We have to be really, really, really careful. <br/>We have to keep close tabs on Wendy now. She'll be idol hunting. <br/>I completely understand Wendy's position, because I've  been there. I have been on the bottom. I have been the target. I know exactly how it feels. She's trying to get something going, and having someone in camp  who is freaking out and knows they're on the bottom is very dangerous. <br/>I think she's trying to swap and take us out. <br/>Liability. <br/>She's probably going to look for an idol. How do you feel about going out as a group? Doesn't matter who gets it. <br/>Oh, an open idol hunt? <br/>Yeah. <br/>We can't let Wendy find the idol. I mean, everyone else worked with me at the last tribal, and I'm  getting the sense they want to continue to work with me. But any time your name is thrown out there, it's like what, if  because sometimes these things catch fire some at this point it's Wendy on  this side and me on this side, and we're basically going to battle, and one  of us is going to win the war. <br/>We need a song and a dance. <br/>You have choreography? <br/>For the next immunity challenge -- come Kama, Kama, Kama. You bend over in fRont of me. [laughter] Kama. <br/>Morale I think is a huge reason why we're doing well in  this game right now, why we won the other day. You have to be in a positive place. We need to feel bonded, and for us, dancing has become our  thing. K-a-m-a, Kama, Kama, Kama. To the fRont. It's pump, pump, pump, and Kama. <br/>I hate kum ba yah Survivor, but it's the worst. I want to blend in with everyone else. I like going to tribal first when I play "Survivor,"  because you see immediately where the lines are. You know how to work with it. When it's consume "Kumbaya" and is, I just won first  challenge, you don't know what the hell is going on. <br/>I haven't really talked to anyone. How are you guys feeling about returning in general? <br/>I'm glad that you guys are here. <br/>But like moving forward, is that something that interests  you? <br/>Yeah, yeah. Everyone's going to be scared of Joe the further along we get,  but that time is nowhere near here, and things can change before them. <br/>Cool. <br/>I'm finding it frustrating that these newbies aren't being  forthcoming about their perception of returning players. I know Joe and I are under magnifying glass. We're like these ants that people are looking at real hard, and  I'm afraid the sun is going to come and zap us the hell off this camp. <br/>Aubry is clearly trying to make sure she's not first one  out from our tribe, because Aubry approached me and Julia and said, so how do  you feel tact returning players, which is an on-the-spot question to ask,  like what can I possibly say? Yeah, we want you guys gone. <br/>They've had their moment to shine. It's our time to have our chance. Aubry said something interesting to me the other day. She grabbed my arm and she said, I really like you. <br/>Let me tell you, she said the exact same thing to me. She said the exact same thing to her, the exact same thing to Gavin. <br/>I heard, I just want to have an open dialogue, those key  words. <br/>I like the way you think, you remind me of myself. Aubry is going to everyone. I think she's a little panicked. <br/>I have you. We could start to have a dialogue. <br/>I think so. <br/>I just wanted to make sure that we can have a dialogue,  because I feel great with you. <br/>Right. <br/>She's like, I really like you. I think you're a good player. You remind me of patriots. <br/>I think you're cool. Some of the things you remind me, that's funny. You just remind me of me a lot. I think you play like I do. We see similar things. Okay. Same wavelength. <br/>She's doing her best to pull somebody in with her. She's doing a great job at her. She might have to go. <br/>Did you check this? <br/>No. <br/>There were so many little crevices up here. <br/>Get a stick. It usually won't be like that far down. <br/>I almost feel like Kelley the we should all look for an  idol together could be cover. <br/>Because she already has it? <br/>Let's go over here. <br/>I really like Kelley. I feel good working about her with a big group, but I don't have  anything with her. <br/>We shouldn't say anything to Wendy that we're concrete  doing it. But it's possible that it is now, you know? Wendy feels like her back is against the wall because she lost  her only ally, which was Reem. She's worried she could be next to go. So Wendy's pitch is that we should get rid of Wentworth. The funny thing is I know that Kelley Wentworth is not going to  let me get too deep into this game. I know she wants to cut me soon. She's a really smart player, and she's going to do everything  she can to eliminate threats. <br/>What are you guys doing? I just need to know if you guys are working with me or with  them? <br/>Listen, we agree that Kelley's a huge threat. <br/>I'm just saying, like I'm a number you can use, and we  have the same end game. <br/>What would our numbers be? <br/>You, you, me, Keith and war dog. I was loyal to Reem even if it affected my game. <br/>This is what you want in this game, this is not on deaf ears. Orchestrating a blind side is very delicate. You have to be so careful about who you let know about it. I mean, Keith seems to be tight with Wendy, but trying the pull  in war dog, that makes me very nervous, because he doesn't like to talk tract  until it's absolutely necessary. But at the same time, Wendy's loyalty and trust could be worth  more than money in this game. <br/>She wouldn't be a bad person  Oh, no. She's so loyal. I think that's a great thing to have in our pocket. I don't want to shut this down at all. But seriously, dude, I trusted you in this game more than I  trust anybody else. <br/>I'm with you. Like I talk more game with you than anybody by far. <br/>Okay. Cool. <br/>I feel much more comfortable with you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm in. <br/>Okay. <br/>Good, man, great. Love it. <br/>My strategy coming into this game is get with big guys and  kind of slip through, and I think David might be my guy. We're two peas in a pod. I think we see the world the same way. We see the game the same way. I'm going to use my sense of humor and try to get in tight with  him. <br/>I would be fine going all the way to the end with you. I shouldn't even be telling you, this but you could like string  me along and cut my throat at four or five, whatever. I'm just telling you --  Let's shake on that I'll cut your throat at four. [laughter] is that cool? <br/>Rick's hystErical. I love the guy. He's so much fun to be around. Rick is honestly the person I trust most in this game. Also he's very smart and strategic, and that could be really  great for my game. So I'm going to try to keep Rick around for as long as possible. <br/>There is an idol here. <br/>Without a doubt. <br/>I think we can be more aggressive looking for the idol. <br/>We need the find it. <br/>Advantages and idols are in everyone's mind. I'm the the biggest fan here. I've been wanting to do this for so dang long. As a fan watching through the tv, I'm thinking how in the heck  do these people find this stuff. And it's the same for me now. It's just shooting in the dark. You truly have no idea where it's at. Geographically the space is huge. We have no idea how the idols are hidden or if there's clues or  markings. And the jungle is so thick that you really have to search for an  extended period of time. And time away from the tribe is suspicious. <br/>Do you even think there are idols out here? <br/>Of course there are. Recently I see some men disappearing, and they're gone for a  long time. Whether they're going off alone or they're going off in pairs,  it's quite obvious there's a lot of idol searching going on. <br/>I'm sure they're looking for idols. Everybody should be looking for idols. Why aren't I looking for idols? Why do the men always find the idols? <br/>Okay. We need to be babysitting more. <br/>No, we need to be looking. I wish I knew what was going on with idols and advantages. I'm sure people have started looking, but I have no idea how you  would even begin to start looking for something. I mean, it's a big place, and everything is unique in its own  way, but also exactly the same. They're all trees that look a little funky. Where do you begin. <br/>This is what I was saying with men versus women. We're sitting here chitchatting. We could be looking for an idol right now. <br/>It's interesting to me that the women and men do fall into  these preconceived roles. I don't know if it's about living this primitive lifestyle where  the men were the gatherers and hunters -- no, the women were the gatherers. I don't know. I think it's my own personal issue that I have to start to  figure out. I'm not a sneaky person. And it feels sneaky to me to kind of slither off searching for  idols. <br/>There's a lot of people looking for the idol. The odds of you finding it are slim, but ever since I was a kid,  finding an idol was kind of on my "Survivor" bucket list, because  my two favorite female players were parvity and Kelley Wentworth. They weren't just girls that rode coattails. They were bad asses, especially Kelley Wentworth. Kelley found two immunity idols in her season. An she used them brilliantly. <br/>All right, baby. <br/>And so I always wanted to find an idol. And this is "Survivor." you can find an idol anywhere. I see a tree that's kind of fallen over. And I'm thinking, if I was an immunity idol, I would be hiding  in there. I can't believe I pull out my beautiful immunity idol package. "You have found a hidden immunity idol." I feel  ecstatic. Oh, my God, I found an immunity idol. Finding it on the same tribe as one of my role models makes it  astRonomically more exciting. I just have to hide it, because I am 100% keeping it to myself. I'm very tight with Kelley, but I'm definitely not telling her. I'm glad I have it and she doesn't. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. Kama getting your first look at the new Manu tribe. Reem voted out at first tribal council. All right. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: First things first, got the take back if idol. <br/>No. <br/>Jeff: Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, both tribes will swim out to a cage. You have to get up and over the cage. You'll then untie a very long and very heavy snake. Then you have to get the snake out of the cage and back to  shore. You'll place it in the cradle. You'll untie a series of "Not the newses," releasing  numbered tiles. Nose tiles will help you solve the combination lock. That lock will releasing a rings. You'll then attempt to land those rings on a series of targets. The first tribe to spell "Immunity" wins immunity. In addition you're playing for reward. <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Today you have a choice. You can choose between spices plus a few fives and a cutting  board, or if you're willing to do a little work, a dee -- deluxe Survivor  fishing kit, everything you need to catch fish if you're willing to put in  the work and think you can pull it off. Losers, tribal council, where somebody will be the second person  voted out of "Survivor: Edge of Extinction." Aubry, you've done  this challenge before. <br/>Yes, I have. <br/>Jeff: How did it go? <br/>That is one heavy snake? <br/>And the result? <br/>. <br/>Jeff: Lost. See if you can change that story today. Kama, one extra person. Sitting somebody out. Who is it going to be? <br/>I am. <br/>Jeff: All right, Julie, take a spot on the sit-out bench. Everybody else take a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right. Here we go, for immunity and reward, sure rivers ready? Go! Everybody in the water. Got to get to that cage as fast as you can. Kama moving through the water quickly. Wendy very good in the water. Manu moving much more slowly. Keith struggling in the water like he did in the marooning, and  that's forcing tribe mates to stay back to help him. Kama getting up and over. Manu now working up and over. Everybody for Kama is at the cage. Manu still working to get Keith to the cage. <br/>Keith, come on. <br/>Jeff: You cannot start working. Everybody has to get over. There are four sets of knots that will release that snake. Once you have the snake free, you have to get it up and out of  the cage. <br/>Let's go, guys. <br/>Keith, jump over. <br/>Jeff: Keith still taking a lot of time to get over. Now you can start untying. Kama has their snake free. Kama now trying to get up and over that cage and start pulling  that snake. That snake weighs a lot. Kama now with plan. Aurora is over first. <br/>Keep going. Get it up. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Jeff: Manu has their snake free. They can start working it out of the cage. <br/>One, two, three! <br/>Jeff: Eric literally carrying that snake on his back. Kama halfway there now. <br/>We need one of the big guys up here. <br/>Jeff: Manu still stuck in the water, absolutely no  progress made with that snake yet. <br/>Back up! <br/>Jeff: Kama doing a nice job. They've got momentum. The entire tribe is working together now. <br/>Help me, Keith, help me, Keith. <br/>Jeff: You can see Manu struggling. Joe leaves it down. You're good! Kama now has their snake free. Manu now getting some momentum. Suddenly they have more snake coming. There's another big section coming out. Manu trying to get back in this now. It takes all eight tribe members to carry that snake. It is heavy. Manu has three-quarters of their snake out. One last big push will do it. You're good! Up and over. You got to go under. Very the heavy snake now to drag through the sand. Manu has struggled this entire challenge from the get-go, but Manu  is back in this. <br/>Let's get it on the table. <br/>Jeff: You have to get up on that cradle. Everything about this challenge has been hard. But you have to keep digging. Now you can start untying. You're looking for six numbered disks. Manu still fighting. <br/>One, two, three...  One, two, three...  Jeff: All right. You're good. It's going to be Ron solving the combination lock for Kama. Manu now has their snake. You're looking for six disks. Got to get all six. <br/>You got it. <br/>Jeff: There it is. David whipping through these numbers now. Meanwhile, Ron is trying one combination and he's got it. Three people. David still working on that combination lock. Perfect. There we go. David tries another combo. He's got to hook these rings in order spelling  "Immunity." Joe has the first letter for Kama. There it is. David finally involves it. Manu is back in this. Chris tosses. Can he tie it up? And he does. We're tied 1-1. Chris is keeping Manu in this. All the pressure now on the ring throwers. Here comes Eric. <br/>Yes, yes, yes! <br/>Jeff: Eric hooks his second. Chris still firing for Manu. No. Here comes Joe to get back in. <br/>Throw it till you get it, Joe. Joe lands a third ring for Kama. It is 3-1. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Chris now a second one for Manu. It is 3-2. <br/>It's all you, buddy. <br/>Jeff: Chris on and off. <br/>I'm ready for you. <br/>Jeff: Here comes Keith for Manu. Keith struggled early in the water. He would like the make it up right here. Keith just misses. <br/>Good job, Keith. Good hustle. <br/>Beautiful, beautiful. <br/>Jeff: Eric nails the fourth for Kama. It is 4-2 now. Keith tosses. Way short. <br/>That's all right. Keith. <br/>Yes, buddy? Ierk has a fifth for Kama. Kama closing in on it now. <br/>Jeff: Keith would like the close the gap. Can't get it done. <br/>You know what you got to do. <br/>Jeff: Chris back in. Chris is the only one who has had any success. Chris hits the third for Manu. Joe hits the sixth one. Kama is starting to close in. Chris has got to pick up the pace. Chris snags the fourth ring, keeping Manu in it. Joe hooks the seventh ring. Kama has one left. Here comes Eric to close it out. Chris trying to stay in it. Just misses. Eric could win it right here for Kama. And he does! Kama wins immunity sending Manu back the tribal council. <br/>Kama, Kama, Kama, Kama. Whew! <br/>Jeff: Kama back-to-back challenge wins. [applause] once again nobody going home from your tribe. In addition, you have a choice of reward. What are you going to do? <br/>Well, we're going to do the fishing gear. <br/>Fishing gear will be waiting for you back at camp. No tribal council back at camp. Nice work. All right, Manu, for the second time this season, somebody from  your tribe will be voted out. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>Losing our second challenge definitely is deflating. It hurts. But now I'm thinking maybe this is not a bitheir equation of  just Wentworth or Wendy even though they're going to war with each other. Maybe there's plan "C." Keith is a liability in  challenges. Maybe a new game plan has to be enacted. Well, wasn't for a lack of trying. <br/>Good job. Amazing. <br/>You got four letters on your own. <br/>Nothing you could have done. Nothing you could have done. That's all right. <br/>Sorry. <br/>You have nothing to apologize for. <br/>The challenge was a disaster. My swimming was bad. Chris had to help me a lot. And then the rings toss, I just look home. So it did not go as landed. Before we lost 24 challenge, I was sure that Wendy was going  home, but now I'm thinking that, you know, my name could be on the chopping  block, so this could be my last day here playing Survivor. <br/>So what do you think? After the challenge I'm thinking Keith is the one to go now. He's a liability. At this point we're down to numbers. We can't lose again. We need strength. And Keith is not stRong in challenges. He's killing us. So all these things add up. I'm thinking to myself, how is Keith in this game helping the Wardog  out. The answer is he's not. I don't think --  They're coming up. I knew this would happen. Wardog is leading the charge to vote out Keith. It's stupid. I don't know what he's thinking. Yeah, he's failed miserably, but he's not a threat to anybody,  whereas windy wants to get me out. So I am not happy. <br/>I think it's got to be Keith. He's a complete liability in challenges. Wendy is diving down. She's a good swimmer. She's as tough as any of those females. What are you doing? Okay. <br/>I new convinces Wardog to vote out Wentworth was going to  be difficult, and sure enough, Wardog is very adamant that Keith is going  home, so now I don't think that I have the five votes I need to get rid of Wentworth. It's like, damn. The they're up there talking about possibly getting Keith out,  because he was a no show. Unfortunately, Keith kind of shot himself in the foot, which  kind of sucks. Because he's a good kid. And I know that this game means a lot to him. <br/>I'm so freakin' sorry, yo. You did beyond freaking amazing. I promise you I tried the swimming thing. I don't know what it was. All I can tell you is that I promise you, like no matter at what  point in the game we are new york I'm never turning my back on you, because  you have helped me way too much. Literally never, like I promise you, like ever, like at no point  in the game. <br/>Honestly, I don't want Keith to go, because Keith has  specifically told me, I'm in with you until the end. I'm going to stay loyal to you before anyone else. That's not the top of player you vote out. <br/>Real quick, is it better to keep Keith around? <br/>What do you mean? <br/>Win or not win? <br/>Let's say we take out Kelley. <br/>I think it's something serious to think about, because I  don't know how many opportunities in an upcoming within we would have. <br/>Exactly. <br/>We're thinking the same thing, my friend. <br/>Holy crap, we might still be able to take out Wentworth,  and the best part of that is Chris actually came up with the idea. Chris came to me. We both think this is the prime time for a blind side. This is huge. <br/>So Chris came up to me at the water hole and was asking  about is Keith the right person to get out next. What about Kelley? <br/>Are you serious? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, my God. This is great. Yes! The answer is yes. <br/>If we could get him on board, you and I, Wendy. <br/>We're on board. That's four. We only need Keith. <br/>Yes, best news of the day. This is so exciting. I feel like we've been handed this gift. It's Christmas, because I'm all about blind siding Wentworth. I think that's a great idea. This tribe is not big enough for two returning players. So I want to take her out before she comes after me. And as long as everyone is on board with this plan, it's almost  going to happen on its own. <br/>Okay. Chris has approached us about getting rid of Kelley. <br/>Oh, my God. I'm down. I'm completely down. Completely down. <br/>I'm excited. It's hard in my position. This is exactly what I wanted. They have the numbers to vote out Kelley. I have new life. <br/>Okay. We need to think through this. You and me. But there's been some discussions about now would be a really  good time to make a move on Wentworth because Wentworth is one of those  players, she's only going to use us until she doesn't need us anymore. <br/>Correct. <br/>She's good enough to know that. <br/>But here's the thing. It's like a tribe swap, we're talking about a scenario in che we  need a couple because we'll be down on numbers, and I think Wentworth might  be a bigger target than you and me. <br/>Yeah. <br/>She might be our shield. That's our thing. I don't trust Wentworth one bit, but I feel like we all have a  similar aligned goals right now. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Chris is throwing cold water on my idea. He wants to take out Wentworth, but I think that's very  short-sighted. <br/>She's a returning player. She's a threat. She plays the game hard. She finished fourth place last time. She's a gamer. But that means she has a bigger target on her back than I do. That's a great reason to keep her around. Bring a goat to the end and take the spot away from them? What do you think? <br/>I mean, I think if we could take out Wentworth first, we  take out Keith next. <br/>Well, we can change it. It's not too late to go another direction. I want the plan to be my plan, but I want everybody else to feel  like it's their plan, too. I don't want them looking at me like I'm trying to call the  shots. That will just get me into trouble. So Chris and myself, we got to make a decision, but if we are  going to take out Wentworth, this is the vote. <br/>I'm trusting my life with you guys tonight. <br/>I know. <br/>People are acting very strange. It's making me nervous. There has been a shift. And I'm like, if I were in their shoe, what would I do. There is no question, I would vote me out. It's not like these people know each other's game, burr they do  know mine. <br/>I don't know who is telling the truth and who is not. I've been in this position before, and both times I was blind  sided. I trust Lauren, but not these other people. So my heart is beating very fast right now. I feel like it is going to be deeãjaaã vu, and if they take me  o before Keith, I'm going to be so pissed off. So last tribal, seems pretty clear Reem was the person you  wanted out, but Wendy, you got votes, as well. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Are you concerned you might get votes again the un? <br/>Yeah, I feel like the first vote establishes where you  are. So considering I wasn't with them for the first vote, maybe I'll  get votes for the second one. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth, you also received a vote. Is it unnerving to get a vote at the first tribal? <br/>Yeah did I want to see my name, no, because that means  that your name is coming up. <br/>Jeff, we all knew who voted for Wentworth, and it was Reem,  but her name is still out there for sure. I mean, she's --  Thanks, kevin. <br/>I'm not telling you anything you don't know. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth, kevin pipes in, just so you know, your  name is still out there. But as a returning player, is that to be expected. <br/>Yeah, I've played before. People can use that as an asset or a negative. <br/>Jeff: What is the asset of a returning player? <br/>I think one asset is that I'm always going to be a shield. I'm always going to be a bigger target than most of these  people, especially in the early game when people are just trying to figure  out who to get rid of. I also think that I am a stRong tribe member as far as like  winning, like we need to win. We need numbers right now. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, you're nodding. That rings true to you? <br/>Oh, my gosh, we can't lose again, ever again. It sucks, it's worst feeling in the world. I think if we can have a stRong tribe, that would be the best  move. <br/>Jeff: Keith, the talk seems to be centering around keeping  the tribe stRong. Does that concern you in because no matter how you look at it,  your challenge performance was a disaster. <br/>That's true, but at the same time, your longevity in this  game will not depend on ring toss. One clear-cut rout keeping the tribe stRong, you could still be  going to the merge with numbers, and you have someone that flips. It will depend on the relationships you wild. <br/>Jeff: Is it fair to keep the tribe stRong and Keith did  not get it con and he should go home, it's easy? <br/>It makes a lot of sense. You're balancing staying stRong as a tribe, but also staying stRong  as a voting unit, people you can trust. This is such a crucial part of the game strategically. And today it was even more crystal clear, like, all right, we  got to figure some things out. <br/>Jeff: Kevin, two big ideas Chris just shared, don't want  to lose again, which is challenge performance. And trust. Loyalty. <br/>A good point. And I think last tribal loyalty, performance, then you lose  again, and all of a sudden performance is looking pretty important. Maybe a little strength can go a long way. <br/>Is Wardog, is there a lot of talking at camp? Are we self-now? Is that game on, blind sides will be coming? <br/>I think there is a lot of talking going on. There's a lot of different ideas floating around. And it's possible somebody does get blind sided tonight. <br/>Jeff: So where is your gauge on how well you think you can  read these other people? <br/>I will know tonight if my gauge is stRong or not. Those votes get read, I'll know where I stand on this tribe. <br/>Jeff: David, what's your take? Do you think tonight's vote will be a blind side? <br/>I really believe tonight will absolutely be a blind side. I feel like I could write down how everyone is going to vote,  and if it doesn't go that way, I think the blind side will be on me. <br/>Jeff: Keith, do you think it's going to be a bloind side? <br/>I think everybody has worked the game to their advantage  to make sure they're not the ones going home, so I think everyone thinks  they're not going home, so, yes, I do think there is going to be a blind  side. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth, you can't put it any better than, that  everybody has talked to everybody and is certain they're right, which means  it can only be another blind side. <br/>Yeah, you have the conversations you have and you hope the  vote sticks. Some people here didn't work out for them this time. <br/>Who doesn't want to check blind side off their list. Notch the tree, drink from the well, blind side. <br/>I think you're fine. I got pat on the shoulder. <br/>Jeff: Wardog, what Gavin said is just being honest. <br/>I think every move you make sure a rational decision. We want our cake and we want to eat it to. Unless I'm dealing with the seven best liars in the world, with  the choice today, we can make that happen. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. David, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. First vote, Kelley. Keith. Wendy. That's one vote Wentworth, one vote Keith, one vote Wendy. Keith. That's two votes Keith. Keith. <br/>For real? <br/>Jeff: That's three votes Keith, one vote Wentworth, one  vote Wendy. Second person voted out of "Survivor: Edge of Extinction,"  Keith. That's four, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Wow, wow, wow. Y'all think you're still going to win challenges? <br/>Jeff: Keith, the tribe has spoken. <br/>God. Dang, dang, dang. Dang it. Dang it. Dang. You have a decision to make. If you want a chance to get back in the game, take the torch and  get in the boat. If you do not want the play anymore, follow this path and your  adventure will end. Oh, my God. Come on. Oh, God. Come on, God. Oh, my God, come on, God. Come on, God. Come on. Come on, God, come on. Come on. Come on, God. Come on, God. Come on, jesus.

Nobody wants to talk us to. <br/>Jeff: You'll need a pack mentality. <br/>Kill or be killed. <br/>Jeff: Or catch a break. <br/>I'm worried because I've never broken anything. I don't know. <br/>I am like so down in the dumps. I've been here for three freakin' days. And I've eaten maybe a bite or two of coconut. I don't know, man. If no one shows up, I maze have the raise that flag.
