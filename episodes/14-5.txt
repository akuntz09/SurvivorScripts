<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor...  You're driving me absolutely insane. <br/>Probst: At Ravu, Rocky blew up at Anthony. <br/>You're getting all, like, sentimental and sensitive. You're a man. Act like one. <br/>They want me out of this game, they're going to have push me off, because  there's no way in hell I'm giving up. <br/>Probst: At the Moto camp, an unspoken alliance of five emerged. <br/>The five musketeers. <br/>From the beginning, there has been a bond between Boo, Alex, Edgar, myself,  and Stacy. All we know is that the five of us get along. <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge...  Lisi, let's go, baby. <br/>Probst: Moto's strategy is starting to work. ...Moto continued to perform well... [ cheering] Moto wins reward! ...intensifying the gap between the wealthy...  Probst: Fish, rice, and a king-sized bed. ...and the destitute. <br/>What happened? <br/>We lost, bro! What do you mean, "What happened?"  Probst: Yau-Man was sent to Exile Island, where he learned the idol was back  at camp. <br/>"It's buried under the highest point of the big cave." I'm quite  sure I know where the idol is. <br/>I can't function like this. <br/>Probst: Moto suffered its first blow...  All right, Gary, I'm going to call in the medical boat now and get you out of  here. <br/>Probst: ...when Gary was forced to leave the game. At the immunity challenge... Ravu has a lot of time to make up. ...Ravu could not change their luck, and Moto once again claimed victory. Motto wins immunity, still undefeated! But a message in a bottle left Moto with a dilemma. <br/>"You must now decide which is more important to you."  Probst: Moto had to choose between giving up immunity or their camp of  comfort. <br/>Jeff, we're keeping our comfort and going to tribal council. <br/>Probst: Back at camp, the alliance of five solidified. <br/>We need to put in our votes and make a decision. <br/>I vote Liliana. <br/>I vote Liliana too. <br/>Probst: At tribal council... Fourth person voted out of Survivor: Fiji...  Wow. <br/>Probst: ...Liliana was blind[1]sided. Liliana, the tribe has spoken. 14 are left. 14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>You guys like it well-done, right? Medium-well, all right. I just came back from Exile Island. The clues to the whereabouts of the immunity idol definitely points to the  fact that it's in our tribal camp area. In fact, it's very specific that it is at the threshold of our cave, where we  are sleeping. It's very frustrating. I sort of know where it is, and I don't know how to get to it. <br/>Earl is the only other person  Earl is the only other person who has been to Exile Island. who has been to Exile Island. <br/>He knows that I know where it is sort of, and I know he knows sort of where  it is. So maybe at some point, we can join forces in finding this join forces in  finding this idol. idol. <br/>He has all the clues, and I only have a couple, but he's only have a couple,  but he's going to need my help. going to need my help. <br/>I like Yau. I just want to build that trust with him, okay? "Yau, you can trust me. I have your back." Just when it comes down to it, me just helping him  get the idol me just helping him get the idol is just a good move. is just a good move. is just a good move. [ theme song playing] [ theme song playing]  We're struggling right now, and all of us are starving. The other camp, they have a shelter, a king-sized mattress, tons of food,  fishing gear. We're still sleeping on palm fronds. We at least got a good water system going. And that's about it. <br/>Yau-Man and I had a little chat about the idol. I mean, he has an idea where it might be, but there's no way for him to look  for it when people are there, because the idol is actually in our little cave. So we got to get people out of there. It's time to go hunting for crab-- crab, snails, anything crab-- crab,  snails, anything you see-- if you want to eat. you see-- if you want to eat. <br/>I'm very excited. I got a chance to dig, I don't know for how long. The problem is I don't know when they will show up. I know it's along the threshold somewhere, right at the entrance of the cave. So logically, if that's true, then it would be right then it would be right  underneath here. underneath here. The problem is the clue definitely says, "Dig deep." That's the  question, how deep do I have to go? And with a machete, it's not And with a machete, it's not easy to dig deep. easy to dig deep. <br/>I took the whole camp out to give Yau a chance to dig for that immunity idol. Hopefully, he goes with what I'm Hopefully, he goes with what I'm trying to  do. trying to do. Now, look at that. Now, look at that. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. <br/>Earl and I decided we were going to hike up, see if we could find some more  fruit or anything edible. And I tell you, we got up to the hill, where you can see 360 degrees, all  around the island. We so rarely get a chance to just take it in and just let ourselves be  astounded and awed by what's around us. It gives you new drive to keep going. In a battle of wills, which this game is, you need every little ounce of  energy you can get to keep you just emotionally going keep you just  emotionally going forward. forward. <br/>The search for the immunity idol is not going very well. Trying to dig with that machete is quite difficult-- to dig deep, at least. At this point, it's going to be At this point, it's going to be very  difficult to get it. very difficult to get it. <br/>Tree mail. <br/>Time to go get our reward, establish our new victory streak. <br/>Oh, pictures. <br/>"Pick two choices for your reward. You win, you'll take it all. If you lose, you'll just take a beating." Toiletries-- I saw toiletries! <br/>Wine, cheese. <br/>Oh, yeah, that one! <br/>Oh! <br/>I say we get the cake and the toiletries. <br/>The toiletries. <br/>Are you going to change your vote? <br/>We keep getting more food, more nourishment. Ravu keeps getting less. They're wasting away. But we have the luxury of them being down and malnourished and us being fat  and happy. Who cares how much luxury? We have so much luxury, it doesn't matter. <br/>I want the chocolate cake. Can we please pick one thing that we need and one thing we want? <br/>Yeah, one thing that we need and something we can eat. <br/>Two things we need, that'd be the best thing, two things that we need. <br/>I'm starving. <br/>Okay, we definitely want... that's why we want fishing gear, to catch fish. We're not on Fantasy Island. I don't want wine and cheese. That doesn't do anything for me. Moto is living in a mansion over there, you know, The Fresh Prince of Bel  Airover there. And we're like, you know, Good Times. You know, we're going to be practical. They should have put a couple of Philly cheese steaks on there. <br/>Don't start with the food game! <br/>Probst: Ravu, come on in! <br/>Probst: Ravu, come on in! Moto, come on in! Moto, come on in! Boo, can't help but notice that you're coming in here chewing on... what was  that, mango? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: Rocky, it's got to burn a little bit. <br/>I mean, look at my eyes. There's fire coming out right now. Laugh it up. It's all right. We'll see what happens. <br/>Probst: Shall we get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, you will square off one on one on a platform. Using large, padded bags, you will battle sumo-style. Your goal: knock the other tribe member off the platform, into the mud. Winner scores a point for their tribe. First tribe to seven wins reward. The winning tribe will send one member from the losing tribe to Exile Island. Let's get to the reward. Ravu, you chose necessity, the same fishing gear that Moto has two sets of  and a pot full of potatoes, absolute essentials if you guys are going to have  any shot in this game. Life is so good for Moto, they chose more luxury: coffee and some toiletries. Winner takes it all. <br/>Keep it up, Dreamz. Keep it up, guy, seriously. Why don't me and you go up there right now? <br/>We could. <br/>Let's do that then. Keep running your mouth. Bring it. Bring it, bro. I'm sick of this guy. Let's go, Jeff. Let's play the game. <br/>Probst: Do we have our first match? Is it Rocky and Dreamz? <br/>That's what it is. <br/>Probst: All right. There's one rule. Each person has to go at least once. <br/>You got to show us what  You got to show us what you're made of, man. you're made of, man. <br/>Probst: Ravu looking for their first win. Moto wants to remain undefeated. Survivors ready? <br/>Let's go, man. <br/>All right, Rock. <br/>Probst: Go. <br/>Get angry, you'll win, Rocky. Come on. <br/>Come on, Dreamz. <br/>Come on, Rocky. <br/>Go, Dreamz, go! Go, Dreamz, go! Go, Dreamz, go! [ cheering] [ cheering] [ cheering]  Yeah, yeah! <br/>Probst: Moto scores first point. Moto leads 1-0. Moto leads 1-0. [ cheering] [ cheering] It is Cassandra versus Rita. Survivors ready? Go. <br/>Go, Cassandra! <br/>Probst: Cassandra uses her body, knocks Rita in. body, knocks Rita in. Moto leads two-zip. Moto leads two-zip. Next round, Edgardo taking on Anthony. Anthony looks like he's got a little fire in his belly. Survivors ready? Go. <br/>Come on, Ed! <br/>Probst: Anthony is in. Moto leads three-zip. Next round, it is Lisi taking on Michelle. Survivors ready? Go. Lisi hits her hard, pushes her off with no trouble. Moto leads four-zip. It's first tribe to seven. Boo taking on Earl. Survivors ready? Go. <br/>Come on, Boo! <br/>Let's go, Earl! <br/>Go, Boo, go! <br/>Come on, Boo! <br/>Come on, Boo, get him! <br/>Probst: Boo pushes Earl off. Moto leads five-zip. It is Alex taking on Mookie. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, Alex! Go, Alex! Go, Alex! Go! <br/>Come on, Alex! [ cheering]  Probst: Moto leads six-zip. We're down to the last two tribe members in this round. We have Yau-Man now squaring off against Stacy. <br/>Bulldoze him! <br/>Probst: Moto leads six-zip. Stacy wins here, it's over. Survivors ready? Go. <br/>Go, Stacy, go! Go, Stacy, go! <br/>Push, Stacy, push! <br/>Come on, Stacy! [ cheering]  Probst: Stacy in the water! Ravu scores their first point. <br/>That a boy, Yau. <br/>Yeah, Yau. <br/>Do what you got to do. <br/>Probst: Here's where we stand: Moto leads 6-1. This is a grudge match, Cassandra taking on Rita once again. Cassandra could win it for Moto right here. Survivors ready? Go. A hard push and a big fall for Rita. Moto wins reward! Moto, you will now send one person from the Ravu tribe to Exile Island. Who's it going to be? <br/>Earl. <br/>Probst: Earl, you will return in time for the next immunity challenge. Straight out this way, Earl. Ravu, once again I got nothing for you. Moto, congratulations on another win. Fishing gear, potatoes, toiletries, coffee, it's all yours. yours. Head on back. Head on back. <br/>Oh, my god! I love coffee. <br/>This is clean. I have not smelled anything clean in a long, long time. <br/>Let's make coffee. Let's make coffee. Let's make coffee. Let's make coffee now. <br/>Oh! That challenge was a winner[1]take-all  situation. Either we were going to get coffee, toiletries, bag of potatoes, and yet  again the fishing gear, or we were going to lose it all and potentially lose  our advantage. So it was a big deal. <br/>Coffee. Aw, they even gave us floss. That's all right. Y'all ain't got to talk to me. It's cool. <br/>Dreamz and Cassandra have no allies on this team. It's 5-2. They're going to get picked off. They know it. They're getting paranoid. It's not my problem. We're all adults here. There's no children. I mean, come on. It's Survivor. <br/>This ain't the instant dissolve coffee. It's one you got to filter. But it's so good. [ spitting]  What's going on, Boo... I mean Dreamz? You put the boiling water in there with the coffee. Yeah, you don't.... <br/>Do you know how to make it, man? <br/>Well, if you guys know how to make it, tell him how to make it. it. <br/>That's cool. <br/>That's cool. Y'all can say that to my face, you know, whatever y'all are saying back there. <br/>Stacy and Lisi I think, in particular, are just downright rude. It kind of nauseates me to see people being treated that way. It really kind of just rubbed me the wrong way. Well, I don't know how to freaking use it, so if someone can tell me...  You have to boil water. You put the coffee in the bottom, you pour the boiling water on top, and you  let it sit for about three minute, and then you press it down, and then you  have coffee, simple as that. <br/>This game to me is about almost immediate karma, and why they would treat  other human beings that way just as human beings, and in the course of the  game, why they wouldn't see how that might screw them in the that might screw  them in the future. future. <br/>Oh, my God, this is like a  Oh, my God, this is like a little piece of heaven. little piece of heaven. <br/>I'm really upset at Stacy and Lisi, because they're on a power trip, and if  they're in my alliance and they keep going that way, I'm going to make sure  they're out. <br/>This is, like, the best day  This is, like, the best day so far. so far. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Yau's been to Exile Island, so him and I have an understanding. I gave him this opportunity to actually look for the idol when I took  everybody on the excursion, and he says he couldn't find it. <br/>Clue number five: "Under the entrance, under the ground, right where  you're living, the idol is found." I know that already. I trust Yau. It pretty much just came down to not having the right tools. I don't think he'll find it before I get back, but you never before I get  back, but you never know. know. <br/>Sorry I didn't have the sumo technique down, but it's not my forte, you know? The only sumo I watched was... was what's it called? Austin Powers,Fat Bastard. <br/>Isn't it funny that we're both really into fashion? <br/>I know. And for me, truthfully, I go out, I'm just lip gloss, good to go. Because if I have to... on top of that, when I go and work, have to put all  that stuff on, I don't want to put that on. I mean, models walk around like this all day. I know for myself, my daily makeup routine is lip gloss and I'm out. And of course we fare better because we're... our ethnic skin is really on  our side. <br/>The whole lip-gloss thing, girl thing is really not my thing. Basically, I want to take my T-shirt and hang myself from a palm tree. <br/>So he's like, "Rita, why don't we go out tomorrow for lunch? Bring your friend."  My ears are oozing. You see this? That's the brain coming out. <br/>Let me say it to you like this. If we all had, like, a one[1]bedroom  apart, there was four of us in there, right?-- all right, let's say me and  you woke up earlier than everybody else all the time, and we had some things  we just had to talk about, you go out of the room. All these conversations they have are absolutely stupid. I want to smack them with a fried pineapple. I don't know what to do. It's driving me absolutely crazy. <br/>I'm one of those people that look high-maintenance, but I'm look  high-maintenance, but I'm so low maintenance. so low maintenance. <br/>So I've done the math on this, right? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>So let's assume we merge with ten people. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>If we win every single immunity, we end up with us seven, Ravu has three,  Cassandra and Dreamz switch over, now it's five and five voting-wise. <br/>Cool, whatever. <br/>No, it's not cool, whatever. We don't have the majority anymore. You know, for some reason, the whole situation with Dreamz and Cassandra had  just... it had really been... sort of been eating away at me, and I started  to do a little bit of math. Do you see the obvious, like, issue we have here? <br/>We do not need to do business with them at all, seriously. I don't think we should include Dreamz and Cassandra on anything. <br/>Excluding Cassandra and Dreamz is the dumbest thing we could do. If we don't keep them happy, they're going to flip-flop. they're going to flip-flop. Then we're all screwed. Then we're all screwed. <br/>Yeah, but we want them all gone. <br/>Yeah, see, dude, but... Oh, God, kill me! Kill me! Kill me right now! How do you not understand what How do you not understand what I'm trying to  say to you? I'm trying to say to you? <br/>I had a little talk with Alex, and we're like, "Listen, if Stacy and  Lisi are going to be like this, let's keep Cassandra and Dreamz close."  Boo is so dumb too. Boo does whatever they say. <br/>They think because five, they're in control. They're not thinking further ahead like you and me. So we're kind of the peace keepers in this tribe right now. We're trying to put our chess pieces in place so when we start really playing  the game, we have them at the right place at the right time. <br/>Now, we're going to have our internal whatevers, but at the end of the day,  we're a team, and the goal is to take Ravu out and make it as far as we can,  because we deserve every victory we've earned. <br/>I came back to the shelter, and it was like they'd embraced me again. It was like a warm embrace again. It didn't change my strategy of what to do come the merge. When we get into the merge, me and Cassandra are going to leave and go with  the other tribe. <br/>Let's just continue to battle, remember we're a team, and just bang it out,  just bang it out. <br/>Is that a solid solidarity, guys? <br/>It's a solid solidarity, guys. <br/>Solid? <br/>Everybody? <br/>That's a great plan, genocide, genocide. Saying genocide and wiping out Ravu, that's just part of the game now. It's like poker. You bluffing, acting like you got something when you don't. They're always talking about "Hey, it's a game; it's just  strategy." So I'm going to just show them. I can't wait till the day to put on my snakeskin boots to show on my  snakeskin boots to show them strategy. them strategy. them strategy. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Earl returning from Exile Island. <br/>Hey, Earl! <br/>What's going on? [ applause]  Probst: Shall we get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: First thing's first. <br/>Probst: First thing's first. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, your memory will be tested. Scattered in the field are 30 boards. Each board has a number or a word painted on it. One tribe member at a time will reveal two boards. If the numbers or words match, you score a point for your tribe. First tribe to seven wins immunity, guaranteed at least one more day out here  in Fiji. Losers, tribal council tonight, somebody going home. To make it a little more complicated, there are four dummy boards that do not  have a match. I'll give you a minute to strategize. strategize. We'll get started. We'll get started. Moto won the rock, paper, scissor. Once you leave the platform, there is no coaching from your tribe. Edgardo heads out for Moto. Edgardo flips over the seven. Trying to use his ESP and flips over the priest-- no match. Rocky heads out for Ravu. Rocky reveals the nine. Going somewhere new, hoping to get lucky. No luck. Rocky reveals the four. Cassandra heads out for Moto. Cassandra would like to reveal something that's already been shown. Cassandra reveals the eight, yet another new number. Cassandra hoping to get lucky. Cassandra... [ cheering] Cassandra lucks into a match. Moto on the board with their first pair. Mookie would like the same kind of luck, walk into a match. Mookie flips over a ten. Mookie flips over the seven, which excites Moto. Boo, he's jogging he's so excited. Boo flips over the first seven. Does he remember where the second seven is? Boo flips it over and has the second match for Moto. Moto up two-zip. Rita heads out for Ravu. Rita flips over the 14. Once again, Ravu will need some luck. A three. No score for Ravu. Stacy flips over a five. And Stacy flips over the priest. And Stacy flips over the priest. Ravu very excited. Ravu very excited. Yau-Man heading out on the course for Ravu. Yau-Man reveals one priest. Can he remember where the second Can he remember where the second priest just  was? priest just was? Yau-Man surveying the course, trying to remember, hasn't eaten much in a long  time. That sharp brain is a little That sharp brain is a little soft. soft. No help. No need to look this way. You're just going to tempt your tribe into losing a turn. Yau-Man cannot ask his tribe for help. help. It's all on him. It's all on him. Yau-Man makes his selection, and it is wrong. Yau-Man chooses princess, does not match up with priest. Chance for Ravu to get in this game just slipped through their fingers. Moto. Ooh! Lisi so excited she takes a face plant. Lisi runs right to the first priest. [ tribe groans]  Probst: No, no! Lisi, back to the platform. Just to be clear, Lisi, you lost your turn because your tribe spoke. You cannot do that. You lose a turn. Ravu's turn. <br/>Go, go. <br/>You got it, you got it. <br/>Probst: Big opportunity for Ravu. Will Ravu take back the opportunity that Yau-Man lost? Earl lifts the first priest. Earl, very confident, flips the second priest. Ravu on the board with their first point. Dreamz reveals the number five. Dreamz trying to remember. Dreamz trying to remember. Where was the other five? Where was the other five? Dreamz reveals the number ten. No match for Moto. <br/>Right here, the right of that. <br/>Right? <br/>Right. <br/>Probst: Anthony out on the course for Ravu. Anthony could tie it up. Anthony reveals a five. Looking to match up that five. Is he right? He is. [ cheering]  Probst: Anthony scores for Ravu. We are tied 2-2. [ applause]  Probst: Alex matches up the three. Rocky on the board for Ravu. <br/>What! <br/>Probst: We remain tied. Edgardo matches the two. [ applause]  Yeah! <br/>Probst: Ravu scores again. Stacy looking to match the ten, and she does. Yau-Man looking for that match. Alex is looking to match up... ...tie this game back up. Alex scores another match. And we are tied 6-6. All right, it comes down to this. There is only one matching pair left in the field. The rest are dummy boards. So the tribe that matches that last pair wins immunity. Ravu, you're up. Michelle could win it for Ravu right here. Michelle flips over the 13. If she matches the 13, Ravu wins their first challenge. [ groaning] She does not. Edgardo heads out for Moto. He could win it for Moto. Edgardo flips the 12. If he flips the 12, Moto wins. Edgardo flips the nine, does not match. Ravu again with an opportunity. <br/>Tell me where to go. <br/>Out between.... <br/>Come on, just give me something. <br/>Okay. <br/>Shh, come on! <br/>13, 14...  Probst: Rocky heading out for Ravu. Ravu could win it if Rocky can match up two symbols. He quickly flips the nine. [ Rocky laughs] Only a few boards left to reveal. If Rocky matches the nine, Ravu If Rocky matches the nine, Ravu wins their  first challenge. wins their first challenge. Rocky flips over the 12, no match for Ravu. Ravu squanders a huge opportunity and opens the door for Moto to continue  their winning streak. Cassandra reveals the nine. Cassandra could win it right here. [ cheering]  Probst: Cassandra reveals the nine. Moto wins immunity, remains undefeated. <br/>Argh! <br/>Probst: Moto, congratulations. <br/>Thank you. [ applause]  Probst: Immunity once again, safe from tribal council. Ravu, very close, just couldn't pull it together when you needed to. We have a date tonight at tribal. Somebody from this tribe is going home. Grab your stuff. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. <br/>Yo, can I say something real quick or no? I'm going to take the majority of the blame today, okay? Because you know, it was up to me at the end. And between all the talk... like, just I had a mental breakdown. You know, I didn't even know what number we were going for, to be honest with  you. So I dropped the ball. I want to apologize for that. But at the same time, this mass confusion thing, everyone talking at the same  time, everyone going [ gibbering] like that, like, in our dire straits right  now, mentally, how can anybody like...  Concentrate. <br/>...concentrate or comprehend absolutely anything? <br/>People have to listen and know when to be quiet, like...  It's not like I'm yelling at anybody. It's just...  No, but, you know, everyone has to really put the brakes on and know when to  step back and be quiet, because...  Let me ask you a question. When we were winning, when we were this close, is that the best you've felt  since you've been here? That's the best I've felt in 14 days. <br/>Getting rid of Rocky would probably get rid of a lot of the friction in the  tribe. If you lay your cards on the like that at this point, when people are looking  for anything, absolutely anything to get rid of somebody, don't be surprised  if people follow up on it. <br/>Rita is running her mouth all day, guys. All she does is run her mouth. All through the challenge, that's all she was doing. <br/>"It's over here! It's over here! It's over here!" A lot of us have been looking at Rita. Some folks are really sick of hearing from Rita. Around the last vote, my head was on the chopping block, but I'm going to  keep my ears open and hope nobody tries to flip the script on me, because  right now this is still anybody's now this is still anybody's vote. vote. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>What do you want to do  What do you want to do tonight? tonight? <br/>Is Anthony okay with you then? <br/>That's fine. <br/>Anthony okay with you? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>All right. Anthony okay with you, Yau-Man? Anthony okay with you, Yau-Man? All right, it's done. All right, it's done. <br/>Yup, we got our majority right there, so just let Rocky right there, so just  let Rocky know, okay? know, okay? know, okay? <br/>Yeah, I'm coming. <br/>Yeah, I'm coming. <br/>That mouth of hers, it drives me... am I wrong? Am I wrong, all the yakking and talking, bro? <br/>Well, you know what's funny is Anthony has been...  Shady, bro. <br/>He's starting to gain, like, a little confidence or something. Like personally, I'd like to take him out, but...  I got to get rid of Rita first, bro. I mean, worst comes to worst, he can be next, but Rita's got to go, buddy. Like, I don't know what's up with your boy Anthony. You know him better than me. I don't know if he's being shady or whatever. So I need you my side. <br/>Usually I'm the person that brings up strategy, like, "Well, let's do  this, let's do that." The other people are starting to devise their own  plans. I think before they were just going with the majority, but it seems like  everyone's doing their own thing, trying to play their own game now. their own game now. You have to watch your back. You have to watch your back. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man, you were so close. How frustrating is it? <br/>It's very frustrating, and for me, personally, it was very embarrassing. My brains went into neutral when it came to my turn, and I couldn't remember  something I saw 30 seconds ago. I hope it's a temporary condition, because otherwise I'm in bad shape. <br/>Probst: Mookie, did you guys get beat today, or did you give it away? <br/>Jeff, it's hard to, you know, follow through when everyone's talking to you  at one time. I know Rocky came up and took the blame for the last point, and it wasn't  completely his fault. We all jumped in, and we all told him where we thought things were, and you  know, we confused him. <br/>Probst: Rocky, why are you trying to take the fall? <br/>I swear if we would have won that challenge, that whole island would have  exploded. We were so close, and I took that away from myself, and I took that away from  my tribe, and I felt bad. <br/>Probst: Rita, you're going through something very extreme. When you get tired of thinking how bad things are, what do you talk about to  get your mind off of things? <br/>Well, I tell little stories that I think might be interesting to keep their  mind off this dire situation that we're in and try to keep everybody  entertained. <br/>Probst: Earl, are we at a point in the game where the reasons you vote  somebody out are starting to change? <br/>I do believe the reasons are starting to change. I really think before, some of the decisions were pretty quick. But I think now people are starting to get to know one another. I think it's about the chemistry. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man, been out here long enough that you can now say you trust the  people in this tribe anyway? <br/>My credo in life is love many, trust few, do wrong to none. So the question is what is few? Whether I trust them depends on whether my strategy dovetails with theirs or  not. <br/>Probst: Anthony, as we get ready to go to the vote, how uncomfortable are you  that it might be you? <br/>Fairly uncomfortable. I mean, my personality does clash with some people, and they may think that  I'm trying something when I'm trying to bring as much honesty to people as I  can. <br/>Probst: Okay, if anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play  it, you would present it to me after the votes have been cast but before I  read them. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Earl, you're up. Earl, you're up. <br/>As you know, this tribe works from majorities, and at this point, I couldn't  go against point, I couldn't go against them. them. <br/>We had our differences, but I like you a lot. like you a lot. Good luck. Good luck. <br/>It comes down to who is the most disposable. most disposable. Sorry, nothing personal. Sorry, nothing personal. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now is the  time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Anthony. Rita. One vote Rita. Anthony. Two votes Anthony. Rita. Two votes Anthony, two votes Rita. Rita. That's three votes Rita, two votes Anthony. Fifth person voted out of Survivor: Fiji,Rita. That's four, that's enough.

Good luck. <br/>Probst: Well, the good news is today's challenge showed you still have the  will to win. That will is what you got to hang on to tomorrow morning when you get up to  start another day. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor... Drop your buffs. <br/>What? <br/>...a major shake-up...  Come on, Dreamz. <br/>Probst: Maybe the biggest rivalry thus far just paired up. ...changes everything. <br/>Right now we're a super power. <br/>Probst: One very big decision left to make. Which group is going to live on the Moto beach and which group the Moto beach  and which group is going to Ravu? is going to Ravu? <br/>I'm really surprised, and I'm sad at the result tonight, but I understand  it's a game. I really tried to stay true and honest, and I did trust my alliances. So maybe I was just too nice to play the game. But if that's the case, I leave this game feeling very proud. I just hope that I have made my kids proud, because that's main kids proud,  because that's main reason that I did this.
