<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor,at Zhan Hu, James was doomed. <br/>If we lose tomorrow's immunity, James is going to be gone. <br/>Probst: But at the reward challenge... Fei Long wins reward! ...Fei Long kidnapped their old tribe mate, giving him a chance to survive. James, this is for you. At Fei Long, James chose Todd to receive the clue to the hidden immunity idol. <br/>I know what they're talking about. It's those stupid bats above the freaking thing. <br/>Probst: Todd found the hidden immunity idol, which was clearly marked  "Congratulations," and gave it to James as part of his and Amanda's  plan to throw the immunity challenge and take out a Zhan Hu member. <br/>Throw it. <br/>Because that's Jaime's ticket home. James loses immunity; they vote for him, but he uses the idol to get rid of  Jaime. <br/>Probst: He then told James about the second idol hidden at the Zhan Hu camp. <br/>All I have to do is stay focused, get the other idol. Now I'll have both of them. <br/>Probst: But at the immunity challenge... Go. <br/>Ah! <br/>Probst: ...Denise couldn't stomach the chicken fetus...  I can't swallow it. You can do it, James. Eat it up. <br/>Probst: ...making it impossible for James to deliberately lose the challenge,  ruining Todd's plan. Zhan Hu wins immunity. With Fei Long facing tribal council...  Genius idea smashed. <br/>Probst: ...Sherea seemed like a sure bet to go home, but Courtney lobbied to  get rid of Jean-Robert. <br/>That's my enemy. <br/>I don't trust Sherea. I trust her more than I trust Jean-Robert. <br/>I feel like we should vote out Jean-Robert tonight. <br/>Todd, I don't know. My gut feeling is that I don't trust Sherea. <br/>And my gut's saying Jean[1]Robert. This sucks. <br/>Probst: At tribal council, Courtney attacked Jean-Robert's character. <br/>He walks around, he talks a lot, a lot of judgments of other people. He's just a crappy person. <br/>Probst: Despite Courtney's plea to get rid of Jean-Robert, the tribe saved  him once again. Sixth person voted out of Survivor: China,Sherea. Ten are left. Ten are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>That was a little bit of a surprise. I didn't even know there was I didn't even know there was that kind of  tension. that kind of tension. <br/>I promise you, Amanda, if somebody did that to you, you'd be a little bit  upset about it too. <br/>I personally, Jean-Robert, feel like my personal feelings towards you have  changed. I like the guy you kind of showed me who you can be. I can't speak for Courtney, and you can't speak for her. And you know, I just... I just... you guys have a tiff. And if you guys resolve it, that's what you guys can do. If not, then not, you know? <br/>Jean-Robert, he's horrible to me. He's not nice to me. They suck up to him, even the two people who want to be, like, my friends--  like, "friends"-- Todd and Amanda. I don't feel like I really need to be anybody's friend in this game. I dislike everyone else more than I dislike Todd and Amanda. I think they mistake that for I think they mistake that for friendship. friendship.

You know that? You know that? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, to each other, yeah. <br/>Don't let me down, okay? <br/>Let you down how? <br/>Just stick with us. As long as we all stick together, you know, if we merge, we basically  sacrificed one of our old tribe mates for you. <br/>We'll see how it goes. Hopefully...  I mean, like, honestly, like, I like you. Like, I think, like... I think you've been a huge, like, competitor in this  game, and, like, I'm one of those people, like, I would rather see you go  further just because I really do think you deserve it. I really like James personally. I do-- whether he's a really good con man or he is exactly how he puts himself  out to be. From what I've seen so far, my From what I've seen so far, my gut instinct is  to trust James. gut instinct is to trust James. <br/>I was kidnapped, so, you know, I got the clue for the idols. I wasn't going to do like Todd did and be impatient. There are so many times when There are so many times when you're by yourself. you're by yourself. I picked off one. It was the wrong one. It was a blank sheet of wood. So I hurried and picked off the So I hurried and picked off the second one. second one. I kind of had to hustle off to I kind of had to hustle off to my bag and hide  it. my bag and hide it. Did y'all get anything? <br/>We didn't rack up, but we got a decent amount. <br/>So I have it now. I have it in my position, and I have the two idols. That's funny. That's funny. I'm on Survivorwith two idols. I'm on Survivorwith two idols. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes, it is. <br/>This morning, I slept in. I was in a good mood. And Courtney comes up and sits down, and she's like [ sighing]. We all kind of look at her like, "Uh, are you okay, Courtney?"  Jean-Robert could have gone last night. <br/>What? <br/>He could have gone last night. <br/>From the way that I'm playing the game, I need him. <br/>Okay. <br/>From the way you're playing the game, you didn't. <br/>But, like, when I make a point to you guys that, like, this guy does not like  me, he's not nice to me, and I don't feel like you stick up for me, I feel  like you play, like, "Okay, well, we need him, so da, da, da, da,"  I can't go along with that. <br/>I don't realize that I do that, Courtney, and I would love to stand up for  you. <br/>You don't have to even stand... just, like, don't pander to him and say,  "You have a point, Jean-Robert."  You have your opinion about him. You don't have to like him. <br/>But I don't say anything to him. <br/>I know you don't. <br/>But he walks around falling around like he's the god everything, and you guys  are all like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."  We can't have him know that we don't like him, Courtney. We can't, or else he will swap on us. <br/>He's not here. You can say something to me. Like, the three of you can...  Courtney, you are right. <br/>All right. You know...  It does worry me that Courtney will continue to vote for Jean-Robert every  single time, because all the other tribe, if there is a merge, needs to know  that one person is voting against Jean-Robert, and they will automatically  have Jaime, Peih-Gee, and Erik with Courtney voting against Jean[1]Robert,  and that's a campaign to get him off, which is losing one of our numbers. Can we patch things up between us instead of having hard feelings like that? <br/>What difference does it make? <br/>It makes a big difference,  It makes a big difference, Courtney. Courtney. <br/>What does she want? Like, what does she expect from me? Right now I need my numbers, and Jean-Robert is one of my numbers. numbers. Deal with it, bitch. Deal with it, bitch. <br/>This used to be hanging on the archway, and it looks like someone took it off. I don't know if it was James, because James now knows that there's a hidden  immunity idol as well. I don't know if he knows where it is or what it is, but you know, it looks  idol-ish. Peih-Gee didn't really think much of it. She doesn't know there's a hidden idol yet. So Peih-Gee left. I just was like, "Well, I guess I'll grab it," and put it in my bag. <br/>It could definitely say, like, "Immunity idol" in Chinese, and I'd  have no idea. It's a weird symbol, so I don't It's a weird symbol, so I don't know what it  stands for. know what it stands for. I just want to look in his bag. Do you think he'll see me if I Do you think he'll see me if I pull it out? pull it out? I knew it. He has one in here. Hey, you watch over there. Make sure they're not coming back. Peih-Gee and James went off to go frog hunting, so I saw James' bag sitting  there, and I figured it might be a good idea to look through it, because we  know James would have had a good idea where the hidden immunity idol where  the hidden immunity idol was. was. I think it's the same thing we have. Look. He's got... he's got one in his pant leg. <br/>He's got two? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. He has two of them. He has two of them. <br/>The first board where the immunity idol could have been was a blank board. Apparently it's missing, because I didn't see it. I know that an animal didn't come up and pick it up and take come up and pick  it up and take it away. it away. The other one's filled. Does it some more water? <br/>I'll bring it over. Let's see. <br/>I figured Jaime would have been looking for it, but there's no way this dummy  grabbed the wrong one, because it would have to say "Immunity"  something on it. The thought of this woman having a blank one, I would not be able to take it. I would pass out in pure joy. My head would explode. I mean, please, let that happen, please. That would be the best thing ever. That would be the best... that would be the best one ever, if she pulled out  a blank thing and was like... "What do you mean? But it don't have no writing on there. You at least have to have You at least have to have some... one of  these!" some... one of these!" some... one of these!"  Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. Zhan Hu getting your first look at the new Fei Long tribe. Sherea voted out at the last tribal council. Guys ready to get to it? <br/>Yes. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Probst: One of the major tenets in The Art of Waris to know not only  yourself, but to know your opponent. Drop your buffs. You are merged. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>What? <br/>Hi. <br/>All right, one big happy family. <br/>Hi, how are you? <br/>We have merged. So it's pretty exciting. I really don't know how to take it all in right now. It happened so fast. You know, we just have such a wide variety of people, so it's a pretty scary  point in the game. So I'm excited to have the hidden immunity idol. That's going to be a whole new ball game. <br/>We made the merge, huh? <br/>Probst: New buffs. [ cheering]  Oh, my God! Oh, black, you guys! <br/>Ninja buffs! <br/>Probst: Reach into the pot. Frosti, Todd. <br/>Oh, my God, they smell good. <br/>Oh, they smell so good! <br/>These are awesome! <br/>Probst: Go ahead and put them on, get the new look going. <br/>I love them. <br/>Probst: All right, in keeping with The Art of War,Fei Long, since thus far  you have won the battle, you will keep your beach. In addition, when you get back to camp, you will find a flag, paint, and a  new boat. You'll come up with a tribe name, paint up a new flag. <br/>Sweet. <br/>Probst: To celebrate the merge, you will now enjoy a merge feast. <br/>Yeah! [ cheering and applause]  Probst: In addition to the feast, you will enjoy an afternoon of Chinese  cultural performances. <br/>Cool! <br/>Probst: All right, now I give you this strong reminder. As you head out this afternoon, keep in mind this game never stops. Keep that in mind as you enjoy this afternoon. Head out. Follow the bridge to the entrance. [ cheering] Have a good time. <br/>Jeff told the group we're getting to enjoy a feast. At the same time, there was a little caution: "The game never  ends." I was trying to decide what exactly is he trying to say right  here?-- you know, the game never ends. I put a little thought into it, but I was just so excited to be eating. Honestly, I just couldn't wait till the first course. [ firecrackers popping]  Whoo! Yeah, baby! <br/>Oh, my God. We go in, and we sit down at a table. I was pretty pumped, because boo challenges, yay feast. <br/>Look how many dips there are. <br/>Sweet and sour pork, you guys. <br/>Beef. <br/>Beef. <br/>They brought in five vegetarian dishes and five meat dishes. And we also got several choices of alcoholic beverage, which I enjoyed. I thought it was quite nice. <br/>Congratulations, you guys, on making it to the top ten. <br/>Yeah, everybody, congratulations. This is great. [ cheering]  Shoot them up. <br/>Yeah, girls! <br/>Whoo! <br/>We had a Chinese acrobat show, which was amazing. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Those people were so talented. It was just so cool to sit there and drink and watch a great show. <br/>Whoa-- easy! <br/>Whoa-- easy! [ applause] [ applause]  We got to see girls doing cool stuff with plates, girls twist their bodies  into stuff I've never seen before. <br/>Oh, my goodness! Oh, wow. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Wow. That's a push-up. <br/>I can do that. <br/>All in all, it was just amazing. We were all just sitting there like, "Are they really doing that right  now?" It was so cool. It was so cool. [ firecrackers popping] [ firecrackers popping]  The first thing I thought when we merged was "Who are we going to pick  off next?"  Wow, girls, you had me at "Hello."  Because even though we're one tribe now, it's still two tribes, and we will  continue to be that way until all the Zhan Hu members are completely gone. Hu members are completely gone. [ firecrackers popping] [ firecrackers popping]  Oh, my lord! <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Whoo! <br/>That's our shelter. <br/>A lot smaller. <br/>It does not keep anything warm or dry. <br/>Your shelter sucks! <br/>A great shelter. <br/>That means your shelter sucks! <br/>No, our shelter is awesome. <br/>This is your shelter. <br/>Oh, it looks so much better than I even thought, though. <br/>The merge doesn't change my game plan at all. Basically, the members of Zhan Hu, they're going to go whether we're merged  or not. <br/>I want to try this baby out. <br/>I do like my position now. The merge has gotten everybody into this, like, new tone, like we've just  gotten to this new level of the game. And to be honest with you, even though my name was on ballots at the first  two tribal councils that I was at, I really don't see my name being on a  ballot at see my name being on a ballot at the next council. the next council. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Hungry monkeys. <br/>I feel like hungry monkeys. <br/>Angry monkeys. How about angry monkeys? <br/>Something to represent black buffs, you know? <br/>"Black" is "hei"in Chinese. <br/>We can be "Black" something or other. We can't be "Black," because then as soon as James is gone, we'll  have to change the name. <br/>That did not just come out of your mouth. <br/>Oh, my god. [ Jean-Robert laughing]  I'm going to stay here. I'll be all right. <br/>Whatever. I was on the yellow team. They put Peih-Gee... they put Peih-Gee and me on the yellow team. [ laughter]  We were on the yellow team. <br/>I do like the idea of "Black" something. I do... I really do like the idea of "Black" something. <br/>Monsoon survivors. <br/>I like it. I like "Black Monsoon," because we're here during monsoon season. <br/>Does anybody know how to say "monsoon"? <br/>"Dei fung." "Da fung"is "fighting wind." It is  a unifying factor. <br/>We got through the wind. We got through the rain. I think it's good. <br/>It'll literally be "Fighting Wind."  "Fighting Wind."  "Black Fighting Wind."  "Black Fighting Wind."  Now that we've merged, we are all playing for individual immunity. But there are six original Fei Long members to four original Zhan Hu. The biggest factor is whether I have James and whether I have Frosti. If I can get them both with me on these first two votes... these first two  votes are crucial for me to know whether I'm going to be in a powerful  position or a really sucky position or a really sucky position. position. <br/>It is Jeff! <br/>Jeff's here. Guys, guys, you got a visitor. <br/>Probst: No welcome? <br/>Jeff's here! <br/>Hey, Jeff! [ applause]  Hey, guys, guys, Jeff's here! <br/>Jeff's at our camp! <br/>Is anyone listening? <br/>Nobody cares? <br/>Probst: What up? <br/>Welcome! <br/>Hey, Jeff! <br/>Hi! <br/>Probst: Working on the new flag? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Nice. What's the tribe name? <br/>Hei Da Fung. <br/>"Black Fighting Wind."  Probst: "Black Fighting Wind," Hei Da Fung. <br/>Hei Da Fung. <br/>Probst: Well, I brought you a little something. <br/>We love a little something. <br/>We love everything. <br/>Is it cookies? <br/>Probst: It's not cookies. <br/>Pizza! <br/>Probst: It's not pizza. It's something much better than food. It is a gift for one of you. It is the individual immunity necklace. necklace. <br/>Wow! <br/>Wow! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: And I brought it because it is time for our first individual immunity  challenge. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Follow me. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Plop a seat wherever  Probst: Plop a seat wherever you like. you like. So before the merge celebration, I said, "Let me issue one reminder: the  game never stops." And I suggested you keep it in mind as you enjoyed  the festivities. For today's challenge, you will be tested on your recollection of events that  happened during of events that happened during the feast and the celebration. the feast and the celebration. You'll have a tablet. You'll write your answer down. If you're wrong, you're out-- single elimination, no second single  elimination, no second chances. chances. <br/>Probst: Last person left standing wins individual immunity, is safe at the  next tribal council. For the other nine, somebody For the other nine, somebody will be going home. will be going home. <br/>I'm so screwed. <br/>Probst: You say you're screwed? Why, Frosti? <br/>I have a horrible memory. <br/>Probst: Going into this challenge, who is ready for it? Anybody here pay particular attention? <br/>I paid particular attention to how much I could eat. <br/>Probst: You guys ready for the first question? Here we go, first question: how many times during the celebration did  firecrackers go off? Nothing subtle about the firecrackers when they went off. Everybody reveal. Correct answer is three. There's one at the beginning, one during, and one at the end of the feast. James got it wrong. Amanda got it wrong. Courtney got it wrong. And Peih-Gee got it wrong. You are all out of the challenge. Todd got it right. Frosti, Jaime, Jean-Robert got it right. And Denise and Erik got it right. We are down to six. What was the centerpiece on the table? Describe it. Tell me what it was. Everybody reveal. Todd says a dragon. Frosti, Jaime, Jean-Robert all say a dragon. Denise says a dragon. And Erik says a slender, dark, glass container...  "Slender dark glass container-- soy sauce?-- and a stone dragon."  Probst: So you covered the whole table. It's a good thing you did. The last thing was right. Dragon is correct. Everybody got it right. Next question: there was a tall pole with knife blades as ladder rungs in the  middle of the courtyard. What color was the pole? One long, tall pole situated in the middle of the courtyard-- what color was  the pole? All right, everybody reveal. Todd originally wrote yellow. He changed it to red. Frosti and Jaime say yellow. Jean-Robert said red. Denise said red. Erik said red. Correct answer was yellow. <br/>There we go! <br/>Probst: Todd is out. Jean-Robert is out. And Denise and Erik are out. We are down to Frosti and Jaime. If one of you misses and the other gets it right, that person wins individual  immunity. Next question, immunity on the line: the four cultural dancers with the long,  flowing skirts wore what on their feet? The four cultural dancers, they had the long, flowing skirts. What did they wear on their feet? <br/>This is not fair, because I was not looking at their feet. <br/>Probst: All right, reveal. Jaime says silk stockings. Frosti says nothing. The correct answer is... nothing. Frosti wins first individual immunity. <br/>Wow, Frosti. [ applause]  Probst: Come on over. Turn around, brother. Congratulations. You're safe at the next tribal council, guaranteed a one in nine shot at a  million bucks. For the rest of you, somebody will be going home. For once, you don't have to go back to camp. You're already here. I'll split. I'll see you at tribal council. I'll see you at tribal council. Congratulations. Congratulations. <br/>Damn. From now on, we got to go to every tribal. <br/>Huh? <br/>Now we have to go to every tribal. The predicament today is that there's tribal council. There's a big chance that it's going to be me, Jaime, or Erik that's going  home, since Frosti has immunity. And the big question mark is do we have James's vote? And we don't know if James is on And we don't know if James is on our side. our side. <br/>Huh? Uh-huh. <br/>This is a huge vote for us tonight, because we will know where everybody's  loyalties stands. I mean, it's going to be really I mean, it's going to be really interesting. interesting. <br/>How great would that be? You've got them both though? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Five, right? Me, you, Amanda, Denise, Courtney. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Beautiful. <br/>Please hold that together. <br/>I promise to. I'll shake on it. <br/>I mean, you know I can't talk to you that much, especially right now, but I  just had to right now, but I just had to tell somebody. tell somebody. <br/>We just have to keep loyal. We can't let Jaime and Peih-Gee and Erik break us up. <br/>No. <br/>I don't think Erik will. Jaime is a silent leader of the old Zhan Hu Tribe, definitely. She's really close with Erik, and by getting rid of Jaime, it'll break up  that alliance. And Peih-Gee you can just kind of see through, you know. She's a little devious. But Jaime is so threatening because people don't see that right away with  Jaime. Denise is in for sure. Me, you, like, are locked in. Todd is locked in now. But Courtney kind of has a mind of her own. Courtney said at tribal council she doesn't have anyone here she likes except  Sherea. She was saying stuff like that. She like, "Well, you guys keep voting off everyone I like. You voted off Leslie. You want to vote out Sherea." I'm like, "Courtney, this is a I'm  like, "Courtney, this is a game." game."  Well, the problem is Courtney keeps getting close to people that we can't  have here. <br/>I mean, we've done everything  I mean, we've done everything so good. so good. <br/>I know, I know. <br/>We've got to watch Courtney because she is a loose cannon. She does stray off and fall in love with any swinging Dick or Harry that  floats and smiles at her. But damn, you don't get friends on Survivor. This ain't Love Connection. Ain't nobody trying to get a match or a relationship. You're supposed to make the strongest team you can and align with some people  you somewhat can trust to win a million dollars and stop playing around! <br/>Thank you. <br/>It's good. We have every vote from here on out. <br/>I know. <br/>Okay? I love it. It will be you, me, and Amanda. <br/>It's perfect. <br/>100%. <br/>You know right now it has to go Jaime, Peih-Gee, Erik. <br/>I am going to make a suggestion, and hear me out on this. Everybody on our team already knows Jaime is shady. We're already suspicious of her, and nobody's going to trust her. Peih-Gee we don't know about because she's just starting to work her magic. <br/>Right. <br/>Like I said. Today I was, like, surprised. She just went and plopped her arm on me. I was like, "You know what? That's kind of cool. That's kind of cool." I was like, "That's kind of cool. This girl's kind of cool. This girl's all right." I don't want her to feel all right. <br/>And she's working her way with Courtney. <br/>I don't want to feel all right with her in a few days. <br/>Right. <br/>You know? <br/>So...  Oh, one thing also. If somehow you do end up screwing me over, you know, the game or whatever--  and I don't believe that's going to happen, but if I get screwed, I'm going  to hold you responsible, not Amanda. <br/>Okay. <br/>Just so you know. And you will never, ever see a juror lobby so hard against somebody. You will not win. <br/>Okay, okay. <br/>If I get screwed, it's going to be on you, because I know you have more power  than her. <br/>Okay. <br/>Yeah. It's the three of us. We're going. <br/>Good. <br/>If I didn't agree to all of his terms, right away the trust with me and him,  he wouldn't trust me anymore, so he would have moved along and found another  alliance and done who knows what. So of course I agreed to it all and was like "Yeah, we're going to the  top three, man. We're going all the way. I'm watching your back." Little does Jean-Robert know... like, little  clue, no, he has no idea that I'm ready to... when I idea that I'm ready to...  when I need to. need to. <br/>I have no idea. Some days I do. Some days I do. Some days I don't. Some days I don't. Some days I don't. <br/>Uh-huh, I'm sure they will. <br/>Uh-huh, I'm sure they will. <br/>Did she? <br/>Did she? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Well, hello. <br/>Well, hello. <br/>Me and Erik found it, and he has it in his pack. <br/>Wait. <br/>Okay, this... I'll...  How do you know it's the immunity idol? <br/>Because there's two sides to the sign, right? We were lying there. One day I was on the bed, and it was just lying on the floor. So I picked it up, and I was like, "Erik, what is it?" We're like,  "I don't know." So he put it in his bag. Well, then the next day, we found two of them in James's bag. So we're like, "He must have got spooked by us and dropped it." And  we picked it up and put it in our possession. We're thinking we'll play it tonight anyway, no matter what. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>If they're all voting for me, and I have the idol, then the only votes that  count are ours, so Jean-Robert will be voted out instead. So we might as well try and use it tonight. <br/>Jaime came up to me with Erik and said that she had found something that she  thought was an idol. Now, I've seen the actual idol from the Fei Long camp. And what she's describing is similar, so there is a possibility that she has  one. The worst that would happen would be that Jean-Robert would end up going home  if she knew to play it. And now that I've won the immunity idol, I'm in a safe place, and both tribes  think that I'm with them. So I could easily be considered a swing vote, and I could go either way. <br/>What are you thinking? <br/>Do you know anything about the immunity idol over here? <br/>Well, I know a little, but not much. <br/>Okay. If you can somehow just keep me here tonight, I think I know who has your immunity  idol, and I know who has mine. <br/>Do you know who has them both? <br/>I do. <br/>Okay. <br/>And I'll tell you tomorrow if you can keep me around. <br/>And you know, I acted all interested when Jaime told me that she knew who had  the hidden immunity idols and that she was going to tell me, but she made it  sound like someone from their tribe has one and someone from our tribe has  one. Wow, does she have to catch up. So... she's... she's on the small bike in the back, you know, just pedaling  as fast as she can. How did you find out who got ours? <br/>Um, long story. I'll explain it, everything, but...  Okay, okay. <br/>I've come to realize that I'm very good at playing stupid, and it works to my  advantage, so I think I'm just going to stick on with it. As far as the other tribe's concerned, I think they kind of think I'm little  Jessica Simpson out here running around in the jungle. If Todd sees me play the hidden immunity idol tonight, he's definitely going  to be floored when he sees it come out. I think it's probably going to shock everyone, including Jeff. I'm not as dumb as I look, and maybe they're figuring it out. <br/>Dude, I'm telling you, it has to go Peih-Gee and then Jaime. <br/>I don't want any dissension amongst us until we get to the final six, until  all of them are gone. Then we can act as much as a fool as we want. <br/>It's Peih-Gee. <br/>We can't screw this up. <br/>I'm telling you it's done. <br/>There should be no mistaking. <br/>I'm just telling you 100%, that's where I'm going. <br/>No, don't say that. We're going to pick who it is, and we're sticking together. <br/>It's Peih-Gee. Okay, yes, we are. <br/>Jean-Robert probably would go home tonight, because Jean[1]Robert  is stupid. <br/>This girl is the enemy. This girl is the devil! This girl is the devil! <br/>The best scenario is for the Fei Long Tribe to stick together and vote off  the Zhan Hu Tribe, but Jean-Robert's dumb ass is going to vote for Peih-Gee,  even though we all said Jaime. It's been Jaime for a month now. The Zhan Hu people naturally are going to vote for Jean-Robert. They know he's the easy win. And lord help him if Courtney's dumb ass decides to vote for Jean-Robert out  of pure spite because she just wants to be because she just wants to be  hateful. hateful. <br/>Probst: Full house. Amanda, from a game point of view, how did the merge change the game? <br/>Well, Jeff, it's kind of nice, actually, because we spent a lot of time as,  like, Fei Long, wondering what the other tribe was doing. So it's kind of nice to have some new people around, and we all get along  really well. We're having a lot of fun. <br/>Probst: Peih-Gee, when you hear Amanda say it's fun, does that make you think  she has no clue what this game is about or that she's extremely confident  that she's not going anywhere? <br/>Well, of course, I mean, they have higher numbers. So I'm sure it's easier for them to have fun. <br/>Probst: Jean-Robert, you're a student of people. Have you noticed a shift in how people are operating? <br/>It's so interesting how the dynamic changed from the team now to the individual. Now that we're in the individual situation, I very much see Courtney making  it down to the bottom two, bottom three, because she's not going to be  perceived as the type of threat that James or myself might be. So now she's somebody that nobody's going to be gunning for for a while. I don't see her name showing up on a ballot for a long time. <br/>Probst: Courtney, you're rolling your eyes. Why? <br/>Because this is now Jean[1]Robert  trying to be like, "The biggest threat in the room is the little blonde! Come on, everyone!" It's a person who I don't get along with pointing  out that all of a sudden I'm going to be the biggest threat there is. It's just... it's funny. <br/>I didn't say she's going to be the biggest threat. I said that it's likely she's going to get the furthest. <br/>Which translates to "You're a big threat."  I don't think it does. It means that you're not a threat. And the same is true for several people in this group. <br/>Probst: James, why does that bother you? <br/>Jean-Robert, he just don't be quiet. I don't know. He just don't stop. <br/>Probst: And you think that that might become a liability? <br/>Yeah, he puts his name on the chopping block because he's always saying,  "Oh, well, I'm going on the chopping block today." He'll mention it  every day. When he's tired, he'll announce that he's tired. He doesn't have to do that. See, when you're tired, just go lay down. We understand. You're a card player. You haven't been in the sun. You're used to people bringing the food up to you, probably putting it in  your mouth and helping you chew. You know, we don't expect that much from you. So you don't have to go on and on about it, which I guess is part of his  tactic. But I'm like, "Dude, you don't have to talk that much."  Probst: Peih-Gee, when you guys all merged together, did you try to find  cracks in the Fei Long group? <br/>You kind of know about some of the cracks already. We've had spies back and forth. I know Jean-Robert's name has come up quite a bit. He's politicking his ass off. He's doing everything he can to ensure that he's got as many votes on the  jury as possible. <br/>Probst: Jaime, what do you think the key is to getting the attention off you? If you hear that your name is on the block, what should you do? <br/>You know, I just kind of wanted to come in here and talk to the Fei Long  members, just in case there was a crack, just in case there was someone on  that team that they just can't stand enough that they would be happy to get  rid of. You know, it just would take one other person to be like, "I really  can't stand this person anymore; I want them to go home, and Jaime is more  pleasant to be around, so..."  Probst: All right, Frosti has the immunity necklace. I know you're not giving it up. You cannot vote for Frosti. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. It's time to vote. Erik, you're up. Erik, you're up. Erik, you're up. <br/>Trying to keep it Zhan Hu. <br/>Trying to keep it Zhan Hu. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. <br/>Jeff, I have a question for you. <br/>Probst: Yes. <br/>I found this at camp lying on the floor, so I thought it might be immunity. be immunity. <br/>Probst: Thanks. <br/>Probst: Thanks. The rules of Survivorstate that if the hidden immunity idol is played, any  votes cast against that person will not count, and the person with the next  highest number of votes be will be sent home. That's in the case of a hidden immunity idol being played. This, however, is not a hidden This, however, is not a hidden immunity idol. immunity idol. <br/>Oh, my gosh! [ laughter] Oh, oh! <br/>Probst: Any votes cast against Jaime will count. I'll now read the votes. First vote, Jean-Robert. Jaime. Jaime. Two votes Jaime, one vote Jean[1]Robert. Jean-Robert. We're tied, two votes Jaime, two votes Jean-Robert. Jean-Robert. That's three votes Jean-Robert, two votes Jaime. Jaime. Tied again, three votes Jaime, three votes Jean-Robert. Jaime. Four votes Jaime, three votes Jean-Robert. Jaime. That's five votes Jaime, three votes Jean-Robert. Seventh person voted out of Survivor: Chinaand the first member of our jury,  Jaime. That's six. That's enough. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Jaime, the tribe has spoken. Jaime, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. Well, the game has just shifted again. With Jaime becoming the first member of the jury, you are now voting people  out of the game who will ultimately decide who they feel is most deserving of  the title of sole survivor and the million dollars that goes with it. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night.

I would love to see some craziness. <br/>Probst: ...Todd wants to blindside James. <br/>If we blindside him, both immunities would be out of play. <br/>Probst: ...causing his alliance to question his leadership. <br/>Todd is all over the place right now. <br/>He won't listen to anyone. <br/>Probst: And Peih-Gee makes a power play. <br/>There's five of us here. <br/>There's five of us here.

I made a bad decision with James. He's obviously not very trustworthy, and I hate that I trusted him. I'm kicking myself in the butt right now. I tried to plain the hidden immunity idol. It wasn't it, but it was worth a It wasn't it, but it was worth a shot, so  I'm glad I tried it.
