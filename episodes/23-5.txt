<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor":  We are neck and neck in our first immunity challenge! For the past 17 days, it's been a see saw battle between two of Survivor's  most evenly matched tribes. This is how close this challenge was. One coconut away. At Savaii, Ozzy found a hidden immunity idol. Something good! Jeff: And thought he was in control of the dominant alliance. I am the anchor. They want me to tell them how to do everything. Jeff: But one of his allies, Jim, was plotting against him. Jim teamed up with Cochran and Dawn to target Ozzy. If Elyse goes first, that buys me another three days. Jeff: At Upolu, Coach was safe in his alliance. I think I’m sitting pretty right now. Jeff: But not everyone was a Coach fan. I'm not buying Coach's bs at all. Jeff: Stacey was on the chopping block so she looked in vain for the immunity  idol. Ty immunity challenge, Dawn proved she is one of the competitors. Dawn wins for Savaii! Upolu went to tribal council where Brandon, the nephew of the notorious Russell  Hantz, broke down. You feel a responsibility to reclaim the family name in a positive light? I'm gonna do it. Jeff: Fourth person voted out the "Survivor: South Pacific." in the  end, Stacey was voted out and she passed on a hug from Coach on her way to Redemption  Island. Tracy, the tribe has spoken. Where she will soon battle with her old friend, chris Christine. 14 are left, who will be voted out tonight? Hello? Christine, it's Stacey. Hey! Oh, be careful. Okay. You got it so comfy over here. I was hoping it wouldn't be you. I know. But that's okay. How are you? I'm good, I’m good. Them snakes over there. What happened? Girl. What the hell is going on? Christine, guess who is running things? Coach. I-- I knew it. Everybody-- they were at tribal acting like everything is hunky-dory. It ain't hunky-dory. You who talk to. I talk to all the girls, I’m doing this. Yeah-- lies straight from hell. All y'all gonna go to hell with gasoline dropped on you. Just survive. I missed you so much. Tribal was so fake, sufficiency so fake. That is not one big happy family on the blue tribe. Coach comhere, and he try to act like he's just all holier than thou. He is nothing but a joke. When they find out the really truth about him... I'm going to start up a  bee's nest and let the red tribe know Coach is in control over there. I'm anything to spill everything I know is going on over there. Captioning brought to you by Survivor productions, cbs, how are you Brandon? I'm doing good. Good morning, everyone. I'm sorry to wake everybody but we have tree mail. Tribal council was emotional, man. The way that Mikayla answered jeff's question when he asked what she doesn't  like about me the most, she said, "i don't like he's a Hantz" it  was pretty prejudiced. The way she handled that shows she had very little class at that time. You know, these are real people out here. They have real-- they have feelings, you know. And I don't care what people think about me. It doesn't matter. I mean, I’m a good person. I'm a good guy. And, you know, if I can't win the game like that, then I don't need to win it. Outwit, outplay, outlast. Two more from redemption and two more from your tribe win the attention. Today, Christine and Stacey are battling it out and the other tribe could get  intele from us and and I’m hoping when Albert comes back that Stacey and Christine  kept their mouth shut. Jeff: We'll now bring in the competitors for today's duel. Christine will battle against Stacey voted out at the last tribal council. Welcome to Redemption Island arena. Stacey, what's it like for you to see your former tribe mates who voted you  out? Those-- those are liars, so, red team, look out for those right there, okay? It wasn't a team. It is benjamin, Albert, and Sophie. But who are they answering to, benjamin and Albert. Jeff: Benjamin, Coach. Benjamin is running the team. Benjamin makes the decisions. Makes all the decisions. Jeff: When I said Coach, you said, no, benjamin. There's a difference? Adults call him benjamin. Whether he likes it or not, it's benjamin. Jeff: So your way of fighting back is to say I will not honor the Coach name. What's his name? What was his birth name? It wasn't Coach. It was benjamin, wasn't it. And the children, 26, 22, they listen to all the benjamin's halloween jokes,  chuck e. Cheese jokes. They want it. Come on, every day he got a story. I wasn't buying it. No. So, like yesterday, like the tribal was all cahoots, let's give a hug. Keep that hug. For me. Because it wasn't real. Sour grapes. Jeff: You guys ready to get to today's duel. Yeah. Jeff: Today's duel will require concentration and coordination. You're going to drop a ball down a chute. It will spiral downward until it falls out the bottom where you must catch  it, put it back in the chute. Every few minutes we'll add another ball. The balls will alternate left and right, making it more difficult to track  them. If at any point a ball hits the ground, you're out of the duel. Last person left standing stays alive on Redemption Island. The loser is out of this game for good. This is it, one shot. Take your spots. You go, girl. You, too. Jeff: All right, here we go. Take your first ball. And drop it in the chute. We are on. You want to live to see another day in this game? You must win. Concentration. That is the key to this challenge. One ball is pretty easy. All right, you have 10 seconds to add another ball. Remember to think about your spacing. It's critical in this challenge. Two balls a little tRickier. And they're alternating left and right. Hard to track. You guys are doing great. Keep concentrating. All right, you have 10 seconds. Think about your spacing. Stacey drops a ball right off the bat, not paying any attention to what the  other balls are doing. You have 10 seconds and she just throws it in. So stupid. Jeff: Christine taking her time, placing it. Using the spacing. Everybody's good. Three balls now. Very difficult. Absolute concentration in this challenge. Christine with a nice save. There are no tomorrows for the loser. You will be out of this game for good. Christine with another nice save. Just a matter of time. Jeff: You guys have a good rhythm going. You're doing a great job. Stacey drops a ball. Christine stays alive on Redemption Island! [ applause ] good job, you guys. Good job. Jeff: Stacey. Yeah. Jeff: What did this adventure mean for you? I challenged myself. This is something I never would have done. You know, I’m a funeral director, mortician is what I am. I mean, I’m a diva. Who lives like this? But in spite of everything I had fun and I’m proud of myself. Jeff: Stacey, your adventure has come to an end. Okay. Jeff: It's time for you to go. Good job, Stacey. Don't even say anything. Bye, girls. Y'all stay strong, okay. Strong woman. Thank you. Jeff: Bye, Stacey. Jeff: Christine, once again you seized the moment. You stayed alive on Redemption Island. Head back to camp and await your next duel. Thank you. Jeff: Congrats. Good job, girl. Good job. Thanks, hope to see you soon. Hang in there. Jeff: All right, guys, head back to camp. What you share with the rest of your tribe mates, up to you. Benjamin's been doing everything and Albert is his right-hand man. Those were things I thought we would be able to keep under the radar pretty  well. It just pisses me off because it makes us look bad in front of the other  tribe and I know Coach is going to be pissed. Hey, guys. Howdie. Hey. What's up? How was it? Bad? It was bad, dude. Stacey, she said we're all liars. She said that you, Sophie, myself were controlling stuff. That's disgusting. Stacey just went on a rampage. Really. Benjamin is running the tribe. Benjamin. Who's benjamin? You're not Coach, you're benjamin. Jeff is like you refuse to dignify him as Coach. He's benjamin. If anybody calls me benjamin to my face i'll go nuts. My parents call me Coach. I've been called Coach since I was 18. Stacey just went on a rant. Stacey said Coach is running the show, so now at the merge I’m probably going  to be hit number one. It just ruins my day. It suction. Could this day get request worse? Feeling good? Cool. Yew like my little omen. I like that. The alliance between me, Ozzy, Keith, Jim, and Whitney is still pretty strong. We haven't even had to talk about the vote and what it will come down to at  the next tribal council, which is great if you're one of us. Then there's Ozzy and myself, and I’m kind of just following his lead. I believe he can take me far in the game and I think we see the game the same  way. We feel the same way about the alliance, about the merge, about making it far. We're pals. Trip, cho-cho man. Good stuff. I'm the little engine that could, man. The little Cochran that could. Yeah, the little Cochran that could. The little Cochran that could. Hodo you spell that, c-o-c-h. You won't have to spell that any time soon. Don't worry about the spelling, man. Don't worry about the phonetics or anything. Keep my name as far off your fingers and your tongue as possible. They are. I work my ass off around camp, even though I’m not a big provider like Ozzy  or anybody. I'm working hard, and then to see as youy and Elyse sleeping in every single  day, they're wrapped up in their love blanket well into the early-- or late  morning. I find every little thing about them irritating now. You're a good guy. We're back! We're home! Ready? What do you think? Who was voted out? My guess, puppet dress. They voted state stacy out purple dress! Yes. I really thought they would go for weak but they're going for team Coach. Anybody who wasn't with Coach is going out. Coach is running the showy. Actually, they called him benjamin. She's like, watch out. Benjamin is in charge, Albert, Sophie. It's not unified. It's not-- yeah. Basically they're all like his puppets. Coach, Albert. If Coach is stock Market he'll get rid of Albert soon. I think Albert and he are aligned. Why would he get ride of Albert? If they get rid of Albert-- before the herm. Ozzy made one big mistake. He revealed if he were Coach he would get rid of Albert. That's huge information because if Ozzy is saying Coach should get one of the  stronger people on his tribe, that's saying Ozzy should get rid of one of the  stronger people on his side. The two strong people are me and Keith. Stay humble, positive, unified. Once I heard that, I knew what I had. Nothing sells like fear. I'm going to put that fear in Keith tell him to get Elyse gone next. The duel was definitely painful to hear some of the things that were said--  not painful personally but painful towards my cause. Despite how stase senot the sharpest tool in the shed she still said Coach  and are running things and I’m going to have a target on my back once we go  to the merge. They're going to try it get me out because they're going to see me as a  threat. That clue is still out there and that idol is still out there. I need to find it now. The clue! Good stuff right here. "it's definitely near the jungle, somewhere by the beach. The important thing to realize is it's just barely out of reach. You could stay dry if the tide is right, but you'll need to climb to have  idol in sight." good things are happening. The clue kind of told me the location of the idol is somewhere on the beach,  where the tide comes in kind of high, and it's somewhere up out of reach in  the tree. One by one, I’m going tree after tree after tree. The more I’m looking, I’m starting to get a little flustered. So I figured I can kill two birds with one stone. I can kind of furnish garner Coach and Sophie's trust by leteg them in on  this idol and I can also have them be helpers for me to find the idol because  frankly I think I can't do this by myself. I found a clue to the second idol, and I know that it's in a tree. It's high. And it's by the beach. I'm only going to tell you two because I trust you two the most. This is a huge game changer. Yeah, it is huge. Albert couldn't find the hidden immunity idol but he's found a clue. He didn't want to tell the whole alliance so only the three of us know about  the clue, Albert, Sophie and i. It will be our little secret. I checked this tree and this tree. I checked two trees over there but I can't find the idol. It definitely said in a tree? It says out of reach. You want to do a job right, you do it yourself. So I just said to myself i've got to take this into my own hands. Ow! Maybe I’m going about this the wrong way. I don't troops in it's your will that I find the hidden immunity idol and I beg  you to let me find it today. Come on, baby. Come to me. This has got to be it. Ask and you shall receive. Coach wade has found the hidden immunity idol, and lo and behold, look what  we have here. A golden little gem for Coach wade to hold on to. I mean, seriously, are the stars alining for Coach or what? This is the most exciting moment in 67 days for Coach playing this game. Moment of truth. We've got this game by the balls, guy. This morning I thought to myself, could this day get any worse? But now Coach is a happy man. Things couldn't be going better. I have to get ahold of myself and say dragon, just get back in there. I'm just so happy I’m playing the game with you two. Can't go too crazy. I'm not running the show, but at the moment, pretty close. Âª âª are you ready to do this? Let's do it, man. The ocean is my canvas, and the fish are my palette. I don't really have any outdoorsy skills, but I figure, you know, I gotta  step up. I'm slightly nervous going on the boat for the first time because I bring  zero experience, zero ability, and zero confidence. So we sit on the left? On the right. I'm not going to be able to prove anything towards being able to catch fish. That's left to Ozzy. But I hope this will be a bonding experience so that I’m not viewed as one of  the girls who hangs around camp while the true men go out fishing. I think my reputation in "Survivor" is i've been the guy that has  been able to go out and hunt fish and provide people with sustenance, but  fishing's not easy. It might look easy to somebody watching at home, put it really is very  difficult, and it takes a lot out of me. I get cut up all the time. Just the fact that i've got to hold my breath continuously and sort of stay  in one position. It's almost like underwater yoga. It's very difficult. Nice! Nice! I'm totally happy to play the provider role, and I think it's going to put me  in a stronger position than anyone else. It's like I feel like they're really becoming my tribe. Oh, ya! Holy crap! Awesome, wow. Yeah, we got 11. Holy crap. Having watched "cook islands" and "fans versus favorites"  you see Ozzy as kind of superhuman guy that can do no wrong, but Ozzy, it's  this middle aged Ozzy who has a few moments of glory each day where he runs  out and gets us some fish but otherwise, he's kind of a lazy ass. He's packaging the arrogant fisher boy, jungle boy, who feels like he can do  no wrong and that he's entitled to our deference. The more he acts like this, it's going to come back to bite him in the ass. Jeff: Come on in, guys! Jeff: Come on in, guys! Rick, big reaction seeing that pig. That's nice! [ laughter ] jeff: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? Yeah. Yeah. Jeff: First things first, Dawn, I must take it back. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, each tribe will have a roasted pig on a spit. With your hands tied behind your back, you will race to chew off as much meat  as you can. You may be tempted to eat it. But if you want to win, put it in the basket. The tribe that spits the most meat in their basket at the end of 10 minutes  wins immunity. In addition, the winning tribe earns reward [ applause ] is that bread? Jeff: Veggies, spices, big loaf of bread. We want some carbs, man. We gotta have some. Jeff: In addition, the winning tribe will have another hidden clue waiting  for them back at camp. Find the clue, that will help you find the hidden idol. Worth playing for. Yeah. Oh, yeah! Jeff: All right, give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right, here we go. For immunity and reward, Survivors ready? Go! Any way you can get that meat off using your mouth, and then wring it back  and spit it in the basket. It will be little pieces in the beginning, and then probably bigger pieces  toward the end as you start working. Come on, guys! Big one, big one! Double time, guys, come on! Jeff: Cochran getting in there. Elyse getting in there. Coach's face covered in sauce. Everybody working hard in this challenge. Dawn with a big hunk of meat. The entire Upolu tribe coming back with a mouth full. Coach gnawing off something big. That meat is stuck in Keith's teeth. He can't get it out. Dawn going to pull it out. That is team work right there! Brandon back for more. Ozzy trying to get in there and get deep, trying to get something big going. So good! Good job, guys! Jeff: Rick with a huge piece of meat. Come oall the way! All the way, guys, all the way! Jeff: Elyse, wow! Albert almost knocks over his entire tribe's basket. That was disgusting, Jim Edna has meat stuck in her mouth. Coach has to rip it out. Somebody rip this. Jeff: Now Brandon can't get his out. Rick pulls it out. Thank you, Rick. Jeff: Both tribes getting to know each other in a whole new way. New way. This is a disgusting challenge. Out of my mouth, out of my mouth. Jeff: Brandon needs to floss. 30 seconds left! Both tribes getting a lot of meat off of this pig. Rick drops one on the ground. Is he going to leave it? He's leaving it! Mikayla will pick it up. She's not too proud. We are very close. Come oeverybody get a bite and go. Get a bite and go. Jeff: 15 seconds. Savaii needs something big right now. Jim with a huge piece of meat at the end! That will makey a difference in this challenge. Five seconds left, four, three, two, one, we're done! Pull away! Pull away! Let go, Ozzy. Let go. Whatever is in your mouth, put in your basket, then walk away. Somebody has to get this out of my teeth. Jeff: Ozzy gives Cochran a nice little kiss to get that last little bit and  this might be very close. Drum roll on Sophie's back. Jeff: Start with Savaii. Past the 10 pounds. That's a lot of meat, folks. That is a lot of meat. Jeff: Past the 20 pounds. We're at 22 pounds, 12 ounces for Savaii. [ applause ] there's 10 pounds. There's 20 pounds. No way. 22 pound, 12 ounces is the Mark to beat. 22 pounds, 14 ounces. Upolu wins immunity and reward by two ounces. Whooo! No, way. Jeff: Upolu, congratulations. Hard fought challenge. No tribal council tonight. In addition, nice reward to take with you back to camp. And another clue to the location of a hidden idol will be waiting for you  back at camp. It is hidden as well. In addition, because you won, you can take home all the meat you collected. You better believe it, baby! Jeff: Come get your reward. We'll fry the meat up and get all the spit off it and we'll be good. Wash all the spit off and cow down! That's so awesome. This ain't no joke. That was crazy close. Jeff: All right, Savaii, tribal council tonight. Somebody will be voted out of this tribe and sent to Redemption Island. Grab your stuff. Head back. I will see you at tribal tonight. He's all business. Look at him. Watching my dad and my mom cook and my grabbed ma, a bunch of cajuns, man. They just cook, cook, cook. All right, guys, the food is ready. There are a lot ofs of ups and downs just in general in the game of "Survivor."  today was positive energy, man. I believe we're a team and a family. Oh, my gosh! This is so good. What do you think buddy? The taste of victory, man! I'm going crazy right now I’m so excited. The best thing about today's challenge-- beep-beep-- we're back in the  driver's seat, baby. We own it now. I mean, this is freaking unbelievable, man. In all honesty the whole back side of one of my molars is gone. It just came down to team mouth and volume size. My lips hurt so bad. Yeah, we're all going to have pig gut breakout tomorrow on our skin. We're probably also gog have oral herpes. What? ! What? I'm sure somebody does. Doesn't everybody have herpes? What! Don't 99% of human beings have herpes. Okay, harvard. I don't think so. Getting a cold sore, that's herpes. I have never had a cold sore. You're not living, then. You're telling uss you just gave us cold sores? No I’m saying I’m going to get it from one of you. Anybody want me to open a coconut? I'm getting good at it. He's trying so hard. I know. Anybody wants this coconut? No. Is there juice in it? Tons in it. I'll take a little sip. Ozzy, you want any? As soon as we got back from the challenge, Cochran definitely made a point of  putting on a display of working. I'm trying to prove my worth one way or another. He worked harder than i've seen him work the whole time out here. It just sucks it's too late. You know. I think pretty much everybody on the tribe feels he is the weakest link, and  I think everybody feels good about letting him go tonight. So that's the plan, right? It's Cochran. Okay. Ozzy's pretty clear that he wants Cochran gone, but in my opinion, it's time  to break up that alliance with Ozzy and Elyse. Right now, I think you, me, and Jim are all on the same page in terms of  wanting to get rid of Elyse next. Right, Elyse has to go. She's fine with Elyse first. I mean, you know who the linchpin is going to be is Keith. Really? Yeah. Okay. I feel like I have Cochran and Dawn but in a tribe of seven, you need four. I gotta find that fourth vote to get Elyse out. I gotta talk to you about something that came up that I didn't like. Something kind of big, actually. It raised my eyebrows a lot. The only thing good that came out of the Redemption Island information is I got  a piece of fear they can plant in Keith to help him vote with me against Elyse  tonight. Ozzy is talking about Coach needs to get out Albert beforehand. And I’m like-- so, immediately, if he's thinking that Coach needs to get out Albert,  that means he's thinking he needs to get out one of us premerge. And I don't-- here's the thing, he can't do it-- like Cochran is driving me  freaking crazy. I know,. But if we get rid of Elyse first, he can't do anything. I know. I agree. We need Elyse first gone. Keith and I get on the same page within about 30 seconds. So it's looking pretty strongly like Elyse is next. Then what happens? I don't think we tell Ozzy. But then he's not going to trust us. Tonight's vote is supposed to go Jim, Dawn, Cochran, and they vote Elyse, and  then Elyse and Ozzy are going to vote for Cochran. So that leaves me and Whitney for a little room to play. We gotta do that. Because then we can kind of do whatever we want. The first alliance I made was me and Ozzy, so tonight's vote is going to be  really scary because Elyse gets blindsided, in a sense, Ozzy gets blindsided. So how is Ozzy going to trust me when he thinks we're all voting for Cochran? That's the question that I’m going to have to try to figure out. And you're, like, 100% thinking we should go with Elyse now? Yes, no, I don't know. Yeah, I just want to make sure that we've thought everything through. Elyse and Ozzy are like this. And I don't think Ozzy's going to like it if we all vote her off, and there  goes our alliance. So Ozzy wants Cochran right now. What one so bad if we voted Cochran out? I don't know. So is it better to get Elyse out now or later? I don't know. Keith I are still trying to figure out how to weasel our way around this and  still come out in our alliance with Ozzy. It's hard. I wish we could let those three vote for Elyse and us two vote not Cochran,  just someone else. We're all good. Elyse is next. Really? Yeah, yeah. Seriously? 100%. Really? For the first time I’m not feeling that bad about my chances going into  tonight's tribal. Worst-case scenario, I get sent to Redemption Island. But I really don't want to get sent to redemption. I don't think if Ozzy thinks we are all against him. We are all against him. He will be against me when we vote out his hammock sweetheart. Which is what I hope will happen tonight. Y jeff: Ozzy, we're 14 days in, roughly a third of the way into the adventure. Having played twice before, where are we at right now from a game point of  view? You know, a third of the way in, merge is still too far off to be that  worried about in terms of the trust of the group. So it's all about keeping us a strong as possible. Jeff: Elyse, how do you define a strong tribe member? I think in this game a strong tribe member is somebody who is strong across  the board. So somebody who can deliver what they're expected in a challenge. Somebody who can contribute around camp life. Somebody who has got social skills and graces that can help unify people,  keeping the group together. Jeff: Cochran, you've gotten votes every time we've been at tribal council. Right. Jeff: When you hear Elyse say I want somebody strong. Does your antenna go up thinking am I once again going to be getting votes  because my legs aren't tree trunks? Yeah, the novelty of attending tribal council has worn off for me. In terms of challenges, challenges run such a huge gamut of things. I think we all did a fantastic job at today's challenge. It came down to two ounces. That made it especially devastating. Jeff: Two ounces is one extra wight. Jim, was there any going back over thinking-- every success one of us did  because we all say we gave 100% but then it's like woulda-could-a-should-a. This was one where ironically enough we all had more injuries during this  challenge than any of our other challenges combined. Jeff: Give me the rundown. Who has an injury. From today's challenge? From today's challenge. Jeff: Jim, what's your injury. I have a bun of cuts in my mouth. Jeff: Elyse. Cuts. Jeff: Dawn. Broken tooth. Jeff: Whitney? Just lips. Jeff: Cochran. I haven't been wearing my retainer as a should have been. I definitely felt my teeth shifting. Jeff: Cochran, are you being silly or are you 100% sincere. I'm warping the arrangement of my teeth. Jeff: Smile, let me see. That's not a smile. It's a grimace, but... Jeff: Dawn, Cochran's need to assess and reassess,  that's not a smile, that's a grimace. Highway often is that charming and how often is it annoying? I think Cochran's endearing. He's a little bit of a character to me, but I think this is also a game about  bringing people together that would never be together. So part of me is learning to be really tolerant. Like today when we came back from the challenge, he said there's a  possibility we could have some communicable disease because we all had our  mouths against the spit. And I just thought I don't know where you get that. It was just hilarious but not. Jeff: Keith, everybody else was kind of laughing. You had a different reaction. Yeah, it was nasty. I don't want a supposed disease from someone else's mouth. Yeah, the intentions were to maybe make everyone laugh, but I think in the  end, yeah, it grossed everyone out. Jeff: Cochran, you can't catch a break. It's horrible. It's-- it's devastating. I know these are kind of light-hearted comments, but they do hurt. I mean tribal council is always like next time I’m going to be better. I could obsess about everything I do out here-- and probably will tonight. I probably will tonight if there is a tonight. Jeff: Elyse, can you feel for somebody like Cochran? Oh, I can completely feel for Cochran. I know that it's hard to be in a position where people are looking at you and  pointing out things that you don't want to hear. I mean, we've all been in that position. We've all been picked last for soccer out on the playground, you know. Jeff: Cochran, are you typically picked last for soccer? I don't put myself in a position where I’m playing soccer. [ laughter ]. But all theneroses and self-dep raication aside, I think I get along well  with people. I may have certain quirks that people find acnig, but that aside, I think  people, or at least a good number of people, do take to me. Jeff: Elyse, given everything that Cochran's gone through, the last two  tribal councils and again tonight, would it be hard to vote him out? One thing to appreciate about him is that he so loves and knows the game that  whether he stays, whether he goes to Redemption Island, he's going to  appreciate the experience. Jeff: Jim, is there anything about the vote that's personal or is it  absolutely strategy? You know, there's always a personal element to it. So even when I go back there and write down a name that's in my mind 100%  strategic, it's still personal because I know how it's going to affect that  person when they see their name on there. Jeff: Okay, it is time to vote. Jim, you're up. Sorry, Elyse, this has more to do with keeping Ozzy weak. This is the second-to history last stop on the train. Sorry, man. Hope you get that second chance. Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Cochran. Elyse. Cochran. That's two votes Cochran, one vote Elyse. Elyse. We're tied, two votes Cochran, two votes Elyse. Dawn. One vote Dawn. Dawn, we're tied. Two votes Dawn, two votes Cochran, two votes Elyse, one vote left. Fifth person voted out of "Survivor: South Pacific" Elyse. You need to bring me your torch. Elyse, the tribe has spoken. You will have a chance to get back in this game. Grab your torch. Head to Redemption Island. Good luck. Judging from the look on Elyse's face, i'd say that was your first blindside. In this game just took a big turn. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. Captioning brought to you by Survivor productions, cbs, captioned by media  access group at wgbh access.wgbh.org jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our  next episode. Jeff: Next time on "Survivor": Brandon looks like Russell. I'm having flash backs it scares the heck for me. I'll play for myself. And you guys can play for yourself. I'm what I call a free agent.
