<br/>Wardog, like, I just felt like there was a lot of lies and  schemes going on from him that I wasn't--  Keep being honest with this guy. <br/>That I didn't respect. <br/> Keep being honest with this guy. Tribal council did not go according to my plan. Wardog gets voted out. I felt like I had a great relationship with Ron, but this is the  second time he's lied to me and gotten rid of someone I work with. So I'm in a desperate situation right now. <br/>Would you talk to me for a minute? <br/>Yeah, absolutely, man. <br/>After we vote out Wardog, everyone is happy with me except  for devons because I've lied to him every tribal. So I have to do something to bring him back closer. My goal has been to make everyone think I'm working with them,  because when everyone thinks you're on their side, they're not going to vote  you out. The five of them are voting you out next. <br/>Yeah. <br/>They, they are, but I have an idol. I found this secret advantage on the very first day on the boat  that we arrived in. It's expired. But he doesn't need to know that. I'm just going to give to you to show you I'm loyal and you can  trust me. <br/>Oh, are you serious? <br/>It meant a lot to him. And now he may relax thinking that he's safe. Then we'll be able to take advantage of him and send him home. <br/>So Ron gives me this little menu, which plays just leak a  regular hidden immunity idol. Not too shabby. I honestly don't know why Ron would give this to me. Like, totally confused. Thanks, man. <br/>No problem. <br/>I hope that I don't have to rely on this advantage, so I  need to keep trying to play as hardaise can. But I'm optimistic. I'm the phoenix, and I keep rising from the ashes. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Jeff: All right, let's get to today's reward challenge. Last time we ran this challenge was nearly a decade ago. "Survivor: Heroes versus villains." players and their  loved ones. Challenge is good to go. All we're missing is is the loved ones. Cue the music. Devens, here's your wife, becca. Come on out. <br/>She's gorgeous. <br/>She is gorgeous, isn't she. <br/>Oh, my God! Your beard! You look great! <br/>You look great. <br/>Jeff put the immunity necklace on me yesterday? <br/>Are you serious! <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: So, becca, what's it like for you back home? <br/>Our son, jack, he doesn't know where Rick is. He asks about him, but he's not, like, freaking out. Nobody is freaking out. <br/>Jeff: Does that trigger you at all when she brings up your  son and he doesn't know where you are. <br/>Halfway into the game that was a devastating thing to  think about, but now, down the home stretch, jack is going to see Jeff put  the immunity necklace on me. It's going to be awesome. It's going to be really special. They only give me strength now. <br/>Jeff: All right, give him a big hug. <br/>I love you. <br/>I love you, too. <br/>Jeff: Julie, are you ready for some love? Get your husband out here. Mark, come on out. <br/>Are you okay? <br/>I'm good. How about you? <br/>Jeff: She asks if he's okay. <br/>Oh, my God. I'm so proud of you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Julie, is a big part of the reason you're out here  is just a test for yourself? <br/>Absolutely. I've been saying it since day one, I want to push myself to the  limits and prove to myself, like, I know I have this ininner strength they  don't always show back at home to the people I'm with. But I think the biggest thing is that I underestimate myself. <br/>Jeff: Do you think that's changing? <br/>For sure. You don't even realize how much I've changed. Like, I feel like I'm going to be a different person when I get  back. Like, I just feel like I'm going to be a better wife and mother. <br/>You're pretty great. You don't to worry about it. <br/>Jeff: All right, mark, give her a big hug. Lawreb, are you ready for some love? Here's your dad, Joey. Here's your dad, Joey. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, I don't want to does what you whispered in  your dad's eerk but what's the essence of the communication comoouks? Is that you need him to know you're okay or you need him to make  you okay? <br/>I think it's a little of both. My dad is my rock. I mean, he's been through everything with me. And it's just been the hardest thing ever not having him here. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, if I didn't say anything, how long would you  stand there hugging your dad like that? <br/>Forever. <br/>Jeff: Forever. All right, give her one last hug. <br/>I love you so much. <br/>I love you, baby. I'm so proud of you. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Let's have fun. <br/>Jeff: Ron, let's get your husband out here. <br/>Oh, my God. Lloyd, come on out! Let's see who married you. <br/>Oh, man! <br/>I missed you so much. <br/>I missed you, too. How's mom and dad? <br/>They're good. Everybody's good. <br/>Jeff: Ron, describe the comfort, when you can fall into  the arms of your partner, knowing it's safe? <br/>I mean, he's my protector. It's because of him that I can do stuff like this because he  makes me feel so safe. It's just an amazing feeling to have someone in your life, no  matter what you want to do they say, gfor it." they're cheering for you  100%. <br/>Jeff: That's huge. <br/>You have facial hair? <br/>You like it. These are my friends. These are my new friends. <br/>He's even better looking than you said he was. This is great. <br/>I love our life. And I'm never going to take it for granted. <br/>Jeff: All right, lloyd, give him a big hug. <br/>Of course. <br/>You're doing well, babe. <br/>Jeff: Victoria, you ready for some love? <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: Let's get your dad out here. Rock, come on out! <br/>I miss you so much. Let me look at you. <br/>Don't I look crazy? <br/>No. You look like a freckle. <br/>You smell good. <br/>"You smell good."  Bug spray. [ laughter ]  Jeff: Victoria, walk me through your "Survivor"  experience. When did you first start watching? <br/>I started watching when I was like six years old with my  whole family, and my dad is just as big a fan as I am so I was just dying to  get to this moment so we could have it together. Every other time I've cried in this game is thinking about this  moment. And it just makes me a different person. I can't pretend that I'm, like, cold anymore. <br/>She's tough. She's best. <br/>Jeff: Oh! Can't hear anything better from your dad. <br/>No. <br/>Jeff: All right, give her a last hug, rock. <br/>Oh, baby. I love you. <br/>I love you, too. <br/>Jeff: Aurora, somebody here for you. Let's get your brother out here, shane. [ applause ]  Jeff: That's a hug. <br/>Jeff: Tell me about your brother, Aurora. <br/>Like, I wouldn't be the person I am today without him. I wouldn't have the opportunities I have. I wouldn't have anything without him. He has been my brother, my father, my protector. <br/>Jeff: Wow. <br/>Everything I do, I think of what-- making sure I make him  proud, and that every day I'm the person he thought I could be. <br/>And beyond what I thought you could be. <br/>Jeff: All right, give him a big hug. <br/>Stay stRong. [ applause ]  Jeff: Gavin, you ready for some love? Wow! Gavin doesn't cry. <br/>No one else knows, but I was supposed to get married a  week after "Survivor" started, and carly moved up the wedding so I  could come out here, so we got married two days before. <br/>Jeff: So it seems only fitting that she gets to share in  this with you. Carly, come on out. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>I missed you so much. I'm glad you're here. <br/>I love you. <br/>I love you. <br/>Oh, my God. I look awful, don't I? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I left. <br/>Oh, my gosh, two days before. <br/>Jeff: Carroll, what's it like for to you have a new  husband, and then he leaves? <br/>It's so overwhelming to have him leave, you know, right  after. It was so hard. But--  So this is our honeymoon. [ laughter ] ever since we started dating, she knows I've been a  fan of "Survivor," and, like, that's been my dream. But now that I'm out here all I can think about is getting back  home to her. <br/>He talks about you all the time. <br/>Every day. <br/>This is my dream. This is-- "Survivor" is great, but, like, this is it. I couldn't ask for anything more. <br/>Jeff: Well said. All right, give her a last hug. [ applause ]  Congratulations, guys. On the wedding. <br/>Jeff: All right, let's get to the challenge. By the way, in case you haven't figured it out, you are  participating. So pay attention. Here's how it's going to work. On my "Go" you're going to race down with a bucket,  scoop up water from the ocean, race back, attempt to toss it to your loved  one, who will try to catch it and put it in their bucket. First pair to fill their bucket and raise their flag wins  reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: It's as close to home as you can get while playing  "Survivor." your loved ones back at your camp with a "Survivor"  picnic, fried chicken and apple pie for dessert. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: Find your partners. We'll get started. <br/>Jeff: All right. Here we go. For reward in the form of love, Survivors ready? Go! It is a race to the ocean. You're looking to put water in that bucket and transfer it to  your loved one's bucket. It's going to be Aurora and Gavin back first. Big toss, but not much in there. Nice toss from Gavin to carly. What a honeymoon gift this would be to win this challenge. Here comes Lauren. And a nice catch by dad. Victoria comes up short. Devens to his wife. Drenches his wife. Not much in the bucket. Here goes Julie toward mark. Not bad. Ron with a nices to. Gavin to carroll again. <br/>That was good! <br/>Jeff: Carly with a nice catch. <br/>A little bit straighter. <br/>Jeff: Aurora to shane, her. <br/>Sorry. <br/>A little bit of water. Here comes Lauren. <br/>Big toss. <br/>Yup. <br/>Jeff: Love on the line. And a nice catch by dad, who is getting wet. <br/>Let's go, babe. <br/>Jeff: Ron with another nice toss. Devens to his wife. <br/>Good one! <br/>Jeff: Once again, I don't know if Devens is doing that on  purpose or not, becca. <br/>He is. Victoria struggling even to get back. <br/>Can't breathe. <br/>Jeff: Victoria is exhausted. How badly do you want the love. Aurora to shane, her brother. <br/>Dang it! <br/>Jeff: That's not even worth the run. Julie, either laughing or crying. <br/>Hyperventilating! <br/>You got it. <br/>Jeff: Every time you run down to that beach, it is taking  a toll. <br/>Sorry! <br/>How's it going, babe? <br/>Good, aerve's good. And I miss you. <br/>I miss you, too. You're doing great. <br/>Jeff: Nice toss from Ron. Once you start seeing that bucket start to lower, you know  you're on the right track. Here comes Gavin to carly again. This could end very fast. If you have a good connection. They're close. That bucket's moving. <br/>Last toss was great. <br/>Jeff: Lauren with a nice toss to her dad. You are getting close. The toss to lloyd. How much did he get? Not bad. Every little bit helps. That could do it. Ron and lloyd win reward! <br/>We got it! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>We got halfway. <br/>You don't even really smell bad. <br/>Thanks for the compliment. <br/>Jeff: All right, so, you're going back to camp with lloyd. "Survivor" picnic. Now comes the tough part. Who are you going to bring with you? Six pairs of loved ones. Everybody has their eyes you. Pick one player and their loved one to join you. <br/>I love everybody over there. But I'm going to pick Julie. <br/>Jeff: Okay, Julie, come on over. All right, you get to pick one more pair. Big political decision. Games have been won and losta this point in the game. <br/>I know. They really broke my heart what I heard a little while ago and I  think they need a proper honeymoon, so I'm going to pick Gavin. <br/>Jeff: Gavin and carly, come on over. [ applause ] all right, Survivors, say goodbye to your loved  ones. Time for them to go. <br/>I love you so much. <br/>Bye. <br/>I love you, babe. <br/>I love you. <br/>Jeff: Devens, Lauren, Victoria, Aurora, got nothing for  you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Enjoy. <br/>Seeing someone as important as my dad and to have it taken  away, it just sucks. And it absolutely makes me think twice about, you know, what  kind of relationship I have with Ron, what kind of strategy he's really  playing. If there's ever an award where picking someone is crucial it's  the loved one's visit. You who pick can make our break your game. <br/>Ron, first of all, thank you. <br/>Thank you, Ron. <br/>Yeah, thank you, Ron. <br/>Congratulations on your honeymoon. <br/>This is lovely! <br/>Wait, first of all, how was the talent show? <br/>Amazing. They rocked it. They did great. <br/>I'm eating everything. I'm eating everything. <br/>I just can't wait to get back and experience the married  life. I'm so excited. <br/>You are so close. Like, you have so much to be proud of. <br/>Ron came through in the clutch, and he picked me for this  family visit. I mean, I am super grateful to him. <br/>Gavin has talked about you every day all day. <br/>Oh! <br/>Luckily, carly supports my dream. But deep down, I still feel like who doesn't go on their honeymoon  because of "Survivor." carly wrote in our vow books, "Part of  me is leaving"... Sorry. "A part of me is leaving with you on the plane." it's  like, "Yeah, like, I-- I have so much to play for. I love you so much. <br/>I have played double agent and double-double agent. I have lied. <br/>I bet. <br/>I have cheated. <br/>It's a part of the game. <br/>I've manipulated so many people. <br/>You're still here, right? <br/>I'm in charge of this game. <br/>Right. <br/>But they're so loyal. I mean, part of the game is picking people so that they think  you trust them. I wanted to get the maximum impact out of my picks. I want to make sure I have jewel nemy pocket. And then I picked Gavin. It had nothing to do with the honeymoon. That wouldn't have suede my decision. I need Gavin to be locked in, and now to give him that  experience with his new bride, it's a powerful gift. What are the three of us doing? <br/>If Rick doesn't win immunity attorney general it's Rick. <br/>There you go. <br/>His butt's got to go. In the best in my life telling lloyd, "I did this. I did that." and he kept saying to me, "Do what you  gotta do. Win this game." so it's made me focus even more. <br/>Bye, guys! Bye! <br/>We're a great team. He balances me and he supports me and it works beautifully  together. <br/>He is trying to make everyone paranoid right now. <br/>Maybe somebody sent him a clue. <br/>But if you had a clue, if you already had it -- go through  it. Go through it. <br/>All right. <br/>All right. <br/>Why are you looking in my bag? <br/>Because you're walk around looking for an idol. It's allowed in the game. I just can't look--  I know it's allowed. <br/>What was I just saying. <br/>August ward! <br/>Not really. I'm good. <br/>I feel like I would feel awkward if I got caught looking  through someone's bag. <br/>No. <br/>That's okay. <br/>So I'm out searching for the idol again, and I go back to  camp, and I see Aurora closing the flap of my bag, and she's busted. But she didn't even hide it. She don't give a damn about nothing. <br/>It's nothing against you, Rick. I'm just looking. <br/>Oh, I know. You just got caught. <br/>I know, and I'm totally fine with it, dude. <br/>I know. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I didn't say anything. Find anything good? <br/>No. Not really. <br/>You didn't look very hard. Thank God Aurora didn't find the advantage Ron gave me. But I also want to make it awkward in camp. I want to let everyone know Aurora's going through bags. Can we trust Aurora? <br/>Yeah, they're look through bags. Watch your bags. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Whatever. <br/>Maybe don't keep the one I gave you in your bag. <br/>I'm not leaving my bag anymore. I'll tell you that. I'm taking it everywhere. Now that everyone thinks I'm searching for an idol, I'm going to  search for an idol. I've been searching all day. It's a pain, man. I looked all over the place and I can't find anything. But if there's an idol out here for me to find, I'm going to put  in the work. This is my second chance, because I came back from "The  edge." if I go for it, there's nothing I can't do. Oh, my God! You must be kidding me. "Congratulations. You found the clue to a hidden immunity idol. It will require you to be daring. It rests in the trees above your shelter. Good luck." oh! I don't even need it to be a secret. I'm going to go get it right now. No. I won't. Oh, I want it in my possession so bad. But I don't want them ton I have it. I want to have options with this baby. I mean, this could be a million-dollar find. I might have just stumbled across a million dollars in that  tree. I just have to scope it out. Where I think it is. Holy crap! This thing is, like, 15 feet in the air above camp. And I don't even like heights. So things are a lot more complicated than I thought they were. That's really hard. Camp is so rarely totally empty. Nice job, guys! I'm just gog force myself to be patient. It's a grind, man. "Survivor" is a grind, and I'm grinding. <br/>In the middle of the night, it's dark, with everyone  sleeping. It's now or never. I'm getting that idol. That's easier said than dan d.N.A. Because it is 15 feet in the air in the middle of our camp. I'm going for it. I'm going to climb this tree like a ninja, get it, and get the  hell out of dodge. I gotta do this fast. I gotta try to be quiet. I'm halfway up. My belt gets stuck on this other tree. Come oman! Come on! I'm trying to do this very quietly. And I'm still making noise. On the shelter, you know, the bamboo rubbing against each other. I finally reach for the gap and I'm feeling, feeling. And I feel something solid. And I know it's the idol. I get it in my pocket, and down the tree, man. Got away with the loot. Scot free. No one even knows they were robbed. Stealth mission a success. While everyone else is sleeping, I'm working. And it pays off. This is my salvation in the game. They searched my bag too soon. [ laughs ] I have what Ron gave me. Now I have this. They don't know what's coming for them. I'm on top of the moon. <br/>Jeff: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to use your arms to brace  yourself between two walls while your fleetfeet are perched on very narrow  footholds. When you drop, you're out. Last person left standing wins immunity, safe tonight at the  vote. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. Here we go. All right, let's begin this immunity challenge. This is the challenge where you just have to outlast the others. You don't think about getting down. You just wait for them to drop one by one. <br/>Holy moly. <br/>You guys give me this, I promise, every one of you, final  three. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Lauren what, do you think of that offer? <br/>It sounds like Devens can't do math. <br/>She's not wRong. <br/>Jeff: This is a challenge that's going to really test how  you're feeling nonetheless game right now. It's really just will power. Ron's shaking his head no. I disagree. Ron says no, it's not will power. It's just pain. <br/>It's pain. Devens with no warning drops and is out. No shot at immunity. Vulnerable tonight at tribal council, which is never good. <br/>Especially when they told you it's going to be you  tonight. <br/>Yup. And I say as soon as I'm going, Aurora, you're going to be a  huge target. You've won two immunitys. That doesn't make you uncomfortable? <br/>I'm always uncomfortable, but right now, I'm pretty good. You know, he knows we all love him, but we've been flat-out  honest. He's got to go. <br/>Thank you. [ laughs ]  Jeff: And Ron, right after Devens, drops. 21 minutes into this challenge. <br/>You guys are doing good. <br/>Well. <br/>You guys are doing well. I did a lot of walking around today. <br/>Find anything? <br/>No. What do you want to go for tonight? <br/>Maybe Aurora. <br/>Okay. That's what I'm gonna do. <br/>Jeff: Been up there 33 minutes. Victoria steps out of the challenge with zero warning. <br/>You saw my leg? <br/>I'm done. I'm done. <br/>Jeff: Wow. Julie announces it and goes to her knees. <br/>You okay, honey? <br/>Jeff: Julie feeling not only 31 days but 33 minutes of  this challenge. Ron going to go over and help. <br/>I'm fine. <br/>Good job, Julie. <br/>I can't walk. Oh, my God! [ laughs ]. <br/>Oh, it's been fun. <br/>Jeff: Oh, wow "It's been fun," and Aurora steps out. She can't walk. And we are left with Lauren right next to Gavin. Been up there 50 minutes. Both players trying to push through what is clearly immense  pain. There is no relief. Everything hurts. Lauren and Gavin fighting for immunity. Lauren can't hold on. Lauren drops. Gavin wins his second individual immunity, safe tonight at  tribal council. Come here. <br/>Jeff: Gavin, nice job. <br/>Good job, Gavin. <br/>Good job, Gavin! <br/>Jeff: Gavin, safe tonight at tribal council. Cannot be voted out of this game. As for the rest of you, see you tonight at tribal council where  somebody will be voted out of the game. <br/>The immunity challenge didn't go as well. I fell out early. On the other hand, it was perfect because Devens fell out first  and he's the one we want to send home. The only thing he's going to tribal with tonight is that fake  advantage. He will try to play it, it won't work, and he'll be sent to the Edge  of Extinction. <br/>Good job, buddy. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Good jock, brother. <br/>Awesome. <br/>How are your feet? <br/>Killing me. <br/>The immunity challenge was a massive failure and an  embarrassment. <br/>Good work, brother man. <br/>We get back to camp, and no one is talking to me. Like, there's nothing to talk about. Like, okay, it's Rick. Easy. We should all get together. You guys want to work together? No takers? <br/>Leave it be. Leave it be. <br/>I don't think anyone wants to work with me, except for  maybe Ron, and he could be totally full of it. <br/>Okay, so, 100%, like, on board, Aurora tonight. <br/>How is it going to go down? <br/>Well, people think it's going to be you. <br/>Right. <br/>But it's not going to be you. <br/>And that's, like, real. Because I never asked for it. You're not just messing with me. <br/>Yep. <br/>Well, it would be the second time you guys saved me. So I'd be totally on board. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay, buddy. <br/>Okay, you guys go this way. I'll go that way. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>Ron! I feel terrible. <br/>There's a reason why the game is called  "Survivor."  The plan tonight is to put all the votes on Devens, but if  Devens does have a real immunity idol, his one vote would choose who goes  home. So I told Devens to vote for Aurora. <br/>We're clear. We are all voting Rick. Shoos all we need to do. <br/>Here's the deal-- Aurora, she's positioned thoars win this  game. <br/>Aurora's burned nobody. The three of us have all burned people in our original tribe. <br/>I just want to make sure we're all good before--  I'm good. <br/>I love you two. <br/>And I'm so glad us three are together. <br/>It will be a lively tribal reading of the votes. <br/>There's Rick, and then there's the backup plan if Rick has  an idol. <br/>Exactly. <br/>Tonight's vote should be simple. Even Rick knows it's Rick. The problem is we don't know if he has some kind of idol or  advantage. And at this point, we have to assume he does. If we didn't split the votes, then just whoever Rick votes for  goes home. But I want to be the one to decide who goes home. <br/>It's pretty obvious we haven't been on the same side most  of this game. I'd rather be on the same side. <br/>I feel the same way. It's gotten to the point now where I need someone that I can  trust. In my head, "This is what makes most sense. And you tell me what you think. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Devens first. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Or if Devens plays an idol, we could get out Ron. <br/>I want Ron out so badly. <br/>If Gavin knows me and you are on board, I think he'll be  more than down. Ron picking Gavin and Julie for the loved ones made it very  clear he's not working with me. So he's going to get stuck on the wRong side of the numbers  which I have no problem with. <br/>There's six of us voting Devens, but we're saying just in  case Devens plays something, Lauren and Gavin are pick Ron. <br/>I have an extra vote. This is the last time I can use it. But if you 100%, I would give Gavin the extra vote. If there's a tie and I'm the one they vote after, I lose my  ability to vote. If there's a tie where I am one of the names being written down,  I can't revote. So the only way to ensure that my additional vote will count is  to give it to Gavin because with Gavin having immunity, he's the one person  who is guaranteed to be able to vote in a revote. Which allows us to stay in control. But I'm putting a lot of faith in Gavin. I just hope I don't go down in history as one of the  "Survivor" idiots. <br/>I had a very, very long talk with Victoria and Aurora  today. They want to split the vote between Rick and Ron. In case, like, Rick plays something. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Which, honestly, Gavin, is fine with me. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Because we need Ron out, anyway. <br/>The plan for tonight is there's going to be a majority  voting for Rick Devens, and then we have to decide who's going to be the next  biggest threat, just in case Devens pulls out an idol. And they're saying it's got to be Ron, but Ron just gave me one  of the greatest days of my life yesterday, and now I'm supposed to turn  around and blindside him. <br/>Okay, so here's what's happening. I'm giving you my extra vote. <br/>Aurora has an extra vote, and she is giving it to me. Since I have immunity, then if there's a tie vote, I'm guaranteed  to vote again. I'm not sure if I want to vote for Ron and burn bridges before I  have to. I know that Ron and Julie want Aurora to be the backup plan, but  that could possibly damage the relationships I've made with Lauren and Victoria. It's a tRicky situation. I mean, it's almost like a double-edged sword. <br/>For me, tonight's tribal is about figuring out if Ron is  really with me. So the plan is to use what Ron gave me, which he says is a  hidden immunity idol, and vote Aurora out. Dun-dun-dun-duh. Redemption for Ron or a villain in our midst? Tribal will tell. And an idol ready to be played. Who will benefit, and who will go home? Stay tuned for the details. I'm Rick Devens. And that's our top story at Vata beach. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. So, Devens, today at the challenge, you were out early, you sat  down and said, "It's me tonight." do you still feel that way? <br/>Absolutely. Never a good sign when there's a shelter full of people and one  of them is going through your bag. Not a great feeling, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Who got caught? <br/>Aurora, red handed. <br/>Wow. <br/>Devens made very clear he was looking for an idol. So, he left his bag. I'm going to go through it. <br/>And I can end the speculation right now. But I won't. I'm enjoying myself. [ laughter ]. <br/>Jeff, to me it's just words. And words is not viable in this game. That's why everyone has multiple options, backups, and backups  for their backup. <br/>Jeff: Victoria, what's your take on this? <br/>If anyone had an idol, it would be Devens. He's played two different advantages in this game, and you just  always have to have a plan "B" at the very least. <br/>Jeff: Ron, are there so many plans in place that it's a  little like spinning the roulette wheel? <br/>No, it's not that random. No longer are you thinking about who you vote for today, then  when you go back to camp, you want to make sure you know who will I be  working with and what's nigh next vote? <br/>Jeff: So, are you worried tonight legitimately. <br/>I didn't hear my name today. Nobody said it to my face. Maybe behind my back. I hope I have a handle on what's happening? <br/>Jeff: Ron, walk me through the loved one challenge. You win the challenge. You choose gaffe and I know Julie to bring along. What it was it like for you after the love was over, and you  have other people back at camp that you didn't choose? <br/>I was heartbroken for Victoria and Lauren because it was  their dads, and there's a special bond between a father and a daughter. And to have them not get to have more time to experience this  with them, it was very hard for me. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, that reward is valued by everybody. But only some get it and others don't. Hue big of an impact does that have in this game? <br/>I think the people that he chose were very telling. The people that he left behind was very contingent. It totally had an impact on the game. <br/>Jeff: Gavin, is there any part of you on the receiving end  that thinks this could be a disadvantage to me, and all I did was get  selected. <br/>Yeah, I mean, it could be a disadvantage, but I was  thankful that Ron chose me, and hopefully no one held that against me. You don't know what people think in this game. <br/>Jeff: Julie, I'm always trying to find where the rhythm  is. And this season, to me, has felt like a pin ball machine where  the flippers are going, the ball's going everywhere, and you never know when  it's going to come back down or pop back up. <br/>I feel like that's a really good analogy because I've been  in multiple alliances at this point. I feel like we've all built relationships with every single  person that is sitting up here. And things could still pin ball back and forth any time in the  game. <br/>Jeff: Devens, that is hopeful when you hear Julie say,  "I've had multiple alliances."  Yeah. <br/>Jeff: That means there are relationships scattered amongst  the seven you. <br/>Absolutely. And I'm trying to find the cracks in there, but, apparently,  everyone knows something I don't. People are not having strategic talks with me. Maybe tomorrow will be different. <br/>Jeff: You can compare this to anything you do back home? <br/>Well, this part of the game back home, if I was live out  in the field and they said, "We're going to go to Rick Devens right  now." and I said, "I'm right here." "Okay, thanks, Rick. We're good with you. Now on to the rest of program."  I was willing to talk to Devens. I heard him out. It wasn't a closed door. I'm sorry if you feel that way. <br/>No, you heard me, yeah. <br/>I think Devens hit the nail on the head when he said that  people must know something he doesn't. I'm sure other people know things I don't as well. But for me, making it to the final three, I personally don't  want to sit next to Devens. <br/>Jeff: Devens, hard to hear that? <br/>No. I mean, eventually, they're going to realize, oh, my final three  didn't pan out. I wish I had an extra vote right now. And that's ag what's going to happen to at least three of these  people. <br/>Jeff: Gavin, what Devens said is absolutely true. Some of are you wRong. <br/>I mean, I agree with him 100%, but you have to feel  confident in yourself. I'm sure the other six of us think we have the right plan. It's a matter of who is trusting their gut, and who has really  built the relationships to get them to the next stage of the game. <br/>Jeff: Okay, it is time to vote. Julie, you're up. Julie, you're up. <br/>If you don't go home tonight, at least there's been a line  drawn in the sand. Drawn in the sand. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Jeff: If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want  to play it, now would be the time to do so. <br/>Jeff. I think someone went through my bag. Here we go. I'd like to try to order something off this menu. I want to see if I can order individual immunity or not. <br/>Jeff: This is an advantage menu. It has a choice of three advantages, of which you can play one. Unfortunately, this advantage expired on day nine and has no  power. <br/>Ron and Julie, you are villains! I was already going home. You just want to make me look stupid. So my kids think I'm an idiot? Except, you've proven time and time again that you're untrust  worthy and disloyal, and Julie has proven time and time again that she loves  lying to people's faces. <br/>Yes! <br/>I would like to play this hidden immunity idol for myself. You guys are gems. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. And holds full power. Any votes cast for Devens will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote, Devens. Does not count. Devens. Does not count. Devens, does not count. Devens, does not count. Aurora. That's one vote Aurora. Ron. That's one vote Aurora, one vote Ron. Ron. That's two votes Ron, one vote Aurora. One vote left. <br/>Peace, bro. <br/>Jeff: 13th person voted out and the tenth member of our  jury. Ron, you need to bring me your torch. <br/>That was messed up, dude. <br/>Jeff: Ron, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Devens, you're a great player. <br/>I love you, bro. <br/>It was a lot of fun. <br/>Bye, Ron. <br/>Bye, Ron. <br/>See you, Ron. <br/>That felt good. <br/>Here we go.

Devens is target number one. <br/>Jeff: ...You'll need to find hope. <br/>Special delivery! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: Or a joker could run wild. <br/>I feel like a kid or the fugitive. <br/>I got duped. I should have known I'm not 100% certain what happened. I feel bad about Devens. If I had known how much it hurts to be voted out, I may have  handled myself a little bit differently. I took my eye off the prize. <br/>I heard a lot of lovely things about you. I really have. <br/>I have lied captioned by media access group at wgbh  access.Wgbh.Org
