<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor:A storm devastated the  Saboga Tribe. <br/>The stupid shelter; that I built was destroyed. Digging into the sand is the dumbest idea I've ever had in my  life. <br/>Probst: But at Chapera, the tribe weathered the storm in  comfort...  I slept almost all night long. <br/>Probst: ...giving Rob and Amber's alliance a chance to  heat up. <br/>You're so warm. <br/>Boston Rob and Amber are going to do it. <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge, Chapera continued their  winning streak. Chapera... rice tonight. In addition, take a shower, get cleaned up. Back at camp, the tribe got clean and found the final key to  their lockbox. <br/>Oh. <br/>You guys, that's alcohol. That's whiskey. <br/>Hey, guys, we got rice! <br/>Probst: The rice helped Chapera to an early lead during a  very physical immunity challenge. Chapera, first to start building the puzzle. But the puzzle proved difficult, and Saboga and Mogo Mogo both  took immunity, leaving Chapera with their first immunity loss. Before Tribal Council, the two Robs made a pact. <br/>We can make good allies. <br/>I agree. <br/>I made an alliance with Boston Rob, and a deal's a deal. <br/>Probst: But at Tribal Council, Rob C. learned he'd been played. Rob, the tribe has spoken. Fourteen are left. Who will be voted out tonight? [birds chirping] Who will be voted out tonight? [birds chirping]  Uno, dos, tres, cuatro. <br/>Well, last time I seen her standing on a hill Shaking her  boobs and... [ all yelling and singing ]  We got to build a boat! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I did this in Marquesas. <br/>"Put on your game face for this reward you will  compete. This may change your situation and the quantities you eat. Here are the supplies to build a raft, one that four of you can  race. Tribe pride is on the line. You'd better keep up the pace."  Four of us can race. Chances are, Tom, you might sit out, 'cause you're the biggest  guy. You're going to drag the boat down, so...  I'm an anchor. <br/>Well, this morning we got some tree mail which involves  building a raft. We got a bunch of bamboo, some rope and one paddle. The biggest part of the challenge is obviously building it. <br/>We'll probably be... here... building it. <br/>We'll probably be... here... to have the two power  strokes. You'll be there. You'll be there. You put two bundles and then the platform right on it. Then we're making outriggers. It's like a big catamaran. <br/>Apparently, we're building a pontoon boat, a catamaran  possibly-- I'm not sure-- with two bundles of bamboo underneath supporting  the platform. It sounds great in theory. I hope it works. I'm a little bit worried about building stuff now, ever since  our... first shelter fiasco. <br/>I love it. <br/>Let's start lashing the top to it. I feel very good about the raft. I'm trying to not think about the house. You know, I got my reputation riding on this damn thing again. <br/>Okay, guys, we have to win this today. We're going to have to paddle our asses off. <br/>We came up with a good design, and with four paddles, we  should be able to fly. We want to win. <br/>The key is you got to use every blooming piece of bamboo. <br/>Do you use full length, or do you make it shorter? <br/>Full length. <br/>Yeah? <br/>Why? <br/>'Cause, you know what? It's too much energy to cut it down. <br/>It could be very, very, very simple. These bundles, as they are, will never sink. Don't think too hard. Simple is always better. The challenge was to construct a raft... that was worthy... of  the sea and could carry four of us. So that meant this raft not only had to carry Lex and Kathy and  I and a normal human being, but it's got to carry 260 pounds of Hatch. <br/>I think it's good for steering. <br/>Let's kind of go back and forth and see how stable it is. But ultimately, it came down to laziness and pure exhaustion  that designed that raft, and nothing more. <br/>The raft will definitely float, but it won't be swift. It will not be swift. <br/>I'm going to tell you something. That raft... That one's going to win us this challenge. <br/>I say nice rack... Oh, raft. <br/>Yeah, wait. Have you been drinking? <br/>No. No, I just... I-I meant "raft" when I said  "rack."  Hey, Tom, I got your waterbed for you. <br/>All right. <br/>That's the best built thing since Alicia. <br/>If I could vote anybody out right now, it'd be Tom. He's a stupid drunk. A stupid klutzy drunk. I don't care for the man whatsoever. I don't think his sexual innuendoes are funny. <br/>I christen the ship. <br/>Tom came down with the whiskey to christen the vessel. <br/>I christen...  Oh, yeah! <br/>And I'm like, "Oh, you guys, don't move, I got to  pee." So I peed right on the raft. So that we decided that I christened it right there. <br/>You pissed on it? It's supposed to be pure grain liquor. Kiss my ass. What a hag. My God, that's going to make a hole in the driftwood. That'll rot any wood I know. I'm afraid the ship's going to sink now. Where did Sue piss? <br/>Right here. <br/>Go, Tom, you do the honors. <br/>Okay. <br/>I christen thee...  I christen thee vessel the Suzie Q., in honor of me old  lady Sue. [ all cheer ] And in the honor, I shall take one little goober. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. What's going on, Saboga? <br/>Life's good. <br/>Probst: What's up, Mogo Mogo? Come on in, Chapera. Getting your first look at the new Chapera tribe. <br/>Damn, Sue's still here. <br/>Cesternino. <br/>Probst: Rob voted out at the last Tribal Council. Nobody's safe in this game. All right, you ready for today's challenge? <br/>Yes, sir. This morning, you were given materials, told to build a raft. Here's how the challenge works: two tribe members will start on  the raft. Their job, paddle out and rescue two other tribe members who  have been stranded in the water on separate floating platforms. Once you've picked up both tribe members, continue out to a  buoy. You'll grab a flag, paddle back to shore up the beach, across  the finish line. First two tribes to get back with their boat and run across the  finish line with their flag win reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: For the winning tribe... What might be in here,  Hatch? <br/>Fish hooks. <br/>Probst: Fishing hooks. To go along with the fishing hooks, a fishing spear. <br/>Oh, yeah! <br/>Probst: Should make fishing a whole lot easier. In addition, for the first two tribes, a clue to your lock box. Chapera, it has no value to you. You've already had your rice and most of your whiskey... but for  Saboga and Mogo Mogo, it could mean rice tonight. For the third part of the reward, the tribe that finishes last  will be dissolved. <br/>What? <br/>Probst: The tribe members will be absorbed by the two  remaining tribes. We're going to have a school yard game of "Pick 'Em."  We will alternate picks. The winning tribe gets to pick first. For the losing tribe, you will not return back to your beach. Your personal items and any other clothing items will be sent to  your new home. Everything else: rewards, your shelter, tools, anything else  you've acquired, you'll never see again. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: Chapera, you have one extra member. Who sat out during the building of the raft? <br/>Big Tom. <br/>Probst: So you won't participate in this. Mogo Mogo, who sat out? <br/>Shii Ann. <br/>Probst: Shii Ann. So you won't participate either. I'll give you a couple of minutes to strategize. Wait for my go. Here we go, guys: a reward challenge with huge stakes. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, Mogo Mogo! <br/>Probst: Everybody even off the start. All rafts are floating. That's a good sign. <br/>We got it. <br/>Probst: Mogo Mogo out to a slight lead. Saboga's raft looks nice, but it's slow. Mogo Mogo pulling away with the worst-looking raft of the three. Mogo Mogo approaches Kathy. Don't jump in, Kathy. Get on. Mogo Mogo still with the big lead. Saboga approaches their first member, looking to pick up Jenna. Chapera close to picking up Alicia. Alicia pulls 'em in tight and steps onboard. Chapera has their first tribe member. Saboga has their first tribe member. Mogo Mogo increases their lead. Lex, Colby and Kathy nearing Richard. Richard pulls 'em close. Hatch is onboard. [ indistinct talking ]  Probst: Saboga by far with the best looking raft and the  least effective. Chapera nears Amber. Amber's onboard. Chapera has all their tribe members, heading for the flag. Mogo Mogo at their flag. Kathy reaches for the flag... and she has it. Mogo Mogo heading back. Saboga has all four tribe members. They're heading for their flag. Chapera making up some ground. [ indistinct shouting ] Chapera reaches for their tribe flag. They have it-- Chapera has their flag. They're heading back. Mogo Mogo with a big lead. <br/>Come on, Mogo Mogo. <br/>Probst: Saboga needs to make up a lot of ground. Losing tribe will be dissolved, absorbed by the other two  tribes. You do not want to be last in this challenge. Rupert has the flag for Saboga. It is a race back to shore between Saboga and Chapera for second  place. [ shouts of encouragement ]  Probst: Hit the flag with your raft and you're there. <br/>Hit it! Hit it! <br/>Probst: Mogo Mogo's clear. It's a race in to the finish. Mogo Mogo celebrating before they even finish. <br/>Come on, run to the finish line! [ shouts of joy ]  Probst: Mogo Mogo wins reward and keeps their tribe  together. Let's go, Saboga! Let's go, Chapera! <br/>We get to pick first. Okay. Bring him along, Rich. <br/>Yeah, bring him along. <br/>Bring him? <br/>It's coming. It's coming. <br/>Probst: Chapera, raft's got to hit the flag. You're clear. It's a race across the finish line. Chapera finishes second, keeps their tribe intact. [ applause ] Saboga finishes last, and Saboga will soon be no  longer. <br/>Probst: Okay, first things first. Mogo Mogo. Your fishing spear. <br/>Yes! Richard! <br/>Probst: Hooks. [ whoops ]  Probst: Last clue to the lock box. Find the key, you'll have rice. Here's how it's going to work: it is a schoolyard pick 'em. Mogo Mogo, since you won, you'll pick first. As you are selected, come to me, we'll trade buffs. Mogo Mogo, who's your first pick? <br/>Ethan. <br/>Probst: Ethan, come on over. Saboga no more. Mogo Mogo. Chapera, first pick? <br/>Rupert. <br/>Probst: Rupert, no longer a member of Saboga. You are now a member of Chapera. <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>Probst: Mogo Mogo, make your next pick. <br/>Jerri. <br/>Come on, Jerri. <br/>Probst: Jerri and Colby reunited. Jerri now a member of Mogo Mogo. Jenna, you get the honor, if it is, putting Saboga to rest. You're now a member of Chapera. [ cheering ] All right, guys, you all have a lot of time to get  to know each other-- head back to camp. <br/>All right, guys, on three. Ready? One, two, three...  Mogo Mogo! <br/>Welcome home, you guys. <br/>I'm... so happy. <br/>Winning the Reward Challenge, the biggest reward was  gaining control of dismantling Saboga. We chose Ethan because we knew if we had him on our tribe, we  had control of how long he stays in this game. And then after that, we just wanted someone that we didn't think  he had bonded with that much, and Jerri was the answer. We still have the original Mogo Mogo Tribe, and Jerri and Ethan  are on the outside looking in. <br/>Oh, my God! This is beautiful. <br/>And see our little balcony? <br/>I love it. <br/>Wow, that's fantastic. <br/>It's pretty waterproof. <br/>You guys, this is amazing. <br/>I feel like my entire time out here, every day I've  started over. And now I'm on a new tribe, start over again. It's just, like, one big... first day for me. <br/>Can I just say thank you. I'm very, very happy to be over here. <br/>Good! We're happy you're here. <br/>I'm gonna cry. <br/>We're glad to have you. <br/>I swore I wouldn't cry anymore. My spirits are very high right now. I don't miss Saboga at all. Not even a little. <br/>You'll be happy. You'll be happy here. <br/>I will be very happy here. <br/>I can't believe it worked out like that, I can't believe  it. Wait till you see our camp. <br/>Over at Saboga, I had complete control, and I was telling  everyone who to vote off. And then they dissolved us, which I don't like, because the  first 13 days that I had put into this game washed down the toilet. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Cool, right? [ Rupert laughing ]  Sit down. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>We have the swing set and the chess board. <br/>Does it hold you, Tom? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>I can sit? Oh, my God. <br/>Their camp is... [ exhales ] ...compared to our camp, our  camp was hobo junction. Theirs is the Taj Mahal. [ indistinct chatter ]  We're home! We're home! Yay! <br/>We're going to kick the green team's ass. [ applause ]  It's in a shallow grave. [ applause ]  It's in a shallow grave. <br/>First thing this morning, got up, went and looked for the  key. [ key rattling ] [ cheering ]  It felt so good to find it. I was so excited. Everybody's, like, "Yay, Jerri!" I'm feeling,  "Yay, now I'm a part of Mogo Mogo."  Oh, nice. [ gasps ]  Oh, my God. Wow. <br/>Wow. Oh, nice. <br/>The rice is soggy. <br/>Oh, my God, it's totally wet. Unfortunately, when we opened the carton, the rice... half the  rice was rotten. <br/>We lost a lot of rice. The note on the box did say, "Keep this dry. Very valuable." And we tried our best. I've run out of rice once before, and the consequences aren't  good. I don't want to do it again. Even though we have rice, we do still need fish. I'm going to go when it gets low, so that's probably hour and a  half. I'm not going to go till then. If you have any interest in high tide...  I'm gonna try it for a little bit, too. <br/>Go get 'em, man. <br/>Good luck, Ethan. <br/>I think Ethan's always, uh, playing the game-- he's,  "Sure, I'll go try, sure I'll go try," not wanting to go step on my  toes. "No. Are you going to go? No? If you're not, I'll go try when you aren't." Ooh, he's  good. <br/>Ethan, how'd you do? <br/>Not much, but... every little bit helps. I went out there and I went spear fishing. Inside I'm jumping, I'm like, "I caught my first  fish!" And I see Richard's face, he's, like, competition. Like, I felt scared. I didn't want to, you know, step on his toes. <br/>You got a trigger. Killer. <br/>Hot dog. <br/>He got a fish. I'm the only one that's supposed to get fish. I'm gonna have to fix that up and bring back 12 now. <br/>Oh, my God, look at the fish that you've got. <br/>Two of them. <br/>It's huge. [ cheering ]  All right, Richard! <br/>Guys want to feud on how many fish they bring in, [ laughs  ]: rock on. We'll just have lots of fish, 'cause the boys are just playing  one-up on each other. <br/>We have a ton of fish here. Oh, Richard, that looks awesome. <br/>"Two new tribes, now we'll Oh, Richard, that looks  awesome. <br/>"Two new tribes, now we'll see whose speed and  strength earn immunity. It's really quite simple. Capture the flag, that's it. Winners end up with the idol. Losers end up in the pit."  I think we'll win, and if we don't, who cares? There's a lot of people we got to get rid of. Nobody heard me say that. <br/>That sounds great. <br/>That's fun, I mean...  Yeah, this is gonna be fun. <br/>Thus far, our mantra has been, "slow and steady wins  the race." It's served us well. We came in second place. Second place now sends you home. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! First things first. Lex, I will take one half of the immunity idol, put it with the  other half that I retrieved from Saboga, which is no more. We now have one idol. One winner, one loser. All right, for today's Immunity Challenge, both tribes must  navigate their way along a series of narrow balance beams to retrieve  tribe-colored flags from the opposite end of the course. In the middle is a battle bridge. When two opposing tribe members meet on opposite ends of the  bridge, it is a physical showdown. Your goal, get the other tribe member off that bridge and into  the water. The first person to hit the water returns to the start, forfeits  their flag. Winner moves on. A tribe can only have two members on the course at any time. You got to retain a revolving order. The first tribe to get 20 flags from one side to the other wins  immunity, guaranteed a one-in-13 shot at a million dollars. Take a spot on your platform, wait for my go. Here we go. For immunity... survivors ready? Go! <br/>Let's go, Hatch. <br/>Probst: Big Tom and Hatch on the course. Shii Ann, Amber on the course. Hatch having a little trouble, causing a roadblock. <br/>Good job. <br/>Go, Tom. Take your time, Tom. <br/>Probst: Amber, Amber, Amber, Amber, look at that. Nice! <br/>Close, Amber. <br/>Come on there, Amber. <br/>Nice, Shii Ann, very nice. <br/>Nice job, guys. <br/>Nice job, Hatch. <br/>Probst: Hatch has a flag. He's got to get back. <br/>Come on, Tommy. <br/>Go get him, Tom. [ yells ]  Probst: Hatch is down. Drop the flag, and go to the start. <br/>Take your time, take your time, Tom, relax. Take your time, Tom. <br/>Come on, Tom, get across, get across now. <br/>Go all the way across, Tom. Come on! Tom, bring the flag. <br/>Bring the flag. <br/>Probst: Big Tom wanted a showdown, Ethan not interested. <br/>All the way across, Tom. Come on, Tom...  Oh, Shii Ann takes a dip in the water. Drop the flag, head back to the start. <br/>You can do it. <br/>Good job. <br/>Probst: Big Tom with a flag. <br/>Come on, Amber, good job. <br/>Probst: Amber with a flag. Chapera up 2-0. Boston Rob waiting for a showdown. He has planted it at the battle bridge. We have our first showdown. Here's how it's going to work. You'll both come out into the middle of the bridge. I'm going to say, "Three, two, one, go." On  "go," you go. Three, two, one, go. [ shouting ]  Go, Ethan! Let's go, Ethan! Come on, baby! <br/>Probst: The first one to hit the water's out. Boston Rob hit the water first. Ethan took a big header on the side of the pool. <br/>Ethan, are you okay? <br/>Probst: You all right? <br/>Good job, Easy. <br/>Probst: Ethan, you hop up here on the platform. Boston Rob's back at the start. Rupert, back to the start. Balance, a very big part of this challenge. <br/>All right, Ethan. <br/>Ethan with the first flag for Mogo Mogo. It's Chapera two, Mogo Mogo one. [ indistinct voices ]  Probst: Jerri with another flag for Mogo Mogo. <br/>Yeah, yeah...  Probst: Hatch and Jenna in a battle. <br/>Oh, baby girl. <br/>Have you ever heard the story of David and Goliath? <br/>Probst: Here we go. Three, two, one, go. <br/>Beat him, Jenna. Come on, Jenna. Go for his feet. Don't let him get you. [ shouting ]  Probst: Jenna hits the water first. Jenna's out. <br/>No way! He hit the water...  No! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Come on, Hatch. <br/>Oh, come on. <br/>Nice job, girls. <br/>Nice job, Hatch. <br/>Probst: Kathy with another flag for Mogo Mogo. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Probst: Alicia with another flag for Chapera. We're tied up 3-3. <br/>Go easy, Tom. Go easy. <br/>Probst: Big Tom... Oh, oh! <br/>He's still up! Get up there, Tommy! Yeah! <br/>Probst: Still on the course. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: Wow! That's going to hurt tomorrow. <br/>There she is, Tommy! <br/>Probst: Hold up, guys. We have a battle. Big Tom and Ethan. Come on, Ethan. Three, two, one, go. [ shouting ]  Tom won! <br/>Probst: Ethan, first in the water. Big Tom moving on. <br/>Come on, Sue. Nicely done. <br/>You got it, Kathy. <br/>Sue, get up there. <br/>I want this one. I got to take my time. Move, baby! [ speaks indistinctly ]  Excuse me. <br/>Want some? <br/>Good job. Yeah, right. <br/>Want some, honey? [ shouting ]  Probst: Guys, come on. Nobody cares about that stuff. <br/>Yeah, we don't, Richard. <br/>Come on, Alicia. You're doing great now. Just cruise it. Cruise it, Alicia, cruise it. <br/>Colby, get to the beam, quick. <br/>Probst: We have a showdown. West Coast versus East Coast. Colby versus Boston Rob. Three, two, one, go. <br/>Come on, Rob. Go, Rob! Win it! [ shouting ]  Probst: Colby hits the water first, Boston Rob moves on. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: We're going. <br/>Nice, Rupert. <br/>Good job! <br/>Nice, Rupert! [ grunting ]  Probst: Rupert still unable to make it across. Head back to the start. Boston Rob is out of control. He has a flag, and he's heading back. <br/>Come on, Rob. <br/>Take your time, Rob. Take your time. <br/>Careful, Rob, we need those flags. Boston Rob, no trouble. <br/>Be careful. <br/>I'm jumping off, so Rob can go on. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Shii Ann in with another flag for Mogo Mogo. Rob in with the 18th flag. Strategy coming into play. Most of the Chapera tribe falling off, so Rob can run the  course. Boston Rob going for Chapera's final leg. <br/>Come on, you got it, bring it home! Mogo Mogo going to have to engage in battle, or Chapera's going  to walk away with this. <br/>Come on, Rob. Boston Rob versus Kathy. <br/>Go low, go low! Three, two, one, go. Kathy, good strategy. <br/>Rob, you got to do the same thing. <br/>Do the same thing, Rob, get down. <br/>Come on, Rob. Nice! <br/>There we go! <br/>Probst: Kathy hits the water. Let him go. <br/>Jump again. Jump. <br/>Amber heading in. <br/>No! No! No! No! No! No! <br/>Probst: That's 19 for Chapera. Boston Rob has the winning flag. Go! Chapera wins immunity. [ cheering ]  You did it! <br/>Good strategy. [ shouting ]  Probst: Chapera, immunity. Safe from Tribal Council. [ cheering ] Mogo Mogo, Tribal Council tonight. Won't be the first time you've lost a member. It will be the first time you're voting out a member. You have this afternoon to think about who that's going to be. I'll see you there. Head on back. <br/>Those guys were freaking out. Did you hear Richard? He whined. <br/>Yeah, they were like, "They're jumping, they're  jumping. Everybody's jumping!"  "Look, they're all just jumping off."  You call it what you want to, we call it winning. <br/>Yeah, hell, yeah. Some of us got no balance. <br/>I hope they vote Richard off, 'cause what he did to me was  absolutely...  That was disgusting. [ all talking ]  I wanted to get past, so I wouldn't have to battle Richard  naked. It felt real good to be able to propel my team to the win. And I may not be as strong as some of them, but I guarantee I'm  tougher than every single one of them. <br/>Welcome to reality. And you got Colby in. [ shouting ]  You got him. <br/>Colby? Yeah, he's not as tough as you think, ladies. <br/>Chapera! [ cheering ]  We lost the challenge, and, uh, it was... it was a blow. I really like our tribe, and now we have to go to Tribal. So... the game is on. For the first time at Mogo Mogo, the game is really on. <br/>Oh, it's a downer. But I also don't like sitting around the camp talking about  would have, could have, should have. You know, it's time to move on. <br/>Yeah. <br/>This is a game where the more you strategize and the more  you think about it, the more you change your mind. Because a lot of times, your gut will tell you something totally  different than what you've already agreed to do. So, basically here's where we are-- Richard's the one we got to  get rid of. He's the snake in the grass...  I agree. <br/>...that's gonna cause us the most trouble. He's just... he's a cancer in this tribe, and he's going. If you give Richard time enough, he will fester and then he will  spread, you know? <br/>But do you think he's strong enough to keep around for  more challenges? <br/>No. No. We can do without him. Um... the cool thing is, he thinks we're dropping you tonight, so,  we're just going to let him think that, okay? <br/>The plan tonight is to vote off Richard Hatch. For all I know, they're going to vote me off. You know, I'm super paranoid, but, um... I think I got a 50-50  shot. <br/>Okay? <br/>All right. <br/>I was approached by... Lex, Colby and Ethan to vote for  Rich. I immediately said, "Hell, yeah, count me in." But the  downside is, it doesn't make any sense for me to team up with three guys who  are then going to kick my ass in every challenge afterwards. <br/>He just took off to go... in every challenge afterwards. <br/>He just took off to go...  Get clams. <br/>Clamming, yeah. <br/>What's his thought? <br/>Well, I said, "I can't tell you "you're going  home tonight, but I can't tell you you're not, either." You know, you  showed in those challenges how dominant you are as a swimmer and runner and  everything else. There's no question nobody wants to compete with you. <br/>Right. <br/>So I guess I got to go with you, I got to believe you. I got to believe you're with me, 'cause Ethan would be more of a  physical threat to you. <br/>When Ethan and Jerri joined our tribe, we all agreed that  Ethan would be the first to go. Now all of a sudden, Lex is coming up to me and Kathy and  telling us it's Richard. Richard. Richard Hatch. It's a mistake. I think... it's a mistake. If we take Richard out now, who do we have? Just you and me. <br/>Well, we got to think about it some more. I need to think before I react. We got to think more. <br/>What do you think about all this craziness that's going  on? <br/>I know. <br/>I mean, if we vote Colby, I'm in. <br/>I know you are. <br/>I'm trying to convince Kathy that instead of Rich, it's  Colby. My own personal reasons. Some revenge involved, for sure. I got screwed over by Colby once already. <br/>I totally see it. <br/>I mean, worse than you could ever imagine, and I would  hate to put myself in a position to repeat the same mistake. <br/>The only thing that bothered me today with this decision,  it wasn't unilateral. You know, Colby didn't come to all of us. He just went up there and made that decision. <br/>Yeah, and that's exactly what I mean. <br/>I don't know, it's a hard call. It's a big move. <br/>Okay, if you start thinking differently, just let me know. <br/>I will. <br/>I'm on your side. <br/>Okay, same here. [ laughs ]  I don't want to fall prey to the same person who screwed  me over in Australia. <br/>Time for a Tribal Council, and everything starts going  haywire-- it's great. <br/>See, everything's flushing out right now. <br/>Now Jerri says she's been approached to get rid of me. The only way that could possibly have happened is Ethan, Lex and  Colby. <br/>I think, if we go in, we vote for Colby, I'm in. I'm in 100%. <br/>Okay, that's it, then. 'Cause if you're not for anything else, then we'll just do that. All right, Colby goes. So they blew it. How dare you approach somebody to get rid of me? You must go bye-bye now. So Colby has to go home. [ thunder crashing ]  Well, Ethan and Lex and Colby feel like they're the  strongest and will hold the challenges together. So what do you say-- Colby? You don't know yet? You're going to let me know when you decide. <br/>I know. Give me ten minutes. <br/>All right. [ chuckles ] [ mimics giggling ]  Colby and Richard are on the chopping block tonight, and I  have got myself in the middle. I don't know how I got there. So do you trust your gut? Do you trust loyalty? Or do you just go with sort of what makes sense? And where am I going? I don't know. <br/>Probst: Welcome to Tribal Council. This is the first time the original Mogo Mogo has had to deal  with the task of voting somebody out. Before we get to that, let's talk a little bit. Going back to the Reward Challenge, Richard, that raft didn't  look like it was going to make it three feet in the water. <br/>Come on, you knew we were going to win as soon as you saw  that bundle of joy. <br/>Probst: That was Bad News Bears for sure. As a result, you get two new tribe members. Ethan, you were the first person picked in the school yard  "Pick 'Em. " Was your initial instinct, "Hey, they like me,"  or "Wow, I'm in trouble"? <br/>A little bit of both. But as you know, you remember that first Tribal Council, my back  was against the wall, so I was just happy to have a change of pace and, you  know, just get a new lease on life, really. <br/>Probst: Colby, how are you doing second time around? <br/>I mean, it is a much different experience because everyone  knows how to play this game, and so you cannot coast, uh, although a lot of  people are doing it. <br/>Probst: Kathy, how much more difficult is it playing with  18 people who are really good at this game? <br/>Oh, it's 100% the other direction than when we were  playing before. There was loyalty the last time, you know, where you'd get  friendships and bondings. And, uh, right now it's just pure unadulterated playing the  game. <br/>Probst: Hatch, how busy was the afternoon back at camp,  because it's game on now. For the first time, you have to vote somebody out. <br/>Yeah, it's true. This is our first time somebody's got to go. Of course, you know, I have no target on my back. [ blows air thorough lips ] [ Richard chuckles ]  Probst: Colby, what went on at camp this afternoon when  you got back? It had to be a busy afternoon, positioning. <br/>It was. Yeah, it was. It was. It's a hard day when you got to go back, and you have a few  hours to scramble. Ultimately, someone's getting duped. Someone is having the wool pulled over their eyes, and... [  chuckles ] you won't know until that vote goes up whether it's you. <br/>Probst: What are you basing your vote on tonight? <br/>Um, cutting out the cancer. <br/>Probst: How about for you, Kathy? <br/>Taking the big players out--taking the power players out. <br/>Probst: Surprised who you're voting for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: And with that, it's time to vote. Ethan, you're up. <br/>It does come down to this. You really could have trusted me. I was... I was on your side. I know that's hard to believe, but it's true. <br/>Hatch, you're a hell of a player and you almost had me  convinced I can trust you. But my gut told me not to. I'm not going to. Best of luck. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Probst: Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Colby. Hatch. Rich. Two votes: Rich. One vote: Colby. Hatch. That's three votes: Rich. One vote: Colby. The fifth person voted out of Survivor: All-Stars... Rich. <br/>I've been bamboozled! <br/>Probst: That's four. That's enough. <br/>Good on you all. Man, oh, man. <br/>We played it, didn't we? <br/>[ chuckles ]: Yeah, you did. <br/>Probst: Rich, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Food. Food. <br/>Probst: Well, if tonight's vote showed you one thing, it  ought to be this: when you are competing against players of this caliber in  this game, it doesn't matter how good you are, you are always at risk. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night.

Someone like you doesn't have to lie this entire game because  you don't make a decision. I don't have any respect for that. <br/>Captain America with his good teeth, blah, blah, blah. <br/>Probst: And Sue speaks out. It wasn't "sort of," Jeff! I was humiliated and totally spent, Jeff! <br/>Oops! [ laughs ] So much for what I thought. I'm gone. How much fun is Survivor? Yeah, I was blown out of the water today and didn't even know  it. I've never had my torch snuffed. I've never had it put out, and here I am, I'm gone. I'm gone. Oh, fifth out of the game. I wanted the check again. Damn.
