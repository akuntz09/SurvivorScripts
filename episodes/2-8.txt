<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor: Kucha and Ogakor merged into  one tribe at equal numbers with five members each, calling themselves  Barramundi. The tribe set up camp on a new beach and started from scratch. [ cheering] In a test of endurance, the first individual  immunity challenge lasted over ten hours. Tina stepped down to give the more vulnerable Keith immunity, so  that the ex-Ogakor tribe could take the advantage at Tribal Council. So, we're ruling this a deadlock vote. Colby and Jeff were deadlocked into tie, so Jeff's votes at  previously Tribal Councils tipped the scales, and Jeff was voted out of the  tribe. Nine survivors remain. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Rodger: It's a late-sleeping bunch, isn't it? <br/>Alicia: Yeah. <br/>Rodger: A lot different than... than us. <br/>Alicia: I know. <br/>Rodger: Mike would've been up three hours ago. <br/>Alicia: I know. <br/>Rodger: Every time I do that, I think about old Mike. <br/>Alicia: No kidding. <br/>Rodger: And, you know, every time from now on, when  we're... when we're around the fire, we will think of it. <br/>Alicia: Yep. <br/>Rodger: After the last Tribal Council, I just felt like we  had been outwitted by Ogakor. Kucha's tribe could be picked off very easily. They're in a good position to do that. We could be an extinct tribe, no longer on the face of the  earth. To me, it's, uh, one-on-one and every man for himself from here  on out. See, I can catch 'em. I am in it to win just like anybody else. I'm going to give it my best shot. My game plan right now to try to assure my survival is try to  keep catching fish. Ooh, yes. If they're going to vote somebody off, it's going to probably  not be the person that is supplying 'em with the food. I think that is my greatest asset at this time. I love this fishing hole. Whoo! <br/>Nick: Wow, look at that crocodile. Do not want to go in that water again. <br/>Alicia: This game has definitely changed. There's no doubt about it. It's a whole new game. New people. New set of rules. <br/>Nick: You keep on catching fish, you'll definitely be the  last of Kutcha to go. [ laughing]  Alicia: Ogakor knows they're in a good position now to be  the last five, but they also have to know that four members on this jury now  are going to be Kucha members, and these people decide who's going to be the  winner. They better start stepping up and being real nice to us. <br/>Keith: I feel like I'm on a and being real nice to us. <br/>Keith: I feel like I'm on a fishing trip with you. It's like I'm with... you're my older brother and taking me  fishing. <br/>Rodger: Everybody is-is real nice to everybody else, but  then you can still see groups getting off and talking, and you know what  they're talking about. You know the million dollars for being the final survivor is on  everybody's mind. <br/>Amber: We're exactly where we want to be. <br/>Colby: As a team, Ogakor, we outplayed 'em. <br/>Amber: It's just, like, I feel, like, some pressure has  been lifted off my shoulders. <br/>Colby: I agree. I... I'm sleeping so much better now after getting past the  merge and the final... the final vote to see who-who grabs the majority. <br/>Amber: I know. <br/>Colby: And we won. <br/>Amber: Geez! <br/>Keith: Yeah, I think Ogakor was definitely a team that  stayed out of vision knowing that we needed to whittle down the Kucha people. Kucha knows what we're doing. They are really good, nice people, which does make it harder as  the days go on. And the closer you become to an individual, you start  questioning, "Geez, you know, I like this person better than somebody I  know on my own team."  Rodger: Well, if I had to guess, I'd say somebody in your  all's group is going to be a millionaire. <br/>Keith: Well, you know, help yourself out, my friend. It just seems natural that certain individuals gravitate to each  other, and Tina and I have made the decision that we want to be with people  we like right at the very end. <br/>Elisabeth: You know Rodger has my heart. I love him. <br/>Tina: He's a good one. <br/>Elisabeth: I love him. See, I knew you guys would hit it off, too. <br/>Tina: I like him. You go into a merger thinking that you're very much aligned with  a team, but then, as time goes by, you might find out that there's people  that are more deserving, you know? I want this to be on an individual basis, and I want the good  guys to win. <br/>Jerri: Today has been just so... weird. I feel, like, a lot of distance between myself and everybody  else right now. We do have the advantage now. We're five... Kucha's... to Kucha's four, but that's not  relaxing me at all. It's the paranoia again setting in. We're in a situation where Tina and Keith could team up with the  Kucha people. You cannot be complacent. Your back will be stabbed faster than you can spit. [ clattering] Ooh! <br/>Tina: Ever since the Ooh! <br/>Tina: Ever since the beginning, the cooking of the rice  has been a problem. It was a problem at Ogakor, and the same problem came with us to  Barramundi. Basically, what it is is the rice has to be cooked to Jerri's  specifications. It has to be stirred a certain number of times. The lid has to stay on. It has to be... perfect, you know, or... you-you catch it. <br/>What kind of spices we have tonight, ladies? <br/>Elisabeth: A little parmesan pizza mix. <br/>Alicia: The lemon pepper is not great on the rice. <br/>Amber: It's not? <br/>Alicia: No. Not great. <br/>Elisabeth: Alicia and I were on the side of the fire, and  Jerri and Amber were sitting on a log just watching every move we made. Every time I would... I would take a lid off, I could see them,  you know, tensing up, like, you know, "Why is she taking the lid off? Why is she stirring now?"  Amber: Be careful. <br/>Tina: They're not going to go. They're not going to go. <br/>Amber: If you guys have a knife, a knife might be easier  to stir. <br/>Elisabeth: Well, don't even worry about it. <br/>Tina: She actually got it. <br/>Amber: You got it? <br/>Elisabeth: Alicia and I were getting more tense trying to  make it. You know, we were testing the rice. We always test to it make sure it's done, and Jerri's over on  her log. "It's mushy," she says. <br/>Jerri: Mashed potatoes. <br/>Elisabeth: I know you don't like mushy... but it's mushy. <br/>Alicia: I'll stir it until it's done. <br/>Jerri: I guess it doesn't really matter. It's such crappy rice, anyway. <br/>Elisabeth: I felt as if I were under a magnifying glass,  and I do not need to be meant to feel that way at all. Like, don't tell me what I'm supposed to be doing when I'm  making you dinner. Don't. <br/>Tina: Whenever you have a whole bunch, it's really hard to  make it, I think. Poor little old Elisabeth was sitting there trying to cook the rice,  and Jerri made some comments about it. It hurt Elisabeth's feelings, because here she is, trying to  help the tribe, and then to not be appreciated for it and to be judged--  that's very hurtful. And I think that right there probably was enough for Elisabeth  to say, "You know what? You'll get my vote." I try to stay away from cooking, so I  don't have to be judged. <br/>Jerri: Ah! <br/>Elisabeth: Within Ogakor, I already am spotting some  cracks. There is definite dissent between Tina and Jerri. Does everybody have something to eat with? <br/>Tina: Yes. <br/>Alicia: Okay, hold on. <br/>Colby: Amber? Thank you. <br/>Rodger would like to say a blessing. <br/>Tina: That's a good idea. <br/>You ready? <br/>Rodger: Yes, everybody ready? <br/>Okay. <br/>Rodger: Father God, we give Thee thanks today for this  beautiful Lord's day and for all Thy many wonderful blessings. We thank Thee, dear Lord, for this opportunity which we have as  a group to come to know one another. <br/>Elisabeth: If things are going to get really crazy,  especially now, you know, and seeing that there is a hole in Ogakor, it kind  of opens the door to really take advantage of that. If they're not all together, their plan's kind of wrecked. <br/>Rodger: All these things we ask in the name of our lord  and savior, Jesus Christ. Amen. <br/>ALL: Amen. <br/>Tina: Thank you, Rodger. <br/>Jerri: That was nice. <br/>Elisabeth: It wasn't until today that I really started  feeling like, "Okay, Elisabeth, do what you can do to take Kucha to a  victory. "If you want to keep playing this game... you better get a  little more ruthless."  Rodger: I'm going to try to catch something with a cork  and I just bet I don't have any luck. <br/>Alicia: With a cork? <br/>Rodger: Yeah. Oh, we're just sitting ducks now. <br/>Alicia: You know what? <br/>Rodger: Sitting ducks sitting by the fire. <br/>Alicia: Whatever. It's not fun anymore. Laying down and talking to everybody at night is not as much fun  as it used to be. <br/>Rodger: No, no, no...  Alicia: You know? Waking up in the morning and seeing everybody's face-- not as  fun as it used to be. It's not fun anymore. <br/>Elisabeth: You're not here to sit back and wait for  someone to vote you off. I just really would love to just light a fire under everyone. Well, that makes me sick. I'm not going to sit here and be a sitting duck. No one else wants to keep playing, I'll do whatever it takes to  stay out here longest and keep, keep Kucha going. I think there's a crack in their tribe right now. Watch. You guys, pay attention to Jerri and Tina. Pay real...  Rodger: You think it's going to be women against the men? <br/>Elisabeth: Pay attention to...  Alicia: No. <br/>Elisabeth: No, because I think Jerri and Tina have issues. <br/>Alicia: And, well, Jerri and Keith...  Elisabeth: Watch out, 'cause she might be fishing around  here. <br/>Alicia: Jerri and Keith definitely do. <br/>Elisabeth: Yeah. <br/>Rodger: I'd like to see...  Alicia: Jerri does not love Keith. <br/>Elisabeth: Yeah. You guys, honestly, well, I mean, I know Jerri would be my next  vote. <br/>Alicia: Right. <br/>Elisabeth: Jerri, I think... I think she's gonna get votes  from their tribe. I honestly do. <br/>Alicia: I'll tell you what. She definitely has the hots for Colby, and he is not at all...  He just could care less. <br/>Elisabeth: I'm hoping Kucha will have some pull, 'cause  people can't stand Jerri anyway in her own tribe, and I told them that maybe  we could approach Keith and Tina and say, "Look, we'd like to get rid of  Jerri. We're going to vote for Jerri, too," grab some of their  people and have them come with us. <br/>Rodger: It's gonna be fun these last few days whatever  happens. <br/>Say something. <br/>Alicia: I'm planning on having fun. <br/>Rodger: Yeah. <br/>Alicia: I really don't care anymore. I'm going to go all out. Elisabeth, although she comes across as a, you know, a very meek  and mild kind of person, she is a serious competitor. Believe me, Elisabeth is a force to be reckoned with. See, look at them. <br/>Tina: Nick's cooking two fish. <br/>Elisabeth: I know. Tina and I have become close. I mean close, outback close. Outback close is close enough to get the dirt you want on  someone else. Close enough to let you advance ahead of the person you're  trying to get close to. But then, last night, she's, like, complaining about how we're  doing the rice. I don't know how you dealt with her that long in your tribe. <br/>Tina: Not an easy thing, sister. She'll get hers. It's coming. <br/>Elisabeth: Ogakor's target is Jerri. I mean, the talk I just had with Tina-- she can't take Jerri. Neither can Keith, and they are trying to get votes for her. I don't know if I'm just a dumb optimist or just in denial, but  I think Jerri is ready to go. I'll say it for her, "Jerri, you're ready to  go."  Rodger: We got mail. <br/>Tina: Oh, my goodness! [ gasps] Colorful mail. <br/>Rodger: Boomerangs? <br/>Tina: Oh, my gosh. Look at that. <br/>Rodger: Oh, we're gonna have a boomerang contest. <br/>Tina: Mail, guys. <br/>Rodger: And boomerangs. So, what do think? <br/>Tina: "The next challenge is easy. Just catch the return, and a good start for the morning, the  winner will earn."  Rodger: You got to throw it and catch it. You got to throw it and catch it. <br/>Oh. <br/>I've never thrown a boomerang. <br/>Rodger: Without getting... Without getting hooked in the  teeth with it. <br/>Amber: Are we going to have to, like, throw it at  something and like...? <br/>Nick: No. You got to make it come around in a circle and then catch it. <br/>Alicia: You got to make it come back and catch it. [ chortling] âª  Jeff: Okay, guys. Today's reward challenge, boomerang toss. Most popular weapon in Australia. It's pretty simple. You stand inside the white circle and throw the boomerang. The person whose boomerang comes closest to the red flag wins  the reward. Make sense? Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>ALL: Yes! <br/>Jeff: All right, Jerri, come here. [ Jerri laughs]  Jeff: I'll let you read this off to the, uh...  Jerri: Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: ...to the troops. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, it's a menu! <br/>Jerri: "Appetizer..."  Amber: Oh. [ Jerri laughs]  Jerri: "Smoked salmon and shrimp. Entree: grilled chicken, pasta medley, Greek salad, rolls with  butter."  Amber: Oh! Rolls...  Jerri: "Delicious desserts, du jour." It's a  full meal! <br/>Oh! <br/>Jerri: And it's a nice one. <br/>Amber: Rolls. <br/>Elisabeth: Rounds? Like, not just one. <br/>Jeff: All right, let's go. âª  Jeff: Alicia! <br/>Alicia: Yeah, yo. <br/>Jeff: Take your shot. <br/>Go, Alicia! <br/>Alicia! <br/>Alicia! [ applause and cheering]  Rodger: Go! <br/>Jeff: Pick one weapon. <br/>Alicia: Just one? <br/>Jeff: Just one. All right, get up there, girl. <br/>Alicia: All right. <br/>Jeff: Give her a good run. âª  It's coming back. <br/>Jeff: Mark to beat, right here, Alicia. Next thrower. <br/>Keith: Come on, baby, come on, baby, come back to papa! Come on back to papa. <br/>Jeff: Alicia still the mark to beat. <br/>Alicia: No. to beat. <br/>Alicia: No. <br/>Alicia: It may be. <br/>No. <br/>Jeff: It's open. One decent toss, one good meal. Look at that. <br/>Alicia: That's a good one! <br/>Jerri! <br/>ALL: Yeah! [ applause and cheering]  Jeff: Nicely done. <br/>Tina: Good job! <br/>All right. [ indistinct chatter]  Jeff: It's gonna be tough to beat. Jerri, right here. <br/>Elisabeth: You've been hungry...  Tina: ...for the rest of this trip, if you get supper  tonight. <br/>Jerri: Oh, never. <br/>Tina: Okay? <br/>Jerri: If I get... supper! <br/>Jeff: South paw time. Big mark to beat. <br/>Nick: Jerri's getting hungry. <br/>Jerri: Ooh, that was good. <br/>JERRI &amp; Tina: Whoa! <br/>All right. <br/>Jeff: Jerri is still in the lead. <br/>Jerri: I'm so scared. <br/>Jeff: Give it a go, Rodger. <br/>Oh. <br/>Jerri: Oh! <br/>Jeff: Nope. Close. <br/>Rodger: Close, but no... no supper. <br/>Jeff: Jerri has the throw to beat. <br/>Amber: Up, next person. <br/>Jerri: Good luck, Amber. <br/>Alicia: All right, Amber. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Jerri: You're it, right? <br/>Amber: Yup. <br/>Alicia: It's you or Jerri. <br/>Jeff: One challenger left. <br/>Jerri: Oh, my God! <br/>Oh. <br/>Jeff: We better measure that. <br/>Jerri: Oh, my God. <br/>Alicia: Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: About an inch past 11...  Jerri: I am sweating. <br/>Tina: Don't even look. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Yup. Close, but no cigar. <br/>Amber: Jerri is the winner. <br/>Elisabeth: You got it. You have it. You have it. <br/>Jerri: Oh, my God. <br/>Amber: You beat me, like, a few inches. <br/>Elisabeth: Hungry girl, go now. <br/>Jeff: How ironic that you were the one who read the menu. <br/>Jerri: Yeah. <br/>Alicia: Yup. <br/>Jeff: Yeah. <br/>Jerri: That is kind of bizarre. <br/>Way to go, Jerri. <br/>Jeff: Anything on there interest you in particular? <br/>Jerri: Every last thing on there. <br/>Jeff: Yeah? <br/>Jerri: Yeah. <br/>Jeff: All right. Let's go eat. <br/>Jerri: Right now? <br/>Jeff: Yeah. <br/>Oh, have...  Bye. <br/>Bye. <br/>Jerri: This is bittersweet, though, really. [ all talking at once]  Colby: Please, come on. <br/>Jerri: No, I'm serious. <br/>Colby: We're going back to rice. What do you mean? Come on. <br/>Jerri: I know, everybody's hungry. <br/>Rodger: ...Your help with the rice tonight. <br/>Jerri: Okay, good. Good. [ indistinct chatter]  Jeff: You know, there is enough food for one more. Yeah, you should pick somebody else to come. <br/>Jerri: Who really, really, really, really wants this? <br/>Amber: We all do. <br/>We all...  You already won it. Just...  Jeff: Jerri, I think... Yeah, I think it's on you. <br/>Jerri, just pick. <br/>Just pick...  Just pick...  Jerri: Yeah. Amber. <br/>Amber: You picked me? <br/>Jerri: You-You got... You got the closest to me, and you  scared my pants. <br/>Amber: Thank you. <br/>Bye, guys. <br/>Bye, guys. <br/>Jerri: Oh, my God. I feel like I just won the Miss America pageant. <br/>Amber: I know. [ laughter]  Jeff: All right, let's head right over here. Wait until you guys see the setup. <br/>Jerri: Oh! <br/>Jeff: Jerri, you can have a seat over here. Amber... Have her slide in here. <br/>Amber: Oh, my God! Look at the rolls! Oh, my God. <br/>Jerri: You were just talking about rolls today. <br/>Amber: I love rolls! <br/>Jerri: Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Can this really be real? <br/>Amber: Oh, my God. <br/>Jerri: Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Cheers to you guys. Begin. <br/>Jerri: Cheers! <br/>Amber: Cheers. Thank you for choosing me. <br/>Jerri: Thank you! <br/>Amber: Oh, my God, is that so good! <br/>Jerri: Iced tea. <br/>Amber: Let's take our first bite. <br/>Jerri: Oh, my gosh, I'm eating a shrimp. <br/>Amber: Oh, my God. <br/>Jerri: I don't even care that my fingernails are  completely and totally dirty. <br/>Amber: There you go. [ Jerri laughs]  Amber: Oh, my God. <br/>Jerri: Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm. <br/>Amber: I'm gonna try the salmon. <br/>Jeff: So what's going on back at camp? <br/>Jerri: They're making rice over there, but they've got two  extra helpings of rice, so... [ laughs]  Jeff: Great trade off. <br/>Amber: Right, right. [ Amber laughs] Yeah. Things are going good, though, as far as, like, people getting  along and everything. <br/>Elisabeth: This is the first time since we got here that I  feel just, like, kind of just relaxed, hanging out. <br/>Keith: Isn't it nice? <br/>Elisabeth: Enjoying dinner. Yeah. <br/>Alicia: This is how it...  Keith: What's missing? What's making it feel that way? What could that be? How can I put my finger on that? [ someone gasps]  ...spaghetti. <br/>Alicia: You know what's kind of weird? <br/>Keith: The Wicked Witch of the West isn't here. <br/>Alicia: How could Amber have acted so...  Keith: That's what it is. <br/>Alicia: ...surprised that she was the beauty  queen...  Keith: It's all fake. <br/>Alicia: ...that knew she was going to win...  Keith: It's all fake. Yeah, exactly. <br/>Alicia: And-And, like, was, like, "Oh, my  god!"  Keith: Did you see...? <br/>Alicia: Did you see her face? I looked at her, like, "Okay, Amber."  Keith: You chose me?! <br/>Elisabeth: It was kind of funny, because everyone else  kind of felt like we won the reward. That was probably the one time I felt like Barramundi. We just kind of hung out. Everyone kind of vented about how they feel about Jerri, and it  was an eye-opener to some people. I knew it. <br/>Keith: Well, see, I cooked for two Presidents, I've cooked  for all kinds of people...  Elisabeth: Have you really? <br/>Keith: And I've never, ever, ever been stressed. Other than these last so many days. <br/>Isn't that weird?! <br/>Keith: Never been stressed. <br/>I can't believe that. <br/>Keith: Over cooking rice! <br/>Alicia: Over rice. <br/>Beautiful. <br/>Tina: I'm so excited. I love spaghetti. I'm so excited. <br/>Elisabeth: This isn't gonna make a difference to me. I'll have rice. Honestly, please, because... I'm not kidding. <br/>Tina: Thank you, Elisabeth. <br/>Elisabeth: One of my worst foods. <br/>Tina: You are so sweet. Thank you. Thank you for, like, Elisabeth, giving some of her spaghetti! [ laughs]  Elisabeth: I just haven't seen you enjoy anything like  this, Tina, like no reward...  Amber: Talk about Tina being extra chipper... She's had a  constant smile on her face since the merge. <br/>Jerri: Mm-hmm. <br/>Amber: She's been talking in a different voice. <br/>Jerri: I know. <br/>Amber: "Oh, you want to go do this? Want to go do that?" [ speaking gibberish] It's  unbelievable. She's a completely different person. <br/>Jerri: You got to really keep your eye on Tina, 'cause she  has been acting really weird. I'm, like, so sure that she's going to back stab us. <br/>Amber: Oh, I totally agree. <br/>Jerri: Well... and she'd be doing it with people who would  be ready to jump ship. <br/>Amber: Yeah. <br/>Jerri: Jump right on her ship. <br/>Amber: Mm-hmm. It's a completely different game. <br/>Jerri: Yeah. <br/>Amber: Isn't it weird? Playing for yourself is definitely different. <br/>Jerri: So, we need to talk to Colby. <br/>Amber: Yeah. <br/>Jerri: To making it to the end. <br/>Amber: Yeah. <br/>ELISABAETH: I just would never want to have to make that  decision. <br/>Colby: Hey, ladies. <br/>Jerri: Hi, you guys! <br/>Amber: Hi. We come bearing gifts. <br/>Jerri: You guys, we got boomerangs. There's one bent one and one straight one for everybody. <br/>Amber: Everybody gets two. It was very weird coming back to the tribe after we had eaten  our meal. Like, nobody even turned around to look at us. It was very uncomfortable. I didn't like the feeling at all. <br/>Tina: What kind of dessert did you get? <br/>Amber: I don't want to say anything. <br/>Jerri: I know. We-we feel... guilty. <br/>Tina: She doesn't want to hear it. We had a great time. Don't you feel bad at all. <br/>Colby: When Jerri and Amber came back, I made my way down  to the beach just to get some... grab some time alone, and Jerri came up, sat  down beside me and decided it was time for us to talk. <br/>Jerri: The next person Amber and my concern... with Tina  and Keith taking off and gathering three Kuchas...  Colby: Mm-hmm. <br/>Jerri: And coming after us. She said the same as me-- like, she wouldn't doubt it, after  that whole episode with Tina before. It's not good for us to just assume that we can trust her. Colby's kind of middle ground. Nobody really knows what he's... what he's going to do, and he's  not really letting anyone onto what his plans are. I mean, have you ever considered maybe... maybe, um... even  leading Keith and Tina to believe that you want the three of them to be the  final three? <br/>Colby: Keith and Tina? <br/>Jerri: Yeah. <br/>Colby: And myself? <br/>Jerri: Have you... have you ever thought maybe...? <br/>Colby: Oh, they're fully convinced that's what's going to  happen. <br/>Jerri: Oh, they are? <br/>Colby: I mean, they'vethey've-they've thought that  for...  Jerri: For a while? <br/>Colby: Before the merge, yeah. <br/>Jerri: Oh, really. <br/>COLBY; And that's been my...  Jerri: And you didn't tell me. <br/>Colby: Oh, I'm sorry. That's been my only bargain... That's been my only bargaining  chip. So, the inevitable came. I was painted into a corner and- and had to lie to her to  convince her that there wasn't anything going on. I just said, "Look, Jerri, Keith owes me one on this. "He and Tina think that the three of us are going into the  finals," which is the truth, but Jerri thinks it's just a ploy. You and I and Amber still have complete control of this thing. <br/>Jerri: Okay, 'cause I-I was completely unaware that, at  this point, you were leading Tina and Keith to believe that it was going to  be the three of you. <br/>Colby: I haven't held led 'em. They've assumed that. <br/>Jerri: Okay. <br/>Colby: Jerri doesn't deserve to win this thing, if for no  other reason, simply because of the way she's treated the people around her. And that was the biggest decision when I had to choose between  carrying my plans out with either Amber and Jerri or Keith and Tina. Yeah, everything's cool. <br/>Jerri: And this is the deal. <br/>Amber: Do you think it makes sense? <br/>Jerri: No, no, I didn't even, like, have to talk to him  about that. <br/>Amber: Oh, really? <br/>Jerri: Yeah, because he...  Amber: Okay, go. <br/>Jerri: He, um, filled me in on something I was completely  unaware of. <br/>Colby: Yeah. I didn't like the fact that I had to lie, but because I was  lying to Jerri, I didn't lose sleep over it. <br/>Amber: Give me a hug. I really owe you one. <br/>Colby: Are you so full of food, you can't? Is that tummy full right now, there? <br/>Jerri: I want a hug. <br/>Amber: The biggest it's ever been. <br/>Jerri: I buy it. I-I-I believe him, 'cause-'cause to him... to him, right now,  winning means everything. So, I mean, I'm... I'm looking at this whole thing right now as,  yes, we are working as a team to get to a specific point, and so that doesn't  leave me feeling very vulnerable at this point. <br/>Alicia: Oh, boy. Is that it? <br/>Nick: Bits and pieces. Want to open that? <br/>Alicia: No, let's go. Let's wait. <br/>Nick: Screw them. Open it now. <br/>Alicia: [ laughs] Hey, you guys, we got tree mail! <br/>Nick: Ah, let see what we got here. I love puzzles. <br/>Alicia: A-ha! One more. <br/>Nick: This is the last piece. Probably just a straight line, you guys. "When marking your land, there can be no doubt."  Alicia: "Just fence off your spot and keep others  out."  Nick: "You must plan ahead if you want to succeed. It's hip to be square, if it's immunity you need."  Alicia: Wow. <br/>Nick: What can it be? Very interesting. Uh, we got tree mail, and, uh, it says for our immunity  challenge, uh, we got to keep others out of your land and fence each...  everybody off. <br/>Amber: That is very interesting. <br/>Tina: Cool. What if it's like one of those...? <br/>Alicia: Whatever you think it is, think something else. <br/>Jerri: Right, right. Alicia right now is our biggest threat by far. She's got the guns, and she outstrengthens even the men. The men are sweating it right now over Alicia, so I think she...  she probably knows that, and it's probably very important to her to win  immunity right now. <br/>Rodger: Just... just hang in there and do your best,  kiddo. <br/>Alicia: Okay. <br/>Rodger: All we can... we can do. <br/>Alicia: That's it. <br/>Jeff: I'll take back the immunity necklace from you,  Keith. Put it right back here. Up for grabs again. Today's immunity challenge has nothing to do with age or  strength. It's all about how you think. We've created a challenge using posts and rope. The object of the game: connect the ropes to the poles to make  as many squares as possible. You'll each take turns connecting one rope at a time. If it's your rope that completes the square, you drop a disk in  it, you go again. Person with the most squares at the end wins immunity, cannot be  voted out at tonight's Tribal Council. Ready to go? Head over here to your disks, and we'll start. The order in which you'll take your turns we determined by  drawing numbers outs of a hat. Jerri, you're up. You're going to start it. Keith. All right, Amber, you're up. All right, Tina, you're up. Okay, Alicia, your turn. All right, Elisabeth. Go, Kentucky Joe. Let's go, Colby. All right, Nick. Okay, now it gets a little harder, 'cause any move you make's  going to either going to give you a box or set somebody else up for a run, so  choose wisely. A gift. First on the board. Somebody's going to have a good run in a minute. Getting tough out there. <br/>Alicia: It's getting tough. <br/>Elisabeth: You can all thank me later. Nick can thank me now. <br/>Jeff: Nick has one. Amber has one. <br/>Colby: Did you leave Rodger a square? <br/>Nick: No. <br/>Colby: Come on, Rodg, help your brother out. <br/>Jeff: Now you're brothers. <br/>Rodger: Yeah. <br/>Colby: Me and Rodg-- we go way back. <br/>Rodger: All family now. <br/>Colby: Four days. <br/>Jeff: No box for Rodger. Let's see what he left for Colby. Colby has one. See if he gets another one. Colby has two. <br/>Colby: There you go, Jerri. <br/>Jeff: Looks like Jerri's on a run. Oh, that hurts. Good run. Six. Jerri in the lead. Keith is anxiously awaiting your next move. <br/>Jerri: I'm sure he is. <br/>Jeff: Nine. Keith, you hit the jackpot. I guess you have Jerri to thank for that. 15. <br/>Amber: Girl, you set him up. <br/>Jerri: Yes, I did. <br/>Jeff: 16. 17. <br/>Keith: All good things come to an end, though. <br/>Jerri: I want a massage. <br/>Jeff: Good run. Keith in the lead with 17. <br/>Jerri: Whoo! <br/>Jeff: Amber, think you can make a dent in Keith's 17? <br/>Amber: I got 'em all, right? <br/>Rodger: Yeah, you got 'em all. <br/>Amber: Ah, this is killing me! <br/>Tina: It's killing me too. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Amber: Oh, you guys. <br/>Jeff: Tina has a plan. 14. 15. 16. All right, Tina, you got 16. Keith's got 17. You got to find one more spot on the board. This is for immunity. <br/>Tina: Yep, and I think that's all of mine. <br/>Jeff: Good effort, Tina. Not good enough. Mathematically impossible for Keith to be beat. Nicely done, Keith. You get the immunity necklace again. Congratulations. <br/>Tina: Good job. <br/>Jeff: Feels good, doesn't it? You're getting used to that. All right, you guys can head back to camp. I'll see you tonight at Tribal Council, where one of you will be  voted out of the tribe. Somebody's going home tonight. <br/>Elisabeth: Lightning. <br/>Tina: Whoa, that was close. [ thunder rumbling] [ lightning crashes]  Rodger: I love it here in the Australian outback! Whoo-hoo! <br/>Keith: Mysteriously, every time we go to Tribal Council,  we have a rainstorm. I don't know what that means, but you have to think there's  something working there of stronger powers than we're aware of. <br/>Alicia: Elisabeth thinks that the next vote at Tribal  Council will go for Jerri. I think Elisabeth is naive in a lot of ways. You know, Colby and Keith and Tina would be foolish to vote  Jerri off. It would put them at a disadvantage. So Nick and I both feel like it's going to be one of us that  they're targeting. <br/>Elisabeth: I'm hoping that that swing vote to get Jerri  off is Tina. But I really think Jerri is a goner tonight. And I just want to keep playing. I'm not ready to go home. I'm not ready to see my friends go, either. Tribal Council is going to be much more interesting than the  last, and... who knows what is going to happen? <br/>Jeff: Always seems to rain at Tribal Council. Elisabeth, talk about the tribes merging, now that you've had a  few days. Has it been an interesting dynamic in two different ways of  living coming together now and forming a new way of living? <br/>Elisabeth: It has. It's been quite interesting. I mean, I think that we probably couldn't have done things in a  more opposite way when you look at the two tribes. I-I just think that the differences are known. I mean, sometimes it's tricky, and you get used to doing things  your own way, but, um, then you realize that, well, there might be a more  efficient way also, so there's been compromise, and I think it's worked to  our benefit as a group so far. <br/>Jeff: What was the reaction last night, Amber, when you  and Jerri came back with little bellies from a nice meal? <br/>Amber: It was a very weird feeling, a guilty kind of  feeling, and I couldn't help but feel like somewhat of an outsider for a  little while. <br/>Jeff: So, what was it like for you guys not having two  people around last night? Different feeling, Alicia? <br/>Alicia: It was interesting going back to camp just having  seven people. It was, you know, a little quieter, and everybody was, you know,  kind of contemplating the situation, and... and our situation. Uh, a lot of us had already resigned ourselves to the fact that  we'd be having rice that night, so, um... it was... it was all good. <br/>Jeff: Well, you nine have reached... really the final  phase: the last leg of Survivor. Someone will be voted out of the tribe tonight, but they don't  go home. They become a part of that jury, and will have a big part in how  this thing plays out, because the jury will ultimately decide who the winner  is. You each have, right now, a one in nine shot at a million bucks. So, this game is really shifted now. The goal is get to the final two with the goodwill of the other  seven. Every vote from here on out counts, so you better think about  that when you're casting your vote, because the game has changed. Let's vote. Elisabeth, you're first. <br/>Elisabeth: Tonight I'm voting for Jerri. I just feel it's her time to go, and she gets really cranky when  she's hungry, and it's bumming me out a little. <br/>Amber: My vote's for Alicia, and girl, you're strong  inside and out. That's the main reason why I have to vote for you-- because  you're threatening. So, this is a respect vote, and I'm going to miss you a lot. <br/>Rodger: Nice kid, but way too loud. Way too loud. <br/>Jerri: Alicia, not only do Way too loud. <br/>Jerri: Alicia, not only do you intimidate the hell out of  the women around here, but also the men. They are scared to death of you. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. [ music playing] Once the votes are tallied, the [ music  playing] Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final, the person will  be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Jerri. Very muscular... [ laughing] Alicia. <br/>Alicia: Who did that? Who did that? <br/>Jeff: Jerri. Alicia. Alicia. Alicia. Jerri. Jerri. Four votes Jerri, four votes Alicia. Final vote... Alicia. Alicia, you need to bring me your torch. <br/>Alicia: Okay. Listen, bear in mind, be safe, everybody here. <br/>See you in three days. <br/>Alicia: See you all in three days. Thank you; thanks, guys. Thank you, sweetie. Be good. <br/>Jeff: Alicia, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. <br/>Alicia: Bye, guys. <br/>Jeff: Grab your torches and head back to camp. Good night. [ music playing]  Alicia: I have to say that I was expecting this. We knew there was going to be a threat, and I just hope somebody  from Kucha can take this thing out and break Ogakor's spirit. It's all good, though. Now I get to sit on the jury and watch everything that happens. Peace, out.
