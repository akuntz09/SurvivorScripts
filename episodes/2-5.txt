<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor,Keith and Tina plotted to  take down Jerri. <br/>Tina: She's the most bossy, domineering person I've ever  met. <br/>Keith: I didn't come out here to be pushed around by a  bartender-wannabe-actress. <br/>Jeff: Jerri persuaded Colby to make a deal. <br/>Colby: It's me, you and Amber, through to the end. <br/>Jerri: It's not like you're making a deal with the devil  here. <br/>Colby: I simply agreed to go along with them to get me  down the road a little better. <br/>Jeff: Kimmi's morals were compromised when the tribe won  chickens in a reward challenge. <br/>Kimmi: Don't break her wings, though. Can't they give us some edamame, some tofu...? <br/>Jeff: Michael shocked his tribe by killing a pig. <br/>Kimmi: We live in a sick tribe. <br/>Elisabeth: We're going to get strong now. <br/>Jeff: Kucha continued their winning streak by taking the  immunity challenge, sending Ogakor back to Tribal Council for the third  consecutive time, where the vote was deadlocked in a double tie between Keith  and Mitchell. One vote is the difference. But ultimately it was Mitchell who was voted out, putting a dent  in Jerri's hopes for an alliance. 12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? [ birds chirping]  Colby: We really started [ birds chirping]  Colby: We really started noticing the smoke and hearing  the trees explode and crash. Uh, yesterday, I guess, is when it got the closest to us. And now we're just completely pretty much overtaken by smoke. <br/>Amber: My eyes are watering. <br/>Tina: It's just extremely hazy and smoky, and... It's an  interesting morning. <br/>Amber: We've had an interesting past couple of days, as  far as, uh... Let's see, our last Tribal Council we lost Mitchell, which was  a surprise. <br/>Jerri: It was a pretty... pretty traumatic evening. I think our little group of common voters has been busted up. It's a whole new ball game right now. <br/>Keith: Love this game. <br/>JERRI [ half-whispering]: Tina and Keith are definitely  grouped together, but Colby is like the one in the middle, like...  Amber: They're totally grouping together. <br/>Jerri: Everybody else is trying to pair up, or they're  trying... We're all vying for Colby's vote. <br/>Colby: I'm playing from the center, dude. I'm playing from... [ Keith laughing] Let's squash this one. <br/>Amber: Seems like since Tina was able to get Colby to sway  his vote last time and vote for Mitchell, seems like maybe he, uh, might sway  again to their side. But we're almost kind of fighting over him. <br/>Colby: What we did was strategic, and it was to help the  team out, and I know it did that. <br/>Jerri: I have, you know... I'm not harboring any ill  feelings whatsoever about the whole deal. We still are more powerful if the three of us are voting the  same. <br/>Colby: I'm still voting just like I did last night, based  on who the strongest... who I think's got what it takes to make it in. Maybe tomorrow, I might be thinking a whole lot different,  but... right now I'm not. <br/>Jerri: I mean, it's basically the end of any alliance,  pretty much. <br/>Colby: Jerri, I don't care. I don't care about that stage of it. I mean, all I care about is doing everything we can to win the  next two immunity challenges. That's the only thing I can focus on right now. <br/>Kimmi: Good morning, stinkies. We gotta clean you out, 'cause you all stink. Last night was a very uncomfortable sleeping night. It was drafty, it was cold. Nobody slept last night. Like, it was just like one of those nights where anything and  everything that could wake you up did. <br/>Jeff V.: I woke up once, and there was a hot coal on my  shirt-- look. <br/>Rodger: You're kidding? <br/>Jeff V.: And there was a little fire in my wooly. <br/>Nick: Whew! <br/>Alicia: "Fire in my woolly." That's not the  first time I heard that. Well, how the hell did it bypass everybody else in front of you? <br/>Jeff V.: I don't know, but if it came all the way back  here, it could have landed on your face. <br/>Michael: That's exactly right. <br/>Jeff V.: Know what I'm saying? <br/>Alicia: That's not funny. <br/>Jeff V.: It's not funny. The fire had been popping coals out of the fire onto us. <br/>Alicia: Wow. <br/>Jeff V.: So, we had to move our fire this morning. It just was getting a little too dangerous. <br/>Kimmi: Very good chickens. They're very happy now. Hello, hello...  Jeff V.: We got fire! <br/>Rodger: It was a little inconvenient right there, you  know, but boy, late at night, nighttime, be... Gonna be different around  there when it gets cold at night. I guess we're ready to go. Chicken killing time. <br/>Alicia: You know what, though? That hatchet needs to be sharpened. It's pretty dull again. <br/>Rodger: Mike got the pig, and, uh, we ate real good. We wasn't able to save all the meat, so I guess we're going to  eat chicken. So, we won't have the eggs. [ scraping continues] Sharp as possible while we're... while  we're doing the chicken in. <br/>Kimmi: Hello, ladies. I have such brilliant hens over here, yes...  Michael: I just tell Kimmi, "For your own  self-preservation, let go of the chicken thing. Stop talking about them, stop getting involved..."  Kimmi: What's going over  Nick: We're building a fire to boil water, to kill the  chicken. [ clucking]  Kimmi: Well, that's my cue. <br/>Michael: Yeah, we're ready. <br/>Kimmi: See you later, bye. <br/>Michael: Stop making a big spectacle when you leave. "Oh, you're butchering the chickens, I'm out of here!"  Da-da-da-da-da! You know, I mean, it's just... It's too theatrical, it's just  too much. <br/>Kimmi: Bye, chickies, bye-bye. <br/>Michael: I'm ready. I'm feeling the need to shed some blood. <br/>Alicia: Whatever. [ indistinct voices]  Rodger: I don't... I don't, I don't enjoy killing animals,  neither. <br/>Elisabeth: Sure. <br/>Rodger: I don't, really, but sometimes, nobody wants to do  it. Jeff, you want to do it? <br/>Michael: I thought Jeff wanted to do it. <br/>Elisabeth: Maybe next time. <br/>Rodger: You got it? [ pounding, moaning]  Elisabeth: I like that. Get these feathers off. <br/>Jeff V.: Oh, they're hot. <br/>Rodger: Yeah, this is by far the right...  Elisabeth: Good stuff. That chicken's going to be so awesome...  Alicia: It's gonna be so good. [ indistinct voices]  Amber: Thank you. <br/>Keith: You're welcome. <br/>Amber: The food situation could definitely be better. It could always get better. We're not eating that much at all. We're definitely not eating as much as the other tribe is. <br/>Jerri: When you come to see me, we have to go somewhere  and get a really good pizza. <br/>Amber: Okay. <br/>Jerri: And lots of garlic and bread... We haven't caught  any fish for, I think, two days now. The whole hunger thing, that for me has been a huge hurdle. Keith, did you disassemble some of these for the line the other  night? The only ones that are rigged to go are the cricket and the  silver one. <br/>Keith: Jerri went to go fishing, and she needed the can. And of course, she hollered out to me, like her older sibling. <br/>Jerri: What do you suggest we do with the fish guts? <br/>Keith: I said we'll take them to the end and dump them in  the water, like we've been doing it. And so, she brought them down to the water's edge down at the  end of camp to dump them out, and then she yelled back that it's not a smart  idea to dump them in there, because...  Jerri: We're literally feeding the fish every time we dump  the guts down there. <br/>Keith: Well, my vote is you just bury them in the sand  down by the end down there. <br/>Jerri: The thing is, it's also downwind from us, so once  they start rotting, if by chance you get a second, if you want to...  Keith: I'll bury them. <br/>Jerri: Yeah? <br/>Keith: No problem. <br/>Jerri: That would be really cool. <br/>Keith: It's all right. I'm thinking on these couple hundred acres of water, I'm not  sure that a few fish eating some dead fish is going to matter a whole lot,  but whatever. <br/>Jerri: It's just ridiculous to me to continue to dump the  guts at the end of our beach. We're literally feeding the fish. It's no wonder we haven't been able to catch anything, they're  all full. <br/>Keith: It's not that big of a deal, but apparently... it  was. I don't stand up to her that often, 'cause I don't find it  necessary, 'cause it's more exhausting to argue with her than anything. The fish... are now... buried. Dead fish. <br/>Jerri: We haven't been catching fish again, and the other  team is eating chickens and pigs and eggs, you know. And here we are over here, starving to death. <br/>Keith: You have any? <br/>Jerri: No luck. Those are the things that I didn't really think going into this  that were going to bother me. But it has. <br/>Kimmi: ...something really different. <br/>Alicia: No, no, I didn't get upset about you; I left. <br/>Kimmi: No, my point is, is that with the, uh, chicken, I'm  just saying for these guys to stay stronger, it's better to, like, do  everyother day, putting meat in their body. <br/>Alicia: You gotta be kidding? <br/>Kimmi: I don't know. <br/>Alicia: We're active every day, we need protein every day. <br/>Kimmi: No, my points is...  Alicia: That's not a good argument, it's not gonna work. <br/>Kimmi: This isn't like a debate to be arguing about. <br/>Alicia: No, I know. <br/>Kimmi: I'm just saying...  Alicia: But I'm telling you why I don't agree with you. That's exactly the point. <br/>Kimmi: Okay, well, you don't have to agree with me. <br/>Alicia: And I don't. So, there you go. <br/>Kimmi: Okay, fine. <br/>Alicia: I'm tired of the chickens, tired of it. <br/>Kimmi: Excuse me? <br/>Alicia: Do you have some kind of a problem? <br/>Kimmi: Yeah, I have a problem with your attitude. <br/>Alicia: Oh really!? <br/>Kimmi: What the hell is up your butt? <br/>Alicia: What you just said is not true. We should be having protein every day. If we have to have the chickens, we will. <br/>Kimmi: I'm just saying, if you had the chickens  here...  Alicia: Right! You see us going fishing, right? <br/>Kimmi: You can go... That's all I was saying-- it's a good  just thing to break it up, especially...  Alicia: You are the defensive one about the chickens, not  me, so do not yell at me about the chickens. <br/>Kimmi: I am not getting emotionally attached. <br/>Alicia: You can get as emotionally attached as you want. Because the only reason why we said it is 'cause we care about  your feelings 'cause you're part in this tribe. But don't jump all over me, sweetheart, don't ever...  Kimmi: But the thing is, I'm not getting upset. Don't wave your finger in my face. <br/>Alicia: I will always wave my finger...  Kimmi: And mumble under your breath. <br/>Alicia: You want me to say it to your face? <br/>Kimmi: Yes, if you have...  Alicia: Yes, I will be happy to. I'm saying it to your face right now. <br/>Kimmi: Thank you! <br/>Alicia: I'm tired of you and the... chickens-- you heard  it! <br/>Kimmi: What have I said about the chickens, though? Nothing! That's the problem. <br/>Alicia: Please, you and your little... [ didgeridoo  playing]  Kimmi: She has more of an issue with the chickens than I  do. Gosh! <br/>Alicia: I don't really appreciate her to begin with, so  for me to try to walk away from a situation I know is potentially going to  turn ugly, and her not to let me do that, made me want to just run up and  grab her by the throat. But I-I had to keep my wits about me, because that's not what  this is about. <br/>Jeff V.: What did I just miss? I was peeing? <br/>Alicia: Plenty. I've never liked Kimmi, we all know that. So when she jumps on me, I will go at her guns loaded, okay? <br/>Jeff V.: What did she say, though? I totally missed it. What happened? <br/>Alicia: Sitting on the floor of the house, she  goes...  Kimmi: Alicia has always had a problem with me. She said, "Kimmi, don't get too attached to the  chickens." I'm like, "I'm not getting attached to the  chickens." Like, don't worry! I'm a big girl. I said, "You know, while we have the chickens here we  shouldn't just eat four chickens and a pig back-to-back days. <br/>Alicia: I said, "You know what, Kimmi? This is why we didn't want you to get emotionally attached to  the chickens." That's all I said. <br/>Kimmi: She's very critical of other people, she's very  condescending of other people, and I will not be treated, um, you know, like  a jerk-off. <br/>ALICIA [ scoffing]: Give me a break. If you're going to make sense, you can say whatever you want to  me, but if you're not going to make sense, keep your mouth shut. <br/>Jeff V.: I knew that that Alicia/Kimmi explosion was  coming, I knew it was coming. Kimmi was befriending the chickens and giving them names and  petting them. And, um, Alicia just has no patience. Alicia doesn't have a lot of patience for anybody, really. <br/>Alicia: I had enough, and I let loose, baby. <br/>Elisabeth: Alicia is in charge of telling people to do  things. Alicia is also in charge of talking trash about people. <br/>Alicia: We still have to stay together as a team. <br/>Elisabeth: We do. <br/>Alicia: So I'm willing to live and let live. <br/>Kimmi: I just think it was a silly misunderstanding. But we all are on the same team, so we gotta... at least have a  poker face on for game day, I suppose. [ birds squawking]  Nick: This fire doesn't throw off the heat that the other  fire did. <br/>Alicia: This is the only time, though, when the fire  really stinks, you know...  Nick: We moved the fire pit away from our camp for some  safety reasons. And we had it nice and close-- about five feet from where we all  sleep, so it was really warm at night. But we moved it away, and last night was really, really cold. <br/>Rodger: Coldest night for me. Whew! <br/>Nick: You know, what can we do? We don't have any blankets, so then we just bundle up. <br/>Alicia: Come on over to the fire. <br/>Rodger: Cold on that outside...  Michael: Let me tell you, it was cold on the inside, so if  it was cold on the inside...  Rodger: Oh...  Kimmi: The water here grosses  Rodger: Oh...  Kimmi: The water here grosses me out more than anything. This Crocodile Creek is food and bathroom to fish and crocodiles  and birds and bats, and, you know all kinds of algae and bacteria. And it's just... I don't know, I just find it to be incredibly  gross. <br/>Michael: Kimmi, I don't know if she's been in the water  once, and... the dirt's starting to stick to her. <br/>Kimmi: But also 'cause you can see my tan line-- look at  it. <br/>Michael: You know, some, one of the other girls puts on a  different top, you'll see a tan line. When Kimmi puts on a different top, you'll see a dirt line. <br/>Kimmi: I washed yesterday. <br/>Michael: You changed clothes. I mean, your neck is, like, filthy. <br/>Kimmi: Filthy, well be... Oh, because I was carrying tree  stuff today. That's why my neck is filthy. <br/>Michael: And then she got real defensive about it. I said "I'm..." I said, "If I had a booger  hanging out of my nose, and you told me about it, I would say 'thank you.' I  wouldn't get all mad at you."  Kimmi: That's nice. <br/>Michael: I mean, it's not bad. I mean, we're all dirty. <br/>Rodger: Whew! <br/>Elisabeth: It's a big one! <br/>Nick: Is it FedEx? <br/>Elisabeth: Feels like a package. <br/>Nick: Wow. <br/>Elisabeth: It's a book! <br/>Nick: It's a catalog. <br/>Elisabeth: Check this thing out! <br/>Michael: That is stylin'! <br/>Kimmi: Wow! <br/>Elisabeth: Okay, "You must be prepared when your  tribe's in a bind. Build a travois, and save their behinds..."  Jeff V.: Build a what? <br/>Elisabeth: Build a tra...  Nick: A stretcher thing. <br/>Elisabeth: Like a stretcher "...and save their  behinds. Look through this book. You can only choose two. Plus from your friends at Target... clean teeth and  shampoo!"  Kimmi: Shampoo! Oh! <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God, you guys! <br/>Nick: We get to pick two things, we get to pick two  things. <br/>Elisabeth: Okay, boxers and slippers? <br/>Kimmi: No. <br/>Elisabeth: We'll skip that page. Toilet paper? <br/>Nick: Blankets, we need blankets. <br/>Elisabeth: Blankets I think is one, don't you? <br/>Rodger: Blankets would be...  Alicia: Blankets would be wonderful, 'cause we really--  now that we moved our fire...  Michael: I think we're all...  Alicia: ...we really have an issue with that. <br/>Elisabeth: Yeah. <br/>Rodger: Everybody wants the spices? <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, it is a catalog...  Rodger: Raise your hand. Everybody wants spices who... what do you want? Spices? I'll go with spices. <br/>Elisabeth: The two items that we chose... we definitely  need blankets. Last night was really cold. I had a miserable night's sleep. I don't know if anyone really slept through, especially without  our fire out here, it's so cold. We are going to choose for the second item spices, and we get  toothpaste and shampoo when we win this today. <br/>Alicia: "Travois." They're using some French  words. <br/>Nick: A stretcher. <br/>Alicia: It's a stretcher, to carry somebody in. <br/>Michael: Look how they show the thing, though. It's not like what you'd think. It's a teepee... it's a triangle. <br/>Alicia: Yeah, it's a tri...  Elisabeth: Wow! <br/>Nick: We have to make one of these, you guys. So, how are we going to build this thing? Let's think. <br/>Kimmi: Yes? <br/>Alicia: We could even make something out of rope for her  feet to sit in. <br/>Elisabeth: We could have addins, like a pillow...  Rodger: If we use that bamboo pole, how are we going to  tie onto that? <br/>Alicia: Those up there are going to start to cross. <br/>Kimmi: Is that real hard wood? <br/>Elisabeth: That can go right under my butt. <br/>Jeff V.: That's the width. We want the length. <br/>Michael: Keep it tight where you guys had it, at the top. <br/>Rodger: Can you come around this and tie a bunch of  slipknots in? <br/>Elisabeth: Is that on your head? <br/>Kimmi: Yeah, but that's okay. <br/>Alicia: We're gonna need it for the back corner...  Rodger: Are your legs still where you can reach the  corners? Or you need to slide down a little bit? <br/>Alicia: Rock solid. <br/>Michael: One, two, lift. [ Elisabeth laughs]  Alicia: Feels stable enough? <br/>Kimmi: Mm-hmm. <br/>Elisabeth: Whee! <br/>Rodger: All right, we got it down. <br/>Elisabeth: I think over at, uh, Ogakor, they're probably  trying to pull it together really well. We have to go out there as if we're facing a tribe just as  strong as we are. <br/>Amber: Who's gonna decide do we want to make it like a  rectangle...? <br/>Jerri: All right, here, give me the goods, then just  hold... You hold onto that end, and as I weave it just follow-follow me with  this. <br/>Colby: We're dragging this thing. We want the least amount of friction we can get. <br/>Jerri: Okay, so what's your point? What's wrong with this? <br/>Colby: I'm saying...  Jerri: Do you see what I'm doing with this, though? <br/>Colby: Exactly, and I think it's great. I'm saying instead of starting it over the top, start it  underneath. <br/>Amber: From underneath. <br/>Colby: You see what I'm saying? <br/>Keith: We got two pieces...  Jerri: No, I don't see what you're saying. You guys want to, like, put her in it and pick it up-- the four  of us-- just to see what happens? I got kind of tickled when making the travois. I knew that the idea I had would work, and everybody was just  kind of standing around and talking. And no one was doing anything. So I just kind of grabbed the bull by the horns. God bless America... this...  Keith: I have probably a little more patience than Colby  does. But I can usually tell when he's getting a little tense and a  little agitated, you know. He'll walk away from it and just take a breath. <br/>Jerri: Let's try it this way, just in case we're able to. <br/>Amber: Is it really bad? <br/>Jerri: Yay, it works! <br/>Tina: Ooh! <br/>Jerri: Oh! <br/>Colby: The toughest part for this tribe is coming into  these challenges with our guns blazing, ready to rock. We gotta win this thing, and we still got a shot at doing it. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right, well, we've already established how tough it is  living in the Outback. You're battling-- among other things-- an out of control fire,  wildlife, crocodiles, snakes, spiders. If you get hurt, you are a long way from help. You have to be able to rely on your tribe mates to get you back  to safety. That's where today's challenge comes in: triage. You were asked to build a travois-- a three-sided stretcher. You're going to use that today. Two members from each tribe will be the rescuers. Three members will be the victims. You'll be placed at three different spots out here on the river  on little sand spits. There's a flag designating the area. There is a circle around that flag. The victims will stand inside that circle. When the rescuers get out there, you get on your travois and you  head back. Once they cross this line and they're okay, they are  miraculously healed, they become a rescuer. Now you have three. Going for the next person. First tribe to get all three of their victims back to the first  aid camp wins reward. Now, Kucha, because you guys have two extra members, two people  will sit out. The winning tribe gets what they wanted and also what the other  tribe wanted. [ all groaning]  Elisabeth: Shut up! <br/>Jeff: So, Kucha, you chose the blankets and the spices. Ogakor, you also chose the spaces and the soup mix. <br/>Alicia: It's a beautiful thing. <br/>Jeff: And Target has thrown in a few other items. They're not necessities, these are luxuries. Got fresh toothbrush... [ murmuring]  Amber: Oh, my gosh! <br/>JEFF ...toothpaste, deodorant. <br/>Rodger: Oh, yeah, we could use that. <br/>Jeff: And of course, what every survivor needs, shampoo. [ all cheering]  Elisabeth: Wow! <br/>Amber: Oh, my God. <br/>Elisabeth: That's awesome. <br/>Jeff: Okay, you guys decide who is going to sit out. Decide on your rescuers and your victims. Wait for my start. <br/>Tina: Go, Ogakor! Come on, guys! <br/>Jeff: Kimmi and Rodger, you're sitting out for Kucha. A lot of reward at stake. Survivors, ready... Go! <br/>Tina: Go, go, go, go! <br/>Dude, come here. <br/>Go, go, go, go, go! Pick it up! <br/>Kimmi: Go, Kucha! <br/>Alicia: Guys, push, push, push, push, push! Get ahead! [ team members yelling]  Elisabeth: Kucha! <br/>Jerri: Ogakor! [ yelling, shouting]  Jerri: Ogakor! [ yelling, shouting]  Rodger: You're ahead! [ yelling, shouting]  Michael: Walk through! <br/>Elisabeth: Okay, okay. <br/>Good job, Kucha! <br/>Rodger: Good job, all right! <br/>Jeff: Congratulations. Nice job, Kucha. <br/>It's all yours. <br/>Good job. <br/>Jeff: Here we go, guys. <br/>Nick: Here's blankets. <br/>Rodger: All right. [ happy shouting]  All right, all right. <br/>Amber: I'm just so tired of losing. [ sniffling, crying]  Tina: Don't let 'em break your spirit now. <br/>Colby: I am getting very frustrated with losing. If we don't turn up the heat and turn this runaway train around,  then it may be a meltdown for the Colbster. <br/>Tina: It's not the things you lose, it's just losing. You know, it takes such a psychological hit on your already  psychologically tired body that, for our team, it's definitely the loss that  hits us hard. <br/>Alicia: Winning the reward challenges is, basically, just  one more nail in the coffin. Not as important as immunity, but another thing that's gonna  sink them just a little bit lower. <br/>Jeff V.: I don't mean to sound evil, but it's all about  kicking somebody's ass. <br/>Alicia: There's no way they're gonna give up. They were very graceful losers, actually. I'm just so glad we're not them right now. That's rough. <br/>Jeff V.: Some of the people in the tribe are talking about  how guilty they feel and how bad they feel for the other tribe-- and screw  it! I mean, chop their heads off, chop their legs off, this is a  game and I'm ready to beat every one of them. I'm ready to chop their heads off and their eyeballs out so Mike  can eat them... [ laughter]  Jeff V.: I stink. <br/>Elisabeth: Me, too. <br/>Alicia: Toothpaste and toothbrush and shampoo and  deodorant. I'm not going to know what to do with myself. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my gosh! Shampoo that doubles as soap. <br/>Jeff V.: Let's go wash. <br/>Michael: Everybody else smells out here, but everybody  else bathes. Thank God we won that challenge, so that we can bathe Kimmi. <br/>Michael: Group bath. We won the reward challenge yesterday and we used the shampoo--  we each got a handful, and we just all soaped up, 'cause the camp was getting  a little stinky. Some more than others, because some people bathe more than  others around here-- but it was fun. <br/>Rodger: You've got to prove that. [ laughter]  Amber: We got mail! "This next challenge will prove harder than the rest,  You'll be rats in the maze for this little test. Just keep your wits and you'll make it with ease, The prize is  the idol and that's much better than cheese."  Jerri: Oh, a maze! <br/>Amber: I think we should have a little pep talk. Well, I think... today, I don't think it's our strength is going  to get us through this challenge. I honestly think it's our minds and our hearts, and if we all  believe we can do it. I definitely think we can. So just make sure that you don't doubt your heart and your mind  at all today, and I think that will get us through it. <br/>Jerri: There's a lot of pressure on us today-- a lot. But let's not forget also to have fun with this. <br/>Colby: It is going to take every ounce of keenness, of  smarts, of strength, of everything we have. The excuses are done, check them at the door and let's get down  to business. It is going to be one hell of a show today and it's... you know,  I think we're as ready as we're going to be. <br/>Jerri: All right, Ogabkor. Here we go! Let's do this! <br/>Jeff: I'll take that. Let's do this! <br/>Jeff: I'll take that. Once again, give it up, Varner. The immunity idol is back up for grabs. Here's the deal today: A giant maze. 46 tons of lumber, three miles of burlap, two weeks to build. Each maze is identical. Inside each maze, five totem poles-- attached to each totem pole  are these medallions. They're numbered, one, two, three, four, five. Working as a unit, your goal is to get through the maze,  collecting the medallions in order. One first, then two, then three. If you find five first, don't grab it. Once you've collected all five, get out of the maze on the other  side. First tribe to the immunity idol wins immunity. It's about 110 degrees today. Should work up a nice lather. Kucha, because there's no obvious advantage or disadvantage to  having more members in this, you'll run the full seven. All right, we'll get going. <br/>ALL: One, two, three, Ogakor! <br/>ALL: Kucha! <br/>Jeff: All right, immunity at stake! Survivors ready... Go! <br/>Colby: Go back, go back. <br/>Tina: Go back, go back. <br/>Keith: Dead end-- go back, go back. <br/>Straight-- this way. <br/>Nick: I see one, I see one, I just don't know how to get  there. There's two. There's two in the far right corner. Keep moving on-- this way, this way. We all together? <br/>Yeah. <br/>All right. <br/>Colby: Work around to the right. <br/>Right here. <br/>Colby: Got it, got one. Two is over there. Go! <br/>Jeff V.: No, it's right here. One! One! One! Okay, where was two? <br/>Far right corner. <br/>Far right corner. <br/>This way, this way! No, to the left, this way. <br/>I'm right here! <br/>He's over here! <br/>No, you're going nowhere! It's this way! <br/>Come here, come here. Is somebody here? <br/>Colby: We found three. <br/>No...  All right, it's got to be in the back corner. <br/>Back up? <br/>Back, all the way in the corner. Go... come on. <br/>Here we go, here we go, here we go. <br/>Jeff! <br/>I got two right here. <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Good job, good job. <br/>Yeah, we lost three...  Three's back that way...  Go, go, go. <br/>Other way-- right there. <br/>Straight? Straight. <br/>Right there. <br/>Keith: It's right in here. Come back. It's right here. This... Right there. Go around this way. <br/>Jerri: That's three. <br/>Keith: Four is in the front right corner, five is in the  middle. Come on, Amber. <br/>Go, Keith, go. <br/>Go on, go on, go on, go on! <br/>Nick: Mike, I think we got to go all the way back down. <br/>Yeah, that way. <br/>Go all the way down... [ all talking]  Jerri: Come on, you guys, we got it. <br/>Left? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Colby: I see it. It's right there. <br/>Amber: Right here, guys! <br/>Go, go, go, go. All right, all right. <br/>Yeah...  Go, go! <br/>Michael: I got it, I got it. Got it, got it, got it. No, no, no, right here. It's right here. We just gotta get there from that way. It's right there. We got to get to it from that side, though. <br/>Nick: Can't we go around that way? <br/>Amber: Where is it? Here it is! <br/>Go, go. <br/>Which way? <br/>It's that way... This is it, this is it. We gotta go. <br/>Colby: Tina, don't get lost! Tina, Tina, come here! <br/>Tina: Okay, I see your flag! <br/>Come back, Tina. <br/>No, dead end, dead end! <br/>Turn around! <br/>I'm right behind you! <br/>Come on... Come on! <br/>I'm here, I'm here. <br/>Tina: We're here. <br/>Go, go! <br/>Tina: We're out! We're out! <br/>Come on! Go, go, go! Hurry up! [ screaming]  Colby: Yes! [ cheering, whooping]  Jeff: Yesterday, sitting in the water, Amber, tears  rolling down your face, you said, "I'm sick of losing."  Amber: Do you see any tears right now? If they were, they'd be tears of joy. <br/>Jeff: Congratulations! All right, guys, you can head back. Kucha, see you tonight at the Tribal Council. <br/>Alicia: Exactly, that's the Tribal Council. <br/>Alicia: Exactly, that's the only way. <br/>Jeff V.: You get on my nerves, and I don't care...  Alicia: I know, sweetie. <br/>Jeff V.: Stickin' to it. We are not a happy tribe. We are not the family we appear to be. There is some animosity. <br/>Alicia: She causes so much trouble within the tribe, as  well. <br/>Jeff V.: That's a name I'm going to be happy to write  down. <br/>Alicia: Yeah, me, too. <br/>Kimmi: I'm sure Jeff and Alicia are gonna vote together,  and you've been spending a lot of time with them-- I figure you guys are  going to vote together,  Michael: Who? <br/>Kimmi: You, Alicia and Jeff. <br/>Michael: I'm not in their pact. I'm not in their thing. <br/>Alicia: Tribal Council is a drag, no matter which way you  look at it. It's clear-cut who should go, but they stay a little longer and  then somebody steps up and looks like they should go. So, for me, Kimmi is a physical weakness, and she just makes the  most sense right now, because I have personal problems with her. We just clash. <br/>Rodger: It could be very interesting, Tribal Council. Right now, I assume that they think that I'm voting against  Kimmi. More than likely, that probably will not be the case. The only person that I keep my word with out here is Elisabeth,  and I think she's the same way towards me. <br/>Elisabeth: I took a little siesta and I said, it ticked me  off that you would just complain to everyone else, and not say something to  Kimmi, just 'cause you're afraid you'll get a vote. I'm, like, if it's bothering you that much, I don't want to hear  it, tell Kimmi. <br/>Rodger: Mm-hmm. In the boat today, we were talking about voting against Alicia. And we would miss her, she does a good job cooking, you know...  she's athletic... and, uh... but there might be a little bit more harmony  around, too. <br/>Elisabeth: Ready? <br/>Let's go. [ thunder rumbling]  Nick: That thunder's coming in. <br/>Rodger: Don't like that. <br/>Jeff: Welcome back. I haven't really had a chance to talk to you guys since Debb was  voted out in the first Tribal Council. Haven't been back. Michael, last time you were here, Rodger sort of, kind of  confirmed that you were sort of the leader of the group. Or you had taken that position. <br/>Michael: You know, everybody has taken a leadership role  in this camp in one way, shape or form. It happened to be that food seemed to be on the top of the  charts and I was bringing in fish. And so, you know, I possibly was anointed the leader by Rodger  that day. But everybody on this team has contributed in their own way in  equal amount, and that's why we've been so strong. [ thunder rumbles, rain falls]  Jeff: Well, as always, it seems like when you guys are  here, we get the rain coming down. And there go the caps. Alicia, talk to me about leadership, because for me, looking in,  I would say you seem to be a strong leader on this tribe as well. <br/>Alicia: I don't know about that. I'm not so sure I'm a leader as much as maybe a motivator. I like to make sure that everybody is on the same page. I think if we're all on the same page, especially going into a  challenge, there's no way we're going to lose. <br/>Jeff: What's your biggest contribution? <br/>Alicia: I think my motivation for everybody is probably my  biggest contribution. I'm used to doing that back home with my job as a personal  trainer, motivating people, and I think it just comes naturally to me, in any  kind of situation, to take on that motivation role. And that's what I do, or at least I try to. <br/>Jeff: Kimmi, I've seen you in action. Where are you feeling in the tribe right now, as we come to a  vote? <br/>Kimmi: I don't know, just like with anything, it could  depend on the day or the weather, you know, what goes through your head. 'Cause, every day, you feel close to somebody and then you feel  a little bit separated, and it's, um... it's weird. <br/>Jeff: All right, guys. Behind me, four torches. Debb is the only one familiar to you guys and another one is  going to be added to that pile in a few minutes. Let's do it. Michael, you're up first. <br/>Kimmi: This really should be Alicia, but I hear other  people are voting for Jeff. <br/>Alicia: My vote is for Kimmi. are voting for Jeff. <br/>Alicia: My vote is for Kimmi. She and I have not got along from the beginning, and the whole  food thing is really becoming an issue that separates her from the rest of  the tribe, so I think it's time to let her go. <br/>Elisabeth: We need to keep our tribe strong and there's  too much split going on, so, for a strong Kucha, it's the best vote. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final. The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'm going to read them. First vote... Kimmi. Next vote... Kimmi. That's three votes: Kimmi. Four votes. No need to read the rest. Kimmi, you need to bring me your torch. <br/>Kimmi: Okay, bye, guys. <br/>Jeff: The tribe and Mother Nature have spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Kimmi: Which way? Go get 'em, guys. <br/>Jeff: Well, the good news is: you survived Tribal Council. The bad news is: this is what you get to sleep in. Have a good long walk home. Grab your torches, I'll see you tomorrow. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from next time, and hear what  Kimmi has to say. Next time on Survivor: [ man screaming] When the unthinkable  happens at Kucha, the tribe realizes survival in the outback is not just a  game. <br/>Jerri: "There has been an accident at the Kucha  camp."  Colby: Oh, my God. <br/>Elisabeth: And it just really hit hard. <br/>Kimmi: I knew for a long time that my head was on the  chopping block. It doesn't surprise me at all. I'm glad that I stayed true to myself and my morals. Um, I know that Alicia and I have not gotten along since day  one. If that's what they felt that they had to do, then, you know,  power to the team.
