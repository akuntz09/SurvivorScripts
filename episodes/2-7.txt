<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor: Three days before the merge,  Kucha had a one-member advantage over Ogakor. <br/>Nick: It's a huge advantage, because the pressure is on  them to win the next challenge. <br/>Jeff: And it looked like they might regain their winning streak  when Nick led them to victory in the reward challenge. <br/>Nick: We are a very cocky group. It's fun to have them talk about how hungry they are, and us  going there and win all their food. <br/>Jeff: Ogakor couldn't hide their frustration. <br/>Jerri: The other tribe will probably just pick us off one  by one. <br/>Jeff: But before the immunity challenge could take place,  the game took a violent twist, Michael passed out in the fire, and was  severely burned. <br/>[ Michael groaning]  Michael: Kucha, you guys know what to do. <br/>Jerri: There has been an accident at the Kucha camp, and  one of their members has been evacuated. <br/>Jeff: Michael's evacuation leaves Kucha and Ogakor even,  with five members each. Tonight, will new strategies and new friendships be born as the  two tribes merge into one? Who will be the first person voted out of the new tribe? <br/>They've been handed a gift. voted out of the new tribe? <br/>They've been handed a gift. They are going into this with an advantage, because we were  supposed to be one up on them anyway. They were about to be voted off one by one, and they know it. <br/>Jeff V.: For the last three weeks, we've been competing  with another tribe. At this point we get down to ten total people, and we come  together and merge into one tribe. <br/>Kimmi: It blows my mind to even picture any sort of  loyalty toward... I don't even know them. We have been through so much together. <br/>Jeff V.: We've talked about strategy and how we were going  to merge with this other team ever since Mike got hurt, because the last  thing that he said to us as he left was that somebody from Kucha needs to  take this money. And regardless of what happens, we need to eat 'em up and spit  'em out. <br/>Alicia: This is going to have to get ugly if we really  want this thing to work. <br/>The first vote, we have to do something to get an  advantage. <br/>Nick: It's going to depend on that first vote, and it's  smooth sailing from there. <br/>You hit it on the head, son. <br/>Elisabeth: If I had to vote right now, I'd vote Colby, and  I'd vote Jerri next. <br/>Alicia: It's got to be Jerri and Colby first. <br/>Jeff V.: My instinct says Tina was the guiding force. When I was standing in that number one circle and I was quizzing  her, and the way she was answering my questions just told me that she was  putting on a face, and was a shrewd woman. <br/>Jeff V.: We were just trying to figure out who probably is  Ogakor's weak link, and maybe we can convince them to come over and vote on  our side. <br/>Alicia: Tina will not turn on her team. <br/>Jeff V.: No, I know Tina won't turn. <br/>Alicia: There's no way. <br/>Most likely to turn is Keith. <br/>Keith and Amber. <br/>Alicia: I just think Nick and I are going to have to be  ready for anything 'cause he and I are going to be the first ones. <br/>Kimmi: See, I think they'll be gunnin' for me. <br/>Jeff V.: Listen to you all talking. It's me. Plus, Kimmi on the first reward challenge. They asked who Debb voted for, and Kimmi said Jeff, so they know  that I have a vote against me. We're anticipating a five to five tie in the first vote. And in the rules, when there's a deadlock tie, the person with  the most votes accumulated to that point is the one to leave. <br/>Nick: I had totally forgotten about that. <br/>Jeff V.: It's never left my mind. <br/>Rodger: If they remember that...  Jeff V.: But then again, that's a vote against me, so it  wouldn't leave my mind. [ laughter]  Elisabeth: What happens then? <br/>I would be, like, forget about it. <br/>Colby: Yesterday everything was canceled because of the  accident with Kucha. You know, you're just left with days that seem like there's at  least 19 to 20 hours of daylight. We have no idea what's going on, and we have no idea how drastic  or serious the situation is with Kucha. <br/>Tina: It's so unfortunate. <br/>Colby: Automatically, we assume the worst... horrible. The worst part about this is waiting around for information. <br/>Tina: It's like getting a phone call from the hospital,  saying, "Oh, we've got him here, but can't tell you what's  wrong."  Jerri: You don't think Rodger had a stroke or anything? [ Tina gasps dramatically]  Tina: Oh, my gosh. <br/>Colby: We don't know anything. We don't know when we're merging, we don't know the condition of  Kucha's member who's been in an accident. We don't know very much at all. <br/>Amber: "Boys night out."  Colby: Well? <br/>Amber: It's different. <br/>Amber: "You've wondered for weeks 'What's their camp  like?' So, here's your big chance. Send your scouts for the hike. The men will visit while the women remain. Cook a big dinner, there'll be guests to entertain." So,  we'll stay here and the guys are going to come to our camp, we'll cook dinner  for them, they're going to cook for you guys. <br/>Colby: Cool. So, we get to go on a hike. <br/>Keith: I'm all over that. <br/>Colby: Yeah! Finally get out and do something. I better iron a shirt! [ laughing] Big night out on the town, brother. <br/>Keith: Big night, you know? [ indistinct conversations] Life is good. <br/>Colby: Life is good. <br/>Keith: The merge is when the two teams come together to  make one team, and the game becomes one against one instead of team against  team. <br/>Colby: Tina, you going to catch the kids some fish  tonight? <br/>Tina: I hope. You go to one camp or the other, and I'm not sure how that  decision is going to be made at this point. <br/>Keith: We'll get a real great take on the guys in their  tribe, and where things lie. <br/>Tina: It's important for us to get information right now  about who's had votes cast against them, because it's probably going to come  down to a tie-breaker vote. <br/>Colby: We've got to be totally silent on who's had any  votes. <br/>Jerri: Yes, we do have a lot at stake. If we slip anything out regarding the voting situation, we're  done. The only thing to break the tie is past votes for the person who  is voted for. If they were to vote for myself or Keith... we'd be out. <br/>Elisabeth: Hey, fellas, are you guys ready to hear this? We got mail. "Girls' night out. You've wondered for weeks 'What's their camp like?' So here's  your big chance. Send your scouts for the hike. The women will go visit, while the fellows remain. Cook a big dinner, there'll be guests to entertain."  Jeff V.: So, you guys are going over there, and those  girls are coming over here. They're keeping the chicks apart. <br/>Elisabeth: They're going to send their chicks here? <br/>Alicia: Oh, that's sneaky. <br/>Elisabeth: That is very sneaky. <br/>Alicia: That is very sneaky. This is how it's going to start-- separate the boys and the  girls. <br/>Jeff V.: We knew that the merger was going to start today. We just weren't sure exactly how. So, we got this note, and our girls are going to them, and their  chicks are coming to us, and we're entertaining them and swooning them and  somehow convincing them that this is the place to live-- Kucha beach. <br/>Alicia: We know we don't want to go over there, so they  better really pull out all the stops. <br/>Nick: I think we have a really nice camp, and nobody  really wants to move to a new place where things are real strange. And it would kind of be our home field, our home turf advantage. <br/>Jeff V.: If we're responsible for the dinner, then those  girls are eating much better than y'all are. <br/>Alicia: Wait a minute. [ all talking]  Alicia: Wait, time out. <br/>Elisabeth: Women will go visit. <br/>Alicia: Do we have the Mountain Dew at least? <br/>MEN: No! <br/>Elisabeth: You have two cans left? <br/>Alicia: You see how fast you guys turned on us? <br/>Elisabeth: We have to bring a housewarming gift. <br/>Nick: We're not turning on you. <br/>Jeff V.: Nobody's turning on nobody. <br/>Rodger: We need our own stuff. <br/>Jeff V.: We got the majority of them over here. <br/>Nick: There's more of them to woo. We need to woo them. <br/>Elisabeth: Woo-woo-woo, "woo them"? <br/>Alicia: You know what? I don't like you guys anymore. <br/>Elisabeth: This is why they did this to us. As much as it stinks that Alicia and I aren't going to get to  join in our last chicken, we know that it's for the betterment of the whole  group to leave and go eat plain rice with Keith and Colby. He's supposedly a chef. I don't know how much he can do with white rice, and... We're  going to miss our Kucha spices. <br/>Alicia: Yeah, we had a lot of good stuff going on in our  camp. Those girls are going to be well taken care of. <br/>Elisabeth: Living large. Whoo! <br/>Alicia: Elisabeth and I felt really strange walking away  from camp, just us two. It was really kind of cool, and eventually it's going to change  this game. It's a big open book, and we got to write the rest of the pages  that go in it. <br/>Colby: I'm very curious as to how they've been living the  last 19 days. With their shelter, with their eating, you know, there's a lot  of things I want to know to see if that's where we want to be. <br/>Elisabeth: I'm excited. I'm so curious to see what their camp is like. <br/>Alicia: Well, that's the thing... And how they set it up  for us. <br/>Tina: Fe, fi, fo, fum! I smell the blood of a Kucha girl! <br/>Alicia: What's up? <br/>Elisabeth: Hey! <br/>Alicia: What's up? You know how funny it is-- the guys are expecting you guys right  now. [ laughter]  Alicia: We had... laying out the tablecloth. <br/>It said "Boys Night Out."  Alicia: They're so ready. They're going to die when they see your guys. <br/>Tina: We've been so worried. <br/>Elisabeth: They didn't even tell you guys what happened? <br/>Tina: No, not a word. <br/>Alicia: What did your note say? <br/>Amber: Somebody got hurt and they would not be returning. <br/>Tina: And they've been evacuated out. <br/>Elisabeth: Sit down for this one. <br/>Alicia: Yeah, this is a, it's a big deal. <br/>Elisabeth: It was good to hear that they were worried and  hoping everything and praying everything was okay with Mike. He apparently just hyperventilated and passed out. And all of a sudden, I see him down and he was face-first into  the fire. <br/>Alicia: His hands were burned off. When his hands were in the water, the skin was floating up above  his hand. <br/>Elisabeth: They were just red. <br/>Alicia: They put a helicopter right on our beach and took  him away. <br/>Tina: Have you heard any news on him at all? <br/>Alicia: Yeah, he's going to be okay. <br/>Tina: Glad to know it's not one of those things that's  life- threatening. I felt a lot of relief. <br/>Alicia: We were crying, we were a mess. It was really sad. <br/>Elisabeth: It was very difficult. <br/>Jerri: When we first found out yesterday that we were  merging with all five of us, after the accident over at Kucha... we didn't  really know whether to celebrate or feel bad. <br/>Alicia: Whatever takes you out of the game takes you out  of the game. Whether it's a snake bite or the fire, it was part of the game. And he is the sixth person to leave. <br/>Tina: The importance at this point in at five and five,  had a huge impact on the other four tribes, if we had gone in at six and  four, we would have been picked off one by one, no doubt about it. We're starting off the second half of the game on equal ground. It's a tie ball game, we're going into overtime. <br/>Colby: We got to be getting close. Look at this. Anybody home? <br/>Keith: Knock-knock. Hola. Jeff V.: What? Wait a minute! <br/>Colby: What are you guys doing? Well, we took a little trip down the beach. <br/>Keith: Hi, man! <br/>Nick: Good to see you. <br/>Jeff V.: So, your note said what, "Boys Night  Out"? <br/>Colby: "Boys Night Out."  Jeff V.: Ours said "Girls Night Out."  Rodger: We were expecting the women over here. <br/>Colby: Rodger, I'm real sorry, bro. I didn't even bring a skirt with me, so I can't do anything for  you, man. <br/>Colby: When Keith and I showed up, they couldn't have been  more disappointed. They were ready to wine and dine the women of Ogakor, and Keith  and I come strolling in. Look, you guys already had the table set and everything. Y'all really were expecting the... [ all talking and  laughing]  Keith: Colby and I were actually kind of hoping it was  going to be the girls cooking for the guys. We had a good time, great camaraderie, kind of like soldiers in  the field that are putting their weapons down for awhile. <br/>Colby: Well, now, you guys called this Camp Carnage, but  it looks like you guys are living pretty plush around here. Our girls, when they sent us off, they're like, "Man, check  out their camp-- if it's smelling and there's flies, I don't want to move  over there." [ laughter]  Jeff V.: All I saw from Colby were teeth-- big smile,  how's it going, whatever. He just seemed very cheery and very happy, and Keith seemed like  a little puppy tailing behind him. We saved a chicken for you. <br/>Keith: Are you serious? <br/>Rodger: Yeah, we're going to have chicken tonight. <br/>Keith: You guys are too much. <br/>Jeff V.: We got spices, too. <br/>Keith: We can roast it in paper bark. Wrap that whole thing in there, put the spices on and slow roast  that. They saved a chicken for us. They killed their last chicken and cooked it, which just was a  real gentleman thing to do for us. <br/>Jeff V.: You know, there's a Survivortwist to everything,  and they got us again. I was expecting women, you know. We were going to lather them up and go pick them flowers, and  now we're going to have to shift gears. [ laughing] They're nice, you know? They're nice guys. I knew they would be, but I get the feeling that Keith is an  outsider. So far, they're exactly what I expected. They seem to have a good relationship together, which I didn't  expect. I figured that Keith would sort of be off on his own, and he  could be, you know? They may be working us here. Just pick one up, take a bite, pass it. <br/>Colby: I didn't think I'd see chicken across these lips  for 24 days. That lemon pepper is the bomb. <br/>Jeff V.: It was good chicken, and it was good to be able  to provide them with chicken, 'cause they obviously had not been eating. <br/>Keith: Colby, what do you want me to do with this bone,  man? I don't like the way we're passing. Can we change the passing around? Can we go the other way? That was a huge thing for us. We really enjoyed that a lot. I think as the days go on, this game is going to be difficult. It is for me personally, 'cause I get caught up in the  friendship thing quite easily. <br/>Rodger: Even though it was little tough, that was still a  good chicken. <br/>Keith: Yeah. <br/>Colby: It was an excellent chicken. <br/>Rodger: I know everybody is nicey-nicey now, but I imagine  that'll change. I think it will be even more interesting once all ten of us, the  women and everybody is in the hut. There'll be some times I'm sure when things won't be so nice  around here. <br/>Elisabeth: You need some help? <br/>Jerri: I think I'll be all right. I'm just trying to cover this, 'cause you know what I just  realized? Our only matches are in Keith's pocket. <br/>Alicia: Uh-oh. <br/>Jerri: Yeah, "uh-oh" is right. So, I'm thinking we should probably cook everything because  Keith has the matches. <br/>Alicia: Are you sure he has them? <br/>Jerri: I know he does. <br/>Alicia: He's probably laughing right now, going  "Guess what? It's raining and I got the matches."  Jerri: He doesn't realize it, I'm sure. I don't want to talk about Keith in front of our guests. <br/>Alicia: Smell that. <br/>Jerri: If I voice my opinions about how I really feel  about him, they are going to figure out that votes have been placed against  him. He should not be in charge of the matches. Could have potentially now been an issue where we couldn't eat. <br/>Tina: I don't think it was a deliberate thing where he  said, "I'm going to take my matches with me so the girls won't have  it." He would not do that under any circumstances. It's in Jerri's best interest to not to show a real hateful  side. Jerri's a good chick. <br/>Jerri: Normally it looks a lots better than it is right  now. <br/>Elisabeth: We're going home. [ laughter]  Jerri: We decided that I was going to make my famous  tortilla, and we opened a can of whole peeled tomatoes. <br/>Alicia: We just want to tell you guys that your guys are  getting chicken right now. <br/>Amber: Oh! There's no way they saved any for us. <br/>Alicia: They're getting chicken right now. <br/>Amber: I'm sorry we don't have any chicken. <br/>Alicia: That's okay. <br/>Amber: This is definitely difficult for us. I mean, we wish we had so much more to offer them. It's upsetting that we can't give them as much as they can give  us. <br/>Alicia: Wow, that looks amazing, though. <br/>Jerri: Give me, like, some ingredients that I can get  creative with. <br/>Alicia: When you don't have a lot of food and you open up  a can, that's like... that's bigtime. So, we're really honored that they did that. <br/>Amber: Watch it, it's hot. <br/>Alicia: I feel like I can't wait to get them back to our  camp to give them something to eat, you know? And I never thought that I would feel that way. I really thought I would be thinking I'm not sharing anything  with them. I don't eat meat, I don't eat pork, and I'm, like, craving a hot  dog and a hamburger; I could care less right now. <br/>Jerri: I would love a hot dog. [ laughing]  Alicia: Out of 20 hours of being here, we've talked about  food 19 of those 20. So, what's your favorite kind of food? <br/>Jerri: Hot fudge. <br/>Tina: How about Dove chocolate? [ everyone groaning]  Elisabeth: We're torturing ourselves. We are absolutely torturing ourselves. <br/>Alicia: Have you ever had different flavor Tootsie Rolls,  like cherry Tootsie Rolls? <br/>Tina: Yes. <br/>Jerri: Vanilla? <br/>Alicia: They are yummy. <br/>Jerri: When did they come out with vanilla Tootsie Rolls? <br/>Amber: I asked Alicia about their firewood situation. She said they have so, so much, they don't worry about the  firewood at all. <br/>Jerri: They have a kitchen, they have all these wonderful  things. We have nothing. <br/>Amber: I agree. I'm totally for going. <br/>Jerri: I'm so stoked about going to their camp. <br/>Tina: We've got mail! <br/>Jerri: Is there chocolate in it? <br/>Tina: No, ma'am. <br/>Elisabeth: Peanut butter in that mailbox? <br/>Tina: "Once you were enemies but now you'll be one. You have just 15 minutes to get all your work done. Hike back to the croc swim. The map shows you the way. Take all that you can, but the canoe's got to stay."  Amber: Oh! Jerri: In the black bag, you guys. <br/>Tina: We're moving! <br/>Jerri: We were ready to pack up and move to camp Kucha. Roll up the flag inside. <br/>Tina: The other black glove? <br/>Amber: Do we need our fishing poles? <br/>Jerri: When we looked at the map, it was a completely  different spot. <br/>Amber: Maybe they're doing same thing, and we're going to  have a whole new camp. <br/>Elisabeth: I thought about that. Yep, I think that's what it is. <br/>Jerri: A spot that was untouched, where we would have to  build everything again from scratch. <br/>Nick: "Hike back to the croc swim. The map shows the way. Take all that you can, but the canoe's got to stay."  Jeff V.: It's a good two-hour walk. Damn it. <br/>Keith: Make sure you bring your matches. Mine are... I got my matches. Nothing's ever easy around here. <br/>Rodger: We were a little angry about it. <br/>Colby: Six minutes. <br/>Keith: I was really frustrated with it. I just didn't want to leave there. We were there, we were comfortable. <br/>Colby: I was liking that Kucha corn. <br/>Keith: Yeah, I'm liking our camp. <br/>Colby: Yeah, I was liking y'all's camp, too. <br/>Keith: It was a real pain. <br/>Rodger: Let's go. <br/>Elisabeth: I see it, I see it! <br/>Are you serious? [ women cheering and ululating]  Elisabeth: We missed you guys! <br/>Jeff V.: Hey, baby. <br/>Elisabeth: How are you? <br/>Amber: Guys, check this out! Look! Oh, my God, it's ours! [ indistinct conversations]  Rodger: They're doing all the work. I'm glad. <br/>Amber: You ready, guys? <br/>Jeff V.: I'm thinking there might be food in here. <br/>ALL: Oh! <br/>Jeff V: It looks like a little picnic. [ everybody talking]  Alicia: Okay. <br/>Amber: "Building a new home is now up to you, but  before you get started, you have two things to do. A flag must be made once your tribe's named. Here's a toast to your efforts, and the second half of the  game!" [ everybody talking and laughing ]  Alicia: One, two, three. <br/>Tina: Wow! We get to make a new flag. [ everybody squealing and cheering]  Nick: We opened the box, and and cheering]  Nick: We opened the box, and people just start diving  their hands in, which pissed me off, because I was thinking let's at least  make sure we're getting equal amounts, but Jerri and Amber and Elisabeth and  Alicia just start yapping and screaming, and I was like, I had to back up. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, cheese, cheese, cheese! <br/>Tina: I've never had wine in my life, and I'm fixin' to  have some. [ laughter] I may get drunk. <br/>Hey, guys, here's a tablecloth. <br/>This is a party! <br/>Jerri: I swear, I haven't been that excited since I was  little, and so just completely overwhelmed with the fact that you've been  starving, and the fact that you're in the middle of nowhere, and there's this  spread in front of you. <br/>ALL: Yeah! [ cheering]  Tina: It's nice starting all over, starting on equal  ground, and it was important to listen more than you talk, find out what  you're up against. <br/>Amber: Oh, you guys, this is so great! <br/>Alicia: You know, it was really kind of interesting,  because in the middle of all this celebrating, this game is still being  played, every minute of every day. <br/>Jerri: My stomach's going what is going on? <br/>Alicia: I have a little bit of shock happening right now. <br/>Jeff V.: They seem to be very nice, and I thought it was  all legitimate, and then I saw Colby and Jerri sort of sneak off and  whispering, and then I saw Colby walk over to Keith, and then they start  whispering, and they're, like, pointing at us and counting fingers, like  she's going to go first and he's going to go second, and it started. We weren't together 15 minutes, and it started. [ crickets chirping] âª  Rodger: Thank God it's not âª  Rodger: Thank God it's not raining... We need to get  something up over our heads here in case it rains tonight. <br/>Jerri: Like, what's the purpose of putting it up here? Like, the trees, the structure? <br/>Rodger: Just to have the trees and the shade and  the...  Alicia: We're gonna need a big...  Jerri: Well, you know what? I have to... I'll just express my opinion right now. <br/>Rodger: Okay. <br/>Jerri: I think...  Wow. <br/>Jerri: On the beach right there in the shade. [ indistinct chatter]  Rodger: Let's-Let's go down there and take...  Jerri: All right, let's look. Yay! [ indistinct chatter]  Colby: Sometimes you run into a situation where there's  too many chiefs and not enough Indians, so I'm just going to stand back. I don't want to ruffle any feathers at this point. <br/>Tina: You don't think that if it rains, it will rain-rain  down this thing, do you? <br/>Rodger: Uh, that...  Nick: That was one of my thoughts. <br/>Rodger: That-That was one of my thoughts, too. <br/>Tina: But we're on this high thing. <br/>Nick: Yeah. <br/>Tina: And if it runs down, it'll run down over there,  won't it? <br/>Rodger: It's called a dry creek bed. I don't know if it's always dry or not. That's the question. My idea was to originally build the, uh, hut up in the trees  where you got some good anchors, and then the girls said, they would like to  stay down on the sand 'cause it sleeps better. <br/>Is that...? <br/>Rodger: Go down with it a little bit. <br/>Rodger: Okay, go. <br/>Alicia: Hey, Jer? <br/>Jerri: Yeah. <br/>Alicia: What was that little big fish-- what was that? <br/>Jerri: All right, you know what? <br/>Elisabeth: Oh. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Alicia: That would be a perfect name. <br/>Elisabeth: What is that? <br/>Rodger: Barramundi. <br/>Alicia: Barramundi? <br/>Jeff V.: Barramundi. <br/>Ooh, I like that fish. <br/>Alicia: You... That means, like, if you catch this fish,  we'll be eating for days. <br/>Jerri: We are called the Barramundi tribe. It's a great name for our new tribe, 'cause this is when things  get slippery and sneaky, and it's hard to catch people. <br/>Elisabeth: It's the catch of the day. We're quite a catch. <br/>Keith: Good old honeymoon stage is going to end quickly. We're going to have to go into an immunity challenge, and it's  going to be obvious that we're kind of two teams living as one tribe. <br/>Jeff: Welcome! I will take the immunity idol. Barramundi, new tribe name. New tribe, new game. No longer playing for tribal immunity, playing for individual  immunity. [ all responding]  Jeff: This is what you covet. Wear this, you're immune from Tribal Council. You cannot be voted out. Today's challenge is called "The Perch." There are ten  wooden pillars to stand on, one for each of you. I'm going to warn you-- this could be a long one. This challenge tests both your will and endurance. Last one standing wins this, is immune from the vote tonight. Keep your eye on the talisman! Immunity at stake. Survivors ready... go! <br/>Jerri: Anybody want to look up at the sky and see if the  sun might peek out? <br/>Rodger: I'm-I'm afraid to look. <br/>Elisabeth: Rodger's, like, "I'm not  looking."  Rodger: I am fixed on the woods up there, son. I don't look down at the water. [ laughter] If I did, I'd be a goner. <br/>Jeff V.: I'm going to try to alphabetize the 50 states. <br/>Rodger: Well, that...  Amber: Isn't there a song? <br/>Rodger: Arkansas. <br/>Jerri: Alabama. <br/>Elisabeth: Boy, things sure have gotten fun out here. [ laughter]  Nick: You guys, have a good game. <br/>All right. <br/>Alicia: Bye, baby. <br/>Bye. <br/>Bye, Nick. <br/>Rodger: Just don't get too close to me, Nick, 'cause I'm  liable to be next. <br/>Nick: I've been sick the last couple days, and I got up  there, felt a little dizzy, knew I wasn't going to win, and jumped off, and got  a good hour of rest so, that made much more sense to me than standing up on  that block and getting tired. <br/>Colby: I'll jump in right now... Like, if it makes you  feel better. <br/>Amber: Colby, you're jumping? <br/>Colby: Yeah. <br/>Check on Nick for us. <br/>Amber: Oh, what a splash! [ applause]  And it...  I like the flip. <br/>Nick: This game's gonna go forever. <br/>Colby: It is gonna go forever. My strategy was to make the-the Kucha guys mad, to convince them  that I'm the man to vote for. If I can draw some attention away from Keith and Jerri, who both  have several votes for them, we really need one of those guys to win immunity  and the other to be camouflaged. Because if Kucha members vote for either Jerri or Keith, we're  going down. It's not even bothering some of those guys out there. It's killing me. <br/>Nick: Yeah. <br/>Jeff V.: I feel so good! <br/>Amber: Uh-oh. Jeff's bringing something out, guys. <br/>Elisabeth: Is that an ice cream cone on there? <br/>Jeff V.: No, no, that's peanut butter. <br/>Elisabeth: It's not peanut butter now. Both you guys, shut up. <br/>Jeff V.: That's peanut butter. <br/>Elisabeth: That's not. Is it Skippy? <br/>Jeff: Hey, guys. I have a little peanut butter, chocolate...  Elisabeth: Oh! Chocolate. <br/>Jeff V.: The first person off gets it? <br/>So what are you saying exactly? <br/>Jeff V.: Who gets it? <br/>Elisabeth: Colby! <br/>Jeff: That's a great idea. Colby? <br/>Colby: Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Nick, come here. <br/>ALL [ screaming]: No! <br/>That's not right. <br/>Elisabeth: This is why you keep your mouth shut. My mom says "Elisabeth, keep your mouth shut!" Do I  listen? No! <br/>Jeff: He's getting a big old dip, Elisabeth. That's pure peanut butter right there. Anybody decides to bail, you can join me. <br/>Jerri: This is torture! <br/>Rodger: I was just waiting for you to say those words. <br/>You can get a big scoop. <br/>Jeff V.: That's not enough. <br/>Jerri: No, that's not enough, Jeff. <br/>Jeff V.: That's not enough, Jeff. Forget it. <br/>Jeff: Okay. It's plenty for Rodger. <br/>Rodger: It ain't very good. Stick it out. <br/>Colby: That one bite of peanut butter was better than any  of the wine and cheese and crackers...  Jeff V.: Damn it! Shut up. <br/>Colby: Come on over to the dark side, Jeff. <br/>Amber: If you don't think you can outstand us, then I  would go, 'cause you're not gonna get that later. <br/>Jeff V.: Not if y'all are gonna vote me off, though. <br/>He's gonna be up there...  Colby: Now, see, you hear that, Jeff? <br/>Jeff V.: What? <br/>Colby: Look at these women. They're bound and determined to win this. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>God. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Colby: Oh, my God. <br/>Jerri: Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff V.: Elisabeth...  Elisabeth: Is it good? <br/>Jeff: No more takers? Okay. Four hours. See you guys in another couple. <br/>Tina: What you got there, buddy? <br/>Jeff: Here's the offer. An ice cream. I got a really hot chocolate. <br/>Amber: I just couldn't stand there. [ thunder rumbling] there. [ thunder rumbling]  Jeff V.: Maybe they feel vulnerable. Maybe those are the four people that feel the most vulnerable. I felt vulnerable, but, you know, I couldn't do it. I knew I couldn't do it. <br/>Rodger: Tina out there-- she has not had anything to eat  all day long. She-She didn't eat any breakfast this morning, and the rest of  us all had about a little bit over a half a cup of rice. And I know they're getting cold, too. <br/>Colby: These four are pretty damn determined. I've never seen anything like it. I had no idea it would last this long. There's no telling how long those four are gonna stay out there. Another fun day for Club Barramundi. <br/>Jeff: I'll tell you, this fire feels good right here. Unfortunately, not enough to heat you up. <br/>Alicia: Yeah, we know. <br/>Elisabeth: Is there any more negotiating? <br/>Jeff: Maybe. What makes you want to negotiate now, but you didn't earlier? <br/>Elisabeth: A boat ride back... could be worth it. <br/>How long you think they're going to stay out there? <br/>Jeff V.: I heard Tina say "Nothing is bringing me  down at this point." I bet Elisabeth goes next. <br/>Jeff: Stay dry, I'll get you in. <br/>Elisabeth: It's past my bedtime. <br/>Rodger: Getting off, Elisabeth! [ cheers]  Elisabeth: Good job, you guys. Go get 'em. <br/>Rodger: You okay? <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God, it feels so good. <br/>Rodger: We're all real proud of you. <br/>Jeff V.: I think they've been out there over ten hours  now. I know that Alicia is concerned she's being voted for tonight,  so I think she's going to stay. These people are crazy. You guys know we got to go to Tribal Council tonight? <br/>Hey, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Your faces say a lot. Here's what I have. Hot coffee, or hot chocolate. <br/>Alicia: And a boat ride in. <br/>Jeff: And a boat ride in. <br/>Alicia: I'll take it. I'm done. <br/>Jeff: All righty. <br/>Keith: Hey, Tina? <br/>Tina: What? <br/>Keith: I need this one. <br/>Tina: I looked over at Keith and Keith said "Tina, I  need this one." In his heart he must have really thought that he was  going to get the votes cast against him. <br/>Alicia: I'm good. I want coffee! [ indistinct conversation]  Alicia: Are you coming with me? <br/>Tina: I am. <br/>Alicia: Oh, Tina is getting down. <br/>Tina: It's the hardest thing I've ever done to come in. Much harder to come in than stay out there, because I've been  out there ten hours. I knew for our team that I needed to make that decision. So I stepped down and let him have it. <br/>Keith: Yes! <br/>Good work, Keith. <br/>Jeff: Wear that. <br/>Jeff: What a day! <br/>Alicia: What a day. <br/>Jeff: You guys just finished a marathon immunity  challenge. Come to Tribal Council, where unfortunately, you're going to  vote the first person out of your new tribe. Let's talk about today's challenge. Nick lasted 90 minutes. Now, at the other end of the spectrum, Keith lasted ten hours,  18 minutes. You get immunity. Tina, Alicia lasted 10 hours, 17 minutes, 55 seconds. Alicia, I'm thinking you obviously must not be worried, because  you were out there for a long time and finally said "Okay, I guess I've  proved my point."  Alicia: This challenge felt like it was going to go on  forever. And I don't think that my stepping off is going to change what  was going to happen tonight anyways. <br/>Jeff: Keith, when I came up to you and handed you the  talisman, I said "congratulations," and you said "Tina gave  that to me."  Keith: I really firmly believe that if she did not say,  "Okay, I'm done now," we'd all still be there, we really would. She's become like my sister, I'm telling you, and it was  definitely a gift. <br/>Jeff: What was it, Tina, that finally made you say, okay? <br/>Tina: At this point, I'm still a team player. Our team advancing does mean a lot. I know Keith needed this. So... it's all right. <br/>Jeff: Rodger, when you look at what happened today and how  many people took a bribe sooner or later and jumped off, do you think  everybody here is really worried? <br/>Rodger: Well, everybody but Keith I would say, Keith is  definitely not worried, but yes I think anyone of the other nine of us are,  has a very good possibility of being voted off. <br/>Jeff: Here's the deal. Survive tonight's vote, you are here till the bitter end. You'll be part of the jury at the very least, you may be the  final two. If you're voted out tonight, game is over. You go home, and that's it. Let's vote. Nick, you're up. <br/>Colby: It was a strategic Nick, you're up. <br/>Colby: It was a strategic move that was determined the  first week we were here. <br/>Rodger: I really like the guy, but he's from the Ogakor  tribe and they have all got to go. <br/>Tina: He seemed like a really great guy, this is 100% a  strategic vote. <br/>Jeff V.: 'Cause everything is bigger and better in  Texas... this lone star has got to go. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Jeff: Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final. The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. First vote, Colby. Colby. Jeff. Jeff. Two votes each Jeff and Colby. Jeff. Colby. Jeff. Colby. I'll read the last two. One for Jeff, that's five. Look at that, one for Colby. We have a tie. Okay. In the case of a tie, here's how it works. Jeff, Colby, you will not vote. The other eight of you will vote. And as is customary, I'm going to give you guys a chance to  plead your case, although I don't know who you're pleading to, this is  obviously two tribes voting completely down tribal lines. Jeff, we'll start with you. <br/>Jeff V.: There's nothing that I can say, I don't think, to  change anybody's mind. If I go home tonight I will walk out of here with a smile on my  face, and be very proud of every moment that I had here. <br/>Jeff: Colby? <br/>Colby: I only know how to play the game one way and that's  full tilt, and if that makes me a threat then so be it. But I'm here for one reason and that's to win, and this is the  only way I know how. <br/>Jeff: What we're going to do is, we're going to vote again. Nick, you're up first, if you would, please. Thanks. <br/>Jeff: Same rules apply, as with any vote once they're  tallied the decision is final. Jeff. Colby. Jeff. Colby. Jeff. Colby. Jeff. Colby. So it's very clear, old tribal lines run very deep in this  group. I think we could be here until the sun comes up and nobody here  is going to change their vote. So we're ruling this a deadlocked vote. Now what happens, the rules state we go to votes cast in  previous Tribal Councils. Whoever has more votes, Jeff or Colby, will be voted out. Colby, how many votes have you had cast against you? <br/>Zero. <br/>Jeff: Zero. Jeff? <br/>Jeff V.: One that I know of. <br/>Jeff: Enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Jeff: Jeff, the tribe has You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Jeff: Jeff, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. I could be wrong, but I have a feeling over the next few days  new friendships are going to emerge, new voting patterns will form. You guys have had a long day. You can grab your torches and head back to camp. I'll see you tomorrow. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes I'll see you tomorrow. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode and hear  what Jeff has to say. Next time on Survivor: Will tribal loyalties begin to crumble  when Elisabeth discovers a crack in Ogakor's alliance? <br/>Elisabeth: That makes me sick. I'm not going to sit here being sick. I think there's a crack in their tribe right now. If you want to stay here, if you want to keep playing this game,  you better get a little more ruthless sometimes. <br/>Jeff V.: I knew this was going to happen because of a very  large mouth of a former tribe member at Kucha, Ogakor knew I had that vote,  and I knew there was nothing I could do about it. So I'm going home and I've had an awesome time. This has just been the most amazing experience I've ever had in  my entire life.
