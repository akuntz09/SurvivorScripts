<br/>Probst: Previously on Survivor:The tribe's spirits were lifted when they got to see their loved ones at the reward challenge. <br/>Way to go, girl! <br/>Probst: Kathy's son won, and spent the night at Soliantu. <br/>Coming out here, it's just like, wow. It's a whole other world. <br/>Probst: But focus soon turned back to the game. <br/>I'll tell you, Paschal is our strongest adversary. <br/>Probst: Where old bonds were as strong as ever. <br/>It's now Rob's turn to get chopped, but Paschal and Neleh, that unit needs to be severed. <br/>Probst: Vecepia won the immunity challenge. <br/>Yeah, baby! Oh, give it to me! <br/>Probst: And at Tribal Council, Rob was voted out. General, the tribe has spoken. Five are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, yeah, now that's a fire. <br/>Guys. <br/>What? <br/>He's hungry. <br/>Oh, we're going to go get some apples. <br/>I want some real food, man. <br/>I know. <br/>This sucks, man, these days, they're not going as fast as you think. At this point, people just want to eat, get through another day, count them down, win some immunities and then see where the cards lay. The next few days, depending on the immunities with five people, I can give you ten different combinations of what could happen, and I'm not going to sit here and do that because that takes too much energy to strategize. At this point, like I told V, just one day at a time. I'm just tired of strategizing and even thinking, but I'm going to go out fighting. <br/>The perception was always that Kathy was being cool because people were continuously linking Sean and I, and then linking Paschal and Neleh. And so... and then obviously, Kathy being the fifth person saying, "Well, who's going to get her to sway their way?" But I truly do not believe race is an issue on this beach. With the subsequent swing vote, they're going to look at these two African Americans, regardless of what we talk about, they're going to say "Okay, those two are in together, you know, they may vote the same, or whatever. The two African-Americans, these two are close and you're right in the middle." They made mention that I am definitely a swing vote. It's going to look big, playing the race card of it. I actually hadn't thought about that until V said that. <br/>Then, to be on that side, with Pap and Neleh, and hearing them saying, you know, "We're not going to vote for one another." To come out here and be stuck on an island with five people who are talking and backstabbing, that's really tough. V took Kathy aside and had her little discussion with her, and you know the whole race thing just is... is just ridiculous. It's never ever played a part in this game. Every once in a while they'll just throw in something like, "It's us two African Americans against you two, and then Kathy is a swing vote." That made me really irritated. It's almost like a guilt thing, you know. <br/>It's like you owe them something. <br/>I know. <br/>That just gives me more resolve. I bet Kathy feels like an absolute fool to even be asked to consider something like that. If V is coming to Kathy and suggesting to Kathy that this is a race thing, right here at the end, I think V is really foolish to believe that Kathy is going to allow herself to be put in that spot. I mean, that's just sickening. <br/>Just Sean's attitude seriously is just like dragging me down. He just complains like all the time. <br/>There's absolutely no reason from day one to believe either one of them, never. <br/>I would absolutely be puking sick if you and V and Sean are at the end. I would just throw up. <br/>I don't want to be cast like the swing player that made the wrong swing move. Every minute I'm trying to figure out this game and the best way to play it. I'm still looking out for myself. <br/>Oh, no! We have to do stilts again. <br/>Shoot. <br/>"Balance, aim and cunning, You've done it all before. Capitalize on past mistakes, come for a weight behind the door." Well, we got tree mail that was written on a pair of stilts, and it basically said that we had done whatever we're going to do before, whatever that means. It might not have anything to do with stilts. <br/>Oh, yes, it does. <br/>Well, if it does, I'm out. I can never figure them out, so I'll just wait and see. When Jeff tells us, that's when I'll know. <br/>Probst: All right, guys. You've been out here 34 days, covered a lot of ground, experienced a lot of things, hopefully with very few regrets. But I know there's one or two challenges you wouldn't mind getting another shot at. Today's reward challenge combines elements of six previous challenges. You'll begin by assembling a tiki. You each will have a color-coded tiki that's been chopped into eight pieces. The pieces have been spread out into the jungle. Find all eight pieces, bring it back, assemble it correctly. Move to the next stage. You'll find a pile of coconuts and a bamboo chute. Break coconuts until your bamboo chute is overflowing with coconut juice. Continue through the jungle. You'll find stilts hanging in the air tied to a log. Undo the knots, releasing the stilts. Take the stilts with you to the fourth stage: The stilt-walking portion of the challenge. It's a ten-foot section. You must complete it before you can move on. Once you're done with the stilts, you'll come to another pile of coconuts. Inside one of these coconuts is a key. Use that key to unlock the box, you will find a slingshot. That brings you to the final stage of the competition. Take your slingshot and your colored rocks and break the tile over your tiki. First person to fracture their own tile and get sand on their own tiki wins reward. I know how tiring 34 days is. I hope you find the reward worthy of a very long challenge. Bring it down, guys. It's a Saturn Vue, all-wheel drive SUV. Fully loaded, got all the extras. For you to enjoy when you return home. All right, guys. Take your spots. Let's go. Here we go. Survivors ready?! Go! V's getting it. Go! V's getting it. There you go, Neleh. You're still in this. V's almost there. Sean and Neleh, tikis are taking shape. That's it, V. You're moving on. Neleh, you just about have it. You're moving on. Neleh, you just about have it. Sean, you're getting closer, too. Neleh, you got it. You can move on. <br/>I don't have it, right? <br/>Probst: Not quite, Kathy. Keep trying. Sean, that's it. You can move on. Way to go Kathy. You got it. Move on. <br/>Good going, Kathy. <br/>Probst: You're still in this, Kathy. V's got about half. Neleh, you got about half. Sean's got about two thirds. Kathy working for her first. This might do it for Sean. Closer. A little more. That's it. You're done. Get the last knot. Heads up, stilts coming down. Nobody close. Let's see if you can do what you couldn't do a few weeks ago: walk on stilts. Cross this line and you're good. Look at that! You're good! Find the key. It's as good as yours. Nobody close. <br/>Yes! God is so good! I can do all things through Christ, baby. I can do all things through Christ! Jesus Christ! <br/>Probst: Nobody even close. You know what? You may not look good, but you're going to look good in that ride. Nice work. <br/>Give me some love, brother. You got the reward! <br/>Go, Sean! <br/>It's beautiful. It's automatic, too. Wow. <br/>Yeah, you look great! <br/>Is that the temperature? <br/>Temperature outside. [honking horn] Fantastic, Sean. [honking horn] Fantastic, Sean. That was so great. <br/>Boy, your students are going to be proud of you. <br/>I can't believe it. I just can't believe it. The car is great. It's a new car with no car payments. I'm blessed, man. I can't ask for anything better. I mean, the car is, you know, it's beautiful. First of all, it was winning and overcoming the feeling of being fatigued and tired. <br/>I'm proud of you, brother. Came up in here running things. <br/>All those kids in the inner city, for everybody who feels like they can look at me and feel represented, this was for them. It's funny when you play this game, you don't realize that you get emotionally attached to folks. Before you know it, you're like, "damn." I'll tell you something else you don't realize when you set off, and that's at my age... how difficult it is for somebody my age. Physically, I'm a wreck. I felt like I was quite capable of dealing with anything that was thrown my way, but the last two or three days have been a real struggle for all of us. You know, we don't get any protein. We're not getting much carbohydrates. We're not getting much of anything. Our bodies have just been taking a pounding and it's really beginning to take an effect on me. I need to go up to the waterfall and get some water. I may wait and do it in the morning. I can barely get up. When I get up, I have to stand up next to a tree and close my eyes because I'm so dizzy. <br/>We're not really all in our right frame of mind right now, you know, we're like holding on, literally. After almost five or six weeks of having diarrhea, having to dig holes to take a crap, after doing challenge after challenge and dealing with mental games and people lying to you and sleeping in dirt. You get to a point where you don't know which way is up. But I think Pappy-- he's more lethargic and tired than anybody. <br/>Every time when I get up, I get so, so dizzy. <br/>Same here. <br/>I sit up against a tree for a second. <br/>What's that from? Is that dehydration? Let's drink some water. <br/>I don't know. I've been drinking lots of water and all day yesterday I was in a complete fog. I mean, I couldn't see things clearly. <br/>Same here. Not only am I depleted physically, but I'm depleted mentally, and that's why Paschal right now is cashing out. He's just hibernating. He's not going to do any major twists and turns because it's just too much. <br/>We have to go out and get troca. Just in the next hour, the tide is the lowest, it's the easiest to get them. <br/>I'll go with you. <br/>I just need some help. <br/>Everybody, if everybody goes and just gets four or five, we'll be okay. It's much quicker. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Finding troca is more than just troca. It is beautiful to get away from this beach and in that serene South Pacific waters. It's warm. It's like a bathtub. But I'm trying to bring people out there to teach them; to go out there are get that troca. Because I don't want to be the sole provider and work and work and work. It's tiring. <br/>My first troca. <br/>All right, man! I'm telling you, it's like an Easter egg hunt. Sean's out here with his first troca discovery. It's taken a lot to get him out here, I'm a little disappointed, but he's a city kid. So, I'm glad I finally got him out here. <br/>I caught my first troca today. You know, they hang onto the rocks. They like suction. You just got to pull them off, but the only thing is the rocks are slippery as you're walking, and you know, I'm not a ocean guy and there's black-tipped sharks out here and all kinds of sea urchins. So you got to be careful. So, I got about five or ten. You know, that's pretty good for a brother from uptown, you know. <br/>Today I just noticed that Paschal was a little down throughout the day, and he said that he felt that people were thinking that him and Neleh have some type of agreement, you know, outside of the five of us making an agreement. So I said I think it's best to clear the air. I don't want you looming with some concerns that we're trying to do something, coming together that... to get you guys. <br/>My attitude is: May the best man win. Out of this five, whoever wins is very deserving. I've got no problems with that. <br/>Why don't we address that tonight again? I mean, I don't know if anyone needs reassuring, but maybe some people do. <br/>That would be nice just to say, you know, say how we feel. <br/>Tonight, at some point, we'll all sit down. We'll allow Paschal to clear the air. It's best to try to get as much of it out in the open as we can than to sit here and have it linger. I'd hate for all of us go to bed still feeling uncomfortable. Let's just go ahead and open up still feeling uncomfortable. Let's just go ahead and open up this conversation. I know Pappy, I saw you earlier today, and you had been looking pretty down all day, and I finally took the opportunity to ask you, you know, what was wrong. And you addressed some concerns. And since we're all here, you can just go ahead and address it. <br/>Well, my concern was that I felt like that you and Sean thought that Neleh and I had entered some type of pact to vote solid on everything. And I've said from day one that I wouldn't vote against Neleh and that's my word, if it costs me in the end, so be it, but that's my word. <br/>I didn't know that. I know you guy had a bond and a friendship, but I honestly didn't know you were not going to vote each other out. We're talking numbers, okay? We're at five. All right. But you guys are really one. <br/>I'm not trying to justify anything. I mean, if you all want to do something based on the fact that we're honest with you, go for it. <br/>And the thing is, too, is that I feel that Sean and V have a very, very tight bond. And I think if it came down to it, they're going to stick together. You know, they've been together until the end. They've got a really tight bond, and maybe that's just something that's like not coming out or something, you know. Like I have no idea. <br/>I respect that. <br/>I'm just saying... Don't use me and V as a scapegoat. You came out of your mouth and said, "I'm not voting for Pap. Pappy is not voting for me." Don't assume that V and I... I'm just saying... But you're assuming if there's something underneath. We're all being truthful. I already told you V and I had our differences and we still have our differences. So don't sit there and say, "I think people are not saying stuff" because that's an insult. <br/>I'm just saying... I'm reading between the lines. <br/>Sean. It's very clear that Sean and V are very, very tight together, whether they want to call it alliance. I think the only difference is that Paschal and I have been honest about saying, up front, you know, we formed a great relationship. Sean and V are kind of skipping around the table saying, "Yeah, we have a strong relationship, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they won't vote each other out." From day one myself and V never had a pact. Although some people thought "Okay, there's the black couple. They're definitely..." You know, we haven't walked around saying, "We're the two African Americans. We're sticking together." By no means is there a V and Sean connection that's going to download or whatever. I felt like the conversation was sidetracked when Neleh tried to interject that there's something going on with V and myself, and I had to tell her just because V and I are African Americans, we share a bond that you won't really be able to understand. Does that mean we're an automatic alliance? No. Because a few times V has slipped the script on me and let me down. <br/>The most important thing out of all this is honesty and integrity. <br/>I agree. <br/>I think the bottom line is there's a little alliance. You know, there's a small one: you guys made a pact. I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm just saying it throws askew in how we progress. That's all. âª It all depends on Kathy because I know V and Sean will vote for me-- 100% positive. <br/>I'm not worried about it. <br/>Oh, I'm not worried about it. You know, last night was pretty intense at the fire. Everybody had a lot to say. Things got pretty hyped, and I'm definitely feeling vulnerable. I just hope Kathy, you know, doesn't fall for what Sean and V are kind of playing out on the table. <br/>I'm totally confused. <br/>You shouldn't be confused. This thing is so plain to me, it's sickening. <br/>Well, then fill me in, will you. <br/>I will, as best I can. I mean, this is my perspective. I wouldn't ask you to change a thing that's in your heart, but this is just something that just hit me like a ton of bricks last night. Geez, these guys are, have planned from day one. On the other side, I mean, both sides have said the same thing, and we've been duped by V and Sean. They've duped everybody else on the other side and they've duped people on this side. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Both Vecepia and Sean, they've been just basically skating for 33 days, and not really contributing their part until right here at the end. We got that from the people they were with at the other camp, plus we were told the same thing when we got back here about the other members of the tribe that was here. Plus, the conversation that we had last night around the fire really got heated, and Sean, you know, he got quite emotional, quite loud, and that just turned us all off. It's not my desire to change your opinion. It's just my desire to say what I think is going on and what's been going on. <br/>I just don't see that. Damn. <br/>Well, believe me. It's cultural. <br/>It's what? I'm so naive. <br/>It runs deep. <br/>I know it does. <br/>V and Sean, they're trying to make Kathy feel like she's a swing vote. I mean, they've got an agenda, and I don't give a damn about their agenda. I'm just kind of fed up about hearing their crap about, you know, them not being an alliance. And if you think for one second if it came down to Sean, V, and you... I'm out of here. <br/>Kathy, you know, she's from Vermont. I'm from Georgia. And Sean's from Harlem. This thing runs deeper than a game. I'm not willing to capitulate, and, you know, I'm going to dig in-- to heck with them. If they're lying and deceiving me, then first opportunity I get to vote one of them off, they're out of here. <br/>Come on! Come on. Come on! Get it up there. Come on! Come on. Come on! Come on! Get it up there! Tensions are way too high. Paschal thinks that Sean and V are definitely up to something from day one. So I thought I'd fly my kite. And it's too gusty. It's not consistent wind. I think if I go to the final three with Paschal and Neleh, I will invariably get voted out. So I've been trying to figure out how I can get to the final two, and I think Sean or V is an answer. And when we do get to the three, the three of us, we just... we have to be fair. <br/>Definitely. Because I'm the odd one out, man, I'm the white girl. <br/>Don't say that. <br/>I'm the white mama. <br/>You know, V and I have had... she's switched a few times on me... I know. <br/>...and people think that our loyalty is brother and sister. <br/>When she does, she moves around a little. <br/>Just remember that. So, I'll play fair. <br/>Yep. <br/>I think what Kathy is feeling is what we're saying. She didn't really like the fact that Pappy and Neleh had that so-called alliance. So maybe we're leaning towards getting rid of Neleh and Pap. <br/>I think both of them won't be big adversaries. I really don't. It's a wide-open game, no doubt about it, and I think the immunity challenges are going to really swing it. Because they're not physical, anybody can win. <br/>Probst: First things first, anybody can win. <br/>Probst: First things first, V. I'll take back the immunity necklace. Immunity back up for grabs. Have a seat. All right. Your success in tonight's immunity challenge will be based on your ability to answer a series of questions from a story I'm about to tell you. Here's how it will work: There are six stations, spread out around the area. Each station has a question and two possible answers. Only one person is allowed in a station at a time. So when you reach a station, take your torch, put it in the slot. That means it is occupied and nobody can join you. If you answer correctly, you'll reach in and you'll pull out a tiki. Attach that to a necklace around your neck and move on. If you answer incorrectly, you'll get a bone, and you must go to the firewalk and offer your bone as a sacrifice before you can continue. So a wrong answer will cost you valuable time running to the walk. First person to get five out of six correctly and cross the finish line with five tikis wins immunity. This is a very important and beautiful place for the Marquesan people, but as beautiful as this place is, it is steeped in a history of violence. This area, in particular, was home to a legendary warrior, Keikahanui. He was the chief of his tribe, and he was feared among all other warriors. His body was covered in intricate Marquesan tattoos. Now, the tattooing process itself was very crude. Tattoo comes were usually made from human bone, sometimes pearl, and even occasionally animal bone. The comb was pounded into the flesh using a mallet made of iron wood. Very painful, took years. Keikahanui was feared in battle because he always seemed to know what his enemy was going to do, and he did this by infiltrating the tribes of his rivals and posing as an ordinary tribesman. Well, he was living with a rival tribe when he learned they planned to make war on his own tribe. He didn't want to battle his own people, so he decided to fake an injury. He went down to the sea and he grabbed two sea urchins. He took the guts and he wrapped them around his foot with a tapa, trying to fake an injury. The smell was so bad the trick worked. The rest of the rival tribe thought he was incapacitated. They went off to do war. As soon as they were out of sight, he stripped off the two urchins, disguised himself by taking his long hair and pulling it up into two buns and then he grabbed his favorite weapon of choice, the war club, made of iron wood, designed to kill with a blow to the head. He knew a shortcut, took off running. His plan was to ambush the war party, kill the chief, and then the tribe would feast on the chief. This cannibalism was a very common part of Marquesan life. It was believed that if you ate the meat of another warrior, you inherited their power. So the fleshiest part of the meat was reserved for the warrior who made the kill, and Marquesan chiefs would preside over this ceremony. And a mana stone would be placed at the top of the victim's skull to capture their spirit. Keikahanui's plan worked perfectly. Victory for Keikahanui. He feasted on the dead chief and then he let his hair down and revealed his true identity to the defeated tribe. So with the power of the vanquished chief now in Keikahanui, legend has it, he unified the tribes. That ceremony took place on this very spot. I'll give you your necklace, grab a torch, and let's do this. This is for immunity and a guaranteed spot in the final four. Survivors ready?! Go! <br/>The warrior who made the Go! <br/>The warrior who made the kill. <br/>The war club was made from wood. <br/>"A mana stone was used to crush the skull of the dead... capture the spirit of a dead warrior..." Crush the skull of the dead. <br/>"Keikahanui disguised himself by..." &gt; Wrapping his feet with two sea urchins. <br/>Probst: V and Sean have one wrong, got to put the bone in the wok. <br/>False. <br/>Warriors... Wood. Yes. <br/>"Warriors most lethal weapon in battle was..." Probst: If you miss it, take your bone to the wok. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Probst: Neleh and Kathy each have four. It's very close. <br/>Okay, "disguised himself for battle by: gathering his hair in two buns... ...wrapping his feet with two sea urchins." Disguised himself for battle by gathering his hair into two buns. Okay, gathering his hair into two buns. <br/>False. <br/>Probst: Let's see the tikis. <br/>False. <br/>Probst: Let's see the tikis. <br/>It's fine, right? <br/>One fell off. <br/>Probst: You've only got four. You lost a tiki. You must have lost one, too. The game is still alive, guys! Make sure you hang onto your tikis. You got to go to a new question if you can't find it. You can't go to the same question. <br/>Probst: Kathy has five tikis! <br/>Woo! All right! It's so fun to win this game! All right, yes. <br/>Probst: Turn around here. Add this to your necklace. <br/>Thanks, you guys. <br/>Probst: At this point in the game, I don't think immunity can get any more valuable. <br/>Oh, that's for sure. âª I am the core fifth player. âª I am the core fifth player. I got two people on either side of me. Paschal and Neleh are on one side. Paschal and Neleh and I have been together from the get-go. Paschal and Neleh have already told themselves many moons ago that they'll never vote against each other, so that's a dilemma for me. But my other two people, Sean and V, are also original tribe members from the get-go. They're telling me they don't have a strong bond, and yet they're both Afro-American and I know that's very important in their culture to stick together. So I got Sean and V, and I got Paschal and Neleh. I got all these different issues weighing back and forth, and I have to make a decision which way to go. âª Probst: We'll now bring in the jury. John, Zoe, Tammy, and the General, who was voted out last week. Tonight one of you five will be voted out. You'll become part of the jury, the jury who will ultimately cast the final votes to decide who isthe ultimate Survivor. So Kathy, you got to be sitting back there thinking, "Wow," because obviously right now, four people vying for your vote. You are clearly the swing vote. You're the one that everybody is directing their request to. So where are you sitting right now in terms of that? <br/>I mean, the layers of it, it's ridiculous. The strategy of it is number one, because I would be paired up with Paschal and Neleh or Sean and V. And to just dissect how I'm going to fall within those two pairs is very difficult. <br/>Probst: So, the irony is that tonight we have five people, really only one of whom doesn't need immunity-- you. You're not in any danger and you're wearing this very valuable thing. Have you thought about utilizing the value of the immunity necklace in another way? <br/>I always think that this is up for negotiating if somebody wants to come to me. I have to say, nobody has come to me. <br/>Probst: Are you surprised by that? <br/>Very. If it's a game and people are playing and they want to win, nobody has come to talk to me. <br/>Probst: Anybody here want to approach Kathy? <br/>Me. <br/>Probst: What's the deal you're offering Kathy? <br/>You give me immunity, I don't vote for you, and we go to the top. <br/>Probst: You have two. So why is that a good thing for Kathy? You're still outnumbered. <br/>I don't want to put all my strategy out there. I mean, there's some things that are obvious, but I'm telling Kathy, you won't have my vote against you, and you can read between the lines all you want with that. It's tough, Jeff, because... You haven't explained it to me, though. You haven't explained to me... You haven't explained... come to me prior to this, and so I don't understand where your head's at. <br/>My thinking was this: Because these two had an alliance, I thought that maybe Kat would want to hook up with me-- this is funny, us getting into this-- would want to hook up with me and V. The thing is me and V never had that kind of agreement where you had to feel apprehensive about coming in and saying, "Here's two African Americans. Are they going to now band together and oust me out?" If they're going to have a pact, then we need to have a pact and then go and say, "May the best man truly win." Everybody is quiet. So I can say what I know what I can do. <br/>Let me go ahead and just jump in here real quick. I understand what you're saying, Sean, and if this was to happen, if Kathy was to agree to give him the immunity, I would fall in line with that and work as a threesome and have a threesome agreement. <br/>Let me just say one thing here. A lot has been said that by Sean, who is quite capable of explaining very well his position, but in some fashion I find it quite amusing and contradictory. Here he's said all night there's no association between him and V, and yet when Kathy pressed about what his game plan was, why he was willing to present her to get her to the top, it wasn't, "Well, let me talk to V." It was, "Well, you can get with me and V, and then we'll have the numbers." That tells me a lot of what Sean's been doing and thinking, and I think he's disingenuous. <br/>Jeff, I just wanted to, because it was a remark made to me. I want to defend my character. First of all, I don't think it was disingenuous. What I think is five minute ago, I stick to my word. V and I didn't have an agreement, so what I put out there was V could have been Tammy or anybody. What I put out there was a life raft to say, "Yo, hang on," and I put it out there. Me and V didn't have no agreement. We've been the underdog, and it's not like we've had an agreement. Like when you're playing cards and Monopoly and you make a last-ditch. It's not disingenuous. I've never broken my word. I stick to that to this point. I threw something out there. Either she's going to say yes or no. If she says no, then by all means, my card has folded, then vote me out. Let me go. If she says yes, let's roll the dice. <br/>Probst: So let me just recap. So Sean and V are saying, "Give one of us immunity, side with us; we'll go with you." Paschal and Neleh are saying, "Side with us. We'll go with you." So that's where it stands. Anybody want to add anything? <br/>Why didn't she know about their pact a long time ago? <br/>I assumedit was there. <br/>I know you assumed, but you know... See, I thought she knew until that night at the fire. <br/>Nothing was confirmed. <br/>Wait a second. Wait a second. We never hid it from anybody. So don't talk about assumptions. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm not saying you hid it, but being so close, why wouldn't she know? <br/>Yeah, but I don't care. <br/>She knows now. Well, point the finger at me. The point is you didn't know two weeks ago. <br/>Well, I'll point it at you. <br/>All right, point it at me. <br/>The point is, she knows now. She knew today. She knows everything. <br/>No, no, no. <br/>If you'd just listen once in a while instead of running your mouth all the time. <br/>I'm listening! I'm listening! What are you saying? <br/>I'm saying that she knew about it and we talked about the negotiations. <br/>Please, please. She did not know. She just told me. <br/>Look, this is the deal. <br/>They ain't going to shush me up. Vote me out, but I'm going to speak my mind. She did not know. Now, they can play this hankypanky with everybody and do it because I'm always speaking out. Vote me out if that's your conscience. But you all deal with the BS. She did not know. You're putting words in my mouth right now. All right? <br/>But you didn't know about their pact though is all I'm saying. <br/>I didn't hear officially, but it's a logical assumption because they've known each other for so long. <br/>Come on, man. I know I'm young and I might talk a whole lot, but some of the stuff I make sense. Damn, I do listen. I still got respect for you. But damn it, I'm a man, too, and all I'm saying is none of this jives up, because if these two has a pact, that means they're doing the same thing they're accusing me and V of doing. I'm disingenuous when I do it... Just let it go. <br/>Okay. <br/>Let it go. <br/>Probst: All right. So, here's where we're at. Kathy, very powerful situation. V and Sean obviously want your vote. Paschal and Neleh obviously want your vote. It's all going to come down to what decision you make when you walk from here to there. It is time to vote. Sean, you're first. <br/>The girl-next-door act don't Sean, you're first. <br/>The girl-next-door act don't work on me. You're just here for the ride. Y'all trying to win a million just like me, and I hope you go out tonight. <br/>Sean, this vote is for you. Just too much drama. I just can't stand it. <br/>A great competitor. <br/>My vote tonight is for Neleh. <br/>A great competitor. <br/>My vote tonight is for Neleh. She's a great girl, but I think she started a little late in trying to play the game, and, um, that's about it. <br/>Probst: Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Neleh. Sean. Neleh. Sean. Two votes Neleh; two votes Sean. Final vote. Sean. <br/>D'oh! <br/>Probst: You need to bring me your torch. Sean, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Well, I don't know if you noticed tonight or not, but the jury is all dressed the same, wearing black. I don't know if it means anything or not. I do know this: the only thing that guarantees you a spot in the final two is winning two more immunities, and that begins tomorrow. You guys can head back to camp. <br/>It's a lot one can say, but I just know that through it all, it's been a blast. Y'all, forgive me for any mistakes that I made. I'm just a humble, young man trying to find my way through this world. I just say keep your head up. God bless America. Peace.
