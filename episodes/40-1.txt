<br/>Go! You better be ready <br/>Jeff: It's going to be a big battle. This is like the old  days. 20 winners. Everybody wants it. It's not going to be easy. You are  witnessing 16 americans begin an adventure that will forever change their  lives. For the next 39 days, they'll be marooned, left to fend for  themselves. They must learn to adapt or they're voted off. In the end, only  one will remain and will leave the island with $1 million in cash as their  reward. <br/>I have a big reputation  in "Survivor," but seeing my competitors, I’m like, oh, man. <br/>fans in super bowl wait all year to see the game at the  end. Fans of "Survivor" have been waiting 20 years to see "Winners  at War." <br/>I haven't had an  opportunity to be my die poll cal self at all in the past couple years. I  have been busy bidding a family, but I’m like a phoenix rising from the ashes  ready to burn down your house. <br/>I was diagnosed with  hodgkin's lymphoma. I remember dreaming and praying that i'd be alive long  enough to play "Survivor" again. And so it is a miracle that I’m sitting  here today. <br/>I was a kid the first  time I played the game. Little did I know I was going the fall in love, meet  my husband, get engaged at the finale, win the show. But now to be asked back  for season 40 all winners? I want to win the game. To come out here and win  two times and beat my husband again, that would be awesome. <br/>Jeff: It's the biggest battle in "Survivor"  history. <br/>everybody is going to be laying it all on the line. <br/>Jeff: Who will have what it takes to outwit, outplay, and  outlast all the rest? <br/>it's going to be a bloodbath. <br/>it's going to be a war. <br/>Jeff: And be crowned the greatest player of all time? <br/>let the fireworks begin. <br/>Jeff: 39 days, 20 people, one Survivor. <br/>here we go, boys. <br/>there he is. <br/>wow. <br/>we're back. <br/>Jeff: We have the men. Here come the women. <br/>oh, my God. <br/>here they come. Here they come. <br/>this is really happening. <br/>oh, man. <br/>you good? <br/>Jeff: Your first look at who you are playing against as  they get their first look at who they are playing against. <br/>welcome. <br/>Jeff: Wow. [applause] <br/>welcome, ladies. <br/>how you doing? You guys hit the ocean yet? <br/>the queen. <br/>I’m shocked to see Rob and  Amber. I spent 36 days with boston Robb on island of the idol, and boston Rob  never told me that he was politician again. <br/>got you wife here, huh? <br/>so I definitely feel betrayed. <br/>good job. <br/>Jeff: All right. Wow. Let me take this in. 20 winners, 20  years in the making. This is awesome. Wendell, you applied many times to get  on this show, and then you fulfilled the dream of every player. You actually  won. What's the feeling? <br/>it's got to be the greatest feeling in your life. I'm  amongst the greats right now. I see some legends. A lot of legends. 19  legends out here. It feels good, man. It's the best feeling. <br/>Jeff: Yul, you played 14 years ago. <br/>yep. <br/>Jeff: The iphone didn't even exist. [laughter] do you see  this game today through a different prism as a more mature human? <br/>yeah. I feel like a dinosaur that's been time bombed into  the future. The world has changed. The people have changed. "Survivor"  has changed. I think I’m going to have to change. <br/>Jeff: Amber. <br/>Jeff. <br/>Jeff: You first played 20 years ago. Little perspective.  Not only had the iphone not beenen vetted, itunes didn't exist, twitter,  facebook. You were this young woman who came on the show. You end up meeting  Rob. You get engaged on the show, and now you've created a family with four  beautiful children. What does this mean for you this time as a very different  woman than you were the first time? <br/>it's honestly kind of like a nice vacation. I don't have  to worry about what's for dinner. I'm not cooking it. I'm not going grocery  shopping. This is awesome, but to be honest, to be a part of season 40, it's  going to be the biggest, most epic season yet. How could you pass up this  opportunity? <br/>Jeff: All right. Before we get to it, let's have a little  toast to celebrate. <br/>Jeff: Come on now. <br/>whoa. <br/>yeah. [applause] <br/>are we playing "Survivor"? <br/>Jeff: This is a once-in-a-tv-series moment. We got to  celebrate it. [applause] <br/>do it up. [cheering and applause] <br/>my competition here is the greatest of the great, and it's  a good feeling, because we're all here to be part of something special. <br/>thank you, sir. <br/>but everyone will be guns a-blazein', everyone will be  swords a-swinging. There will be limbs and heads flying everywhere. <br/>Jeff: I just want to say, we are proud to have you here as  representatives of our 40th you have earned it, but this is still "Survivor."  and even though you have all won, there will be tough times. You will be  challenged. You will be vulnerable. When those moments happen, just remember,  you belong. To "Survivor," because a drink before war is always a  good idea. [cheering] <br/>cheers, girls. <br/>cheers. <br/>get rid of that. <br/>Jeff: All right. "Survivor" 40, "Winners at  War." you are divided into men and women, and this is not how we are  going to play. <br/>oh, wow. <br/>Jeff: Let's reveal our tribes. Find your name and take it. <br/>thanks, sir. <br/>even though I’m the most recent female winner out here,  it's pretty nerve-racking, because I have nine of the most intimidating women  right next to me. I mean, "Winners at War"? It just sounds nasty. <br/>Jeff: Everybody open your buff. Let's see what's up. <br/>blue, blue. <br/>blue. <br/>Jeff: Take your spots. Blue is over here. Blue is over  here, Jeremy. Rob, blue is over here. Amber, red is this way. <br/>sorry, Rob. <br/>"Winners at War." <br/>Jeff: All right. Wearing red, we've got Tony, Wendell, Amber,  Kim, Sophie, Nick, Sarah, Yul, Sandra, and Tyson. Wearing blue, Sele, we've  got Natalie, Rob, Ethan, Parvati, Ben, Michele, Danni, Denise, Jeremy, and Adam.  Tony, third time out here. <br/>third time. <br/>Jeff: What's the feeling&amp; when you look at this group?  Because you will, for better or for worse, need these people to try the stay  in the game. <br/>I love the people I’m with.  I've played with Sarah in season 28. Sandra voted me off the second time and  I lost the game. So I love her for that. Red means we're red hot. We're on  fire. Let's see. <br/>Jeff: All right. Here's what you need to know about this  season. We're introducing a new "Survivor" currency in the form  tokens have value. You will each tart the game with one fire token. If you  are voted out, you must will or bequeath your token to another player as you  head to that island right behind you, the isolated and unforgiving Edge of  Extinction. <br/>oh, boy. <br/>Jeff: Where you will await your chance to get back in this  game. <br/>Jeff: And one last thing. <br/>oh, my gosh. <br/>Jeff: Let me just say this: If being crowned the winner in  a season of all winners and earning $1 million in the process is not enough  to inspire you, how about $2 million? [cheering] the largest cash prize in  the history of reality shows. <br/>Jeff: All you got to do is win. All right. Well, you  barely got you feet wet. We have a challenge right here. It seems like a good  time to dive in. Let's get to your first challenge right now. Here's how it  works: You will race out in pairs to retrieve a ring. You'll hen battle your  way back. The first person with one hand on the ring, one hand on thing from  pole scores a point. The first tribe to three wins. Want to know what you're  playing for? <br/>oh, yeah. <br/>yeah. <br/>Jeff: Fire in the form of flint, still the fundamental  foundational building block of any tribe. It can get you off to a very fast  start, because for the losers, no fire and no rice until after the first  tribal council. That could be a very big setback. Oh, one last thing. <br/>what else? <br/>yeah? <br/>enough thing. <br/>Jeff: This challenge is also for immunity. <br/>oh. <br/>Jeff: Out of the gate, losers tribal council, and just  like that, somebody will be the first person voted out of "Survivor: Winners  at War." i'll give you a minute to strategize with your new tribe, and  we'll get it on. Here we go. All right we have our first matchup. It is Tyson  and Yul taking on Jeremy and Ethan. Here we go. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>let's go. <br/>Jeff: "Winners at War" is under way. <br/>go, Yul. <br/>Jeff: Two big guys battling for that ring. Tyson has it.  Ethan getting in on it now. Yul and Jeremy tying each other up. You've got to  get back with the ring and hand on that flagpole. Jeremy now in. Here comes Yul.  Yul digging. Yul inching closer and closer to that flagpole. And he's done  it. Dakal scores the first point in "Winners at War." Dakal leads  1-0. Next round is two women. It's going to be Sarah and Kim. <br/>come on, girls. <br/>Jeff: Taking on Parvati and Natalie. Here we go. Survivors  ready? Go! <br/>Jeff: Natalie swimming out quickly. Kim swimming. Natalie  and Kim racing for it. Natalie's going to get it. Natalie has it. <br/>go, go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: Now everybody is in on it. Kim fighting to take it  for Dakal. It is Kim and Sarah working together. And Natalie and Parvati  inching closer. That swell is going to help. Sele getting closer. Natalie  very close. Kim pulling her away now. Parvati trying to get there. <br/>come on, Parvati. <br/>Jeff: Kim fighting. Parvati has almost got it. No! Another  big surge from Kim. Kim has single-handedly pulling this ring closeer to Dakal.  Parvati and Natalie trying to pull it back. Kim getting very close. She's got  it. Dakal, what an epic battle. Dakal leads 2-0. <br/>that was awesome. <br/>Jeff: The men are up again. It is Wendell and Tony for Dakal.  It is Ben and boston Rob for Sele. They have to score to stay in it. Dakal  leads 2-0. We're playing the three. Tony and Wendell can win it right here  for Dakal. Survivors ready? Go! This is going to be a big battle there are  four big, strong dudes out there fighting for it. Ben all over Wendell. This  is not going to be easy for anybody. Rob now in on it. Tony now in on it. Ben  is pulling everybody back toward the Sele flag. Tony trying the take Rob out  of this, but it's not working. Rob continues to push forward, getting closer  to that first buoy. Rob trying to get there. Tony pulling him back. Rob got  it! Sele scores, and it's 2-1. Another huge battle. It's going to be Denise  and Natalie taking on Amber and Sarah for the win for Dakal. If they score,  it's over. Denise and Natalie have to score to stay in it. Tribal council is  on the line. Survivors ready. Go! This could be it. Sarah and Amber could win  it right here for Dakal. <br/>let's go, Sarah. <br/>come on, Sarah. You got it. <br/>Jeff: It is Amber and Natalie tied up quickly. Denise has Sarah  trying to take her out of this. If blue does not score, it's over. Natalie  and Denise are on the right side of this challenge. They're inching close and  closer, but here comes Sarah and Amber trying to win it for Dakal. Natalie  digging in again. Denise digging in. <br/>Sarah! Sarah! <br/>Jeff: Dakal getting some support from their time. <br/>Amber, Amber! <br/>Jeff: Here comes Denise trying to get Amber out of it. She  is not going to be deterred. Amber closer and closer. Sarah reaching. No!  Natalie pulls it back. Sarah's got it. Dakal wins immunity, sending Sele the  tribal council. Epic first challenge. Wow. Everybody playing for keeps on  this season. Well, first challenge of the season lived up to the title of the  season, "Winners at War." Dakal, you pulled it out. Immunity is  yours. [applause] fire in the form of flint, and more importantly, nobody  from Dakal going home. Here's map the your new home. Nice catch, Sophie. Grab  your stuff, head out, and good luck. <br/>Jeff: All right. Sele, heading back the camp, you'll have  no fire. You will also have no rice waiting for you. Bigger than, that  somebody from your tribe will be the first person voted out of Winners at War,  and to complicate things a little more, tribal council will not be tonight.  It will be tomorrow night. You all came to play, this gives you plenty of  time to make things happen. Here's map to your home. Head out, good luck.  I'll see you at tribal council tomorrow night. <br/>the lose the immunity challenge on day one,s that my worst  fear, because we're playing Winners at War "Survivor," which means  there is no easy target. But somebody has to go. <br/>home sweet home. <br/>yeah, right? <br/>we get to our island, and I’m thinking, I can't believe  this is happening. I was just super happy to be on "Survivor"  again, especially an all-winners edition, but seeing all these people and  realizing how long ago I played, it's die of overwhelming. <br/>check this out. <br/>it says, "use your fire tokens to purchase any of  these items. Present fire tobins at any challenge, coffee and pastry, small  bag of bean, two pillow, two blankets. The advantage in the challenge is more  tokens." <br/>we're given an in-game currency called a fire token. In my  opinion, these tokens are going to end up being a huge part of the game. <br/>this fire token cannot be stolen from you. If voted out,  you must bequeath it to any player still in the game. <br/>I think the winner of  this season will be the person who is able to use the currency correctly. I  am from the newer seasons where we're used to twists. We understand there's  unpredictable facets of the game, so I think my chances to win this game got  much higher. <br/>so we're looking for bamboo and wood. <br/>you could do log cabin style. It raises it easier. <br/>do you want us to find bamboo? <br/>I wasn't signing up for this. <br/>furniture maker Wendell? <br/>after winning "Survivor" season 36 "guest  -- ghost island," I think people know me as someone who knows how to  build. This season I was trying to come out here and not build as much. I  wanted to build relationships. I didn't necessarily want to build the whole  shelter again. I think we're good. We'll hammer a stake in right here. This  isn't going anywhere. Because when you're busy building, you're stuck at  camp. It's like being stuck in a corner at party. <br/>made by Wendell design? <br/>something like that <br/>but I also know this talent pool is different. It's all  winners. So I’m going to play my position and be cool, chill out a little  bit, just get a read on everyone. <br/>I did not think i'd see  you out here. <br/>really? <br/>well, I mean, you got four little ones at home. <br/>I know. It wasn't -- it  was an easy decision, but it wasn't easy. I got them all calendars <br/>I did the same thing,  except -- <br/>I made a daisy chain? <br/>what's the daisy chain? <br/>the pieces of paper all looped an you pull one link off  every day <br/>why didn't you tell us all this? <br/>honestly, "Survivor" has been my profession the  last 12 years. The thing that has made winning the $1 million so great is I’m  able to spend time with my kids at home every day, and I don't want the cry  on day one here, but it's like I know everybody does the 9:00 until 5:00, but  I can't. Not too much, guys. <br/>just when I think you're only here for good looks and  laughs, you do this <br/>I get to get up every  morning with my during and hang out pretty much all day every day. So even  coming out here for a while is a big deal because i've never left them for  more than a couple days at time. I'm grateful for that. <br/>how you doing, queen in <br/>don't this that <br/>looking good. <br/>don't call me "queen." it will put a target on  my back. You ask anybody that's a "Survivor" fan who is the queen,  and they will tell you it's me. I'm the only person here that knows what it's  like to win twice. The history of "game changers" is I got Tony  voted out and Sarah. "Winners at War." <br/>welcome to season 40. <br/>I know what it's like to  go up against toney. I know what it's like to go up against Sarah. I played  on game changers with them, an me and Tony had it out. <br/>second person voted out of "Survivor: Game changers,"  Tony. <br/>that's what you get for plotting against me. And queen  stays queen. I know everyone wants a piece of me. <br/>you happy to be here? <br/>even with me? <br/>no hard feelings, you know that? <br/>water under the bridge? <br/>still under the bridge. <br/>they all want what I already have, which is my crown. <br/>how about it for season 40, huh? <br/>season 40! <br/>obviously I have a huge target on myself. I just was on  season 39 where they built an idol of me. <br/>you're sort of our shelter expert. <br/>resident builder. <br/>by losing in the beginning, I’m already putting myself at  a huge disadvantage. <br/>it's going to take some work. It will take all of us, but  we can do it. Work as a team, you know. Fortunately now we have to built a  shelter and vote somebody off. The game is on already. <br/>congrats on the baby. <br/>thank you. <br/>hi, Rob, Michele. <br/>hi. Don't make me talk about itful or i'll immediately  start crying. <br/>it's been ten years since i've played the game. And it's a  little strange to be playing this game connecting over babies. <br/>you have four kids. <br/>I have four, too. Once  was. The last two times I was a single girl. <br/>do you want a pickingy back? <br/>but I’m a mom now. I'm married. And I left my  ten-month-old baby at home with my husband. Oh, my gosh, it's just... It hits  me when I think about her. I'm going to need your support. Being a mom is a  new life change that can help me to relate the people in a totally different  way. So I’m totally using the mom card. Are you kidding me? <br/>I can't believe you guys  have four children. <br/>somebody found something they were good at. <br/>it's nice to be here. <br/>I’m happy here, bro. You  look great. Everything good in <br/>everything's good, man. Going through cancer, it's hard,  but life after cancer, that's when it really got tough. The fear of relapse,  the fear of death, it's with you all the time. It's not a way to live your  life. And being here, saying yes to an all-winners edition of "Survivor,"  this is living. <br/>when was the last time played? <br/>2004. <br/>oh, wow <br/>and I want the resurrect that 27 year old young, innocent,  guy to come back and play this game, the game that I love. The game that  changed my life. <br/>nice, Ethan. [growls] <br/>I did push-ups yesterday.  I'm really happy to be here. I'm excited to see how I play in this new era of  "Survivor." like we played with like no idols, no hidden  immunities, no chance to get back in the game. So I’m back and I’m ready to  play, and everyone better watch out. <br/>is that a trail up there? <br/>are we on the trail? There's no trail that goes that way,  though, so I think we have to keep going this way. <br/>okay. <br/>and I would like to not go. I'm wearing blue again. And... <br/>I know. I know. <br/>I was thinking -- <br/>losing that very first challenge, I was like, oh, my God,  here we go again. I had flashbacks. <br/>matsing loses for the fourth straight time. <br/>we lost every challenge, so I went to every tribal  council. At least I had that alliance with malcolm. <br/>if I could be your malcolm, it would be my dream come  true. <br/>my jungle boy number two. <br/>can that happen? <br/>I have to be able to read  somebody and have that gut feeling. <br/>do you have that with me? <br/>I do. <br/>I have that with you,  because I loved watching you on television, seriously. <br/>where is everybody? <br/>let's count. One, the work three, four, five. <br/>where's Adam? <br/>where's Denise? <br/>we're missing Adam. <br/>and Denise. <br/>Denise and Adam, they walk off. Really cookie moves for  winners to do that is unheard of. <br/>easy target, Adam. <br/>people are just looking for something, and it's so early  in the game, you don't want the rock the boat. When you rock the boat,  sometimes you fall out. <br/>teamwork makes the dream work <br/>Yul, see what happens when you have to maintain a low  profile like myself? I can't go nowhere. <br/>is the pratsly want the immunity idol, especially for a  season like this, and oh, my God, it took everything out of me not to just  take off running and look for an idol. <br/>I know you want to -- <br/>no, no, no. That's all right. <br/>I seen what happened to  me on "game changers" my first 30 seconds I ran around the whole  island three times. Hey, you guys do nice-nice. I'm looking for the idol. I  novi to stay here because I’m on probation. I'm right here. I got a bracelet  on. House arrest. But right now I don't want to put a target on my back by  showing them that I’m back to the old Tony antics. So I want everybody to get  nice and comfortable with me, because their guard is slowly coming down as  they see Tony around the camp all day, all night. When it gets down to here,  that's where the sucker punch comes in. <br/>people seemed pretty comfortable when we got here. They  wanted to work on the shelter and do this and do that. I'm thinking, am I supposed  to because I feel like I do have a big target on my back, the fact that Rob and  I are both out here. I had a hard time at first challenge. I was rooting at  my team -- I’m getting emotional -- but it was hard the root against my  husband. I'm his biggest fan. I feel like people think we have this huge  advantage because we're out here together, but I feel like it's probably more  a disadvantage than it is an advantage. But I learned a lot from my husband.  This game never stops. As soon as you sit back an relax, that's when  something goes wrong. So i've got the take advantage of this time. I've got  to do it. <br/>I’m super glad you're in  my tribe. I would love to work with you. <br/>really? You can punctuate that with more. <br/>what? <br/>I feel like i've been  asked out on a date. I want to work with you. <br/>when I played cook island, I tried to play a very  rational, strategic game. I used a lot of game theory. <br/>it's so nice talking to you. You're a sane human. <br/>but this season I think my biggest challenge will be  coming in disconnected. I haven't been part of the "Survivor"  community. A lot of these people have played with each other, they know each  other some Kim played poker with Rob and Tyson, so there's that connection.  Some people play multiple times. We have boston Rob. You have Tyson. They  played together. They're like best friends. And they not only played "Survivor"  together, they played poker together. They also played with Kim and Jeremy. I  remember watching one video where Tyson actually said something to the effect  of, hey, if we're ever on an island, this is going to be the pour alliance. <br/>if we all find ourselves on the alliance, we'll definitely  with the power alliance. <br/>definitely. <br/>obviously. <br/>duh <br/>but I think there are enough people like us who are not  super connected. <br/>it's almost like me, Nick, and Wendell are more of the  free agents, an you have Sandra, toby, -- Tony and Sarah who all played  together. You have Kim, Tyson and Amber. Right now I think you have the cool  person alliance of Kim and Amber and Tyson, who all are telling jokes all the  time and looking pretty. Then you have on the other side, the gritty group,  which is Tony, Sandra, and Sarah. They have all played together in the past.  And then you have a couple of us in the middle. I would put pietion and Yul  in that position. <br/>everything I heard about you from other people has all  been positive. Everyone says great things <br/>you, too. <br/>people talk about having shields around. I feel like I have  a nerd shield in Yul. Ly never be the smartest person as long as I have Yul  there talking about physics or whatever. But I think the number-one thing on  my mind is not who I want to work with, it's who I want out. <br/>I got an octopus and  crab, two of them. <br/>so do you want to work together this season in <br/>that would be a change, wouldn't it? <br/>I feel like I’m asking  you to prom. <br/>do you want to give me a corsage, take some time and get  some flowers and make it official. <br/>I think you and I are  probably know the game better than anybody else, and I think if we work  together -- <br/>Rob and I have a history that is a checkered past, to say  the least. Rob went after me in "heroes v. Villains." and I was  partly responsible for him getting out premerge. So I don't know how Rob is  going to want the play with me? <br/>we have an uphill battle. I don't think we should let the  new school people dictate how it's going to go <br/>oh, yeah? I like Rob. I think he's someone I can trust,  because I doubt that he has very many other options. <br/>so last time you were coming at me. <br/>because we didn't get on the same page from the beginning.  So I said the myself, see if we get on the same page from the outset. <br/>I’m down. <br/>let's have fun. <br/>let's do it. <br/>these kids ain't going to know what hit 'em. <br/>this is "Survivor." we have to think long-term  too, what can be established. <br/>he had a statue built. Would be you like to have a statue? <br/>not yet. <br/>"Survivor: Guatemala," it was a whole different  style play. Coming into this I was a little nervous. There's a lot of people  very connected. I don't know what you all are, I’m not. Tyson and Rob are pretty  close. <br/>I know we won't get very  many opportunities to get rid of major targets like Rob. When you get that  opportunity -- he's well liked. He's connected. And he knows how to play this  game. If you have the opportunity to remove that from your game, why would  wow not take it? <br/>names are getting thrown out. I don't know how I found  myself with all these winners. It's very humbling to be around all these  greats. <br/>whose names have you heard? <br/>i've heard yours. <br/>who said my name? <br/>S be Rob is phenomenal at what he does? You're not going to tell  me? Why are you not trusting me? <br/>I’m trying to remember  who said it <br/>come on. <br/>it's just insane to see him work in real life. Right, you  watch him on tv, oh, my God, how is this guy doing it. <br/>one of the girls. <br/>see this right now, you're not telling me, make me feel  like I can't trust you, bro. <br/>then you're on the receiving end of boston Rob's magic,  and it's like, yeah, yeah, blah. <br/>Danni. <br/>Danni threw out my name? Why? What did she say? <br/>because you're boston Rob. <br/>here's my information. There you go, bud. You got it. <br/>what did she say? You're good. <br/>I’m just asking what she  said, man. <br/>you played four or five times <br/>I was star struck and  told him everything. I shouldn't have done that. <br/>so let me ask you, if I ask you a question right now, will  you tell me the truth? Somebody came to me and told me that you already threw  my name out. Is it true? <br/>well, I threw everybody. Everybody is a target, yeah. <br/>okay. That's cool. <br/>because one of my concerns would be all the connections. I  have no connections. I have none. <br/>I totally understand it,  and I can see that you're coming from a place of being out here and don't  have anybody either. <br/>I respect the fact that Danni  told me the truth. Had she lied to me in the moment, I would know without a  shadow of a doubt that I couldn't trust her. <br/>I would be willing to  work with you. <br/>the fact that you told me the truth, I respect that so  mump, and I’m totally willing to work with you, but I need. <br/>it looks like there might be an old-school alliance coming  together, Ethan, Parvati, Danni, myself. The old-school guy, we got a rapport  with each other. See, this is what they don't do, the new school people. They  don't have fun. They don't get to know anybody, you know. <br/>if we can get through this vote tomorrow, it would be  mutually Beneficial for us to work together, showing the new kids the ropes. <br/>I did not sleep one wink  last night. We're going to tribal council tonight. <br/>we have the make a decision by tonight. <br/>I know <br/>and one out of the ten of us is going to be the first  person voted out of this game, and we're going to have the live alone on the Edge  of Extinction. I am scared <br/>I am scared. I don't feel  comfortable. <br/>people are paranoid. <br/>including me. <br/>I feel so paranoid. I  don't know. <br/>playing with winners makes everyone more paranoid. I also  think it's just something about that first person being voted out of the game  that you just don't want to be that person. <br/>we're going to pull someone in to vote at boston Rob <br/>me, you and nat have a good connection. <br/>I’m so down with that <br/>I don't trust anybody. <br/>the pace of the game is warp speed. I am so unaccustomed  to this. I have no clue that's going on. <br/>I feel like I’m going to  throw up right now. At this point I’m with Rob. <br/>I thought we'd have more  time to get into the groove, but there's in time for that. <br/>what do you think? <br/>what do I think? <br/>my relationship with Jeremy started before <br/>you're the only one I trust here. Nobody else <br/>I connected with him  right away. He was my number one until he got blindsided and then I played  for Jeremy the rest of my season. So it's not blood, but it's pretty close  with Jeremy. If I had to pick one now, I think Adam. <br/>more than Denise? <br/>I don't know. <br/>when Adam and Denise disappeared together, that was strike  one. I don't need a second reason to try and say no, not them. Pick one,  let's get it done. <br/>who you voting off? <br/>Denise and Adam are the ones that walked off. <br/>they got lost, but they had the map. <br/>take your pick. <br/>names are being thrown out. Nobody really wants to pin 'em  down, but like Denise is being thrown out. Adam is being thrown out. One, not  me. Two, it's not me. Three, it's not me. Four, it's not me. It's a good time  to talk. But my gut is telling me to keep Adam safe because he knows the  game, an he night know how the maneuver through this. So I got to go with my  gut. <br/>you and Denise went off looking for -- <br/>we didn't go look for an idol. <br/>you know how this game goes. That's group consensus.  Everybody needs a target. The easy target from the get-go was you and Denise. <br/>I went to look for the  water well with Denise. Were we having a strategic conversation along the  way? Of course. That shouldn't be like the end of the world. <br/>Adam or Jeremy? <br/>they should be way more worried about Natalie and Jeremy's  existing relationship coming into this game, Rob and Amber's marriage than me  going off with Denise. <br/>they said you and me as the potential target <br/>oh, great. <br/>we're going to fix that problem tonight. <br/>Jeremy and Natalie? <br/>not sure, which but between Jeremy and Natalie. <br/>would you be willing the take a big shot? <br/>at who? <br/>splitting up Jeremy and Natalie <br/>Adam came up to me and he said, what are your thoughts of  splitting the votes between Jeremy and Natalie. <br/>I don't mind, that you  know, I’m telling you, he's loyal. <br/>you think? <br/>Adam? <br/>I mean, because we got a  lot riding on this. <br/>okay. All right. <br/>Adam and Denise, neither one of them are trustworthy,  right? When Adam an Denise ran off, it put target on their back, but Natalie  and Jeremy are like this. They're thing as thieves. They've played together.  And I realize that's ironic coming from me, because my wife is in this game  with me. But the difference is she's on a whole other island. But for real,  the three of us work together until the end? <br/>yeah. I'm in <br/>I’m in a unique position.  I could basically choose which way I want to go. <br/>Rob doesn't care? <br/>new york I don't think anyone cares. <br/>we have to figure out. We don't have much time. <br/>I’m thinking Adam. <br/>okay. We just deciding, right? <br/>no, we did not. <br/>Danni or Adam <br/>there's cases for both. <br/>new york we got to think this through. <br/>right now we're voting out either Adam or Denise, but  there is this other plan where it's going to be Natalie or Jeremy. <br/>so it's what? <br/>we're literally about to go the tribal council. They still  haven't chosen between Denise or Adam. Is it me? Am I missing something? <br/>dude, everyone is losing their minds. <br/>I know they are. <br/>do you think everyone is just dumb or really scared? <br/>I don't know. I don't  know, because like look, you want to know how stupid this feels? Like you and  I are probably the biggest targets, and I don't think feel too worried <br/>me either. <br/>like what's wrong with that? That's not supposed to be  the% way it is. I know, usually when you feel <br/>Rob and I are like, are we being punked? <br/>this is pretty bad. We have the play "Survivor"  for everybody. The two of us are playing for ten people. <br/>we are very obviously the two bggest threats this this  game, and what is going on? People are so terrified to say the name of  somebody, but past chicken. We have to go to tribal council. If you don't  tell white house the vote is going to be, then what's going to happen at  tribal? It just doesn't seem to be a very fully baked plan. Saddle up, kids.  It's going to be a bumpy ride. <br/>Jeff: Behind each of you is a torch. Grab a torch. Dip it  in, and get fire. This is part of the ritual at tribal council, because in  this game, fire still represents your life. When your fire is gone, so are  you. That is going to be the case for somebody tonight. So Ethan, let's start  with just the culture shock of being back out living in a jungle sleeping on  bamboo. What's it been like? <br/>I mean, the pace of this  game is shocking to me compared to the last time I played. That was like  glacial speed. <br/>Jeff: You're not even talking about shelter. You're just  talking about strategy? <br/>oh, yeah. Were you talking about shelter? <br/>Jeff: Rob, like Ethan, it's been a while since you played.  Are you feeling, that as well? <br/>absolutely. The game has einvolved. It's now at pace  that's lightning fast, and you get in line or get out. <br/>Jeff: Wow. <br/>Jeff, we landed on that beach, and there were people that  were gone, literally gone. <br/>Jeff: Jeremy, who was missing? <br/>I don't remember. <br/>Jeff: Denise, the tribe lives together, knows what  happened, and there's reluctance to tell me. I just want to be a part. It's  me. It's me <br/>yes. Yes. Well, i'll throw myself under the bus because I was  one of the dummies that told -- pulled the worst "Survivor"  mistake. Adam and I had the map. We tried the find the water well. We got  lost. We were gone way too long. As innocent as it may have been, it doesn't  matter. Perception is everything. So I’m not starting on a grand note. <br/>Jeff: Adam, in a season of winners, it's tough to use as  the excuse, I got lost. <br/>Denise and I met yesterday. And this is the relationship  that you're worried about? There are people here who go back years. We have  one person here who is married to somebody else on the cast. <br/>there's a reason to vote off every single person up here.  Everybody here has won the game. Everybody has a target. <br/>Jeff: Natalie, the first tribal of any season comes with  one cloud that just looms over, which is, oh, just please not first. Does  that go through your head, because in your season, your sister was voted out  first. <br/>yeah. I can put my feet in nadiya's shoes, but I think I have  it way worse. One, I have Edge of Extinction waiter for me, and two, this is  "Winners at War." there's a lot more pressure on all of us so  whether it's a scapegoat excuse or not, once that seed has been set, that  picks up speed. Before they know it, that happened, they went out together,  and if that's the reason I can use, that's part of the strategy. <br/>Jeff: Adam. You can't be feeling any better at this point. <br/>no. <br/>we're Winners at War, Jeff. Everyone is holding a loaded  revolver behind their back, so no one should feel comfortable, and probably a  lot of people do feel comfortable. <br/>Jeff: Nobody should and a lot do. Jeremy, there it is. <br/>yeah, I don't like that answer that she gave at all  actually. I think when you come to tribal, though, this is where you find out  who has your back and who you can count on later on. <br/>Jeff: So Ben, what do you do, knowing tribal is looming  but nobody wants to say who they think it should be? <br/>my heart is racing right now. It's just honestly pounding.  I know you just asked the question, and I don't even know what it was. <br/>Jeff: Michele, even as I ask Ben, you put your hands in  you face. <br/>I feel like I’m a calm  person in my regular life, that's how I played the last game, but every word  can be skewed and twisted. My head is on a spinner. I feel like I’m trying to  hold on. <br/>Jeff, I’m not the calmest person on the outside of the  game, and you put me in here and it's war of the worlds going on. You're just  freaking out. I think there are plans in place, people that were out here  telling me, but now when people are like, Michele's dropping bombs like  anxious people, now it's all in my head. It's paralyzing. <br/>Jeff: That's a fascinating thing. So everybody here has  won this game, and everybody here is saying they're paNicked. <br/>but I have never felt this nervous <br/>that's comforting. <br/>my entire season. <br/>not to mention it's $2 million. We didn't bring that up  for conversation. Like the biggest prize ever in the history of "Survivor."  that's something that's going through people's minds, as well. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Adam, you're up. <br/>okay. Please let this not be me tonight. <br/>it's good to be back. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Jeff: If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want  the play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. First  vote Denise. Adam. Denise. Two votes Denise. Natalie. Natalie. We're tied,  two votes Denise, two votes Natalie, one vote Adam. Natalie. Natalie. That's  four votes Natalie, two votes Denise, one vote Adam. First person voted out  of "Survivor: Winners at War," Natalie. That's five. That's enough.  You need to bring me your torch. Natalie, the tribe has spoken. Time for you  to go. <br/>bequeath your fire token to any player still in the game. <br/>bequeath your fire token to any player still in the game.  I don't think it's hit me that I just got voted off first. It's really weird.  Holding my own torch, I have never picked up a torch at tribal council. I  have never got voted off, but after so much expectations for myself here on Edge  of Extinction, I thought I would be crying, but I’m just mad. This is the Edge  of Extinction. You will have to work hard for everything. If lonliness sets  in, you must find resolve to overcome. If you are industrious, you can earn  fire tokens to help you get back in the game. If at any point you wish to end  your adventure, raise your sail and the boat will pick you up. The tokens are  cool. The sign says "back in the game." that might be in limbo for  now, but there is still a chance for me. <br/>so Yul, how are you feeling? Are you a free agent? <br/>I don't know anybody. I  would be happy to work with anyone who wants to work with me. <br/>that's my philosophy. <br/>me, too, especially if people are already like family  outside the game. How do you infiltrate that? <br/>that's what I’m mostly worried about. <br/>family. <br/>they are. <br/>it's very rare for me the take something so personal, and  to feel so hurt about it, but back on islands of the idol, boston Rob told me  that he would never come out here. After spending 36 days with boston Rob and  listening to him say that he would not come out here -- <br/>wait, he flat out said "i won't play? <br/>fts <br/>he said, "i will not play. <br/>he lied to you for 36 days. <br/>I said I didn't want the  play with my emotions. I wanted to play a strategic game. But it's just that  every time I see Amber, which is all day, I just think about it. So if the  opportunity arises, Amber would be the among the first to go if I have  anything to say about that. <br/>we have the stick together. <br/>I agree. I think we  should group the odd ones out. I feel like I’m the odd one out. <br/>so would you have any problems trying the break up that  whole thing, that poker thing? People are trying to recruit soldiers into  their alliances. Sarah and Sandra, they're trying to align all the  unconnected people, but that alliance, which is basically people who are  one-tim players and fairly disconnected from other winners, is actually the  alliance that i've been organizing, and that is me, Nick, Wendell, and Sophie.  Wendell, so are you totally on board with us? <br/>100%. I'm locked and loaded. <br/>we're in a way better position than I ever thawing we  would be coming into this game. The fact that I was worried that being  unconnected we would be at a disadvantage. The fact that we are unconnected  an we're in the center gives us all the leverage, so that's helpful. I think Sandra  really is gunning for Rob. <br/>I believe that Amber and Rob  should definitely get to the Edge of Extinction as soon as possible <br/>I am locked and loaded  with our four. <br/>okay. I am wary about everyone else out of our four. <br/>the great thing is I don't think people even know this  alliances exists. With Sandra as well as with Sarah, we'll have the numbers.  In fact, we'll control the game. <br/>how are you doing? <br/>all right. Better than I was last night I suppose. <br/>all right. Tribal probably couldn't have gone worse. It  sucked that Natalie went home, but it sucked more that I was left out of the  vote. I went into this feeling like so much pressure, because I feel like I had  something to prove. People were a bit surprised by my win when I was up  against people who played bigger, trashier games than me. <br/>the winner of "Survivor," Michele. <br/>and now to not have the numbers is the worst possible case  scenario. <br/>Rob and Parvati are pulling the wool over our eyes <br/>Rob is pretending he's not running the show, and he's  running the show. <br/>this ole-school camp is intimidating. They're good at what  they do. So myself, Michele, Jeremy, and Adam, we need to figure out how to  stop this leash leading, because we're like a bunch of goats. We can take  control of this part of the game. <br/>okay. Cool. <br/>it really sucked loseing. But this season when somebody  gets voted out, they can bequeath a fire stoken with anyone in the game. We  all started off with one fire token. This morning I see a fire token. Yeah,  nat. I knew you had my back. I'm going to get 'em for you, though. So now I got  two fire tokens. Two is better than one. I have the most out of anybody here.  So I’m the richest on this island. Nobody knows how valuable they are, so  it's good to have two of them. And let's just wait on it and see where this  game starts going to see how important they are. To see how important they  are. <br/>what is this? Edge of extinction kit. Use fire tokens to  purchase any of the following. Idol with full power three tokens. One pizza,  peanut butter, bottle of wine, six pack of cold beer. All right. I had one  token. I had to give it up before I get here, so I’m thinking about what's  the key to me accumulating enough to either get an idol or get an advantage  in the challenge? And that's when I saw the bottle. This is your first  opportunity to get back in the game by earning a fire token. Journey to the  last spot you can see the sun set. It did make me excited that I might be  able to get back into the game and have a shot at that $2 million. That's  still up on the table for me. Rises in the east, sets in the west. I'm not  good at riddles. My niz cal strength is something I always rely on, but I’m embracing  testing my mental strength. I remember the sun rising in one spot. So I thought  if I get higher I would see the sun set. So I thought if I get higher I would  see the sun set. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, this is like a mile. At the top of  the island, my quads are just burning. It said that you would have to work  hard for everything, but I’m not sure how much harder it can get out here to  get tokens. Keep going until the last place I can see the sun set. My first  time around playing in nicaragua, nadiya, my twin sister was the first voted  off. That forced me to grind until I won that season. <br/>Jeff: The winner of "Survivor: San juan." <br/>that forced me to wore hard. I didn't come here. <br/>you can sell this to any player from a losing tribe for  one fire token. <br/>on the plaque was instructions on how I could get my first  token along with this little pouch. The pouch was an immunity idol. Even  though I want the keep the idol, it has no value on this beach. I have to  pick a person from the losing tribe, and then they will have this opportunity  to buy my immunity idol in exchange for their token. I'm first person here,  and I’m already affecting the game. That's totally different from the last Edge  of Extinction. So although I don't get the excitement of having an idol and  politician an idol, things I do here have a ripple effect on the game. It can  end up changing the entire course of the season. During the game, still  playing from the other side. Amazing. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. Dakal getting your first look at  the new Sele tribe. Natalie voted out in the first tribal council. All right.  You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>yes. <br/>Jeff: First things first, Sandra, got to take it back. Thank  you. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're  going to paddle out and retrieve a bag of number tiles. You'll then race back  over a series of obstacles. You'll then use those tiles to release three  rings and attempt release o land those rings on th paddles. The first tribe  to finish wins immunity, safe from the vote. Losers tribal council where  somebody will be the second person voted out of "Survivor" Winners  at War. Dakal, you have one extra person. You're sitting somebody out. Who is  it going to be? Sandra going to sit out. <br/>surprise. <br/>Jeff: Take a spot on the sitout Bench. Everyone else take  a minute to stratd jiez. We'll get started. Let's do it. All right. Here we  go. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! First stage, you got to paddle out.  Let's see how well you work together as a tribe. <br/>come on. Come on, come on, come on. <br/>one, two, three! <br/>Jeff: Sele quickly into the water. Dakal right behind. <br/>keep moving. <br/>go, go, go go, go,! <br/>go! <br/>Jeff: Now is where you move it right here. Sele runs into  their first obstacle. That opens the door for Dakal, who is very calm. <br/>good job, Dakal, good job. <br/>right side. Right side hard. <br/>Jeff: Dakal is going to get to their station first.  They're going to be untying. Sele can't get to their station. They're close.  But they're still too far. Sarah has the number tiles for Dakal. They're  headed back. Dakal now with a nice lead. Rob trying to pull them closer. <br/>harder! <br/>Jeff: Dakal there. They start untying. Sele trying to make  back time. Parvati trying the hold on. Rob still working on the knot. Rob  back on the boat. Got the start paddling again. Dakal, you got a loose end.  You're good. Everybody over the crates now. <br/>left side hard. Right side hard, right side hard, right  side hard! <br/>keep going, keep going, keep going. <br/>Jeff: There goes Dakal. Kim is in the water. You're good, Sele.  Start getting up those steps. Dakal is all in. They're heading to the barrel  roll. There goes Denise. There goes Danni. There's Adam. Dakal first to the  barrel roll. You've got to get everybody over. <br/>okay, push me over. <br/>Jeff: Sele is all in. They're trying to close this gap.  Tyson first over for Dakal. There goes Tony. Safe -- Sarah is over. It's  going to be Ethan trying to get over for Sele. And he's over. Dakal still in  the lead. It is very tough to get people over this barrel. Sele struggling  again as Dakal one person at a time, wow, Rob launches Parvati over,  literally threw her over the barrel. There goes Danni being launched. Rob is  single-handedly launching one tribe member after another over the barrel.  Dakal has everybody over. Now it's up the net crawl. <br/>good job, Dakal, good job! Come on, guys, you got it. We  mead this head start. We need it. Let's go, let's go! <br/>Jeff: Sele down to four guys left trying to get Adam over. <br/>you're looking fabulous. They're still spinning. Hey, Tony,  pay attention. Let's go. Eyes over here. <br/>Jeff: Dakal working on their combination. <br/>they're stuck on the wheel. Let's go. We need this lead. <br/>Jeff: There are three sets of numbers. Once you free those  rings, you can start tossing. <br/>get on my shoulders, ready? <br/>Jeff: Rob and Jeremy the last two. Jeremy trying. He can't  do it. Jeremy getting on the shoulders of Rob, who has been a workhorse in this  challenge. He has either lifted or supported everybody. Yul working on the  combination. No, got the try another. <br/>come on, come on. <br/>Jeff: Ben going to hoist Ethan on his back is Jeremy can  reach. Great teamwork by Sele. Wow. That is how you do it. <br/>pull me! Pull me! Pull me! <br/>Jeff: Sele has everybody across. Let's go. Yul still  working on the combination. And he's got it. Dakal has their rings free. It's  going to be tie isn't an Wendell tossing rings for Dakal. Sele trying to get  back. They're exhausted. They still have to solve their combination lock.  You're good, Sele. Start solving. Tyson going to switch out and give it to Wendell. <br/>yes! <br/>Jeff: Wendell has the first paddle. Now Adam trying the  solve that combination. Every part of Adam's body is twitching trying to  figure this combo out out and give dak doing a chance to really get in on  this. Just misses. Two left for Dakal as Adam continues to struggle on the  combination. He's got it. The rings are free. It's going to be Ben and Jeremy  tossing the rings for Sele. They have some work to do. Jeremy sticks the  first one and we are tied just like that, 1-1. This is why you always dig in  every challenge every step of the way. You are never out of it. And Jeremy  does it. Sele has their second ring. One ring left. <br/>come on, Jeremy. <br/>Jeff: Wendell to tie it up. It's on an off again for Wendell. <br/>you got this, Jeremy. <br/>Jeff: Jeremy for the win. And he does it! Sele wins  immunity, sending Dakal to tribal council. <br/>good job, guys. Good job, guys. Good job. You guys gave it  all. Good job, guys. <br/>Jeff: Sele, nice job. Nobody wants to go to tribal  back-to-back. <br/>get that. <br/>yeah, baby. <br/>Jeff: Sele, safe from tribal council. Nobody going home  from your tribe. Grab your stuff, head out. Enjoy the night off. <br/>Jeff: All right. Dakal. Grab your stuff, head back to  camp, and see you tonight at tribal where somebody will be the second person  voted out of "Survivor: Winners at War." <br/>winning the challenge, it's a great moment, but in the  back of my head I’m worried about having my wife on the other tribe. Amber  has a huge target on her because of me. I can't do anything to help her. So  in this moment, this is possibly my whiff's life in this game. <br/>stupid question, anyone want to keep nattily company,  volunteer for that? <br/>do you? <br/>hell no. <br/>I haven't done this in 13  years, what happens now? We go to tribal council? Anyone wants to talk to  anybody should just be civilized about it <br/>that would be a first. <br/>where are you guys at? <br/>so what are we going to do? <br/>what do you want to do? <br/>I would rather get out Amber <br/>I think it needs to be Nick  or Sandra <br/>I do, too. <br/>am I going to get in trouble for saying people? I think Sandra  or Nick. <br/>that will start a war. <br/>Sandra or Tony? I don't know. <br/>Tony or Sandra. We got to decide. <br/>everybody is running around like a chicken with its head  cut off. The first tribal is where things are revealed, who is working with  who. <br/>I’m with you guys. I want  the play with you guys. <br/>you know, I feel totally solid with Kim or Tyson. But  otherwise I’m loves. I'm not used to this style of play, but I better dive  in. <br/>the smarter move is Amber for her tie, but I weave Tyson  is a huge threat <br/>I have never seen this  much scrambling. This is different. <br/>this feels different. <br/>this season every single person is a threat. So everybody  is running around trying to make as many plans as possible. <br/>everybody ditched me. <br/>and the far get is constantly shifting. <br/>Wendell, Nick, Tony, Sandra, the whole crew. <br/>everybody is so out for blood, I think some of these  people think it's a reward to get to go to tribal, because they get to vote  somebody out. <br/>are we crazy not to get Sandra out first. <br/>when names are thrown out, she's the person who goes to  that person and says, your name has been thrown out. <br/>they'll get rid of you because you're shady. <br/>I’m going to spread  truth, lies and rumors. It works for me, and I can afford to do this, because  when we got back to camp from the challenge, I reach in my bag, and I find  this little baby. My first immunity idol on Winners at War. This is a hidden  immunity idol. It is good for your next three tribal councils, but it will  cost you one fire token. There's nothing to think about. I'm buying this  hidden immunity idol with my one fire token. Regardless. Now I’m starting to  realize the extreme importance of fire tokens, and I’m making the deal. I  want to think that Natalie might have sent it to me somehow from the Edge of  Extinction. I'm not sure, but I’m so relieved that I have this. If I get a  bad feeling on the pit of my stomach, I’m going to play this idol, because  there's a lot of names thrown out there. <br/>they're okay with Tony going tonight. <br/>discussions are constantly being had, and everything is in  flux. <br/>now it's you. <br/>now it's me. Tyson just said -- <br/>Tyson wants to vote me out. Come on, man, really? Let's  go. They see me calm and cool and laid down and relaxed. When I know it's  game on, I go straight to ten. <br/>we're going to tell Tyson no vote for Amber to split that  vote. We'll tell everybody we're going for Amber, but we're all voting for Tyson. <br/>we're voting out Tyson. <br/>he will get so blind sided. Tyson is very powerful and  dangerous. He's a funny guy. People love him. <br/>does anyone want the marvel at the splendor when we say  our prayers? Also be sure to include me, because thanking me for how  delicious this rice will probably be. [laughter] <br/>we got to break up the poker lines. Tyson, Amber, Kim, and  I want to get Tyson out of the game. Amber is not running around doing  anything. Plus you leave the biggest target, husband and wife, in the game  still as big shields. So Tyson goes home. <br/>how you doing? <br/>all right. <br/>my thoughts are I think basically the single biggest fear  that everyone has in the game is that Rob and Amber and this whole poker  alliance are going to dominate. That's the thing that seems to be galvanizing  everyone. <br/>I have your back 100%. <br/>the poker alliance is coming back the bite me. The second  I realize that things weren't going the direction I wanted them to, my  strategy switched from dictating the direction of the game to pure survival  mode. <br/>maybe Amber and Kim or -- <br/>they're super close. <br/>break them up one way or the other, but I’m with you guys,  if you're telling me this the way we're going. <br/>cool. <br/>I don't have anywhere to  go but into their warm pokey poisonous embrace. I feel bad for Kim and Amber,  but it's worth it to me to forfeit this battle to hopefully win the war. <br/>do you guys have someone in mind? <br/>it's me. <br/>do you have someone? <br/>new york but I feel like it's me. <br/>that's funny. <br/>you don't want to say it? <br/>I’m not saying nothing. <br/>all of a sudden I’m getting a very bad vibe from everyone.  I know that I am not someone that people want in their conversations right  now. There's moments of paranoia where lots of people are talking and I walk  up and it stops. They want to do something and they don't want me to know  about it. God, it's just awkward. <br/>do you want... <br/>so... What are you thinking? Nobody will talk. I have  never been in this position before. My season I was making the calls every  single tribal council. <br/>come on. You can tell me. Please trust me. <br/>this is such a bad feeling. <br/>give me a hug. <br/>I don't think I really  understood today what it feels like to be on the outs. This is not the way I envisioned  my comeback. I think what's going on is I think tie isn't and Amber and I are  in trouble for the same reason, and I think in this case the poker alliance  has become what that is. <br/>Tyson says he's going to vote against Amber or Kim. <br/>he's not with us. <br/>he's acting, man. He's acting. We'll see tonight. <br/>one of the three of us are being voted out. That's just  it. I think there's really nothing I can do to change that. I feel like this  is a large group of people voting together. To start this game the way I did  honestly, it's been the biggest mess. <br/>Jeff: Behind each of you is a torch go. Ahead head and  grab a torch. Dip it in and get fire. Some things never change. Some things  never change. Amber, you first played 20 years ago, but the last time you  played was 16 years ago. Kids that were born the last time you played are now  driving cars. How are you feeling with the game given itself full-on? <br/>well, first of all, I look exactly the same, I haven't  aged a bit. <br/>Jeff: 100%. <br/>that feeling of being on edge is definitely familiar,  however, it was happening much quicker than what I’m used. To I feel like if  I’m not on my toes moving at all time, I’m behind. <br/>Jeff: Tyson, when the game moves as fast as it moves now,  can you see a taste of different eras? <br/>yeah, for sure. I think the older era, especially like Yul,  he kind of observes before he acts. Some of the newer players immediately  act. <br/>Jeff: Tony, is he talking about you? <br/>I hope not. I'm nice and  slow, man. I'm stealing a page out of her book today. <br/>Jeff: Amber you don't seem to agree with the idea that Tony  was slow <br/>not at all. He was running around from person to person  today. It was quite nerve racking. <br/>weren't you? Wasn't everybody? I came the play. The first  two days I didn't need. To we won. Today I needed to talk about survival. <br/>Jeff: So today you were spar, getting ready, and you think  she thinks that's crazy? <br/>exactly my point <br/>I don't think it's crazy.  I'm more cool, calm, and collected <br/>Amber hasn't been around for a very, very long time. You  have to keep up with the pace or you're going to have the move out of the  way. That's just how it is. <br/>Jeff: So Sophie, what was the feeling as you guys started  to get closer and closer to tribal. Was it going like this, or did it reach a  flow and we got a plan? <br/>new york i'd say the day went like that. And it totally  dropped off. But it was scary because you didn't know, did I have the right  last conversation, but somebody here did not. <br/>Jeff: Sandra, what did you see happening today? <br/>there was panic, because there were several names thrown  out. But then the names were narrowed down to a very small group. <br/>Jeff: Kim, you're nodding <br/>yeah, I’m the small group that it got whittled down to. <br/>Jeff: How do you know your name got brought up <br/>gosh, it's a long story. <br/>Jeff: Give me the short version. Give me the headline. <br/>the headline is: Poker player alliance. Which doesn't  exist. I played in a poker game aier ago outside of the game, which is going  to turn out to come back and bite me <br/>Tyson, did you hear your name like Kim? <br/>for sure. I heard my name. I have to hope that what I did  was enough to prove to people that I’m here to be with them. <br/>but he's part of that poker crew, too. <br/>that's what's interesting to me. There are so many close  relationships that are so much closer than the poker player alliance that met  for three hours. Poker player alliance is not a thing. It's in the a thing.  If it is, I’m not in it. <br/>Jeff: Wendell, it's an interesting layer. "Survivor"  has been around so long that some of you guys have genuinely become friends. <br/>yeah, if there was a diagram, it would be all over the  place, because there are these four people from here and these two people met  here and these people played on this season and that season. So we don't know  how tight people that played poker one time a year ago would be. <br/>not close. <br/>not close according to Kim, not close, but you have to  take that into consideration. <br/>but when $2 million is at stake, I think friends are not  -- we're willing to do anything. <br/>Jeff: Wow. Nick, does the candor from Amber surprise you?  Just flat out sailing, it's $2 million, let's don't pretend. We'll kill each  other. <br/>yeah, that does surprise me. But I understand. I mean,  once they heard $2 million, they started thinking about putting that check in  their own pocket, not their friend's pocket and not anybody else's pocket. <br/>Jeff: Sophie, you're nodding. <br/>I’m excited about the  money. <br/>it's $2 million, Jeff. I mean, that in itself will cause a  lot of people to just do anything, and if friends have to be lost along the  way, then I think it's a price every single person out here will be willing  to pay. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Nick, you're up. I'll  go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the  play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. First  vote, Nick. Kim. Kim. Kim. Three votes Kim, one vote Nick. Amber. Amber. Two  votes Amber. We're tied. That's three votes Amber, three votes Kim, one vote Nick.  Amber. That's four votes Amber, three votes Kim, and the second person voted  out of "Survivor: Winners at War," Amber. That's five. That's  enough. You need bring me your torch. Amber, the tribe has spoken. Time for  you to go. <br/>I have one. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. "Survivor"  is looking for new players. It could be you. Apply now. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor," when the enemy strikes... <br/>it could be Sandra. If she voted my wife out, this is war. <br/>Jeff: And blows up your game. <br/>are you serious? <br/>Jeff: You'll need to climb out of the rubble. <br/>it's like 20 feet tall. <br/>you don't want to be the first. <br/>how is this guy still alive? <br/>I bet you're happy to see  me. You're not alone anymore. <br/>I can't believe my tribe  won. I wanted them to lose so bad. <br/>I knew I had a huge  target on my back. I put my trust in people hoping for the best, and it  wasn't the best.
