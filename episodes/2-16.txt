<br/>[ cheers and applause]  Gumbel: Nice, nice. Good evening and welcome back. It is a long way from the Australian Outback to our L.A. soundstage, where our castaways are tonight surrounded by an  audience of family, friends, and fans. Let's welcome individually, starting with our two finalists,  Tina Wesson, Colby Donaldson. Then the jurors, with whom we are all familiar. The Outback's resident chef, Keith Famie; the ever so sweet,  Elisabeth Filarski; her buddy Rodger Bingham; the youngest castaway,  22-year-old Amber Brkich; Harvard law student Nick Brown; the controversial  Jerri Manthey; and the oh-so-buff Alicia Calaway. And reuniting with their former tribe mates for the first time  since their days in the Outback, cheerleader Jeff Varner; burn victim Michael  Scupin; vegetarian Kimmi Kappenberg; the seven-footer, Mitchell Olson;  Maralyn "Mad Dog" Hershey; Captain Kel Gleason; and the first to  go, Debb Eaton. Good evening, everybody. <br/>ALL: Good evening, Bryant. [ applause and cheering]  Gumbel: Well, Ms. Wesson, what have you got to say for yourself? <br/>Tina: Oh, I just never believed it. <br/>Gumbel: Oh, come on. <br/>Tina: I never believed it. Never once. I never even thought about the voting process, who might be  voting for who. <br/>Gumbel: How could you go these months without thinking  about it even one time? <br/>Tina: Whenever Colby and I came back to camp that night  after Keith was gone, we felt like we had won, because this is what we wanted  to do whenever we joined with each other in alliance, this is what we wanted  to do, we wanted to make it to the last two. And that was winning for me. <br/>Gumbel: Yeah, but we're talking about a difference of  considerable jack between winning and being runner-up. <br/>Tina: It was not about the money. <br/>Colby: $900,000 In fact. [ laughter]  Gumbel: But who's counting? <br/>Tina: If this game had been for free, I would have done  it. If there was no prize at all, for free, I would have gone out  and played this game. <br/>Gumbel: Why did you do it, Colby? I mean, why did you do it? You know, it was a pretty magnanimous gesture. <br/>Colby: Oh, why did I choose Tina? <br/>Gumbel: Yeah. <br/>Colby: Oh, well... I thought you were asking something  else. Well, there are a lot of reasons, and I've thought about this  and tried to come up with something intelligent to say because I knew I'd be  asked this question. You know, and Tina's right. And it gets said so many times, that I was so driven to win and,  you know, I was so focused, and I was. I was very intense with what I wanted to do, but the game  changes for everyone, and it did change for me. And when Tina and I, we started becoming close, and it really  started when we voted Mitchell off instead of Keith. That's when we decided to play our game, and we did. We took this thing to the end. And that night was a victory for us, when we got to go back  together. And you know, the thing is, even though when I chose Tina to go  with me into the end, thus making it much more competitive on the final vote,  I've been able to sleep every night since then. I haven't lost one night of sleep worrying about whether or not  I would win because she deserved it. And that's the beauty of this game. It doesn't matter how many challenges I won or how many beans  and stew I ate all the time, it doesn't matter because it comes down to the  game itself. And there's a whole lot... there are so many factors involved,  and people can't understand that. I don't expect them to. <br/>Gumbel: Keith, how shocked were you when he said bye to  you instead of to Tina? <br/>Keith: You know, the last five days of the game, were  fairly enlightening to me just from a life standpoint. And I really felt that this game really wasn't about money. I gained a lot more out of it. I told my two very special people in my life, Josh and Alicia,  my kids, and of course Katrine my fianc√É   e now, I was just going to do the best I could do. Do the best I could do. And that's all I planned on doing the best I could do. I told my mom that. Do the best I could do with the game. <br/>Gumbel: But here's a guy sitting next to you who basically  gave up $900,000 because he didn't want you to have it. <br/>Keith: Well, you know, call Colby a fool then. No, you know what? I think that... and I agree with Colby, too. I'll be honest with you, if I would have... I would have  probably picked Tina to be in it in the end with me if I had won that  immunity challenge, I probably would have voted Colby out knowing that Tina  realistically would have beaten me. The game changes dramatically. When we had that flood, the time that flood hit, the game was  off. This was now about survival, living conditions, who you can  cohabitate with and just... and being able to build relationships. And for me, it was... Tina just really deserved it. <br/>Gumbel: But you weren't uncomfortable? I mean, we were listening to some of the things they were  talking about. They said, "Keith didn't earn the right." "We  dragged him along." "He didn't deserve the spot." "We put  up with him."  Keith: Oh, oh, that. <br/>Gumbel: "We used him." I mean come on. <br/>Keith: Trust me, Colby can play the game mentally better  that anybody. That stuff hurt. But I think that in the scope of the game, in the scope of the  game, when it comes down to the last three, when a decision like that is  made, it's huge. And you've got to really have some pretty valuable decisions  why. <br/>Gumbel: Tina got four votes. Jerri, Keith, we can assume. Who are the other two? Alicia and Elisabeth? Is that right? Why Tina? <br/>Alicia: Was it you, Elisabeth? <br/>Elisabeth: Yeah. <br/>Gumbel: Why Tina? <br/>Alicia: Because I think Tina just put it all together. Everybody said what was exactly the truth, that she had a  strategy coming into this. She played it until the very, very end, and she didn't win any  challenges, not one. <br/>Gumbel: You hold that against Colby that he did? <br/>Alicia: Not at all, but she had to be doing something  right to make it that far into the final two and that's strategy. It wasn't about winning challenges, it was about strategizing,  and that's what this is all about. And I think she deserved it. <br/>Gumbel: Elisabeth? <br/>Elisabeth: I said when I voted, this was the most  difficult vote that I had to make because the two people sitting there, I had  just developed such a respect and love for in the Outback as people. And I knew Colby's... Colby's potential is outstanding, and I  also knew that Tina had decided, you know, prior to all the voting that, you  know, what she was going to do with the money. I just really took heart to, I really did. And as we all know, I'm an emotional person, so...  Gumbel: Yes, you are. <br/>Elisabeth: Guess how I voted? By my heart. <br/>Gumbel: Looking at the Colby voting block right behind you  there, with Rodger, Amber and Nick, why Colby, guys? <br/>Nick: Well, at least for me, I mean, if you make it to the  final two, it's not easy to say who deserved it more and who played the game  better. I mean, they did it differently to get to the final two. But, for me, I just voted for the person who I thought, outside  the context of the game, who really tried to get to know me. And at that point in the game, Colby and I had conversated about  a number of things and I just felt we related. <br/>Gumbel: It didn't help that he said you'd have been the  one that was sitting there if he wasn't. <br/>Colby: The question played a part of it, because he didn't  quite answer it, but, uh...  Gumbel: Amber, Rodger, what about it, why Colby? <br/>Amber: It was a hard decision. With Elisabeth, I was going back and forth the whole entire day. And up until the last minute before, even after I asked my  question, they both gave great answers. The Harley and then the charity, you know. <br/>Gumbel: Rodger, what about you? <br/>Amber: But... I'm sorry. <br/>Gumbel: Go ahead. <br/>Amber: I just... I don't know. I just went with my gut, and I just thought Colby had... I mean  he had played so awesome and had won all those challenges. I mean, he won every single immunity besides two, I think, and I  just think that's incredible. And I don't know...  Rodger: For me, it was a very, very hard vote. And even after I voted for Colby, which has been several weeks  now, I think, "Oh, I should have voted for Tina," and then I think,  "No, I was right." And I've switched back and forth. And I was glad to see it come down to a 4-3 vote tonight because  that says a lot about both of those individuals sitting there tonight. <br/>Gumbel: Colby, is there something wrong with the game-- I  know Mark Burnett's sitting out here. He's upset at me for asking this. But is there something wrong with a game that you dominate so  thoroughly and don't win? <br/>Colby: No, absolutely not. <br/>Rodger: He's 30 years younger than me, that's why. <br/>Gumbel: Me too. Don't worry about it. You and I are the same age, so let's not do this. <br/>Colby: In a lot of it, I mean, I was very fortunate. Let's put things into perspective. If Mike's accident hadn't happened, I wouldn't be sitting in the  top two, that's for sure. You know, there are a lot of very fortunate instances. <br/>Gumbel: And there's one final thing that we should share  for the first time tonight that nobody knows, which is two weeks before this  got started, you weren't going. <br/>Colby: That's right. <br/>Gumbel: You weren't on this, were you? <br/>Tina: No, sir, I was not. I was not picked for the original show. <br/>Gumbel: You were in reserve. <br/>Tina: I was an alternate. And I was so disappointed, I've got to tell you. And my husband kept saying, "Honey, they're going to call  you back." And I'm, like, "They're not going to call me back, honey. They already made their decision." Three days that went on,  and they called me back on Monday. <br/>Gumbel: How good is that? How good is that? <br/>Tina: That's great. <br/>Gumbel: Hey, sit tight. We're going to come back in just a moment because as all our  castaways can readily attest, their time in Australia, truly was about  survival of the most basic sort. When we come back, we'll talk about the hunger and the hardships  they all endured in the Outback. We're back after this. <br/>Tina: One of the most We're back after this. <br/>Tina: One of the most important survival tips that I can  give you is that you must be agile enough to get up in the tree canopies just  like the koala bears to get that precious fruit. [ screams] [ laughter] [ applause]  Tina: Oh...  Gumbel: It worked. <br/>Tina: There you go. <br/>Gumbel: It worked. It got you onboard. <br/>Tina: But you said they were cheesy. You were mean...  Gumbel: You're right, it wasn't... You're right. I did, but you know what? The other little secret we should tell is this guy was supposed  to be part of the first one... and, um, didn't quite make it, and so they put  him on the second one. You were... you were supposed to go head-to-head with Richard,  weren't you? <br/>Keith: I was. And actually, I'm glad I had the opportunity to do the  Australian Outback. I... This-- the bond I've made with these individuals has  been... is lifelong. It's-it's memorable, and it'll be forever. It's great. <br/>Gumbel: We're going to talk friends and enemies in our  next segment. I want to try to talk, if I could, hunger and hardships, um, for  a little while, because it was tough out there-- at least it appeared to us  as we were watching it. Nobody suffered a greater hardship perhaps than the gentleman in  the back row. Michael, first of all, show us your hands. Not bad. Not bad. [ applause]  Michael: I'm real fortunate. <br/>Gumbel: I think any of us who saw this will not soon  forget it. Um, but you've said in a funny kind of way, it was something  good that happened to you. How come? <br/>Michael: You know, y-your motivations for going on the  show are so much different at the beginning, and, like, people have been  talking about, you know, what happens just... it-it transcend-transcends  money or prizes or anything. And the-the-the spiritual growth and the family growth... I  mean, my kids and my wife and my mom and just everybody-- it's just...  it's-it's the greatest experience, and... what happened to me was... A  million bucks couldn't buy it. [ applause]  Gumbel: I believe... I believe it was Colby who said that  the environment and the elements were the dominant factors in this  competition. Would any of you quibble with that? <br/>Elisabeth: No, not at all. <br/>Alicia: No. <br/>Jerri: No. <br/>Gumbel: Was the... was the two able to translate how tough  it was out there, Jeff? <br/>Jeff V.: Um, well, I can't speak for how it was after I  left, but... [ laughing] And it seemed to get a lot harder after I left. <br/>Gumbel: Yeah. <br/>Jeff V.: I mean, for us, we were fortunate at Kucha to be  kicking Ogakor's butt, so we had lots of food. <br/>Gumbel: Can we... can we explain what the names for the  tribes were when you were out there? <br/>Jeff V.: Um, Kucha is, uh, kangaroo, and Ogakor...  Gumbel: No, no, no, no, no. What did you call 'em? <br/>Oh...  Jeff V.: Oh, you mean in the dressing room? <br/>Gumbel: Yeah. <br/>Jeff V.: Oga-boring. <br/>Oh! <br/>Gumbel: Oga-boring. <br/>Keith: Hey, Jeff, the game's over, man. The game is over, Jeff. Still drawing the line. [ laughter]  Gumbel: How bad was the hunger, Nick? <br/>Nick: You know, I never ever felt hungry after day one,  but you're just weak. You get up to do anything, and you're weak, and you get dizzy. And the day I got kicked off, I stood up and just got dizzy and  couldn't do anything. And that never really translates on the television, but...  Jerri: They weren't as hungry as we were. <br/>Nick: We weren't as hungry as them, 'cause we were kicking  their butt. <br/>Jerri: That's the issue. Kucha never experienced hunger the way that Ogakor had to. <br/>I agree. <br/>Jerri: And they didn't experience it-- for the people that  stayed till the end-- until after I left-- at that point, when there was a-a  cup of rice left. And I watched Elisabeth start going through the same things that  we had gone through at the beginning of the game. I watched Nick experience it, and... I thought it was kind of  funny, but, uh... sweet justice. [ laughter]  Gumbel: Cruella DeVil had nothing on you, darling. Yes, yes, Mad Dog? <br/>Maralyn: Bryant, um, after a couple days, my stomach was  shrinking. Uh, I was losing weight, feeling good. If only I could've stayed there for a couple more weeks, I'd be  wearing a thong. [ cheering]  Gumbel: Mitchell, Mitchell, correct me if I'm wrong, but  you were among a few people here who kind of thought that, when the cameras  were off, the crew would... would feed you, right? <br/>Mitchell: Right, right. Throw you an apple or something. <br/>Gumbel: I mean, you would've thought they'd flip you an  apple or a banana or something? <br/>Mitchell: At least that, right? Especially for me. Look at me. I'm seven feet tall. I weigh, like, a buck ten. So I think it definitely hit me faster than it hit anybody else,  and-and I know that that was probably the reason of my exit. [ laughter]  Gumbel: Rodger, was that the worst part of it? <br/>Rodger: Oh, yes, sir. We went one, uh, stretch out there for about 34 hours without  anything to eat, and-and then when we did eat, it was, like, a, uh, third,  uh, of a cup of rice. And I remember Thanksgiving Day, uh, Day, Nick had been keeping  a-a calendar, and all we had to eat Thanksgiving Day was some, uh, uh,  macadamia nuts. So that'll-that'll be a Thanksgiving I'll-I'll never forget. <br/>Gumbel: Yeah. Boredom was... boredom was a part of it. Um, lack of companionship, shall we say, um, was another part of  it. Kimmi, I had heard a rumor... I had heard a rumor-- you can  just... you can confirm or deny-- that, um, you were going to do a birthday  suit bash. <br/>Kimmi: Yes, I said I would. I said I was going to, in Survivor tradition, you know, go out  and, um, go in my birthday suit on my birthday, and you guys voted me out  four days too soon. Thanks a lot. <br/>Elisabeth: That was strategy, Kimmi. <br/>America's loss. <br/>Jeff V.: We saw it anyway, Bryant. <br/>Gumbel: Oh, I'm sorry? <br/>Jeff V.: We saw it anyway. <br/>Kimmi: Oh, my God! Oh, my God. <br/>Gumbel: Jeff, you know, you're the one who had asked ahead  of time, I heard, "If somebody has sex out there, are you going to tape  it?"  Jeff V.: How did you hear this? <br/>Gumbel: I asked around. <br/>Jeff V.: Yeah. <br/>Gumbel: Um, no-nobody did. <br/>Jeff: Yes. <br/>Gumbel: Nobody even tried. How come? <br/>Jeff V.: Well, I mean, I don't... You know, everybody  says, "Who had sex with whom-- where's the romance?" but to me, I  mean, for the life of me, I cannot imagine anybody in that environment being  romantically attracted to anybody. <br/>Gumbel: Why? <br/>Jeff V.: You're not eating...  Gumbel: Why? The rest of us are looking at this and saying, "This is the  Baywatchbunch."  Jeff V.: Well, you'll be out there with people that are  not bathing, are not brushing their teeth, are getting on your nerves,  sleeping in dirt. <br/>Armpits...  Jeff V.: There's nothing sexy about that at all. <br/>It didn't bother me a bit. <br/>Kimmi: No Tic-Tacs, no square of toilet paper...  Been wearing the same undies for...  Kimmi: You can't touch yourself, let alone somebody else. <br/>Gumbel: Is that why, Nick, you said all these women looked  so nasty? [ laughter]  Alicia: Did you say that? <br/>Maralyn: Bryant? <br/>Gumbel: He did. <br/>Nick: After-after 24 hours... I mean, we have some cute  women in this game and on my tribe. <br/>Jeff V.: Beautiful. <br/>Nick: And after 24 hours, they're nasty, and I mean... [  laughter] I mean, so what? I was nasty, too. I mean, three pairs of underwear. Three pairs of underwear. You're all nasty. <br/>Gumbel: Go ahead, Mad Dog. <br/>Maralyn: Bryant, as you know, I am a retired cop, so from  day one, I designated myself as the prophylactic police. [ laughter] There were 12 condoms in that first aid kit when I  got there, and by God, there were 12 when I left. [ laughter]  Whoo! <br/>Gumbel: But I mean, the rest of us are sitting at home,  and we're watching these lovely young ladies-- which reminds me, which  reminds me... Amber, Elisabeth, having watched the first one and seeing all  the attention that Colleen and Jenna got for those bikinis, what was the deal  with those bathing suits? <br/>Amber: Strategy. No. [ laughter]  Jerri: That's my line. <br/>Gumbel: Strategy or modesty? <br/>Amber: No, I mean, I was just thinking, you know...  Nick: We wanted the thong. <br/>Amber: The thong, yeah. Well, I wanted... if I'm going to do challenges in these bathing  suits and swimming in these bathing suits, I didn't want my top falling down  anywhere, and also, you know, you had to go with the shorts thing, and she  had the same idea. <br/>Gumbel: Elisabeth? <br/>Elisabeth: You needed the shorts. You feel a little more comfortable, and I thought bright, in  case, um, something drastic would happen, someone could definitely find me in  the pink. [ laughter]  Gumbel: All right. We'll let it go at that. Hey, look, as I promised, we'll talk, uh, friends and enemies  when we come back in just a little bit, but before we do, Colby, a special  treat for you. Some folks in, uh, your hometown of Dallas are celebrating with  a huge party tonight. Here's a live look at how some of the Lone Star state are  saluting their star Survivor. We're back after this. [ cheering]  Maralyn: Oh, God, seven weeks in a dumpster! If you can survive seven weeks in a dumpster, you can do seven  weeks in the Outback standing on your head. [ applause]  Gumbel: You know, we know the answer to who was that  mystery woman, but let's take a look at the monitors. Who is this mystery woman? [ whooping] Hello, Mama. Hello. <br/>Tina: Bow-wow. <br/>Gumbel: Twice the weight now, aren't you? <br/>Maralyn: Yes, I am, Bryant. <br/>Gumbel: Hey, look, um, Keith alluded to it earlier. There are some relationships here that have been formed that are  going to last for a long time. Uh, a lot of you wanted to be a part of this reunion, but Debb,  you had some hesitations, didn't you? You weren't sure you wanted to be a part of this reunion. How come? <br/>Debb: I-I knew I didn't want to be a part of it. <br/>Gumbel: How come? <br/>Debb: Well... I guess nobody really got a chance to know  me, and then... and then, I got home... and the press pretty much tore me  apart. It hasn't been fun. <br/>Gumbel: Would you do it again? <br/>Debb: No way. <br/>Gumbel: Bad trade: three days in the Outback for your life  being exposed? <br/>Debb: Bad trade, bad trade, but... you can't look back. I mean, it's a done deal. You've just got to move forward. It's just, uh... I guess the hard part is I'm strong. I'm a very strong, independent person, care about people a lot, and...  I seem to have, uh... lost my belief in myself. You know, but I-I will get it back. I will. <br/>Gumbel: You already got it back. <br/>Debb, we love you. <br/>Gumbel: Captain Kel, what  Debb, we love you. <br/>Gumbel: Captain Kel, what about you? Um, I saw where you said you will never-- accent on the never--  forgive Jerri for what she did. Why not? Isn't life a little too short for that? <br/>Kel: I have forgiven Jerri. I have... but I don't like her. [ laughter] [ cheering] She'll never... well, she'll never get a  Christmas card from me. Never. <br/>Gumbel: Um, I guess it's your turn, Jerri. <br/>Jerri: Well, I mean, I don't ever expect in my life to  have everyone like me, but...  Gumbel: There's a good bet. [ laughter]  Jerri: We're going to have breakfast again. <br/>Gumbel: Yeah, I know, I know. <br/>Jerri: No, I-I really don't. And I... you know, the things that happened out there are... are  so separate from... our lives now, and... and I think for some people, maybe  it's easier... to tell the difference. And... you know, I... I feel... I feel bad, Kel, I do, that-that  you harbor resentment and hatred towards me. <br/>Kel: But you know, Jerri, this is the first time you've  ever spoken to me. This is the first time...  Jerri: That's what today is for, for me. I-I hope that that's kind of what it's been for everyone, the  same way. I've been talking to a lot of people. <br/>Kel: Like I've said, I've forgiven you. You're just not going to get Christmas cards from me. [ laughter]  Gumbel: Um, let's move on. Alicia, you send a Chris... you send a Christmas card to Kimmi? Come on, now, we had the...  Alicia: No. <br/>Gumbel: We had the head bob, the head bob, and the finger  point and everything else. Um, did you send a Christmas card? <br/>Alicia: I'm famous for that finger wave, man. <br/>Gumbel: Well, you know, there's a couple of people who saw  it. <br/>Alicia: Just a few. <br/>Gumbel: Take a look. We'll refresh everyone's memory. Roll the tape, Al. <br/>Whoa! <br/>Colby: Here we go again. <br/>Kimmi: That's all I was saying. It's a good thing just to break it up. Especially...  Alicia: But you are the defensive one about the chickens,  not me, so do not yell at me about the... You can get as emotionally attached  if you want, because the only reason why we said it is 'cause we care about  your feelings. You're part of this tribe. But don't jump all over me, sweetheart. <br/>Kimmi: Don't wave your finger my face. <br/>Alicia: I'll wave my finger in your face. You want me to say it in your face? I'd be happy to. I'm saying it to your face right now. <br/>Kimmi: Thank you. <br/>Alicia: I'm tired of your ... chicken. <br/>Gumbel: In this corner...  Alicia: Whoo, yeah. <br/>Gumbel: Well, wait a second now. She called you. <br/>Alicia: Yeah, she did. <br/>Gumbel: Why didn't you call her back? <br/>Alicia: Because, out of everything that's happened to me  on this... in this game, on this show, with all of these people, that's the  one really negative thing. And at that time, and-and what I was doing at that point, I was  not ready to confront that. I didn't want to confront the negative thing. I was having too much fun with all the positive things, and, uh,  so I didn't call her back. <br/>Gumbel: And now? <br/>Alicia: It's all good. [ laughter] Kimmi and I... like Kel said-- she's not going to  get a Christmas card from me. We're never going to be, like, best buddies. I mean, we wouldn't have gotten along no matter where we were,  but you know what? These 16 people are so incredibly amazing, and for me to not  hold close to my heart everything that I've been through, including-- got to  love you, Kimmi-- including that whole episode with Kimmi-- I mean, I can't  walk away with this harboring ill feelings toward anybody or anything,  so...  Gumbel: Well, that's good. We like that. Amber, you said that you were good at hiding the fact that you  got annoyed easily. Why'd you hide it? <br/>Amber: Because... I didn't want to make it obvious to  anybody, 'cause then they might hold a grudge against me and vote me out  earlier, you know? Why would you want to show somebody that you're annoyed with  them? You want... you want them to think that you like them. <br/>Gumbel: Jerri would say that's just being honest. <br/>Jerri: Yep. And that's, for me, that's what I found to be the way to keep my  sanity in that situation: was to express it and get it out. And I guess I just... I expected it, as well, for other people  to do the same to me. If somebody was irritated with me, I would've been perfectly  fine with them bringing it up in my face, getting it out on the table and  clearing it up. <br/>Kimmi: Jerri, you saw what happened, didn't you? We tried that. We tried that. <br/>Gumbel: Rodger went the opposite route. Rodger, I-I believe I read that you said you went in there, uh,  attempting to not be mean, but be straightforward and couldn't bring yourself  to do it. <br/>Rodger: Well, I think I was pretty straightforward. I went in there with the intentions of trying to play the game,  and, uh, that's the reason I've got a lot of respect for these two people  that were in the finals here tonight. They were able to do something that I wasn't able to do, and  that is actually play the game. And, uh, I don't know that that's really such a bad thing in-in  the, uh, the long run. And, uh, I was satisfied with the... with the-the place that I  finished. And, uh, when I got off the plane, first thing I told my wife--  I said, "I didn't do anything out there that I was ashamed of,"  so...  Gumbel: That's nice to hear. And Keith, I can't let... [ applause]  Gumbel: All right, we'll take a break. When we come back, we're going to consider how the Outback  changed everyone and the life lessons learned, but first, we'll take a look  at what's happening tonight in Miami. [ cheering]  Colby: And in college, I even got on a bull or two. <br/>Come on, Colby. [ applause and shouting]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! <br/>Colby: Whoo! [ man shouts] [ audience applauding]  Gumbel: Way to go, cowboy. <br/>Colby: Thank you. <br/>Gumbel: That wasn't your first rodeo, I take it. <br/>Colby: No. <br/>Gumbel: No? <br/>Colby: No, sir. <br/>Gumbel: Uh, look, um, I've been asking a lot of questions,  but some of the good folks who are sitting out here have some. And so, we'll ask this gentleman to voice our first question  from the audience. Yes, sir? <br/>This is for Rodger. How did you get the nerve to jump off that cliff into that  water? <br/>Debb: That was a good move. <br/>Rodger: Well, that... I definitely was not going to let my  other tribe members down, and for me personally, that was probably the  hardest thing that I've ever had to do in my lifetime. I can't swim. <br/>TRIBE MEMBERS: Come on, Rodger! <br/>Nick: The other thing was you didn't see that we actually  pushed him. [ laughter]  Gumbel: Yes, another question over here. Yes, ma'am? <br/>Yeah, my question is for Elisabeth. As a fellow Rhode Islander, um, there's some pretty scary and  amazing wildlife out there. What was your most memorable or maybe scariest encounter? <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, gosh, uh... I guess my... my most scary  encounter every day kind of happened at night when you'd have to use the  latrine. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Elisabeth: And I'm not going to play tough. I was scared to death because you know what it is? It's your imagination out there that gets you because you know  they are. You see them during the day-- you see a snake, you see a croc,  you see everything out there. And when it's your time to be alone with the dark, that's when I  got scared, 'cause every noise, you're, like... you think the worst. So, I guess that would be it in my most honest moment. <br/>Jeff V.: Bryant, I would escort her to the bathroom every  night, and I would, like... Alicia would go with us. <br/>Elisabeth: Buddy system, absolutely. <br/>Jeff V.: And I'd-I'd pinch them on the leg at the bottom  and I'd scare them intentionally. <br/>Alicia: He was the worst, the worst. <br/>Elisabeth: Did you hear that? <br/>Kel: And Bryant, my most scariest encounter has got to be  Jerri. It's got to be, got to be... [ Survivors groaning]  Gumbel: You know, you know... I don't... I'm not... I'm  not going to belabor the hygiene thing, but can I get a count? How many toothbrushes were out there? <br/>ALL: One. <br/>Nick: One after two weeks. <br/>Amber: After they won it. <br/>Kimmi: On day 14. <br/>Jerri: Zero for us at Ogakor. <br/>Colby: It had no bristles after two days. <br/>Jerri: Zero. <br/>Elisabeth: No bristles. <br/>Gumbel: Oh, really? <br/>Keith: After Kucha got done with it. <br/>Elisabeth: We snacked on the bristles. <br/>Gumbel: So what did we do, brush our teeth with sand or  just don't-don't...? [ all talking at once]  Elisabeth: You kind of get your shirt...  Alicia: And you scrub your teeth. <br/>Amber: Yeah, you wipe off the plaque. <br/>Jerri: The plaque wipe, the daily plaque wipe. <br/>Gumbel: Nice, nice. <br/>Kimmi: The nice pine trees. <br/>Nick: This is why people were nasty. <br/>Kimmi: We didn't have any good one, so we'd cut pine  needles. <br/>Nick: This was why there was no... this is why there was  no. [ all talking at once]  Alicia: Can we get back to the nasty thing for a anyone? Nick wants to say Elisabeth and I were so nasty, but Nick kissed  me right on the lips. <br/>Elisabeth: Yes, he did. <br/>Alicia: Hello. Did you not? <br/>Nick: There's a long story to that, but yes. <br/>Alicia: Right on the lips. <br/>Gumbel: Can you say it in less than 30 seconds? <br/>Nick: Right after the first time we brushed our  teeth...  Kimmi: Yeah, that's true. <br/>Nick: ...Alicia was, like, "I'm so clean, I'm so  fresh, who wants to kiss me?" I said... phew... and laid one on her,  just like...  Elisabeth: He did! <br/>Gumbel: Hello! Jerri, why didn't you try that? <br/>Nick: They didn't have a...  Jerri: We didn't have a toothbrush. <br/>Alicia: Yeah, they didn't...  Jerri: We were doing the plaque rub. I would have kissed him, anyway. <br/>Gumbel: I know. She kissed you. Jerri: Not for lack of trying. <br/>Gumbel: We thought something was wrong with you. You said there was no distractions out there. How could you say there was no distractions with these ladies  sitting here? <br/>Colby: Oh, it was... no. It was distracting. <br/>Gumbel: Oh, okay. <br/>Colby: Early on more so than later in the game. <br/>Gumbel: Oh! <br/>Colby: No, I mean just because I finally just determined  it was time to get focused. <br/>Gumbel: Gotcha. [ laughter] I'm not going to pursue it. <br/>Colby: Hey! <br/>GUMBEL [ chuckling]: Yes, ma'am? <br/>First of all, on behalf of Reebok, congratulations, Tina. My question is for Michael. Michael, when you hunted and killed the boar, why did you put  the blood around your eyes? <br/>Alicia: Yeah, Michael, why? <br/>Kimmi: Psycho! <br/>Alicia: We're all wondering that. Tell us all; we want to know why you did that. <br/>Michael: You know, it is on the actual tape, but when I  said it, everyone forget about it once I did that. But I didn't want to tell the other tribe that even catching a  boar was possible. They kept saying, "We've got to tell the other tribe, we've  gotta get the advantage." And I kept saying no, but I got outvoted six  to one. So, I said fine, if we're going to tell them, this is how we  should go to the next challenge. And I put the blood on my face as a kind of a joke, saying  instead of wearing the war paint that we sometimes wore, we would go to the  next challenge wearing the pig's blood, and that would be the way we would  tell them. <br/>Kimmi: Yeah, I was gonna do that! <br/>Michael: It was just meant to be with a joke, for Kimmi,  for Kimmi. <br/>Alicia: He's a little nutty, this guy. <br/>Gumbel: Yeah. Let me, um... Debb has already said she wouldn't do it again. Mitchell, what about you? I mean, weren't you overmatched? Is that fair to do say? <br/>Mitchell: I wouldn't do it... I can put myself back in  those shoes, and I can realize how much I suffered. I could never go through it again. Honestly, for me, um, every day I kept thinking, "When,  when am I going to be leaving?" you know? And as I made that final walk to Tribal Council, I had no idea I  was leaving, and it was a huge shock to me but a welcome one at that point. Yeah, and I'd also like to say that, afterwards, I was able to  travel with Debb. And I really got to know the Debb that nobody else did and found  that she's a wonderful and amazing woman, definitely. <br/>Debb: Thank you. <br/>Mitchell: You are. [ applause]  Gumbel: As Mad Dog has so often reminded us, this was a  g-a-m-e, after all. Um, but as some of you have noted, it is pretty lifechanging,  too. Um, Keith, you...  Maralyn: Bryant? <br/>Gumbel: Go ahead. <br/>Maralyn: I've already gone through the change of life. [ laughter and applause]  Gumbel: Forgive us if we don't pursue that, all right? Keith, you talked about it being a cleansing experience. Cleansed of what? How so? <br/>Keith: Well, first, I have to say that Jerri and I are in  counseling. [ laughing] We're working out those issues. You know, I'm now 41 years old. And I'm divorced, have two wonderful children, and I've had  failures and I've had, you know, successes and stuff. And the last few days for me really enabled me to just reflect. I mean, how many times in your life do you really have an  opportunity to sit and do nothing but think-- with no sounds, no one to talk  to you or nothing. And those last few days, it was very... a lot of solitude. Especially me, I went up top of this big hill and I just hung  out up there and watched the eagles fly. It was a big deal for me. It gave me an opportunity to see... say I'm sorry for a lot of  things to myself and say let's do some things better. So, for me, the game kind of stopped at that point. I was on to a whole new game, all about life. [ applause]  Gumbel: We're going to take a break right here and come  back and do some more business. We'll also let in you on the secret of the next Survivor, when  the reunion continues. But also a quick hand for our live band over here, with David  Hudson on the didgeridoo. [ band playingSurvivor theme] [ chanting]  Alicia: Shh! Shh! Shh! I think I hear something. I got him. I got him. [ thud] Whoo! I got him. I got him. I told you. [ Gumbel laughs] [ applause]  Alicia: That 'roo is up there. That kangaroo is up there in the audience. <br/>Jeff V.: That kangaroo is up there. <br/>Gumbel: That kangaroo is in the audience? <br/>Alicia: That kangaroo is sitting right there in the blue  shirt. Stand up, Peter. Good jumping, babe, good hopping. [ laughter and applause] My kangaroo! <br/>Gumbel: Hey, look, the mud is barely dry on the shoes of  these castaways. In fact I'm not sure the sweat is. But plans are already underway for the next Survivorchallenge  coming this fall. And if you thought snakes and crocs were intimidating, wait till  you see what's waiting for the next 16 Survivors, deep in the heart of  Africa. Jeff Probst has a preview. [ drumbeat, chanting]  Jeff: It is the cradle of civilization, the birthplace of  humanity. This is Africa, and soon 16 strangers will embark on the  greatest adventure of their lives. They will voluntarily be stranded in this land of stunning  beauty, incredible vistas and breathtaking scenery. But don't be fooled. It is also a land of inherent dangers filled with exotic and  deadly animals. But it is not impossible to thrive out here. The Masai have survived for centuries by simply learning to  adapt to their environment. By becoming one with the land, they have learned to live in one  of the most hostile settings on Earth. How will these 16 new Survivors fare in this dangerous  wilderness, and more importantly, how will they survive each other? [ growls] The continent may have changed, but the game is still  the same: outwit, outplay, outlast until only one remains and emerges as the  sole Survivor. [ cheers and applause]  Alicia: That's gonna be good. I wanna go! <br/>Gumbel: That African adventure begins this fall. And your advice to those people going to Africa, Colby, would  be...? <br/>Colby: Expect the absolute worst. <br/>Gumbel: Really? <br/>Colby: Honestly, yeah. You're going to be really shocked if you don't. <br/>Nick: It's not...  Gumbel: Good advice. <br/>Nick: It's not fun. <br/>Gumbel: Let me ask a question. We've now gone about, oh, 53 minutes into this program, and we  haven't made any comparisons between your group and the prior group,  intentionally. But one thing did strike me. The first group had a series of philosophical discussions about  religion, about children out of wedlock, about sexual orientation, about  family, a variety of subjects. Your group never did. <br/>AMBER AND Jerri: Yeah, we did. <br/>Gumbel: At least we never saw it...  Elisabeth: We did. <br/>ALL: You didn't see it. <br/>Gumbel: Ah...  Michael: There was just too much other stuff going around. <br/>Jerri: One of the many moments that didn't make the show. <br/>Elisabeth: No, I can honestly say, as well, we had  discussions but they weren't for the sake of having them either. Like, when we had them, they just... they just happened. And if they were caught, they were caught. And if they weren't, they weren't, but...  Gumbel: Spirited discussions? <br/>Elisabeth: Yes. <br/>Gumbel: Oh. <br/>Debb: Kucha had a two-hour spirited discussion on farting  my first night. [ laughing]  Elisabeth: We did! <br/>Gumbel: I-I don't think we can say that. I think we have to say "bilabial fricative..." on  television. <br/>Elisabeth: That sounds disgusting. <br/>Gumbel: Thank you. <br/>Alicia: Yeah, that sounds worse. <br/>Michael: Hey, Bryant, you focused a lot on a lot of the  negative and fighting relationships that went on, but some of the  relationships that were formed as a result of the show... I mean, I never  knew Keith Famie from Detroit, and I never even met him out in the Outback,  and I never met Tina out there, and those are two of the best friends that I  have from this show, it's just... The bond that we created as a part of this  show... I mean, there was a couple of isolated fights that went on, but I  mean, everybody...  Gumbel: We know Rodger and Elisabeth...  Michael: Everybody here. <br/>Gumbel: ...formed a bond. <br/>Michael: Look at these two. <br/>Gumbel: Jeff and Alicia...  Alicia: Jeff and I are inseparable. <br/>Gumbel: ...are virtually inseparable. <br/>Alicia: We're inseparable. <br/>Gumbel: Kel and Jerri, um... [ laughing]  Kel: Wait...  Gumbel: And Tina, you were going to tell me... you told me  during the commercial you had a quick story to tell about Mr. Varner back here. <br/>Tina: Yes, I do. I started out really thinking he was a player, you know. He was a sweet guy who brought this coloring book to give to  charity, and he was this really compassionate guy. I later found out the night that we voted him off at Tribal  Council, he suspected he was going to go. Well, we had caught 13 fish that day. We were all going to get a fish of our very own. <br/>Alicia: That's... What?! <br/>Tina: We had the fish, we did not get a chance to cook  them. So we put them on a stringer in the water. We came back that night starving, going to eat our fish. They were gone, and we said, "The crocs or the alligators  have eaten our fish." Jeff! [ everyone talking at once] [ audience applauding]  Amber: Did you know that? <br/>Elisabeth: Jeff! <br/>Amber: Eww! <br/>Tina: Evil! Evil! <br/>Rodger: You dog, you. <br/>Gumbel: Hey, look, as we head to commercial break, what  did you do on your vacation? Show us, Mad Dog. Show us what you learned. <br/>Colby: Hit it. <br/>Jeff V.: Break it on down, mama. [ blowing didgeridoo]  Mitchell: Yeah! [ applause and cheering]  All right. [ audience whooping]  Gumbel: We're going to take a break right here. But as-as we head to commercial, Elisabeth, here's something  you'll want to see. Take a look at what's happening tonight in your hometown of  Boston, where a big Survivor party is underway celebrating the achievement of  one of Boston's own. <br/>Elisabeth: Basically, for quite some time now, all I can  think about in the car is being a Survivor, and there are a couple of things  that I think decisions can be made on. Not potholes. [ applause]  Gumbel: We've only got about 30 seconds left. Um, Tina, you had the first word, you get the last one. Um, just answer us one thing: we saw the sweet motherly Tina out  there, and we saw the one who was described as, by someone in this crowd as  "ruthless." Which is the real Tina? <br/>Tina: In the middle. A little of both. You've got to have a good balance in life. <br/>Gumbel: And that's what got you the million? <br/>Tina: Uh... a lot of luck, a lot of luck got a million. <br/>Gumbel: Congratulations. <br/>Tina: Thank you so much. [ applause and cheering]  Gumbel: Tonight was the first time in a long time that  these 16 Survivors have all been together, but it won't be the last. They'll be joining me tomorrow on The Early Showwhere, among  other things, we'll present Tina with her million-dollar check for becoming  the one Survivor who managed to outwit, outplay and outlast in the Outback. Exactly why the actions of all these people have captivated so  many remains a point of debate, a mystery perhaps better left to  psychologists. We only know they've played a game amid the worst of elements  with millions watching and millions judging their character. That they've emerged with as much dignity as they have is no  small feat. On behalf of these 16 now familiar people, thank you very much  for being a part of this reunion. In every way, the tribe has spoken. I'm Bryant Gumbel. Good night. [ applause and cheering]
