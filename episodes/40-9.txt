<br/>[crickets  chirping] Tony: Well, good news is that there's stars out tonight. -Adam: Yeah, and a  lot. -so, sky's clear. Michele: I’m really,  really annoyed. I hate getting  blindsided, to be perfectly honest. And the fact is is  that I wanted Wendell out. I wanted him out since  the beginning. I've told these people  that I was on board with that, and yet here we are, me blindsided, on the  wrong side of the votes again. I feel like dã     jã  vu from day two. Nick: I do, too. These people are all,  like, bumbling, fumbling idiots. I can't stand them. I don't... -i can't  either. -i-i am over... Nobody  will say a name. I'm over it. Do you think that they  want me next? Your name was on the  block today. -it was? -it was between you  and Adam. It could've-- it was probably  all a facade. Every single person  probably knew -except us. -yeah. I think I’m just gonna  let 'em have it. -don't even do that. Don't... -i'm next  anyways. -what's it matter? -no, you're not. No, you're not. Don't sink your own  game. Nick: I feel like Wendell  was kind of the first shot. This is ruthless and  cutthroat, and... There's gonna be bloodshed. And I’m gonna like it. I'm-i'm gonna get on  that train now, to where I love blood. -Tony: Nick, you all  right? -it is what it is, you  know? -yeah, yeah. -i'm the only person  that didn't know, man. -what am I supposed to  think? -Michele: I didn't  know. -Tony: Michele didn't  know either, but... -well, Michele, but... But you-you know-- you know-- sit  down, man. Nick, come on. You know how to play  the game, man. You can't-- you can't  act like that. Nobody's coming after  you because we got rid of Wendell. -all's fair... -no,  but everybody's coming after me always. -always. Every vote. -no. No. Nick: I feel like it  is now my duty to take every one of these people out that have double-crossed  me. I'm ready for some  revenge. Michele: I’m okay. I'm a little pissed,  but I’m okay. Adam: Oh, man. Tribal council  tonight, my heart was beating sofast. [chuckles]: Literally,  like, out of my chest. It was outrageous. I was so incredibly  nervous. But I’m here. I'm here. I'll smile to their  face. I'll tell them it's  all kumbaya. Meanwhile, I think  they're all dingbats. Adam: Right now, Michele  is feeling incredibly low. But I see it as an  opportunity. I'm not telling a  single other solitary person. The little thing--  there's a little thing at-- a little sword. Mm-hmm. -a little thing like  this. -mm-hmm. ...but i'm-- I feel  very confident that it is. I think that there may  be an idol in Jeff probst's podium. I recognize the  fleur-de-lis symbol from the idol that Denise found, so the fact that there  is a fleur-de-lis right in front of us at tribal council makes me think that  that might actually be a live idol. In the chance that I’m  right, it'd be a pretty epic way to save myself. Yul: Whoa. What do we have here? "open when  everyone is present." anyone order pizza? -yes! -yeah! -kind of small for a  pizza box, -but... -Parvati: Is there a token in there? -i don't know. It's... -cool. Wendell. -Wendell: Thank you,  sir. -rob: What does it  say, Yul? Ethan: History? -so, basically, this  means... -there's something on top of the mountain. Parvati: When there's  something hidden somewhere. Amber: There's  something hidden somewhere. So, we got a clue that  said something about history repeats itself. So we're all thinking,  "oh, it's all the past clues that we've been given while we're here on  the edge." it's maybe the combination boxes, you know, maybe it's the  trails. Rob: Yo, yo, we got to  go! The tide! Step back and assess. Amber: Let's step back  and assess once we get up here. Natalie: We could  break off into twos -or threes, too, guys. -yeah. -Natalie: What do you  think? -Ethan: I’m going this  trail -up to the left. -i'll go with you, Ethan. Natalie: Let's break  off. I'll go with the boys. Wendell: I need to  come with somebody. Amber: Yul's got ya. Natalie: You go with Yul. I'll go with Rob. Wendell: All right. Natalie: Once we were  at the top of the mountain, I was like, "let's go split off into  groups," because if we find tokens, I want to spend it to buy food. Wendell just had a  merge feast, so he's good. And Yul just got here. He hasn't been  suffering like the rest of us. And so I just wanted  to make sure that Wendell and Yul are completely left out of this advantage. Did you guys check out  this tree? Danni: "history  repeats itself." would it be something from the last time they had Edge  of Extinction? Parvati: Oh, maybe. Where did they find  it? Aubry found one at the  steps. "step back,  assess, 'cause history will repeat itself." -yep. -'cause that's what  aubry did. That's exactly what it  is, isn't it? -yeah. -let's go. Danni: As a fan, the  wheels started turning, and I thought, "maybe this is something from a  past season on extinction"-- when aubry stepped back and looked up at  the steps and found where the clue was. This is mine. So, it's, like-- see  these little holes here? Oh, got it. I got it, I got it, -i  got it, I got it. -oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Okay, come over here. Yes. Oh, my God! I did something! Survivor-- I’m playing  the game! -here, open the clue. -yes. Parvati: I feel like a  mouse trapped on this mouse experiment. And finding the prize  was, like, my piece of cheese. -oh! -oh! Now you go. Wow. It was, like, a safe  or unsafe coin. And if you flip and it  lands on "safe," you have immunity. That's huge. -okay, what do you  think? -should we sell it to Michele? -she has the most fire  tokens. -and get money -to buy  our food? -yeah, that's what I’m  thinking. -like, should we sell  it for four tokens? -okay. Somebody's coming  down. Oh, here they come. Shh, shh. Parvati: For a moment,  I was thinking we could keep this just between us and then we could have a  jar of peanut butter just for me and Danni. [chuckles] did you  guys find anything? Amber: No! Rob: You guys have it? -Parvati: All right,  let's tell 'em. -okay. Parvati: But then I was  thinking... -rob: They got it. -...i've got people  out here who I trust, and a lot of people have been here way longer than me. So I’m like-- my heart  just can't not want them in on the secret. They could win  immunity. -at tribal council. -but we-we have to  -sell it to someone. -now we have to sell  it to someone in the game. I know that you can  buy peanut butter with fire tokens, and we have six people in our group who  are looking to eat something. calm before the  storm  get ready for the thunder.  Come on in, guys! All right, let's get  to today's reward challenge. For today's challenge,  you'll be divided into two teams of five. On my go, you'll swim  out and retrieve a net filled with wooden fish. You'll untie those  fish, put 'em on a pole, get the pole to the finish, and you will use the  fish to solve a puzzle. First team to finish  wins reward. Want to know what  you're playing for? -of course. -oh, yeah. Probst: A little taste  of home. Chinese takeout. -oh! -[chuckles]: Oh, yeah. -probst: Waiting for  you back at camp. -ooh. We're gonna do a  schoolyard pick. There are 11 of you. Only ten will run. That means one won't. -wow. -war is not pretty. Let's do this. all right, we  have our two teams. Running for red, it is  Tyson, Adam and Tony in the water. And on the puzzle, Nick  and Jeremy, who was the captain. He chose this team. Running for blue, Kim  was the captain. She has Sarah and Ben  with her in the water, and she put Sophie and Michele on the puzzle. Denise was not chosen. No shot at reward. Let's see who chose  the best team. For reward, Survivors  ready? Go! first, it is a  race to your fish. Got to untie that net  and get it back to shore. Tyson first there. Ben is there. Once you have all the  knots, start pulling it back to shore. Ben has one side down. Kim has the other. -blue's good. -go, go, go, go, go. -red's free. They're good. -let's go, guys! Probst: Now comes the  heavy lifting. The net and those  wooden fish weigh a lot. There are 14 of them. -you good? Let's go. -Michele: Good job,  guys! Probst: You got to  drag it all the way back to shore. It is blue out to the  early lead. Tony, Tyson and Adam  trying to stay in it. -clear! -probst: Blue, you're  good. Red, you're good. Now you've got to  untie the fish and put 'em on the hooks. Adam gonna hang for  red. Sarah starts to hook  the fish. Adam hooks another  piece. Tyson has another  piece untied. Blue, you're good. Head out. Blue still in the  lead. Denise: Go! Red down to their last  piece. Got one left. Got to get it on  there. -you're good. Go, red. -Tony: Go! -let's go, let's go,  let's go. -Kim: [grunts] pick it  up. Michele: Go, guys, go,  go, go. Probst: Once you get  it up here, puzzle solvers take over. You're good. You guys are good. You're good, red. -soph, you want to  start? -let's start. It's Michele and Sophie  working on the puzzle for blue. Jeremy and Nick for  red. All these pieces will  fit in flush. You will know when you  have it, and you'll know when it's not right. This is a puzzle that  will come together quickly, and, out of nowhere, you will have it. Nice job. Fit just like this  one. Probst: Two teams  picked by two people, Jeremy and Kim. That's good. -that's good. No. -this one fit  somewhere? Probst: Red thinks  they're getting somewhere close. One piece left to fit. Where does it go? Nick moves another  piece around. Is this the right  combination? -[groans] -that's not  right. Yep. Nick and Jeremy are  gonna swap pieces out now. Sophie liking what  she's seeing over here. Michele trying to put  in another piece. Will it fit? Is it right? Another swap. -[cheering] -and they  have it! -Kim, Sophie, Sarah...  -ben: Good job, girls. -...Michele and Ben  win the war. -good job, girls. Mwah! Yes. Chinese takeout  waiting for you back at camp. I don't know what we  were doing wrong, dude. All right, Sarah, Kim,  Ben, Michele, Sophie, waiting for you back at camp, chinese takeout. -grab your stuff, head  out, enjoy. -Jeff. Can I give up my  reward to someone? -really? -yeah. Sure. -thank you so much. -happy birthday, Nick. -Kim: That's sweet, Sarah. -oh, thank you. -[applause] -Kim: Welcome. Probst: So, Sarah,  you're fighting for $2 million in this game, and you gave this up to Nick  because it's his birthday? I'm giving it up, but  i'd rather see him happy than... Me miserable, 'cause i'll eat too much. So, I hope you feel  miserable. -[chuckling] -i'll do  my best. -Sophie: Good job, Sarah. -probst: All right. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Denise, you can join  'em. Adam: Sarah made a  mistake by switching out with Nick. Look, Sarah came into  this game with quite a reputation. The way she played  game changers, she blindsided friends left and right. So if Sarah's move  puts a bigger target on her back, fine with me. I don't trust her as  far as I can throw her. And I can't throw very  far.  Nick: I’m so  sorry, Sarah. -i will pay you back. -no, no. It's-- -i didn't do it  to be paid back. -i know you didn't. Sarah: I gave Nick my reward  as a human being to human being. There was-- no  gameplay was in it. It was a complete  genuine decision. We're gonna go out  where we ate the merge feast, guys. Sarah: Nick's birthday  was yesterday. Nick got completely  blindsided yesterday. -bye, guys. -Sarah: This game is  very tough. We're all away from  our loved ones. He just got engaged. So I hope it taught  everybody a lesson. Just as a world, we  can be nicer to each other. What did you do, man? What? It's okay. -no, Sarah. -yes. -i'm not-- I’m not scolding  you or preaching to you. -yeah. No. -i'm just giving you  my opinion. -i-i personally think  -it was the right move. -okay. Tony: Wow. Sarah got caught up in  the moment, and that one moment on Survivor is what costs you the game  sometimes, when you can't get out of that emotional, realistic, humane moment  to be that barbaric Survivor that you need to be. You won, you were  happy, and you became human. -you know what I mean? And that's what, you  know... -yeah, I know. And then everybody's  probably saying, -"that was a strategic move on Sarah's part." -no. -"Sarah's playing  a great game." -that's fine. That's fine. "Sarah's got to  go." because I gave up a reward? That's how it happens. Adam: Why were you  help... -of course, of course. -right? Of course, of course. -of course, of course. -yeah. For real. -like, yeah. A horse is a horse, of  course. Jeremy: Sarah gives up  her reward and gives it to Nick, one of the main guys I want to talk to  because he's on the outs. I'm like, "come  on, Sarah." and i've done that before. I've given up reward. And you know what they  did? They voted me out. After that move, what  she just did right there... -yeah. -...i think that's the  move. Ben: Kim, thank you  for picking me. Thank you for picking  me. Ben: Look at this. Nick: Sarah gives me  the reward. And I appreciated it,  but... I don't feel like I owe her anything. I don't trust her any  more than I already did, and it wasn't much, because I know the game Sarah  plays. And if Sarah was told  to write down my name tonight, she would. Kim: You just, like...  Nick: But, hopefully, there are some clues hidden somewhere for a hidden  immunity idol or a steal a vote advantage or something. And hopefully I can  find it. Should we, like, open  all the fortune cookies? -ben: Oh, yeah. -we should. -[Michele chuckles]  -ben: Here we go. -Kim: Well, this is  it. Yeah. Everyone can go  around. "your skill will  accomplish what the force of many others cannot." Nick: Mm. [chuckles] "you  will make changes for the better." [chuckles] Michele: Okay. Aw. Michele: This game has  been such an emotional roller coaster. Last night was a  seriously low point in the game for me. And then, this  morning, I received Wendell's fire token, which puts me at four fire tokens. And I think that makes  me the richest person out here. So, I get back to camp  and I notice something in my bag. So I scurry off and I pull  out...  Dun, dun, dun this beautiful 50/50 coin advantage. [chuckles] okay. Oh, my God. That's all my fire  tokens. This coin is 50/50,  and I truly feel 50/50 on whether or not I should take the advantage. Let's see what  happens. [laughs] I want to see  how many times I can get "safe." "not safe." 50/50. [laughs] living up to  its name. But... At the reward  today, we had fortune cookies. And two of mine were,  "as the purse is emptied, the heart is filled." and the other is,  "don't be afraid of taking that big step." all right, well, since  you're not gonna help, I’m gonna have to do it alone. So now I feel like the  SurvivorGods came down and put these fortunes in my fortune cookie to say,  "Michele, jump on this "and get yourself some God-darn power in  this game ofSurvivor." so I’m gonna trade in my four fire tokens for  this beautiful advantage. Wow. all right, let's  get to today's immunity challenge. First things first, Denise,  Jeremy, got to take back the necklaces. -thank you. -yep. Once again, individual  immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,  you're gonna balance on a triangular platform, with your feet perched on very  narrow footholds. At regular intervals,  we'll move up, making it more difficult. If you fall off,  you're out. Last person left  standing wins immunity, safe from the vote. In addition, earns a  fire token. Losers, tribal  council, where somebody will be the 11th person voted out of Survivor: Winners  at War. Draw for spots. We'll get started. all right. Here we go. For immunity. Everybody put your  feet on that first bottom perch. Try to find a spot for  your toes. Here we go. Everybody stand into  your first position and let go. And this challenge is  on. And already it is  difficult. There's nothing to  hold on to. Very little room for  your toes. We will be in this  spot for five minutes. [grunts] Michele  suddenly just drops, loses her balance. Michele is first out. Swim over. Michele, no shot at  immunity tonight. -ah. -probst: Jeremy with a  nice save. Denise with a nice  recovery. No, Denise can't save  it. Denise is out. We are down to nine. On day 23, there is  nobody that doesn't want immunity. [groans] 15  seconds left in this round. Get through this, you  get to reset. Jeremy with another  nice save. Five seconds left in  this round. Jeremy struggling to  hang on. -you are safe. You can sit down. -[groans] [groaning,  sighing] you have survived round one. -Adam: Oh, my God. -oh, my God. [hisses] -so hard. -[exhales]   probst: All right, everybody move your feet one perch higher now for round  two. It's gonna be a lot  more difficult. All right, I’m gonna  count you in, and you got to be up when we get to one. Five, four, three,  two, one. Everybody let go. And we are back on. We'll be here for ten  minutes. [creaking] Tyson  drops. He's out. -[shouting] -Jeremy  with another nice save. [shouts] that is how  you stay alive in this game. [whimpers] [groaning] Jeremy  can't hang anymore. Jeremy's out, with one  of the craziest dismounts ever. [laughter] that wind's  starting to pick up now. It's already tough  enough out there. -Tony with a wobble. -[exhales] saves it. -[groans] -Tony can't  hang in there anymore. -Tony is out. -Denise: So close. Probst: We're down to  six-- three women and three men. -[exhales] -probst: It  is Sophie, Sarah, Kim, Nick, Adam and Ben. -[grunts] -season  called Winners at War, you have to assume everybody's coming for you. It is a war. Winners at War, hungry  for more  Winners at War  Winners at War, hungry for more  Winners  at War  they're coming for you. Ten seconds left in this section. Five, four, three,  two, one. You are good. Everybody can sit  down. You've made it through  the second section. Good job, guys! [exhales] probst: All  right, everybody move to the top of the triangular platform. You're gonna have both  feet now on the top. Let everybody get  settled. I will count you in,  and we'll be back on. This could go quickly. Adam really struggling  to even get in position to begin this final section of the challenge. All right, Adam. You got to give it a  go. Here we go. Five, four, three,  two, one. -Adam, you're out. -damn it. -[Sophie yelps]  -probst: Sophie is out. Nick is out. We're down to three. It is Sarah, Kim and  Ben. -Sarah's out. We're down to two. -stay. Stay. -stay. -probst: It is Kim and  Ben fighting for immunity. Both now got their  legs. Dig in right here. Let's go! Find it! These are the kind of  showdowns you want on Survivor. Dig, dig, dig, dig,  dig. [Kim mutters] [Ben grunting]  [screams] probst: Ben loses it! -Kim wins individual  immunity! -[applause] safe  tonight at tribal council. -cannot be voted out  of this game. -Michele: Good job,  Ben. That was awesome. -good job, Kim. -wow. -wow. Kim, come on over. -congratulations. -thank you. Safe tonight at tribal  council. Cannot be voted out of  this game. -ah. -oh. -and in addition... -i  do want that. [laughs] -...a fire  token is yours. -thank you. Thanks. -[Michele chuckles]  -probst: Have a seat. Denise: Nice job. As for the rest of  you, after 23 days, somebody voted out tonight, sent to the Edge of  Extinction. Swim out. -see you tonight at  tribal. -yes, sir. Tony: My big concern  from day one was that the lower-profile players, as I would call the hyenas  of the game, will all start coming after the higher-profile players and pick  us off one by one. So right now I want to  try to get rid of the hyenas because they're gonna wait for the lions to go  at it, and then they're gonna come in and clean up shop. Kim: Feels  amazing to have the immunity necklace walking into tribal tonight. -so much respect. -yeah, buddy. -i got lucky. -no. Kim: But really,  tonight's vote is not, like, a huge, crazy vote unless something goes down  and an idol gets played. Do we try and split  the votes? Do we have enough to  split votes? Kim: We have enough,  and it seems that the easy vote would be between Nick and Adam and that we  would split the vote. -we got to find out  how Jeremy's feeling. -okay. Kim: What appears to  be the easy vote tonight would be sticking with this larger group of people,  and then you've kind of got Nick, Adam and Michele that are a bit outcasted  from the group. And I think if that  large group of people were to stick together and vote out one of those,  everybody makes it through the night. What about Nick and Michele? Why not split it  between those two because they were in with Wendell. Yeah. Okay, so make Michele  the backup vote? -ben: Yeah. -okay. Kim: I think Nick's  just not to be trusted, from my perspective. I don't have a  relationship with him. I think he's also a-a  challenge threat moving forward. So Nick would be my  preference tonight. -your name is out  there again. -really? -mm-hmm. -who's putting it out there? I think Sophie. Nick: I’m gonna take  this game over. I'm tired of being  told what to do, and I’m tired of my name getting thrown out as a easy vote. Nick: If there's gonna  be tons of chaos, that's good for me. I want more and more  names thrown around. I want more and more  people to turn on each other. You don't want to do Sophie? I know. I know that. Adam: What do you  think? -yes. -Nick: Sarah gave me  the reward, but she's tighter to a lot of people than she is to me. -Michele: Good luck. -yeah. Yeah. Nick: So I don't feel  bad if I can send Sarah home. -anything new? -um, yeah. So, there's basically  one group saying... Saying the Nick or Michele. Then a different group  that wants to go Sarah. Oh, my God. -would you go Sarah? -wow. -i'm just mind-blown. -i know. -okay. I'm fine with it if  that's the plan. -okay. -okay. -right? They came to me. Adam was the only one  that could convince everybody to go with the Sarah direction. So I’m thinking Adam,  if he has that type of power to be able to control people like that and say--  put his foot down and people listen, we should plop it all on him. We agree to Sarah, but  I think Adam's more dangerous as a player. So I think,  "okay, I have to do something." huh? Are you? -[laughing]: What the  hell is going on? -that's what I think. Tyson: I've never  loved confusion in the game of Survivor. I've always wanted it  to be straightforward. -Adam. -Adam? Adam. He was trying to turn  it all on Sarah. -so... Yeah, so here's  the deal. -what? -we're all voting Adam. -we're all voting Adam. Tyson: But I’m learning  that if you create enough confusion, people start forgetting about you a  little bit. Adam tried to rally  everybody against you, -and Kim told... -against me? Tyson: Shh. Yes. So now we're voting Adam. All of us are. Sarah: Literally, a  bomb went off when my name came out of someone's mouth, and now I’m like,  "hold up." this is not happening. Adam, you threw my  name out. Mistake, brother. You don't throw my  name out, okay? And you're gonna learn  the hard way, and you're gonna learn why you don't throw my name out, because  your ass is gonna go home. -really? -yeah. So... Ben: It's hard  to rope a bunch of winners into a single direction. The group's decision  has changed today. I think the group's  decision will change more times today. I think the group's  decision will probably change at tribal tonight, too. So... I just hope the  target doesn't end up on me tonight. Who said that me and Sarah  were too close? -a lot of people have  said that. -like who? -like, everybody. -like who? -like... -did you say  it? -i-i've been in  part... -you did say that? No, I didn't say it,  but i've been... -i've heard people say it. -who? Ben, it doesn't  matter. -it does matter. -why does it matter? -because people are  telling me it was you. Cool. -no. -ben. Ben, it doesn't  matter. -no, fine. All I needed to know. -that's fine. It does matter. -it doesn't matter. It matters to me,  okay? So, that's all I need  to know. If you don't want to  tell me it, that's your prerogative. I'm glad we had this  conversation. Okay? But if you don't want  -to tell me, that's fine. -you're gonna f...  -force me to tell you. -no, I’m not forcing  you to do anything. You... I just...  That's why I’m walking away. 'Cause I’m not gonna  stay here and, like, try to force you. If you don't want to  tell me, that's fine. -i'll tell. I'll tell. -no. -i'll tell you. -i don't need to know. Adam: Ben talks to me  like I’m a child that needs to be scolded. You know, he plays a  lot more like boston Rob than he would ever want to admit. This is madness. This conversation  pisses me off more than any other conversation i've ever had on Survivor. Then all hell breaks  loose. Have you heard my name  at all yet today? -yes. -really? I've heard so many  plans today. -do you know what I heard,  Tony? -Tony: What? Is that you're the one  that said... -threw my name under the bus. -no! -who told you that? -Michele. What's going on? Same plan. Sarah. -who are we voting  for? -Adam. -who are we doing? -[laughs] huh? Yeah. -Tyson: Yeah. -Sarah? -yeah. Sarah. -okay. I feel like every time  we decide something, I see everybody go off and talk more. Tyson told Sarah it  was her? Yeah. I'm afraid he's going  for me because he keeps telling everybody different .... I wouldn't mind  writing Tyson. She just told me to  write Tyson. They're saying Nick. -huh? -Tyson? -let's do Sarah. -Sarah. -i honestly don't  know. -oh, my God. My plan right now is  to vote Sarah unless these guys are coming up with a new plan at camp as we  speak. So, then that means  that I need to go for what I think might be an idol. I don't even know if  it's anything. I could be completely  wrong. [groans]: Oh, my God. I am imagining myself  watching myself, and I’m going like this. [groans] "he's  playing with so much fire. Please, don't let it  burn him." [laughs]: This is a high stakes game, and I’m playing it on  the edge. I just don't want to  be on the other edge. now bring in the  members of our jury. All right. Sarah, this has been,  thus far, a very cagey game of cat and mouse, where nobody says anything and  then there's another blindside. What did you see  happening today? Um, it's definitely  not cagey anymore. It was chaotic. Everybody's name seems  to appear. People that you're working  with, they're throwing your name out. I mean, it's kind of  like a solo game right now. Tyson, I was gonna go  down the road thinking you guys weren't gonna talk about anything. And Sarah says,  "oh, no, it was the wild, wild west today." Tyson: Yeah. It was a game of  running in circles, meeting back around, meeting in camp, pulling people  aside. -really? -for sure. Jeremy: Jeff, it was  like on one side of the highway, you see a fire. And then the wind  picks it up, whips it across the other side of the highway and explodes. Boom. It was crazy. I played this game  three times, Jeff. I've never seen it  like this today. Probst: Denise, what  was your take? Denise: Jeff, oh, my God. It's like so many  names are getting thrown out, and so you're saying yes to this plan and yes  to that plan and yes to another plan. And you can't keep  them straight. And all I can tell you  is I aged a few years today. Probst: Nick, day 23. Why this tribal does  it break open? I think what's  happened is there are some "easy" votes here. I guess it's me or Tyson  or Adam, and now today, other names come up, and then all of a sudden, all  hell breaks loose. But I’m tired of my  name coming up. I was blindsided last  time. I feel like I’m not  being treated like a player in this game, and I’m ready to join somebody. Make a push. If this is Winners at  War, this is the saddest war i've ever seen. Everybody's afraid to  say anything. Everybody's afraid to  say a name, and everybody's afraid to go after anybody, so... Let's fight. I'm ready. Probst: So, Adam, if  you believe that in this moment in the game, you are an "easy"  vote, that means you have to be in some sort of constant state of assessing  and trying to make sure where the vote's going. What do you do? Adam: Sorry. -yeah. -i'm just trying to  pay attention -to everything that's... -do your thing, man. ...that's going on. [whispering] -no. -okay. I'm good. -everything's good. -i'm good. Let's do it. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. What's going on, man? Whispers at tribal get  attention, Ben. Ben: As they should. It's kind of like what  happened at camp today. Everyone whispered,  and someone heard a name, and then it was like, "oh, heck no!"  there was feuds that were brought up and then extinguished and then brought  up and then extinguished and things that were addressed. And it's still  happening right now as we speak, Jeff. Adam: Look, all I know  is, when we left camp, Ben would not talk to me or look me in the eye, and I’m  concerned... Did I ask you a question? I'm concerned that  maybe you're voting for me. I-i asked him a  question, and he chose not to answer it. And that was on him. And so I turned and  walked away, because a fair and honest question by an alliance member should  be answered. -so I was concerned...  -not if it means having to throw somebody else under the bus. When you were throwing  me under the bus. -i was not. -okay. So, see, Jeff, this is  how this roundabout has gone. Adam: I have had Ben's  back -in this game since the get-go. -i have had your back  -in this game from the get-go. -have you? Have you? -yes. Have you gone home? -why did Wendell vote  for me at the last tribal council? Why did Nick vote for  me at the last tribal council? Is it maybe because  you said I was causing chaos at the Yara camp? That I’m not to be  trusted? You havebeen causing  chaos from day one. Adam: And I still was  not coming after... Ben: You created chaos this whole time. -i speculated that Sarah  might have an idol. -we said that... How  many times have you said sorry? How many times have  you said sorry for... -because you're so sensitive, Ben. -okay, Adam. -[laughter] -Adam: Because...  Because you get angry at me. I'm sorry that I speculated  that she had an idol. I'm playing Survivor,ben. -ben: Okay. Adam. -Adam: And I wanted to  go very, very far in this game with you. -i hear you. -but if I feel like  you're the reason that votes are coming my way... Ben: If you got to tell  yourself that I’m the reason for that, -that's fine. -i stillwasn't coming  after you. -what'd you do at Sele? -Adam: What I did -at Sele  was I told Rob... -rob. ...what was gonna  happen because I was loyal to Rob. Rob said he would  never write my name down. -and you had an  alliance with Jeremy and i, too. -i've explained this  many times. -right? -and have I written  your name down? -and have I ever  caused anybody to write your name down? -and have... Have I written  your name down? -okay. -no, you have not, but  I’m worried that it might happen tonight, and so I’m doing wh-what I think I need  to do maybe -in order to make sure that that doesn't happen. -okay. Are you writing my  name down tonight? No. [sighs] -are you guys  voting for me? -who are you writing  down? Who are youwriting  down? My vote doesn't  matter. -it's all yours that  do. -Jeremy: It does  matter. -it does matter. -Adam: Does it matter? Why? -yes, it matters. -we already talked  about it, man. Adam: Well, then-then  what's all the... Then what's all... Then what's the whispering? Tony: Should we not go  up and vote? Just say it out loud? Adam, what do you want  us to do? That's the game. We got to go up there,  we got to write the name down and then come back down, and then he reads the  votes. [chuckles]: I-i know  that's how it works. But I’m concerned  that-that my name is coming up tonight. Probst: So, Nick,  -that felt like war. -Nick: Yeah, I mean,  now I trust my place better, and I can see where I stand. So, yeah, I feel like  this is better. Adam: I mean, if... If  Nick feels better and he was told to vote for me, I don't feel better. And I’m trying to  figure out is it me, is it him, or is it somebody else? Anybody? Okay. Probst: All right. It is time to vote. Nick, you're up. most chaotic day  ever. I'll go tally the  votes. if anybody has a  hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. damn. Nothing, huh? Not anything? Looked like maybe it  was something. Worth a shot. -[laughs] -what are  you doing? Adam: I don't know. But maybe that was an  idol. I don't know. You're convinced it's  not? Is it? Can I play it? I want to play that. -you want to play  this? -yeah. Can I play that? Probst: This thing  that you can't get -off of the voting podium? -yeah. I... Yeah. I want to play that. Probst: So, if that is  an idol, it would be historic. -yeah. -the first idol ever  hidden at tribal council in plain view of all players, Selected by you and  played for you. Exactly. That is... -...not a  hidden immunity idol. -oh, God. -worth a shot. -probst: That is just  part of the voting podium. -[laughs] -any votes  cast for Adam will still count. First vote: Sarah. Adam. Nick. One vote Adam, one  vote Nick, one vote Sarah. Adam. Nick. Two votes Adam, two  votes Nick, one vote Sarah. Adam. That's three votes Adam,  two votes Nick, one vote Sarah. Adam. That's four votes Adam. Five votes Adam. 11th person voted out  of Survivor: Winners at War: Adam. That's six. That's enough. Need to bring me your  torch. really thought  it might be something. [chuckles] it was  worth a shot. Always. Adam, the tribe has  spoken. Time for you to go. -bye, Adam. See you. -good luck, guys. one too many  mistakes. Damn it. "bequeath your  fire tokens to any player still in the game." i'll give it to Denise. Even if you knew I was  going home. Screw all of you.

This is a crucial  decision. This is going to end  badly. There he is. Welcome to the Edge of  Extinction. -aw, man. -Danni: Welcome to the  edge. -Parvati: Nice try -on  that immunity idol at the end there. -yeah. Adam: I made one too  many mistakes. Three strikes and  you're out in this game, and, uh, the thought that there was an idol at  tribal allowed me to play more aggressively than I should have. And it cost me. [roars]
