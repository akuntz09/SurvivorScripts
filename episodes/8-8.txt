<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor: At a combination  reward/immunity challenge, the stakes were raised. The winning tribe will select one member from the losing tribe  to join them on the reward, which means they avoid Tribal Council. [cheering] Once the challenge got underway, the competition  between Ethan and Boston Rob was red-hot, but Chapera pulled out a narrow  victory. Chapera wins reward and immunity. Chapera chose to kidnap Kathy, saving her from Tribal Council. Chapera, by the way, that's your ride. A 94-foot luxury yacht. While enjoying a day of food and fun, Kathy hit it off with the  rival tribe. <br/>We got a new girl Her name is Kat She fits in just like that. <br/>Probst: At Mogo Mogo, Colby and Ethan agreed to get rid of  Jerri. <br/>I think our decision was made when Jerri Manthey came on  board. I mean, that's the one we want to get rid of. <br/>Probst: But Lex made a bold play. <br/>Their plan is to get rid of you tonight. That's not going to happen. We're going to do Colby tonight. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Lex's gamble paid off, and  Colby was stunned when he became the seventh person to leave Survivor:  All-Stars. 11 all-stars are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION  [thunder rumbling] TELEVISION [thunder rumbling] TELEVISION [thunder  rumbling] TELEVISION [thunder rumbling] TELEVISION [thunder rumbling]  TELEVISION [thunder rumbling] TELEVISION [thunder rumbling] [thunder  crashing]  Is anybody here? Hello? Oh, they're still at the Tribal Council. Just how depressing is this? [groans] It's terrible coming back here. Horrible. It's empty. They're going to come back from Tribal Council. They're going to want to know what's going on. I got automatic immunity. They voted somebody off. I had a ball. [thunder cracks] [grunts] Ah, this is Suvivor at the lowest. I was sipping champagne on the bow of a multimillion-dollar  yacht, and now I am soaking wet trying to save this fire. Oh, my God. [thunder cracks] [rain stops] [indistinct talking]  You have a good time, Kathy? <br/>I couldn't believe I was standing here putting a fire  together and it started to pour. <br/>There, you got it. <br/>The tribe got back and they, you know, didn't give me any  hugs or anything, which is interesting. I got hugged by Chapera in a second, but that's just not this  tribe. <br/>The Tribal Council was brutal tonight. <br/>I bet it was. Heard that Colby got voted out. It was very somber and sad. <br/>His hat, his pants, his canteen. <br/>His hat's not here, is it? <br/>His hat's here. <br/>I really want to send that to him. I hope we can. <br/>We will. <br/>Having Colby gone to me is just, sort of summarizes this  tribe. I don't think this tribe amounted to a whole lot. We were just kind of in the middle, and I think Colby was  actually holding us back because he didn't trust anybody. And it's too late. I think it's too late for this tribe to rally. I will try to think more positive thoughts, but it's difficult  because now Ethan is questioning it all. [thunder booms]  Colby didn't look at anyone when he left. <br/>I'm so surprised. <br/>He didn't even look behind him. <br/>Yeah, just a turn around around and a, you know...  I would have been like, to Jerri after saying all those  things, I would have been, like, "You got me."  That's too bad. <br/>Ooh, don't I feel silly. Wow. The one vote was supposed to be for me and the rest were  supposed to be for Jerri. I thought everything was going smoothly, and boom, you know? Not only was Colby fooled and voted out, but I was fooled and  had no idea. [thunder rumbling] I thought I was pretty close to Lex. Not anymore. Not after Tribal Council. Not after I was left out of those plans. When you feel a bond with someone and they tell you something,  and then they rip that bond apart by doing something totally different, that  hurts. [chuckling] [laughing]  Yes, I feel like I'm being evil right now, but, boy, does  it feel good. <br/>Colby's gone. I mean, what more can I say? I've now officially lived out one of my goals in this game, and  that is to make it longer than Colby. Knock, knock. You hear that sound, Colby? That's the bellboy, and he just took all my baggage away. So... My closet is now clean. My Survivorcloset is clean. <br/>We have tree mail. <br/>All right. Ooh... pretty bottle. <br/>Very pretty. <br/>Oh, my Gosh. <br/>Oh, that's dinner. <br/>"Pick one representative to get on a boat and visit  the Mogo Mogo tribe camp. Bring this message in a bottle with you, open the bottle and  read the note aloud to the Mogo Mogo tribe. Follow the instructions. Bring the pen."  Every single one of us was scared to death. Not one of us wanted to go. We were so afraid that that person might have to stay over  there. So we decided to pull straws, and Jenna ended up picking the  smallest straw. It's Jenna. <br/>You okay? <br/>Yeah. <br/>You sure you're all right? <br/>Yeah. So I just happened to get the shortest straw. I don't think it's a good thing. <br/>All right, sweetheart. Have fun. <br/>Yes. <br/>Have a good time, Jenna. <br/>See if Ethan and my alliance are still tight. [laughing]  There's got be something that when you go over there,  you're on the fence. <br/>I think we should take two things into consideration. Nobody who doesn't want to go should go, and the decision should  be one that everyone finds agreeable. <br/>I think Kathy might be a good representative. <br/>It's up to you guys what you want to do. I don't mind going over, but we definitely had a good rapport  yesterday. I know the players over there. I know they accept me. I know that the hair on the back of neck won't stand up on end if  I get off the boat over on their beach. <br/>Bye, Kath. We love you! Look at that rainbow she's sailing off into. It's a good omen. [indistinct talking]  Hey, welcome to Mogo Mogo. <br/>How are you? <br/>I'm great. <br/>My guess is you have a bottle. <br/>I have a bottle and a pen. [glass shatters] "Dear representative, pick three separate  items from the Mogo Mogo tribe that you feel your tribe would like to play  for in today's reward challenge. You cannot choose anyone's personal items or clothing. Write these items down on the parchment provided in private. Do not let anyone know your choices. Get back on your boat and bring the parchment directly to the  challenge."  So that's how it's going to be. <br/>That's how it's going to be. <br/>Thanks, guys. Hi. I know, it's been so long. <br/>Kathy was chosen to come visit our tribe. What she had to do was make a list of three things to take from  our tribe. <br/>"You cannot choose anyone's personal  items."  If you want to write Tom down, he said...  Aww, he'll go. <br/>Kathy acted like, "I'm just going to take things you  guys don't need. You're not even going to miss them," you know? And we're thinking, "Yeah, right."  What's this, alcohol? [groaning]  And of course we're thinking, "Oh, man, our camp is  amazing, especially our shelter." We have a tarp, we have a parachute,  plus we have blankets, we have pillows. <br/>You guys, all this stuff's going to fine, just so you  know. <br/>We love you. <br/>Whenever I have the opportunity, I'm going to put myself  forward, 'cause inevitably, you know, what really works is networking with  the people. <br/>You're the only one we wanted to see. <br/>I know, it's good to see you guys, too. <br/>Probst: Representatives, come on in. How's it going, Kathy? <br/>It's going well. How 'bout you, Jeff? <br/>Probst: Good. Hey, Jenna. <br/>Hello. <br/>Probst: Bring in the rest of your tribe. Chapera, come on in. Mogo Mogo, come on in. Okay, earlier today you each selected a representative: Kathy  and Jenna. Their job was to go to the other camp and select three items  that they wanted to serve as rewards should their tribe win. They've written down the items they selected. It's a secret. We'll reveal it in a minute. I'll take those from you. First, I'm going to explain the challenge. It is a log roll. One at a time tribe members from each tribe will square off--  man versus man, woman versus woman. First person to hit the water is out. The winner scores a point for their tribe. The first tribe to five wins the reward. See what you're playing for. If Chapera wins, you will take the following items from Mogo Mogo's  camp: grill, one bag of rice and the Hawaiian sling. If Mogo Mogo wins, they will take the following items from  Chapera: one blanket, the parachute siding and your tarp. Because this is man versus man, woman versus woman, Chapera, you  have one extra man so you will sit out one man in this challenge. Who's out? <br/>Big Tom. <br/>Probst: Big Tom's going to sit out. We will randomly draw numbers. Wait for my go. Here we go, first matchup: Shii Ann and Alicia. One foot on the black. Start spinning. <br/>You're going to have to spin somewhere. <br/>You're going to have to spin somewhere, Mama. <br/>We're tap-dancing. <br/>There you go. <br/>There you go, Alicia. <br/>Probst: Alicia's in first. Shii Ann scores one for Mogo Mogo. Mogo Mogo: 1; Chapera: zip. Next matchup: Rupert versus Ethan. Foot in the black. Start spinning. <br/>Come on, Rupert. <br/>Probst: Rupert with his boots. Rupert first in. [cheering] Mogo Mogo: 2; Chapera: 0. Jenna and Kathy... start spinning. Kathy in. Jenna scores for Chapera. <br/>All right. <br/>Probst: 2-1, Mogo Mogo leads. It's Lex versus Boston Rob. Start spinning. Boston Rob working it. Lex reacting. Lex staying on. Lex first in. Boston Rob scores for Chapera. We're tied 2-2. Jerri versus Amber. Start spinning. <br/>Come on, Amber. Better balance. <br/>Probst: Amber looking very confident. <br/>Run, run, run, run, run. <br/>Probst: Up and going. Jerri-- first in. Amber scores for Chapera. <br/>Amber, nicely done. <br/>Probst: Chapera leads 3-2 after the first cycle. We're going to randomly draw new numbers, get new matchups. Here's where we're at: Chapera 3; Mogo Mogo 2. First tribe to five wins reward. Once again, it is Shii Ann and Alicia. Foot in the black. Start spinning. <br/>Come on, Alicia. <br/>Probst: Alicia first in. Shii Ann scores for Mogo Mogo. We're tied 3-3. Ethan versus Boston Rob. <br/>Come on, Rob. <br/>Probst: Best matchup so far. <br/>Wow. [cheering]  Yeah! Yeah! Yes! <br/>Amber, this is you. <br/>Amber, cut me some slack. <br/>Probst: Kathy versus Amber. <br/>Let's go, Amber. <br/>Probst: Here's where things stand: Chapera leads 4-3. If Amber wins, she wins reward for Chapera. <br/>Come on, Amber. <br/>Probst: Foot in the black. Start spinning. <br/>Don't let go. Don't let go. <br/>Probst: Kathy first in. Amber wins reward for Chapera. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: All right, here's how it's going to work: later  today Jenna, since she was the representative, will return to Mogo Mogo and  help herself to the three items. Grill, one bag of rice and the Hawaiian sling. Nice challenge, guys. Head back to camp. <br/>You know, when you think about it, who wouldn't be a  little anxious to be getting a visit by somebody from the opposing tribe to  take some of your most valuable items away. <br/>It'll be so pleasant. We have everything ready for her; she doesn't feel like we're  hostile. <br/>Took a little punch in the jaw, and now, you know, we're  just shaking our... shaking our head with the thought and the prospect of  losing... you know, our fishing spear's a way that we gather food every day,  and, you know, as if that weren't enough, it's a bit of a one-two punch with  the rice as well. <br/>Knock-knock. <br/>Hey. <br/>Hello. <br/>How you doing? <br/>Good. <br/>We have it all set up for you over here. <br/>I have something for you guys. <br/>Oh, what do you have? <br/>Um, we brought you bar soap and toilet paper, and a little  scrub brush to brush your clothes, and a toothbrush. Something to clean you up. <br/>Thank you so much, Jenna. <br/>Here's our grill and our fishing rod for you. <br/>Okay. It's not my fault, and it's not even our fault that we had to  take things from their camp. This is a game, and they know that. So it was nice that I brought something over to them to say,  like, "I'm very sorry that you guys don't have these things, and I have  to take more from you."  We were wondering if you would be kind enough to give us a  couple of scoops of rice from our bag. Because we lost a lot of our rice to mildew in the beginning,  and we've been really rationing for, you know, a rainy day. <br/>Okay. <br/>And...  What do you have exactly? You have one full bag, and...? <br/>One full bag and like a fourth of the other bag. I was wondering if you would be kind enough to give us...  Yes, of course. <br/>...a couple of...  We've been so diligent about rationing our rice, which at  this point, you know... hindsight is 20-20 and you don't know what's going to  happen, but you're almost kicking yourself because we were eating only as  much as we needed to make it last longer and now we just lost, you know, the  lion's share of what we had. <br/>Thank you, Jenna. <br/>No, we're not trying to wipe you out. It was just what we needed, so...  And you got the grade-A rice. <br/>Yes. Thank you so much. The vibe is down. I don't care what they're saying when we come to immunity  challenges, they are down. They know... they're trying to smile, they're trying to be nice,  but they're not happy. They're slowly losing everything they have. They're not happy. <br/>They ain't got a whole hell of a lot over there to get. <br/>We got the biggest stuff they have. <br/>We got everything. We won everything. This whole game, this whole game is about Chapera kicking ass. <br/>I'm going real slow so I don't drop anything. Oh, my tribe was psyched when I came back with the loot. I have rice, and Rupert just never put down that Hawaiian sling. <br/>We're going to sharpen them points down to a... Oh, my  God. I've been waiting 20 days to not have to poke fish with a stick. I'm going to be the hunter tomorrow. I hope I see that big six-foot shark. I hope I see that yellowfin tuna. I hope I see that grouper that's this big. <br/>I know you're excited. <br/>Oh, my gosh, I'm excited. <br/>I'm excited, too. <br/>I've made ten different spears trying to get that damn  thing. <br/>Today is definitely one of the best days for me. The fact that we're getting more rice, eating more, helped out  great in the challenge. And it's just ended up being a really good day. <br/>Right. [laughter] Everybody has gas every now and again. Especially in this situation. You see the abuse? You see that, Jenna? That's grounds for "I'll see ya later."  If Rob and Amber are not playing kissy face, sucky, kissy  face yet, they are going to be soon. Um, I have walked up on them in the middle in the night where  they just looked so guilty it's not even funny, and I know something's going  on. <br/>Later on we'll take a walk, all right? <br/>Definitely at first I was stringing him along. The flirting was a huge strategy in the beginning. Um, but then I got caught up in it, and feelings, you know,  emerged. [laughing, talking indistinctly]  Amber is slammin'. She's sweet, she's beautiful, she's funny, she's got a great  personality. Her ass is smokin', too. <br/>It's crazy because coming into this game I never expected  in a million years for this to ever happen. And actually, I told myself that I wouldn't really let something  like this happen, but... I love having the comfort level of it, and I love...  I love that he, you know, keeps me warm at night and he, you know, makes me  feel safe out here. I can vent to him, complain to him about anything and he won't  hold it against me. You're not ever supposed to feel hold it against me. You're not ever supposed to feel secure in this game, but with  Rob and I, I feel 99.9% secure. <br/>Amber and I have been fooling around a little bit out  here. I mean, it's all in good fun. I'm definitely attracted to her. It'd be nice to have a million dollars and take the girl away,  too. Much better, much better. Good night. <br/>Good night. [thunder roaring]  We might have a rough one today, boys. It's pouring right there. <br/>I'm gonna get fish before it starts storming again. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Rupert's all excited about having the Hawaiian sling. You know, it's his baby. Now he can catch a fish... [imitating Rupert] and show how much  he's worth to the tribe. That's his whole life is that spear. First of all, the guy looks like Grizzly Adams, but he thinks  he's Aqua Man in the ocean. This guy talks baby talk. What is that? You ever notice that? [imitating Rupert] "My name is Rupert. I'm a big and strong fisherman in the Pearl Islands." Now  that we got the spear, we don't need him. [chuckles] I'm not sure that we ever did. And he comes back with a bag of fish feeling all good about  himself. [chuckling]  My God, it took all I had to stop. <br/>Is that the 20-pounder you were talking about? <br/>Uh-huh. [laughing]  I know just as well as anybody else, if you got a Hawaiian  sling, it's like basically going to the pet store and grabbing one of the  goldfish containers and just picking out which fish you want. Wow, look... Rupert. <br/>Hey, I don't think I'll take that spear away. <br/>I'm afraid I'm going to be embarrassed now. [chuckling]  Man, there's a shark that I was looking at like this. I wanted it. [laughs]  ROB [yells]: Yeah! <br/>I'm just glad he caught a fish. <br/>Going back down. <br/>Okay. <br/>I proceeded to go into the water and catch 11 fish myself. The city kid from Boston with the Hawaiian sling versus Aqua  Man. I'm going to need a boat to tow this one in. I've never seen anything that big before. <br/>Sometimes I really like Boston Rob...  Boston style. <br/>Other times I see kind of an arrogant pain in the ass. <br/>He got a couple fish. <br/>Very good. You know, he wants to be the man. <br/>I think Rupert was shocked when he saw that I brought back  so many fish. I think it made him realize that we can use Rupert or the  Hawaiian sling. A Hawaiian sling doesn't need any rice. So Rupert's stock just went down about 20 points. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. All right, first things first. Boston Rob. Immunity back up for grabs. For today's immunity challenge, we're going to test your skills  with a variety of weapons. Along the way, you will earn arrows that you will use in the  final round. First round: blow gun. Each tribe member will get one chance. At the end of the round, the tribe who's closest to the center  of the target earns two arrows. Losing tribe earns one arrow. Second round: you will throw a spear with the same result. The tribe that's closest to the center earns two more arrows. Losing tribe earns one arrow. For the final round, you will take the arrows you've earned and  select one tribe member to be your archer. They will fire arrows at the final target. Closest to the center of the target wins immunity for their  tribe. If you win immunity, you are guaranteed a one-in-ten shot at  being the sole survivor. Big stakes. Chapera, you have one extra member. Cannot sit out the same person in back-to-back challenges. Big Tom sat out yesterday. Who's sitting out today? <br/>Okay, I'll sit out. <br/>Probst: All right, Alicia will have a spot on the bench. Everybody else wait for my go. All right, first round-- blow guns. We've randomly drew numbers. Chapera will fire first. Jenna. <br/>Put her in the red. <br/>Probst: The end of the round, the tribe who is closest to  the center of the target earns two arrows. <br/>That's it, Jenna. Nice and relaxed. <br/>Probst: Jenna, deflects off the target. No hit. Mogo Mogo. Jerri. First shot for Mogo Mogo. Jerri connects. Mogo Mogo first on the board. Next up for Chapera. Amber. Just not enough wind for Amber. [chuckling] Shii Ann trying to better Jerri's mark. Shii Ann just short of the target. Boston Rob. Trying to get Chapera on the board. Boston Rob misses wide to the right. Chapera still not on the board. Kathy up for Mogo Mogo. [laughs] Kathy just shy of the target. Mogo Mogo still with the mark to beat. Rupert doesn't connect. Challenge proving more difficult than we thought. Ethan far short of the target. Big Tom, the last shot for Chapera. That's the mark to beat, Big Tom, or Mogo Mogo wins. <br/>Come on, Big Tom. <br/>Probst: Big Tom can't do it. With one connection, Jerri wins. Mogo Mogo earns two arrows, Chapera one. Moving to the next round. [cheering] After the first round, Mogo Mogo with two arrows. Chapera with one. It's time for spear tossing. Mogo Mogo's up first. Trying to get closest to the center of the target, Jerri. Just left. <br/>Good try, Jerri. <br/>Probst: Chapera, you're up. And he does. Nice shot. Close. Chapera still with the mark to beat. Kathy up for Mogo Mogo. <br/>[sighs]: Oh. <br/>Good try, Kathy. <br/>Probst: Big Tom up for Chapera. No messing around. Not better than what Rupert put up. Ethan up for Mogo Mogo. Nice shot. Not quite inside of Rupert's. Boston Rob for Chapera. Nice shot. Not enough. Comes down to the last shot for Mogo Mogo. Lex. Two more arrows at stake, Lex. Got to get inside Rupert's toss, which means you have to be in  the yellow. Nope, just outside. Chapera wins. Both tribes move into the final round with three arrows. <br/>Nice job, Rupert. <br/>Probst: Moving into the final round, each tribe has three  arrows. You need to select your archers. Chapera, who's it going to be? Boston Rob. For Mogo Mogo? Jerri. Rock, paper, scissors to see who shoots first. Rock, paper... you want to go last, I assume? <br/>You go first. <br/>Probst: Jerri's up first for Mogo Mogo. You'll each have three arrows. Closest to the target wins immunity for your tribe. Jerri, any experience with a bow and arrow? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Jerri misses just to the right. Boston Rob up for Chapera. <br/>Come on, Rob. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob, any previous experience with a bow and  arrow? <br/>Uh, my brother is a bow hunter. Tried to teach me a little bit before I left. <br/>Come on, Rob. <br/>Probst: Just to the left. Jerri shooting her second arrow. Misses just to the right. Jerri down to her last arrow. Boston Rob with his second arrow. Still nobody has hit the target. Boston Rob on the target. Not a great shot, but you are on the board. Jerri with the last shot for Mogo Mogo. <br/>You got it, Jerri. <br/>Probst: This is your last arrow, Jerri. You've got to get inside Rob's hit. A lot of pressure. You don't get inside Rob's hit, Tribal Council tonight for Mogo  Mogo. Somebody being voted out. Wide to the right. That's it. Chapera wins immunity. Mogo Mogo heading to Tribal Council. Chapera, once again, immunity going back to camp with you. Congratulations. Safe from the vote. Mogo Mogo, not as good news for you. Jerri stepped up into a make-orbreak position. Didn't work out. You look frustrated. <br/>JERRI [drily]: Really. I wonder why. <br/>Probst: The result is Tribal Council tonight. Somebody's going home. I'll see you there. You can head back to camp. <br/>I'm just... I'm really sorry, you guys. <br/>It happens. <br/>Don't beat yourself up. <br/>I know, I'm trying not to, but it's hard. <br/>Don't beat yourself up. Let's just get the fire going. <br/>It's just hard not to. <br/>Is the fire on still? <br/>We need a monsoon here. <br/>I don't want to go to Tribal Council. <br/>But we got...  I'm pissed because I stuck my neck out. And I blew it. I blew it. I've lost the immunity challenge for everybody today. The disappointment mixed with my fear of being blamed and voted  out tonight is just... overwhelming me. <br/>[whispers]: You talked to Kathy already, right? <br/>Not that much. <br/>So we're going to... tonight we're going to... we're going  to take Ethan out. I think that strategically it just makes the most sense now. Do you agree? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I mean, he's just...  I'm just... Yeah. I'm just glad it's not me. <br/>Not you. <br/>But if for some reason...  No, it's... no. No, no, no, no. That's just completely just... don't even talk about it 'cause  he may try to pull a Hail Mary move of some sort, and it's just not worth it  for us. We can stay in this game. You don't need to ask me about it, but it's Ethan tonight. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>I won't say another word. <br/>All right. Um, he's just... he's a charmer. <br/>Yeah. <br/>He's a nice guy. Um... it's dangerous. Ethan and I came into this game with a bit of a handicap, and  that is that we have not just, you know... we're not just acquaintances  outside the game. We're good friends. I knew that the last thing he wanted to have happen to him in  this game was to be blindsided and to get voted out without knowing about it  ahead of time. And I think the honorable thing to do here was to tell him when  it was going to happen. I've got my own agenda this time; I've got my own plan. It doesn't include him. I can't afford ballast; I can't afford dead weight; and I  certainly can't be dragging an ex-winner along with me just because he's my  friend. This isn't Africa. This is All-Star. There are two things I need to talk to you about. I mean, one is the game. And one is our friendship. And the two things... and I know it's hard for you at this point  to see how one can, you know, somehow exist separate from the other, but I'm  going to try to make you understand how it has to be that way. Um, I think that at this point, it's just, it's better for my  game if we vote you out tonight. But it has nothing to do with friendship. This is business. Strictly business. And I have to play the game differently this time around,  because the first time around, I lost. <br/>You have to play... Lex, as much as you say you want it,  this is business, it's not. <br/>It's not easy for me to tell you this 'cause I know how  disappointing this is. Am I having fun doing this? No. Am I taking pleasure in telling you this? No. In fact, this is horrible. But I wanted... I wanted to talk to you about this 'cause I  didn't want to blindside you, and I didn't think that it was right, I didn't  think it was fair, and I didn't think it was cool. And I know... that it's a major drag for you to go out of the  game for Jerri, and I understand that. <br/>She's done nothing for this game; she's done nothing for  this tribe; she's done nothing for you; and you're rewarding her with it. She does not deserve to be here. She didn't lift a finger over there. <br/>That's why. She's not much of a threat. <br/>But she does not deserve to be here. <br/>I know that. <br/>She does not deserve to be here. <br/>Sorry. And, dude, I'm sorry. <br/>Don't apologize. What pisses me off the most is, if they think Jerri more worthy  to stay in this game than I am, then... that there's something wrong with  their screws in their head, and I don't know what game they're playing. Lex is like... I told Lex, you know, Jerri doesn't deserve to be  here, all that smack. He's, like, "That's little stuff to me." He's, like,  "I don't care." He's, like, "I'll deal with that."  Jerri's a vote I can... I can pull her along and get rid of her whenever I  want. She'll do anything I say. That's... [grunts] [growls]  I know, I know. <br/>And she's gonna get further than you...  No. <br/>She might. There's no rhyme or reason of how Lex is playing this game. There'll be no sense of security with Lex at any time. I mean, he told me that. I mean, he told me that over there, 'cause that's why he's  voting me off. <br/>When I talked to Ethan, and I looked into his eyes, you  know, I truly would love to bring him with us. He is a nice guy. He has a big heart. [whispering]: I do not believe he'll bring me along for very  long. Because I don't trust anybody in this game. But I don't want to take Lex out before Jerri. <br/>No. <br/>It would be Jerri tonight. All right. <br/>So I'll vote for Jerri, and then you and she can talk  about it, and I'll... I'm a gambler. <br/>I'm leaning towards you, believe me. I don't know, there's something, again, about looking into  Ethan's eyes and also looking into Lex's eyes. There is a moment that you need to trust and have loyalty in  this game. You've got to. There is no way I want Jerri in the final four. I just don't want her around. I want somebody, truly, that plays the game well, but also  works. I want somebody with bug bites on them and scratches and their  fingers are gnarled. I'm sorry. It's just the way I am. I've been thinking about it, but the sun's going down. I don't have much time. <br/>Probst: Hello, guys. I don't have much time. <br/>Probst: Hello, guys. Day 21. Let's talk about today's challenge. Jerri, you ended up in the heroor-goat role, depending on how it  came out. Was that your choice? Were you elected? Was it random? <br/>I volunteered, um, because I do have archery experience,  and... my tribe trusted and believed in me, and I let them down. I apologize profusely. So regardless of the outcome, I feel good about it. <br/>Probst: Shii Ann, is there a little bit of relief when somebody  else steps up and says, "I'll take that role," knowing that at  least you can't be the goat? <br/>Today Jerri volunteered. I believed her. We all believed her, and unfortunately, we lost. But that could have happened with anyone. <br/>Probst: Kathy, would Jerri be thinking irrationally if she  was a little worried that maybe tonight that challenge is gonna come back to  haunt her? <br/>You know, I'm sure she's concerned about it. You know, it'd be under my skin if I stepped forward like that. Especially now, when things are dwindling. You know, it's human nature. I'm sure she's concerned. <br/>Probst: Ethan, has it crossed your mind that you're the  last remaining previous winner in this game? <br/>Yeah, it has. I like that. I'm proud of the way I played, and I'm happy that I'm still  here. <br/>Probst: What about you is the biggest threat to the other  four sitting here tonight? <br/>I think, uh, I'm a threat to these other four because, uh,  I'm a winner. But in addition to that, that's something they should look into,  saying, "Well, that's an advantage as well." No one's gonna vote  for a winner in the final two, Jeff. Principle alone, no one wants to see a winner win again. <br/>Probst: Lex, you kind of... had a weird reaction to that. <br/>I don't think that's necessarily true. In fact, if I was on the jury, and if that winner was shrewd  enough to just make a good, pointed argument that, "You know what? I came into this game with the biggest target on my back. None of you figured I could ever get this far, and the fact  that, even against all odds, I made it to the final two," I'd have a  hard time picking reasons not to vote him to win because that guy made it  against all odds. <br/>Probst: Tough game. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Touch decisions. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: It is time to vote. Shii Ann, you're up. <br/>Jerri, um, today you took Shii Ann, you're up. <br/>Jerri, um, today you took my life into your hands and you  blew it. I feel you've not played the game well; I feel you've not worked  hard enough; and I think you should be voted off. <br/>It's really, really easy to win with grace and dignity,  but it's much harder to lose with that same grace and dignity. Let's see how you do. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... E.Z. Ethan. Jerri. One vote Jerri, one vote Ethan. Ethan. That's two votes Ethan, one vote Jerri. Eighth person voted out of the tribe... Ethan. Three's enough votes. You need to bring me your torch. Ethan, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Have fun. Play hard. Don't let the bedbugs bite. <br/>Probst: Well, you've made it 21 days. With 18 days left, trust will become the single most valuable  resource in this game, and the most difficult thing to find. See how it plays out. Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

Next time on Survivor:  Being on a losing team all the time-- it's just  depressing. <br/>Probst: The gap between the tribes couldn't be wider. <br/>We was just tickled to death. <br/>Probst: But while everyone is talking merge...  I'm ready for a merge. I'm ready for all of us to be one tribe. <br/>Probst: ...what happens next will turn their world upside  down. Drop your buffs. <br/>I feel like I'm the one who got screwed in this whole  situation. <br/>I do have some solace in knowing that, uh, I played the  game my way. Tonight I had no control over what happened. You know, I fought to the bitter end, and I got further than any  other winner, and I'm extremely proud of that, and I wouldn't trade any of  this experience. I'll treasure this for the rest of my life. Thank you.
