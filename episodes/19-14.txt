<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor...  I can already see I'm the ruler in this kingdom. Who gets grapes fed to them? The kings do. <br/>Probst: Since the merge, the Foa Foa four has joined forces with Shambo. <br/>I aligned with Foa Foa from the first time I went over to their tribe. <br/>Probst: Time for you to go. But now that they're in the majority...  There is definitely part of me that wants to make a big move. <br/>Probst: ...their loyalties have become clouded by thoughts of the endgame. <br/>Mick is freaking out. That worries me that he's gonna send me home 'cause that's what I would do. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! After Brett saved himself by winning immunity... Brett does not have to worry  about going home tonight. ...Monica was on the hot seat, so she stirred up trouble so she stirred up  trouble around camp... around camp...  Probst: ...in a desperate  Probst: ...in a desperate attempt to stay alive. attempt to stay alive. <br/>Probst: But her plan didn't work...  You are a little snake in the grass. <br/>Probst: ... and the Foa Foa  Probst: ... and the Foa Foa four sent her packing. four sent her packing. Well, there are six of you left in this game now. Not everybody's gonna make it to the final, so, while it may not have worked  for Monica tonight, gonna be a lot more scrambling to come. Grab your torches. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. <br/>God! Wow! Wow! Thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you. <br/>I love head rubs. I'm basically sitting around the campfire that I've known for 33 days with an  entirely different group of people than I would have ever imagined. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>I'm the last true Galu, and I'm a fighter, and I'm gonna keep doing what I'm  doing and make it as far as possible. <br/>That tribal wasn't too bad. I expected worse. Stay on our plan, and we'll be okay. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And, uh, we-we just... Man, I'm going to push it to Man, I'm going to push it  to the limits. the limits. Because if he don't go, we're gonna be in a world of crap. Monica going home was an extremely easy choice. It would have been Brett, but because he won the immunity, then it had to be  Monica. So, as soon as Brett loses, he's gone. He has to, because he'll keep winning and keep winning all the way to the top. the way to the top. âª âª  "I pray that out of his glorious riches, he may strengthen you through  his spirit and your inner being so that Christ may dwell in your hearts  through faith." There's a lot of cards stacked up against me, but I'm  definitely gonna try to work what I have here. And Natalie and I, you know, kind of come from, I think, a similar walk of  life, and I think something like that is a great foundation for a trusting  relationship, so, you know, I think that that personal interaction  potentially could turn into something fairly promising. "That you may be filled to the measure of all with the fullness of  God." Ephesians, 3:16 through 19. <br/>That was good. Oh, my gosh, Brett is an absolute sweetheart. I mean, Brett and I have had, um, several discussions about the bible and  about some Christian books. Um, I've really enjoyed that, so it's been nice to have that in common. <br/>I want to just keep lying here. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Oh...  Oh...  I think I have to go wet my head down. Look at my hair. [Russell laughs] I need a haircut. <br/>Shambo said she needed a haircut. <br/>Oh, my goodness. <br/>She should shave that ho' head. Mullet went out in the '70s. It looks terrible. Her hair is funky. You see Shambo-- that's where she sneaks food. She puts it in her hair. Nobody knows. Nobody can see it. She puts bananas in there and-and pieces of coconut. It's nasty. Peanuts, all kinds of different stuff. It's kind of disgusting. If I didn't need Shambo, I would definitely get rid of her because, you know,  I know we got to look at that bush of hair that she has, but I'm doing  whatever it takes to win the whatever it takes to win the game. game. game. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Yes. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, you'll divide into two teams of three. Here's how it works. There are a series of intersecting ropes holding up coconuts. One at a time, you'll walk out and pull one rope out. Your goal-- drop as few coconuts as possible. Every time you drop a coconut, it counts against your team. First team to 100 coconuts loses. The other team wins reward. I know you want to know what you're playing for. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: The winning team will leave here. You'll be taken to a local village. You'll then have a massive feast. You will spend the night in the village, sleeping on a mattress with a pillow  and some blankets. Then, you'll return back to camp in the morning. On day 34, could be a big, big difference heading into the next immunity  challenge. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Definitely. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Worth dying for. <br/>Probst: All right, we're gonna draw for teams. Looking for two captains. Yellow and purple are the captains. Please don't look. Please don't look. Let me share in the surprise. Let me share in the surprise. All right, everybody, palms up. Reveal. Russell is a captain. Natalie is a captain. All right, Russell, Natalie-- rock, paper, scissor to see who chooses first. Paper covers rock. Natalie chooses first. <br/>Uh, I'm gonna go with Brett. <br/>Probst: Brett joins Natalie. All right, Russell, your choice. <br/>Jaison. <br/>Mick. <br/>Probst: Natalie chooses Mick, which means Shambo joins Russell. There's our two teams. Russell, Jaison and Shambo taking on Natalie, Brett and Mick. Mick. Let's get started. Let's get started. All right, we have our two teams. Yellow, you're up. Shambo out on the course for yellow. You can go on either side. The goal is simple-- pull a rope out and drop as few coconuts as possible. First team to 100 coconuts loses this challenge. What do you call that hair, Shambo? [Shambo laughs]  Shambolicious, baby. <br/>Probst: How long you had it? <br/>Since 1986. <br/>Probst: 23 years. That's a commitment to a hairstyle. <br/>You don't mess with perfection, baby. <br/>Probst: Shambo makes her choice for yellow. Releases the rope. Now you got to pull it through. Starting to get a little rain. That'll make it fun. <br/>Watch that one on the top right. It's moving. <br/>Be careful when you're pulling 'em, Sham. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Shambo drops four coconuts. As this game will go, that's not bad. <br/>Good job, Shambo. <br/>Feels good, looks good. Aha, oo-rah. Love it, love it, love it. <br/>Probst: Yellow, first on the board with four. Purple, you're up. Mick heads out for purple. <br/>All right, Mick, nice and easy. Slow and steady. <br/>Probst: Mick makes his choice for purple. <br/>Yes. Keep it coming, baby. <br/>Probst: By simply releasing the rope, two coconuts drop. <br/>It's okay, Mick. Hey, slow and steady. <br/>Probst: This challenge is all about what you don't want. You don't want coconuts today. Mick gets out with just two coconuts. Purple with two. <br/>Good job, Mick. <br/>Probst: Yellow has four. Jaison out on the course for Jaison out on the course for yellow. yellow. <br/>Probst: Jaison trying to make  Probst: Jaison trying to make some sense out of this. some sense out of this. some sense out of this. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Thank you, Jesus. <br/>Probst: Jaison's made his choice. See how it goes. Two drop right away. [Jaison sighs] [Jaison sighs] Here we go. Here we go. That is a total of seven coconuts, bringing yellow's total to 11. Purple, you're up. Sooner or later, somebody's gonna have a big pull, and a lot of coconuts are  going to drop. Natalie makes her choice for purple. <br/>There's another one moving 'cause of the vibration. Easy. You're doing good. <br/>Probst: Natalie drops one coconut. Natalie gets through with only Natalie gets through with only one coconut. one coconut. Purple with only three. Yellow, you're up. Russell makes his choice. Right off the bat. A bundle of coconuts drop. Eight more coconuts for yellow, bringing yellow's total to 19. Purple at three. <br/>Oh, going to get one. <br/>Probst: Brett can see one coconut hanging in the balance. That coconut will drop. Purple with only four coconuts right now. 19-four. Shambo makes her selection for yellow. And right away, a whole lot of coconuts drop. Ten more added to their score. Yellow now at 29, purple sitting on four. sitting on four. Mick selects for purple. Mick selects for purple. Mick hasn't even started to pull the rope and coconuts are falling. The gap is closing with each coconut that drops. coconut that drops. <br/>You rock, God. <br/>You rock, God. <br/>Probst: Mick drops 19 coconuts. Just like that, yellow is back in this challenge. <br/>I just couldn't see much. <br/>You got two prayer warriors on your team, so...  Probst: Jaison makes his choice for yellow. choice for yellow. <br/>Easy, J, nice and easy. <br/>Easy, J, nice and easy. <br/>Probst: Well, Jaison is finished, but drops 48 coconuts. After Jaison's turn, yellow now at 77. Purple at 23. Natalie has had good luck in this challenge so far. <br/>Probst: Remember, the first team to 100 loses. Purple sitting pretty at only 23 coconuts. Natalie makes her choice for purple. <br/>My prediction is 58. <br/>Probst: Russell, Jaison, and Shambo hoping a whole lot of coconuts drop. <br/>Oh, my word, oh, my word. <br/>Probst: And they do. <br/>Y'all, oh, my word. <br/>Probst: Natalie dropped 58 for purple. <br/>Oh, my god, I guessed it. <br/>Probst: Bringing their total to 81. This challenge gonna come down to the wire. Russell heads out for yellow. Yellow sitting on 77. Big move right here by Russell. Russell eyeballing it for the yellow team. There are very few ropes left in this challenge...  You got it, baby. <br/>Probst: ...that will not drop any coconuts. Russell makes his choice, releases the rope. Now you got to thread it through. <br/>Easy, baby. <br/>Slow and easy, baby, slow and easy. easy. <br/>I can't look. <br/>I can't look. <br/>Come on, baby, come on. <br/>Probst: Russell gets through without any damage. No coconuts added to their total. <br/>Dude, are you freaking kidding me? <br/>Nicely done. <br/>Probst: Russell really putting the pressure on purple. Brett up now for purple. Brett, you are sitting at 81 coconuts. 19 or more, and your team is out. It's all on you. This could be it. <br/>Nice and steady, B. <br/>Easy pulls, easy pulls. <br/>Probst: Looking good so far. <br/>Come on. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: More coconuts for purple. Brett gets through. Now, let's see what the damage is. 23 coconuts, bringing them to 104. It's over. Yellow wins reward. Russell, Jaison, and Shambo going on reward. <br/>You all enjoy it. <br/>Probst: Natalie, Brett, Mick, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. <br/>Have fun. <br/>Probst: Russell, Shambo, Jaison, enjoy your afternoon and your evening. You'll return to camp in the morning. Grab your stuff, head out. Have a good time. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Definitely concerned about Natalie after she picked Brett and Mick. I'm starting to get more worried about inter-divisions that, you know, may be  starting to appear know, may be starting to appear in our alliance. in our alliance. <br/>Hi, how are you? <br/>Talofa la. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you very much. <br/>That smells really good. When we won the reward, you know, reward didn't mean much to me 'cause I  didn't know what a reward was. I'd never been on a reward. <br/>On behalf of our village, I say "Talofa." It means  "Welcome."  Thank you. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>You ain't lying, Shambo. Oh, my gosh. You see what I'm seeing? <br/>This is the best part of the pig right there, baby. My favorite. <br/>Every single day out here has been a grind. Every single day out here has been a loss. Every single day out here has been an attempt to survive another day in the  game of Survivor. <br/>Mmm! <br/>This is really good. But once I got there, it was a completely different experience. To have that day off was absolutely amazing. absolutely amazing. [shouting] [shouting]  How's the lobster? <br/>After eating all them crabs all that time, first thing I go for is the  lobster. <br/>Hey, lobster ain't crab, man. <br/>As soon as I won the challenge, I thought that's perfect for me because the  food gives me energy, gets me pumped up. I'll take any edge I can get right now. Lobster. Mick and Brett, it makes them weaker because they didn't get to eat. They're going to be thirsty, dehydrated, hungry, so I think it's a great  thing that they didn't win today. <br/>My only goal right now is top three with you. All right, I can get down with that. <br/>Yeah, I'm thinking exactly the same thing. <br/>All right, we're good. <br/>I would like to make a toast to the people of Samoa-- from my heart to your  heart, thank you for the warmth, the food, the companionship. Thank you. <br/>Cheers. [applause] [laughter]  What I most wanted to do in Samoa was be part of that cultural experience  with the native tribes here, and I was so happy. happy. It superseded my expectation. It superseded my expectation. <br/>I have been fortified by the power of food, and I'm about to get jiggy with  it. [Shambo shouts]  Get it, Shambo. Work it. <br/>To be able to share the experience with two of the guys, watch them truly  enjoying themselves, it was great. <br/>I got it, I got it. <br/>I have to continue to build those relationships through the rest of the game,  truthfully. It's a day-by-day thing out here. <br/>Three-way hug. <br/>Nice job today, you guys. I love you guys. <br/>I got an idea. I was thinking it'd be cool since, obviously, we're not on a lavish reward,  but, you know, I think we could take it as a day to just take a break and  enjoy each other's company. I was thinking we could all go get snails. <br/>I think that would be fun. <br/>And then once we have all our food together, we can just take it all to the  beach and just chill on the beach and watch the sunset together. <br/>Super fun. <br/>I think that's perfect, man, I was thinking the same thing. <br/>Just no games, just enjoy ourselves. <br/>I'm in, man, that sounds great. That's exactly what I had in mind. <br/>Who's in? <br/>I'm in! <br/>Awesome. Reward, seriously. <br/>Whoo-hoo! <br/>We lost the challenge today, so what we're planning on doing is just cooking  up some food together. You know, in a weird way, create a reward for ourselves. Actually, go to the right. <br/>Oh, to the right? <br/>Yeah, to that rock. I don't play this game overly aggressively. I don't want to get in people's faces, but at the same time, you know, it's  just cool to hang out with each other and nurture the with each other and  nurture the relationships. relationships. I feel proud to be the last true Galu member. [Mick chuckles] 'Cause it kind of feels like you invited some strangers over  to your house, you know, to-- you know, and then they ended up moving in and  all your, all of your family left. It's kind of a, it's kind of a bizarre-- it's kind of a weird feeling, but...   Yeah. Sorry, man. Sorry, man. <br/>No, man, it is what it is. <br/>No, man, it is what it is. <br/>Brett and Mick and myself-- we just decided today we're going to have good  attitudes, and we really just enjoyed each other, and I like Mick and Brett a  whole lot. In the bag? <br/>I got-- yeah, I'm just putting them up here. <br/>Okay. Brett's an amazing person. If I have to be standing next to a Galu, you know, Brett is awesome. But I've been in with Russell since the very first day. Honestly, it's the hardest thing to balance your heart and your head as far  as strategically, and then what your heart's telling you. It is so tough, so, you know, hopefully, my mind is thinking clear enough to  look at the end clear enough to look at the end to be able to win the game. to be able to win the game. <br/>Lord have mercy. Sheets and blankets, and I have a pillow. <br/>This pillow is amazing. <br/>Yeah, it is. <br/>Jaison, look. [Shambo laughs] [Shambo laughs] I'm in my little net. I'm in my little net. Dude, I'm seven all the time. I'm just a little goofball. That's what makes me happy, though. <br/>That's good. <br/>Being silly. Being a grown-up is just so overrated when you don't have to be. <br/>So why do you-- honestly, why do you think Natalie picked Brett first today? I mean, that was an interesting choice for me-- to me. <br/>Dude, it was...  Is that what you call it-- "interesting"? <br/>Interesting. <br/>I'll tell you what I call it: very telling. <br/>You know, when I get back to camp, I'm gonna have to bring Natalie to the  side and solidify-- you know, spend about two hours with her to, you know,  solidify what we have because no telling what they're talking about over  there. <br/>Yeah, that's true. <br/>They're thinking that Natalie is aligning herself with Brett and Mick. That ain't happening. I know, I know for a fact, Natalie's with me. Let's say Brett wins immunity. We get rid of Mick. And then next time, let's say one of us wins. We get rid of Brett. But the thing is I'm putting it in their head. Well, maybe something is going on with Mick, Natalie, and Brett, so we're  gonna have to stop it immediately. Me, you, Jaison-- as soon as one of Mick or Brett is gone, we are running the  show. My whole point of this is to get rid of Brett or Mick. Those two are a big threat. They're likable guys. Then there's nothing else that can stop me. We gonna have to blindside everybody. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Everybody left. <br/>If you had said last week or a few days ago, "Mick," I would have  been, like, "You must have lost your mind. He's Foa Foa. I'm not doing that." It's, like, now, I don't know. Peace. Peace. [Russell laughs] [Russell laughs] [indistinct chatter]  ...what has transpired, and so I'm like this. Here's... Here's our hut. It's a little round hut, right? It's a little round hut, right? It has a little tiki roof... It has a little tiki roof...  They freaked out. Everybody. Every single person there. <br/>Freaked out? <br/>It made them want to get rid of Mick because you did that. They're like, "Oh, you know, they might get together. Mick might be..." Mick... No...  Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Mick might be...  Mick might be...  Mick might be...  And it's-it's so easy now. <br/>And it's-it's so easy now. <br/>But it's okay because it don't matter what each individual thinks over there,  'cause I'm in control of it all. [Natalie laughs]  You had no doubt in your  You had no doubt in your mind, I hope... mind, I hope...  I had to think a little bit. <br/>Russell, from the very first day, he told me, "I'll take you to the  final two if I can trust you," and I was, like, "You can trust  me." I've been completely honest with him, letting him know what's going  on, and, um, we've kind of been on the same page with everything, so, we  actually have quite a bit of power. Two brains are better than one. <br/>Everything is perfectly fine. <br/>Everything is perfectly fine. It's more now than ever. It's more now than ever. <br/>It couldn't have worked out better for us. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>All I know is, someone has to beat Brett next time. <br/>Yes, for sure. If it's not, then we've got to get rid of Mick. If we can prevent Brett from winning immunity, then today will be a wonderful  day. There's gonna be no argument. He has to go. He's a little punk. He's 110 pounds. He's not faster than me. He's not stronger than me. So he's not a huge threat to win the challenges. But he is a huge threat to win the million dollars. It is done. They say don't get confident in this game. You know what? I'm confident as hell right now. <br/>Since you are, then I am. <br/>Since you are, then I am. How about that one? How about that one? How about that one? [snorting] [snorting] [snorting]  Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes! <br/>Yup. <br/>Probst: Give it up, Brett. <br/>Probst: Give it up, Brett. <br/>Got to do it. <br/>Got to do it. <br/>Probst: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will race out into a field where you must count  the number of objects in each of the six stations. You'll use tiles to remember the number for each item you've counted. You will then use those numbers to solve a combination lock. The order of the numbers will be different for each person. First person to get it right and break their tile wins immunity and is  guaranteed a spot in the final five. [Shambo sighs] Losers, you know the drill-- Tribal Council. Somebody going home. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. Here we go, for immunity and a guaranteed spot in the final five, survivors  ready? five, survivors ready? Go! Go! Six stations. Six stations. Count the objects in each one. Count the objects in each one. Count the objects in each one. <br/>One, two, three, four...  One, two, three, four... [squealing]  Probst: There are six different stations. Your job is to count the objects in each of the stations, and you need to be  right, or that lock will not open, and you will have will not open, and you  will have to come back and count again. to come back and count again. Russell has a couple of numbers. Russell has a couple of numbers. He's heading back. He's heading back.

Natalie still counting the fish. <br/>Six, seven, eight...  Six, seven, eight...  Probst: Brett heading back. <br/>Probst: Brett heading back. Natalie finally leaves the fish station. Moving on to the octopus. [squealing]  No moving, no moving. [snorting]  Probst: Shambo with a big old smile on her face heading back. Russell heading back again.

Back again. Once again, Brett is safe at Tribal Council. Guaranteed a spot in the final five. Shambo, Russell, Jaison, Natalie, Mick-- after 36 long days, one of you going  home tonight. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I'll see you at Tribal. <br/>It's so frustrating, Brett winning two in a row. He might win three. What if he wins four? Then, we're screwed. Russell and I said it, if Brett wins immunity again, that we would get rid of  Mick. But I think that Shambo's just not helping in the challenges to beat Brett  so, you know, tonight's Shambo's night. And we're just gonna get rid of And we're just gonna get rid of her. her. <br/>He wants to get rid of Mick. It's like he ain't talking nok. more the rest of the day. He said he's too aggravated. He said he don't want to deal With Mick I ain't talking to you the rest of  the day. That's the plan. That's it. And he walked away. I don't really want to talk about it, either. We just get back to camp and Jaison walks up to me immediately and says,  "hey, you know what has to happen. We got to get rid of Shambo." But I didn't want to do it this route. I want to get Mick out of here first. Right now, it's Mick. <br/>Okay. <br/>That was the plan from the beginning. <br/>That was the plan. If he changes his mind, I'll let you know. <br/>He's just really frustrated. <br/>Yeah, that's why he's walking off from everybody. I'm frustrated, too. We didn't want Brett to win immunity but he did. Worst-case scenario is for Brett to keep winning. His whole crew is over there watching him on the jury, but right now, we have  a decision to make-- either Mick or Shambo. <br/>His exact words to you were what? <br/>I went up to him, I said-- he walked over there, I said "Still on, we  voting Mick? He's like, "Yeah." And then you walked up and he walked away. <br/>See, that makes me a little bit nervous but whatever. As soon as I walked up, Russ and Jaison were talking, and Jaison bolted. And I said, "What's that all about?" And Russ is like, "He's  done talking." So that makes me a little uneasy. Does Jaison want to vote me? <br/>He told me he wanted to still stay with Mick, but...  He did? <br/>But then he just walks off after we finished the conversation, when you walk  up. <br/>I know, that made me nervous. I attributed more helpfulness to the Foa Foa tribe than anybody, and I don't  think they're ever gonna forget that, but I don't think anybody's beyond the  chopping block, beyond the chopping block, including myself. including myself. <br/>And I'll tell you what, I don't even like her breath. And she always wants to talk to you three inches away from your face and you  gonna smell that... breath. I don't even know why she's still here. I know why she's still here. 'Cause we're using her stupid butt for votes. <br/>Wow, that's the first time I've heard you talk about her like that. <br/>She's been getting on my nerves since day one. We ain't buddy-buddy. She's gone. That's the plan, right? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I was a little surprised. It was a little shocking. Russell has spent a lot of time with Shambo, you know, cultivating that  relationship, and, you know, now it sounds like he's kind of scheming to vote  her off? <br/>I can't wait till she's gone, dude. One day without her would be heaven. <br/>I think you've got to be skeptical all the time, and always assume that  something else is going on in somebody's mind. Every time somebody smiles at you, you know, what's going on, really, in  their minds? Of course there's a chance that Russell is lying to me and they could be taking  me out tonight. So, I mean, I'm anxious as hell. So, I mean, I'm anxious as hell. It scares the hell out of me. It scares the hell out of me. He thinks it's you. <br/>He does? Now, what in God's name would lead him to believe that? <br/>'Cause that's what we had to tell him to make him shut up. <br/>Oh, really? <br/>Oh, really? I'm not comfortable. I'm not comfortable. <br/>My decision tonight is either Shambo or Mick. I can keep Shambo around 'cause she's gonna not ever put my name down. She's horrible at the challenges, and she ain't gonna get any votes for the  million dollars. That's three good reasons, extremely good reasons. The only good reason to keep Mick around, there's one-- and that's to keep  athletes together to be able to beat Brett in the next immunity challenge. So right now, I'm really not So right now, I'm really not sure what I'm gonna  do. sure what I'm gonna do. <br/>Are you going to play it? <br/>I'm just going to put it around my neck and walk in there like Russell being  Russell. <br/>This is the last time you can play that thing, right? <br/>This is it. Yeah, 36. <br/>36. <br/>The hidden immunity idol-- I'm going to have it around my my neck. Today is the last day I can play it. Even if I didn't have it I wouldn't be getting voted off, wouldn't be getting  voted off, but I have it, so I'll be fine. but I have it, so I'll be fine. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in  Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. the members of our jury. Erik, Kelly, Laura, John, Dave, and Monica voted out at the and Monica voted  out at the last Tribal Council. last Tribal Council. All right, Russell, one Tribal after another, you've voted out former Galu  members. We get to tonight, there's really only one true former Galu left, because  Shambo's been with you guys for a long time. <br/>I'm a traitor. [laughs]  Probst: that's a fair statement, right? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Probst: So, Natalie, when you think about voting somebody out tonight, Shambo  betrayed everybody on the jury. You can't win without some of those people voting for you. Not going to happen. <br/>Yeah, absolutely. I don't think that they would vote for her, based off of that. So, it is a-- opportunity to keep someone that I think I can beat. <br/>Probst: So, Russell, how big a factor is that loyalty with Shambo going into  a vote like this? <br/>I think that she's helped us tremendously. And I trust Shambo as much as I trust the Foa Foa members. <br/>Probst: That's a big statement. <br/>I do. <br/>Probst: So what kind of criteria comes into play tonight? <br/>There's phases to this game. Right now, we're in the end phase. And that phase is who's gonna get the most votes for the million dollars. <br/>Probst: Jaison, do you agree with that? <br/>I definitely think that in terms of voting somebody off tonight, we have to  think about someone who can beat us at the end, and so I think everybody  thinks Brett is the one guy that could sweep a jury. But, you know, he's eluded us two challenges in a row, and so we got to go  big or go home here in the last few days. <br/>Probst: Shambo, spell it out. Why is Brett a big threat? <br/>Brett's' a big threat because he's incredibly physical. He's good at puzzles. He stayed loyal to a fault to Galu, and the jury is Galu. <br/>Probst: So, Brett, at this point, do you feel the only way you stay in this  game is to win immunity? <br/>Yeah, I mean, by doing so, you know, it gives me one step farther ahead. So my strategy is just to win the next few immunity challenges like I've done  the last few. <br/>Probst: Mick, it was you and Brett today in that challenge. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: So you're, clearly, one of the other strong, physical threats in this  game. So if it's you tonight, what's the reaction? <br/>Of course I'll be frustrated. You know, having been part of this whole thing from the get-go. I haven't played as aggressively a strategic game as Russell, but, you know,  I've always been loyal. So after all this, to go home tonight, yeah, I will be a little pissed off,  for sure. <br/>Probst: Russell, seeing how far Mick, Shambo, you, Jaison and Natalie have  come together, it's got to be tough tonight. One of you is going home. <br/>It hasn't been a tough time yet for me to vote somebody out. This is the first time that it's going to be pretty tough for me. But this is how the game goes. And sometimes you got to vote And sometimes you got to vote people out that  you like. people out that you like. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. Brett, once again you have individual immunity. I don't think there's any doubt you are keeping it. <br/>I'm definitely keeping it, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Cannot vote for Brett. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. It's time to vote. Mick, you're up. Mick, you're up. Mick, you're up. âª âª  Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If you have the hidden immunity idol around your neck and you want to play  it, tonight is the last time you can do so. <br/>You know what, Jeff? I think I'm gonna keep it for a souvenir. <br/>Probst: Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote, Shambo. First vote, Shambo. Mick. One vote Shambo, one vote Mick. Shambo.

Time for you to go. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Good luck, you guys. <br/>Good luck, you guys. <br/>Probst: Well, there's only one thing standing in the way of the Foa Foa  foursome making it all the way to the final four. And his name is Brett. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time... On a very special two-hour season finale. After 37 days, 15 have lost the battle. Now for the final five, it's Now for the final five, it's war. war. <br/>The Foa Foa is a very, very loyal group. And although I helped to get them where they are in the positions they're  gonna finally land in, they were loyal and true to their tribe, as it should  be. I think that's awesome. I want to thank all the members that have served in the military. Oo-rah. Semper fi. I did the best job I could out here and I hope you're all here and I hope  you're all proud of me.
