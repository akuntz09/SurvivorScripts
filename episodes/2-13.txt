<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor: The Barramundi camp was  washed away by a flash flood. <br/>Rodger: Oh, God. <br/>Elisabeth: Wow. <br/>Tina: I saw the devastation, and my first thought was, you  know, that's our home. <br/>Colby: It wiped everything out, you know, including a good  portion of everybody's emotional steam. <br/>Elisabeth: Because this group has really endured a lot,  it's tough to have to go and cast a vote. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, the Ogakor alliance turned on one  of their own, making Amber the 11th person voted out. Five remain. Who will be the next to go? <br/>Rodger: Going to try to get Who will be the next to go? <br/>Rodger: Going to try to get everything cleaned off this  beach. We never know when we're going to have another torrential rain  like we had a couple of days ago. It took out everything. <br/>Elisabeth: I woke up this morning, and I was so wet on one  side. I'm like, "Did I go to the bathroom in my sleep,"  like, I couldn't... I don't think I've ever had that feeling because my left  side was just soaked from the ground. <br/>Keith: It rained a lot last night and our new shelter  leaked. I didn't sleep all night. Everyone was a little drained this morning. <br/>Colby: The closer you get to the end, the more you think  about what's waiting for you when you leave, be it food, be it your family,  your bed, your pillow. <br/>Tina: I miss my husband and my children more than  anything. I'm still kind of a newlywed. I've only been married just a year and a half, and my husband is  my very best friend. And I miss picking my kids up from school and having my son  happy to see me. And I just miss everything about them. <br/>Colby: With the storm that came through and the shelter,  that's the worst I've seen Tina. She was at a rock bottom. But Elisabeth's been that way for awhile. Physically, Elisabeth's run down, and emotionally, and she's the  one we've all tried to nurture a little bit. <br/>Rodger: I wish we had a couple days without any rain,  that's what I wish. It'd be nice. <br/>Elisabeth: I woke up this morning wet and still trying to  recover from being really hungry. The past four days really wrecked me. <br/>Colby: See what our tree mail says today. <br/>Keith: Oh, my gosh. <br/>Rodger: Let's hold the end of it. <br/>Colby: "For 34 days on yourself you've relied. It's your strength and your wits that the challenge has tried. Now you will trust in your loved one or mom if you hope to win  at Survivor.com. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God. E-mail? <br/>Colby: Oh, my gosh, we get to compete against each other  with our loved ones online. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God! You guys, this is awesome! <br/>Keith: Yeah! <br/>Colby: I've got chills right now. <br/>Elisabeth: I can't even contain myself! I can't even contain myself! <br/>Keith: Relax. <br/>Elisabeth: I can't. I can't. The e-mail said that we will rely on our loved one or my mom. My mom is the... she's my hero, like, she is just the most  amazing, strong woman. She got through breast cancer and chemo like a trouper, and any  time I think that things get tough out here, I know what she's been through. She's my hero. And with her, I can do anything. Let's go get ready. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. Welcome to the Outback Internet Cafe-- Survivorstyle. <br/>Colby: Whoo! <br/>Jeff: Thanks to technology, you're about to chat online  with your loved ones. <br/>Keith: Oh, isn't that amazing. <br/>Jeff: In fact, how well you do in this challenge will  really be all up to your loved ones, because they're going to be playing this  game right along with you. One at a time, you're going to ask them a series of survival  trivia questions. The loved one who answers the most questions correctly will  determine which of you will win. For the winner, a private 30- minute chat with your loved ones  online. When the winner's done chatting, I'm going to give you this Visa  card. $500 spending limit, where you can buy whatever you want for  your loved ones. Point, click, shop, 24 hours later, they'll have a package  delivered. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: It wouldn't really be a true Internet cafe if we  didn't have coffee and a Danish. So as each of you come up here to say your initial hellos, I'll  pour you a cup of coffee, pick your favorite Danish. All right, Tina, let's start with you. You look eager to say hi. Have a seat. Want a nice coffee? <br/>Tina: Sure. <br/>Jeff: And help yourself to a Danish. You have your husband Dale and your son Taylor and your daughter  Katie. <br/>Tina: Hello, family. I sure miss you. <br/>There she is. That's your mom right there. "Hello, family." Hey, babe. We love you and we...  Tina: Dale must be typing. "Hel... lo."  T and K. Cool. <br/>Tina: "Hey, babe. We love and miss you. You go, girl. Taylor, Dale and Katie."  Jeff: All right, Elisabeth, come on up. Okay, here's who's at home waiting for you: your mom Elisabeth,  your dad Kenneth and your brother Ken. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: I'm sensing a pattern there. <br/>Elisabeth: I love you bunches. Miss you more. Safe and sound. Love, Bessy. Okay. Send, okay. <br/>It's Elisabeth. "Love you bunches, miss you more, safe and sound. Love, Bessy."  Elisabeth: "Elisabeth, I can't believe it's you. Dad's here, Kenny is here. What's happening there?" I can't tell you. Love you. <br/>Jeff: Rodger, come on up. Welcome. <br/>Rodger: Thank you, buddy. <br/>Jeff: Let me tell you who you're talking to. Your wife Pat, your daughter Angela...  Rodger: Good. <br/>Jeff: ...and your son-in-law Kevin. <br/>Rodger: Good. Okay. <br/>There it is. <br/>"Hello, family. Doing good. I love you guys."  Jeff: Is that a little tear in your eye? <br/>Rodger: Yes, sir, it is. Yep. Here we go. <br/>Colby: What are they saying, Rodge? <br/>Rodger: How about you read that? <br/>Jeff: I'll read it for you. "We are doing good. We miss you and are very proud of you."  Rodger: Whoo. <br/>Elisabeth: Worth the wait, Rodger. <br/>Rodger: I knew I should have brought my sunglasses. <br/>Jeff: Come on up, Keith. All right, Keith, Katrin ring a bell? Your sweetie? She's there, waiting to hear from you. <br/>Keith: We call each other Peas and Carrots. Hello, Peas, miss you so much. I'll never be gone this long from you again. I love you. <br/>Hello, Carrots. You can call me Sweet Pea. <br/>Jeff: Right on cue, huh? <br/>"Hello, Carrots, you can call me Sweet Pea. I love you, too."  Jeff: Have a seat, Colby. Help yourself to a Danish. You've got Gaye, your mom. <br/>Colby: No way. <br/>Rodger: Oh, wow. <br/>Colby: Sweet. Hey, gang. The Colbster is still alive. I love you. The best thing about this is just being able to let her know I'm  still okay. We're best friends, and it's so much more than just a mother-son  relationship. She's everything. My mom just said, "Hi, baby." She always calls me her  baby boy because my brother's older than I am. [ sighs] That's what I needed, right there. <br/>Rodger: I guess you guys realize that us three men fell  apart worse than any of the women did. Very big strong men. <br/>Colby: I was pretty composed until she responded. <br/>Rodger: That was the way with me. <br/>Colby: I thought I was doing good until those words came  across the screen. <br/>Rodger: Once the words came up, that was it for me. <br/>Jeff: Okay, let's start the challenge. Here's the deal: you're going to each ask the same set of five  questions to your family. The winner will be the person whose family answers the most  questions correctly. Tina, you're up. Read off the questions and hit "send."  Tina: Oh, my gosh, this is a good question for all of us. "In the Southern Hemisphere...  The sun rises in which direction?" It always rises in  the east. East is "C." Question number two...  Elisabeth: "True or false, the emu is the largest bird  in the world."  "The emu is the largest bird in the world."  Okay, true. Number three. I have to get back to the question. <br/>Rodger: Question three: "Heat cramps are caused by a  loss of: A: water; B: sugar..."  "Number C, salt, number D, protein." The answer  is C. Question number four:  Keith: "Australia's famous for its scary snakes. Of the ten most venomous snakes in the outback...  How many live in Australia?" Oh, my God. A: three, B: six, C: nine, D: ten." I have no idea. A? Number five: "If you are one mile from a lightning  strike...  Colby: "Approximately how long would it take to you  hear the thunder? A: one second, B: three seconds, C: five seconds, D: seven  seconds."  This sounds like it's backward to me. I'm going to say D: seven seconds. <br/>Jeff: Okay, ready for the results? First question: "In the southern hemisphere, the sun rises  in which direction?" Correct answer was C: East. Second question: "The emu is the largest bird on the  world." False. Ostrich. Third question: "Heat cramps are caused by a loss of... C:  Salt."  Tina: Oh, gosh. <br/>Jeff: Fourth question: "Australia is famous for its  scary snakes. Of the ten most venomous snakes in the outback--" key  word-- "...how many live in Australia?" Obviously, all ten. Last question:  ELISABEITH: Oh, my gosh. <br/>Tina: Gosh. <br/>Jeff: "If you are one mile from a lightning strike,  approximately how long would it take you to hear the thunder?" It's a  myth that it's one second. It is five seconds. All right, before I announce the winner, let's recap what you're  going to win. 30 minutes online with your family, $500 shopping spree,  courtesy of Visa, and for the rest of you, one final moment to say good-bye. Winning the reward with four correct answers-- Tina. <br/>Rodger: Okay! Go for it! <br/>Jeff: Congratulations, Tina. <br/>Tina: It feels good to win something, for heaven sakes! <br/>Jeff: All right, Rodger, you get one last good-bye. <br/>Rodger: You will not believe the things I have saw and  done. I love you guys. I told you I was going to... need those. <br/>Colby: She said, "I will fatten you up when you get  home. We all love you and miss you, and can hardly wait for you to be  home. Keep smiling and continue the adventure. Love, your mom."  Elisabeth: "Elisabeth, sorry we didn't come  through..." Don't be sorry. "We love you and we're so proud of you. We pray for you every day. Kisses and hugs."  Keith: I can only think of one important question that  came to me one night as a shooting star shot across the sky at some wee hours  of the morning: will you marry me, Peas? <br/>Colby: Oh, my gosh. Hope you were expecting something like this. <br/>Rodger: You did it. You did it. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my gosh! <br/>Oh, my God. "Will you marry me, Peas?" Oh, my God. Are you serious? <br/>Elisabeth: Can you imagine being on the other end of this,  though. <br/>Tina: Would you type that response again? I'm not sure I read that right. <br/>Keith: "Yes!" Yes! Yes. Yes! "You caught me off guard. I've missed you more than words can say. I'm sorry I missed the cues. It has been a long week. I love you and hope to see you soon. Yes!"  Tina: Congratulations, Keith. <br/>Elisabeth: Whoo, whoo! Wow! <br/>Jeff: All right, Tina. The throne is yours. <br/>Tina: Whenever I got on the computer, I could not type  fast enough. I said, "We won. Of all the things that I wanted to win, this was it. I wanted to talk to you all so much." I got a major rush  from getting to go talk to my family. And I thought that's enough to carry me through another eight  days, easy. I love and miss you all more than you will ever know, and I will  never ever go away again for this long. I thought, "Eight more days? Got it beat, girl."  Rodger: Best day out here. Rewards challenge, and we all won, every one of us. <br/>Keith: Everybody won today. <br/>Rodger: We all got to talk to our families back home. <br/>Colby: I mean, even in the rain... it's finally soaked  through my shorts and my boots. My feet are soaking wet, and I'm still... I have a grin on my  face. <br/>Tina: After I won my reward, the main emotion was sheer  joy. <br/>Elisabeth: Look at this, a little recreation going on. <br/>Colby: Nice! <br/>Tina: I mean my mouth hurt from just smiling the whole  time I was typing. Just the few words that we got to exchange between one another,  it was just sheer joy. <br/>Colby: Hey, Tina, Keith's going to say grace. <br/>Keith: Dear God, thank you for today. It was an incredible day. On a personal note, thank you for the "yes" from my  sweetheart, Katrin. And keep sending those prayers back home for loved ones to know  that we miss them. Keep them safe and continue to keep us safe in our last few  days. And we really thank you for this opportunity and the experience  we've had in the outback. Amen. <br/>ALL: Amen. <br/>Colby: I think it was apparent to everyone here that  today, at least for a day, strategy did not enter in our heads. And that probably won't be the case tomorrow. But today, we didn't care about winning a million bucks. <br/>Rodger: It's going to be a cold, cold night tonight. <br/>Tina: Colby, you're the candle blower outer. Good night, everybody. <br/>Keith: Good night. See you in the morning. <br/>Colby: Lights are out. Keith, are you ready? <br/>Keith: Yes, sir. [ thunder crashing]  Keith: Rodger and I are usually up the first time, you  know, before anybody. We had a bad night of rain, so anytime we have rain, we more  than likely lose our fire. Starting a fire in the morning is really very, very difficult. We were out just doing our morning bathroom break, and I looked  off to the horizon. I said, "What is that smoke over there?" We found an  actual piece of tree that was smoldering from a forest fire that was probably  two weeks old. God's giving us a present this morning on this cold, wet  morning. That was a huge find for us. It was the basis behind a great fire. <br/>Rodger: Do you believe that? I literally cannot believe that. <br/>Keith: You can see how a caveman learned about fire and  captured it, picked it up, brought it back to where he was at. <br/>Rodger: And that's how they started having weenie roasts. <br/>Keith: That was it. <br/>Tina: Looking at the river,  Keith: That was it. <br/>Tina: Looking at the river, it's running through our old  camp. That is truly amazing. <br/>Colby: Wow. From a material standpoint, we've lost a lot. I mean, we have our rice, and now that we know we have food, we  rationed the rice for the amount of days that we have left. <br/>Elisabeth: How much do we have left? <br/>Rodger: Two bags of brown rice and a bag of white rice. <br/>Colby: Keith is cooking way too much rice at every meal. All you've got to do is just make smaller servings and he  just... he can't get it through his head. <br/>Keith: This is where the game is really on right now. My intention is that I'll be here with Colby and Tina in the  last three. At this stage of the game, it's natural that political  campaigning is going on, especially with these last few individuals, because  they're your jury. I'm doing a lot more of the cooking now, now it's more oneon-one  dynamic, it's important to be able to do things that the other members of the  group see as a value. Let me try something on this-- a little experiment here. <br/>Elisabeth: Keith just said, "I'm going to do a little  experiment with the brown rice and white rice." I mean, our portions  were huge. And he said, "You know, I'm used to doing this sort of  thing. I can I assess how much we have." I think he just feels  awfully comfortable with the fact that he's going to be one of the final  three or two, and he knows the portion sizes will be bigger then. <br/>Colby: Isn't that rice cooked? <br/>Keith: Just cooked a little bit of it. It's okay, I blended it in with the white. The brown rice cooks up and expands so much more; gives you more  volume. <br/>Colby: Keith, you said the exact opposite five days ago. You said the brown rice yields less. <br/>Keith: No, I said you have to use more water. <br/>Colby: No, you said it yields less. You said it three times in a row. <br/>Keith: I said, if you don't use more water. <br/>Colby: Put half a cup ration. We decided on that and we have not stuck to it in the last four  meals. <br/>Keith: Colby...  Colby: I'm not going to do this ration thing again, where  we run out of rice, Keith. <br/>Keith: We're fine. <br/>Colby: We were... we're eating fine. <br/>Keith: Okay, we will be fine. I'll check it again, but I'm sure we're more than fine. <br/>Elisabeth: Check it right after we eat. <br/>Keith: Yeah, I actually checked it before we ate,  actually. The rice issue today was the first time I've seen Colby blow  up-- and it got me legitimately concerned, especially when Elisabeth was  right there, chiming in. I thought there's something going on here and I'm really in a  very vulnerable situation. <br/>Colby: We had 14 days worth of rice with 12 days left, and  we're now breaking even. <br/>Elisabeth: ...with the brown rice, which doesn't even  equal the white. <br/>Keith: No, it does equal. <br/>Colby: No, it doesn't, Keith. You're arguing yourself is what you're doing because you said  two times in a span of five minutes that brown rice does not yield the same  amount as white rice. <br/>Keith: I said you have to use more water to cook with. <br/>Colby: No, you didn't. He's a fool. The guy's a bozo, and I'm just tired of it. I'm tired of dealing with him. I don't take anything that Keith does for face value. I think there's an ulterior motive to everything he says and  everything he does, whether it's cooking rice or proposing to his girlfriend  on-line. I don't like the way he's playing the game. I think he's trying way too hard because he can't make it on  just being who he is. My game with Keith is done. It's over. <br/>Keith: The rice cakes worked beautifully. <br/>Colby: As far as what's wearing on me the most: time. The long days. That's the only thing getting to me, nothing else. And if it weren't for the long days, Keith wouldn't even get to  me. I mean, I wouldn't be as volatile as I am if it wasn't for the  boredom. <br/>Keith: Not unusual to sit and look at the fire for an hour  and just stare at the fire and the flames. <br/>Colby: Your fire becomes what's been referred to as the  "outback television." I mean, and that's what it is. That's your entertainment. You look and see how long an ember can burn or how long it takes  a log to burn in half to where it collapses. It's just one of those things. You color in a coloring book or you play a few games of  backgammon. Or you get into a conversation with someone that you forgot you  had three days ago. <br/>Tina: Make, like, red cardboard paper and then I put the  white doilies in the center. In my kitchen, in my dining room, we have hearts. You just have to walk through them all throughout the house. <br/>Colby: Cold, hunger, wet-- none of that can compare to the  boredom. It doesn't even fit in the same category, as far as I'm  concerned. <br/>Rodger: I literally cannot stand, like, to go up there and  just lay around in that hut for three or four hours, just drives me crazy. I said I got to get up and get out of here. I said I can't stay in this hut laying around. [ groans]  Colby: Rodger's always chipped in more than he's had to  with the tribe, whether it be fishing or boiling water. He's always up to do stuff. Being the oldest guy still here, he's got more energy than any  of us do, you know, and I think it comes from his heart. <br/>Rodger: Out by the bathroom, I found some more bark. <br/>Colby: Because we're not playing for ourselves now, we're  playing for those who are deserving to be here. Rodger and Elisabeth and Tina are all three deserving to be in  the final three. As far as Keith goes, there's not anything outstanding or  phenomenal that he's done that has kept him in the game. <br/>Keith: Immunity plays a huge part in this because immunity  could mean anyone can be along farther in the game. And at this point, anybody could win. <br/>Rodger: Up through here somewhere, the nearest path. Look at that. Five lanterns. And a log. Want to take it back up there before we open it? <br/>Colby: Yeah, let's do that. There's an old lock and the message reads like this: "Many  of the first settlers came as prisoners here. They'd escape into the outback, no water, no food, no beer. Your next challenge is a jail break. These lamps will light your way. And if you listen carefully, in the final four you'll  stay." I think it'll be fun. It'll be interesting. <br/>Keith: This will be a blast. <br/>Colby: Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Hey, guys. <br/>Colby: Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Hey, guys. <br/>Elisabeth: Hi, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: I'll start by taking the immunity necklace, since  you're shackled. Immunity back up for grabs tonight. Now, the reason you're shackled: the reason is because the first  settlers here in the outback were themselves prisoners. In a minute, I'm going to tell you a story about these  prisoners, and when I'm finished, you're going to use the information in that  story to free yourself. You're going to make your way through this abandoned cattle  station where there are eight different questions based on the story. Each correct answer to a question gives you a key, and that key  will open up any one of your five locks. However, if you answer the question wrong, you won't be able to  open the lock, and you must move on to another one of the eight stations. You continue making your way through the stations till you've  unlocked all five shackles. The first person back here completely freed carrying their open  shackles and their locks wins immunity. Okay, here's the story: the first settlers were prisoners  brought over here from Great Britain. Now, occasionally, a prisoner tried to escape, but the only  place they had to go was into an early grave because these escapees, known as  bolters, lacked one basic thing-- they lacked basic survival skills. Sun was their number one enemy. Temperatures can reach upwards of 110 degrees. You can live for 30 days without food. Dehydration will kill you in three days. Prisoners tried to fight this by taking off their clothes, which  exacerbated the dehydration process. And, in spite of how arid it is out here, a lot of sources of  water, if you know where to look. Same with food. You've tasted some of the food from the outback. Mangrove worms, even spiny leaf insects, which are a better  source of protein than the bigger lizards. You get tired of bugs and reptiles, bats will lead you to large  fruit that is colorless but edible. Birds will lead you to fruit that is pretty but inedible. Their sense of geography was so skewed that they thought China  and India were just around the corner, thinking China was only 150 miles from  Australia. Had they known some basic skills, they could have found their  way. For example, when visible during the summer months, the Seven  Sisters constellation shows you which way is south. So the conditions out here were very tough, but they weren't  insurmountable. Aboriginals have lived out here since 38,000 BC, which proves  that people can and do learn to survive. Now we're going to see what you guys have learned. Let's play. Survivors, ready? For immunity, go! <br/>Tina: The lock is killing my shin. <br/>Colby: "According to prisoner's flawed geography,  what country was just 150 miles from Australia?"  Keith: "How long have Aboriginal people been living  in Australia?" 40,000 years. <br/>Rodger: "In which season is the Seven Sisters  constellation not visible?" Summer. Dad gummit. <br/>Tina: Okay. "To avoid dehydration from the blazing sun, it's better  to...?" "Remove clothing, wear clothing." Okay... Okay. Come on. Get out. <br/>Elisabeth: "What was the slang for an escaped  prisoner?" Stepper. Oh, no, that's wrong. <br/>Colby: "When searching for fruit, it's best to follow  the..."  Rodger: "Pound for pound, which is a better source of  protein? Insect or lizard?" Insect or lizard? Insect or lizard? I'm going to go with lizard. [ sighs]  Tina: "Death by dehydration occurs how many times  faster than death by starvation?" Ooh...  Elisabeth: Come on. I guess not. <br/>Keith: Come on, come on, come on, come on. <br/>Rodger: "Death by dehydration occurs how many times  faster than death by starvation?" Five times. I thought that was the wrong answer. <br/>Elisabeth: "What country was just..."  Colby: "To avoid dehydration from the blazing  sun..."  Rodger: 20,000 years. <br/>Elisabeth: "To avoid dehydration from the blazing  sun..." Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. <br/>Keith: "How many times...?" Ten times. Come on. "When searching for fruit..." Bats. <br/>Tina: Is that not right? Guess it's not right. <br/>Keith: Oh, yes, come on, it should work. I need this. <br/>Jeff: Got them all? <br/>Keith: I don't know, I don't know. One, two, three. <br/>Jeff: Keith, that's just four. Got to have all five to win, bud. <br/>Keith: Shoot, where's my one lock at? <br/>Jeff: Got 'em? Let me see them. <br/>Keith: Damn it. <br/>Colby: Hands and ankles. That's it. <br/>Jeff: Immunity. <br/>Colby: Sweet, baby! <br/>Jeff: Got immunity: Colby. <br/>Keith: Damn! You beat me! <br/>Colby: What'd you forget? <br/>Keith: My lock, I lost a lock running with it. Good job. Good job. <br/>Jeff: Let me present this to you again. How many times in a row have you had immunity? <br/>Colby: Three times. <br/>Jeff: Three times, man. You are tough. <br/>Colby: Thank you very much. <br/>Jeff: You're safe tomorrow night. You four are vulnerable. I know you're a tight group. Part of the game. Head back to camp. I'll see you tomorrow night at tribal council. <br/>Rodger: I don't know what's tribal council. <br/>Rodger: I don't know what's going to happen at tonight's  tribal council. I got the impression that it would probably be myself and  Elisabeth, not necessarily in that order, would be the next two to be voted  off. Well, Tina mentioned which one I felt needed the money the  worst: myself or Elisabeth. I said I think Elisabeth probably does because of, uh,  Elisabeth's background and her mother being sick and what have you. And I just decided that I would take the out first for  Elisabeth. I was the chief executive officer in a bank for 12 years, so,  you know...  Tina: That makes me feel real good to hear. <br/>Rodger: Yeah. So Elisabeth's a nice young lady. I think about as much of her as I do a lot of members of my  family. I really do. <br/>Tina: I do, too. <br/>Rodger: Yeah, an awful sweet girl. When somebody's got medical bills-- here she comes. I really wouldn't want Elisabeth to know that I had done that. But Elisabeth and myself have become very close, and I've kind  of watched out for her. And that's basically it, really. Basically the reason. I'll share my seat there with you. I'm just sitting there, we're just sitting there yacking and I'm  so rude. <br/>Elisabeth: You are, Rodger. That's what I think of you, rude. <br/>Keith: Rodger just wanted it to be known that when it  comes to picking Elisabeth or himself to go first, he wanted to go first. But you don't know what's really going to happen. I could be voted off tonight and totally blindsided. <br/>Elisabeth: Tribal council is more up in the air than I  would have thought tonight. Colby supposedly was voting for Rodger, and I don't know if  Keith has driven him crazy enough that he'll vote for Keith. <br/>Tina: Everybody have their bag? <br/>Colby: The biggest struggle I deal with in the final few  tribal councils is whether I want to sit beside someone who almost guarantees  me the million bucks or whether I want to sit beside someone who, if I don't  win the million bucks, I'll still feel good about that other person winning. I don't even have my answer to that. I did yesterday, but it changed this morning and it'll change  again tonight. <br/>Jeff: We'll bring in the jury now. I'll once again remind you not to address the jury. As we wind down to six days left, certainly the information they  gather at tribal councils becomes increasingly significant. Keith, how big of an impact does daily life have at this point? You wake up in the morning with one idea of who you're going to  vote out tonight. By the time you get here, it's completely different. Is that plausible, possible? <br/>Keith: You know, you play a lot of mind games with  yourself. I mean, you are your own worst player at this stage of the game  because you're constantly second-guessing your thought process and, you know,  you're confident here and then you're not confident there, and... This game,  as I keep saying, "expect the unexpected" because... it's where it  is right now. <br/>Jeff: Is there a sense of paranoia that takes over? You see two people huddled in the corner, you think, "I  know they're talking about me, they're going to vote me out tonight." Is  that starting to happen? <br/>Tina: Absolutely. Whenever there's this few people left, and you think, "This  is closer than I thought and I could make it, you know? I've only got six days left." And then you see some people  whispering and you're like, "Oh, my gosh, I could go tonight." You  do. You start getting nervous and paranoid and then your whole day's  blown, you know, because you don't know what's going to happen. <br/>Jeff: 36 days you guys have spent together. Some relationships have formed, even ones I can see from the  outside. Elisabeth, tell me about the relationship with Rodger, because  you guys seem to have really connected. <br/>Elisabeth: Rodger is... I call him my "outback  daddy." He just really is. And from the moment I saw him, I knew that there was something  special. We've become friends. I feel safe with Rodger around, and Rodger's my man. I love him. <br/>Jeff: Rodger, how's it feel to have somebody say such kind  words about you? <br/>Rodger: Well, I'm very, very flattered. But I could very easily turn the tables back on Elisabeth. She's a fine young lady. Character-wise, morals-wise and she's tops in my book. <br/>Jeff: Keith, when you look at Colby with that immunity  necklace, knowing if you hadn't dropped one of your locks, you'd be wearing  it tonight, what goes through your mind? Do you care at all? <br/>Keith: You know, of course I wish I had it around my neck,  but that's the way the cookie crumbles. That was the way the game was played, and it was all fair, and I  dropped the lock, and it was my faux pas, and that's just the way it goes,  part of the game. What are you going to do? Can't cry over spilled milk. <br/>Jeff: All right, guys. 11 torches behind me, five left. Another torch is going to join that tonight. Let's vote. Elisabeth, you're up. <br/>Elisabeth: This is a great group, but, Keith, I think that  you've been a little overconfident and cocky about how you're going to be  here till the very end. <br/>Keith: Old buddy, I look forward to that home-cooked meal  in Kentucky. And if it's my time to go, I can't wait to see you on the  outside. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final. The person voted out of the tribe will be asked to leave the  tribal council area immediately. First vote... Keith. Rodger. Keith. Rodger. Two votes Rodger, two votes Keith. One vote left. Rodger. Need to bring me your torch, Rodger. <br/>Rodger: See you guys. See you, kiddo. <br/>Jeff: Rodger, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Grab your torches and head back to camp. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes to camp. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode and hear  what Rodger has to say. Next time on Survivor... Only four remain of Barramundi, and the  outback has taken its toll on all of them. <br/>Elisabeth: My hair is falling out. My hair is falling out. <br/>Jeff: And a surprise guest visits the remaining survivors. <br/>Elisabeth: Whoo-hoo! <br/>Tina: Welcome to Barramundi! <br/>Rodger: I was the oldest person getting off the plane, 53  years old. I've been out here 36 days and just had six more to go. I could've done without food for those next six days, if I'd had  to, to stayed out here. I wish them all the luck and I especially wish the best of luck  to Elisabeth. I hope she goes all the way. Thank you.
