<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," ben's alliance  was turning against him. <br/>Ben's got to go. <br/>I heard my name, so I got  to do whatever I have to do to keep myself in this game. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Ben made his target clear. <br/>You know what I’m doing tonight? I'm writing her name down. I'll say it. <br/>Jeff: Causing complete chaos. [all speaking at once] wow. In the end everyone voted for ben, but it didn't matter. <br/>I’m going to play this  for myself. This is a hidden immunity idol. <br/>Jeff: Ben sent Lauren to the jury. Lauren, the tribe has spoken. Six are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Wow. What a crazy freaking tribal council. <br/>Wow. <br/>That may have been better than my idol play. <br/>I am so excited. I can't believe that just happened. The only way I felt I could stay in the game is to turn everyone  on me and paint a target on myself and then use the id.L. And gets Lauren out. <br/>That's how you play an idol. <br/>No hard feelings, y'all. No hard feelings. Seeing six votes for yourself, and you pulling off the only  vote, getting to choose solely on who gets to go home, I mean, that's a good  feeling. Does anyone need water. <br/>No thanks. <br/>Okay. I'm going to go water. <br/>All right. Well, we all know who has to go next. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Can we just decide have that set. <br/>Did you know he had that? <br/>No. <br/>Nobody knew it? <br/>Nobody knew. <br/>We all wrote his name down. Why would we write his name down...  So listen, can we all decide, he's going home next, no  matter what. <br/>He's amazing. How do we not? He's really amazing. <br/>Coming back the camp after tribal, I felt like, if there  are "Survivor" Gods, that was a move by the "Survivor"  devil. That was messed up. I didn't want to see Lauren go home at all. <br/>I had no clue he had an  idol. <br/>I had no clue. I was floored. The guy's amazing. <br/>Which is why he has to go home. <br/>Can we all agree? <br/>No argument here. <br/>Here's the thing. One of us must win...  Because if any of us goes against him...  No, it's done. <br/>One of us must win immunity. <br/>Ben is still everyone's number-one target, but this game  is never as simple as you want it to be. As soon as I think, oh, I have this perfect plan, it's going to  be so easy, that's when things just turn upside down and everything goes the  opposite way and you have to devise this whole new plan and start over. <br/>We're going to get him. <br/>Voted out the wrong person, ben. <br/>What do you mean in  You should have voted me out. <br/>Because I ain't going to let you win immunity. I'm telling you right now. <br/>All right. I got Devon who is calling me out, and everybody is painting me  the bad guy, and, you know, I have no alliance anymore. <br/>Final six. <br/>Final six, guys. Congrats. <br/>So I got a long, hard road ahead of me now. <br/>So I got a long, hard road ahead of me now. Traditionally in "Survivor," once an idol is played,  it gets introduced back into the game, so I get up this morning, and the fire  is not going, and so I make a fire and kind of look around, and everybody is still  sleeping. There's not much wood, so I’m going to start looking for an idol  while I gather wood, you know? Idols are not easy the find at all. These forests and these jungles and these islands are huge, but  the last time I found one there was a rock that said dig on it. So I’m looking for something like that. I'm looking in trees, looking at rocks. I'm looking on the ground. I'm looking everywhere. <br/>So when I woke up this morning, Ben is gone. An I’m a little nervous because Ben is obviously looking for an  idol. But everyone now wants Ben out of the game. So to keep me safe for one more tribal, I am banking on the fact  that Ben will not find an idol again. I think he's already off looking for an idol. He's been gone about, I don't know, 45 minutes. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>My any time is dwindling here. And I know that. And I accept that fate. So I need the find an idol or win immunity to keep me in the  game, because I ain't going to quit until I’m out. Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. [ theme song playing] âª  Jeff: Come on in, guys. Shall we get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, you're going to be divided  into pairs. Each pair will be attached to a rope that is woven through a  series of obstacles. On my go, you'll race through the obstacles to the finish, where  you will attempt to land five rings on a target. First pair to finish wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: The winning pair will be taken by chopper to a private  resort on a private island where you'll enjoy lamb, chicken, lobster,  cocktails, chocolate mousse. <br/>Oh. <br/>Jeff: And then you will spend the night and sleep in a  bed. <br/>Whoa. Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: We'll do a random draw for pairs and we'll get going. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: Get it on. All right we randomly divided into three pairs. It is Ben with Ashley, Chrissy with Devon, and Ryan and Mike. Here we go for a nice reward. Survivors ready? Go! First you're going to launch your body over and under wood while  tethered to a rope. Ashley is over first. There goes Mike. <br/>We're tied up. We're tied up. <br/>Jeff: Mike and Ryan trying to coordinate that rope  management. Here comes Chrissy. Chrissy already hung up in the rope. Devon having to help her. Ashley with a big lead. There goes ben. People throwing themselves over. We are pretty even right now. Ashley and Ben with a bit of a lead. Chrissy and Devon right on their daily. <br/>Mike, Mike, hold on! <br/>Okay. <br/>You have to come back. <br/>Why? <br/>Because it's too tight. <br/>Jeff: Ryan and Mike now with a problem. Ashley with a nice move. It is Ashley first out. Ben right behind. Ashley and Ben have the early lead. Moving on to the second phase, you got to follow that rope  wherever it goes, you go. <br/>Go under, under, under. <br/>Jeff: Ashley is working through the obstacle quickry. No problem. Here comes Chrissy and Devon now right behind. <br/>I can't move. No Mike and Ryan stuck trying to figure out what's wrong. <br/>You got to go over again. <br/>Drew: They are falling out of this reward challenge early. It is now Chrissy and Devon on this second stage. 34 days in, everybody running out of energy. Ashley is through the second stage. Ben is through the second stage. They're moving on to the third stage now. <br/>Under? Under. <br/>Jeff: It is Chrissy and Devon trying to catch Ben and Ashley. Mike and Ryan finally through that first section. Chrissy and Devon now in the third section. Mike and Ryan have got to pick up the pace. You're still in it, guys. Lamb, chicken, lobster, sleep in a bed, private island. This could be a big boost for that next immunity challenge. <br/>Come on, Ryan. <br/>We're good. <br/>Jeff: Mike and Ryan quickly through that second section. Chris yes and Devon making up some time now. <br/>Keep going. <br/>Jeff: Once you figure out how to work that rope, you can  get a rhythm going. <br/>Keep going. No Ben and Ashley all tangled up. <br/>Don't get tangled. Perfect, perfect. <br/>Jeff: Mike and Ryan now picking up some time. They're back in this. We are dead even now between Ben and Ashley, Chrissy and Devon. <br/>Right behind you. <br/>Jeff: It is Chrissy finishing first. But she can't do anything until Devon gets there. <br/>Come on, Devon. <br/>Drew: Ashley and Ben are through. You guys are good on clips. Ben and Ashley moving on to the final stage. Start untying. <br/>You got it noosm Devon is through. You're good. Unclip. Mike and Ryan right on their tail. Ben has his rings free. Ben going to toss. Just misses. Five rings now, Ben and Ashley looking to hook them. Devon now has his rings free. He tosses and just misses. <br/>Let's go! <br/>Jeff: Unclip. Mike, you're good. Ryan you're good. Devon, two hands and scores. Def within first ring. Ben misses. <br/>We're right in this. <br/>Jeff: It comes down to a backyard game of ring toss for a  huge reward 34 days into "Survivor."  Go ahead. <br/>Jeff: Mike scores his first one. It would be a huge comeback for Mike and Ryan. Devon has the second for yellow. Blue with one. Red looking to get on the board and they do with that shot. Red now has one. Ben with a second. Ben scores the third for red. Ben is on a roll. Red now in the lead with three. Devon scores a third for yellow. We are tied three for red, three for yellow. Ryan's going to give it a shot. Blue scores again. Blue now at two for Ryan and Mike. Devon and Chrissy with three. Make it four for yellow. Def within the last ring could win it. No. <br/>Come on, ben. You got this. <br/>Jeff: Ben trying the keep them in it. No. Won't fall. Devon for the win... And he does it! Devon and Chrissy win reward. Chopper ride the a private resorten a private island. Nice feast and a good night's sleep. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Jeff: Devon and Chrissy, come on over. [applause]  Good job to, guys. <br/>Good job, y'all. <br/>Jeff: Here's the deal. Chopper will pick you up, take you the a beautiful private  resorten a private island, and the make it interesting, because it's "Survivor,"  there are four people left, choose one and only one person to join you. <br/>Can we discuss this? <br/>I think that Ryan would  be the best choice? No all right. You conferred. You made your decision. Who will join you on the reward? <br/>It's going to be Ryan. <br/>Jeff: Ryan, come on over. <br/>Thank you guys so much. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Ashley, you are looking like, wow, this is a  shocking decision. <br/>Shocking for one of them, not so shocking for the other,  so it's interesting who makes the decisions. I don't know. I guess you always hold on to that hope that maybe alliances  will pull through, but there is always other reasons for people's decisions. <br/>Jeff: Devon, Chrissy, Ryan, nice award awaits you. Could be a huge advantage heading into that next immunity  challenge. Grab you stuff, head back to camp, enjoy. Chopper will pick you up. <br/>Jeff:Ashley, you are still in  I wanted to go on this  reward to look for a clue to a hidden immunity idol, but Ashley is all  hangry, which is perfect for me. That's going to be the only way I start stirring stuff up. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>What did you say? <br/>That's a tough one to lose. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Overnight. <br/>I mean, why don't we all  just vent for five minutes. I was so pissed losing this challenge. I don't know why Devon and Chrissy didn't take me over Ryan. You would think that because I’m in the middle I would be  needed, unless Devon is trying to flip Ryan back to him, it's very fair to  think Devon could be the decideing factor. Ryan is the least deserving. That's youngest person, he has the most energy. He's 22 years old. I've been on the team with the kid twice now. The kid can't even keep a rope and a knot straight. Like so frustrated. <br/>Yep. <br/>These two are walking around like a bunch of crying  babies. They're hungry and tired and am I going the try the use that to  my advantage? Well, yeah, I mean, that's the only thing I got at this point. <br/>So where are your minds at then. Who would go next? <br/>Besides you? Ryan. <br/>Are you gunning for me, doc? Am I next out regardless? <br/>Honestly, I think you're one of the biggest threats in  your game. <br/>All you do is throw me under the bus all day every day. <br/>Isn't that what you would expect? <br/>No, no. <br/>I would think it's safe  to say everyone wants you out before the three. <br/>Well, if you can use my vote for something, let me know  because I don't want to go next. <br/>Mike wants me gone. He's going to be my next target. I'm hoping I’m going to be able to work with ash, but I got a  lot of work to do to keep my butt in this game. I don't trust doc at all. He's playing with you and Devon right now. <br/>I know. I know right where doc is at. But I also know right where you're at. <br/>Where am I at? <br/>You feel like you're at the bottom, and you're trying the  play who you. Can  Well, they're gunning for you and Devon  Who is? <br/>Chrissy and Ryan. <br/>They're gunning for me and Devon according to you. At this point Ben is saying that Devon and I don't have an upper  hand anymore, and I think that's true to a very large extent, but coming from  ben, I have to think about it like he's probably just saying that to just to  save himself. <br/>Oh, Ashley. You just make me laugh. <br/>Why's that? <br/>Because you basically told me there is nothing I can do to  talk to you then. <br/>Right. <br/>I don't get far with Ashley  trying the patch everything over with her is like talking to a brick wall. So I’m going to keep looking and trying to find this dang idol. <br/>I’m going to go get  water. <br/>Well, I know Ben is going to be looking for the hidden  immunity idol, but I searched the beach. I've searched the woods. I've searched the path. And I can't find the idol anywhere. So I’m not worried about Ben searching for the idol. There is no reason to keep following him around. Ben is not going the find another idol twice in a row as long as  he doesn't win immunity, which he's never done. I feel pretty confident ben's going home. <br/>Wow. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Look at that. Oh. <br/>Look at the view. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>Is that a mudslide? <br/>That is mousse. That's chocolate mousse. There's fruit, there's bread. There's everything. <br/>I could not be happier. I didn't think that it could get any better after I saw my dad. I love my dad, but coming to this private island, all you can  eat, all you can drink, and I didn't even win. They took me. It's without question one of the best moments of my entire life. <br/>So, guys...  Strategy? <br/>Yeah. <br/>You guys down? I think ben, number-one target. <br/>We have the get Ben out next. -longer that guy is in the game, the longer he could find an  idol. And then Mike, I don't know who he is playing. He could be playing me or he could be playing you. <br/>I think we're  underestimating him. <br/>He's dangerous. <br/>And he's pissed nobody off. <br/>I think the three of us,  because we play such different games, I would be willing to go to the final  three with you. <br/>Wow. In the become of my head, I was thinking about working with you  and Ryan. <br/>Chrissy brought up the idea of us three starting an  alliance and going to the final three together. Ryan was my closest ally, and then he was my number-one enemy,  but regardless of how unaligned we've been over the past few votes, I feel  like this is the perfect time to make a move, so I’m going with who I think I  have the best shot of going to the final three with and who I think I can  beat in the end. <br/>I would love to work with  you, and I would love to go to the end with Ryan after everything that's  happened, like...  It would be cool. <br/>Because we did tart this game together on day one. <br/>The relationship that Devon and I had was up and down, but  in the grand scheme of things, I’m closest with Devon and Chrissy, and I would  love to go to the final three with beth those people. <br/>I think this is the  perfect three, and I really do believe that everything happens for a reason. I just want the make it to the final three, and may the best  player at that point win. <br/>Although I don't know him well, having Devon on the final  three with me allows me the break up the Ashley-Devon alliance. <br/>Oh, my gosh, you guy, it's so gorgeous. <br/>Wow. <br/>Ashley was calling me out in front of our tribe, so if Ashley  wants me out, then I want her out. Final three. <br/>Final three. <br/>Final three. <br/>Cheers. <br/>On the other hand, Ben is a big threat, but he's not  attached to anyone, whereas Ashley right now has better relationships. So for my game, what may make more sense to vote off Ashley  first and then Ben next. Right now I don't know which way is best to go. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. Let's get to today's immunity challenge. First things first, Ashley, you know the drill. <br/>You can take it from me. <br/>Jeff: I can take it from you. You can win it back. <br/>That's right. <br/>Jeff: Once again immonti is back up for grabs. For today's challenge you're going the race through a series of  obstacles to a sack of sandbags. You'lls to as bag into a basket, releasing a set of ladder  rungs. You'll climb up, use the ball to release another set of ladder  rungs. When you get to the top, you'll solve a cog puzzle. First person to spin their cog puzzle raising their flag wins  immunity guaranteed a one in five shot at getting to the end. Losers, somebody will be voted out tonight and become the sixth  member of our jury. Big stakes on day 36. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. For immunity and a guaranteed spot in the final five, "Survivor"  -- Survivors ready? Go! You got to get up that ladder first. Then it's down the net. Ben is over. Devon. Big fall by Devon. Ben head-first through. Devon head-first. Everybody playing "Survivor" on day 36. Everybody wants this. Now you're untying knots looking for the sandbags. Whip through those knots. It is Chrissy bringing up the rear, but she's still in it. Once you have your sangtd bags out, start throwing them. You just need one bag in that basket. Devon tossingen Ben tossing. Mike tosses. There it is. Ashley off the an early lead now. Hit that ladder. Everybody hit their baskets at once. That is how you do it right now. Devon hits his. You're up. Let's go. Next phase now is the monkey bar. You are trying to release another set of ladder rungs. You're good, ben. It is mao Ben in the lead. Chrissy has hers. She's coming up. Mike has his. There comes Ryan. There's Ashley. Now you can start working on your puzzles. It is now Devon once again in dead last in this challenge. Devon is now up. Everybody now working on their cog puzzle. This could be a million dollar challenge for one of you. Nobody knows they're safe. The only way to be certain is to win immunity right here. Everybody covered in sawdust, trying to put together a very complicated  cog puzzle. There are more spokes than you need to use, but you need to use  every cog. When you're finished, it will turn and release your flag. That flag goes up, you win immunity. Ryan going the take pieces off and try something new. So many combinations. You don't know if it's right until you try to give it a spin. And then you'll find out. Ben moving pieces around. Chrissy moving pieces around. It was not that listening ago Chrissy was up here on this same  platform in our first challenge throwing up. Here we are 36 days later, she's still in the game with a shot  at winning it. Devon eyeballing. What do I need to do. Ashley moving very slowly with each piece. Mike taking his time, sitting down, no rush at all. Chrissy moving slowly and methodically. One piece at a time. Really watching to see all the pieces working together. Ben getting excited like he might have something. Chrissy now picking up the pace. Ashley picking up the pace. Ben now picking up the pace. This is it. This is where it is won or lost right here. 36 days gets you to this spot. And now you have another do-or-die to guarantee that you get to  day 37. You never give up on "Survivor." Chrissy thinks she  has it. And she does. Chrissy wins individual immunity guaranteed a spot in the final  five. <br/>Nice job, Chrissy. <br/>Way to go. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, come on over. Rights here. For the second time, individual immunity is yours. Safe tonight at tribal council. Can not be voted out of this game. As for the rest of you, it is so hard to get to day 36. The end is so close, and yet for one of you, you will not see  it. Tribal council tonight. Somebody will become the sixth member of our jury and it won't  be you. Congrats. Grab you stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>My whole plan was the try to win immunity is going into  tribal council either Ashley or Ben was available to be voted out. So I have to decide which one I want to vote out first. This is my time to be many control of the game. <br/>You killed that, Chrissy. <br/>Chrissy, the puzzle master. <br/>Way to go. <br/>Who knew you were good at puzzles. <br/>How exciting is that? Damn, friggin puzzles. <br/>That was super fun. <br/>That was my favorite challenge so far. <br/>Mine, too. <br/>Absolutely. This one hurts. This one hurts big time. I needed that one, because considering how last tribal went, I’m  100% sure everyone is targeting me tonight? <br/>Does anybody need water? <br/>But being marine, you never give up. I'm going to go look around this darn island for another idol. Those people are crazy for not following me. <br/>If we could just go to tribal right now that would be  great. <br/>Because we already know what's up. <br/>We all just vote Ben And move on. <br/>Is everyone on board with that? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yep. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Who is Ben voting for? <br/>I don't know. <br/>Tonight it would be nice to f we could get in, everyone  vote for Ben and get out. Because last tribal it was pretty shocking to see him whip out  that idol. I don't think Ben has an idol, but he's the most likely person  to find one. <br/>I don't think he has an  idol  You never know. <br/>It's scary if it did, it would take one vote. <br/>If he pulls an idol, he's a freakin' man. <br/>Should we take the chance and split it between Mike and  ben? <br/>They don't expect that? Let's this that. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>Ashley's plan is to split the votes for Ben and Mike, see  if minute plays the idol, and if no one plays the idol, then vote out ben. But I would actually like to vet Ashley out first, because she  is the one that I trust the least, and I know she's gunning for me to be out. So I've got to get rid of her. <br/>I feel the same way about  Ashley as I feel about ben, which is like get her the hell out of this  freaking game. This is what I would like to do. I want to send home Ashley. I want to convince Ben that he's going home and have him gone. Everyone wants him out there. Are two more tribals before final three. He's not going to win both. <br/>I feel like we have an  opportunity to get him out, get him out. <br/>There is a frosty that I keep... That transcends this  game. And that just makes me nervous. If I had my druthers, it would go ben, Ashley out. <br/>That's what I would say, too. <br/>Okay. I just don't know what I’m going to do, but I seriously may make  a late game-changing decision based on my gut at tribal. <br/>I really like Ashley, and  now Chrissy starts pitching this idea of getting rid of Ashley before ben,  which is just crazy to me, because Ben is dangerous. He has made big moves, and if Ben is in the final three, none of  us stand a chance. <br/>Looking around, and I peeng around a tree, and I see a  purple box with a black arrow pointed down. No way! No way! Oh, my gosh. <br/>There is nothing more valuable than being safe at tribal  council. The immunity idol is tied to the underside. You have to be clever. No way! No way! I found it. I found the dang clue. Oh, my gosh. I got the map to the idol. On it is a picture of our bed. And it has an x on the bed, so I’m pretty nervous, because it's  in plain sight of everybody. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. I'm hoping that nobody back at camp...  Yes! <br/>I get back the camp, and Ryan,  Devon, and Mike are at the fire. I don't know how I’m going to pull this off. <br/>Cranberry bagel. <br/>I've had the cinnamon swirl. <br/>It's not that good. A jersey big ale is so much better. <br/>Toasted with cream cheese, it's good. <br/>It's small, too. <br/>No, it's not. <br/>Yes, it is. <br/>If I start digging around the base of the bed and pull out  a purple thing, everyone is going to know what that is. <br/>I don't know how much  time we have left. <br/>I don't know, but I’m hungry. <br/>I don't know how much  time we have. <br/>Time is running out. I can't see nothing. Everybody in this camp wants me gone, but if I can find the  idol, I can blow up this whole game, so I’m not going anywhere until I get  that idol. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Desi, Cole, JP, Joe, and Lauren voted out at the last tribal  council. So, ben, last tribal council you played an idol, survived the  vote. Was there any impact back at camp after the tribal? <br/>I don't think it's  changed for anyone here. I think I’m still the number-one target. These two are a nice tight-niche group. These two are a nice tight group. Mike is the swing in between that, so it's tricky as heck for  me. I'm trying the stay in this dang game. <br/>First thing you said is these two pointing to Ashley and Devon  are a tight couple. Yet, Ashley, you weren't chosen for the reward an you were  clearly upset. <br/>Yeah, me and dev, we have a friendship. I thought maybe he would pick me, but it wasn't just Devon's  choice. It was also Chrissy's choice, and I got the strategy behind her  game play. <br/>I thought her comment,  "Well, we know who makes the decisions, was poor sportsmanship. <br/>I did not mean it like  that. It's a group decision. If it's just Devon, we're buddy, Devon would pick me. <br/>Jeff: Mike, how important is it to see the big picture, to  say I cannot look at tonight's vote. I have to look at the end and start working backward. <br/>Right. Ben is clearly the biggest threat in this game. That doesn't mean he's the only threat. When you start looking at it from an individual game, it's not  just about getting to the final three, it's about getting to the final three  with people you can trust, and at the end of the day, people you can beat. <br/>And however many offers you have to the final three, you  need the start checking, do I want to be in the car with this person or this  person? Do they want to be with me is the more important question? It's the most powerful offer the final three, but it has the  most lucrative contract negotiations in that this may not even have happen. <br/>What's funny about the offer is that basically it's  telling you, you think you can beat me, so you want to go with me. <br/>Precisely. <br/>Jeff: Devon, do you have a final three? <br/>Yes, I do. <br/>Chrissy, do you? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Mike? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Ashley? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Ryan, you have a final three? <br/>Is the pope catholic? Yes. So five of you have final threes. <br/>Yeah, the math makes sense. <br/>Jeff: Ben, do you have a final three... Any of them. You know, I’m the lone wolf, and I’m open for business. I'll take two of any of you with me. <br/>Jeff: Mike, at what point does ben's offer actually become  valuable, because after tonight, there's only five people left. <br/>The problem is Ben has told so many things that are not  true to so many people at this point. And I really believe that "Survivor" is not just about  blind sides and lying the people and tricking people, it's played between  those blindsides. You can build trust with people, and you can play a good game. But at the same time, Ben is very smart, and Ben is very tricky. I could see him getting his way tonight. Right? Ben is a player. <br/>Jeff: Ashley, you reacted when Mike said that. <br/>Yeah, I mean, if somebody switches tonight on what I think  is going to happen tonight, then that's just another blind side for me that I  wasn't part of, so that leaves me to question, oh, is there plan that I don't  know about. <br/>Jeff: Ben, that's what you're hoping for, is that people  start to question and doubt the people they're left with. <br/>Exactly. But it's hard playing the game with people who aren't willing to  make big moves and move forward in the game. And we're at a point in the game where resumes are going to  start getting looked at. Coasting along might get you to the end, but it's not going to  get you the $1 million. These guys need the start making some power moves. <br/>A power move being a mind side, being able to --  Hasn't every vote been a blind side  And what did you help with those? <br/>Why would I tell you everything about my game? <br/>Eventually you'll have to tell me. <br/>If you want to know my resume, I can tell you when you're  over, there but until then you should be happy to be here. <br/>Well, thank you, Devon, for keeping me in this game. <br/>Jeff, I don't necessarily think we need to wear our games  on our sleeve either. <br/>Especially with someone you're not aloned with and you  don't trust. <br/>Jeff: So when you hear ben's comment, does it rattle you a  little? No, not at all. I don't think Ben knows what he's talking about. And I truly think ben's going home tonight. <br/>Hey, Jeff, should we just church this up and get to the  point. We'll just get to the point here. Because I’m not going home tonight. Secret, secret, secret. [make explosion noise] paragraph I think that's more extreme  than it needs to be. To make like it's this mass explosion at tribal is exaggerated. I don't think that Ben just necessarily blew up the intergame. I think it's just a little ridiculous. That's all. <br/>Oh, lordy. <br/>Jeff: Wow, Ryan? <br/>The Ben bomb is dropped again, right? The biggest twist in the game, an unknown idol just came back  into the game from a guy who is potentially getting votes. <br/>But everyone remember that just because it's around his  neck right now doesn't mean he's going to play it. <br/>Ashley, do you think there is any chance that Ben might  not play it? <br/>If I were ben, I would play it. You know, just because it's... Sorry, I’m a little lost for  words right now. <br/>You want to go back to camp with me. <br/>Do you have a suggestion? <br/>Sure. What you got? <br/>You want to go back to camp with me? <br/>What? Bell, I’m feeling like you might in the play that. <br/>I’m in the final five. <br/>Okay. There we go. Good work. <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. He's playing it early as a sign of power, maybe faith. I'm in the sure. How does this change things. We know if you cast a vote for ben, it won't count. <br/>It's a lot of confusion because everybody had set plan,  but somebody's plan is going to be changed tonight, it's just a matter of  whose plan is going to be changed. <br/>Jeff: Mike, how unsettling is this, because there is  nowhere to hide. <br/>Ben has fast forwarded past the vote, and all of this  stuff is coming like 1,000 miles a minute. But this is a game of "Survivor," and even sometimes  your most trusted allys have to go home. No ben, why are you ?Ielg? <br/>This is awesome, Jeff. I've just turned five against themselves and got me one more day  in this game. So mission accomplished. Ryan, you're up. Ryan, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. Ben has played his idol. If anybody else has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play  it, now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. First vote, Mike. Ashley. Ashley. Two votes Ashley, one vote Mike. Ash limp that's three votes Ashley, one vote Mike. <br/>I can't believe this. 13th person voted out and the sixth member of our jury, Ashley. <br/>You guys are crazy. <br/>Jeff:  That's four, that's enough. You need to bring me you torch. <br/>I'll see ya. <br/>Okay. Ouch. <br/>Jeff: Ashley, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Time for you to go. <br/>Thank you. Good luck, guys. <br/>By, ash. <br/>Bye, Ashley. <br/>Jeff: Well, congratulations. You have made it to the final five. And this season as much as any other it is not been easy getting  to the final three will be even tougher. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Captioning funded by cbs and ford.

Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org  Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on the season finale of "Survivor,"  only five are left. <br/>This is where it gets tricky. <br/>It's crazy it's coming down to this. <br/>No matter what you expect, something else is going to  happen. <br/>This game could blow up yet again. <br/>Jeff: The final secret advantage of the game. Who will outlast all the rest and claim the title of sole Survivor? Join us for the live finale and aftershow. <br/>36 out of 39 day, I couldn't have gotten much closer than  that. Devon completely went against the alliance we had. I think there are hard feelings still for the moment, but I did  a lot better than I ever would have imagined. This whole experience has given me a brand-new outlook on life,  and I couldn't be more grateful than that.
