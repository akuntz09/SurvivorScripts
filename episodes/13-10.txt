<br/>JEFF Probst: previously on Survivor...  It's every man for himself. <br/>Probst: Brad's comments made Raro suspicious. <br/>I don't know what's going on with Brad. I lost my trust with him. <br/>Probst: While at Aitu...  As much as everybody is saying, "Let's stay together with the six,"  it's going to get ugly. <br/>Candice and Jonathan conspired to turn against their alliance at the first  sign of a merge. <br/>I am determined to not be the guy who made the move too late. <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge... I'm offering each of you the opportunity  to mutiny and join the other tribe. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Probst: If you want to move, step off your mat and join the other tribe. Three, two... Candice is mutinying. One. Jonathan mutinies at the last second. Candice and Jonathan betrayed Aitu, leaving them with only four members. Go! But in a dramatic twist, the underdog Aitu tribe claimed victory... Aitu wins  reward! ...and sent a message to Candice by banishing her to Exile Island. <br/>Aitu. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Probst: The reward brought the Aitu four closer together. <br/>The mutiny solidified our commitment to each other. We're a team to the end now. <br/>Probst: At Raro...  Took a step into the unknown, guys. <br/>Probst: ...Jonathan tried to fit in with his new tribe, but quickly became  the outsider. <br/>To really think we all have your back after we saw you sell out your other  tribe? Are you dumb? <br/>Probst: Go, go, go! At the immunity challenge, the Aitu four sank Raro in another upset win. Aitu wins immunity! On the other side of the coin... Raro, tribal council tonight. Before tribal council, Jonathan tried to prove his worth by working hard. And Candice reconnected with Adam and tried to distance herself from Jonathan. <br/>Probst: But at tribal council... Brad, do you trust these people in this  tribe now? <br/>Absolutely not. <br/>Probst: ...Brad dug his own grave. The ninth person voted out, and the first member of our jury. Brad, the tribe has spoken. 11 are left, and the jury has its first member. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Who knew a Jew could climb a tree and get coconuts and pandamas nuts and  scallops and clams alone in the wilderness? I'm the wandering Jew without a tribe. I'm living a mutineers' life, man. I'm on the outside. I've made the game much harder for myself. <br/>Thanks. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>I regret jumping. I mean, it was an impulsive thing. But I hope in the long run it turns out to be a good thing. <br/>So are you excited to be back? <br/>I'm so excited. I mean... you know I trust you. <br/>So we've got to keep that, because you and I are going to be the end. That's what we're doing. <br/>Good. I took a big step to switch tribes, and I'm, you know, completely out of  everything that's going on. <br/>But you and I are going to the end. <br/>All right. From the very beginning, I feel like Adam is a very straightforward person. So I do feel lucky to have somebody in the game that I can trust right now. <br/>Everyone knows that you and I are pretty close. And Jenny is the only issue. She's probably worried that I'm going to be with you, which I am, and we've  got to, like, not let her think that. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Probably want to make babies and have a house with a white picket fence. They're like the all-American couple. <br/>Yeah, I know. <br/>If we stick to our five-- Nate, Parvati, Rebecca, Adam and myself-- we'll get  far in this game. Candice, I'm a bit leery about, because I know, in the original Raro tribe,  that Candice and Adam had a little attraction. So I'm a little worried about that, because we don't want Adam to falter, and  make sure that he stays secure with our group-of[1]five  alliance. <br/>I trust you completely, but everything else is like a crapshoot. <br/>Exactly. <br/>That hurt? <br/>Thank you. <br/>Feel better? <br/>And this one, yeah. <br/>This one? <br/>And I cut my finger. <br/>Where? <br/>Right here. <br/>And I cut my lip right here. <br/>Did you? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Did you? <br/>Feel better? <br/>Yep. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION  You know, we're deep inside of a hole. We're three people behind at this point, and we're being tested in a way that  few survivors have been able to come out of. It's an incredible opportunity. To be the underdog is amazing, and I'm happy, totally happy, to be the  underdog. <br/>Tree mail! How well do you guys know your nautical flags? No letter, just this. <br/>Whoa. <br/>So I don't know if we have to memorize all of these. <br/>Tree mail was basically a code. <br/>Red, white, and blue vertical stripes. <br/>Red, white, blue, that is "T."  So we're fiercely cramming. <br/>"S" is the squares with the gray in the middle. <br/>For us, we don't really have any strategic options other than to win. We are the underdogs. All we have to do is our best. We have to work together. We have to be a team. If we're not, we're screwed. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Come on in, Raro. Aitu getting your first look at the new Raro tribe. Brad voted out at the last tribal council. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Probst: One bit of news that I need to share with Aitu. When Brad became the ninth person voted out, he also became the first member  of the jury. <br/>Whoa. <br/>Probst: Okay, guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yep. <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: Two tribe members armed with a compass and coordinate will race out  to a large 16-point compass rose to locate treasure chests buried under the  sand. Each chest has the next coordinate painted on the top. When you find a chest, race back to your mat. The next two tribe members, with that new coordinate, will race out to get  another chest. Once you have all four chests back on your mat, untie the chest and remove  seven wooden nautical flags. Remembering that the flags represent letters of the alphabet, you will match  the correct flags with the corresponding letters on the board to spell the  word "Victory." First tribe to get it right wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: The winning tribe will be flown to a nearby island and take part in  an umu, which is a local feast. <br/>Yeah, baby. <br/>Probst: Pork, lots of fruit, home brew, which is similar to wine, made  locally, thus the name, home brew. In addition the winning tribe will choose one member from the losing tribe to  go to Exile Island. Raro, you have three extra members. You're sitting three people out. Who's going to sit this one out? Rebecca, Nate, and Parvati. Take your spots, wait for my go. Both tribes have their compass. Raro, your first coordinate is north-northwest. Aitu, your first coordinate is east-northeast. For reward. Survivors ready? Go! Yul and Sundra out first. Jonathan checking north before he heads out. <br/>Right here, right? <br/>Probst: Aitu digging for their first chest. <br/>North by northeast. <br/>It's north-northwest. <br/>It's north by northeast. <br/>North-northwest. <br/>Probst: Raro already having a dispute. Are they in the right spot? <br/>North-northwest. <br/>Just dig. <br/>Probst: Yul and Sundra found their first chest! <br/>Yes, yes, yes, yes. <br/>Man, come on! <br/>What is this digging like that? Help him. Help him, Jenny! <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>Probst: Aitu making good progress. They can see the chest. They've just got to get it out of the sand. Jonathan and Jenny now have an eye on their first chest. <br/>Come on, guys, get that thing up! <br/>You guys got it. <br/>Probst: Yul and Sundra coming back with their first chest. <br/>Coordinate, coordinates. <br/>North by northwest. <br/>North by northwest. <br/>Probst: Jonathan and Jenny have their first chest. <br/>East. East. East-southeast. <br/>East-southeast. <br/>That's it, that's it. that's it. <br/>Probst: Ozzy and Becky have a line on their second chest. <br/>East south...  Southeast. <br/>No, no. <br/>East-southeast. Right here. <br/>This is southeast. <br/>Probst: Adam and Candice confused, losing time for Raro. Ozzy and Becky back with the second chest for Aitu. Aitu leads 2-1, big reward on the line. <br/>Damn, we stink. <br/>Yul and Sundra out now, digging up their third chest for Aitu. Adam and Candice have found the second chest for Raro, finally. <br/>Come this way. <br/>Probst: They've been at this chest a long time. Raro has lost all momentum. Yul and Sundra have their third chest out for Aitu. Aitu leads three chests to one. <br/>West-southwest. <br/>Probst: Ozzy and Becky now looking for that fourth and final chest for Aitu. Adam and Candice have the chest out. <br/>Run, run, run. <br/>Southwest, southwest, southwest. <br/>Probst: Got to get back to the mat. No! Got to get back to the mat. Jonathan and Jenny back on the course now, looking for their third chest. <br/>West-southwest. Southwest. <br/>Probst: Ozzy and Becky have found their fourth chest. Big reward on the line. Losers, somebody going to Exile Island. <br/>Come on, guys, keep digging. <br/>The hole's coming. <br/>They're on their last chest. We've only got two. <br/>Probst: Jonathan and Jenny now have an eye on their third chest. <br/>Dig around it, Jenny! Dig around it! Dig with both hands, both hands! <br/>I don't want to bury it with my other hand. <br/>I don't understand. <br/>Probst: Jenny just pushed more sand back in the hole. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Stand up. Use your legs! <br/>Use your legs to pull it up! <br/>We're trying! <br/>Probst: Ozzy and Becky have found their fourth and final chest for Aitu. <br/>Everyone take a box. <br/>Damn it! <br/>Probst: Jonathan and Jenny still working on their third chest. Aitu now working quickly to untie all four chests and remove the flags. <br/>Who's having trouble? <br/>I'm having trouble. This one is really tight. <br/>Probst: Very little sand coming out of that hole. Aitu now pulling out the flags. Those flags will spell one word. <br/>Come on. I'm going to go to exile. <br/>Probst: Jonathan and Jenny, they've unearthed the third chest for Raro. <br/>South-southwest. <br/>Probst: Got to get back to the mat. <br/>Get on the mat, get on the mat. <br/>Probst: Go! Adam and Candice now looking for that fourth chest. Aitu has all the chests open. They have all of their flag pieces. Adam and Candice like slow motion over there. <br/>Come on, both hands, guys! Dig in! <br/>Probst: Aitu working together quickly trying to solve the puzzle. <br/>Oh, my god, how do we keep doing this? <br/>Probst: Aitu getting very close. <br/>I don't believe it. <br/>"V-i-c-t-o-r-y."  Probst: The new Aitu tribe win said their third challenge in a row. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Oh, my god. Where are they? They don't have the fourth box. <br/>Probst: Aitu, congratulations on another victory. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: First order of business-- you must now send one person from Raro to  exile island. <br/>One, two, three-- Candice. <br/>Probst: Is this from the same betrayal? <br/>Betrayal, strategy-- at this point, same thing. <br/>Probst: Candice, you just got back from exile. You're heading right back there. Boat will pick you up in time for the next immunity challenge. Aitu, we've chartered a plane for you. You will be flown to an island where the feast is awaiting you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Grab your stuff, head on down the beach. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Thank you, Jeff! <br/>Today, I did not want to be sent back to Exile Island. But I know it will be okay. Sea cucumber-- so disgusting. It's not fun to know that people that you like want to see you suffer. I can survive out here. It's tough, but hopefully this is a character-building experience. <br/>I really believe that our tribe deserved this adventure, because we're up  against these amazing odds. And we come into the challenges humble, knowing that we can only try our  hardest, and that's all we can do. ( speaking a foreign language )  At first, this very dignified man in his costume, and all these feathers, you  know, comes out and starts, like, yelling. You know, almost like we had done something wrong, you know, like this very  commanding voice. Obviously we don't understand, so, you know, the most we could do was just  stand and wait. ( chanting in a foreign language ) ( singing in a foreign language )  Basically, it was a warrior's welcome. That's part of their culture. And we were warriors that just came out of a fierce battle. It was incredible. And it was nothing that we ever expected in our imagination. ( chanting in a foreign language ) ( cheers )  I didn't know I would ever be a part of something this beautiful in my life. It was magnificent-- the people welcoming us, how we felt after winning the  challenge, you know, the four orphans that have to stick together, and we  triumphed once again. I can't even describe how that felt. <br/>Thank you. <br/>So good. Oh! This is so good! I was incredibly grateful for the islanders reaching out and, you know, being  such wonderful hosts. <br/>Whoo! Aitu! <br/>It was fun. You know, I got to say, probably the first time since I've been here where I  really felt really carefree and just enjoyed myself. <br/>Yul's a very complex, very, very intellectual guy. To see him come out of his shell was amazing. Man, that guy can dance. I didn't know he had it in him. You know, at this point in the game, we've gone from being separated into all  of our same ethnicities. Now we're all able to come together and experience a totally new culture. And we carry a piece of their spirit with us into the next challenge. Raro doesn't know what's coming. <br/>My tribemates all want to chill. Haven't yet seen that whatever they're doing isn't working, and maybe they're  just demoralized from losing. But the reason we've been losing is these have not been a tribe yet. They do not work together. And I realized if it was ever going to work, slowly but surely give them an  example of another way to be in the tribe. And that is you work your ass off all the time. <br/>Got some fish? <br/>Dude, I got so many freaking fish. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11. <br/>It looks like you went to the store and just bought...  Yeah, right? It's funny. I'm getting the hang of it now for sure. These folks need to trust me. I need to help them out. I can continue to try to do what I'm doing and have them say, "Oh, well,  at least somebody's working. Can't get rid of him because at least I'm eating thanks to him." I like  it. I don't know. We'll see. <br/>All right, ladies. Tree mail. <br/>Another map. <br/>"Any explorer knows to study about where he goes. Disappointment shows, and for the losers, the tribal council lows."  Just learn the islands. We got a whole map of the islands of the Pacific, assumingly to study. <br/>Rebecca, you need to really learn it. Right? Does that make sense? <br/>There hasn't been one challenge where I feel that Rebecca has been a strong  force to help our tribe win. <br/>I can help you. <br/>Okay, help me. <br/>Solomon drives solo, because there's one little guy that sticks out. Solo. So it goes... Am I confusing you? Should I go in order? <br/>So I don't know how Rebecca is going to fare from this point on if she  doesn't show a little more in challenges. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. We'll now bring in Candice returning from Exile Island. <br/>Hey, guys! Miss me? <br/>Yeah! Miss us? <br/>Maybe just a little bit. <br/>Welcome back. <br/>Probst: So Candice, since the infamous mutiny, you've spent three days and  nights on Exile and less than 24 hours with your new tribe. The isolation has to be having some impact on you. <br/>Well, I mean, I'd rather be with my tribe, but I trust that they know that  I'm, you know, staying strong out there, and they're staying strong for me  back at camp. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: First things first. Yul, I'll take back the immunity idol. Immunity is back up for grabs. In tree mail, you once again received information vital to today's challenge. I have faith that you studied it. On my "go," you will swim out one at a time to a pontoon. You'll dive down and unclip a bundle of island names and swim back to shore. Then the next person goes. Once all four tribe members are back, you will move to an answer table where  you must correctly identify ten islands by matching the islands with the  island names you just collected. First tribe to answer correctly, you'll go back to camp with the immunity  idol. Losers go to tribal council. You will not, however, leave empty-handed. The losing tribe will take back to camp with them this bottle. Inside it is a note. It must remain sealed. The note contains significant information. You will bring it with you to tribal council. You will open the bottle after you have voted. Raro, you have three extra members. At the last challenge, Nate, Parvati, and Rebecca sat out. You three are participating. Who is the fourth person who is going to join you? <br/>I am. <br/>Probst: All right, take your spots at the start. Wait for my, "go." Here we go. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! Ozzy and Nate in the water first. When you reach the pontoon, you've got to dive down and unclip. Ozzy already up with the island names and heading back. <br/>Man! <br/>Probst: Nate at his pontoon. Nate didn't get it the first time. Raro quickly falling behind. Nate has it, heading back for Raro! <br/>Yeah! Come on, buddy! <br/>Probst: Ozzy back for Aitu with the first bag of island names. Yul heads out for Aitu. Raro's going to have to make up some time. Nate is exhausted swimming back. <br/>Come on, Nate! Kick it, buddy, kick it! <br/>Probst: Yul dives down for Aitu. <br/>Come on, Yul! <br/>Probst: Yul up quickly with the second bundle of island names for Aitu. Nate coming back to shore. <br/>Good job! Good job! <br/>Probst: Jonathan heads out for Raro. Becky heads out for Aitu. Aitu has two bundles of island names. Raro with one. Jonathan up quickly with the island names and swimming back. <br/>Go, Becky! <br/>Probst: Becky slowing down. <br/>Come on, Becky! A little bit farther. <br/>Probst: Jonathan back to shore with the second bundle of island names for  Raro. <br/>Go! <br/>Probst: Parvati heading out now for Raro. Parvati a strong swimmer, trying to make up time now. <br/>Swim, baby, swim! <br/>Probst: Becky is up with the third bundle of island names for Aitu. Parvati has the third bundle for Raro. Raro is catching up. <br/>Come on, Becky! <br/>Push, Becky, push! <br/>Probst: Sundra heads out for the fourth and final pontoon. Parvati worn out. <br/>Run! That's it, that's it! Nice job! Nice job. Go, Rebecca! <br/>Probst: Rebecca heading out. Sundra can't get it on the first time down. <br/>Go, Rebecca! <br/>Probst: Rebecca has reached the fourth pontoon for Raro. Sundra has the fourth bundle of island names for Aitu. <br/>Come on, Sundra! You've got it. <br/>Probst: Rebecca does not come up with the bundle. <br/>Come on, Rebecca! <br/>Good job! Come on, baby! <br/>Come on! <br/>Probst: Aitu, start solving it. <br/>Probst: Rebecca has the fourth bag for Raro. <br/>Come on, baby! <br/>Probst: Aitu already at work solving the puzzle. <br/>No, no. Guam is up here. <br/>No. <br/>Stand up! Stand up! <br/>Probst: Rebecca getting close to the shore. <br/>That's it, baby! Run, now run! <br/>Probst: Aitu very close. <br/>Okay. Ready, and untie! <br/>Probst: Raro now working on the puzzle. Aitu thinks they have it. Stop working, Raro. Stop. Aitu wins immunity! <br/>Good job, guys. Good job. <br/>Probst: Aitu, congratulations on your fourth straight win. Safe from tribal council once again. Raro, we have a date at tribal council. And you have a bottle. The bottle is sealed. You will take it back with you to camp. Bring it to tribal council. You will open this bottle after the vote. Candice, grab your stuff. Head on back to camp. <br/>What's in that little bottle that Jeff gave us? <br/>I think individual challenges but no merge, or something weird like that. Or, like, we have to live on the same beach, but no merge. Once we lost immunity, there was a little twist that whoever had to go to  tribal tonight was going to get this bottle with a message in it, and we  couldn't open it until after the vote. <br/>I'm interested to hear what's in that bottle. <br/>I bet it says we have to, tomorrow morning, get up and go to the other  tribe's island for breakfast and merge. <br/>I have this feeling of, like, dread, like I don't want to open it, I don't  want to know, because it's going to be something really bad. But who knows? <br/>There's nothing happening. <br/>Based on overall performance, productivity around camp, and performance  during challenges, we're going to have to break up our five-team alliance and  send Rebecca home today. <br/>I think it's good that Rebecca goes today. <br/>Yeah, I think that's good, too. <br/>Then after that, I don't know. <br/>Do you think that will... she can get that to happen? <br/>Jenny becomes a threat, and we really have to worry about Jenny after this  vote. At that point, she's going to really try to get Candice off. She's worried that I wouldn't vote Candice out, which is true. So Jenny might be the next one to go. <br/>He's a cool guy. But I wouldn't turn on any one of our original members for him. That's not fair. We've gone through too much together, you know. Even though there are times where I wonder about certain individuals. The tribe's consensus is to vote for Rebecca. She's our weakest link. But I would say maybe Jonathan right now, just because of the fact that he's  not family. You know, we want to keep it Rarotonga as much as we can. It's kind of a... it's a weird vote tonight. <br/>We've got three good-looking fish here. <br/>Yeah, man. <br/>Beautiful. <br/>Yeah, baby. I believe they're going to vote Rebecca out. I believe. I hope. And through a frickin' lot of hard work on my part the last couple of days, I  think I have earned at least the right to one more night. <br/>I'm really curious about that note. <br/>Is it after the vote? Is it after the... after the results are read? <br/>After the vote. <br/>But who knows? We don't know. Who knows what it's going to say. <br/>It's going to be something bad. If it was something good, wouldn't they give it to the winning tribe? <br/>Probst: we'll now bring in our jury. Brad, voted out at the last tribal council. Brad is here to observe. You're not to direct anything to him. He's merely here to listen. Okay, as a tribe, you guys have won three challenges. Jenny, what can you do to change something within this tribe? <br/>I wish I knew the answer. I still can't pinpoint it. I think it goes back to analyzing our strengths and weaknesses. I don't know. I mean, from now, I guess we just have to wait and see. <br/>Probst: Rebecca, let's talk about what's going on at camp. What goes on? Fishing? <br/>We know we have to move forward and we have to stay as positive as we  possibly can, so everybody goes out clamming, crabbing, octopusing...  And also I got some fish and some trochus. <br/>Probst: How many fish? <br/>Today and yesterday, I went crazy with the spear and caught, like, 20, 22  fish in last two days. <br/>Probst: 22 fish in the last two days? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Parvati, now that Jonathan is here, in the last two days, he's got 22  fish. Is it starting to feel like, "Okay, Jonathan's growing on me."  He's blending in. Yeah, definitely. Jonathan is a big part of this tribe right now. He's been basically nourishing us so that we could have the energy to perform  today, you know, and it's cool to have him around. <br/>Probst: Adam, it's important that you keep people around who can keep your  tribe strong, and people that you trust, which could present a dilemma. You had two people come over who left their old tribe. There could be questions of trust there. But it's fair to say at this point that Candice and Jonathan both are now  very strong members of this tribe, and are helping keep you strong. <br/>Jeff, I'm tired of losing, and it's all about productivity for me. It's been other reasons before, and tonight it's about productivity. I don't like losing. I'm tired of it. <br/>Probst: Can't get much more clear than that. Okay, before we get to the vote, did somebody bring the bottle? So you've kept it sealed? <br/>Difficult, but we kept it sealed. <br/>Probst: We will hold on to that bottle until after we have voted. Once the vote is over, you will open the bottle and read the note inside. Okay, it is time to vote. Candice, you're up. <br/>You did you great today, but this is based on overall productivity. <br/>Jonathan, I think you're a great guy. You just came into the game too late. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Jonathan. Rebecca. One vote Jonathan, one vote Rebecca. Rebecca. Two votes Rebecca, one vote Jonathan. Rebecca. Three votes Rebecca, one vote Jonathan. Tenth person voted out, the second member of our jury, Rebecca. That's four, that's enough. Unless you have the hidden immunity idol, you need to bring me your torch. Rebecca, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Okay, now it's time to get to the bottle. Parvati, before you open it, was there a consensus as to what the note inside  might say? <br/>The consensus is it's a merge. Am I right, guys? But we don't know. We're hoping you're going to roll out a whole buffet for us with coffee. <br/>Ice cream. <br/>Champagne. <br/>Probst: Let's find out. Parvati? I want you to open the note and read it out loud. "You've just voted out one member of your tribe. You will now vote out another." That's not fun. <br/>Probst: Definitely not a merge. <br/>Not a merge, and not very cool. <br/>Probst: So Nate, not only are you not merging tonight, you're voting out  another tribe member right now. <br/>This is wack Arnold, man. And now I'm thinking, if we had this win today, they would have been down to  two. Could have, should have, would have-- spilled milk. <br/>Probst: There is no sign of a merge. It could be tomorrow. It could never come. Now you're down to five. They're at four. So, Adam, criteria now? <br/>You know, I think Rebecca stood out as one that wasn't productive. And there's no one else that does. So this is going to be much tougher. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to vote. Candice, you're up. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Jonathan. Jonathan. Two votes Jonathan. Jenny. Two votes Jonathan, one vote Jenny. Jenny. Two votes Jonathan, two votes Jenny. Jenny. That's three votes Jenny, two votes Jonathan. One vote left. The 11th person voted out of Cook Islands and the third member of our jury,  Jenny. Unless you have the hidden immunity idol, you need to bring me your torch. Jenny, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Well, tonight you lose two more members. You're now down to five. Maybe this is the wake-up call this tribe needs in order to get it together. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION Captioned by Media  Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: next time on Survivor:  He's back. <br/>Probst: At Raro...  Where's the water? Have we got water? <br/>Probst: Jonathan hits a breaking point. <br/>I'm not going to lose because you kids keep the get your asses out of bed. <br/>Probst: At Aitu... Yul shares his secret. <br/>If it works out, it will change the course of the game. And things heat up between Adam and Candice. <br/>To be honest, I am completely pissed off about tonight's vote. Jonathan did a great job of pulling his own weight. I respect that. But in the end, I feel completely burned because I was blindsided. And had I known or expected that there would be two voted out tonight, I  would have done everything possible to make sure I would still be in this  game.
