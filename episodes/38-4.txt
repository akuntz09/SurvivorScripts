<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor": At the Kama  tribe, Aurora, Joe, and Aubry were outcasts. <br/>Nobody wants to talk to us. <br/>Jeff: At the Manu tribe, Wendy was ruffling feathers. <br/>All creatures deserve to live. <br/>Do not tell me that we can't eat that chicken. <br/>Jeff: But would go had a plan of his own. <br/>I decided maybe it's not Wendy. It's Chris. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Chris was voted out. Chris, the tribe has spoken. And had a decision to make: Go home or grab the torch and go to  the Edge of Extinction. Captioning funded by cbs  I can't believe it! <br/>I am still processing it. <br/>You know I'm not--  You! <br/>I'm not sad. They got me. <br/>How's it feel? <br/>Terrible. I just feel betrayed. <br/>Oh! <br/>That's how it feels? Betrayal? <br/>Really? Man, I got blindsided. Man, I can't believe it. Seriously, you voted me out, and he totally blindsided Keith, so  that is a taste of your own medicine. Give me a break. You're not going to show up here and be treated with open arms. No thank you. No. This is what I went through. Read the sign, bro. <br/>"If at any point you wish to end your adventure,  raise the sail, and a boat will pick you up."  You're not going to come in here to the freaking holiday  inn. Sorry. It's the Edge of Extinction. <br/>I'm trying. I'm actually not as good as Chris. <br/>Wendy looks skinny. <br/>Your waist looks small. <br/>"Survivor" diet. <br/>Wendy's always under threat of going home, but it's never Wendy. Everybody has different styles of playing the game, and this is  mine. You don't know what I'm going to do next. But, at the same time, I understand that I was being crazy for  taking the flint, so I put the flint back and, like, David found it. And he said, "You guys, you found the flint." and  everybody is like, "Oh, look. It mysteriously popped up."  She literally took the flint. <br/>Like that's not normal. <br/>I'm not even close to being done. I already told Rick my master plan. <br/>What is it? What's your master plan? <br/>I don't want to tell you. You're going to get mad at me. <br/>God you are-- I've never either played with or seen  anybody play the way you do. <br/>Like a wild card. <br/>You want to win, don't you? <br/>Yeah, of course I do. <br/>Okay. I... Okay. <br/>Hey, look, I haven't been eliminated so far, so something  must be work. I feel like if I just go with the flow, things will work out. <br/>This should really be Wendy. <br/>Right. <br/>100%. Nobody playing games. <br/>Only because she's literally, like, living in her own  little eye don't even know what's going on up there. <br/>Why do you have such a ridiculously small shell? <br/>Right now there are five people working it, and Wendy is  the outsider. She's not a normal person. She hid our flint and thought it was funny. Who does that! She's always going to be this person you won't be able to trust. Wendy is the vote. That seems to make the most sense for everybody. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! Kama getting your first look at the new Manu tribe. Chris, voted out at the last tribal council. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>So wRong! <br/>Jeff: That may be the biggest reaction I've ever seen to a  vote-out. Ron, what is it that you're reading into seeing Chris being  voted out? <br/>You see how hard he works in challenges and you you see he  was carrying all-- the whole entire tribe. It &amp; to see they would vote him out, it's almost like a  betrayal. <br/>Jeff: Wow, Lauren, big words, "Betrayal," and  "Chris was carrying the entire tribe."  I think it's interesting to throw out words like that when  you have no idea what our camp life is like. <br/>Jeff: Once again, it speaks to the true, unpredictable  nature of this game. Because you're right, you don't know what's going on. Everybody, drop your buffs. <br/>Oh, Jeff probst! <br/>Jeff: You're switching from two tribes to three tribes. <br/>Expansion to three. <br/>When Jeff said, "Drop your buffs," I literally  turned to Joe and said, "I'm going to pee my pants right now." you  have this pit in your stomach. You have no control over that part of the game. It is completely random who you end up with. It's turns your game upside down. <br/>Jeff: He we are. The moment of truth. Everybody reveal. <br/>Here we go. Good luck y'all. <br/> Jeff: If you're blue goes go to blue. Yellow goes to yellow, and green in the middle. <br/>I'm green. <br/>I'm green. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>We're the whole tribe! <br/>Wow! The happy family staying together, I guess. <br/>Jeff: Everybody find your spot--  You're green. <br/>Oh, my God, I'm green! I thought I was blue. <br/>Jeff: This is crazy. At first glance, everybody is with their own former tribe  members with one exception, Wendy, the only lone wolf not with her own  original pack. <br/>No way! <br/>Holy crap. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: I am stunned. <br/>We're stunned. <br/>Would have been nice to meet you guys. <br/>Jeff: Gavin, you've been a fan of this game since you were  a kid. Ever recall a switch like this? <br/>I don't think so but I'm happy to be a part of this one. So I'm all smiles right now. <br/>Jeff: All right, we have three new tribes, and we end up  with, on Manu, four members from Kama, and one original member from Manu Wendy. <br/>Yes. <br/>How are you feeling right now? Because if "Survivor" is a game of numbers, and these  four are tight, you would be in trouble. <br/>Yeah, I would be in trouble. But all of these people look very athletic so I don't think  we're going to lose challenges. <br/>Jeff: Down at Kama, five original Kama, still wearing  yellow, still going back to the same camp. And in the middle, with a brand-new tribe, five former Manu,  your tribe name, Lesu. <br/>Lesu. <br/>L-e-s-u. <br/>That sounds about right. <br/>Jeff: Kama, grab your stuff and literally head back to  camp. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Have fun, guys. <br/>Jeff: Manu, grab your stuff. Wendy, show them around camp. <br/>Good luck with the chickens, Joe. <br/>Wendy is gonna hate him if he kills the chicken. <br/>Jeff: Lesu, a map to your new home. <br/>I could not believe we were still together. And Wendy is still on the tribe with her tightest alliance,  which is the chicken. And I'm think, good luck. Good luck with Wendy. <br/>What just happened! <br/>Insane! <br/>Kama! Kama! <br/>Coming into this tribe swap, I was super nervous because I  really didn't know where I stood with the original o.G. Kama tribe, but our numbers got cut in half so a new dynamic. <br/>Kama stRong, one, two, three. <br/>Kama stRong! <br/>I think the one difference I'm doing this season than past  season I'm trying to build more stRong, solid relationships. Sand everywhere, sandy. I feel really good with Aurora. Early on I feel like we'll connected and I do feel like she's on  my side. But there are only five of us, and I want to make sure we have a  little bit of a majority going. I'm really trying to solidify a relationship with Ron, who I  seem to have a pretty good rapport with. I feel great with you, bro. <br/>I feel agReement with you, too. <br/>And I think Aurora would vote with us. Every time I talk with her she's nothing but smiles and  lovey-dovey and awesome. Like we're in a really-- we're in a great spop spot. I'm just trying to think of, like, down the road, who is going  to try to take me out? <br/>The last thing I would want to do. Nobody's going to vote you out. That's ridiculous. <br/>I hope not. I had a great conversation with Joe at the watering hole because  I had to convince him I was with him. I acted like I love him, I adore him. And he was like, "All right, Ron, I got you." back at Kama. <br/>Kama, Kama. <br/>Best tribe. <br/>So he's walk around feeling really confident. What he doesn't know 20 minutes ago I told Julia, why don't you  go through Joe's bag. I'll keep him at the watering hole. <br/>I have to make sure Joe doesn't have an idol. Because if we lose a challenge, I may consider voting him out. He's too big of a threat, and he's a challenge beast, and we  need to get him out as quickly as possible because if we get to the merge,  they could be really dangerous. <br/>Hey, Julia. You find anything? <br/>No. There was nothing in there, nothing in his pants, nothing in his  bag of sea shells. I don't think he has it. <br/>Good job. We're probably not going to lose a challenge when you look at  how stRong our tribe sand if we do have to worry about it, we know that Joe  doesn't have an idol. He's going to be an easy target. <br/>You guys, the odds of that. <br/>That's a small percent. You take a constant, four out of 13, four out of 11. You multiply that four times. It's less than 1%. I was looking at those tribes, I think in challenges we stack up  really well with those two tribes. <br/>I think we do. <br/>That's all we have to do. <br/>That's all we need to do. <br/>The good thing about being all together on the new Lesu  tribe is we have relationships together. We trust each other. The problem is if we don't win, we're going to fracture real  quick. <br/>I wonder what Wendy is contingent them. <br/>Everything. <br/>Oh, everything. <br/>Wendy was the odd duck out and we could all really around  that and now we're all looking at each other. There's no odd person out. There's no distraction. We just know that if we lose, one of us is going home, and thus  far, we have not been good at winning. <br/>We should definitely get a fire going. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Coming to a new camp sucks. There is no shelter. There's very little rice. <br/>How crazy is this? <br/>This is insane. <br/>Being a returning player, I know "Survivor" is  hard. Even the stRongest person can break under these circumstances. <br/>You okay? <br/>Yeah, I just thought I was going to throw up for a second. But we're good. I think I thought coming out here would be super fun, and, like,  I really underestimated how difficult it is to not expeet to not sleep. It's a lot harder than I was ever expecting it to be. I'm so hungry. But, like, I can't eat the rice anymore because it just makes me  really nauseous. <br/>I know, it tastes so good. <br/>But more than, that I think the hardest part for me is not  being able to talk to my family. I really miss my mom and dad a lot. And it's really hard not to have that support system that tells  you, like, "It's okay." like "Everything's going to be  okay." so you're just kind wife these, you know, four other people that  you kind of trust, but they're not your family. They're just people that you're competing against. <br/>Why don't we go down to the beach and I can give you the  grand tour. <br/>That's perfect. <br/>We have the entire beach. And the beaches kind of meet right there. And there's our makeshift fire pit. <br/>That's a clever idea. <br/>If you guys want tree mail, it's down that path. There are a bunch of sharks so this is the best place to fish. So then--  This is the well. <br/>Nice. <br/>Thanks for showing us around. <br/>It's your camp, too. <br/>Yeah, thank you. <br/>I am really excited about the tribe flop. We have four Kama with the loan Manu. If we liewrkz we've got Wendy. She's the easy pickoff. <br/>You've got spunk, girl. <br/>You did. <br/>You've got spunk. Right on. <br/>The I think is that's tough sireally like Wendy. She is very sweet and she's a kind heart. <br/>Our camp was nice but we didn't have the views you have  here. <br/>We have the views, but, like, my tribe sucked. <br/>Really? <br/>Really. <br/>I'm happy I got stuck with you guys. I don't care if I'm on the bottom. They were bullies. <br/>Really? Serious? <br/>Who is the ring leader. <br/>That girl is giving me everything about the Manu tribe. She's giving us a full rundown of every single player. <br/>You don't think dave and Kelley want to play together? <br/>From what I've seen, I don't think so. <br/>This girl is a wealth of information. And these an save the. <br/>Where are the chickens at? Did you kill them yet? <br/>We have two left. <br/>We have fishing gear. <br/>Do they lay any eggs? <br/>They're going to start laying some. <br/>You think they will start laying? <br/>I think so. <br/>Chickens seem to be doing good. <br/>They're cute, aren't they? <br/>Hey, chickens, no pressure but you better start laying  eggs, or I'm going to eat you. <br/>I think you just cut the head off, and then you boil it, I  think. And then the feathers come out easy. Rotisserie chicken. <br/>I genuinely like my new tribe. I feel really bad doing this. I know on their agenda was to kill these chickens and,  obviously, I have my own agenda. And I finally released the chickens! They're free! Their lives are saved. This is my faster plan. I'm ecstatic. I just have to head back now, go to sleep and pretend,  "What? What? What chickens? I'm so happy! [ thunder ]  It's raining, bro. <br/>Okay, now it's coming. <br/>Okay, now it's coming. <br/>All you could do was just sit there in your wetness and  just be angry, be mad. Be hungry, be whatsoever. It just sucks. The mind is the stRongest thing you have out here, but it's also  the most dangerous thing. It has made me look at that mast, raising that mast is a  complete losing solution. Like, that mast is my food. That mast is my burger. It's a nice bed. It's a hot shower. It's a freaking dry towel. That mast is everything. So right now my mind is my freaking best friend, but also my  worst enemy. <br/>You all right? <br/>Huh? <br/>You all right? <br/>Yeah. I needed a second. <br/>I'm sure he thinks we're plotting against him. Who cares. <br/>Just because you cry and you were blindsided in the game  does not mean I should automatically feel sad for you because you did not  feel sad for me when you voted for me. I don't need him. <br/>He's going through the remorse process. <br/>He is. <br/>I don't want to be here. But I am. It's, like, voluntary torture. I'm stuck on an island with two people that are pissed at me. I've got nothing but myself. It's really hard being out here. A lot of my fears started to come out. I've got a fear of failure. Of, need for approval. Like, just trying to be perfect. This perfectionist. And, you know, all those fears happened. I failed. Like, it got me voted out, this ideal of playing a perfect game  is completely shot. So coming to terms with that. Maybe that's a part of this journey, too. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Good job! <br/>That's a win for the day. <br/>Yeah, congratulations. <br/>I like Chris today better than Chris yesterday, right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>The real test to adaptation is out here. I'm out here to get as far as I possibly can despite all the  obstacles that are being thrown at me right now. <br/>Thank you for lunch. <br/>This is amazing. <br/>We're so hungry. <br/>Tasty. <br/>Thank you for being a fisherman. <br/>I don't know what this island has in store yet. Are we on a tribe? Are we going against each other? Time will tell. So I'm just going to look out for them as best I can and hope  they look out for me. We're kind of a strange family out here. <br/>It's a lizard. <br/>Dude, get that away from me. <br/>Watch out, it's coming to get you. <br/>I swear to God, dude. I will drop-kick you. That is lame, freaking lame. <br/>I can't believe it. In the morning, chickens are gone. To me it seems like there's only one person here to doesn't want  to see the chicken, Wendy. It's possible Wendy let the chickens go. She's like, "They're going to kill them. I'm going to let them go. <br/>Chickens, I just think it's a soft spot in Wendy's heart. But if I catch one, it's not going back in the coop. It's going under the machete. It's crazy. She... Serious? That's not cool. That's not cool, chickens! So what do you guys want to do today? <br/> What if we just-- let's try to catch it. <br/>No! <br/>Well, Wendy, you're making ma this tough. <br/>Please, guys. That would be worse than me going to tribal council. <br/>Girl, you set free breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Like, I'm still 100% all for killing the chickens. I do not care if Wendy cries herself to sleep at night. <br/>Please, guys, you're my best tribe. You're my tribemates. <br/>She kind of went nuts. You'd rather get voted out than see a chicken die? That's bizarre. That's not someone you can trust. That's someone you vote out. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Jeff: All right, shall we get to today's immunity  challenge? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: First things first, Julia, I got to take it back. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. And today, two tribes will win immunity. [ applause ] two tribes will be safe at the vote. Let's get to it. For today's challenge, you're going to race over a series of  a-frames while carrying coils of rope. You'll then use that rope to pull a heavy crate to the finish. Use the pieces inside the crate to solve a puzzle. First two tribes to solve the puzzle, win immunity, safe from  tribal council, losers, somebody will be the fourth person voted out of this  game. All right, give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right, day 11, on "Survivor," rain coming down in Fiji. Here we go. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! You gotta get up and over that a-frame. <br/>It's siply, it's slippery. <br/>Jeff: Everybody slides down for Lesu. Quickly, erik and Gavin are up for Manu. They pull up Victoria. They're pulling up Wendy. Joe gets up now for Kama. There goes Lauren trying to get up. <br/>I can't! <br/>Jeff: It is Manu in the early lead. <br/>Grab the rope, pull. <br/>Yes, yes, you got it. I got you. <br/>Jeff: David trying to get up. Kama's good. Lesu falling behind now. Manu now working on that second wall. <br/>Get the rope! Get the rope! Get the rope! It is lawreb first up for Lesu. She uses the rope to pull up Wentworth. That rain has made the wall very slippery. <br/>Want to help each snrg. <br/>Jeff: Joe now going to use himself as a human ladder. <br/>Go, go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: Finally Lesu has everybody up. Kama making a human ladder. This is what you do on "Survivor"! Working together as a tribe to solve a problem. <br/>I can't reach. <br/>Ron on Julia's shoulders. And here comes Aubry. The entire tribe is a human ladder. <br/>Good job, Aubry! <br/>Jeff: Everybody struggling to get to the top. David gets to the top for Lesu. There goes Gavin, now. Julie now gets to the top. There goes Wentworth. You're good, Manu! <br/>Get the rope! <br/>Would go sup, and Joe is up. Everybody comes down at once. Second phase of this challenge now. You've got to attach your three coils of rope. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: You're going to use this now to pull that crate. Once your rope's together, you can start pulling. <br/>One, two, three! <br/>Jeff: Manu has their rope together. Manu starting to pull. There goes Kama now. Lesu now has their ropes together. They're in on it. All three tribes fighting for immunity on day 11 in  "Survivor: Edge of Extinction"! <br/>One, two, three! Kama's first there. Manu's there. You're good! <br/>One, two, three! <br/>Jeff: Big pull by Lesu. You're good, Lesu! Now you have to start untying knots to get that top off. Then untie knots to get the puzzle pieces free. Great communication from cambodia. Everybody calm and talking. Manu right on their tail. Lesu is right behind. <br/>Put them all in. <br/>Jeff: It will be Joe and Ron on the puzzle for Kama. Erik and Aubry on the puzzle for Manu. Here comes Lesu with their puzzle pieces. And it's going to be Wentworth and David on the puzzle for Lesu. Now you can start solving. <br/>Grab that-- Ron, grab that piece. <br/>Jeff: It's a slow, methodical process as you begin to  figure out when pieces need to move where. <br/>There are two dragons. <br/>That's right. <br/>One at a time. <br/>Jeff: This is where communication will be essential. <br/>Right to left. <br/>Jeff: Up to the make sure you're making complementary  moves. <br/>Yes, Joe. <br/>Jeff: You will know you're making progress as you start to  see these symbols start together. <br/>See the open space, the one on the left? That has to match iewp. <br/>No, switch those. <br/>Jeff: Aubry going to swap out. Here comes Wendy now for Manu. It's erik and Wendy. <br/>Good job, guys! Good job, guys! <br/>Jeff: Ron and Joe have a lot of momentum now. <br/>The one on the end of the dragon is not correct. <br/>Jeff: Wendy is coming in moving a lot of piece. David and Wentworth still studying, trying to figure out which  moves to make. <br/>That's right. The one in your left hand is wRong. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Jeff: Maem thinks they have it. And they do! Kama wins immunity. We're looking for one more. <br/>Another one at a time. One at a time. <br/>Come oManu! <br/>Come on, Manu! <br/>Jeff: It is Manu and Lesu now. Let's go, ma tue. You got this. <br/>Jeff: Erik and Wendy quickly moving pieces down. They think they were just off a little bit. <br/>Yes, yes. <br/>Are you sure on this? <br/>Jeff: Wentworth quickly moving. David moving pieces. Who will get there first. Is that right? Is that right, guys? Jeff! Jeff! <br/>Jeff: Manu thinks they have it. Manu wins immunity. Safe from tribal, sending Lesu to tribal council, where the  fourth person will be voted out of this game. <br/>Good try. Good work. <br/>Jeff: Kama, congratulations. [ applause ] immunity is yours. Kama remains undefeated in immunity challenges. Manu, your first immunity win. New tribe makeup, same tribe name. Maybe that's the difference. Kama, Manu, grab wur stuff. Head back to camp. No tribal council. Nobody going home. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Lesu, first challenge as a new tribe. First loss. See you tonight at tribal where somebody will be the fourth  person voted out of "Survivor: Edge of Extinction." grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>This tribe is so bad. We're like the cleveland brown tribe. Like, we can't get anything right. I feel like I'm, honestly, in a nightmare. This is a group of five people that has been voting together,  and now we're, like, cutting out one of the family. It's horrible. <br/>We're not very good at challenges. <br/>Lesu proves to be as good at losing as Manu. And now we have to cannibalize ourselves. Someone is going home. <br/>On the one hand it was really great swapping with all you  guys. But on the other hand, now, here we are. <br/>This is when it would be nice to have one common person to  vote out. <br/>Mmmm, it would be. <br/>It really sucks. You build these relationships and you think they're going to be  the relationships that propel you forward in the game, and then we end up in  a position where the people we trust the most, we've got to turn on. <br/>Listen, I'm not going to write your name down no matter  what, like...  I'm not going to write your name down no matter what. That's a promise. <br/>Okay. <br/>Lauren has been not eating. She hasn't eaten in three days. She threw up what she had eaten today, this morning. I don't know if you know that. <br/>We love Lauren. But she's not eating. We're not going to be stRong. <br/>Wentworth is the person I want out of this game for sure,  but the timing just isn't right. <br/>Yeah, 100%. Within the first three days. I have no evidence to back this up, but I'm 100% convinced that Wentworth  has a hidden immunity idol. I know Wentworth's game. She always starts looking for the idol on day one. And so I think best-case scenario tonight is that the vote goes  towards Lauren. All in on Lauren. <br/>All in on Lauren. <br/>Yeah. <br/>What do you think? <br/>I don't know. <br/>I know, I know. But I want to vote with you. <br/>Yeah, I want to vote with you, too. <br/>Going into this tribal, I feel like my life in this game  is the line. I'm worried they will think I'm the weakest. Even though I don't think I am. I think not eating gives this perception of, "Oh, that's a  reason to vote her out." I was a collegiate athlete. I played division one soccer for four years and I'm a stRong  player and I don't think people know it. I think it's more likely that wick switches. <br/>I think so, too. <br/>I think Rick has the ability to go to the other  tribe--  And schmooze his way in. <br/>I think I have a little bit of stability because I have  the idol but that's stressful, too, because I want to bring the idol to the  merge. <br/>I think he will be with us. <br/>I think he will be with us, too. <br/>So what do we think? I'm writing down what you and Lauren want to write down? <br/>You and Lauren are really tight. She needs to start eating, right? <br/>I know, I know. Wardog is in control of this vote. I think he does want to work with me. My fear is he could use David and Gavin to vote out Lauren  And he might be more susceptible to throw us under the bus  at the merge. <br/>Wardog is really hard to read. I think he's trying to play "Survivor" like poker, so  I don't know if he's telling the truth. I know he's not just having a conversation with me. There's no way. <br/>Where's your head at? <br/>I'm torn. <br/>The only thing I would think is, like, Lauren is not even  eating. She hasn't eaten for days. <br/>I like Rick a lot, and so it's sad. And I feel like he can easily talk himself into anything at the  merge. And out of-- like, I don't think he would stay true to us. <br/>No one's brand is more loyalty than me. That's my brand. So Lauren's weak, I'm loyal. That's just my pitch, man. <br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah. After being able to talk to each person individually, it's  obvious that I'm in a classic swing vote spot, and I love it. I'm built for this game. Whether it was being in the army, whether it was playing poker,  whether now law school, I'm always thinking, always going through options,  never closing doors. And that's what I'm doing now. I'm going to take 15-20 minutes of Wardog time to think. The tribe say tight-knit group but it's no longer about the  tribe now. It's about Wardog. And I need a dance partner. Who can get Wardog closer to winning $1 million. <br/>I will mark day 11, our last day together as a happy  family. <br/>God, this is awful. <br/>Sometimes you just have to go with your instinct, go with  your different skill sets, your tools, blend them all together in the blender  and see what color comes out and that's what I'm doing right now. <br/>Jeff: All right, devon give me a news report about what's  going on with this tribe? da-da-da Lesu is even less than we even expected. Love in tribal council, but will it last? Good evening, I'm Rick Devens. This may be my last report."  Jeff: What's good right now about this tribe? <br/>We love each other. We love each other. There's a lot of mutual respect. And that's it. Everything else is just crap right now. <br/>Jeff: Wardog, literally, that's it-- affection for each  other is the only good thing happening right now? <br/>And respect. <br/>Jeff: Oh, two things. <br/>Two things. And everything else is a mess. You see in challenges, we're a mess. Our new camp is a mess. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, what's up with the new camp? <br/>There's limited amount of food. There's limited amount of supplies. And building an entire new shelter with only five people is  exhausting. I mean, it was exhausting with nine people. So it's really bad. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth, there's a lot to be said for having  played before, some advantages come with that. Does that help at all when it's raining and you're sleeping in  the sand? Or is it the same for everybody? <br/>It's the same for everybody. I mean, I went through the ringer in cambodia. And then when I'm here with this tribe and we're going through  it together, I'm instantly put back there. I'm going to get emotional just thinking about it because it's,  like-- I feel like everything is just piling up today. <br/>Jeff: How so? <br/>We're just so close. It sounds ridiculous because we're all strangers. But... We've been through a lot together already, and I just--  tonight is just really hard. So... [ sighs ] I'm just a little sad tonight. <br/>Jeff: Devens are you surprised how fast you can form a  family with people you might never even meet in life otherwise? <br/>It is crazy. We've been out here 11 days, and I love these people. Like, even if I was voted out tonight, I would love these  people. That's not too inspire you to do that. But we feel like the whole world's against us. We're losing to these two tribes who are yelling and cheering  each other on, and the only thing we have is each other. <br/>Jeff: Wardog, what is it about this adventure that even on  your worst nights, you're still smiling? <br/>For me, I feel like this is the game of games. And now that I'm actually in ti realize how complex the game  is-- all the relationships, the challenges, the duplicity of everything  that's going on. And then there's the actual survival part which tests all your  skills-- your physical, your mental, your emotional. I love it. I'm in an adventure and it's the ultimate competition. <br/>Jeff: Devens, it's really interesting, everybody was  smiling at some point while Wardog was talking. What were you thinking about as he was explaining why he's here? In my regular life, I can be complacent, you know. News is so competitive, and everyone wants to move up to the  biggest markets. But there's also, like, fear of rejection, not wanting to take  that risk. And then you come out here and it's like you send the biggest  risk you could do. And you're, like, "I don't want to go home right now. I'm here to play." and you prove something to yourself. And you hope you can take that home with you. <br/>Jeff: David, you were really open the first time you  played about fearing rejection from the world, if you were even worthy to be  on a tribe. <br/>Absolutely. And what they realize or don't realize yet is there are things  to be found in this experience that are worth more than the million dollars  that's at the end of it. My life is way better for this experience, judging vuft played  it once, than it would have been had I not played it at all. I thought I just wanted to play "Survivor." I wasn't  until I got inside it that I needed to play it. <br/>Jeff: And that is why everyone of you wants to play. The stakes are so hard, and that's why it's so hard and winning  is so glorious. And yet, Lauren, the game demands that somebody get their torch  snuffed moments from now. <br/>Tonight is extremely hard. We respect each other a lot. This tribal is not going to be ugly. It's not going to be hateful. It's not going to be something that tears another person down. But there are going to be lines drawn because in a five-person  tribe, a 3-2 majority can turn to a 2-3 minority really fast. <br/>Jeff, the whole feeling for me is different than the first  three tribals. The first three tribals had a reason behind. There was games manship. The tribal tonight, if it's not me, it's one of my four family  members here. If my torch is snuffed, I have no hard feelings, and if it's one  of these four, I hope they have no hard feelings against me. A game is a game. <br/>I have to say this is one of the most emotional incredible  tribal-- it is the most emotional incredible tribal I've been to. <br/>Tonight? <br/>Yes. And I've been to a lot of them. <br/>It does feel special in a very sad way. <br/>Jeff: All right, it is time to vote. David you're up. David you're up. <br/>You're such a terrific person, but not the not eating  worries me about you and about our chances and challenges. <br/>I'm so sorry. I hate this vote so much. I hate this vote so much. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Jeff: If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want  to play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. First vote, Lauren. Rick. One vote Lauren, one vote Rick. Lauren. That's two votes Lauren, one vote Rick. Rick. We're tied-- two votes Lauren, two votes Rick, one vote left. Fourth person voted out of "Survivor: Edge of Extinction,"  Rick devins. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Dude, I'm sorry. <br/>It's all good. <br/>See you later, brother. <br/>Jeff: Devens, the tribe has spoken. <br/>I take it all back. You guys are the worst. I love you guys. Go win something. <br/>We love you. <br/>I'm rooting for you. captioning funded by cbs captioned by media access group at wgbh  access.Wgbh.Org  Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor." a diabolical  plan. <br/>Wardog say crazy man. <br/>Jeff: And a ray of light. <br/>Me, you, Wendy, get rid of erik. <br/>I was psyched to hear her say that. <br/>Jeff: Can push you over the edge. <br/>Hurry up. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>We're on the Edge of Extinction, but we're not out of the  game. I had already been picturing myself eating a burger as I left tribal  but holy crap, I'm stim stillin this. I guess I'm going to do my best to ingratiate myself to these  people who hate me. There could be a lot of anger. <br/>Man, you are not in good grace here, sweetheart. <br/>This is going to be wild.
