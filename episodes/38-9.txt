<br/> Wow. That was some tribal. That was incredible. <br/>Crazy. <br/>Going into tribal, I felt like it's going to be me. And then Aurora starts talking about the dysfunction of the Kama  tribe, and tribal just goes crazy. But you never know if stuff is just theater at tribal council,  so Rick and I play the idol on me. I didn't need it. So that's a wasted idol, but who cares? It was the right move given the just complete chaos that we were  surrounded by. <br/>She did. <br/>I don't think she realizes it's her fault Julia is gone. Aurora just kept spewing on and on, and essentially put  everybody's cards on the table, and it literally was like a perfect storm of,  like, something's about to give. In this case it was Julia's torch gone. <br/>It's done. <br/>I want to build a six-person alliance, and what I bring to  the table is me, Kelley, and Lauren. We voted always together, every single vote. You and Julie always voted together. And the other person I really trust is Gavin. That's what I want. In the old Lesu, I was the pilot on all the votes, but since the  merge, I was just a passenger on the plane. And was like I thought. The Wardog is being told what to do. But now Kama has fractured and I'm going to take advantage. I propose that the six of us go loyal to the six. After that, hey, gloves are off. We're all playing for a million dollars, right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Wouldn't it be nice if we could just relax and be stRong. <br/>Right. <br/> I told them my idea, and they all loved it. And now they want Aurora out next. It's just amazing how these people just imploded. <br/>Somehow, it all went to hell. I literally put my foot in my mouth, and I ruined possibly my  game. And now, everyone's going off on walks but me. So I'm good being alone. And so, I'm just trying to see what tomorrow brings. I'm going to play. I'm not giving up. The problem is I don't know if I have a tomorrow. Ing. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>This looks medieval. <br/>Jeff: All right, shall we get to today's immunity  challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: First things first, Gavin. Gotta take it back. Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you'll have a bar resting on your  shoulders. It will force you into a very uncomfortable position. If you go too low, your flag will pop. If gutoo high, your urn will drop. Either way, you're out. Last person left squatting wins immunity, safe from the vote. Losers, tribal council, where somebody will be the tenth person  voted out of this game. But if today you feel a certain level of safety, this is a good  challenge to just sit out. And instead--  No! <br/>Jeff: ...Feast on a mountain of pizza! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: Plus cold beer and root beer. Big decision to make. You're going to make it, and we'll get started. Let's do it. <br/>Oh, God! <br/>Jeff: All right, Lauren, Victoria, Wentworth, and Ron have  chosen to sit out and eat. Everybody take your spots. Slowly lift that bar. Make sure that stripe is right there on your shoulders. Here we go in five, four, three, two, one... Everybody looks  good. This challenge is on. Big in! The mountain of pizza is going to be devoured, as Lauren, Victoria,  Wentworth, and Ron decided to give up their shopt at immunity and eat pizza. David already looking over. <br/>I wanted that. <br/>Jeff: It's not what you chose. <br/>It's great. <br/>Jeff: It's a game of decisions. <br/>It's so good. <br/>Jeff: You're already feeling it. This is an uncomfortable spot, and the tRick is, if you try to  get a little relief by going a little lower, that flag will pop. If you go a little higher, thaturn will drop, dousing your  flame. Either way, you're out. You cannot waiver with your concentration. <br/>Jeff: Wardog's out, first person down. We are down to five. Gavin cannot hang in there anymore. Gavin drops. <br/>I'm debate. <br/>Jeff: Julie just gives out. Her legs dropped out from under her. Julie is out. We're down to three. David, Aurora, and devin. 10 minutes into this challenge. So nice to go to tribal with immunity. David trying to stretch it out and, man, those bars are moving. Devens struggling. You can see it, but he's still in it. No movement from Aurora. 19 minutes into this challenge. <br/>You all are amazing. <br/>How about you, Devens? <br/>Da-da-da! This sucks. <br/>Jeff: Aurora and David still in it, but not looking as  good as Devens. <br/>I can't believe he's talking. <br/>Jeff: Devens drops out, and we are down to two, another  showdown, David versus Aurora. <br/>How you feeling? <br/>I'm not dropping, dude. You knew last tribal council. I won't survive if I don't have it. I'm not going down. Sorry, bro. <br/>Jeff: You're at 22 minutes. <br/>Careful, David. That's getting high, bro. <br/>Jeff: Aurora hoping David makes a mistake and drops. <br/>Jeff: Aurora hoping David makes a mistake and drops. David drops. Aurora wins her second individual immunity challenge. Safe tonight at tribal council. <br/>And breaks it, sorry. <br/>Jeff: Can barely stand. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Jeff: Aurora, come on over. [ applause ] for the second time, immunity is yours, safe  tonight at tribal council, cannot be voted out of this game. And the way things have been going, that has to be a great  feeling. <br/>Very good. <br/>Jeff: As for the rest of you, after 25 days, tribal  council tonight. Somebody will be the tenth person voted out of this game. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. Congrats. It won't be you. <br/>I am not thrilled that Aurora won immunity. I really, really wanted her to go home tonight, and now the game  has changed so much, I don't know what I'm going to do at this point. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Great job. <br/>That was not easy. <br/>Aurora wins immunity, which is frustrating, because people  don't want her in the game anymore, but there are other options on the table. <br/>The shix should have a powwow. <br/>Let's do that. <br/>I think the six are staying wRong. Essentially there are four people on the outside. With Aurora winning, you have David, Devens, or Victoria. It's like when whichone do you take out now? <br/>This is a group of six so I think we need to come to a  group decision. <br/>What if we snuck attack and take out David now. <br/>All of us are voting David. <br/>I wanted David out at the last tribal council, because  he's a returning player and a huge strategic threat. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>If we don't get him out now, he's going going to waltz his  way to the end of the game. <br/>There are people out there who will get us to try to start  turning against each other and we don't need that. <br/>My plan to take out my nemesis in this game, David wright,  happens tonight. I never worked with Ron or Julia ever on any vote. And in a senior where we've had five major blindsides, you can  never say, "Oh, yeah, I've safe tonight. <br/>Well, then there were two. <br/>That Lesu three was going to be gone right away, and they  keep going. <br/>I think we go for Wardog. <br/>It's insane that we even have to have these conversations  because they're a power trio. Just do the math. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Victoria seems genuinely not on the other side, doesn't  she? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I feel like vic is with us. <br/>We need to, like, figure out where Ron and Julie are at. And get Aurora. Praise jesus. <br/>It looks like Devens or myself could be going home  tonight, but I've played "Survivor" before, and I know I can turn  things around for myself. Maybe I'm just myopic, but I want to vote out Wardog. I know that he doesn't want me in this game, and I have to get  him before he gets me. <br/>How do you feel? <br/>I'm trying to think about what's best-case scenario for  me. <br/>There's 10 of us, right? <br/>10. <br/>If you, Aurora, Julie, Ron, David and I come together. <br/>That's what I was hoping. <br/>We run the game. <br/>That was my ideal scenario. So I'm glad that you just counted it off. <br/>I think that would be amazing. <br/>Yeah. At this point, I feel like I'm on the bottom, so definitely if I  can get out of that role, I'm going to. And this sounds like the plan that could work. <br/>Have you already made up your mind, like, what you're  doing tonight? You don't even have to tell me what it is. <br/>I haven't. Obviously, there are two main sides still. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Who-- okay, who would you want out? <br/>I think it's only smart to get rid of someone in the power  trio. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I would prefer Wardog first. And then I don't care what the order is. <br/>My long game does not include three Lesu members. It's absolutely true that the Lesu three are controlling the game. And they are not talking to me. So even though I never thought I would work with Devens and David,  I don't see any other option right now. <br/>It's been very rough for you these last few days, I know,  so I don't to but putt any, like, unnecessary pressure on you. But, like, people are trying to preserve the power trio. They're skating through this game to the very end, and everyone  is letting them do it. I don't understand it. <br/>So who's your person to vote out? <br/>Wardog. <br/>I don't think we have the numbers. <br/>We have the numbers. <br/>But--  If you and Ron come on board with us. Not to pull this card--  No, please, do. <br/>But I've played "Survivor" before, and there's  always that one conversation after the game soever you think about and I  wonder, "Why didn't I do this other thing?" and that's this  conversation. <br/>I'm very nervous. Ron and I formed a six-person alliance with the Lesu three,  which I don't know if I'm 100% committed to right now. Wardog's dictating who is going home tonight. That does not sit well with me. And now I'm wondering if Ron and I are doing the right thing. Rick and David, they were talking about a final six of you and  me and Victoria and Aurora. So I feel like we're in a position now kind of in the middle where  we could decide which final six do we want to go with. <br/>Right now, I'm feeling pretty good with Wardog, Lauren,  and Kelley. <br/>Right. My only fear is, again, the two of us will end up on the bottom. <br/>Two days another I was in trouble. But now I'm in the middle of two alliances, and both are trying  to gain my favor. On the one hand, I think Wardog and his alliance of six could  work. But problem is I think Wardog would kin if he gets to the final  three. He's playing a really good game. But at the same time, I don't trust David. He's sneaky. And so I don't know if I want to get in bed with David or Wardog. <br/>Us in the final five with three of them is too dangerous. Like, I obviously want to work with you. Like, I'm hoping you want to work with me. <br/>Of course. Jewel semi ride or die, and we have the power tonight. I wish I could have a little bit more time to let it marinate,  but we're going to have to make a decision quickly. <br/>We're pretty sure it's going to be David or I tonight, and  then you guys are going to be in the minority. You're going to go home, too. And we're all going to be on the jury, and it's just a matter of  days. <br/>Let me think about it. <br/>Devens and David's pitch makes sense to me. But Ron's unsure. Together, we can flip the game on its head, but we have to be on  the same page. This could be our million-dollar decision, and no matter what  happens, I'm ready to expect, like, fireworks tonight. Happens, I'm ready to expect, like, fireworks tonight. <br/>Jeff: I'll now bring in the members of our jury. So, David, after the last tribal, which started calm and it  erupted, you can feel an emotional drain on everybody? <br/>Yeah, yeah. I mean, everyone walked in with one of two plans, and a third  plan emerged. It was insane. It's almost like it's the beginning of the game, because we're  all trying to figure out who are the people I can trust and work with right  now going forward? <br/>Jeff: So, Devens, when you're juggling all of these  temporary relationships, is there always one or two that are locked in? <br/>Yeah. Loyalty and trust is so important in this game. And I didn't come into the game playing a loyal game. I backstabbed Chris, and I got voted out the next trooibl. And when I got back, I decided I'm playing a loyal game. Tonight, David and I feel like we're in trouble. We asked for help, and we hope someone shows up. <br/>Jeff: Julie, last tribal you were vocal and loud about  saying you did not believe in the people you had believed in. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Where are you sitting tonight? How did the game shift for you? <br/>Ron and I came into that tribal feeling like we were on  the bottom of the alliance. I realized, I'm a passenger on someone else's plane, and I'm  hitting the "Eject" button right now, and I'm so glad that I did. Because now I feel like maybe I'm on my own little plane right  now, but it's still me flying the plane. <br/>Jeff: So, Devens, is this the kind of person you go to,  someone who has their own single-seater? <br/>Absolutely. Someone like Julie who made a bold move last time, you go to say  &amp; say, "Let's make another bold move together."  Jeff: Wardog, you don't agree? <br/>What better example than me, Lauren, and Wentworth. We have voted together eight times. We demonstrated loyalty more than anybody else. <br/>Does that sound like a group that's going to be easy to  infiltrate? <br/>No, but are you assuming something. You don't know the dynamic in the group. Just because the three of vus voted together, because we've had  to, didn doesn't mean that t going to last forever. <br/>I don't agree at all. I feel like Wardog, Kelley, and Lauren, have been together since  day one, have never deviated on a vote. Why would they want to sit next to a Kama, when they can sit  together in a final three, having only turned on the exact same people and argue  their case? But nobody for the last several votes is willing to take that  on. And they're going to lose this game because of it. <br/>Jeff: Ron, where are you in this? <br/>I feel like it's been a very hard sell to Julie and me. I don't understand well to that. I don't respond well to that. I don't think Julie does either. We have to make decisions over who we feel has treated us the  best. <br/>Wardog did nato you. <br/>Wardog is very aggressive. He's very aggressive and vocal. <br/>Hey, my brand, honestly, is loyalty. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Okay! <br/>Stop, stop, stop, stop right now! <br/> The same time he said, "Lauren, I will not vote for  you."  "Lauren, I will never write your game down." we  can't play that card. <br/>You're such a squirmer. You squirm from place to place, from person, to person, to  person. You're a great talker at tribal council, and that's why, in my  opinion, you have to go. <br/>Jeff: David, as the numbers dwindle, the burden shifts on  the other people to own their game. <br/>That's exactly right. Tonight is a choice between an easy vote or a hard vote. The hard vote saves us all, and puts us in the better position  to make it to day 39 and make a case for the million dollars. That's what I want to do. The easy vote sends one of us home, but more importantly, ends  the games of the other people I'm working with. That plan is taking on water. So all I ask is how deep must our ship sink before the rest of  us realize we're drowning? <br/>Jeff: Wow, Wentworth, that's a pretty compelling speech. <br/>I just know what he's doing. I've been in his position before. I've been on the bottom. But there was a group born from the last tribal, and I feel  confident that the group that is together will stay together. <br/>Jeff: All right, it is time to vote. Lauren, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally votes. <br/>Jeff: If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want  to play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. First vote, David. Wardog David. <br/>Very formal. Wardog. We're tied, two votes David, two votes Wardog. David. That's three votes David. David. That's four votes David. David. That's five votes David. Two votes Wardog. Tenth person voted out and the seventh member of our jury, David. That's six, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Here we go again, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: David, the tribe has spoken. <br/>No hard feelings, guys. You know I had to try. But I am going to claw my way back in. <br/>Later, buddy. <br/>Decision to make... I'm taking the torch. <br/>Decision to make... I'm taking the torch. <br/>The game is back on. <br/>It's my first morning on the exej of combination, and Joe  walks in with sieve bottles with seven clues. I'm like gam on. <br/>It's a clue to an advantage, and the rest of these people,  they've been here for days and days, and so they're just hungry and tired and  angry and resentful. Whereas I just got voted out of the game. I'm still in game mode. See ya! And I take off. <br/>Immediately, I have an idea in my mind where I think it's  going to be. It says something about "When you're at your most  hollow," and I think maybe it means hungry. So then I think maybe it's near the rice bucket. It's not there. <br/>David and myself, we run down this side of the beach,  can't find anything. And then I'm thinking through it with Joe... "Hollow,  jagged and smooth." and we're like what if it's at the mast, because the  sail itself is jagged on the edges, and it's where you go when you're at your  most hollow. We dig around there, but we can't find anything. <br/>I read the clue, and immediately, I think it's got to be  in these rocks around here somewhere. Unyou know, "Hollow, smooth, jagged." it's got to be  in the rocks. Finally, I see it, sitting there right before me is the  advantage hidden under a rock. And I'm like, "Oh, my God! This is the first lucky thing that's happened to me this  game." "Your advantage allows to you help someone else. You must send an advantage in the next immunity challenge to  someone in the game." wow. I have a decision to make. I have a chance to make somebody feel good about me because  fimake it back into this game, that can be the difference between winning and  losing. For so long, I've been trying to turn my game around, and to  find something that can finally flip my game around, it means the world. I'm endangered, but I'm not extinct. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Jeff: All right, let's get to today's immunity challenge. First things first, Aurora, for the second time, I must take it  back. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to balance a padole a stand. On my "Go," you'll roll a ball down the paddle,  attempting to land it in a dimple. The first person to get one ball in each of the five dimples,  wins immunity, safe from the vote. Loser, tribal council, where somebody will be the 11th person  voted out of this game. <br/>Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Devens. <br/>I got a present this morning from my good buddy David. <br/>Oh, boy! <br/>It says I'm going to have some sort of advantage. <br/>Wow! <br/>Jeff: Devens your advantage is instead of five because you  only have to land four balls. Big advantage. Everybody take your spots. We'll get started. All right, everybody pick up yr paddles. Devens, toss me one of your balls. Here we go. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go. Like ever "Survivor" challenge, there is a touch to  figuring this out. Your job is to try to finesse that ball down the paddle and land  it in a dimple. Those are very shallow dimples. It takes a nice touch. There are five balls and five dimples. DevDevens has the advantage of o needing to land four balls. Devens is close to landing that first ball. You'll know it. Devens has his first ball, working on his second. Ron doing a nice job. Ron lands his first ball. Ron and Devens now. Aurora looking to stick one. Aurora has her first ball. Wentworth drops. Lauren drops. Julie drops. She's got to start again. Devens with his second ball out there now. Devens lands his second ball. It is Devens in the lead, and Devens only has to land four to  win. Aurora very close. Aurora with two now. Ron working on his second ball. Ron has his second ball. We've got a challenge going here. <br/>This is so hard! <br/>Jeff: Lauren trying to stick her virs. Victoria still unsuccessful. Julie still unsuccessful. Gavin drops. Wentworth, no love at all down on the end. Can't get anything going. Devens has his third ball. Devens now working on his fourth and final ball. Huge immunity on day 27. Devens knocks off his third ball with his fourth. Now he's got to reland the third, opening the door for others. Aurora hovering around that dimple. Aurora has her third ball. It is Aurora with three, Devens working on his third. Devens sticks his third ball again. Once again, Devens on his fourth ball. Ron trying to get back in it. Ron has his third. Aurora, Devens, and Ron each with three, but Devens only needs  to land four. Here comes Devens trying to be nice and easy for the win. Devens knocks his ball out yet again. Now he's got two balls on the move. The challenge is wide open again. Ron with his fourth ball. Aurora now with her fourth ball. <br/>Come on. <br/>Jeff: Devens has his third ball landed again. He's had several shots at the win. Can't do it, keeps knocking his balls off. That ball is moving fast. Can he slow it down? He does. He's close. <br/>Jeff, Jeff, Jeff! I got it. <br/>Jeff: Devens lands his fourth ball. Devens wins individual immunity. <br/>Thank you, David! <br/>Jeff: Safe tonight at tribal council. <br/>Jeff: The advantage pays off. <br/>Damn! <br/>Whooo! <br/>Jeff: Devens, come on over. [ applause ] Devens, safe tonight at tribal council, cannot be  voted out of this game. As for the rest of you, 27 days in, somebody going home tonight. Somebody will be the 11th person voted out of this game. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. Congrats. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I've always thought that Aurora's dangerous because I  think not only is she a challenge beast, but she's somebody that people might  want to bring to the end. Last time she won immunity, and we couldn't vote her out. But I am praying tonight's our chance. <br/>I couldn't even get one. I don't understand how you guys were doing it. <br/>I just win every challenge that has those little white  balls. Last tribal council I lose my closest ally in the game. People were getting blindsided left and right. Tribal has been live so, everybody really wants this baby,  including me. And I'm glad I have it. The. <br/>The fact that he's getting an advantage from the other  side. <br/>I know. <br/>Dangerous. <br/>It's a mute point. <br/>Aurora, it's an easy vote. <br/>She's too good at these immunity challenges. <br/>Yeah, she's too good, too good. I think people when they're in a position of power they want an  easy vote, and this one looks like the most easiest vote. The group of six the target is on Aurora, but she really has no  ties in this game. There are bigger threats out there, so I think it's time to make  a move on the last returning player and that's kellie Wentworth. <br/>What else can she do? She's dead man walking. She knows it. You, me, and Lauren at this point are calling the shots. <br/>To make a move like this against somebody who knows he  well, somebody who has strategized for me for 27 days in had this game,  you've got to be stell. So this morning, I had had 30-second conversations with Aurora, Devens,  and Victoria. <br/>We're doing it tonight. <br/>Doing what? <br/>Wentworth. <br/>Okay. <br/>I can't really be caught talking to because they all want  you out but we're taking out Kelley tonight. <br/>Okay. <br/>Do you think you have the numbers? <br/>Yes. <br/>Ron, that's all we need. <br/>Okay, yeah, dude, music to my ears. <br/>Logically I knew they would work with me. My plan still requires one major convincing. Small concern, right? <br/>Okay. <br/>We can't let a returner get to the final three. <br/>Right. Too good of a story. <br/>Toofgd a story. Coach went to second. Rob won his season. We're all superfans. We can't let that happen. Why can't we take her out tonight? <br/>I can't believe when I'm hearing right now. Wardog is like, "You know, I think it's Kelley. We've got to get her today. We've got to get her out!" he is so unpredictable, and that  scares me. Kelley is definitely the biggest threat, but everyone left in  this game, but if anyone goes home tonight but Aurora, Julie's going to be  furious. And so I've got to be careful about that decision. <br/>It's too easy, isn't it? <br/>Sometimes when it's too easy it makes me nervous that  there's some other plan in play. <br/>Agreed. Agreed. <br/>But...  It doesn't make sense to jump ship at this point. I've always had to be the scrappy underdog, and so now that I'm  in a majority alliance, it is nice because there is just this kind of calm. But, all it takes is one person to be like, "It's time to  get out Wentworth," and they could try and make a move against me. So I'm just so glad I have the safety of a hid hadden immunity  idol right now. <br/>Do you really think he's doing it? <br/>I do. I think he's worried. That he'd lose numbers if he waits too long. <br/>Tonight, either I'm going to be blindsided because yet  again, I've just been told a pointless lie, or Kelley's going home, but I was  given an extra vote from someone on the Edge of Extinction, and could I maybe  use that to try to gather favor? Absolutely. <br/>And I really want to vote with you. If I give you my advantage, and I get voted out, it's yours. I'd like if I come back in, that you give it back, and it's ours  for us. <br/>I will hold it and hand it back to you. <br/>Okay. And if not, good luck in the game, bro. <br/>Okay. <br/>Right before we leave for tribal, Aurora gives me her  extra vote, and instantly my mind goes to a dark place. I could vote her out and if I write down her name, she's gone,  and I keep this vote for myself. So tonight I have two options. I can work with my original alliance to vote out Aurora...  She's got to go. Do you understand what I'm saying? <br/>Yup. Or I can go and work with Wardog, and the three who are on the  outs, to vote out Kelley Wentworth. I love being in the middle and being the decision maker. But I've got quite a dilemma. I want to make sure I make the right call. Because it could be the difference between losing or winning a  million dollars Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. <br/>Jeff: So, Devens, when you look at whose happened so far  in the game, very few people sitting over there on the jury would say,  "Yeah, I knew it was coming." so how do you know it's you that is  about to be blindsided? <br/>When it's you that's being tRicked, I think everything  comes a little too easy. When everything falls into place so perfectly for you, I think  with this group, this season, you have to step back and go, "What am I  missing here?"  Jeff: Victoria, how do you know if you were in on the  conversations? <br/>I mean, I've been in on very little conversations  independent past few days. There was one thing that I've been told, but since Devens won  immunity today, me and Aurora seem to be left as options. <br/>Jeff: Aurora, this is not the first time your name has  come up at tribal. <br/>It's the first time it's come up when I didn't have the  necklace. But there's still options out there. I have to just take all the information in fRont of me and try  and figure out the truth. <br/>Jeff: Ron, there's an idea when had you play a game like  "Survivor" that you have to make your very best move on the  assumption that all the other players are also making their very best move. <br/>Yeah, it makes sense, but once a group of people taste of  blood of a blindside, they become addicted and they want more of it, so  that's why the past few days we put a lot of effort into slid foog a group of  people who won't have to worry about blindsides. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth, does that ring true, there is something  about the blindside that could potentially cloud the game because you just  want another blindside! [ laughter ]  Yeah. When you're part of a blindside, you feel like you were part of  something the other people weren't a part of. So I think there are times when blindsides are necessary, but a  blindside every time isn't always the right decision. <br/>Jeff: Wardog, do you agree with that? <br/>I totally agree with that. Last tribal was not a blindside. David fought for his life, and that was the right decision, and  hopefully more right decisions are made over these next few tribals as well. <br/>Jeff: So, Victoria, 27 days in, if you're not feeling the  love at camp, what do you do? <br/>All the time things flip on their head. The smaller the numbers get, the less stRong some alliances that  have been around for a while will become. Because you can't just go with who you're comfortable with. You really have to start thinking who do I want to sit with at  the end of this game? In that sense, there are a lot more scary people left in this  game than me. <br/>Jeff: So, Wentworth, when is the right time to start  thinking about who do you want to sit next to at the end? <br/>That's a tRicky question. I think people are thinking towards the end game but you also  have to think about who you can trust because if you don't trust people  getting there, you may not get there at all. <br/>Jeff: Devens, there has been one advantage played in the  game by you, and there has been one idol, also played by you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: 27 days in, that's very unusual. <br/>Well, I would first like to thank the beautiful angel that  is David wright who gave me that advantage today. But we scoured every beach we've been to, and no one claims to  have found anything, so I think the group consensus is that the "Edge of  Extinction" is where advantages lie. <br/>Jeff: Ron, anybody that feels on the outs is a vote to be  scooped up. Do you constantly sit back and assess, "Hm, who can I get  to join the flock?"  I think sometimes when you have an alliance you feel  comfortable with, you don't want to do that because if others see you doing  that, then you become suspect. And so sometimes you have to put the pedal down, and sometimes  you need to relax a bit because if you're too aggressive, you become a  threat. <br/>Jeff: Julie, in terms of a game, pedal down or backing  off? <br/>For me, I'm back off. I feel like tonight would be a safe and easy decision to try and  shake things up again would be like rearranging the paintings on the  "Titanic." like, there's no point. <br/>Jeff: All right, it is time to vote. Wentworth, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>I'm very cold. <br/>Jeff: If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want  to play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. First vote, Aurora. Wentworth. Aurora. Aurora. Three votes Aurora. Aurora. That's four votes Aurora. One vote Wentworth. Wentworth. Two votes Wentworth. Wentworth. That's three votes Wentworth. Wentworth. We're tied, four votes Wentworth, four votes, Aurora. One vote left. 11th person voted out and the eighth member of our jury, Wentworth. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Wow, guys. A lot of lying going on. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Good luck. See you soon.

Wardog talked to me like a dog, and I want his head on a silver  platter, could lead to a powerful alliance. Ron, Wardog and I kind of need each other. Or another blindside if I dont work with you now, maybe next  time I'm impressed with how the games moves and the other players. I'm pissed to myself because I had an idol in my pocket  I can't believe I'm that person. I'm that dumb "Survivor" player. Congratulations welcome to the losers lounge. Oh my God, I had an idol. I'm so pissed. And Lauren has the monu one. <br/>She does? <br/>Yeah
