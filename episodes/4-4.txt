<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor: Injuries plagued Rotu while building their raft. <br/>Nice work, butcher. <br/>Okay, okay, okay. <br/>Probst: Go! But it all paid off in the end, as their raft led them to victory at the reward challenge. Rotu! [cheering] Taking advantage of Maraamu's low morale, Rob strategized behind the scenes, and was the puppet master of the tribe. <br/>Fear keeps people loyal. If they're afraid they have something to lose, they're going to do what I tell them to do and not know that I'm telling them to do it. That's straight out of The Godfather. <br/>Probst: Rotu remained untouchable with another victory at the immunity challenge. Immunity. [cheering] Nice job. At Tribal Council, Maraamu followed Rob's lead and voted Hunter off the island. <br/>Good luck, you guys. <br/>Probst: The tribe has spoken. 13 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? [indistinct voices] Without a doubt, I think this is my game, and I'm the one that's controlling it, for the most part. I don't think Hunter saw it coming a mile away. <br/>Need some more... more stuff. <br/>Last night at Tribal Council the four other members decided to vote out Hunter, which I think was a pretty stupid idea. <br/>There you go. You got it. <br/>I think the reason being is because Rob and Sean were tired of having somebody else in a leadership role, and now they're ready to take over. You can see it in what they do. I mean, we come back and we got to build a fire. And I think that was their main motivation in getting him off. I thought I was the one gone. I just want to know why you vote one of your strongest members out. <br/>I think we all probably had a different reason. <br/>I mean I'm glad I'm here. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>'Cause I thought I was going. But I'm just, I'm really just shocked. <br/>Basically just kind of do something different. I'm just like not the big picture. I mean, the game has no rules. <br/>I know, I mean, we talked, and I told you why we voted on each other. So I just, if you guys want to tell me, that's fine. If not, then, that's fine, too. I'm just asking. Nobody had a good explanation, no one. Sarah's explanation was she just felt like, you know, she had two people and that's who she wanted to vote on. Well, Rob voted on that person, that's why she voted on him. She doesn't think for herself, Rob tells her what to vote on. <br/>I don't know, it's hard to explain what I was thinking. You thought you were the one to go? <br/>I mean, I thought it would be stupid to vote him out. <br/>I'm glad I voted the way I did. <br/>After seeing the votes I'm glad I voted the way I did, too. <br/>They think it's the beginning of Maraamu-- I have no idea. I hope it's not the end, because I don't want to go. I'll be the next to go. If we lose, I'm gone. They're not going to keep somebody like me around. <br/>This is a big pig tail in the back. <br/>A big pig tail? <br/>A big braided pig tail. <br/>Yeah, like a Barbie doll thing. <br/>Oh, yeah. Perfect. <br/>Let me see. There you go! <br/>Thanks, babe. <br/>I jammed. <br/>You did, you did a great job. <br/>No lumps. <br/>Good morning, buddy. <br/>This tribe is a family. We've said that from day one. I don't know that the mood could be any better. It's just a real calm, peaceful feeling. It's just family pride here, and I don't think the other team has that. <br/>I think as every day passes here, I think our tribe is beginning to find more of its groove. People are beginning to relax a little bit. I mean, yesterday was honestly the best day I've had here. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Hey, buddy. <br/>This tribe is unbelievable. The reason we keep winning is because of the unity and love that is in this tribe. It's an unreal experience to see eight people coming together every single day to provide for each other, not just rally around each other for a challenge, but every single day doing an activity that will provide for the rest of the group. <br/>I am preparing toasted coconut. There was a discovery last night by the infamous, infamous Chef, John, to try and make our food taste better, and we just happened to discover that the coconut just got burned on the bottom of the pan and it tasted really good. <br/>Survivor snacks. It's warm, so be careful. Is it good? <br/>Oh! Let's just make that every two hours on the two hours. <br/>The bottom line is, everybody in this tribe likes each other and respects each other as individuals. Whether we wanted it or not, we've become a second sort of family. And it's a good thing, it works for us. <br/>We have mail! for us. <br/>We have mail! <br/>Okay. Here we go. Listen up. "Challenges of brain and brawn are nothing compared to this. Your world will turn, your head will spin, as you stand upon the disk." Might be like a wheel of fortune. <br/>Into the water? <br/>Could be like if you get dizzy or not. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Today's mail was a disk, it was a wooden disk. We kind of, like, threw some ideas around, but then we decided we're just going to shut up and wait. In a nutshell, we've assumed every single one. We have been wrong on every single one. So maybe today when we go in there, expecting the unexpected, who knows? <br/>Here's where the game gets really interesting. <br/>Probst: Hello, guys. <br/>Hello. <br/>What's up? <br/>Probst: All right. Today is not a reward challenge or an immunity challenge, but it is an activity of sorts, and certainly some of you will be rewarded and others no doubt, as always, will go back disappointed. Let's begin. Okay. First step, pick a disk, doesn't matter, it's totally random. Follow your gut. Go wherever you want. Okay. Go wherever you want. Okay. Zoe, you're first. Step off your disk. Flip it over. Pull off your new buff. Take your old one off. Put your new one on. Nothing changes for you, you're still on Rotu. Put it on, and take a spot over here. Gina, you're next. No harm, no foul, still with Maraamu. Gabe. Pick a spot on your new mat. You're still Rotu. Neleh. First change. Now part of Maraamu. Take a spot on the mat with Gina. <br/>Welcome. <br/>Probst: John. No change. You're still with Rotu. Take a spot on the mat. V... here goes. Swap out, you're now a member of Rotu. <br/>God is still good, regardless. <br/>Probst: Say hi to your new tribe members. <br/>What's up, babies? <br/>Probst: Rob. You're now a member of Rotu. <br/>Hi, Robster. <br/>Probst: Kathy... you're now a member of Maraamu. Say hello to your new tribe mates. Sean. You're now a member of Rotu. <br/>Sean, man. <br/>John. <br/>Probst: Sarah. Okay, Sarah, same buff, still a member of Maraamu. <br/>What's up, ladies? <br/>The chicks, man! The chicks are here! <br/>It's all about the chicks. <br/>Yes, Sarah, Kathy, Neleh. <br/>Probst: Robert, you're up. You're a member of Rotu. The new Rotu. <br/>Hey, Rob. <br/>What's up, man? <br/>What's up, man? <br/>It's going to be all women. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Probst: Paschal. <br/>All right! <br/>Yeah, pappy's on our team! <br/>We got pappy. <br/>Probst: You're now a member of Maraamu. <br/>Nice to meet you. <br/>You, too. <br/>Probst: All right, Tammy, you're last. Join your new tribe. <br/>What's up, tribe? <br/>What's up, sweetie? <br/>So good! It's good to get to know new people. <br/>Welcome, guys. How you doing? <br/>Probst: All right. These are the new tribes. Maraamu, Rotu. The number of tribe members in each tribe hasn't changed, just the members within the tribe. And let me assure you that like everything else in this game, this part of your destiny was planned long before you guys even got to the Marquesas Islands. I have no doubt that some of you are probably looking at this as a reprieve, others may see it as a sentence. It is neither. It's just the game. I'll see you guys tomorrow. <br/>What's your name? Tammy? <br/>I'm Rob. <br/>Rob. <br/>Sean. <br/>Nice to meet you. <br/>Sean, baby. [sobbing gently] It's good, it's good. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>It's good, it's good. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>This is our new house, you guys. <br/>This is so beautiful. <br/>Let's show you guys around. <br/>What is this here? <br/>This is the breadfruit, this is a mango tree. <br/>When we got back for the first time the new group, it was interesting, we walked around and showed them the fruit trees that we had. So all you got to do is pick up the limes off the ground. <br/>There's a rooster. <br/>Their limes are on the ground! Hello! <br/>Yeah, there's a rooster. It was very exhilarating to actually see some people who didn't want to just sit around and be lazy. <br/>You guys, check out this grapefruit tree! There's zillions of them. [laughing] Strawberries. <br/>Oh! <br/>Watch your head! <br/>Whoo-whee! <br/>I just came from a tribe that would get up at dawn, check the pig pit, you know, and go out and forage for shells. So to us we feel like we're at a four-star hotel, that there's fruit on the table. So it's pretty nice. <br/>You guys, look at all the fruit! [indistinct voices] Didn't you say you have mangos, too? <br/>Oh, heck, you guys. Grapefruit just made my whole entire day. <br/>It was nice to get away, you know, and see some new scenery. The beach here is beautiful. And the fruit definitely by far outdoes everything over at Rotu. I would have chosen here over that place for the fruit. <br/>So, what do you all do in real life? <br/>I was a teacher until this year, and then I took off. I'm bartending, saving money for grad school. <br/>Oh, cool. Yeah. <br/>I'm a real estate broker, but I'm going back to school, changing careers. <br/>Are you? For what? <br/>Environmental studies. <br/>That's what I'm doing! <br/>Come on. <br/>Get out of here! <br/>Gina and Kathy right away had something in common. They're both all about the environment and want to go hiking and do all that. So that was good. Gina found someone right away. We have a morning show every morning. Sean is really, really funny. We each had a part in the morning show. I was the beauty. She was the sports report, Hunter was the, uh, helicopter weather guy. <br/>Hunter's the one they voted off last night. <br/>Last night. I thought... we called him surfer boy. We thought he'd make it until the end, dude. <br/>He was, yeah, he was strong, he was a hard worker. He was everything. Just the four people decided just, for whatever reason to... Really? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Nicest guy in the world. <br/>I thought the tribe that had been here was lazy. And fortunately, those members are no longer around, from what I understand. Having said that, the fruit situation over here, which we did not have over there, has made everything just worthwhile so far. Oh, man! <br/>I'd rather eat this than fish any day. <br/>Cheers. <br/>To our new little family. <br/>Nice little crib's better To our new little family. <br/>Nice little crib's better than the projects. <br/>Yeah. <br/>So what is the routine of the day? What do you guys normally do? <br/>Up at dawn. <br/>Make sure we have water and food. <br/>Okay. After the challenge we got three new tribe members. We got V, we got Rob and we got Sean. I couldn't have been happier when they switched us up. I love the people that I was part of the first original eight with, but I was also thrilled to get some new people in our tribe. <br/>This is our coconut popcorn. <br/>Oh, yeah, try that. <br/>You gotta try that. It's really good. <br/>You guys hungry? Want to get some taro cooking? <br/>That has flavor to it! <br/>When we landed here on Rotu camp, I truly felt that there was a genuine welcome. But I also felt that their expectation was for us to just jump right in. Because everybody was immediately on their jobs. <br/>You guys want to go get some limes? Will that be on the way to the waterfall? <br/>We've been getting 40 limes a day, and we've been going through them. <br/>We noticed immediately these people were like ants! <br/>One. <br/>They were... and we're standing there like... right now we'd be chilling, you know? Work done in the morning. Afternoon, chill, the rest of the day. I tell you, at the other camp we never even fired up our frying pan. Everything was sliced, slurp, toss. <br/>Those are our nicknames. <br/>Johnny Pots and Pans. Xena. <br/>Tonga. <br/>Scoop. <br/>The General. <br/>Scoop, Scoop and the General, right. <br/>At this point, I'm really not sure how I'm going to overcome the numerical advantage that they hold. Having five members stay and us being the three newcomers. The biggest thing now is going to be to see how I'm going to be able to bond with these other people. Gabe seems pretty cool, he's definitely a brainiac. He probably thinks he's a lot smarter than he really is. When I first saw John, I thought he was a big-time queer. I really don't know, he seems kind of rough and tough over here, but he does all the cooking. So I don't know, I won't be sleeping next to him tonight, not the first night, anyway. The General seems like a nice guy, also. He's big and tough, and wants everybody to know that. Probably got a little sausage. Tammy is engaged, there's not too much hope there. And Zoe is pretty nice, but... come on. Without a doubt, Zoe is definitely the toughest guy in this tribe. I don't think this is the type of group where I can jump in and joke around and just be all outlandish and stuff like I could in the other group. Definitely the game is changing, and maybe for the better. Maybe for the worse. I don't know. <br/>All right, the map! <br/>And I am embarrassed to say, I don't know how to pronounce this tribe. <br/>Maraamu. <br/>Maraamu. <br/>Maraamu. <br/>Is that... Where's your water, right there? Our water's way up here. <br/>We walked up the trail and got water-- unbelievable to actually see somebody want to go get water. <br/>Go ahead, mama. <br/>All rightie. <br/>So there is a new lease on life. I stayed with Maraamu, but I got three new tribe members that totally kick butt. <br/>Hunter and I, we got water, we got food, everything. And he was so awesome. We had so much in common. He was the nicest guy in the world. I mean, I thought it was me going last night. So, it shocked the hell out of me. I mean, I can't believe they got rid of Hunter, and then they jumped down my throat for asking why they did it. Lazy, lazy. This is our water, guys. <br/>That's the water. <br/>You guys would die if you saw where we got water from. [laughing] I'm in shock. Sorry, I usually jump in to jobs. <br/>But water is water when it's boiled, so... Oh, no, I know. It's just the exact opposite of what we got. Isn't that funny? It's very interesting being away from Rotu. Because that tribe is just workaholics, and... It's just weird being here. Because it's so kicked back. <br/>The guys are definitely going to be... Oh, the guys will be in heaven. <br/>I don't know, there's not that much shellfish. <br/>We're very happy with what has turned out to be. I know they're a little disappointed because they had it so well and their tribe was so close, but since they have the majority of the people they could just pick off people on each tribe. And I definitely would not mind it if that happened on the other side. They deserve what they get. <br/>All right, so just start some piles. <br/>How much wood is this for, for the entire day we're collecting? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Pretty much, life over here is about two degrees shy of hell. It's absolutely terrible. It's a night and day difference between the other camp. These people are workaholics, that's all they want to do. They don't give you a second to breathe. Every two seconds somebody is asking you to do something else. <br/>We can dig this one up, this one's a good one, but we do need to make a new one. I don't like this one very much. It's not steep enough. <br/>Why give in to this bull crap? That's all it is. <br/>Believe me, I worked construction for years, man. I know what it's like to dig ditches. <br/>Really? <br/>It's hard to do it with shovels, let alone with freaking oars and paddles, man. <br/>I feel like we're doing too much labor on this island. Definitely feel like the master is watching. I'm like, slavery has been over. I feel like we're in the woods. I hear the Rootstheme as we speak. Hear it? By the end of the night, I'm so tired all I want to do is lay down, you know. I want to sit around the fire. So, Rob, how do you feel about being over here? <br/>To tell you the truth, I really don't enjoy this part of the island. Yeah, the women over here don't look half as good as they did at our other tribe. <br/>Oh, no, the women on our island had big boobs with tiny bikinis. <br/>Over here, I think we got eight guys on the island. We got eight guys and one girl. I think her name is John. <br/>I don't know anything about that one. <br/>Ah, here's one of my favorite girls right here. Hmm, Tammy? <br/>You just like me because I bring you food. <br/>That's right. <br/>Take a handful, and I'll bring it over to the other guys. <br/>Tammy knows the deal. <br/>Tammy knows what's up. <br/>Thank you, Tammy. <br/>Thank you, babe. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>Now see, see... We could've used her on the island. <br/>She's all right. Long as she keeps serving, she'll do fine. <br/>Minute she stops... See ya later. <br/>...she's out. <br/>If Sean and Rob decide not to work, we will still feed them, but their asses will be gone, first vote. <br/>Tomorrow, I think me and you should go on a hike and basically, what we'll do is, we'll go around that corner over there, and we'll chill out all day. What do you think? Cool? <br/>This morning, we got up. What do you think? Cool? <br/>This morning, we got up. We started a little fire. Decided we were going to go for a hike. Filled up some water bottles, and then took off around the trail. I look like I have the measles. <br/>You ready, pappy? <br/>I'm ready. <br/>All right, you want to carry a water? <br/>Sarah, are you okay? a water? <br/>Sarah, are you okay? <br/>Yeah, why? <br/>Sarah just strolls. She's a stroller. <br/>Kathy decided she was going to take lead, and somewhere along the way we missed a trail or something, but we got sidetracked and basically got lost. <br/>Yeah, we're too high now. We've got to traverse down. We're going to backtrack just to be safe, instead of sliding down. <br/>All right. <br/>Everybody enjoyed it up to a point. And then I think people started getting tired of the long hike and wondering if we were getting lost. They weren't used to bushwhacking. I was used to it, so I was feeling rather confident that we'll be okay. We either go to the lagoon or we go back down and up and try to find that trail. But why don't we move over a little bit further? <br/>I'm game. Go ahead. Neleh and Paschal, I think, were very irritated. Sometimes I see that Kathy gets on their nerves just because she is so aggressive. And they're not aggressive people; they're very passive. <br/>They're back there. I'm not waiting. Sorry. <br/>They were irritated with her because she wanted to go on, and that might tend to break down after a while their bond that they have. <br/>It was hard going, somewhat. But we finally found this very, very deep rock pool. <br/>There is the biggest shrimp, you guys. <br/>Look at that shrimp, you guys, hurry, look. <br/>It's huge. <br/>Oh, my God. I don't know if that is. Is that a shrimp? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's a shrimp. <br/>Whoa! <br/>There's five huge ones right there. <br/>We found a bubbling brook, and there was a pool there with pretty good-sized shrimp, maybe, you know, three-to-four-inch size shrimp. Neleh decided it would be nice to try and catch some shrimps. <br/>Oh, wow, there's a nice one. <br/>Dang it! <br/>Sarah basically just sat on the shore the whole time scratching her legs, and really not doing much of anything to help with the food situation. <br/>I'll see you guys in a little bit. <br/>All right. Be careful. <br/>See you. <br/>Sarah decided that she was getting eaten pretty bad by the no-nos, so she decided she wanted to leave and head on back to camp. We truly didn't care, she wasn't doing anything, anyway. <br/>I have lost an extreme amount of weight, and I'm getting very weak and the bug bites are driving me absolutely insane. I thought I was going to come back to camp and cut my legs off with a machete. <br/>Gina, can you hear me? <br/>Sarah's lost. <br/>How far up here is the trail? Do you remember? <br/>I don't even know where you're at. Sarah basically just couldn't find her way back, so she came back. <br/>Apparently, I'm not going anywhere. <br/>Sarah likes to sit back. I think that's probably her thing-- she doesn't participate. But Neleh, and Paschal and obviously Gina and myself are willing to explore and get some food other than just plucking it off a tree. <br/>Yes! <br/>Got another one? <br/>Two. <br/>She got two nice ones. [squeals] Guys, how is it? <br/>Great, thank you. <br/>Want a little bit more? <br/>Yeah. Thank you so much. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>Thank you, Tammy. <br/>I'm telling you, as your friend, man, they're already five strong. And their group... their group is real tight, I mean... What we can do is win the next challenges and ensure that we stay here, but me you and V are going to get picked off one by one, anyway. <br/>Whoo! <br/>These five have been here before us. They're a strong knit group, we're going to be the first to go if they have to vote anyway. So there's nothing you can do to try to prove yourself. And if you don't kiss butt, like I don't plan to do, then you just know that your butt is next. If I'm the next one voted off, so be it. But I tell you, I can't hold my mouth for too long. They are definitely going to know where Sean is coming from. We're not going to overexert ourselves knowing we're coming into a situation where we may get voted off anyway. We're not trying to prove nothing. We're trying to fit in, have fun while we do it. And whatever game y'all five got going... Listen, listen, I want you to, I want you to... I mean, you're going to think what you're going to think. <br/>I hear you, but the thing is, we're not going to run around here like slaves to prove anything to anybody. That's why we're going to rest when we want to rest. Y'all are Clydesdales. Every last one of you all are getting up every five seconds... [panting]: "Yeah, I'm going to go 50-mile hiking. Okay, let's cut up some coconut and let's cut this up." Let's sit our butts down and freaking relax! Man, I'm getting tired of this working around. I'm a grown man out here. I'm going to be real with you. <br/>I want you to be real... I didn't come out here for all of this. I'm getting tired of this bull. We're not tip toeing around a mother out here, and I'm coming out my shell, telling you right now. The bottom line, if y'all are going to vote us off, vote us off. <br/>What do you think about all this, V.? <br/>It's too much damn drama for me. You know, I'm down with you guys. I'm going to be with you regardless, you know that. But as far as the chitchat and the drama, bump that. I ain't with it. Stay drama-free, and that's the way to be. You know, when the drama starts, I walk away. If my name's not in it, then I'm not in it. <br/>So, this challenge thing. Oh, God. It's gonna be interesting. Oh, I just love tree mail. "Look for the pattern or you may be leaving. The key to victory is all in the weaving. You need to be wary of the time you're using. If you take too long, eviction is looming." Oh, God, thank God my weaving skills are good. How about you? <br/>I know, good. <br/>Oh... Sarah... Sarah. <br/>We got tree mail. <br/>What's it say? <br/>You want to come up here? <br/>I think Rotu is going to do something. I think they'll back off. If they don't like the people that came over, I can see that tribe backing off on a challenge. Just taking it slower, maybe allowing us to win, just so they have the opportunity to vote somebody off. <br/>One, two, three, Maraamu! <br/>That just sounds weird. <br/>It does sound weird. <br/>Probst: Okay. First things first. Give it up, Gabe. New tribes, maybe new energy around the immunity idol, or maybe it goes back home with Rotu once again. Okay, today's immunity challenge is all about the weaving. Each of you have a woven tapestry that is scrambled, it's very simple. The first tribe to unscramble it correctly wins immunity, guarantees themselves three more days on the island, and you're one step closer to a million bucks. Losing tribe, Tribal Council tonight with me. For somebody, life on the island will be over. Big enough stakes, I'm sure. Rotu, you need to sit out three members. Sean, John, Rob. All right, you guys are sitting out. Take your spots, and we'll go. Survivors ready! Go! <br/>It's oriented, it's oriented... Pull back around the bottom. Pull back around the bottom. Pull your way. Go the other way, the other direction. That's it. That's the bottom piece, three dashes, three dashes on the bottom. <br/>Three dashes... Keep going, keep going, this way, this is it. <br/>Good. <br/>Okay? <br/>We got to do this one. <br/>Which way, that way? <br/>Let's start with the eyeball. <br/>We need to kind of figure out the design. <br/>Okay, so pull and push on that eyeball. <br/>Here's the eyeball, right here. <br/>Okay. <br/>Look. <br/>Yeah, but I think we should be working on this quadrant. <br/>That matched, babe. <br/>No, it didn't. <br/>Yeah, it did. The eyeballs were perfect. <br/>Pull, pull, pull! <br/>Okay, now line up this one. <br/>Go that way, go that way first and see what we got. <br/>It's going to line up the other side, right there. <br/>Yep, yep, yep! <br/>Let's get this one. <br/>Need the black line, so there. Okay, there. Now that one on the end. <br/>Yeah, we're looking for three lines. <br/>Here they come. <br/>Easy, easy, easy, easy. <br/>You got it, you got it. It's cool. <br/>This is it right here. Lined up with the eye right here, okay. <br/>That's it. That's it. <br/>Keep on moving down. <br/>You guys just have to keep working. I, you know... We're looking for the eyeballs. <br/>The top is supposed to be striped, just like that. <br/>Okay, so this is the top, we got eyeballs here. See this little grid pattern? <br/>Here's the actual eyeball. Right. <br/>There's lots of eyeballs. <br/>Yep. Okay, work with that eyeball right there. Those aren't lining up. <br/>This one is the top of the eyeball right here. This one doesn't fit. <br/>The eyeball should be at the top. <br/>Maybe it's the middle. <br/>I think it should go the other way. <br/>Up and down we're good. Tammy. <br/>We're looking for this block right here. <br/>All right, we'll line this up-- keep going, keep going. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. There, that's the piece. That's it, all right, excellent. <br/>We're going this way now. <br/>Horizontal. All right, line up the very top one, work on the very top one. Finish those eyes at the top. Okay, now do the next one down. <br/>Yeah, pull to you. <br/>That's it, that's it. That's it. <br/>I think it should go the other way. <br/>Back the other way? <br/>Go back and see what it looks like. <br/>Yeah, there is stripes at the bottom. <br/>You guys need to be working, too. I think we need to be both pulling and pushing, come on. I think this way is kind of strange. Here, what about this one? <br/>Okay, that's good, we're matched over here. <br/>But then this doesn't look... Okay, work with that eyeball right there. I think this is matched right here. <br/>That's the center piece, all right, and now this one to fix. Give me slack. <br/>Wait. <br/>Here it comes. <br/>Here it comes. <br/>Okay, keep going, keep going. That side piece. <br/>Right there, where you are. <br/>Back corner, right there. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Try it through till you line that piece up again. <br/>Pull. <br/>Here it comes, here it comes. <br/>Keep pulling, pull. Slow, slow, slow. That's it. <br/>That's it. <br/>That's it right there. <br/>Rotu! <br/>Probst: Rotu. [cheering] All right! <br/>Probst: Rotu, nice job once again. <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>Probst: She's never felt that before. [cheering] Maraamu, Tribal Council. For three of you, that'll be a new experience. Not a pleasant one, I assure you. You guys can head straight back out this way. [cheering] Oh! <br/>Touche! <br/>You know, Rotu just has this heat on their breath that they... [growling] You know, they were just... "We're going to get it." And that's the way they do their challenges. Just with that fierce determination. <br/>Definitely doesn't feel good to lose, that's for sure. As usual, Maraamu is heading back to Tribal Council tonight. This is our fourth time. I'm kind of used to it. But I still hate it. I'm not looking forward to it, at all. And it's a little unnerving, because we are outnumbered. Sarah, I think, has kind of pretty much given up. I think she probably knows that she's going to go. I don't know that, 'cause the type of person she is, she might not have a clue. <br/>I'm definitely not giving up, but it's so hard to say with the five people we have now who's going to go, because we're all getting along so good. The one vote that I probably will have will be for Kathy, and it's because she's been very overbearing and motherly to me. Even though that may just be her personality, I don't know how long I could stand that. <br/>Fire's done. <br/>Warm... it's hot in here. <br/>Kathy, she's a hard-working woman. She is very energetic, very outgoing, I mean, she's out here for the kill. You know, she just wants to get things done. In the beginning of our challenge, she was kind of barking out orders and she's kind of really uptight about everything. She wants it done here and now. Go get the fire started, and she kind of like, almost panics. You know, so it kind of puts the rest of us into this panic stage. <br/>That's fine, I just feel better now. [chuckles] No problem. <br/>And who knows? I mean, I was walking today saying, "Kath, you just never know, you know? You might get voted off." Probst: Neleh and Paschal and Kathy, because this is your first Tribal Council, we have a little ritual. Behind each of you is a personalized tribal torch. Why don't you go ahead and grab it, approach the flame and light it up. The reason for the ritual? At Tribal Council, fire represents your life in this game. So you'll take these torches back with you to camp and you'll bring them to all future Tribal Councils. As long as you have fire, you remain on the island. When your fire is gone, so are you. As will be the case tonight for one of the five of you. A lot has changed in the last couple days. Paschal, what was your reaction to the switch? <br/>Well, initially I was kind of shocked, because I wasn't prepared for it. After we got back it was like being thrown in a briar patch. They like taking care of an old man pretty well. <br/>Probst: So it worked out all right for you? <br/>Worked out great. <br/>Probst: Gina, how about you? Nothing changed in terms of tribe name, but certainly tribe members. <br/>It was awesome, it was probably one of the better days that I've had out here, to be honest with you. <br/>Probst: Do you think you were in danger of being voted out if the tribe Maraamu had remained the same? <br/>I would have been the next to go if the tribe had stayed the same, definitely. <br/>Probst: So you're not missing the old tribe members? <br/>Not really. <br/>Probst: Kathy, what was your reaction as people were pulling one buff out and putting a new one on? <br/>I was not happy, you know, I was disappointed. I mean, Rotu's a strong team. I'm a competitor, I-I just couldn't believe it. I mean, the range of emotions were just vast. Angry, sad. Oh, my God, what's going to happen next? I had no idea. So it was just, you know, pulling the rug right out from under me. <br/>Probst: Do you feel like you're with the losers now? <br/>I don't feel like it's the losers. I just think it's a new era almost. So right now we're just enjoying ourselves and trying to regain some new spirit for the next challenges. <br/>Probst: Neleh? What was your reaction? <br/>I had a tough time at first, especially, I mean, when I flipped over my log, you know, I saw two of our really strong tribe members go onto the green mat and I knew I to walk to yellow. I was just really bummed out. I just sat there waiting patiently, hoping that some more of the, you know, the people would come over. I just didn't know what to expect, so I was very, very, disappointed at first. <br/>Probst: Has that changed? <br/>Yeah, I mean, once I got there, it's beautiful. The white sand beach is amazing there. I got to meet some new people, which was really nice. So every day things are getting better and better. <br/>Probst: How about for you, Sarah-- reaction? <br/>It was definitely a shocker. It was a good thing, though. I was glad to get to know some new people, new faces, new energy. It's been a good thing, though. <br/>Probst: Okay, it's time to vote. Kathy, you're first. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Sarah. Kathy. Sarah. Sarah. That's a majority vote, no need to read the last vote. Sarah, you need to bring me your torch. Sarah, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. <br/>Thanks. <br/>This game is unpredictable. To stay in it you have to adapt. I give you guys credit for doing that. You may be a new tribe, but you are a tribe. You guys can take your torches and head back to camp. I'll see you tomorrow. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor,Maraamu finds a new spirit. <br/>It's the first time I felt as though I had been on a real team. <br/>Probst: At Rotu, suspicion and doubt cause the love tribe to fracture. <br/>Are we staying tight? Is that the deal? Are we trying to put Rotu back together? <br/>Probst: And one tribe will have a chance to devastate the competition. The winning tribe gets to raid the losing tribe's camp. <br/>Wow. <br/>I'm getting kind of emotional right now, which I didn't think I would do. But I'm excited for the people that get to go back and finish the game and do what they have been doing very well. And I hope that my original seven other teammates, Rob and Sean and V and Gina, especially, do very, very, well, and I hope they're having a great time.
