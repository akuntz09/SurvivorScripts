<br/>Jeff Probst: 27 days ago, two tribes of ten castaways each began an epic  battle. The purple tribe, Galu, won almost every encounter. Galu wins immunity! By the time the two tribes merged, the yellow tribe, Foa Foa, was down to  four. The old Galu had eight, and they planned to keep it that way. <br/>What's Samoan for "Get the hell off my island"? <br/>Look at us. We're like savages. <br/>Probst: But the old Foa Foa losses sharpened their ability to strategize. <br/>Things are about to change totally in this game. I don't think they even realize it right now. We're steps ahead of them. We already have our plan down. <br/>Probst: And the plan worked. At the next two Tribal Councils, two of the old Galu went home. But the old Foa Foa paid a price-- Russell had to play his hidden immunity  idol. Then three game-changing events took place. One, Russell found another hidden immunity idol. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Two, Shambo agreed to vote with the Foa Foa four to take out Laura. <br/>It is the destiny of Laura to go home. <br/>Probst: And, three, John agreed to switch his vote, hoping that Russell would  vote out a Foa Foa next. <br/>Next one needs to be Foa Foa. Deal? <br/>Okay. That's a deal. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, John changed his vote. The ninth person voted out and the third member of our jury. And Laura made it three of the And Laura made it three of the old Galus in a  row. old Galus in a row. <br/>Probst: And now, the entire tribe is about to find out if the old Foa Foa is  as good at holding on to a lead as they are at getting one. Nine are left. Nine are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? [chickens clucking] [chickens clucking]  Medusa has been dethroned. Is that just hysterical? [snickering]  At Tribal tonight, Laura went home. The vote was 5-5. The rules of Survivorsay that if there is another tie after a second round of  voting, the remaining members would choose rocks. One of those rocks would be of a different color, and that person would go  home. I'm not going to go home because of ridiculous rocks. I gave multiple, multiple explanations and multiple rationale for why we  should be making different decisions, and no dice. I had a conversation with Russell in which he and I said the next person to  go would be Foa Foa. So right now, I think I have a pretty good position. What's funny is, collectively, they made the correct move, and I made the  correct move. <br/>We all want to make it to the end, but at some point, you need to show  loyalty and integrity and respect for the people that you made promises to. When it came down to it tonight...  Uh-huh. <br/>I still could not flop for Laura. I definitely have come to see John as little bit more as a Judas of the Galu  tribe. Then John has to go home. Then John has to go home. âª âª  Tree mail. <br/>Oh, happy day! <br/>Oh, y'all going to be happy about this. You might as well get up. <br/>Is it food? <br/>You're kidding me, dude! <br/>Open it up first. <br/>Eh. <br/>Oh! [belly-laugh]  Cold cash money! <br/>Yeah! [cheering]  "Going once, going twice, gone. This should be some fun. Play is right and you just may have a full belly by the time it's done."   Food auction! <br/>We just got a tree mail. We got money, baby! Money means food, so I'm really excited about that 'cause I'm literally  starving. So I know definitely I'm eating off my muscle of my body, so off my muscle of  my body, so today is a really good day. today is a really good day. today is a really good day. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. I love seeing so many smiles. [laughter] Welcome to the Survivor auction. You've each been given $500. Bidding will be in increments of $20. There is no sharing of money. No sharing of food. Auction will end without warning. If you see something you like, bid on it. Ready to get started? <br/>ALL: Yes. <br/>Probst: First item. Shall I uncover it or cover it? <br/>ALL: Uncover it. <br/>Probst: Peanut butter and jelly sandwich. <br/>Ooh. <br/>$200. [Dave whistles]  Holy cow! <br/>Probst: Natalie, knowing that the bidding goes in increments of $20, jumps to  $200. <br/>Yes. <br/>She just bought herself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, Jeff. <br/>It's yours, Nat. <br/>Probst: $200 going once, twice. [gavel bangs] Sold to Natalie. Come on up. All right, Natalie, $200 bought you a PB &amp; J. Take a little bite right here. <br/>Oh, my goodness. Look at all this peanut butter. Mmm! Totally worth the $200. <br/>Probst: All right, take it back. Enjoy it. <br/>Thank you. [Monica gasps]  Wow! <br/>That has a lot of peanut butter in it! <br/>Good girl. <br/>Probst: Next item will remain covered. <br/>$80. <br/>Probst: $80 to Jaison. <br/>$100. $100 to Monica. <br/>$120. <br/>$140. <br/>$120 to John, $140 to Jaison. <br/>$200. <br/>Probst: $200 to Shambo. $200. <br/>I'll go $220. <br/>Probst: $220 to Dave. <br/>$240. <br/>Probst: $240 to Shambo. Going once, twice. [gavel bangs] Sold to Shambo. $240 for the mystery item. <br/>What did I get? <br/>Probst: Give me the money first. <br/>Okay, baby. <br/>Show me the money! <br/>Done. <br/>Probst: $240 bought you a Survivorversion of spaghetti. <br/>Oh, really? <br/>Probst: Sea noodles and slug guts. <br/>ALL: Aw...  Oh, dude! <br/>Probst: To go. <br/>Yum! Thank you. <br/>Probst: With a little bit of parmesan. <br/>Nice! <br/>Probst: To bring out the flavor. <br/>Good stuff. <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Huh. <br/>Does it have, like, nutritional starch value, do you know? <br/>Probst: I don't. <br/>God, I hope it does 'cause my body is really deprived. <br/>Probst: Let's just say it does. All right, Shambo. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Enjoy. <br/>Probst: Enjoy. Next item. It's so much fun to keep them covered. <br/>$300. <br/>Probst: Right off the bat, Dave Ball says $300... for a covered item. <br/>$320. <br/>They're playing... They're playing the odds right now. <br/>$340. <br/>Probst: What are the chances we would put back-to-back bad items? <br/>Very, very strong chances. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>That's what I think. <br/>Probst: Monica at $340. Going once, going twice. Sold to Monica for $340. <br/>I hope this is good, Jeff. <br/>Probst: So do I. [laughter]  Please, please, please, please, please be good. <br/>Probst: Well, it cost you a lot. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Probst: I hope you think it was worth it. <br/>Oh! [Monica laughs]  Wow! <br/>Probst: A whole roasted chicken. <br/>Oh! Oh, my God! <br/>Damn! <br/>Wow! [Dave laughs]  Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, gee. <br/>Probst: Next item. This is a significant advantage in the next immunity challenge. <br/>Hundj. <br/>Probst: $100 to John. <br/>$140. <br/>$140 to Natalie. <br/>$200. <br/>Probst: $200 to John. You have a one in nine shot in this game right now. This could make it one in eight. <br/>$260. <br/>Probst: Jaison in on it at $260. <br/>$300. <br/>Probst: $300 to John. <br/>I thought, uh, when John was bidding on the item that would do well in the  challenge that we needed to be in possession of that item. Maybe it was my turn to, you know, sacrifice a little bit for the good of the  former Foa Foa. I... Can I ask you a question before I bid? We both have 500 bucks. What if we both bid $500? <br/>Probst: Somebody's going to get to $500 first. <br/>Yeah. <br/>So it's whoever gets to $500 first? <br/>Probst: Yeah. <br/>500 bucks. <br/>Probst: 500 bucks. <br/>All right, Jaison! <br/>Probst: Sold to Jaison. <br/>Playing like a true lawyer. <br/>Probst: Keep this sealed. Bring it to the next immunity challenge. You will open it there. We'll find out if it was worth it. <br/>Nice move. <br/>Probst: So Jaison spends all his money on one item, and that means no food. Next item. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, my word! <br/>Oh! <br/>$500. <br/>Mick, yeah! Get them! <br/>Probst: Wow! Mick just closed down the bidding with one bid of $500. <br/>Here you go. <br/>Probst: Sold to Mick as Jaison buries his head in his hands. <br/>Good job, Mick. <br/>Oh, my God, that was hilarity. <br/>Probst: That's a cheeseburger, fries, ketchup, mustard...  Ugh! <br/>Probst: ...cold beer. Enjoy. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Holy cow! [Jaison groans]  Nice job, bro. <br/>Probst: Jaison? <br/>Yeah? <br/>Probst: Second thoughts? <br/>Sitting here right now and seeing you uncover that thing, yeah, second,  third, fourth, fifth, tenth thoughts, like, "I want that hamburger. I want it badly." [Shambo laughs]  Probst: Next item. A clue to the location of the hidden immunity idol. <br/>$100. <br/>$120. <br/>$200. <br/>Probst: $120 to Natalie. $200 to John. Only one thing keeps you safe in this game, and that is immunity. $200 to John. Going once, going twice. Sold to John. <br/>Nice job, Johnnie. <br/>Nice one, buddy. <br/>Excuse moi. Russell may have the idol, you know. Anyone can. <br/>Probst: Take it with you. Open this back at camp. <br/>I'm not going to sit here and go, "I'm gonna let the immunity go. Someone else can buy that." Absolutely not. Immunity is the goal. <br/>Probst: Next item-- you've been looking at it. It's the Survivorshower. <br/>$100. <br/>Probst: Which John has bid $100 on already. Shampoo, conditioner, clean underwear. <br/>Clean underwear. $120. <br/>Probst: $100 to John. $120 to Natalie. <br/>Go ahead and get in there, girl. <br/>Probst: $120 to Natalie going once, twice. Sold to Natalie-- $120. <br/>Oh, do it, girl. <br/>No one wants to see old John take a shower. <br/>Probst: Here's your towel. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Enjoy your shower. <br/>Oh, yes. Oh, my goodness. <br/>Whoo! [laughter]  Oh, my goodness. <br/>Probst: Next item-- let's uncover. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: One gigantic piece of apple pie. <br/>$180. <br/>$300. <br/>Probst: $180 to Brett. $300 to John. Going once, going twice. $300-- sold to John. <br/>Why's it always got to be apple pie, my favorite? Can't be something else. <br/>Probst: $300. Now, that is what you bought. That is yours. You can keep that. Before you dig into it, I'll give you an option. You can choose right now to keep that piece of pie for yourself, or you can  give up your piece of pie. You will have no pie, and you can divvy up among four people an entire pie. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, my goodness. <br/>Probst: Do you remain selfish, keep this for yourself, or do you try to buy  some good will? <br/>Well, what's the move? What do you guys want? Is anyone really stoked on pie? <br/>Yes, I'm stoked on pie. <br/>I love pie. <br/>It's your move, man. <br/>It's your choice. It's your move, dude. <br/>It sucks that this was my-- you know, there's always a choice, but I'll eat  the pie. Everyone's nice and I'm confident that no one's going to vote me off because  they didn't get a piece of apple pie. <br/>Probst: Enjoy. <br/>John should have gave the pie to everybody. It just showed how stingy he was. You're playing a game. You're in the game. You don't need to eat. If it was me, I would have gave it to my tribe-- Foa Foa-- and Shambo, so I  think it was a terrible move. It was terrible at that point in the game. <br/>Probst: All right, that's going to be it. going to be it. The Survivorauction is over. The Survivorauction is over. <br/>This morning I got a clue to the hidden immunity idol, so that's something  that can help me advance in this game and potentially, you know, guarantee me  passage at least past the next Tribal Council. I'm hoping, you know, knock on wood, that this is a pretty good clue. "The immunity idol is no rolling stone. At a fork in the road you'll see a structure of rocks. Which are covered with a blanket of green. So search at the base, you may dirty your hands. Remember, it's hidden, so it's Remember, it's hidden, so it's not easily  seen." not easily seen." not easily seen." I'm assuming it's  buried. I'm assuming it's buried. I'm not seeing it right now. I don't know if anyone had been in here. Everything outside is disturbed, so it could be found already. It's making me wonder if Russell has the idol. I mean, he's good at finding idols without clues, but I'm still going to make  moves to advance myself in this game. Better safe than sorry. I'll keep looking. I'll keep looking. [chickens clucking] [chickens clucking]  We're going to have to have you guys for lunch today, and I just wanted to  let you know, okay? [chicken squawks] Well, I'll talk to you in Heaven when I go to Heaven, okay? Bye, chickens. The chickens were probably my single source of happiness the last 29 days. <br/>We can all take a hand in it. <br/>I can't do it. I won't do it. I'll start bawling because I'm really attached to those chickens. We'd have conversations and I'd tell them, "I really need you guys to  lay me some eggs because all these people want to kill you." And they'd  go... [squawks] ...like they understood and they knew exactly what I was  saying. [chickens clucking] I think that I brought them as much peace as they brought  me, much peace as they brought me, and it was a win-win. and it was a win-win. Then... off with their heads. [chickens clucking, Russell mumbling] mumbling] [clucking stops] [clucking  stops]  You got him. <br/>You got him. <br/>That actually wasn't so bad. <br/>Mm-mm. <br/>Tell me when the chickens  Tell me when the chickens stop screaming. stop screaming. What I'm going to do is I'm gonna part the chickens out, and I'm going to  boil them in a little bit of salt water and a lot of fresh water. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Can we rotisserie at least one? So we can get some, like...  No, absolutely not. <br/>Why? <br/>Because you'll lose 65% yield. I'll take care of the cooking because I might not know a lot about a lot of  things, but when it comes to cooking... that's time to say "shut  up" if you're me. <br/>I think most people just want to skewer the chicken and put it over the fire,  but Shambo, being the chef and all that, is going to, like, want to do  something crazy, and so I-- you know, we don't even care so long as we're  eating chicken today. So I think that's the plan unless somebody decides to veto unless somebody  decides to veto it later. it later. <br/>How's that chicken coming? <br/>About another hour and a half. [Dave whistles]  Yeah, um, that's a hard boil. <br/>Yeah, we're not having a conversation about the soup this time, everybody,  'cause I'm in no mood, so just trust me. We'll just call it a bad case of PMS, but I'm really in no mood to talk about  the soup today. <br/>I won those chickens, Shambo, so I think I should be able to say something. <br/>You go right ahead 'cause I'm not listening. <br/>You boil a chicken for two hours, it's going to be ruined. <br/>You have no idea what the [bleep] you're talking about right now and you got  to just respect that on some level. respect that on some level. <br/>Okay, cool. <br/>Okay, cool. <br/>I don't think I have been more angry in the last 29 days, truthfully. He really snapped my head off my body. To have him walk up to me and say, "What's going on with the chicken? Are they done?" I went, "Red code, emergency alert. Shannon has lost her mind." He has absolutely no idea who he's picking a  fight with today. he's picking a fight with today. âª âª âª [chickens clucking] [chickens clucking] It's crazy 'cause I  think God made me really special. In my lifetime, I've had some dreams about situations that I'm pondering, and  sometimes it's dreams that are just out of the blue that occur, and they're,  they're literally clairvoyant dreams. I've probably had, I don't know, 30 of them in my lifetime, and I think  that's God's divine intervention at work. I don't know what makes me think that. I just-- it's-- I really, truly believe that. I think that's what it is, I really do, and I had a dream last night we voted  Dave off. last night we voted Dave off. [chickens clucking] [chickens clucking] Dave is the first to go. <br/>Set in stone, set in stone. <br/>Set in freaking stone. Deal? <br/>Deal. <br/>He's gone. <br/>Shambo had a dream that they voted off Dave. I said, "That's a sign, Shambo. That's a sign. That's like God talking to you." [laughs] So she has her dreams who  she's voting off, and then that's who it has to be. We've got somebody unstable like Shambo. All she votes with is her emotions. You make her mad at somebody, that's it. She'll vote for them. <br/>Oh, my word. <br/>Once Dave's gone, we have the numbers. I'll run it all the way to the I'll run it all the way to the top. top. top. âª âª âª  Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: First things first,  Probst: First things first, Mick, give it up. Mick, give it up. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will each have a rope and a very heavy log. Your job-- hold on to that log for as long as you can. Every three minutes, you'll switch hands and move one knot lower on the rope. This will dramatically increase the amount of weight pulling on your arm. When you can't hold on to the log any longer, the log drops, you're out of  the challenge. Last person standing wins immunity, guaranteed a one in...  Eight. <br/>Probst: ...eight shot at a million dollars. At the auction, Jaison, you spent all of your money on one item, and that  item was a significant advantage in today's challenge. Go ahead and open up the bottle and read the note. <br/>All right, it says, "At any point during today's immunity challenge, you  may move your hand up two knots on the rope..." [Dave whistles] ..."giving  you a significant advantage."  Probst: So what that means-- at any time, you can move up two full knots,  which will significantly reduce the tension and the amount of weight you're  holding. Time it right, it will be a huge advantage. Could be the difference in this challenge. Take your spots. We will get started. All right, everybody grab a hold with your right hand... the first section of  rope. Each time we move down a section of rope, you are going to feel it. These logs weigh as much as you do. This challenge is on. [rope creaking] Every three minutes, you'll switch to the other hand. You will only have one hand on this rope at any given time. All right, everybody place your left hand on the second position on the rope. Get a good grip and release your right hand. Hot day to be sitting out in the Hot day to be sitting out in the sun holding  on to a heavy log. sun holding on to a heavy log. All right, everybody put your left hand on the fourth position on the knot. <br/>Now I'm using both. <br/>Probst: Jaison using his two spots right now. Jaison is now only on the second knot. Everybody else is on the fourth knot. Jaison used that move very early in this challenge. in this challenge. See if it pays off. See if it pays off. All right, everybody, it is time to move further down on the rope. Three, two, one. Release. Now the log's going to begin to get heavy. Shambo trying to hold on. [glass breaking]  Oh! <br/>Probst: Shambo. The log andShambo take a tumble. Shambo, first person out of this challenge. You all right? <br/>I'm good to go. [glass breaking]  Probst: Russell, surprisingly drops out. What happened? <br/>I got a charley horse in my forearm, and that was it. <br/>Probst: All right, everybody, it is time to make the last move. Switch hands. Three, two, one. And release. You have no knot now to give you any kind of leverage or any kind of grip. Now this rope can slip through your hands a lot more easily. Jaison, on the other hand, does have a knot to hold on to, and now will never  feel all of the weight of this log. [rope creaking] [glass breaking] Monica drops her log. <br/>All right, go ahead, boys. [glass breaking]  Probst: John's had enough. <br/>Probst: John's had enough. He steps out of the challenge. He steps out of the challenge. [glass breaking] Brett cannot hold on any longer. Brett is out of the challenge. We are down to four-- Jaison, Dave, Mick and Natalie. I have to say, Natalie, you've got to be the surprise of this challenge right  now. [glass breaking] Mick drops out of the challenge. We are down to three. We have two former Foa Foa, one former Galu. Everybody doing a good job of digging deep. Keep digging. You have more in there. You never know when it's your turn to go. You don't want it to be tonight. [Jaison exhales loudly] [rope creaking] That hand better be bleeding when you  let go. [glass breaking] Natalie cannot hang in there any longer. <br/>Darn. <br/>Probst: Great effort. Natalie out of the challenge. And we are down to two, side by side-- Jaison and Dave for immunity. Jaison has a two-knot advantage. Dave Ball is holding on to rope with no knot. It could easily slip through his hands. [rope creaking]  You got it, Jaison. <br/>Probst: Dave with a bit of a slip. <br/>He's slipping. <br/>Hang on, Jais. <br/>Hang on. <br/>Hang on. [rope creaking] [rope creaking] [glass breaking]  Probst: Dave Ball cannot hold on any longer. Jaison wins individual immunity! <br/>Good job, Dave. [glass breaking]  Yeah. <br/>Good job. <br/>When Dave's hand slipped and the plate broke, it was like heaven. I mean, I'm not sure I would have beaten Dave without that advantage. Shambo wants him gone, and the former Foa Foa are trying to strike while the  iron is hot with Shambo. I just want to focus and execute. We've got to get Dave tonight. <br/>Probst: Jaison, come on over. <br/>Victory! <br/>Good job, Jaison. <br/>Yay, Jaison! <br/>Finally won something. <br/>Finally you won! <br/>Finally wins! <br/>Great job, Jaison! <br/>Probst: Well, you passed up chicken. <br/>It cost me food and money, yeah. <br/>Probst: You passed up cheeseburger, but while everybody else has a full  belly, you have something much more valuable-- safety at tonight's Tribal  Council. Jaison cannot be voted out. As for the rest of you, after 30 days out here, one of you going home tonight. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. <br/>I am definitely in a position of power with Foa Foa at my disposal to vote  how I ask them to. And they keep saying, "Shannon, whatever you want." Dave is so  gone, he doesn't even Dave is so gone, he doesn't even know it. know it. <br/>Man, good job today. <br/>Dave, good work. You almost beat me, and you had no knot. That's incredible. <br/>You beat me fair and square, bro. <br/>Hey, awesome. <br/>Well, I had...  Hey, you, too. Good job. <br/>That was good. <br/>You're on fire, man. <br/>Thanks, man, thanks. <br/>What were you doing up there? Just think... just keep...? <br/>Dave made a few comments to Shambo about the chicken and how to cook it and  stuff, and she was furious, and, you know, when she gets sort of angry at  somebody, that's who she wants voted off, but at this point, we kind of count  on Shambo's votes, kind of count on Shambo's votes, so it's going to be Dave. so it's going to be Dave. <br/>Thank you. I'm bummed I lost, but, oh, well. <br/>It was nice, man. <br/>You and me finally won something, huh? Back to back. <br/>I know, look at that. <br/>I know...  C'est la vie. <br/>C'est la vie. C'est la vie. C'est la vie. C'est la vie. <br/>No way. No way. <br/>No way. No way. <br/>Clearly, Galu is running scared. <br/>Right. <br/>The next vote, I can get them to vote off someone from Foa Foa. <br/>Right. <br/>You already said you were cool with that. <br/>Right. <br/>So I think we just lay low, we hang out, not a lot...  So, right now, just, uh, I guess we're thinking Mick right now. <br/>I mean, I think... I think so, man. <br/>It might be the best option, uh, both ways, yeah. <br/>And then we continue to move on and move on and move on and move on through  this game and progress further and further. <br/>Right. <br/>And if something crazy happens, because you have ears here and I have ears  there...  Yeah, I'll let you know. <br/>If we are... If we do find ourselves outgunned, we can see it coming...  Right. <br/>...we play the idol, and  ...we play the idol, and then we're done. then we're done. <br/>You have it. I'm 100% sure...  Where-Where... Where'd you look? <br/>Uh... well, I...  Tell me where the clue was, and I'll tell you, I'll give you a hint. <br/>What do you mean? <br/>Tell me where the clue was, and I'll tell you where the idol is. At first, we were thinking, get rid of Dave. Everybody's on board to get rid of Dave. It was inthe wall 'cause it didn't roll off. <br/>Yeah. Right, right. <br/>So, it was sitting inside. <br/>Yeah, exactly. <br/>In the meantime, probably the best move would be to get rid of John. He's a threat strategically, and, uh... and I told him that I and, uh... and  I told him that I had the immunity idol. had the immunity idol. And I go, "Good for me..."  Right. <br/>"...if anyone has it, 'cause I thought about the numbers.'  I knew he knew I had it. So he said, "I know you have it." So I didn't want to sit there--  "No, I don't, no, I don't." So I said, "Yeah, I have it, and  it can help us." So now, I have to get rid of John. <br/>As long as you give me your word that you're not voting for me, we're both  here after the vote, we can continue to work...  Right. These poor people need to close their ears when I start talking, 'cause when  I tell you something, and I made a mistake, I got to get rid of you. It was my mistake, but, sorry, John, you've got to go home for it. Sounds good to me, man, as long as, uh, we stick together...  I mean, you're not going to burn me the next vote, I'm not gonna burn you the  next vote. I'm mean, we're rolling. <br/>Yeah, as long as we stick together, then we can do this, the whole way  through. <br/>So we're fine. <br/>So we're fine. <br/>All right, cool. <br/>All right, cool. I can save you tonight. It would be you. <br/>It would be me? <br/>It would definitely. <br/>I had a feeling. <br/>Now, it's going to be Shambo, and the whole Foa Foa tribe. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>That's whose the vote is. <br/>Okay. <br/>I think the best way to do this is get rid of John tonight. And there's no reason I would be lying about this...  Mm. <br/>...because why would I come to you saying, I want to get rid of him when your  name's in the sling right now? <br/>Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. <br/>Is-Is Monica close to John? Can you tell her without her going to John and saying anything? <br/>I could probably say something to her. <br/>All right. <br/>Uh, yeah, yeah, well, you know what, is-- I mean, after he, uh, flipped on  Laura, a matter of frigging time. You know, nobody trusts him anymore. <br/>It will be you if it's not John. I want you to stay in the game. <br/>All right. Because I almost won it today, huh? <br/>That was pretty impressive. <br/>All right. <br/>I don't want them to see me talking to you too much. <br/>All right. All right, brother. <br/>All right, man. <br/>All right, man. <br/>All right. <br/>All right. <br/>If you had a choice to get rid of anybody in this game right now, who would  it be? <br/>John. <br/>He is dangerous. <br/>Most dangerous person here. <br/>With him gone, things would be... we could run it down. <br/>Oh, dude, it'd be cake. <br/>Dave is way too scared right now to not make this deal. Way too scared. We just talked for about 30 minutes. <br/>You did? I don't know, what do you think, man? I think we try John. <br/>I think we get rid of John. <br/>What happens next week with Dave gone? What is Shambo going to do? We don't know. Dude, I don't trust them. I don't trust them at all. All right, so you really believe this. <br/>Dude, it's real... this is gonna happen. <br/>Okay, all right. <br/>For sure. <br/>All right. <br/>All right. <br/>John. <br/>John. <br/>So, basically, Russell and I started talking, and he's, like, "Who would  you get rid of if you could get rid of anybody right now?" Clearly, I  said, John. He's, like, "We can do that, I He's, like, "We can do that, I  think." think."  No. It would be us four...  The next round, I know we can get him. But next round's gonna be a four-four tie, 'cause Shambo's four-four tie,  'cause Shambo's gonna leave us in two seconds. gonna leave us in two seconds. Taking her for granted. You're telling me you really agree with this? <br/>This may be one of our only shots to get rid of John. <br/>Why? <br/>Nothing's for sure, but it just seems like we do have the numbers. <br/>You get rid of John and you piss off Shambo, and she's gonna go to the other  side, and then we're gonna have to draw rocks. <br/>I believe that Russell can settle Shambo. <br/>After leaving her out there hanging the same way Galu did? hanging the same way Galu did? Exactly the same way? Exactly the same way? Exactly the same way? âª âª  Probst: We'll now bring in  Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. the members of our jury. Erik, Kelly and Laura, voted Erik, Kelly and Laura, voted out at the last  Tribal Council. out at the last Tribal Council. Jaison, you bypassed all the food at the auction for one thing, an advantage  in the immunity challenge, and look at you tonight. <br/>Thank God. And some people might say you only won it because you had the advantage, but  that doesn't mean anything to me. As long as I got a victory. <br/>Probst: Dave, do you think that was the difference in the challenge? <br/>Honestly, it looked like it was close, I wanted it real bad, but in the end,  my hand slipped and his didn't, so...  Probst: How concerned are you that kind of physical display could get you  voted out tonight? <br/>It might have put a target on my back, but I just wanted to play my guts out  and do my best. <br/>Probst: Shambo, after 30 days together, is it easier or more difficult to get  along with people out here? <br/>There has been so many ups and downs within the last 30 days, but today was  peaceful. It wasn't about game play so much, and it was genuine. <br/>To me, today was strategic only, completely strategic. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: Shambo, did you say "Wow"? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: That shocks you? <br/>Yeah. I mean...  Probst: Shambo, how is it possible you are shocked to learn that people were  scrambling to stay in the game? <br/>My vote is being based on me advancing in the game, number one. Number two, I do not want somebody that did not warrant getting a million  dollars. That's imperative to me in this game. <br/>Probst: Dave, Shambo was pretty clear. Where do you think you sit in her eyes? <br/>I've done my best to be... as honest and kind as I can with Shambo. You know, just be a good sport about everything. <br/>Probst: John, Shambo wants somebody who deserves to be there. Couldn't that be you? <br/>You know, I don't think that she thinks that I am lacking in effort or a  certain worthiness of continuing on. <br/>Probst: Mick, last three Tribal Councils, all blindsides. You think somebody will be surprised tonight? <br/>You know, at this point, I don't see how you would be surprised. I mean, if you look back here, it looks like we're all getting on planes  tomorrow. <br/>Probst: Meaning everybody brought their stuff. <br/>Everybody brought their stuff. I mean, everyone has to come in here ready to go home tonight. <br/>Russell, you think whoever's going home will be shocked? <br/>I think they'll be surprised. I do. <br/>Probst: Shambo, based on how it's gone the last three times, you think  somebody's gonna be shocked tonight? <br/>I don't think they're gonna be shocked at all. <br/>Probst: So you think they know they're going. <br/>I believe so. <br/>Probst: Dave, think it's gonna be a shocking vote tonight for somebody? <br/>If this vote tonight goes the way I'm expecting it to go, the way I'm  expecting it to go, I will be shocked. I will be shocked. <br/>Probst: John, what's your take on tonight's vote? <br/>I think that of the two potential names, you've asked both of them questions,  and they both said they wouldn't be shocked, so I think the answer is no. <br/>Probst: All right, it's time to get to the vote. Jaison, you earned that immunity. I assume you're keeping it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right, you cannot vote for Jaison. Everybody else is fair game. Let's see if the blindsides continue. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Monica, you're up. Monica, you're up. <br/>Dave, thanks for the chickens. chickens. They were great friends. They were great friends. <br/>John, I'm voting for you because it might get me closer to a million bucks. to a million bucks. Sorry, pal. Sorry, pal. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time play it, now would be the time to do so. to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote... Mick. Dave. One vote Mick, one vote Dave. John. One vote John. John. Two votes John. John. That's three votes John, one vote Mick, one vote Dave. John. That's four votes John, one vote That's four votes John, one vote Mick, one  vote Dave. Mick, one vote Dave. Tenth person voted out and the fourth member of our jury... John. That's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. âª âª John, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Pleasure, boys. <br/>Bye, Johnny. <br/>Bye, Johnny. âª âª  Probst: Well, I got to tell you, based on how you've been playing, I can't  wait to see what's gonna happen next. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. âª âª  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor. <br/>It's like a little kid sees a snake, and the snake's, like, "Hey, come  play with me, I'm not gonna bite you." And the kid starts playing with  the snake, and the snake bites him. He's, like, "What happened? You said you weren't gonna bite me?" He's, like, "I'm a snake. He's, like, "I'm a snake. That's what I do." That's what I do."  I think tonight's vote was another decision made by Galu that is a  substandard decision. They're scrambling, they're doing anything they can to live to see tomorrow. The former Galu tribe is intellectually outmatched. I'm happy that I performed, you know, well and made it into the fourth  quarter. I think I had what it took to go the distance, but it didn't go the distance,  but it didn't work out.
