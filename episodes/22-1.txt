<br/>Jeff: we're on board a helicopter piloted by the  nicaraguan air force, flying over the pacific ocean in central america, where  these americans have already begun the adventure of a lifetime. Each castaway is arriving with nothing but the clothes on their  back and their own unique story. <br/>I'm the c.E.O. Of my own software company. But are there other layers on me? Absolutely. I'm a former federal agent. That's right, special agent sheppard. That was my first and middle name for years. <br/>My faith is everything. My entire life revolves around it. I pray every day as I strive to become more like my savior. <br/>They will call me a redneck, one crazy, student bastard. We ain't ever had a dumb ass win the game, have we? <br/>Jeff: It's the ultimate challenge, a group of strangers  forced to work together while battling the elements and each other. They must learn to adapt or they'll be voted out. In the end, only one will remain to claim the million-dollar  prize. 39 days, 18 people, one survivor. <br/>Jeff: Come on, let's go. Everybody off! <br/>We're on the beach, and we saw the mats and it's like, oh,  wow. This is really happening. I'm really on "Survivor."  All right, guys, let's head in. <br/>I was in the marine corps. Spent two deployments, went to iraq twice. I think I'm going to win just because of my background. I think I've been trained for something like this. <br/>Jeff: welcome to "Survivor." [ cheers and  applause ]  Jeff: Before we get started, we've got two more players  joining us. Right here. <br/>Is that Rob? <br/>Boston Rob! [ cheers ]  Oh, no. <br/>No. <br/>Oh, no! <br/>Oh, my god! It's Russell. I don't even know whose team he's going to be on, but I'm going  to stare down Russell, and I know when I stare down Russell, he'll know, oh,  she's got a little evil inside of her because if I'm not the one person he  picks to keep to the end, then no Matter what, I'm going to be out. I'm gonna be out. <br/>Jeff: I think everybody here is familiar with Boston Rob  and Russell. Boston Rob has proven his ability to help a tribe not only in  challenges, but in camp life. He has played three times. He's made it to the final once. He has never won. Russell, in back-to-back seasons, Russell masterminded two of  the strongest alliances in "Survivor" history. Russell has played twice. He's been to the end twice. He has never won. Together, these two offer 156 days of "Survivor"  experience. That is worth a ton out here. <br/>They're sizing us up like we're prey. <br/>Jeff: what's your name? <br/>Francesca. <br/>Jeff: Francesca, what's your reaction? You said these guys were sizing you up as prey? <br/>Yeah, they're trouble makers. They're two of the most famous trouble makers in  "Survivor" history so I don't think they're here just to help us  out. <br/>Jeff: So the question now is who is going to which tribe? We're going to do it old school, guys. We're going to draw for buffs. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Jeff: They're covered, so we're not giving anything away. Rob, take your pick. Russell, this is for you. All right, let's reveal. [ cheers and applause ]  Yes! <br/>Jeff: Rob. You join ometepe. Take a spot. <br/>All right, baby! <br/>Jeff: Russell hantz, you join zapatera. <br/>Come on, Russell! Let's go, buddy. <br/>We welcome you. <br/>Jeff: Take a spot. [ applause ]  Join in! Join in! <br/>Jeff: All right, there is one more twist. When you are voted out at tribal council, you will not go home. <br/>What! <br/>Jeff: Instead, you will leave tribal council, and you will  be sent to redemption island. Where you will live alone. You will have the same basic supplies that your tribemates had  back at camp, but it will be up to you to keep the shelter going. It will be up to you to tend the fire. It will be up to you to feed yourself. It will not be easy. When the next person joins you on redemption island, the two of  you will square off in a duel. <br/>What? <br/>Jeff: The winner stays. The loser is out of the game for good. At a certain point in the game, the remaining person on  redemption island will be allowed to re-enter the game and continue their  pursuit of the title of sole survivor, and the million-dollar prize. <br/>Sweet! <br/>Redemption island does not scare me one bit. It's a vacation. Yeah. Put me on that island, see what happens. Because I'm going to win the challenge and I'm going to come  back and I'm going to take some heads off. <br/>Jeff: You guys ready to get started with this game? <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: Ometepe, a map to your camp. Zapatera, a map to your camp. It is going to rain a lot out here in nicaragua. I suggest you get to camp quickly, start using the experience of  Rob and Russell, start building camp. Ometepe, you're heading out that way. Zapatera, that way. <br/>When Jeff told us what redemption island is, I was like, I  didn't even know how to process it. I mean, it makes Rob and Russell being here a lot more  complicated because they could definitely come back into the game even if we  get rid of them. The good part of it is that if I get voted out, I could come  back into the game. But the possibility of getting voted out was so not a reality to  me that I only saw it as a downside. I'm like, damn it! Someone I vote out is going to come back to haunt me. Crap. <br/>As soon as I walked to the camp, I was so greatful to be  back to get my title of sole survivor. <br/>The power of purple. <br/>The first two, I was a school boy. This one, I'm bringing it. <br/>Steve. <br/>This is going to be the new me. I'm going to be the leader to my tribe. When I sit them all down and I take control of the camp, I'll  become the leader of the camp. <br/>Attention. Everybody, attention. <br/>I got a little something to say. You know, you see it on tv, it seems easy. I promise you, you're about to experience the toughest thing  that you've ever been through in your entire life. I'm not here to sabotage anything from nobody. If I came back and did something like that, it would be pretty  stupid of me. I'm here to win. <br/>Right on. <br/>Let's do it! <br/>Good job zapatera. One, two, three. Zapatera! <br/>I think anybody who doesn't think Russell is dangerous is  foolish. He's played the game twice and ended up in the finals twice. He hasn't won and there's no mystery why he hasn't won. It's the way he's chosen to play the game both times. He's too aggressive and he wants the blood on his hands. <br/>All right, boys, let's take it away. <br/>All right! <br/>Okay. <br/>When I seen a big box of nails and all that, I love it. <br/>How about that. We've got it all. <br/>Can't wait to get started. I've camped. I've built cabins. I've done all this kind of stuff. We can put it right here. Right here's another fork. We done got our slope. They listen to me, I believe we can build a decent shack. Some of them I don't think knows what's going on but I don't  want them to know that. <br/>Superhero nickname, steel wool. You can get through anything with a little bit of elbow grease. And you have the most impressive man sweater I have ever seen. First impression, very good impression. I think we have a bunch of worker bees which is good. As long as we can win and stay away from the immunity  challenges, I think we're going to do damn well. <br/>There you go. <br/>Get up there. <br/>All right! Put it in there. Okay. <br/>Okay, Ralph, tell us what you need. <br/>All right. <br/>All right. <br/>Can you grab a nail. <br/>Heal, yeah. <br/>Ready to watch the first injury. <br/>Help him. Help him. <br/>There you go. There you go. <br/>Well done. <br/>Did it hit right in the middle? <br/>I think so. <br/>Okay, that's good. <br/>This is a stupid question-- you are from boston, aren't  you? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Things are going really well right now. It's just such a blessing to have Rob here. With his history in construction and his having been here and  his laid back approach is really bringing a lot of harmony to this tribe. We might as well call it camp harmony right now. <br/>Just stop us and tell us--  You're the pro here. <br/>You guys know what you're doing. <br/>I am so glad that we have Boston Rob. He's amazing. I'm just having so much fun with him. And I feel like a sense of comfort and I think if Russell was  here, we would all be on edge, you know, because he's nuts. You know, he would have-- oh, he would have been crazy. <br/>Hey, guys. Listen. Because of the size of these beams, we're going to have the  opening be that way, we were saying, because that's the water run-down, and  we get this whole bank here protecting us from the wind. Why don't you let me do that? <br/>I don't mind digging. <br/>No, no, it's not about that. It's the way you're doing it. If you're going to do it, put the weight like that. <br/>All right, knock yourself out. I mean, pRobably the most annoying person so far is Phillip. <br/>Do you want to help dig? <br/>Yeah, do you need help? <br/>Sure, there are going to be two more holes over there. I'll just finish up here. <br/>I mean, he's just got that aggressive kind of like, in  your face personality, which, you know, you just need to be careful out here  because that's the kind of thing that can just turn people off. <br/>When you hammer, if you strike this way-- like, if you  miss this it can go like that and hit you. If you're going to hammer this way, put this foot out. I'm with you. <br/>Apparently, my hatcheting isn't the correct technique, but  I mean, I don't even have the best aim, so I'm just going at it. I grew up on a farm so I know how to use an axe and I know how  to hammer. I think he just likes playing the father role a little bit, so  just let him do that. <br/>I think he likes that. <br/>I know! <br/>You're excited there. <br/>I was just thinking, it's a good place to be. I want all of you to come over. I'm going to tell you something about myself. You know, I had to debate whether or not I was going to tell  you, whether or not I was going to reveal it. I'm a former federal agent. I did it for three separate agencies so when I give you my word,  if I say something, it's going to be my word. The other thing is I'm an expert in analyzing people's behavior. So I can determine most of the time whether or not someone is  telling me the truth or not and that's what I'm going to be able to do when  we finally merge and we get to the other side. And I'll tell you, if that's a friend or not. Okay? And all I want to say is I've got seven sisters and I love  women, okay. [ laughter ]  You made the right move. <br/>One of the best things about Phillip is the comic relief  that's provided by the fact that he thinks he used to be a federal agent is,  like, this big secret, like, bombshell that he has, that he's holding. You know, it will just blow everyone's mind if they knew. It's hilarious. Who cares? <br/>We have a whole basket full of stuff, and no one is  looking for the hidden immunity idol, the clue to it which is kind of weird  because don't you think maybe it's somewhere in the stuff. <br/>What is your first name? <br/>Kristina. <br/>Kristina. I have gone thinking maybe you could go through this stuff here  and check it out and see if there's anything useful in in there? <br/>I already did. It's just pieces of cloth, and there are scissors and yarn, and  a sewing box. <br/>Maybe Matt, if Matt wants -- I know you know what's up. So go through it. <br/>I went through it. <br/>Nothing? <br/>I've gone through everything except this. I can't open it. <br/>Okay, I'll try to keep them away. See what you can find. <br/>Everything is really new. Everyone is trying to get their footing. The fact that Rob noticed I was looking for the clue it worries  me a little bit because I don't want to come off as this really aggressive  strategizer and turn people off. Hopefully he's the only person that understood what was going  on, but it drives me crazy. I want it. <br/>Dude, our tribe, man, we're the bomb. <br/>Okay. <br/>Five girls and four guys. <br/>That's true. <br/>You know, what I'm saying. So just--  I'm really good with girls. <br/>So am I--  We'll work that out. <br/>We've got to keep our eyes open. <br/>I definitely want to be working together. <br/>Me, too. <br/>I'm serious about that. <br/>We'll talk about it later. But someone with a good work ethic and on the same page as  me  You got that right. I heard somebody say to me, when you look at this game a lot of  people get really super paranoid. The thing about me and any sheppard, no. I mean, Rob is sizing me up. So I like to think of it like two male lions. [ growls ] they're checking each other out. They're doing that whole thing and they're doing a little dance  but there will come a point-- okay, where that's going to take over. I thought this would be a good time for us to talk a little bit. <br/>All right. <br/>I'm going to need your help keeping those young girls from  not having too much. Look at me. Rob already said to me you gotta watch those girls. There are more girls here. <br/>There are. He'd be an idiot not to. <br/>He's going to try to divide and conquer. He's going to try to play me like a fool. And I'm going to play along. And I'm going to stick to the girls. <br/>I like you, and definitely there's something about you  that's really solid. But--  I've got a little integrity. <br/>I do, too. <br/>In terms of what I tell people. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>And I think you and I can work together. And--  Yeah, you know what? I'm totally on board. <br/>Okay, cool. Let's go find some logs, all right? <br/>Well, what do you think about this tribe? <br/>I don't know if we're on the winning side, to tell you,  from the looks of it. The other team, I'm telling you, they look more physical. Russell and I were looking for the tree mail, and he came up to  me and I got all nervous because I felt like, oh, prom date. <br/>Who did I bring the first time? What was her name. <br/>Natalie. <br/>Who did I bring the second time? <br/>Parve tee. <br/>But your speech, Russell, about how you changed. It was just-- it was so moving to me. It was. I believed you. <br/>Listen--  I believed you. You are a changed man. <br/>You have to get on the right team. I think we can do something together. But this is dangerous because I'm not going to be walking around  with you that much because you-- you-- you are that girl. <br/>I think it's better that you don't. <br/>Me and you, when we get to the merge, it will be over. <br/>Done. <br/>That's all we gotta do is get to the merge. <br/>Russell is so sneaky. He was like, "Let's form an alliance." which is great  because he made it to the top three every time he played. So, of course I said yes. <br/>He's getting the girls. <br/>Please, god, don't let that happen. <br/>We don't want that to happen. We need to get Russell out of this game immediately. <br/>Russell is not a threat--  I disagree completely. He's got his hooks in one of them. <br/>Who does he have his hooks in? <br/>Stephanie. <br/>What does he do every time? He takes a cute little girl--  Cute little girl-- and takes her and turns her into the  villainess. <br/>That's right. <br/>I won't let that happen. <br/>I don't think we can let it happen. I like David. David seems like a nice guy. He told me Russell had his hooks in Stephanie. Any pros of having Russell around have quickly evaporated. He's just going to spread paranoia and be a cancer to the tribe. At this point, there's nothing to be done yet except for the  task at hand which is get Russell gone as soon as possible. <br/>We were in a time warp. <br/>I don't want to have Rob stick around that long. I mean, I like the guy. He's a great guy, but he's dangerous to have on the tribe. <br/>It looks like greased lightning. <br/>I'm working on... [ laughter ] dreads. <br/>The guys are in awe of Rob, and, you know, he's going  after all the young girls because they're easy pickings. So whatever I do, I think he's pRobably who I'm going to try and  focus on really quickly. If there's an idol out there, if I at all can do anything to  find one, then I will do it. If anyone can do it on this tribe, it's me. <br/>My immunity idol antenna have been on alert since I hit  the beach. Like, I wanted to find it. I knew it was here. Even if it stood out in our camp, I wanted to look around and  poke around. I knew that in order for us to find it, we had to find  landmarks. Our landmarks were going to be our map. <br/>Sweet. This is awesome. Oh, my goodness. Ho-ho-ho. Rob's good. Rob's good. I'm good, too. It's going to be fun. This is going to be fun. The hidden immunity idols, I mean, it means power. I'm pRobably going to tell somebody about it, but I haven't  decided who yet. But I can make this big giant splash of a move and, like, get  rid of Rob tonight if I wanted to. I really could. The faster he goes, the better. <br/>He's number one on the chopping block, in my mind. <br/>Are you on board? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Don't say a word. <br/>I'm not going to tell you how to play the game. Like right now you decided to do what you wanted to do and I  appreciate that. And I'm not going to tell you how to play your game. If I feel the need to tell somebody something, I'll do it. I'm a very processed person so if you came to me and said,  "Look, we want to form this alliance and we want you to be a part of it  and we want you to vote out Rob." I'm going to hear it for what it is  and then I'm going to step back and I'm going to go through how you got  there. It's called corRoboration. Tell me who the other votes are? <br/>Phillip, relax. <br/>Just answer my question. <br/>I'm sorry we said anything. <br/>Right now you don't have vote, per three of us. <br/>You don't know anything. <br/>You need to inform me. <br/>The fact that you're getting this at attitude with us. You don't need to be having that attitude with us. <br/>That attitude is not--  You know what? You need to pipe that. You need to pipe that thing about an attitude. I'm a grown man. I'm 52 years old. I've been around. I've been an agent like I told you before and what I learned  throughout my career is you ask questions. <br/>I don't have any information to give you. <br/>I don't need two people talking at once. <br/>Okay, I'm sorry. You go, christina, I'll wait. I'm not allowed to talk while you're talking. <br/>Right now, there are three people. I'm not going to go up and just for the hell of it say,  "Rob," and the rest of them go, "Phillip." they've still  got the votes to get me out. <br/>You know what? Here they come. We had an agreement to wait and talk about this until we lost. We're your friend here. <br/>We're done. We're done with this conversation for now. All right? <br/>I don't know how it happened. How did I get stuck with the old annoying guy in the droopy  fuchsia briefs? He's such a pain in my ass. Did I mention that we're in an alliance together? How awesome. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to your first immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: here's how it works. On my go, each tribe will push four blocks along the track to  build the base of a temple. You'll then run up the steps, where one person will use an axe  to chop a series of ropes, releasing another set of steps. You'll then make your way to the top, where you will race to  complete a block puzzle, completing your temple. First tribe to get it right wins immunity, is safe from the  vote. Losers go to tribal council, where somebody will be the first  person voted out and the first person sent to redemption island. This is what you want right here. This little statue guarantees your safety in this game. When you're in possession of immunity, you can't be voted out. Without it, you are vulnerable. In addition, the winning tribe wins fire in the form of flint. All right, give a minute to strategize, and we'll get started. All right, here we go! For immunity and fire. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Jeff: You've got four blocks. You've got to get them to this wall one at a time. They are very heavy. Zapatera with a bit of a lead right out of the gate. <br/>Keep going. <br/>Jeff: Gotta hit the wall. Go! Ometepe, you're good. Let's go, guys. Come on! <br/>Push on that side. <br/>Push! <br/>Jeff: Everybody's got to work together. <br/>Go! <br/>Jeff: A very deceiving challenge. It looks like these would just glide over these tracks but they  don't. Ometepe slowing down. Zapatera still with a bit of a lead. You're good! Ometepe dig in! Let's go! <br/>Push it, baby, push it. <br/>Jeff: You're good! Zapatera doing a very good job. One, two, three. <br/>Jeff: Strength really making a difference for zapatera. <br/>Got it! Push! Push! <br/>Jeff: zapatera has their third block! <br/>Come on, guys, we got this. <br/>Jeff: Ometepe really slowing down. <br/>Go! <br/>Jeff: keep digging! <br/>Push! <br/>Go! <br/>Jeff: let's go, ometepe. <br/>Come on, guys. Push! Let's catch them. Come on, keep going. Go, go, go! <br/>Drive! Go. <br/>Push! <br/>Jeff: zapatera, you're good. Go. Ometepe has their last block. They have fallen behind. <br/>Let's go, let's go. <br/>Come on, go, go, go. <br/>Jeff: Ralph working on the rope now. <br/>Come on, Ralph! <br/>Jeff: Ometepe completely out of it right now. <br/>Come on! <br/>Jeff: Ralph not wasting any time. Zapatera with a big lead. <br/>Come on, come on. <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Keep it going. Keep going. Come on now, don't quit. <br/>Jeff: You want to see the pattern on the outside of this  purple. You want the solid colors to be on the inside. <br/>The bottom corner. <br/>Jeff: Ometepe still pushing their last block. You're good. Let's go, ometepe. <br/>Come on, Matt, come on! <br/>Jeff: Matt working on the ropes for ometepe. <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Jeff: You better pick it up, brother! <br/>There you go, Matt. <br/>Keep going. <br/>Perfect! <br/>Jeff: zapatera working on their puzzle with a big head  start. <br/>Okay, we got this, come on. <br/>Jeff: Matt working his way through those ropes. He's got one left. There it is! Let's go! You're still in this! <br/>Come on, baby! <br/>Jeff: Ometepe has a great puzzle maker in Rob. Is Rob strong enough to bring his tribe back? <br/>Tell us what to do. <br/>Jeff: David barking the orders for zapatera. <br/>This one goes right here. <br/>Jeff: Rob is leading ometepe, as expected. <br/>Help me get this out. <br/>Jeff: Ometepe is not panicking. They're working together. <br/>Perfect. <br/>Hey! <br/>Jeff: zapatera had a gigantic lead. And it is gone. <br/>Guys, guys, we got this. <br/>Stay in it. <br/>I'm listening to him. <br/>Jeff: Russell is now calling the shots. It is Russell and Boston Rob. This is where patience and experience comes into play. <br/>Come get this piece. <br/>Jeff: Nobody wants to go to tribal council tonight. Nobody wants to go to redemption island. This could be a very close finish. <br/>Come on, come on! <br/>Jeff: Russell slides in another piece. Are they right? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: zapatera wins immunity. <br/>Yes, baby! Yes! Yes! <br/>One, two, three! Zapatera! <br/>Jeff: Congratulations, zapatera. First immunity win. Nobody going home from zapatera. In addition, fire will get a whole lot easier. Zapatera, grab your stuff. Head back to camp. All right, ometepe, tribal council tonight. Somebody from your tribe will be the first person voted out of  this game, the first person sent to redemption island. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I will see you at tribal. <br/>We are stronger than they are. We're faster than they are. We're smarter than they are. I know how Boston Rob thinks. Right now, he's thinking oh, crap. I'm stuck with a bunch of weenies. <br/>Yeah, so we lost the first challenge today, which totally  sucks, and in a way, like, I don't know if other people feel this way, but I  feel like we let Rob down. It's weird, but you want to please your leader, I guess. But it sucks we have to go to tribal council tonight. <br/>I just want to tell you. <br/>Okay. <br/>I have a hidden immunity idol. <br/>How is that possible? <br/>I found it. <br/>Where? <br/>I just found it. <br/>When did you get a clue? <br/>I didn't get a clue. I found it without a clue. But, listen, what I think we should do, after carefully thinking  about everything, I don't know if we can trust the girls. I think we should get all the men to vote for me. You, me, and big mouth over there all vote for Rob. And they try and vote me out, and I'll play the idol, and boom,  like this whole game turns. <br/>Yeah, wow. You have the idol? <br/>Yeah. Okay? So I don't want to talk to you too long. But I think this is our only option. <br/>I was totally shocked that Kristina had the idol, but I'm  amazed and it's totally made my day. So she's really-- she was really excited about using it to  blindside Rob tonight. And as much as it is, like, a fun and that would be amazing and  feel really awesome in the moment, he is a strong competitor, and we still  need him. It's your immunity idol so, you know, whatever you want to do. But I think that Natalie is the weakest one. I think that if we do Rob tonight, everyone is going to be  pissed off. We don't have numbers. It's still just you me-- you, me, and Phillip. That doesn't get us anywhere. I'm going to do what you want to do. I just want you to think about it. I don't want us to commit to it right now just because-- just  really, really think about it. <br/>All right, tentatively we'll do Natalie. Let me ponder it for a few minutes. <br/>Think about it. We have time. Just know you're not going home tonight. <br/>I know I'm not going home tonight. That I've known for a while. Voting Natalie is better for the tribe. Voting Rob is better for me. There are so many different ways to go. I would love to vote Rob off tonight. I would love to. I would just love to. Just like-- neah! You know. Hey, who are you guys thinking of voting for tonight? <br/>I don't know. <br/>I'm open to discussion. <br/>We'll talk about it. <br/>All right. <br/>Originally, I wanted to vote Francesca off because the  very first time I met her, she stood up on the mat, looked at Jeff, and said,  "I don't want to play with him because he's too sneaky." she knows  my game so I don't want someone like that on my tribe. But after thinking about it some more, the second we landed on  our beach, Kristina was the one looking through all the supplies, looking for  the hidden immunity idol. She's dangerous. She knows strategy. She knows to get out there and work for it. To me, I don't need someone like that with me. <br/>I'll tell you this-- the second we landed on the beach,  christina, the first thing she did, she was looking through the sewing kit. <br/>I know, that's what I thought. <br/>I wouldn't put it past her to have it? <br/>To have it? <br/>I think they have it. <br/>I think they have it, and even if they don't, there's no  reason why we shouldn't split the vote and be safe, you know what I mean? The guys are voting for francine-- yeah, Francesca. We're voting for fran. You guys are voting for christine. <br/>Does everybody understand that? I got so screwed last season because one person didn't  understand. <br/>Go through it again. <br/>Don't let anybody try to, like -- bamboozle you. <br/>Yeah, that's it. This is us. That's it. <br/>We're good. <br/>When you're in this-- what I call the hyper state of  arousal, when you're in a survivor environment, you're losing weight, you're  thirsty, you're suffering from dehydration, things can sometimes flare up,  and what have you. But I realize I still haven't gotten the answer that I  originally said to you, as well as to Francesca, which is I'm with you, if I  know who that other votes are--  All right, phil, come on. Come here. <br/>I've got something to show you. <br/>No, no. <br/>Come on, come on. <br/>All right, show me. <br/>Okay. <br/>You don't need the votes. We've got them right here. You know what this means? This is the hidden immunity idol. What it means is that yours, mine, and Francesca's votes will  decide who goes home. Do you understand? I'm extremely nervous telling Phillip about the idol. He came up to me and said, "I've done my analytical thing,  and we don't have the votes--" I didn't want him to switch or do  something weird. I don't know, I don't trust the guy, and that's why I hated  telling him. I just felt I had to tell him. I didn't have a choice there. He had to get some reassurance, that he has some power here in  this game. With your brain and, like, the way you think, and, I mean, just  you helping me and-- we could go all the way if we wanted to. You know, like, you have my support. <br/>Okay, cool. Another hug. <br/>Hopefully he'll just keep a lid on it. That was a risk. He can't handle the information. He can't keep it on the downlow. He's a spaz about it. He's a spaz about everything, if you really want to know the  truth. Oh, god. <br/>In the tribe's best interest, it may not necessarily be  the best interest to get rid of Rob. But is it in the interest of Phillip sheppard and company who  came to play a game and make some bold moves? And I think the longer Rob is around and solidifying those girls  and that whole thing, I'm weakened, and so I need to get rid of him now. Good-bye, Rob. And you're looking at the new leader. Of our tribe. <br/>Jeff: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch and approach the flame. Dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual of tribal council, because in this  game, five represents your life. When your fire's gone, so are you, with a slight exception this  season, redemption island, which we will talk about. All right, Rob, what happens when you first get to camp? <br/>Right to work. Right away. Phillip set the tone. Everybody's pitching in. And we've got a pretty damn good shelter built the first night. <br/>Jeff: So, Phillip, did you just naturally assume the  leadership role? <br/>Not necessarily the leadership role, but if I see work  that needs to be done, I'll suggest it. <br/>Jeff: So, Matt, is Phillip the leader for now around camp? <br/>I mean, if you're doing something that is  counter-productive, he'll call you out on it. And it's not well received on the very first day. <br/>Jeff: Francesca, let's talk about the different reasons  you might vote someone out tonight. <br/>We need to keep the tribe as physically strong as  possible. And so, that implies that a woman is going to go, but, I mean,  we're going to have to wait and see what happens. <br/>Jeff: Kristina, how are you feeling tonight going into the  vote? <br/>I don't feel safe at all. I have my stuff right here because there's a very good  possibility I'm going to go home. <br/>Jeff: Rob, a lot of talk about the guys having a free  pass. I would put an asterisk next to your name. <br/>Of course. It could be me walking away, and there's nothing I can do about  it, but that's the game. <br/>Jeff: Francesca, let's talk about redemption island. Now when you vote somebody out, they could come back to either  help or haunt you. <br/>Oh, yeah. It's definitely adding a level of complexity and it completely  changes the game. If Boston Rob got voted out tonight-- which he's not going to--  but if he did, he would pRobably be fine. We could all feel there's a good chance he's going to come back  into the game. <br/>I have an issue with that statement she just made because Francesca  and Kristina asked me to cast my vote for Rob. <br/>That is not true. <br/>Excuse me. <br/>I asked you to--  Excuse me, I didn't interrupt you while you spoke. I want to finish what I was saying. <br/>Kristina, did I ask him to vote for Rob? <br/>Absolutely not. <br/>Excuse me! Excuse me. <br/>You are a crazy person. <br/>Excuse me. <br/>I'm going to interrupt you, Phillip. I don't respect you. I'm going to say what I want to say when I want to say it. <br/>Jeff, I'm a former special agent so if I make a statement  to you I'll make sure to adhere to that and I will not betray. I'll go down on a sinking ship before I do that until I hear  something different and I just heard something different so my vote tonight  will be for fransesqua. <br/>Francesca. <br/>Francesca. <br/>I don't want Phillip to jump down my throat now, but Phillip  just kind of had a major freakout out of nowhere and it puts into people's  minds that maybe there's a little bit of instability there. <br/>Excuse me, you and fransques-- fran--  "Cesca."  Francesca approached me to go along with them because she  has an immunity idol. And that's why they approach me with it. They took me to it and they showed it to me. <br/>Jeff: So, Kristina, you do have an idol? <br/>I do have an idol. <br/>Jeff: who is that news to? <br/>I didn't know. <br/>We didn't know. <br/>So that was the plan, you two were going to get together  and vote me off. <br/>No. <br/>Yes, Rob. <br/>I haven't heard you defend yourself. <br/>I had no intention of voting you out, and Kristina, can  you attest to that. <br/>That's absolutely true. <br/>Phillip. <br/>I told him that I was going to vote for you, but I was  actually going to vote for Natalie. <br/>Excuse me, Rob. You just heard what she said. I had no knowledge what she was really going to do. And now you're trying to say I'm unstable. No, I'm quite rational. And guess what, I was going to vote for fransquesca--  Francesca. <br/>My mouth is dry and I've been getting treatment for it. I'm done, Jeff, I have nothing further to add. <br/>Jeff: Nothing? <br/>I'm done with it. <br/>Jeff: Rob, you have to be sitting there thinking who do I  believe? <br/>Phillip is pretty adamant about his story. Francesca has adamantly denied it. Kristina really hasn't defended herself at all-- you haven't. <br/>It was something that we considered. We would be idiots not to. But it's not something that we were going to do tonight. <br/>You have the immunity idol? Let me see it. This is the immunity idol? <br/>Yes. <br/>And you're saying that he's lying. <br/>Yes. <br/>Okay, give me the immunity idol and you'll stay. Give me the immunity idol, and you'll stay. Why should I trust you any more than you should trust me. <br/>I can't do that. <br/>I'm just staying by you not giving it to me it makes me  think that you're not telling the truth. <br/>That's ridiculous. <br/>It's yours. Obviously, somebody's lying. So you have an idol and it may save you for three more days. But... I'm going to do what I said I was going to do with the  people that I said I was going to do it with. And that's it. <br/>Jeff: This has been one of the most amazing tribal  councils. I have absolutely no idea what is about to go down. Let's get to the vote. Andrea, you're up. <br/>Man, it feels so good to play with you amateurs. You give away so much. You don't even know enough to keep your mouth shut. Thanks for the memories. <br/>You might make it through this tribal council, but pRobably  not the next one. <br/>I had planned on voting for you or Boston Rob tonight, but  your crazy outburst has spared Natalie. I hope to never see you again. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol, and you want to play  it, now would be the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Kristina. Kristina. That's two votes Kristina. Francesca. One vote Francesca. Phillip. One vote Phillip. Francesca. Two votes Francesca. We're tied. Two votes Phillip, two votes Kristina, two votes Francesca. Kristina. That's three votes Kristina. Tied again. Three votes Francesca, three votes Kristina, two votes Phillip. One vote left. First person voted out of "Survivor: redemption  island," Francesca. You need to bring me your torch. Francesca, the tribe has spoken. You will have a chance to re-enter this game. Take your torch. Head to redemption island. <br/>Good-bye, you guys. Don't trust Phillip. <br/>Jeff: well, good news, flint will be waiting for you back  at camp. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor": Russell meets his  match. <br/>I don't like how you are coming at me. I know how to play this game. <br/>This old boy out here does, too. <br/>Jeff: And Phillip meets his. While at redemption island, every week is a fight to stay alive. This is it, do or die time. This is the first step in your journey to get even. To get a second chance in this game. <br/>Wow. I don't know what to say. I guess I should have trusted my instincts from the beginning,  which was, you know, that Phillip wasn't someone to be trusted. I have no idea what's going to happen. I don't know when the next person comes to redemption island. I have no idea what the duel is going to entail.
