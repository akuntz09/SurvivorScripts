<br/>Probst: Previously on Survivor... The alliance of John, Tammy, the General and Zoe maintained strategic control of the camp. <br/>They've all decided to vote the same. <br/>When I give you my word, my word is huge. It's the most important thing to me. <br/>Neleh and Paschal, I think, are really supporting my success in this game. <br/>Three strikes and you're out! <br/>Probst: But the alliance's blatant display of power at the immunity challenge caused Paschal and Neleh to rise up against them. <br/>They just didn't play it smart in that game. I'm not going to go out fifth or sixth. We've worked too hard. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, they joined V., Sean and Kathy, and voted John, the leader of the alliance, off the island. John, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Okeydoke. <br/>Probst: Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Very nice. <br/>Oh, God, it's so good! It's a new day. I think I can win. I found myself before, kind of having my destiny in other people's hands, and now it's a new spirit. It's a new day we're starting here! Hello, world! <br/>Hello, world! <br/>You're going to be the first jet beauty of the week. <br/>Now that myself, Kathy, V., Pappy and Neleh got together, we said you know what, truly may the best man win, with no alliance. <br/>Marquesan islands! <br/>It is beautiful! <br/>We want the people who play this game fairly, and don't try and manipulate people, to have a good chance to get to the top. <br/>This is funny, I mean, to see that we had turned around like that at the last second, and beat them at their own game, I just think it's hilarious, like I just laugh my head off. <br/>Oh, yeah. The taro that did it. <br/>Okay, all the lamps are fixed and full. <br/>All right! <br/>The mood is very, very happy among those five people. I mean, they're all very... they're happy. You know, they're sitting pretty, they've got five of them. <br/>We're going to have to go to bed at night. <br/>It's so important that we just maintain this. Maintain this. <br/>I got to tell you one thing, though, we need to have some fun today. <br/>I know, for real. <br/>I want to find some more cowry shells. So when you guys are going, I'm going to be in search of cowry shells. <br/>Okay. <br/>We're two outcasts. <br/>I feel like an outcast sitting over here. <br/>You can't make them come over and hang out with us. <br/>They see us as traitors. Even though they've all done the same. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>I want to be so truthful. I just want to be truthful. <br/>We have been from day one. That's why I said, you know what, when it comes down to it, I want to be with people that are going to be honest with me. <br/>Basically, we got screwed because of John. It's our fault for trusting him. I think that myself, Rob and Zoe all have targets on our back, because of the alliance, and unless something changes in the next few days, because I'm seen as the "leader" after John, I'm the next to go. <br/>You, then me, kid. That's the pecking order. <br/>Yeah. That's all right. Thanks. We'll see. The game's not over yet. My allegiance is to Zoe and Rob at this point. Zoe fits right into that group now, huh? I really don't know what game Zoe is playing. I wanted to see how strong our alliance was. I just told Zoe, I said, you know, I'm glad that, you know, we were on a team for a while. Well, it was a pretty loose friendship on my line. The alliance was... I mean, whatever game you want to play now is fine, but that's not what you were saying earlier. Zoe tried to say that she wasn't in alliance with John, Rob and myself. And you know what? That's just not true. If you want me to keep my mouth shut now, so you can play your game, that's one thing. Be straight with me. I'd respect that much more than ... me right now. <br/>You want me to tell you from the get-go, I didn't like you. I didn't really dig you. I didn't like dig the way your eyes were, your presentation. <br/>I have changed my opinion of Zoe. Zoe is a bitch. I mean, she's just trying to save her own butt right now. Maybe her true colors will start to, you know, shine through and somebody will figure out who she is and want to vote her off instead of me. <br/>As far as the game goes now, I don't trust you. <br/>I don't trust you either. <br/>Cool. Then let's go gather some shells, because that's what I came here for. I didn't come here for a bunch of .... I came here to get some shells. I'm distancing myself from Tammy at this point. I'm here to win. I'm here to be the final Survivor, and if I had to say something to someone and do something exactly the opposite without them knowing or them finding out later, well, that's just the way it is. That's the way life is. <br/>Uh-oh. A big coconut. We got mail! You guys are going to be so in love. Okay, you guys ready? "Hard as a rock, sweet as can be, tough to get into as you soon will see. You're going to pair up, but you won't know with whom, full bellies and a party if you both can pull through." [cheering] This is going to be good. <br/>Probst: Okay. For today's reward challenge, you will compete as teams, four teams of two. You guys have already randomly drawn lots to determine who's paired with who. Sean and Paschal, Tammy and Vecepia, Kathy and the General, Neleh and Zoe. Your goal today, fill your three-foot tall bamboo shoot to the top with coconut juice. You can gather the coconuts in two ways, you can swim far out and get the large parcels of coconuts that are anchored in the water, or you can stay here on shore and pick up the coconuts that are scattered along the beach. First team to fill their chute wins. Now for the reward. The winning team will be picked up at your beach by helicopter. You'll be dropped off atop a mountain where two horses will be waiting for you. You will take a really fun ride down to an authentic full-on Marquesan feast. You'll come back fully sated and ready for your last 13 days. Make sense? Take your spots, wait for my go. Remember, you can get individual coconuts on the beach or those tethered out in the water. Survivors ready! Go! <br/>That a way Sean. Go! <br/>That a way Sean. Go! <br/>That a way Sean. Go! <br/>That a way Sean. Go! <br/>That a way Sean. Go! <br/>That a way Sean. Sean and Paschal with a really healthy coconut! You guys need to pick it up. You guys are dry, what's up? Keep working hard, guys. Kathy and General, you guys need to pick it up. <br/>Come on, let's get going. Let's do it, man. <br/>Okay. This is a healthy one, too. <br/>Okay, let's do that one. You might want to try to chop that other one. <br/>Probst: You're in this game, guys, keep it up. <br/>You got it, Zoe. Look at that, you're in the game with one coconut. <br/>Oh, Zoe, we are on top of it. <br/>Probst: Keep fighting, guys. Sean got a system. Sean and Paschal have a bit of a lead over Neleh and Zoe. <br/>Pap, go get us some more coconuts. I got this. <br/>Check them every once in a while. <br/>Probst: Tammy and V, falling behind. You guys got a whole lot of coconuts and no juice. Kathy and the General right back in it. <br/>This is it, we got the system. We're doing well. <br/>Probst: Zoe and Neleh, gaining fast. Now you're going, Sean. That a way, Vecepia. One coconut can get you right back in it. <br/>Keep going. <br/>Probst: We got a game right now. Sean and Paschal getting closer. Guys, don't let up. <br/>Get me some more, Pap. <br/>More? <br/>Come on, I don't care if it's hard, we've got to keep going! <br/>Probst: Sean and Paschal very close. <br/>Pappy! We're not out of this yet, baby. <br/>Probst: We're in a dead heat right now. <br/>We're going to win it. This is your win. <br/>Probst: This could be it. Sean and Paschal! Nice work. Sean and Paschal! Nice work. Well earned. Is this the most unlikely pair? <br/>Huh? The old man and the brother. <br/>The old man and the brother. <br/>Probst: Pulled it out. <br/>By the grace of God, man. <br/>Probst: I guarantee you tomorrow is going to be a great day for you guys. You guys can head back to camp. I'll see you tomorrow. <br/>I'm ready. I'm ready for my mission. <br/>I want a full description of it as soon as you get back. <br/>Look at those clouds, you guys. That's pretty cool. <br/>Look at the pink in the clouds. <br/>I never thought I'd be sitting here on day 26. <br/>Do I look okay? <br/>You look beautiful. <br/>Oh, my God, remember, you have to have lots of alcohol and lots of pig. <br/>That's right. <br/>I've got to eat slow because of my stomach. <br/>Yeah, go real slow, and get really silly and have so much fun. I'm so happy for you two! <br/>Sean and Paschal won a helicopter ride and awaiting them will be a Marquesan feast. And I'm happy for them. Sean deserved it. After all of the mess that some of these people in the Rotu tribe put him through, he was down, but he was never out. <br/>See you when we get back. <br/>I'm about to start crying with these guys. I'm so happy for them. <br/>Oh, my God, I feel like they're going away. <br/>They're only going to be gone a couple hours. <br/>I know, but it's exciting. It's so exciting, isn't it? <br/>Pap, look how beautiful that is. <br/>We're going to see this thing all the way through, buddy. <br/>Yes, sir, man. <br/>This is getting ready to be awesome. <br/>I'm going to tell you, man, I love you, Pappy. <br/>You too, my man. <br/>Now this is what I call a reward right here. <br/>Unbelievable. <br/>Look at us! <br/>Hello! <br/>This is crazy. <br/>Look what we have coming here. <br/>Pappy and I are standing there, like, okay. All of a sudden these Marquesan men come down the hill with these horses. <br/>My name, Akatini. <br/>Paschal. Akadimi? <br/>Akatini. <br/>Akatini. <br/>Sean. <br/>I got to get the wild one? <br/>Your horse. He's okay. <br/>Okay. The only horses I've been on are merry-go-rounds in Central Park. Where does my other foot go? Okay. And it was a bit scary, because it was huge, I mean, horses are big animals. I hope these horses are all right. If they decide they want to throw you off, you're on the ground with broken bones. Nice horsey, how you doing? Oh! He's biting him! Oh, my God. I want off. <br/>Okay, come on here, on this horse, with me. <br/>And the last thing you want to see is two horses, or the horses like biting each other and just... and just... Oh, see! But the Marquesan men seem to have them under control, I'm like, no, this is not going to work. It really hurts. Wait, my balls. My balls. It really hurts. Oh, my God. You got to remember, we're not on flat land, we're on like a mountain cliff. So if you fall off, you're falling off the damn mountain with a horse under you. This is the kind of stuff that scares me. <br/>It was a long ride for some of us not used to horses, but Sean began to loosen up and began singing, and after they made some different arrangements. <br/>âª I'm chilling on a horse with Marquesan men âª Everybody knows that we want to do it again I said... âª Oh, I hear the drums. <br/>We're getting close. <br/>What?! What?! Yeah. Marquesan forever! <br/>Yahawa. <br/>Yahawa. <br/>Yahanewi. <br/>Yahanewi! <br/>This is better than Gilligan's Island. All right! What you doing afterwards? <br/>My name is Layla. <br/>Layla, hi, I'm Sean. You're very pretty. A little too young for me, though. We get to the beach and these two beautiful, although young, Marquesan women lead us to these two beach chairs with these huge pillows with these two huge coconut drinks. Here's to you Pap. <br/>You too, baby. <br/>Success and happiness man. <br/>I wish our team could see this. <br/>Well, who knew that a little black boy from Harlem would be here with a judge... A Southern white judge. <br/>A Southern white judge from Georgia. I dig the fate in that, the irony in that. <br/>Two days ago, I would have mortgaged my house on the fact that Sean was going to be voted off. But things have dramatically changed. Sean, while he may have some problems, he's honest. He's straightforward. That's all I can ask. <br/>Sometimes relationships start out rocky and to look and see where we ended up, man. The sky is the limit for all of us. <br/>We became much closer than we were, and I feel very close to him. I feel very fortunate to know him. That's what's good about this game, you never know what's going to happen. <br/>I'm ready to eat, man. Are you? <br/>It just can't get any better than this. <br/>Folome? Oh, follow you. <br/>Follow? [speaking foreign language] Pork? After we finished our drinks they took us to the Marquesan oven. There's a ceremony where they bury food for a certain amount of days. That's how they cook their food, underground, with the heat and the volcanic rocks. There was a roasted pig under there with plantains and potatoes and roasted goat. Oh, man, look at the... Look at the meat, Pap. <br/>Can you believe this? <br/>The Marquesan people, when they were going through their tribal ritual, I don't know how to put it in words, for me to be here on this island in the South Pacific, with all the history it has, you just have to sit down and comprehend and savor the moment, because this is not going to happen again probably in my lifetime. [speaking in foreign language] And then both over here. <br/>Oh, man. Oh, man. <br/>Heavenly Father, we thank you for this food which we are about to receive and Lord we thank you for the Marquesan people and their beautiful, rich culture. I thank you for bringing Pappy into my life and I pray this is a life-long friendship, Lord. Through your son, Jesus Christ name, we pray. Amen. <br/>Amen. <br/>After having a diet of nothing but taro root and shellfish, to have this stuff-- unbelievable. I mean, we should have paced ourselves a little more, but we... I feel like Julius Caesar, man. <br/>It's unbelievable. <br/>The ladies, the ladies, the ladies! [singing in native language] This is one of the best fish I've ever eaten in my life. While Sean and I were at the feast, the rest of the tribe was probably fixing their dinner, getting things ready, the same old crap we've been eating. This is incredible. Incredible. <br/>Well, here we are. <br/>It's so much easier having just one meal a day really. <br/>Yeah, it sure is. [belching] Excuse me. That means you enjoyed it. <br/>I didn't feel bad for the others because Pappy and I were smuggling food for them. We had one napkin underneath the table and one hand, even though there were eyes on us, we had a move where maybe I'd block for him and we'd drop all kind of stuff and then ball it up in our napkin, and stuff it in our pockets. <br/>Take this home to my sweet thing. I've got a pocket full, man, I've got a whole bag full. Sean and I were brought out into a circle where they danced around us and asked us to dance with them. But what really made it funny, we had stuffed all kind of food in our pockets before then to bring back to camp, and I promise you my pants were at my knees most of the dance because the weight of the food was causing my pants to fall down. We looked at each other, two guys from different walks of life, 10,000 miles away from home, in paradise, and said, you know this is incredible. I will never hear another tribal drum beat that I won't think about that day, and bring a smile to my face. <br/>Thanks. Thank you so much. [speaking in native language] My brothers! These Marquesan people, you could tell that the ritual and the dances they were doing were authentic, and you could tell that the love they gave us was real. Whether we got voted off first, or 9th or 16th. I don't know what to say. It felt good to get away from the island and not think about the game and just remember what it's like to be a human being. Like that, bam, bam, bam. I feel the same way. <br/>We did miss our island I feel the same way. <br/>We did miss our island I feel the same way. <br/>We did miss our island I feel the same way. <br/>We did miss our island family. When we came back, the welcome we received was awesome, it was nothing but hugs and kisses. I think they were happy to see us and once we told them we had food, it was on. We took out the food, put it out. I mean, they looked like roaches around the table. <br/>Fish and fish. <br/>Oh! Oh, my God. <br/>Paschal, thank you so much, for bringing food back. That is so nice of you guys. <br/>Even though they may be the same people who vote you off, there's a human side that you do realize, and it was exciting coming back bringing food for the tribe, because the best victories are the ones you can share. <br/>Paschal, I'm so proud of you that you smuggled. You're the best. <br/>Breakfast is served. You're the best. <br/>Breakfast is served. <br/>Oh, man! <br/>We're talking a real breakfast. Never again will I throw away a banana. I'll never let one get so ripe that I'll throw it away. <br/>This morning, I felt desperate. I felt absolutely desperate. I was not ready to leave the game. I talked to Rob this morning and I said Rob, basically the only chance we've got is to see if we can get Paschal and Neleh on our side. I don't know if it's going to happen, but, I said, that's the only chance we have to stay in the game. <br/>Tammy, make a left so you avoid the water. <br/>Neleh and I were approached by Rob and Tammy, and wanted to talk about how the game has unraveled. <br/>Want you to know that when John said he was speaking for a group all the time, he wasn't. <br/>It was like a final gasp. "We really weren't in with John. We didn't know what John was doing. He didn't speak for us." No one ever came to me and asked me. So I don't want to be held accountable for what John said. I'm associated in that group, and no one ever came to me. <br/>And it was just, it wasn't sincere and it just didn't make sense. <br/>No one, in the whole period of time, did anything remotely to disassociate yourself with him or to say, "Hey, John, that's your opinion and things may change. <br/>We didn't know what he was talking about. <br/>He never told us what he said to you. <br/>Paschal and Neleh, obviously don't believe everything that we're saying. I've never lied and they know that. I've never lied to them since day one. You want to believe what you want to believe. <br/>The only thing is, Paschal and I deserve a fair chance at this, too. <br/>Bottom line is, sit down. Do you want to be standing next to Sean and V. in the end? <br/>I want to be standing next to somebody that I really have some confidence that they never told me anything that was distorted and in order to manipulate me. <br/>You can't say that without talking to me, you can't read my mind. If this is what they choose, if Neleh and Paschal choose to have Sean or V. standing next to them, I'm not going to stand there and beg for anything. It's a little personal to me and it kind of hurt. I said what I had to say and that's it. That's the end of my business with them. Like I said when I'm on the branch just let me know, all right? <br/>Rob got up and walked away because I guess he feels that we don't trust him and that we trust V. and Sean more than we would them and blah, blah, blah. I think pretty much he just got caught in his own game and so now he's just trying to manipulate us a little bit, and we're definitely not falling for it. Rob is definitely pouting right now. I mean, maybe he just needs time to think, I don't know, but he's definitely having a real bad attitude. <br/>We're going to go get taro at the waterfall, you want to come? <br/>I got something that I got to do. <br/>Yeah? <br/>People don't like that I'm a little grumpy, hey, I don't give a fat ass what you like. This is me. You don't like it, I could care less. You still got to live with me for a couple of days. And if I win immunity, you're going to have to live with me for longer than that. <br/>The General, to me, is a bull in a china shop. He's hard to deal with. He does things only when he wants. For me, I've had enough of him and Tammy. I don't want to cook on the green wood, because it takes so long to get going. <br/>I'm burning it all in the next four days. <br/>What? No, I just don't want to cook on it. <br/>I'm just saying I'm burning it all in the next four days. <br/>Great, we burn the whole house down. <br/>I'm saying, I cut it all, I'm going to burn it all. <br/>Cool. To put it blunt, I have no intention of sticking with Tammy and Rob. They weren't people that I trusted from the get-go. I guess you would say I'm letting people know in little ways that I'm no longer part of any alliance, that I'm kind of off on my own. So I ended up making some shell jewelry just so everybody had something. I'm still working on a few, trying to fit in here. <br/>Oh, how darling. <br/>Oh, give me a smooch. Thank you. That is darling. You're going to get a name as a jeweler out here. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, that one's cute. <br/>Oh, that looks good. <br/>Zoe is sucking up and making everybody jewelry, because she wants to be their friend and she wants them to like her and she thinks that by them liking her, she's not going to get voted out. <br/>How about a bracelet, I would love a bracelet, though, actually. <br/>But you know, the thing is, it's funny, because when Zoe sits there and does these sucking up things, and it's so fake, and it's so apparent that she's being fake, I just don't understand how it's not apparent to everybody else. <br/>You are seriously the most tender-hearted person. <br/>We're going to have fun today. <br/>Yes. <br/>There's mail. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>There's mail you guys! There's mail here. <br/>Stilts. <br/>Oh, my God. "Don't care if you're big, if you're not you'll be taller, maybe strength could help, or be a plus if you're smaller. Practice does make perfect, so play with these all day. Fail to heed this warning, be the next to go away." Oh, my God. <br/>Tree mail for the immunity challenge we got some stilts. I'm not sure what it's going to be like tomorrow, so we're just going to practice and hope it goes good. <br/>Balance is the key. <br/>You know what, it was fun watching everybody practice on those stilts, because they sucked. <br/>Oh, man. No good. <br/>It didn't look like they were going to get the hang of it. <br/>That was my practice. <br/>The challenge is going to make or break me basically. I have to win, or I'll get the boot tonight. I actually went down to the beach like far away where nobody could see me practice. But I'm not out of it. Not yet. Not until I hear my name read at Tribal Council. <br/>Probst: First things first, as always, give me that necklace back. <br/>It doesn't want to come off. <br/>Probst: Immunity, back up for grabs. Okay. For today's immunity challenge, it is Marquesan stilt fighting which is something that is still practiced out here for fun and entertainment. Very simple. Two at a time, you'll enter the ring facing each other. First person to fall off is out. You've randomly picked numbers to decide who will pair off against whom. We'll work our way through a series of heats until we are left with one. Big stakes, obviously. Right now, it's one in eight. Win this, you cannot be voted out tonight. You're guaranteed a one in seven shot at being the sole Survivor. Take your spots, wait for my go. All right. First two up. V., General, mount your stilts. <br/>This is going to be funny. <br/>Probst: I'm going to say Survivors ready. You step on with one foot, then I'll say go. You have you to have both feet on. Survivors ready. Go. <br/>Oh, that was close. <br/>Probst: V. wins the first one. You're here. General, you're out. Next two. Kathy, Paschal. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Good luck, you guys. <br/>Pappy! What are we doing? <br/>Probst: Survivors ready. Go! That's it. Paschal, moving on! Next two. Tammy, Neleh, let's see if somebody can do the impossible and stand on these for more than a second. Survivors ready. Go. That's it. Tammy moves on, Neleh you're done. Good effort, guys. Sean, Zoe. <br/>Here we go, boys and girls. Giddy up. <br/>Probst: Sean and Zoe, trying to move on. Survivors ready. Go. Sean, you're out. Zoe moving on. General, Kathy, Neleh, Sean, you're out. We're down to these four, V., Paschal, you're up first. <br/>All right, baby. Here we go. This is for immunity. Moving on to the next round. V. and Paschal, Survivors ready. <br/>Come on, V., baby, concentrate. <br/>Probst: Go. V., you're in the finals, Paschal, you're out. Tammy, Zoe. Winner moves on to the finals. Survivors ready. Go. You all right, Zoe? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Zoe is out. Tammy, squaring off against V. <br/>Good luck, girls. <br/>What do you think, baby girl? <br/>Probst: Here we go, for immunity, Tammy and V. Survivors ready. Go. That's it. Tammy, wins immunity again. <br/>Yes, yes, yes! <br/>Probst: Very much earned. <br/>You have no idea how much I needed this. <br/>Probst: You cannot be voted out tonight. <br/>Whoo! Yes! <br/>Probst: Tammy obviously safe tonight. Everybody else vulnerable. Tribal Council in a few hours. You can head back to camp, I'll see you in a while. <br/>I'm so happy for you. see you in a while. <br/>I'm so happy for you. <br/>Thanks, Rob. Don't give up, I mean, keep thinking positive. It could go either way tonight. Paschal really likes you. Sean really likes you. <br/>That's okay. <br/>I think the foregone conclusion was that Tammy would be voted out, and of course Tammy, since she's won immunity, she can't receive any votes. So, you know, the consideration I think is going to be Rob or Zoe. <br/>You know, between Zoe and Rob, Zoe's just been a hard worker from day one. I know we need to get rid of her because her chance of winning immunity over Rob is a lot bigger. [whistling] But the way Rob's kind of been lately, just kind of down and depressed, maybe it will work out better that he leaves tonight. His attitude has just been horrible, nobody wants to be around him any more. <br/>Cool. <br/>I could care less if I'm the next person to go, because I know I'll be here to the end on the jury anyway. I can accept my fate, as long as everybody else can accept their fate when I make my decision in the jury. <br/>Probst: I'll now bring in the first member of the jury. John is here merely to observe. He won't be speaking to you, and you should not direct any comments to him. For a moment, let's just put the vote aside. We're 27 days in, I want to get a gauge of what this has been like for you guys. Sean, what's it's been like for you? What have been the moments where you thought, man, I'm here. I can't believe I'm out here a month living on my own. <br/>For me personally, it's been really difficult not talking to my mom. And... it's like, when I won the challenge with Pap, I just think everything I accomplished is because of my mom. I don't really have a father. So the man I am today, is... See, Jeff, I tell you, man. <br/>Probst: General, any revelations for you while you've been out here? <br/>Yeah, the last three days have been my days of reckoning. <br/>Probst: What do you mean by that, in what sense? <br/>I analyzed myself, and I analyzed the people around me, and I've seen changes. I've seen one person who was in denial of their past actions and alliances and sucking up to the powers-that-be right now. And I've seen people who have been looked upon as nobodies become great players in this game. I came here with pride, dignity, integrity and a backpack. I leave with another thing, I leave with a couple of bonds and a couple of friends and relationships that I hope will take to the rest of my days. <br/>Probst: Zoe, is there a moment that stands out after 27 days on a deeper level? How well you've done, how tough obstacles you've overcome? <br/>Oh, certainly, certainly is. Things have changed, like the way I've conducted myself has been a bit difficult. But other than that, I'm still a play hard, work hard, play hard sort of person. <br/>Probst: All right, it's time to vote. But first we have this matter of immunity. Tammy wearing it, well earned. She can certainly give this immunity away to somebody if she chooses to. Any chance of you giving that up? <br/>You know what, there's no chance in hell I'm giving this immunity up. I worked way too hard for it, and I know my butt's on the line. If I gave it up, I have no doubt that I'd be voted out tonight. So I'm not giving it up. <br/>Probst: All right. You cannot vote for Tammy. Everybody else is fair game. Zoe, you're first. <br/>I had enough. Zoe, you're first. <br/>I had enough. Zoe, you're first. <br/>I had enough. <br/>Maybe this will be my one valuable contribution to the tribe. <br/>This is strictly a strategy tribe. <br/>This is strictly a strategy tribe. <br/>This is strictly a strategy move. I'll see you on the other side. <br/>Zoe, I'm voting you out tonight, because, well, I just don't like you. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes have been read votes. Once the votes have been read the decision is final. The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Zoe. Rob. Zoe. Zoe. That's three votes Zoe, one vote Rob. Zoe. Four votes Zoe. Zoe. That's five, and that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Zoe, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Strength and honor. <br/>Probst: It's time for you to go. Well, there's no doubt that Survivorcan be very challenging, both physically and mentally. But as we saw again tonight, don't ever give up or count yourself out of this game, because you never know how it's going to play out. You can head back to camp. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor... The tribe wakes up hungry, so Kathy sets out for food. <br/>I'm going to see if I can whack it. <br/>Happy birthday, girlfriend. <br/>Probst: Vecepia celebrates her birthday, but it's not exactly a happy one, until the tribe learns their next reward is on a cruise ship. <br/>Go! <br/>Well, it was a bit of a surprise to be voted off this early. But I guess that's just the way it goes. I did my best, work hard, play hard. Zoe is, uh... she's leaving, that's that, I guess. Sweet dreams to all.
