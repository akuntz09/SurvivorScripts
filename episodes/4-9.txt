<br/>Probst: 24 days ago, 16 castaways were marooned in the middle of one of the most remote places on Earth, the Marquesas, part of Tahiti's mystical islands. The eight remaining members of the Soliantu tribe have now made it past the halfway point, each one now has a one in eight chance of winning a million dollars. Tonight, in a special edition of highlights and never-before-seen footage, we'll take a closer look at their adventure thus far. <br/>This was my luxury item. It was a voodoo doll, so we're going to put the other team's name on it and start jabbing the hell out of it. <br/>[singing in Spanish] These three new members brought, I guess, a sense humor that I don't think we had before, and it was fun. <br/>We wanted a word that we can shout out when we win, and sounds good. <br/>Today is the last day we will ever get a fair chance. <br/>If we make a pact that we're going to go in firestorm... Obviously, when Paschal and Neleh started to see what I've been talking about all along, so now the new agreement we have is that we're going to vote John out tonight. <br/>Probst: Day 1 found 16 out tonight. <br/>Probst: Day 1 found 16 strangers marooned thousands of miles from the nearest continent. As two separate tribes, Maraamu and Rotu, they found themselves paddling the rough waters of the South Pacific, looking for their camps. But for some, the journey was nothing like they expected. <br/>If we see the flag, then we'll just go right. <br/>We got to go around that little jutty thing there. <br/>When we first jumped off the boat there was definitely a lot of excitement going through everybody's head. In the beginning it's all fun, and then you're paddling for about ten, 15 minutes, and reality sets in. It hits you that there's nobody here to help you. The fact of the matter is you really have to get there. <br/>Which way we going? Left? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It looks like a beach in there. <br/>Rocky beach, though. Rocky beach. Take it out. Look at it. It's a rocky beach. <br/>It looked like according to the map it would take us maybe 15, 20 minutes, if we were lucky. But then once we saw the points of where we were actually going ahead of us, that was an insane distance. It was very scary. <br/>Probst: The Maraamu tribe's arrival was nothing short of majestic. <br/>Sarah's arrival was almost like Cleopatra. It was like the servants are paddling and lifting, and she's sitting on the crate, looking so marvelous with her boobs hanging out and her Goldielocks in the air. <br/>Land ho! Save it. You know, this is Survivor. Ain't nobody trying to look at you like that here. <br/>Home sweet home. <br/>Probst: Rotu's arrival was a joyous one. <br/>Woo! We made it! <br/>Probst: Until they discovered that their crate held a minimal amount of supplies. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! Oh, it's not as much as we thought! <br/>The stuff that was in the crate: we got a map to our spot. We got two pots and a pan, two machetes and a small knife and then a magnifying glass. <br/>Probst: And starting a fire became an exercise in futility. <br/>It's working. <br/>Probst: But at Maraamu, it was a different story. <br/>People know that I'm into yoga, and in yoga you breathe from the diaphragm, so I was able to take nice, long deep breaths. <br/>Probst: Using Peter's breathing technique, Maraamu quickly had fire. <br/>Woo-hoo! <br/>Keep it going. Keep it going. <br/>As night fell on Maraamu, Rob and Sarah were immediately drawn to one another. <br/>Is it comfy? <br/>Oh, yeah, it's like a waterbed. <br/>Oh, cool. <br/>Dude, I could go to sleep right now. <br/>Last night there was definitely flirtation around Rob and Sarah. <br/>We fill this thing up and let it cook in the sun all day tomorrow. <br/>There you go. <br/>We get a hot tub. <br/>That's an idea. <br/>They got into the raft that we had paddled in on, and they kind just hung out away from everybody else, and, you know, were there pretty much the whole entire night. So at that point, I'm now, that was another, you know, question. Well, what are they saying, you know, are they flirting or are they making an alliance? <br/>Probst: As the sun rose on the morning of Day 2, Kathy was still determined to start a fire. <br/>This is the most important thing right now. So we need to get a group dynamic. <br/>How many hours I spent yesterday, I'm wiped. <br/>How many hours did you spend yesterday? <br/>You tell me. <br/>Not many. I don't think we spent more than two. <br/>Probst: John, for the sake of tribal harmony, decided to work on the fire himself. <br/>That's nice. <br/>Yes! <br/>We got fire! <br/>Fire! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: The tribes received their first tree mail. <br/>Oh, no, we're on the water! <br/>Probst: And Rotu planned on sticking it to Maraamu in the first immunity challenge. <br/>This was my luxury item, a voodoo doll. So we're going to put the other team's name on it and start jabbing the hell out of it. Pass it around. Everybody gets a shot. <br/>I'll get their swimming feet. <br/>I'm going for the shoulder in case we're rowing. <br/>It won't go in his head. <br/>I'll stick it in the arm and hopefully their arm will be sore. <br/>Probst: At the challenge, the tribes were told they would be entirely on their own. In addition to no food, no water, you're getting no fire help from us at all, of any kind at any time. Survivors ready?! Go! <br/>Woo! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Rotu easily won. And on Day 3, the game became a harsh reality, as Maraamu realized they had to vote out one of their own. <br/>My strategy is to keep the strong as strong as possible. <br/>Peter got on our nerves a little bit this morning because he came up and called us all over and wanted us to talk about what the strategy of the game was and how he was going to do it. <br/>I'm not this magical mystical person, all right. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I think if you want to get the truth on the situation, right, you just can look in someone's eyes. That's not like, "Ooh." Some people are going to look you in the eye and lie to you, though. <br/>I know you don't have an alliance. <br/>I mean, an alliance right now means absolutely nothing. <br/>I don't know that. <br/>There is no alliance here. <br/>I don't know that. <br/>Right now the game has shifted from survival to a paranoia state. I believe that Peter has taken it to the extreme. <br/>I can see the faces, and I know the, you know, I know the outcome of tonight's vote. <br/>You don't know what you're talking about. From based on what people are looking? People are tired. People are hungry. <br/>It's better for me to talk about it because I won't be able to talk to you tonight. <br/>Probst: Even though Patricia and Sarah received votes, Peter's instincts were correct. He was the first person voted out. First person voted out of the tribe: Peter. The tribe has spoken. On Day 4, the mood at Maraamu was upbeat. The tribe awoke to Sean's radio program. <br/>You got today's weather report, Hunter? Hold on. Let me change the station. <br/>Hunter Ellis with today's morning weather! <br/>Probst: At Rotu it was all work and no play. Until Kathy found food. [whistling] Hey, you guys, get over here! I'm serious! <br/>We got seven. One, two, three, four. <br/>Whoa, that was slimy. <br/>I know, but a lot of meat here. A lot of protein we're looking at. <br/>Probst: And to flavor up their meal, Gabe added some spice to the mix. <br/>These are peppers. <br/>Peppers! <br/>Way to go, guys. <br/>Way to go, guys. <br/>Ah! <br/>Coconut, lime and peppers. <br/>Put in some more peppers. <br/>That looks yummy. <br/>Wow! Wow! God, that's good. <br/>Probst: Back at Maraamu, Rob was trying out some inventive cooking of his own. <br/>I'm going to fry up a little papaya. I have no idea how this is going to turn out. <br/>I'm not going to eat it until you eat it. It's your concoction. <br/>It's pretty good. It tastes like... warm papaya. <br/>What do you think? <br/>Probst: But Patricia wanted to get the chores done. <br/>Here's the plan: you all get ready and go gather some coconuts, and we're going to finish getting these flat rocks. <br/>How can we get coconuts without a stick? <br/>Well, he'll get you a stick. He's a great stick hunter. <br/>Work needs to get done and if somebody is not going to step up to the plate, I don't mind telling somebody, "Look, let's go." First it was endearing because it just seemed natural. Now it just seemed like, "Oh, no, Mama got to work. Mama can't sit down." Now listen to me, I'm only going to tell you this once. <br/>I heard it this morning already once. <br/>Tool tree. <br/>I already heard it. I know. I know everything needs to go back where you find it. I know. <br/>I'm tired of trying to... Where's the knife then? <br/>Probst: On Day 5, the tribes competed for some valuable fishing gear. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Mask, snorkel, fins. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Survivors ready?! Go! Rotu! [cheering] Rotu won the mask and fins, but there were more victories to come. <br/>What do we got today? <br/>Oh, my God, it's a fork. <br/>Probst: Getting a utensil in the mail on Day 6 could only mean one thing. <br/>A food challenge. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: And it was. The tribes had to eat ... a Marquesan delicacy of fish soaking in fermented sea water. Rob choked and Maraamu lost their third challenge in a row. So Maraamu headed back to Tribal Council, where in a 4-3 vote, Patricia, known as the tribe's mom, was voted out. Patricia, the tribe has spoken. Maraamu lost their second tribe member. It's time for you to go. Day 7 would prove to be a lesson in pain for Rotu. While snorkeling for food, John was the first victim. <br/>I landed right on top of a sea urchin, and embedded about 12 sea urchin needles in my fingers. I got to go back in and get somebody to pee on it. That's what you're supposed to do from that kind of a venomous sting from a sea urchin is to urinate on it. I need somebody who can pee on my hand. Someone have to go to the bathroom? <br/>Probst: Luckily, someone did. <br/>I didn't even think it was weird that she was squatting down and I had my hand between her legs. <br/>Good thing you had to go to the bathroom. [laughing] Probst: On Day 8, bamboo and rope were delivered to the tribes. <br/>To what do we owe this honor? <br/>Probst: I come bearing supplies for your next challenge. At Rotu, the tribe was dealt a painful blow again. <br/>A big rock got in between my shoe and my foot and just sliced up my toe nicely. <br/>Probst: And again. <br/>John actually stuck his hand underneath a rock and an eel bit him. <br/>Oh, my God. What is going on? [shouting] Probst: But not even injuries could stop a closely-knit Rotu tribe as they beat Maraamu in a tight finish in the reward challenge. Rotu! <br/>Ready to rock? <br/>Everybody wants to go. <br/>Probst: Maraamu set out for a hike on Day 9. <br/>Patricia went for a hike one day by herself, found a stream on the other side of the hill, so I think that could be something that we need to go check out. It's also a good opportunity for us all to get out and do something together as a tribe. <br/>Is the creek definitely down there? <br/>It ends down there. It's pretty direct. It's just it's steep. <br/>This is doing a whole lot for me. I thought it was an easy walk to the creek. <br/>It comes right out of the rocks, a little bit to this side of where I think the river is going to come out. <br/>But after all of this, we're going to spend ten minutes and leave? <br/>And then climb back up? <br/>Hunter, he's just up and always busy, the thing is we didn't come here to exert ourselves in this tropical heat. Damn all this other work. We need energy to get those damn challenges. <br/>Probst: Go! In the immunity challenge, the tribes battled it out in a coconut maze race. <br/>In the hole, here we go! Yeah! <br/>Probst: Maraamu lost yet again. So Rob strategized behind the scenes and became the tribe's puppet master. <br/>It's important for me to have people on my team that are going to do what I tell them to do. Game always keeps you thinking. It really does. Fear keeps people loyal. If they're afraid they have something to lose, then they'll do what they tell you to do. That's straight out of The Godfather. It's true. <br/>Probst: It was a shocking Tribal Council, as Maraamu voted out the strongest member of their tribe. Hunter, the tribe has spoken. First step: pick a disk. Doesn't matter. It's totally random. Follow your gut. Go wherever you want. On Day 10 the tribes came together for the biggest twist in the game yet. Okay. Zoe, you're first. Step off your disk. Pull off your new buff. Take your old one off. Put your new one on. The tribes were randomly switched up. Some friendships remained together. <br/>Yeah! Pappy's on our team. <br/>We got Pappy. <br/>Probst: While others were torn apart. Rob, you're now a member of Rotu. Sarah. All right, Sarah, same buff, still a member of Maraamu. But for the remaining 13 survivors, all bets were off. It was time to play a brand-new game. At Maraamu, Kathy, Paschal, and Neleh were pleased with their new camp. <br/>That forest is so beautiful. <br/>Well, let's show you guys around. <br/>This is a breadfruit. This is a mango tree. <br/>All you got to do is pick up the limes off the ground. <br/>I just got off of a tribe that would get up at dawn, check the pig pit, you know, and go out and forage for shells. So to us, we feel like it was a four-star hotel and that there's fruit on the table, so it was pretty nice. <br/>Probst: For the new members of Rotu, life seemed pleasant as well. They were ecstatic when they saw their new water source. <br/>Yeah! <br/>It is so, so good. <br/>I didn't even know what else to say. <br/>I'm loving it. <br/>Good, I'm glad to hear it. <br/>I am loving it. <br/>Now they see this, I'm like, hey, you know, this ain't too bad. [singing] Probst: On Day 11, Sean introduced his new tribe to the radio program. <br/>Girl, you know you... [singing] When we landed here on Rotu camp, we told them about some of the things that we did on our camp, like the early morning show, and they were more than willing to try it. <br/>No longer are they down with the Maraamu, we could never say our name right, so I'm not going to say it right this morning. <br/>Rotu can do! <br/>That's right: Rotu can do. And we're going to head over and get a food report from our main chef, Johnny Pots and Pans. <br/>At first I thought we might all start off with a little raw coconut, and if we go searching pretty hard, we might find ourselves some sea urchins, but watch those spines. Back to you. <br/>These three new members brought I guess a sense of humor that I don't think we had before, and it was fun. <br/>Why don't you give us an overall report on things on this island. How are things going on the Marquesan Islands? <br/>[with Australian accent]: Well, we're all settling in to our new habits, looking for a new place to hang up some clothes, find a place to sleep, all try to get together. I'm sure we can do it in the speed of the Thames here. I'm sure we can pull through in the end. Back to you, Rock. <br/>They seemed like they enjoyed it. We all can sit around and have fun and laugh and bond in other ways than just working. <br/>The in people will be sporting lovely new buffs. You can wrap them around your head in any manner whatsoever. <br/>You can sit down and self-disclose yourself and laugh, and seemed like the radio show was well received. That concludes our wake-up show for this morning. Stay tuned tomorrow same time, same station. We'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a good day, and remember, God loves you. <br/>Probst: The two new tribes squared off against each other in an immunity challenge on Day 12. Today's immunity challenge is all about the weaving. Each of you have a woven tapestry that is scrambled. It's very simple. The first tribe to unscramble it correctly wins immunity. Losing tribe: Tribal Council tonight with me. But Rotu continued to function like a well-oiled machine, and they beat Maraamu again. <br/>Here it comes. <br/>That's it. That's it. That's it right there. <br/>Probst: Rotu! <br/>Rotu! <br/>Yes! <br/>All right! <br/>Probst: So the new Maraamu headed to Tribal Council, where the old Rotu members, along with Gina, voted Sarah out. Sarah, the tribe has spoken. Paranoia swept over Rotu on Day 13, and John became suspicious when Gabe said he wasn't there to play the game. <br/>What are the ethics in this game? <br/>To me it's tell the truth. Be honest. Are you saying that you would lie to win this game? <br/>I'm not even here to play the game, man. <br/>Gabriel said he's not playing the game. I just, I don't believe it. I mean, you are here to play this game. You're not here on a commune. You know, this is not the '60s and, you know, free love and all that kind of stuff. <br/>Probst: To solidify his position, John decided to create an alliance with Tammy, the General and Zoe, with Gabe to be their first victim. <br/>Basically, I want four people that I know will not vote for me, just plain and simple. So what we're shooting for is the final four is myself, you Tammy and Rob. Just voting as bloc. Trust me 100%. I mean, I don't even know what else I can say to you. Split my hand open and rub blood on you. I mean, I have your back. I mean, you are, you are my partner. <br/>You swear you're not playing me. <br/>Tammy, on my mother's [blip] life. <br/>If you're playing me, I swear I'll kick your ass. <br/>Probst: At Maraamu, the little tribe of four was a huge underdog. <br/>Heavenly Father, we're very grateful for this wonderful day that we have ahead of us and we ask thee if thou would please help us find all the things that we need to today. That we may be able to work hard together as team. <br/>I think we all have a spirit and it's here. This is our time now. <br/>Probst: Gina was correct. It was their time. At the reward challenge the tiny Maraamu tribe emerged victorious. <br/>Hurry! Hurry. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: Maraamu! Maraamu won the opportunity to get back into the game. Their reward: a two-minute raid of Rotu's camp. Go! Five, four, three, two, one. Go! Five, four, three, two, one. Raid is over. <br/>Forgot this! <br/>Should have taken the frying pan. <br/>Probst: By Day 14, John wasn't certain he had the votes to oust Gabe, and went to Sean to secure his vote. <br/>I need at least one of the other new members so I didn't get myself caught in a tie, in case Gabe figured out that I was trying to vote him out. Planning to vote Gabe tomorrow, but I did want to know that if we lose that, you're not going home. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay, but you have to be tight. You have to keep your mouth quiet. <br/>I think it was a mistake that John told me that. If they're going to vote for Gabriel, they needed to just do it and let me sit there and think that I was going to be next. All I'm saying is, stay tuned. <br/>Probst: The immunity challenge required the tribes to build an SOS signal. <br/>Put one in each corner. <br/>Even though it looks like Fat Albert and the Cosby kids' SOS sign, it still, I think it's pretty good, considering what we have. <br/>I made him wear a hat today because he looks like a pilgrim boy. Look at him. <br/>All right, guys, this is it! <br/>Probst: The little mouse tribe of Maraamu roared again. <br/>By waving the American flag as part of their distress signal... Blow your horn! <br/>Probst: Maraamu finally won immunity. [horn blowing] All right! [cheering] Yeah! [cheering] Probst: Knowing that Gabe was the target of Rotu's alliance, Rob approached Gabe in the hopes of having him vote against John. <br/>My only question I have for you is, if you were 100% set in the way you wanted to play the game. Definitely a twist, the way we shake things out. <br/>Rob Mariano was explaining that it was probably going to be me voted out tonight. Rob wanted to know if I would make an alliance with him and Sean and V, and change the tide. <br/>Probst: But in the end, Gabe was true to his word. He wasn't there to play the game. He was only there for the experience. And everyone else was there to play the game, and Gabe was voted out. It's time for you to go. On Day 16, Maraamu was one happy little family. <br/>I feel stupid that we can't catch a fish. Oh look! I love it. <br/>Kathy and I were talking about how I want to go back to grad school and, you know, do some things and how she's going back to school, and we talked about my dream job. <br/>What's your dream job? <br/>My dream job is to have a cabin restaurant, like a made-out, like a log cabin restaurant, in Alaska. <br/>Gina, she's so aspiring for dreams. She's bone honest, sweet, hardworking, incredible work ethic, and driven. <br/>I would come out and greet everybody and give them free coffee. <br/>Gina, I think it's a great idea. <br/>Every once in a while maybe I'd make some homemade biscuits. <br/>I want you to be there now, though. You could do it. You could make it happen. <br/>She was saying I got to do it now. You know, you got to do your dream job now or it won't happen. <br/>When you hear somebody that's got that much energy for an idea, you should implement it now. You can always go back to school. <br/>I just don't have the money. <br/>It would be great to have her find her dream. Then you can help out with the wildlife area. <br/>That would be awesome. <br/>You should do it. <br/>It was relaxing for me. Felt like I was talking to a really good friend about what I wanted to do with my life. <br/>Probst: At the start of the wanted to do with my life. <br/>Probst: At the start of the reward challenge, Maraamu was astonished to discover that Gabe had been voted out. <br/>They voted Gabe off. <br/>Probst: Survivors ready?! Go! <br/>Come on. Rob, stop, stop, stop. <br/>Probst: You're still in this. Let's go. <br/>Come on, you guys! <br/>Good job. Come on, guys! <br/>Okay, sharp, sharp, sharp. <br/>Come on! <br/>Probst: Against all odds, the tiny tribe beat Rotu yet again. Maraamu wins. Feast. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: And sat down to a picnic lunch. <br/>Oh, my God, it's a picnic! <br/>I love picnics. <br/>Probst: On Day 17, the stress of losing three challenges in a row reached a boiling point, and Rob Mariano called attention to the Rotu alliance. <br/>You, The General, Tammy and John, you guys don't have an alliance, the four of you? <br/>We have a friendship, not an alliance. <br/>That's interesting. I knew she was lying the second she told it to me. I could just tell. You're telling me straight up that you four don't have an alliance, you four over here? <br/>How could you say that we don't, I mean, you'd have to be blind not to see that. <br/>Zoe just told me straight up in my face not even five minutes ago, John. <br/>Maybe she's not thinking that way. Hey. <br/>Have I ... you so far? <br/>John, do I have "stupid" written on my forehead? <br/>If there's a traditional merge and we all merge today, three of them and seven of us, those three go first. That is my absolute word. <br/>Probst: John, Rob and Sean agreed that if the tribes merged they would vote out the members of Maraamu first. <br/>Don't try to [blip] me. <br/>I won't. I promise. <br/>I'm taking your word. <br/>I will. Okay. <br/>Same thing, buddy. <br/>I think to a degree I may have convinced him that I'm part of the team now. I want him to trust me, but he shouldn't. <br/>Probst: But Rob still felt his neck was on the line going into the next immunity. <br/>This immunity challenge is critical to me. If we don't win this challenge, then I'm probably gone tomorrow. <br/>Probst: Survivors ready?! Go! Rob stepped up, took charge of the Rotu tribe, and came up with a huge victory. Rotu wins! <br/>This is it! That's what it's all about here. <br/>Probst: On Day 18, the family of Maraamu had to face their toughest decision, but in the end, old tribal lines held fast. <br/>Gina, I'm taking you to Alaska and I'm going to get that restaurant for you. <br/>Probst: And Gina was the sixth person voted off the island. Gina. The tribe has spoken. <br/>Mail call. <br/>Probst: On Day 19, tree mail instructed both tribes to send one member on a journey. Kathy and Rob met at an ancient paepae, where they were told that the two tribes were being merged into one. Tonight the new tribe will be born under your guidance. They celebrated with pizza and beer. But the partying soon turned to more important conversation. <br/>Zoe and I were like the moms. You know, we're cleaning up. <br/>Really? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>You and Zoe feel you're pretty close? <br/>Zoe and I were like moms. "Let's clean the place up." Unreal. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's unreal, the lies going on. She told me that she was voting you off. What exactly did Gina say about me that made me out to be such a bad person that they want to vote me off so bad now? <br/>You're a lazy bum and you don't care about anything. <br/>Really? <br/>Probst: With this new information, Kathy and Rob felt vulnerable. They decided they would never vote against each other. <br/>Do you want to make a pact, me and you? <br/>Do you want to? <br/>They'll never know. It will be just me and you. <br/>All right. <br/>All right, let's do it. <br/>Probst: The next morning, Kathy and Rob awoke for breakfast. <br/>This morning was amazing. Not only was it just being on that pillow so wonderful, and having soft cushions under my body, when I woke up I saw a tray of food, I just felt it was a dream, I truly did. <br/>This is out of control. They're donuts. <br/>They're donuts? <br/>Pastries. Well, to the new tribe, new beginning. <br/>Yes. <br/>We really pounded out a name for our new tribe. Soliantu. Soliantoo. Soliantus. Soliantus. We took the sun, and we took the word "alliance," and we took the word "sacred," and we wanted to use those three words and then we also wanted a word that we can shout out when we win, and it sounds good. <br/>Soliantu. Sacred alliance of sun and fire. <br/>That looks pretty cool, you know that? <br/>Yeah, it does. <br/>Teamwork. <br/>Kathy was awesome company. We named the new tribe, painted a new flag, and we got everything done we needed to get done. I just had a wonderful time. <br/>What a wonderful, wonderful night. âª Probst: They returned to Maraamu, where they told Neleh and Paschal they had five minutes to load their supplies onto their raft. <br/>We got five minutes. We got to get everything we got on the raft! <br/>Everything! <br/>Come on-- everything we got! Everything! Get the kettle. Get the knives, Neleh! Touch the raft! <br/>You did it. <br/>There were only four of us and we did it. We're a team, all of us. There's a merge. No, there's a merge. <br/>Oh, really? <br/>We have so much to talk about. Here you go, man. <br/>Okay, so this is our new buff? <br/>This is it. <br/>Here. <br/>Probst: Greeted by the members of Rotu, Rob handed out the new buffs and displayed the new flag. <br/>What's the new name, guys? Cool. <br/>Soliantu. <br/>Soliantu. And that name means... I can't remember. I keep forgetting. <br/>It has all of our initials. Sacred allegiance to the sun. <br/>Sacred allegiance to the sun. <br/>Good job. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Soliantu! <br/>One, two, three, Soliantu! <br/>Probst: But the good cheer and camaraderie at Soliantu disappeared on Day 21, when Rob confronted Zoe. <br/>Zoe, you didn't have an agreement about taking everybody from their side of the island off? You don't remember anything about that? <br/>No. <br/>See, this is what I mean. Unbelievable. And Kathy wasn't your first choice as soon as she got here? Tell the truth, for once, will you? Tell the truth. <br/>Probst: Kathy, disillusioned and angry, fled to the waterfall. <br/>Zoe's lying to me. They're all lying to me. They're all lying to me, and I'm being played as a pawn. A pawn. I need the immunity because I'm getting the ax. I don't know. It's just not adding up, but I'm going to trust what Rob told me and I need immunity to stay in the game. <br/>Probst: Survivors ready?! Go! Out-balancing the others on an unsteady platform in the rough surf, Kathy won immunity. Kathy wins immunity. You want this? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Come get it. <br/>All right, baby! <br/>Probst: Turn around here. [cheering] Yes! Back at Soliantu, Rob accused John of backing out on his word. <br/>What happened about my word is my bond? <br/>Oh, yeah, mine was like fine, but as soon as you doubletracked and circled back and came up with other ideas, then it's like I'm done. <br/>Probst: But John accused Rob of breaking their agreement when Rob spoke to Kathy. <br/>Don't tell me one thing and just because I think about something or just because I talk to somebody, then all of a sudden it's off. <br/>To be honest I'm not going to have this conversation. I'm not going to decide for myself until we get there tonight. <br/>I thought we had an agreement. <br/>We did, until you went to Kathy and told her at the other side, and said they're going to vote you out first. <br/>I did not say that. <br/>I'm not going to have this conversation. Don't lie to my face. <br/>There we go. Now it's on, man. <br/>Probst: In the end, all the drama in camp brought about Rob's demise. Even Rob's former Maraamu ally, Vecepia, wrote his name down at the voting booth. Rob, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Probst: The next day, Kathy confronted Zoe. <br/>There was never any intention of voting you off, no way in hell. We wanted to get Rotu back together as a team. <br/>Zoe just lied to me point-blank about the fact that the tribe had definitely scoped me out for the first vote off when we merged. Oh, my God, look, you guys. <br/>Probst: The tribe received materials to build kites for the next reward challenge. <br/>Too much wind. <br/>Oh, my kite is going to be a miserable failure. <br/>Oh, stop it. <br/>I'm serious. <br/>Oh, go fly a kite. <br/>Probst: So they did. Run, John run! Competing for the chance to have a Snickers bar and then go scuba diving, the survivors attempted to fly their kites into the Marquesan sky, but it was Kathy who went the distance. <br/>Yeah! Yeah! Woo! <br/>Probst: Underwater, Kathy experienced the serene world of Marquesan marine life. On land things weren't as peaceful, as Sean fought for his survival. <br/>I get frustrated because I feel like nobody is playing the game, and I feel like we've kind of succumbed, and let the four people run the show. <br/>I telling you, I'm going to talk with Kathy. <br/>I totally agree with you. I think Tammy and John are playing a game and they're playing it so hard, it's obnoxious. <br/>If you're in agreement, me you and V are on the same wavelength. <br/>Yeah, we are. But we just need to get Paschal and Neleh. And you know what, I think we can do it. <br/>My boy. <br/>Probst: On Day 24, the immunity challenge was a game of elimination, but Sean, Vecepia and Kathy saw it as the alliance's arrogant display of the pecking order, showing who they would be voting out next. <br/>This is the order of how it's going to go. <br/>Way to go. <br/>I swear we could take them out. I swear we could. <br/>Probst: Tammy won immunity, and she, John, Zoe and the General openly celebrated their victory. <br/>I almost was going to do you because I hated to get Paschal another time. <br/>It didn't seem to bother you that much. <br/>Probst: Neleh and Paschal were also angered by the arrogant conduct the foursome had displayed during the challenge. <br/>There was a pecking order and we were included in it, even though we were told that that wasn't true. <br/>Probst: And decided to take matters into their own hands. <br/>I'm not going to go out fifth or sixth. We've worked too hard. <br/>Probst: In the shelter, Vecepia apologized to Sean for siding with the alliance and voting against Rob. <br/>They came to me, six or seven days after we were here and told me they wanted to be part of the fivesome, and I said if you do not lie to me, I will go five with you, and then once we get the five, it's every man for themselves. <br/>I just wish you had trusted your brother a little more. You saw what they did to me and Rob. I said these guys were... Exactly. If I've done wrong with you, I apologize. I'm saying this right here and now. Straight up, I apologize to you. <br/>Probst: With Vecepia on board, the fivesome decided somebody needed to be done. <br/>Today is the last day we will ever get a fair chance. After that it's going to be four and four. It's going to be up for vote and it's just the way I feel, you guys, right now, and I'm being honest with you. <br/>Obviously, Paschal and Neleh started to see what I've been talking about all along, that the four horsemen have an alliance. They've been switching on and off, first with me and Rob, then with her and Paschal. So now the new agreement we have is myself and Neleh, V, Paschal, and Kathy are going to vote John out tonight. <br/>Probst: That night at Tribal Council, they struck back. The eight person voted out, the first member of our jury: John. You need to bring me your torch. The alliance of John, Tammy, Zoe and the General was broken when John was voted out of the tribe. The tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Good night. John was the eighth person to go, but he will return as the first member of the jury which will ultimately decide who will be the sole Survivor. Over the next 15 days, the Soliantu tribe will experience the culture and the game in ways unlike any survivors before them. Join us as the adventure continues. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:John's departure marks a new era at Soliantu. <br/>It's a new day we're starting here! Friends become bitter enemies. <br/>From the get-go I didn't like you. <br/>I have changed my opinion of Zoe. Zoe is a bitch. <br/>Probst: And two lucky survivors get away from it all. Now for the reward: an authentic Marquesan feast. <br/>Give me the radio right there. It's the wake-up show. It's the wake-up show. It's the wake-up show. It's the wake-up show. Rah! Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning. <br/>Ding, ding, ding.
