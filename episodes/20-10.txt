<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor: With their numbers dwindling, each of  the Villains were making plans for a possible merge. <br/>If we merge, I have control of the Villain camp, complete control. <br/>Probst: Russell thought he was pulling all the strings, but Parvati made  moves of her own. <br/>Another immunity idol is hidden at your camp. <br/>Probst: She tracked down a hidden immunity idol, telling only her friend  Danielle. <br/>Right now, Russell doesn't need to know. <br/>Probst: While the outcasts, Courtney and Sandra, merely wanted to survive. <br/>It's inevitable that me or Courtney are going home. <br/>Probst: The Heroes were equally sure a merge was coming, and even more sure  that Russell was on the outs with the Villains. <br/>That women's alliance looks very strong. <br/>Probst: So they came up with a plan to pull in Russell by giving him an idol  with instructions to take out Parvati. <br/>This is your chance to show you're not a Villain. <br/>Probst: At the last immunity challenge...  Done. <br/>Probst: Heroes win immunity! ...the Heroes celebrated another win as J.T. gave Russell an idol and a chance to become a hero. [thunder rumbling] But Russell's a Villain. <br/>You don't hand the enemy the idol. <br/>Probst: In a brilliant double-cross, Russell kept both the idol and his ally,  Parvati...  Shut up! <br/>Probst: ...as he and his female accomplices laughed all the way to Tribal Council,  where they voted out Courtney. Courtney, the tribe has spoken. And Sandra was left all alone, angry at her own tribe. We are now even-- five Villains, five Heroes. With both tribes equal in number, the real battle is about to begin. Who will be voted out tonight Who will be voted out tonight in Heroes vs. Villains? in Heroes vs. Villains? <br/>Day 25. Man! <br/>We need a change. <br/>I just want to see Russell and four girls. <br/>Oh. We seriously better merge today. <br/>I mean, it's just, like, "Oh, day 25." Something's got to happen,  you know. Please, give us a merge. Give us a challenge. Give us anything. <br/>This is exponentially worse than I ever remember it. <br/>I hope we get treemail. That's all we can do. <br/>Us five, the family, have been together a pretty long time now. It's taking its toll on us. <br/>I hope I'm not pissing anybody off too much. <br/>I think we all are. <br/>I try and keep quiet...  I'm pretty sure I'm annoying someone. <br/>Oh. Oh, my gosh! <br/>What is this? <br/>"Heroes..."  BOTH: "...do not open this box until you have the key."  "Make room in your camp."  BOTH: "Company will be arriving soon."  Oh, my gosh. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>They're bringing the key. <br/>They're bringing the key. <br/>They're bringing the key. "Company will be arriving soon." "Company will be arriving  soon."  I wonder what that key is to. <br/>I know. <br/>Oh, I hope it's a treasure. I do love treasure. <br/>A hidden treasure. <br/>Oh, we've got something...  You guys, it's an Hawaiian sling...  That's a real one. <br/>...with a key on it. <br/>With a key. <br/>And a note. <br/>A key? <br/>What is it the key to? <br/>All right. [overlapping chatter]  A map! <br/>It's a map to the Heroes' camp. <br/>Get the hell out of here. Let me see. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Do we know...? <br/>We are merging! <br/>Do we know how to...? Okay. <br/>We just got treemail, and it comes with a map to our new home. If it is a merge, it's okay with me, 'cause it's right up my alley. We're going over to the Heroes home turf and weeding them out one at a time. We know for a fact that I have to go to J.T., explain to him why Parvati's  not gone. <br/>We are going to go to J.T. and tell him you used his idol...  Be, like, "Than you."  ...to save yourself last night. "Thank you." You're going to play that. <br/>He's going to say, "Why didn't you vote Parvati out?" What I want  to do is say that we both played an idol at the same time. <br/>Because I thought the girls were revolting. <br/>No. <br/>So then when the next time we go to Tribal, you're going to tell them that  you're voting with them. <br/>Right. <br/>And they want Parvati off first. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah? <br/>So then you're going to use the idol to save yourself, and then, who's going  to go home, one of them? <br/>Yeah, J.T. will go home. <br/>Shh. Shh. Quiet. <br/>With all the other Heroes, we do. <br/>You know, Sandra's walking around. Just be quiet. <br/>I know! <br/>So be quiet. <br/>Right now, I do think I have the only hidden immunity idol in pocket. The people that know about it are the people that have to know about it-- my  whole tribe, except for Sandra. We're not going to tell her anything. That idol is going to help the Villain tribe weed out one of their members on  the Heroes' tribe. I'm going have them eating out of my hands. <br/>Five of us, five of them. They're going down in flames. <br/>Are we ready for war? <br/>Are we ready for war? <br/>Villain flames. <br/>Villain flames. <br/>Villain flames. [theme song playing] [theme song playing] [theme song playing]  The Heroes are just going to have to watch out, 'cause the Villains are coming. Right now, Russell and I have both of the hidden immunity idols that are in  this game, which puts us in the king and queen position. <br/>Here they are. Here they are. <br/>Huh? <br/>Here they come. <br/>Well, the queen has to keep some secrets, so I would like to keep my hidden  immunity idol a secret. Only my lady in waiting, Danielle, knows about it, and the king will not know  about my hidden immunity idol until the time is right. <br/>This ought to be interesting. <br/>Oh, yes. <br/>We need help! <br/>We need help! <br/>Heavy! <br/>Heavy! <br/>First thing I noticed when I looked down the beach and saw the Villains  coming was Parvati. Then, you know, I saw Russell's legs behind the Sears box, and I was, like,  "Oh, thank God."  How are you? <br/>I got it. [overlapping chatter]  Oh, my God. <br/>My back. <br/>So I figured Russell played the idol. Parvati had to have played an idol. Therefore, there's no idols in the game. Parvati's got to be the first to go. It's a known fact. <br/>Good to see you, brother. <br/>Brother. <br/>What's up, Russ? Welcome aboard, my friend. <br/>Hey, let's see what we got in the box. [overlapping chatter]  Yeah. <br/>Yeah. [whooping and cheering]  Oh, fudge. <br/>"Heroes and Villains, replace your old buffs with the new ones."  Yay! [cheering]  "You must come with a new tribe name, design a new tribe flag and begin  the next phase of your journey."  They're like half a feet. [whooping and cheering] [overlapping chatter]  Hey there's ham. [overlapping chatter]  Be careful with the eggs here. <br/>Oh! <br/>It's a big ham. [Jerri whoops]  It's a party! <br/>Yum. <br/>Oh, my God, that's so good. <br/>When the box got sprung open, you know, the vegetables and fruit are flying,  you still in the back of your mind think, "We're still two tribes,"  but when the black buffs came out, that tells you real quick, old tribes are  done. tribes are done. This is a whole new ball game. This is a whole new ball game. <br/>Winners. <br/>Winners. <br/>The what? <br/>The what? <br/>We're all winners. We're all all-stars. We're all something good and positive. Why do you have to keep the Villain attitude? But I guess that's what Villains do. [overlapping chatter]  It's in the... it's in the... [overlapping chatter]  Really? <br/>Oh, you're not far from me at all. <br/>No deal. I live in...  Do you know I learned to weld last year? <br/>Really? <br/>I MIG weld, yeah. <br/>No way. <br/>I built a covered wagon from scratch. <br/>Conestoga wagon. No way. <br/>Yup. <br/>He had a parasite in his butt. You can see it. It's like a worm in his skin. <br/>If I had that, I think I'd cut myself. Had to take it out. <br/>And it moves, and he can't get rid of it. <br/>Bamboo burns too quick. <br/>It's hot. It's hot. <br/>You all right? <br/>Fine. <br/>Parvati? <br/>What? Nothing. Leave me alone! No, I don't want to talk. None of the Heroes are happy that I'm here. They wanted to get rid of me before, and they're probably all be shocked that  I'm still here. I definitely don't feel like I'm part of this tribe, so I'm thinking they're  going to vote for me because they want me gone. Like, do these people think I'm stupid? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Do they think I'm stupid? Like, Amanda's played with me before. <br/>They think they have the game right now, and let them think that. Just play... play it like...  That's what... That's what I am. I'm, like...  Play right into it. <br/>That's what I was doing, and now it's just, like, I'm over it. I'm offended by how these Heroes are treating me. They don't know it yet, but they're about to be picked off one by one. Don't talk to me. It'll get you in trouble. It'll get you in trouble. <br/>No, I won't. <br/>No, I won't. <br/>You know, this is the first time I've been comfortable since day four. day four. <br/>I imagine so. <br/>I imagine so. <br/>The hidden immunity idol? <br/>The hidden immunity idol? <br/>When did she use it? <br/>When did she use it? <br/>We both stood up and looked at each other. <br/>Oh, man. [laughter] [laughter] Oh, man. Oh, man. <br/>So everybody but Courtney. And Courtney voted for Jerri. Everybody else voted for Courtney. This is where I stand. This is it for me. So don't even have any doubt. <br/>I don't doubt you. I don't doubt you. <br/>Don't have any...  Don't have any... Don't even worry. Don't even worry. <br/>Just let this happen. <br/>That's right. <br/>Just breathe. <br/>Breathe. <br/>Breathe. <br/>That's exactly right. <br/>That's exactly right. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Giving Russell the hidden immunity idol could blow up in my face. I mean, he could have never been going home. You know, he could be the leader of the girls over there. Do I believe it? Not a chance in the world. So I mean, I trust him So I mean, I trust him explicitly. explicitly. explicitly. <br/>Exactly right. <br/>Exactly right. <br/>Hook, line, and sinker. They're biting everything I tell them. This is going to be way easier than I thought. <br/>You're darn right. <br/>That's right. <br/>That's good. It's going to be a wonderful It's going to be a wonderful thing. thing. <br/>You know how some people forgive but don't forget? Well, I don't forgive and I don't forget. The Heroes don't know that Russell is the kingpin and that Parvati's his  right-hand man. Russell's trying to play up this thing like all these women are about to get  rid of him. I hope I get my revenge 'cause it's going to be good. <br/>So what happened last night? <br/>Courtney's the last person from my alliance. They didn't want me and Courtney over here together. That's why Courtney had to go. I'm the last one standing and I have to be babysat, and if they have to be  babysat, and if they catch me talking, I'm gone next. catch me talking, I'm gone next. You guys are done, starting with the men. You better-- I got to-- I got to keep you on the low-low. I'll tell you on the low-low. <br/>Right. Okay. <br/>But whatever Russell says, agree to it, but he's lying if he says that the  women are running the show. <br/>Got you. Sandra just gave me some really good information. Russell told us that Parvati used her immunity idol last night. That is not true. I don't know if we're getting played or not, but Russell might be running the  show, and if Sandra is true-- and I have to believe Sandra-- Russell is  playing us. Boy. This is where the game gets This is where the game gets crazy. crazy. <br/>All right, now scramble that joker up or them eggs are gonna be brown on the  bottom. <br/>Do you guys want your egg boiled or scrambled? <br/>Oh, I don't care. <br/>Um, whatever you guys do. <br/>Okay. Just asked if you cared. <br/>Whatever you have. Whatever you're inspired to make, I'll eat it. make, I'll eat it. <br/>Okay. [both chuckle]  Okay. [both chuckle]  The egg is really good. <br/>That is a damn good breakfast. <br/>Yup. <br/>Yup. <br/>I'm gonna find a banana. <br/>I'm gonna find a banana. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Oh, my God, it's like all I need. You're not hungry? <br/>Y'all still got breakfast on me, don't ya? <br/>We just ate. <br/>Why do they want to eat again? They can't be eating all their food. <br/>Look at this one. [chuckles]  They're the greedy-ass, eating-ass, pain-in-the-ass tribe. In our Hero tribe, coconuts are aplenty. Anyone can open any coconuts they want. With the other food: the bananas the papayas, we divide that up a  hundred-percent even. I cannot wait to start voting some of these Villains out of our camp. <br/>That's more than I eat in three days. <br/>I'm already tired of 'em. <br/>Not very good. <br/>And they've only been here two days. <br/>This one might be. It's rotten. <br/>Alls I'm saying you got to watch 'em. You got to watch all of them. If Russell isplaying us...  He's not. <br/>Now listen to me. Don't be so quick. Let me just tell you the scenario, okay? If Russell didn't use that damn immunity idol, and he's got all of us voting  for Parvati, those four can put one of us out. <br/>But I'm telling you Parvati wouldn't be in this game if she didn't play her  idol. No question. I asked. I believe that. <br/>I don't think so either. <br/>You have faith in Russell. Don't trust him. He's on the Villain side for a reason! J.T. believes wholeheartedly that Russell is on our side and indebted to us now. I don't. So we might just plan on changing our five votes just before we go in there;  whoever Russell says. <br/>Yep. <br/>We don't put that person, but we look right at him and say, "Okay. Stay the course."  Yeah, we will do whatever it takes, the first vote. <br/>We're together to the end, brother, to the end. <br/>We're good. &gt; All right, this is, this is...  Rupert is really skeptical of Russell, so just to make sure Rupert's okay,  the Heroes are gonna tell Russell we're voting for someone, and then the five  of us are gonna vote for someone else. So it's good just to test. We don't want to make a dumb decision, and then be, you know, lose our lead. That would be awful. You're getting paranoid. <br/>You are. You're sweating, you're scaring yourself into a panic out here. You're not pulling...  I-I just want to make sure one of us... Fine. <br/>Rupert-- [laughs] there's a reason that I've been doings a Rupert strategical  play for him thus far because he needs to be told where to vote by someone he  can really trust, and let that be done. So I just keep reminding him of that, like, "Rupert, think "about  this a minute. "Do you believe what Sandra "told you or do you believe the obvious  truth? I mean...  It's, it's smelling fishy. <br/>If Sandra's story turns out be true, and Russell did not play the idol, then  that means I'm probably going home the next Tribal Council. I don't know. Do I believe it? Not a chance in the world. But you never know in this game. <br/>Russell looked me right in the eye and swore on his kid's life that he was  with us. And anybody that will do that, right away I don't trust 'em. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay, then don't  Okay, then don't trust Russell. trust Russell. <br/>About you? <br/>About you. <br/>They're gonna try to vote me out. <br/>Yeah, they want you gone. Like, that's why I don't know what to do 'cause it's weird, Parvati. Like, I have no power over here. Like, everyone's freaked out about you. <br/>I don't know. I just... So if I don't win today, then they're voting for me? <br/>Probably. <br/>And Russell with probably  And Russell with probably vote with them. vote with them. <br/>To get with Sandra? <br/>To get with Sandra? <br/>Rid of Sandra. <br/>Rid of Sandra. <br/>Amanda and I got a chance to talk for the first time sinceto the merge, and I  think I got probably half her story. So I haven't decided the best plan yet because with her, I don't know if  she's telling me the truth or not. Will you tell me who everyone's voting for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Just at least tell me. <br/>No, I will. <br/>Okay. Do you swear you're gonna be really honest with me? <br/>Yes, I have been. I told you all that stuff. <br/>Okay, so then I have to tell you something. <br/>Okay. <br/>You have another one? <br/>Yeah. <br/>How did you get another one? <br/>I'm crafty. [laughs]  Love it. Loving it. I had a conversation with Parvati. I didn't tell her everything, but I told her enough to get her to trust me,  and she told me that she had the idol. And I like Parvati and everything, but she makes it to the end of this game,  she's gonna win again. <br/>If we're working together, then we're working together then we're working  together and I trust you. and I trust you. However the vote shakes down, I'm gonna make sure my butt is safe, no matter  what. But I'm gonna try to make it work that none of our Villains are going  anywhere tonight. <br/>But you trust me? <br/>I trust you. <br/>I trust you. Should we do a secret handshake? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Blow it up. <br/>Blow it up. [both laugh] [both laugh] [both laugh]  Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You're now merged as one tribe. What's the new tribe name? <br/>Uh, Yin Yang. It means good and evil. <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready to get to your first individual immunity  challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right, first things first, I will take back things first, I will  take back the immunity idol. the immunity idol. Tribal immunity is no more. Individual immunity is what you seek. For today's challenge, it's very simple. You will hold onto a pole for as long as you can. If you fall off, you're out of the challenge. Last person left hanging on their pole wins immunity, guaranteed a  one-in-nine shot at winning this game and the million dollars. Losers, Tribal Council. Somebody will be going home. Make sense? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: We'll draw for spots,  Probst: We'll draw for spots, we'll get started. we'll get started. All right, everybody climb up. take your spots. <br/>Oh, here we go. It's kinda hot up here. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Geez. <br/>Oh, my God, this is scary. <br/>Oh, my God, this is scary. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Probst: And this challenge is on. Everybody finding their spot. Amanda, Donaldson and Sandra slowly inching down the post. Could be a good strategy, could be a sign they're in trouble. J.T., Candice and Parvati have all competed in this challenge in previous  seasons. None of them have won this challenge. <br/>My leg won't stop shaking. <br/>Probst: Sandra already in trouble seconds into this challenge. <br/>I can't get right. <br/>Yeah, I hear ya. You want to do it at the same time? One, two, three. Donaldson steps down. [Sandra groans] Colby-- first person out of this challenge. Sandra steps down. Sandra's now out of the challenge. Colby, disappointed how fast you were out or is something going on? <br/>I knew, I knew it was gonna be quick for me, yeah. <br/>Probst: How come? <br/>Just based on that last challenge we did with the footholds. Not my forte, that's for sure. <br/>Probst: We're down to eight. We are one minute into this challenge, and already, people challenge, and  already, people are struggling. are struggling. Rupert adjusting. Rupert adjusting. Very little room for your toes. Very little room for your toes. Candice, Danielle and Parvati all look very solid. Amanda looks very solid, although she is low on the post. Russell trying to get comfortable. And Russell steps out of the challenge. Take a spot on the bench. We are down to seven people left in this challenge. in this challenge. [Danielle exhales sharply] [Danielle exhales sharply] [Rupert groans] Rupert  struggling. Hanging on for dear life. [Rupert groans] Rupert is out of the challenge. [Rupert groans] And we are down to six people And we are down to six people  left in this challenge. left in this challenge. [Danielle exhales sharply] Been up there just over Been up there just over 20  minutes. 20 minutes. Amanda steps out of the challenge. We are down to five people left in this challenge. [J.T. grunts]  Ah, you thought I was gone, didn't you? <br/>I was, like, "What"? <br/>No, I was just getting a little break. <br/>Probst: J.T., were you just playing around? <br/>No, I almost fell. <br/>No, I almost fell. [Jerri, Danielle laugh] [Jerri, Danielle laugh]  Probst: J.T. readjusting all over the place now. over the place now. [J.T. groans] [J.T. groans] [J.T. groans] J.T, drops out of the challenge without warning. <br/>Oh, I didn't see! <br/>Probst: We are now down to four people left in this challenge, and they are all  women. women. Candice the lone remaining Hero. Candice the lone remaining Hero. [Parvati chuckles]  Geez, Parvati, how in the heck are you staying on like that? Wow. [Parvati chuckles] I think I'm about done. I can handle the pain, It's the dehydration. <br/>Probst: Yeah, starting to get to you? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Jerri moving down to the lowest foothold. Nowhere else to go. Arms are shaking, legs are shaking. <br/>Good job. <br/>Probst: Jerri steps out of the challenge after one hour, 30 minutes. <br/>Good job, Jerri. <br/>Good job, Jerri. <br/>The bad thing is we drank your water. [Jerri laughs]  Probst: We are now down to three. Candice and Parvati were in their own showdown back in the Cook Islands. Danielle has never done this challenge. She's sitting right in between the two of them. Now been out here one Now been out here one hour, 35 minutes. hour, 35 minutes. <br/>All right, girls, good luck. <br/>Probst: What'd you say, Candice? You're stepping down? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Wow. Before you step down, Candice, I'm curious why in a challenge for immunity in  which of all the people who've played it, you lasted the longest. You're the odds-on favorite to win. You're now-- for no reason-- just going to bow out of the challenge. <br/>They look like they could go for a while. It's true. <br/>Probst: Step out. And with that, Candice steps off the post and is out of the challenge. <br/>Good job, Candice. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Good job, Candice. <br/>Probst: And we are now down to two. All the Heroes are gone. <br/>How you doing? <br/>I'm cool. <br/>You're cool? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Two Villains left, and immediately they start and immediately they  start to talk. to talk. <br/>All right, this one's all yours. <br/>Probst: Parvati appears to be stepping out of this challenge, and she does. And with that, Danielle wins first individual immunity. [applause] [Danielle grunts]  Good job, Danielle. <br/>Nice, Danielle. <br/>Thank you. Yay! <br/>Probst: Congratulations. Danielle safe tonight at Tribal Council. As for the rest of you, after 27 days, one of you going home tonight. You have the afternoon to figure out who it's gonna be. Head back to camp. I'll see you at Tribal. Congratulations. <br/>Yes! <br/>I think Parvati is gonna come up with a hidden immunity idol tonight. But Parvati wouldn't have walked off that pole, but I don't know. That's all part of the plan tonight; to see if I can oust Russell for the  weasel that Russell for the weasel that he is. he is. <br/>It's kinda strange how Parvati stepped down at the end of the challenge, you  know? And she's in such danger and she knows it. So the plans are, tonight, the Heroes are gonna let Russell write Parvati's  name down just to prove his loyalty to all of of us. Me and Candice and Rupert, Amanda, Colby-- five strong-- will write down  Sandra or will write down Sandra or Jerri's name. Jerri's name. Jerri's name. <br/>Right, yeah. <br/>Right, yeah. <br/>Sandra? Jerri done a hell of a lot Jerri done a hell of a lot better than Sandra did. better than Sandra did. <br/>I don't even care who goes home. <br/>I don't either as long as it's not me. <br/>As long as it ain't us. When we come back tonight, they'll be real mad, like, "What in the hell  just happened?"  They think that they got this in the bag. Which tells me that Russell's doing a good job of convincing them. <br/>When I first got here, I tried to tell Rupert that Russell is running this  whole show. And anyway, we talked really, really quick, and that was it. I don't want my big mouth to get me in trouble. I still want Russell out bad. But right now I'm stuck with Russell. with Russell. I'm stuck with Russell. I'm stuck with Russell. <br/>My plan A is to give the idol to Parvati, save herself, and vote out J.T. I don't have a plan B. But I hope for the second time I'm gonna save her with a immunity idol. I have a gift for you. If it was just me, it'd be just me, but I got to keep these four girls on my  Villain tribe so I can get rid of J.T. <br/>Oh, you! You shouldn't have! <br/>There you go. [Parvati laughs] Thanks, honey. [chuckles] Russell just gave me his immunity idol. So that makes me safe for for tonight. And I have my own immunity idol. That also makes me safe for the rest of the game. It's like two little green men protecting me. And apparently everyone else in this game is, like, desperate to get rid of  me. And they said that I'm the most dangerous player out here. So I don't know. I guess they're right. I didn't really think they were right until right now. Now I really think they're Now I really think they're right. [chuckles] right. [chuckles]  What? Being on separate tribes? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I know. <br/>Because I honestly don't know what to do. I want to play with you, but I don't see how we're gonna play together. So the idea is to have Parvati play her idol and vote out Sandra or Jerri. It'll be really crazy tonight if Parvati gives her idol to to somebody. I hope she doesn't. I hope she plays it for herself just so... I mean, it's always good. You never want idols floating around. It just ruins things. She's so dangerous. <br/>I just want to make sure  I just want to make sure it's not me that goes. it's not me that goes. Really? <br/>Just play it. <br/>Just play it. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. I knew that Amanda was lying to me when she told me that they were voting for  me. Like, I know you're trying to get rid of me, but I'll just play along with  you right now. It's, like, "Thanks for looking "out for me [clicks tongue]  buddy."  Just to be safe. <br/>Just to be safe. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>But, like...  I just, I don't know what to do because I'm really honestly, Parvati, I'm so  confused, like. <br/>It's gonna get messy, so I think the best thing that you could do tonight is  just let them vote for me, and just vote with them. Then we'll take it from there. <br/>All right. [sighs]  All right. [sighs] My head hurts. My head hurts. <br/>It's hard to really know who they're voting for. If they say they're voting me out, and I play the idol, then the idol's gone,  and it's just risky. So damned if you do, damned if you don't. Unless, like, you picked the right person. the right person. I hope. I hope. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Coach and Courtney voted out at the last Tribal Council. at the last Tribal Council. <br/>Whoo-hoo! <br/>Whoo-hoo! <br/>Probst: Rupert, what is camp life like, both Heroes and Villains living in  the same spot? <br/>[laughs]: It is... an adjustment. You know, you heard James say the "banana etiquette" thing. I haven't had a ripe banana since... [laughs] since they got here. <br/>With all due respect, there's so many plantains and green bananas that I  don't think we should be penalized for wanting to cook a plantain,  considering the plethora amount that we have. <br/>I don't think there's ever been a discussion about eating plantains. We have a thousand plantains. It's the ripe bananas. We have ripe bananas all the time, but we let them ripen. <br/>But I always feel like I'm walking on eggshells around the camp, because you  guys do things your way, we've done them our way, and now we've come  together, so we need to work out a way where it works for everybody. <br/>I think... I think that, uh, nothing's going to change. There's two separate tribes. The game is on. Let's forget about the green bananas and the yellow bananas or whatever-- so  what? Let's play the game. <br/>Probst: Russell, could tonight's vote dictate the rest of the game? <br/>Tonight's vote willdictate the rest of the game. This is the most important vote that I've ever been a part of. If one of the Villains go home, then the Heroes are going to be in the top  five. If one of the Heroes go home, the Villains are going to be in the top five. That's just how it's going to work tonight. That's going to happen. <br/>Probst: J.T., sound true to you? <br/>I hope that it's true, and I hope it's a Villain that goes home, if it is. <br/>Probst: Was it a crazy day at camp, J.T.? <br/>None of these people want to talk to me, so that leads me to believe my  name's getting wrote down a lot tonight. <br/>I'll talk to you anytime, J.T. <br/>My feelings are already hurt. I don't want to hear it. <br/>Aw! Maybe mine are hurt, too. <br/>Probst: Jerri, can you see what J.T.'s talking about, that you guys were  somehow avoiding him for some reason? <br/>It did feel a little bit like they had a wall up, J.T. in particular. <br/>Russell, is that maybe just paranoia, that everybody's feeling the same thing? <br/>I think that that's exactly what it is, paranoia. You know, I talk to J.T. all the time, all the time. I've probably been talking to I've probably been talking to their tribe more  than mine. their tribe more than mine. <br/>Probst: Sandra, concern you a little, Russell, your Villain tribe mate, is  over there making friends with the Heroes? <br/>No. I mean, we all want to get along. I mean, I talk to everyone individually, "Hey, how you doing, where you  from, where you work," whatever, but as far as strategy, nobody said  nothing to me neither, so I didn't say nothing to them neither. <br/>I feel like everyone's been avoiding me. [laughs]: I feel like a leper on this tribe. I do. <br/>Probst: But is that just because you're used to getting attention all the  time in life? [laughter]  No, Jeff, but you're right. But no. I think... I think it's because everyone thinks I'm such a threat, and so no  one wants to be associated with me. <br/>Probst: So you believe the Heroes have you in their sights tonight? <br/>Definitely. <br/>Or maybe we haven't approached Parvati yet because we know she's going to be  around for a few more days and we'll have that opportunity. So there's another angle. <br/>So in other words, the Heroes might be targeting somebody else on the  Villains. <br/>Maybe. <br/>J.T., has there been any talk in your group about who might have any hidden  immunity idols, if there are any in the game at all? <br/>The idols are a big topic of conversation. It's a mess, and I don't have any idea who might have an idol or who's got  one. I know I don't have one, so I'm pretty worried about it. <br/>Probst: Parvati, topic of discussion on the Villains' tribe? <br/>Yeah, definitely. I mean, we've seen what idols can do, as far as on the Villain tribe. It broke a completely solid alliance and turned the game. <br/>Probst: Well, I don't think we've had a bigger vote. Danielle, you have the immunity necklace. I assume you're keeping it tonight. <br/>Of course. <br/>Probst: You cannot vote for Danielle. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Russell, you're up. Russell, you're up. <br/>You seem like a real cool guy, but it was a real dumb move by giving me your  idol. And because of that, I gotta And because of that, I gotta vote you out  tonight. vote you out tonight. <br/>This is my love letter to you. Since you tried to vote me out, I figured I should return the I figured I  should return the favor. favor. <br/>Hoping my name doesn't come  Hoping my name doesn't come up tonight. up tonight. <br/>I hope Parvati plays that idol and shows everybody that idol and shows  everybody that Russell is a liar. Russell is a liar. <br/>Jerri, we're voting for you tonight because if there is an immunity idol,  you're the least likely person that they would likely person that they would  give it to. give it to. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, idol and you  want to play it, now would be the time to do so. now would be the time to do so. <br/>You know what, Jeff? [others groaning] I think it would be downright depressing to sit and watch  green bananas turn yellow without my debaucherous little Villains, so...  Sandra, that's for you. <br/>Get out of here! For real? <br/>Get out of here! For real? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. And, Jeff... I would just like to increase our odds. So, Jerri, that one's for you, So, Jerri, that one's for you, too. too. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Jerri, Sandra. <br/>Wow! <br/>Probst: The rules of Survivor state that if anybody plays a hidden immunity  idol, then any votes cast against that person will not count. These are both hidden immunity idols. Any votes cast for Sandra or Jerri will not count. Jerri will not count. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote... Jerri. Jerri. Does not count. Does not count. Jerri. Jerri. Does not count. Does not count. Jerri. Jerri. Does not count. Does not count. Jerri. Does not count. Jerri. Jerri. Does not count. Does not count. J.T. J.T. One vote J.T. One vote J.T. J.T. J.T. That's two votes J.T. That's two votes J.T. 11th person voted out and the third member of our jury... J.T. That's three, and tonight That's three, and tonight that's enough. that's enough. J.T., the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. <br/>Good luck, fellas. <br/>Good luck, fellas. <br/>Probst: Well, in a game full of crazy moves, that was one of the craziest. With tonight's vote, it certainly appears that the Villains have the upper  hand, but you know better than anybody-- anything can and probably will still  happen in this game. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor...  Whatever, whatever. <br/>Probst: As Russell loses control of his alliance...  You lied to me. <br/>How did I lie to you? <br/>Probst: ... Sandra takes control of the game. <br/>They're done. So you want Russell gone? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Russell's gone. My target is Russell. I've been waiting to take him down for 30 days. <br/>Yeah, I trust you. <br/>Yeah, I trust you. [Sandra laughs] [Sandra laughs]  I feel like a total idiot right now. It's pretty terrible to be voted out by your own idol. I felt like Russell would vote the way we told him to vote. People are Villains for a reason-- don't ever trust them. Worse than that, don't ever trust women, ever, ever, ever. You can't always win. It was a big move, do or die, It was a big move, do or die, and I died  tonight.
