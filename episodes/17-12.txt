<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously, on Survivor: (gorilla grunting)  Obviously, Bob and I know that our numbers are up. <br/>Probst: Outnumbered five to two, Bob and Corinne hatched a plan. Step one: Bob made another fake hidden immunity idol. <br/>That would fool me. <br/>Probst: In fact, it looked almost as good as the real idol Sugar has had for  most of the game. <br/>Thank God. <br/>Probst: Step two: Corinne told Kenny she had an idol and convinced him to  flip. <br/>Who are you guys gonna take out? <br/>We're taking out Matty. <br/>Probst: Step three: Bob showed the idol to Crystal, and together, they also  agreed to vote out Matty. Then Kenny changed the plan by ordering Crystal to vote for Corinne. <br/>You have to vote for Corinne. <br/>Okay. <br/>If this plan works out, I'll be the biggest strategist in Survivor history. <br/>Probst: Kenny's new plan hinged on Corinne playing the idol, but she couldn't  because it was fake. So Corinne got the boot. Matty received three votes and was fuming. Will Kenny's latest strategic move come back to bite him? Six are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>The vote tonight was four votes for Corinne and three votes for me. And I believe that tonight I got a vote from Kenny, and he wants me out of  the game. You were voting out Corinne tonight. Why did you put down my name? <br/>Because they had the immunity idol. I thought it was the real one. <br/>Don't lie, bro. That's what you're doing. <br/>Once I got back from camp, Matty was super mad at me. I voted for him, and that was strategically a move to gain me jury votes in  the final three. I have been calling the shots since day one out here, you know? I am the mastermind behind everything going on. Both of you, just listen to my story. <br/>I started getting an earload of crap from Kenny, you know, why he did what he  did, and I didn't even want to hear it from him, you know? Don't lie, Kenny. Kenny's playing a game. He's a mastermind. And I'm on to him. <br/>Don't worry. Don't worry. I really like Matty, but he's a huge physical threat. I have a strong alliance with Kenny and Crystal, and that's the best alliance  I've had in the whole entire game. <br/>He's put your name down. <br/>Yeah, exactly. And I still ain't put his name down yet. I owe him, and I'm letting both y'all know, I owe him. I'm really regretting not writing Matty's name down tonight, which is  probably the stupidest move that I've made in this game so far. Hopefully, Matty doesn't win immunity at the next challenge, and Matty needs  to go. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION (theme song playing)  * *  No. (sighs) It's fake. <br/>So you guys did lie to me. And now my game is messed up. <br/>I feel horrible about pulling Kenny in... uh, who's now, he's in a real  predicament, and it's my fault. <br/>Okay. Are you... are you genuinely saying that, or are you just lying to me again? <br/>Bob offered to give me the immunity necklace. I made him feel sorry for me. This is a huge power play. <br/>Um, I feel horrible about it. I made Kenny a promise that I wouldn't play him as a fool and that I owe him  something, and I want to be, you know, a man of my word. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, you will race out into the swamp through a  series of obstacles and retrieve a ball. You'll then race back to the start, toss the ball into a net, then you head  back out. First person to get three balls in their net wins reward. The winner will be flown via helicopter to Loango National Park, where you  will visit a gorilla sanctuary sponsored by Africa's Eden. This is a great opportunity to see, up close and personal, these fascinating  animals. You will then enjoy a nice meal, a good night's sleep, with a bed and a  shower. You'll return to camp in the morning. In addition, the winner of this challenge has the power to send one person to  Exile Island. Worth playing for? All right, we'll draw for spots, we'll get started. Here we go, for reward. Survivors ready... Go! Into the swamp... through the net...  Ow! <br/>Probst: Kenny to his station first. Matty right behind. Bob now working on his. Matty quickly has his ball and is heading back. Kenny has his first ball, heading back. Bob's heading back. Once you get it in the net, head back out and do it again. Bob now back, taking a shot. Got to get it in the net before you can head back out. Matty has his first ball in. Heading back out. Kenny has his first ball in. Kenny heading back out. <br/>Damn! <br/>Probst: Bob gets one in the net. Matty through the course and now heading back with his second ball. All three guys have hit their shots. The women have yet to make one. <br/>Damn! <br/>Probst: Matty taking aim. Just misses. Kenny now back with his second ball. Bob not panicking, not rushing. Matty drills his second one. Bob, with one shot, drills his second ball. Kenny hits his second one. He's heading out. It is Matty, Bob, Kenny heading out for their third and final ball. Matty with a big advantage in time. Bob now getting in on it. It is Matty, Bob, and Kenny. First one to get their ball in the net wins reward. Kenny just misses. Matty just misses. Bob scores! Bob wins reward! <br/>Good going, Bob. <br/>Oh, it's all good. (indistinct chatter)  (grunts) (laughter)  Probst: Bob, come on over. Your reward is pretty nice. Do a little gorilla watching, nice meal, good night's sleep in a bed. An adventure like this is always more fun if you can share it. Choose one person to go with you on this reward. Crystal. <br/>Oh, thank you! <br/>Probst: Crystal gonna join Bob for a nice reward. Two's fun; three's a party. Pick one other person to go with you. <br/>Kenny. <br/>Probst: Without hesitating, Bob chooses Kenny. <br/>The way I'm playing the game right now is, I need Crystal and Kenny to work  with me. Because I am trying to play for all the marbles in the pot. <br/>Probst: All right, Bob, one more big decision. You have three people left. One of them is going to Exile Island. <br/>Miss Q can go. Susie Q. <br/>Probst: Susie Q, Exile Island awaits you. Grab your stuff. <br/>I'm right here. <br/>Probst: You will return in time for the next immunity challenge. Straight out this way. (indistinct talking) Sugar, Matty, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>Bye. Have fun. <br/>Bye, guys. <br/>Crystal and Kenny drive me nuts. They've spent way too long in this game. My goal with Sugar is to get her to align with me and vote Kenny and Crystal  out. <br/>Probst: Bob, Crystal, Kenny, helicopter coming in. Have a great time. Head on out. * * (trumpets)  Oh, my God, this is my first time in a helicopter, and, yeah, I was enjoying  it. Looking down you see nothing but pure jungle and savanna. It's-it's... it really is Eden out here. (speaking in native language)  Oh, my God. <br/>We walk into this hut and the first thing, of course, we see on the table is  food. You have your fresh mango, your fresh watermelon, your salami, your cheese,  your olives, your tomatoes. <br/>Ooh, ooh! <br/>These are good. <br/>Thank you, guys, for joining me. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Cheers. <br/>I wish I could have brought everybody. <br/>I think if Matty doesn't win tomorrow, you know, that would be a good thing. <br/>I hope the next move is Matty because if it's not Matty, it's going to be one  of us. <br/>Can we get Sugar on board with that? It would be nice if we could take Matty out, and it's nice that I think I  have won the confidence of Crystal and Kenny. And I think my integrity has stepped in here and is working. Kenny believes I will give him the immunity if I win it, and the reason he  believes me, I think, is, because I do have integrity. <br/>I mean, if you win immunity, I could take a risk. You don't have to give it to me the first time. But...  If I don't give it to you the first time, I'm not a man of my word, right? <br/>Yeah, that's true. <br/>Uh, but if you want to... You want to analyze and get me off the hook. Originally, I told you, I would give it to you right away. I think the best thing is for you to make the decision. <br/>Yeah, and I'll be like, "I think you should keep it tonight, Bob."  Or I'll say, "I think that I'm in danger."  This is the plan: at the next Tribal, I'll be wearing the necklace I haven't  won yet, and if Kenny feels that he needs it, and if he wants it, I will give  it to him. If he thinks it's better off protecting me, he'll say, "No, keep  it."  I think all of us look so dirty. I hope they're going to let us take a shower and get cleaned up before we go. <br/>See the gorillas? <br/>Mmm. <br/>I'm so excited. To take a shower was invigorating. We had soap and towels and washcloths. And put on some fresh clothes, and we were just like, "Wow, you smell so  good."  Oh, man! <br/>It was pretty cool. <br/>Wow, Bob. <br/>A big improvement. <br/>I know. <br/>The green does kind of look good on you, too. <br/>It does. <br/>It's even got pockets. <br/>Hey, guys. <br/>Hi. <br/>Welcome to Mbenge, the Gorilla Project. <br/>Nice to meet you. I'm Bob. <br/>Nice to meet you. <br/>Nice to meet you. <br/>After we cleaned up, some rangers came in and spoke to us about the Gorilla  Project. It's called Africa's Eden. <br/>So, we're a sanctuary and a rehabilitation center. <br/>So, the rangers explained everything about gorillas. They said they were really in danger because of people poaching them in  Africa, getting gorilla meat, and what's left is baby orphaned gorillas, and  they have nowhere to go. <br/>We walked down to an observation platform, and we sat there for quite some  time, just sort of getting them used to us. And then Mbakai, the large silverback gorilla, stepped out. His head is enormous. We were 25 feet from him. He was right there. I'm not usually spiritual, but there was a feeling like there was a  connection between these great apes and myself, how they were looking at us,  and we were looking at them. And it just... It did sort of rock my soul. <br/>Coming to Exile, I know that Sugar has the idol, so I went ahead and took my  chances and just enjoyed the comfort and the fruit just to get away from the  whole game. People back at Nobag have no idea what they're missing. It was pretty easy choosing the comfort, actually. But the one great thing about being at Exile is it takes you away from the  game. You can just step away and say, "I don't have to think about anything  right now." I think I'm going to have to change it from "Sugar  Shack" to "Susie Shack."  Well, we went on a cool reward and they didn't get to do anything. <br/>I've been gunning for Crystal and Kenny this entire game. <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah, really. <br/>Well, I'll tell you what. You better win that thing tomorrow because you're the biggest threat now. I wouldn't want to be Matty right now because he knows he's next. If it's not Bob, who is it? In my alliance with Kenny and Crystal...  It is your alliance. <br/>It's me and Kenny and Crystal. <br/>So now you're choosing them as your alliance? Brilliant thinking. You're the evil three. <br/>We're not the evil three, dude. <br/>I don't know, man. <br/>It's mostly with me and Kenny. Unless, you know, he could totally be taking me for a ride. <br/>He is taking you for a ride because his main alliance is Crystal. I know for 1,000%. <br/>I'm sure Kenny is probably lying to me, but Matty is the stronger physical  threat, so I don't know who to believe. I don't know who to turn to. I'm pretty sure you and Bob will win. <br/>Well, you have the idol. <br/>Nobody's going to vote for you. <br/>We'll see. <br/>Not with having the idol. <br/>Oh, Matty. I'm certainly not going to give Matty my idol. Screw that. At this point, I'm using my idol to make sure I'm in the final five. <br/>If Bob takes the next immunity challenge, they're voting for me. <br/>I would say that's accurate. <br/>My status now is I'm basically on my own. And I'm not getting any help from anybody, and if I don't win the next  immunity challenge, I think I'm packing up my bags and going home. <br/>Yay! Was it the best ever? <br/>Yes. <br/>All right, tell us about it. <br/>Look at this. <br/>Your shirt is clean? <br/>Yes. <br/>Oh, my God. Let me wear it. <br/>This is... The green is a lot. <br/>It's cool that Bob went on the experience, but he chose Kenny and Crystal,  which was so annoying and frustrating to me because those two just... I don't  know. I'm having a hard time with those two still. <br/>I can feel it, Matty, that you're, like, mad at me. So, I don't know why you're trying to hide it. <br/>I never voted for you. You said we were going to the end together, Kenny. <br/>There's no reason to be upset. <br/>I have good reason. My name was written down three times here. <br/>My name's been written down eight, one of them by you. You still, to this day, say "Crystal, thank you for not writing my name  down."  My name has been written down seven times already. <br/>I don't care. <br/>Think about that. <br/>Hey, Kenny, don't talk about it anymore, okay, bro? <br/>No, I'm mad. Matty is super paranoid. Ever since his name was written down. It was a strategic move on my part, but... It's a game. People write down names. <br/>Let him be scared. Karma's a bitch in this game. Right now I'm throwing the stink on Matty, so everybody else can smell it and  write his name down. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Because you and Sue are like that. <br/>I am like that with Sue. I like Sue. I like spending time with Sue out here. I don't trust her. <br/>You can look me in the eye and say you don't trust Sue. <br/>I don't trust Sue. <br/>You're lying. <br/>What? <br/>You've changed, and it's not for the good. But if you (blip) me and Kenny over, karma is a bitch. <br/>Why are you getting mad at me? I didn't do anything. <br/>Because me and Kenny have been there for you from day one. <br/>What do you mean? What do you want from me? <br/>I don't want anything from you. I don't want anything from you. <br/>I have no idea what's happening right now. Crystal is going off on Matty for no reason, and I've already seen Kenny go  off on Matty, and Matty doesn't deserve to be yelled at. <br/>What am I doing wrong, Crystal? <br/>Keep doing what you're doing. But where did this come from? <br/>Matty is right, I think, that Crystal and Kenny have been in this together  from the beginning and they just take out whoever they want. Kenny acts like he's this weak, little meager guy, and he spins all these  lies, and Crystal is just a big bully. This is the thing. They're not good people. I'm starting to see that about Kenny, and I know that about Crystal. <br/>Do you really, or you just... I don't know what's going on. <br/>I don't, either, but now I see that they're not, like... Why would they kick  you when you're down? It feels like they're just going off on you when you know you're going. But you're not going. <br/>Why don't I just...  You're not going to go. Okay? <br/>Well, what do we do? <br/>You, me, Bob, and Sue. I have to talk to Bob because I know Bob better than anybody else. At this point. <br/>Sugar, are you truthful? <br/>I am not...  If Sugar really is telling me the truth, I have hope, and I could play this  game. I might have to go to the end with Bob, and Bob will dominate, but least good  will prevail. <br/>It's either me and you guys or you guys and Sue. <br/>Who do we take out first, then, if you're being serious? <br/>Crystal. Crystal goes first. <br/>This is just intense. I'm just praying that I can find the strength to... finish. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. We'll now bring in Susie, returning from Exile Island. <br/>It was a good time. It was a good time. <br/>Probst: Welcome back. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: First things first. Bob, I will take back the necklace. Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, on my "go," you will study the features of a  Gabonese mask. You will then grab a bag of mask pieces and make your way through a series of  obstacles to a station where you will find a second blank mask. You will then use those pieces to fill in the missing features. One more thing: you will be blindfolded. First person to collect all three bags and successfully recreate the mask  wins immunity-- guaranteed a one in what, Kenny? <br/>One in five chance of winning a million dollars. <br/>Probst: There you go. Losers, Tribal Council, where somebody will be voted out of this game. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes. All right, we'll get started. Here we go. Other side, Sugar, other side. Here we go. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! You will use your hands to study that mask. Or, if you decide to, you can head out right away. It is up to you. Matty quickly out to a lead. Matty at his station first, got his first bag, and he's heading back. Not going to work on it one bag at a time. Kenny back with his first bag of pieces. Bob is back. Sugar, Bob, Kenny are all going to start working on recreating the mask. Matty's going to go get all of his pieces at once. Crystal. <br/>Yes? <br/>Probst: You are off the course. <br/>Oh, shoot. <br/>Probst: You are in the wrong lane. You're completely off track. You got to get back on the course and find your lane. Matty coming back with his second bag of pieces, while Kenny, Bob, Sugar, and  Susie start working with their first bag of facial features. Crystal, up over a hitching post, heading the right way. In the wrong lane. Matty heading back for his third and final bag. Bob is heading back, looking for his second bag. Crystal once again off the course. Crystal back on the course. Matty coming back with that third bag. Everybody else so close and yet so far away when you cannot see. Matty now back with all three bags of the facial features. Matty now going to start working on his mask. Kenny heading back now, looking for that second bag. Bob is back with his second bag. Crystal, miraculously, is almost there. Crystal has arrived with her first bag. Kenny takes a header into a pole. Even the king can get injured in this challenge. Everybody working on their mask now. Bob now heading back for his third and final bag. Susie heading back for her second bag. (Bob groans, chuckles) Bob took a header into a station. Susie is off the course. Bob heading back with that third and final bag. Matty going to head back to check his mask again, while Bob is back with that  third and final bag. <br/>I think I have it. <br/>Probst: Bob thinks he has it. Bob does not have it. Matty now coming back after checking that mask. Bob making a lot of changes. Kenny still working on his mask. He has all three bags. The question now is, "Do I have the right pieces?" Crystal not  giving up, continues to fight in this challenge. Susie trying to find the course. <br/>I think I have it, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Kenny thinks he has it. Kenny is wrong. Kenny going to head back to check his mask again. Matty very close. Bob is almost there. Big immunity on the line. <br/>I'll just try that. <br/>Probst: Bob thinks he has it. Bob is right! Bob wins immunity! Four straight challenges. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: Bob, come on over. Once again, immunity is yours. Turn around, brother. Once again, Bob is safe at Tribal Council. After 36 long days, Tribal Council tonight. One of you will be going home. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. <br/>Four challenges in a row. I'm 57 years old. It felt real good. Been a good run at four. I never would have guessed that. <br/>Bob promised me that if he won the immunity necklace that he'll give it to me. Now, it's up to Bob, you know. Actions do speak louder than words, and I can only wait to see what he does  tonight. <br/>I know you want to get rid of Matty. But we get rid of Matty tonight, there's a chance Bob lied to me and won't  give me the necklace next time. So I'm going to tell Bob to give me the necklace tonight. And we got to vote for Bob. <br/>Okay, sounds good. <br/>Is that okay? <br/>I'm cool with that. <br/>Who would've thought Bob would be winning all these challenges? But he has been. We should have got rid of him when we had the chance, but we kept him in  because everybody hated Randy. And now we're paying for it. He's too dangerous at this point. None of us has the chance to make it to the final three. <br/>Okay. In all honesty, I would like to take out Matty, but if it's Bob's name we're  going with tonight, Bob it is. As long as it's not Crystal, I'm fine. <br/>Hmm? Why? Why would you be scared? <br/>I don't know. Bob made a deal with me, you know. He's going to give me that immunity necklace if he wins. If he doesn't, he'll look really bad in front of everybody. If he does, he'll look good in front of everybody, and he'll go home. So lose-lose situation for him. <br/>Why would they blindside you? We're going to take Matty out. Why would you feel nervous? <br/>'Cause I'm with you. There might be the four still. <br/>Okay, okay. We'll talk... we'll talk. We'll talk about it. Let's find out who's voting for who? <br/>What? <br/>Hey, guys. <br/>Kenny has come up with this elaborate plan to hoax Bob out of his necklace. If Bob were to give Kenny the necklace, then everybody would vote for Bob  because they want to keep their five alliance. I don't want to be aligned with all those guys. I want to be aligned with the good guys. Crystal and Kenny, I've been, like, in an alliance with them. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>But just something, something is really striking me weird right now that,  that I didn't feel before. And, um, they told me that if you give Kenny the, uh, the necklace, then he's  going to... they're going to blindside you. That's the plan. And, uh, see, I wouldn't know that unless they told me that. So... I think that you shouldn't do everything that they say. I think we need to take them out. I mean, I just wanted to talk to you about it. You don't have to make any decisions. You can vote for whoever you want. <br/>So where's Susie stand in all this? <br/>I-I really don't know what Susie's doing. I'm sure she's going to vote for whoever Matty votes for. And I think we should vote for Crystal. <br/>Sugar said to me that it was a blindside coming, which is an interesting  thing because she hasn't done anything to show me I can trust her. She has not done anything that shows me I can't trust her. So I want to believe, but she's, um, she-she's playing the game. <br/>I appreciate that. Um...  I mean, it's-it's a big decision for you, and I understand that. But I just want you to look out for yourself. I will not vote for you. I know you're the biggest threat, but I don't care. I just think the good guys should win in the end. <br/>What are we going to do if he doesn't give me the idol? <br/>I'm going home, obviously. <br/>Hmm? <br/>I think he might do it. <br/>Why? What happened? <br/>I just talked to him for a little bit, and I was like... I hate lying to Bob  because I really, really like Bob. But it is a game. I just told him that Kenny's next. I think. We'll see. <br/>Bob thinks that I'm on the outskirts with him, and, um, I've made him think  that. Hopefully, he will give me that immunity necklace, and Bob goes home tonight. But if not, then Matty will be going home instead. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm definitely playing my idol at Tribal because it's my last day to do it. Maybe I should give it to Matty and save Matty, but I don't want anybody to  blindside me. Just as long as Matty listens to me, and Bob knows to trust me, everything's  going to be fine. <br/>Probst: Now bring in the members of our jury. Marcus, Charlie, Randy... and Corinne, voted out at the last Tribal Council. So, Bob, let's start with you. Four challenges in a row. There's no hiding; you're a legitimate threat in this game. <br/>You hit the nail right on the head. It's a huge target on my back. And if I don't win, I could be joining the jury. <br/>Probst: Kenny, you start seeing a guy like Bob bring it on strong, he could  win his way to the final Tribal Council. <br/>Yeah, he amazes me, you know, for being as old as he is. He's strong. He's smart. He's agile. He's, he's Bob. <br/>Probst: Matty, when you see Bob win challenge after challenge, what starts  going through your head? <br/>You know, if anybody is going to dominate at this game, I'm really happy that  it's this man next to me, Bob, because it's a lot better him having that  necklace around his neck than somebody of a little less caliber. <br/>Probst: Susie, a lot going on these last few days. Hard to be away on Exile? <br/>Yeah, when you're away like that and you come back into the game, it's like,  wow. You just miss bits and pieces. And then I have to rely on my own gut instincts, so... Even now, I'm still  not certain. <br/>Probst: Kenny, with only six people left, why do you think Bob chose you as  one of the people to go on the gorilla reward? <br/>Um, basically, at the last Tribal Council, uh, I-I flopped. I believed in Bob, and once I got back to camp, everybody noticed that I was  the one who flopped. And I was very frustrated, and I asked him, "Why did you lie to me,  Bob?" And Bob promised me something. He-he told me that he would try his best to win the next immunity challenge,  and he would give me the immunity necklace if he did win it. <br/>Probst: Bob, is that true? <br/>That's-that's what I told him. Uh, we have since then sort of renegotiated things. Uh, I told him that if I feel that he is going to go home tonight, that I'd  give him the necklace. And after we discuss all this, I'll make that decision. <br/>Probst: And, Kenny, you're making the case tonight that you feel you're in  danger. <br/>I was at such a great position, and now I'm on the outcast. You know, I turned on my alliance. Bob has the necklace, and where am I? <br/>Probst: Crystal, got to make you feel a little good that Bob, who clearly has  some power in this game, picked you as one of the people to go on a big  reward. <br/>Um, I feel that he chose me because I haven't been on a reward in the 36 days  that we've been here. And I feel honored to at least get some kind of culture from being here in  Africa. <br/>Probst: Matty, do you think that's all it was... Bob just wanted somebody to  have a cultural experience, nothing to do with an opportunity to bond with  two people who could help you get further in the game? <br/>I believe Bob knows that Kenny and Crystal are the tightest alliance since  day one in this game, and they have honestly dominated this game. <br/>Probst: Kenny, you're shaking your head. <br/>I think that everybody thinks that me and Crystal are very tight, but I  jumped from my really good position in the five alliance that I had, and I  feel like I could be the next to go. <br/>Probst: So, based on what you're saying then, how much more important is the  deal you may or may not have made with Bob tonight? <br/>It makes the deal even more important to me because I've had a feeling all  day that it might be me. <br/>Probst: Matty, how you feeling tonight? <br/>Uh, very vulnerable. And, uh, I don't have that necklace on me, so that puts me on the chopping  block next. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about the hidden immunity idol. I just want to remind everybody that tonight is the last night you can play...   The hidden immunity idol? (Sugar laughs)  Probst: You're claiming that's a hidden immunity idol? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: I guess if you play it, we'll find out that if it is. Wouldn't be the first time somebody's played an idol that wasn't the idol. (Sugar laughs)  I didn't make that one. (Bob chuckles)  Probst: Bob, it's time to vote. You have the individual immunity necklace. You can keep it for yourself. You can give it to somebody else, including Kenny, if you want to. It is up to you. <br/>I told Kenny if I thought he was going home tonight, I would give it to him. And... I'm going to keep it because I don't think he's going home tonight. <br/>Probst: All right, so, you cannot vote for Bob. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Crystal, you're up. <br/>You were once part of my alliance. You wrote my name down one time, and it's time for me to pay you back. <br/>Crystal, I've been waiting for this day for a long time, and I'm very happy  that it's finally arrived. <br/>Dude, you don't know how to talk or deal with people. So, good luck with that jury over there. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. <br/>Probst: Thank you. The rules of Survivor state that if somebody plays a hidden immunity idol,  then any votes cast against that person will not count. The person with the next highest number of votes will be voted out. This is indeed the hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Matty will not count. I'll now read the votes. First vote: Matty. Does not count. Matty. Does not count. Next vote: Crystal. One vote for Crystal. Crystal. Two votes Crystal. 13th person voted out and the fifth member of our jury: Crystal. That's three votes. That's enough. Need to bring me your torch. Crystal, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Probst: Well, we are down to five. The million dollars is within sight. The question is, which one of the five of you will win it. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Good night.

That would fool me. <br/>Probst: ...switches... Drop your buffs. <br/>What?! <br/>Probst: ...and more surprises than ever before. <br/>New tribes. <br/>Probst: Find out in a special two-hour season finale, where one of these five  people will become the sole Survivor. <br/>Wow. I did not know that Sugar turned on me. I don't know what for. It kind of hurts with three days left in the game, but when I yelled at  Matty, I don't think it helped. It's been a great run, 36 days. Tried to play a fair game, and hopefully I made my friends and family proud.
