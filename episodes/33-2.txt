<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor": At the  millennial tribe, Figgy flirted with the men. <br/>The triforce. <br/>Jeff: And put together an alliance of four, put tribes was  catching on. <br/>Figgy's running the show. <br/>We need to tear apart that popular group. <br/>Jeff: At the gen-x tribe, David was scared of everything. <br/>There are girls with more testosterone back at that camp  than he's got. <br/>Jeff: While majority alliance came together. <br/>It's either Rachel or David. <br/>I have six people. I think we're in good shape. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, David pled his case. <br/>I don't want to go home  tonight. <br/>Jeff: In the end, he was spared, and Rachel was sent home. Rachel, the tribe has spoKen. 19 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/> It sparks but it doesn't light. <br/>It's embarrassing. <br/>Here we are on day five, and we still don't have fire. Other than that, everything is going ahead as planned. I have a six-person alliance. And I’m going to say it like it is-- for CeCe and David, they  tonight have a chance. CeCe aligned herself with Rachel which was a kiss of death. <br/>When you get tired I'll take a whack at it. <br/>Go for it. <br/>For David, he can't handle it out here. <br/>All right, David! <br/>No pressure. <br/>Yeah. Right now, I think I’m playing a miserable can "Survivor"  game, so I want to be a hero for my tribe and bring them fire because I’m so  grateful for them sparing me last night at tribal. I'm not giving up. I really need to prove myself today and it's in the line with  the the gen-x attitude, never give up. I'm more of a cochran hannan ozzy. Why does this fire hate us so much? <br/>Come on, dave. <br/>Keep going, keep going. <br/>I think I got something,  guys. <br/>Blow, baby! <br/>You are reborn, my friend. Don't smother it. Don't smother it. <br/>Nice, nice! <br/>That is awesome, dude. Well, good work, dave, you did it, man. <br/>Oddly enough, dave, out of all of us got a flame going. <br/>Where the the hell has this kid been? <br/>Good job, dave. <br/>Can you break that in half for me. <br/>He's still going home next. Dave is probably weakest challenge person we have. <br/>I'll have to cut it. <br/>He's like our puppy dog right now. We're trying to keep petting him until we get rid of him. <br/>What do you think, if I collect big rocks that we can,  like, sit on around this? <br/>Or just keeping him busy. If you let him get in his own head, that's when he goes nuts and  starts looking for idol idols and getting all paranoid. <br/>Of course, not. Of course not. I would love an idol, but contribute to the tribe first, and  while doing that, just kind of be looking around, because looking for rocks  and looking for the idol, they both make you dirty. So this is-- this is an an alibi. Chair one. <br/>That isa boy. <br/>I guess not. <br/>Whoa! Ants and spiders. <br/>Another big rock. <br/>One more. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's in here, isn't it? Oh, my God. I just got to split this pope holy-- holy crap. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Get out of there! Yes! Oh, my God. This is why we come to play "Survivor."  "Congratulations. You have found the hidden immunity idol. If you use the idol and... "Yeah, same old rules. And now I have the hidden immunity idol. I never, ever thought this was going to happen for me,  especially, on the nade year I’m on and now I’m at a zenith. This is so perfect. This is can exactly what I mean to have the confidence to make  big, strategic moves right now. This is, like, serendipty. <br/>I'll probably never leave the west coast. <br/>I feel like if I move,  I'll never go back east. <br/>Let's move to l.A. <br/>Okay, done. <br/>I really like figs. She's super rad, easy to be around. I mean, she's really beautiful. And it's just like love goggles. And fig is directly in front of me. <br/>It's like taking shots before-- a game of hockey or  something. <br/>I didn't come here for  romance, but oh, my God. Those blue eyes, they are dangerous. <br/>Getting pretty good at this. <br/>Waaa! They are just gorgeous. They are so beautiful. And I get to cuddle up with that. I'm just like, that's fine. <br/>The middle of the night I hear a kiss sound, and I was  like y'all can't be for real. You stink. Your mouth is naflty. You got sand in your drawers, and you kissing somebody. That's disgusting! <br/>I heard y'all kissing. <br/>You kissed her last night. <br/>Smile if you kissed her. <br/>My dude kissed her already. Whaaa! <br/>Me and figs got called out, and I look at that as a risky  move. But millennials are dreamers, and I’m dreaming big. <br/>She said that? <br/>Yeah. I was just like--  You guys are so pretty! <br/>My tribe doesn't even consider Taylor and myself being a  power couple threat. Maybe it's because we're millennials. Only people-- cough, cough, Michaela-- are going to throw it out  there to try to put a target on our backs. But nobody cares. <br/>They keep isolating themselves. Do you see them snuggling up. <br/>I think the millennial  generation takes hook-ups a lot less seriously than maybe the gen-xers do. And I think it's that casual attitude that might be getting Taylor  and figger in trouble. You also have to have the attitude that you're playing "Survivor"  and I think they miss that part. <br/>They're on top of each other. <br/>They're way too close. <br/>It's not good. <br/>Love in paradise. <br/>Figgy and Taylor are freaking stupid, man. No couple ever lasts on "Survivor." ever. Me and michele are still in an alliance with them, and this  powerful couple can destroy everything we created. Taylor is my boy. I love that kid. But sometimes women blind you, and then you end up stuck with a  woman and you're bailing on your boys when it's bowling night and you're  stuck at home with your girlfriend. You're a dork. Like wake up. I'm going to tell you this because I’m your boy. Power couples don't last. Imagine something goes down. What will happen. <br/>We'll get picked off. <br/>Yeah, and I’m not losing $1 million. I need that and I know you need that. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You want to snowboard and chill. <br/>I thought it all the way  through. That's how I’m going to play this game. <br/>Taylor is so oblivious to the fact that, dude, it's not  going to work because he's so infatuated with Figgy. But this power couple is like a bull's eye for a nuclear  missile. That's how big it is. This is where we need to blow up because this is not good. This is where we need to blow up because this is not good. Âª âª  We got some dinner. Spear fishing and surviving in this kind of environment is  something I've always done my entire life and something I’m good at. But in a social game like this, you have to develop connections  and bonds, and I’m socially shy sometimes, man. It's something that's plagued me my entire life. <br/>What did you get? Octopus? Nice, man! Awesome score! <br/>This is octopus prime. <br/>Octopus prime. <br/>Dinner. I was the can kid with the speech impediment and nervous  twitches so David and I are kind of mirrors of each other. Socially, we're a little bit awkward, a little bit shy. <br/>What do I cowith this? Oh, no. <br/>As I see him opening up it inspires me to open up. <br/>It's hard to know exactly what the divisions are. <br/>I see it as Paul's posse. <br/>It is, yeah, Paul's posse. <br/>Are you cool enough to be let in the group. That's kind of how it feels. There are two things you and I can do, stay where we're at at  the bottom and wait to get picked off or--  Decide to make a move of some kind. <br/>Decide to make a move and break up the alliance. Right now it's Paul's party. Whatever we can do to stay strong, the two of us. <br/>Ken and I, we are on opposite sides of the science  spectrum. I don't look like-- anything like Ken. He's built like a super athlete. He looks like an adonis. Yeah, what girl wouldn't want to date him? You know. A girl doesn't really want to date a neurotic bald guy. But I like condition a lot. I like Ken a lot. And in "Survivor" you need at least one person you can  trust. And for Ken it's me. It has instructions and everything, and this is it. You're it for me as far as trust. Please, don't tell anyone. <br/>No, we're golden. We're brothers. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I believe in dave's and  I's alliance. It's real. It's legit. Dave has an idol. I think we'll be using that to band together and do something  big. For us to move forward, Paul's got to go. We're ready for a fight and I don't want to give Paul too much  time to come in and try to counter. [ laughter ]  Come on! Âª âª  Oh! Am I making progress on this thing? <br/>You're making progress. <br/>Okay. <br/>It's day six, and the millennials' moral is good, but we  didn't realize playing this game would be so hard. As millennials, we grew up with a television screen in front of  our faces, and it's not reality. <br/>Bring it down hard. <br/>Whoa! You all right? <br/>Yeah, I’m good. <br/>But nothing that you experience on a television screen can  carry the same weight as experiencing it in real life. And it is surreal, man. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>There you go! Did you it! <br/>I did it! <br/>Let's mack a surf board. We need a piece of wood. <br/>You're supposed to make me a comb. You made me a bracelet. <br/>Figgy has been a flirt since the boat come up to Fiji. Like, this girl is dumb. You're supposed to kind of blend in at the beginning, and work  your magic behind the scenes, but her magic is trying to be all over the  place. It's not magic. You need to pull the bunny out of the hat. You can't just walk in with the bunny. The problem is it's hard it to act like I don't know what's  going on. If I have something to say and I’m not saying it, my mouth will  close but my eyebrows and this face will talk. <br/>You're making me nervous with that machete. <br/>Don't worry. It wouldn't be aimed at you. <br/>What was that? <br/>Oh, my God, dude! <br/>Oh. <br/> I’m getting hit by a  machete. <br/>That's good. <br/>That's good, yeah. Me. <br/>Why? What did you do? <br/>I’m trying to figure that  out. <br/>You got some good amnes agirl. It's only been six days. <br/>I know, but why are you  being phony when you want to keep it real. <br/>Why am I being phony? <br/>Yeah, I’m trying to get to know you--  You need to be quiet. <br/>Okay, just keep eating that sugar cane. <br/>I will. It's delicious. <br/>Okay. Michaela is being a complete bitch about nothing. I want her as far as away from me. <br/>Now I’m having fun. <br/>Literally, Figgy has put herself in the crosshairs. Basic laws of "Survivor" will tell you, don't come  blazing out of the gate. Don't get into a catfight, and sure as hell, don't get yourself  into a showmance! <br/>I got this! <br/>We're good. <br/>Any firewood you see, that's going to be our next problem. <br/>Okay. <br/>Anybody walking that sees any dry drifted wood that you  can physically carry, bring it. <br/>All right. Will do. <br/>With me, it's very simple. When it comes to taking control of the game, I 100% want to be  in control. That's where I have to be. I don't have a choice. I breathe control. <br/>It's the Paul show in his eyes. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And nobody else matters. I don't think he's looking out for anybody else. We're on the outside. You, me, and dave are on the outside for sure. And I’m not okay with that. <br/>Yeah, I’m not okay with that, either. <br/>52-year-old legs. <br/>So I’m curious of your thoughts? <br/>Cut off the head. That was my first thought. You gotta get him out. <br/>What's the head? <br/>Paul. <br/>Exactly. Something with guys like Paul, when you ego is big like that. <br/>You need to feed it. <br/>Massaga and he begins to feel invensible. <br/>And they make mistakes. <br/>They begin to feel like nothing can touch them. <br/>Do you want some more water? <br/>Give me a second. <br/>I think with this move we  can move from the bottom of this tribe to the top in this game. <br/>That would be so great. I'm with it. <br/>Paul's down. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Rise up a little bit. <br/>Aah. <br/>That's all right, buddy. We got you. <br/>I got you. Just lean back. <br/>It's all right, bud. <br/>Keep drinking. <br/>You want to lay down? <br/>Yeah. <br/>We got it. <br/>I’m scared. <br/>I know you're scared. <br/>I’m scared. <br/>I want to you focus on  the breathing right now. You're in good hand right now. The doctors will be here short he. <br/>My chest. <br/>Breathe. <br/>Hey, you gotta breathe, buddy. Breathe! <br/>I’m trying, I’m trying. <br/>Breathe, Paul! Deep breaths. <br/>You're doing good, buddy. <br/>Coming up now. They're coming up to help. <br/>Back up. <br/>The main thing at the moment? <br/>My hand being numb. <br/>Both hands? <br/>Right to my elbows. Ooik, like, super tight. <br/>Are you still feeling dizzy? <br/>And the cramps. <br/>Okay. <br/>Nice, deep breaths. In between your cramps, you need to get as much of that water  down. Nice little sips. <br/>Jeff: We have the chopper coming in. Give us an update. <br/>It will warn us if there are signs he might have had a  heart attack. <br/>I’m not going to lie, I’m  a little scared. I have never gone down like this. I'm not in control, you know. I'm always in control. <br/>Try to relax a little. <br/>It's extremely scary, to see him go down makes you think,  okay, if that can happen to him, it can happen to anybody. And I really, really need Paul to stay in the game, huge key  part of our alliance. But beyond that, I just care about him. <br/>It's just coming through now. <br/>Jeff: Okay. <br/>And it looks like there's no sign of any damage to your  heart there, Paul, okay. <br/>Thank God. <br/>Jeff: You're all right, you're all right! <br/>The story fit with the diagnosis. Early heat exhaustion, and a bit of dehydration, which has now  settled. <br/>Jeff: Here's what we're going to do, dr. Joe, you're comfortable. We're sending the chopper back. No need for that. All right. Game is back on. <br/>Thanks, doc. Thanks, guys. Thanks. <br/>I feel so guilty saying  this, and I’m glad Paul didn't have a heart attack, but honestly, when he  went down, I thought this might be a good thing per me. Because he's the one I want to vote out. And he's really calling all the shots, and being so weak right  now, that's going to make it easier to convince people that, you know, what? It might be time to get rid of Paul. <br/>Feeling any better? <br/>Yes. Âª âª  Jeff: All right! Millennials getting your first look at the new gen-x tribe, Rachel  voted out at the first tribal council. <br/>Sounds about right. <br/>Jeff: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/> Yeah! <br/>Jeff: First things first. I need that idol back, so, millennials, you can swim it over to  me. Thank you, sir. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, one person from each tribe is going to  dive in the water, race up the cargo net, leap off the platform, and retrieve  a key. Then the next person goes. Once you've retrieved all five keys, you'll use them to open a  chest containing a mask. Use that mask to dive down and retrieve five rings. You'll then attempt to land those rings on a series of targets. The first tribe to finish wins immunity, safe from the vote. In addition, you are playing for reward. Want to know what you're playing? Playing? For? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Winning tribe get a tap. Millennials, you have one extra person. You're going to set somebody out. Who is it going to be? <br/>I'll sit out. I'll sit out. <br/>Jeff: Hannah, you'll be with me. Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize and we'll get  started. All right, here we go. For immunity and reward. Survivors ready? Go! It's Chris and Michelle out of the gate. Chris is ripping through the water. Gets to the platform first. He's up the cargo net. And he's got a key! Michelle jumps. She's got a key! You gotta get all the way to your platform, and your key on your  stand, before the next person can go. Go, gen-x! Go, millennials! It is Paul in the water and will in the water. Paul get through the water very quickly. Will right on his tail. <br/>Go, will! <br/>Jeff: Paul get a key! Will gets a key! We are still dead even. You gotta get that key on the stand. Go, gen-x! Go, millennials! It's Sunday in the water for gen-x and Michaela in the water for  millennials. Three keys left. Sunday moving quickly. She's already up the cargo net. Michaela right on her tail! Sunday just misses. Michaela get it. Gotta get it on there. Go, gen-x! Go, millennials! It's David in the water. And Zeke. Zeke is now passes David. Millennials now in the lead. Zeke is killing it! David struggling on the cargo net. Challenge proving very difficult for David. <br/>Come on, dave! <br/>Jeff: Taking a lot of time! And he's got it! Zeke extending the lead for the millennials. Go, Adam! David really struggling in the water. Giving a huge lead to the millennials. Adam as a key for the millennials. <br/>Jeff, gen-x! Jessica now in the water for gen-x. You're good! Millennials now opening their chest. <br/>Thatta girl! <br/>Jeff: Jessica got her key. Jessica needs to make up a lot of time for gen-x. <br/>Yeah, yeah! <br/>Jeff: Figgy has the chest open. She has the mask. Jessica now back. Go, gen-x! Figgy is going to go first. Figgy has the first ring. <br/> Let's go! <br/>Jeff: Fred has the mask. It's going to be cease net water first for gen-x. Lawyer it is now Jay in the water for the millennials. CeCe can't get a ring. She's coming back. That's going to cost gen-x even more time! And now Lucy in the water for gen-x. Jay up with the second ring for the millennials. Go! It's going to be Mari now for the millennials. Lucy finally comes up with that first ring. Bret now in the water for gen-x. And Bret has the second ring. Gen-x is back in this now. Ken putting on the mask. Ken in the water now for gen-x. Mari has been under a long time. And here she is! Mari up with the third ring for the millennials. It is 3-2. Ken up quickly with the third ring for gen-x. We are tied. Taylor going to get in the water for the millennials now. <br/>Ken, go again! <br/>Ken, come on! <br/>Jeff: Taylor back up with the fourth ring for the  millennials. Ken back up with the fourth ring for gen-x. We are neck and neck. Here goes james with a big dive! Bret back tbhawrt for gen-x. Both looking for that fifth and final ring. It is Jay for the millennials and Bret right behind him for  gen-x. Tossing the rings for the millennials, it is Jay. Gotta get five rings total. It is CeCe for gen-x. CeCe has the first ring for gen-x. They're now in the lead! CeCe with the second ring. Jay has the first ring for millennials. Jay with a second ring. <br/>Hurry! <br/>Jeff: They're tied 2-2. Gen-x is back in this. Ken snags the third ring. Gen-x in the the lead. 3-2. The millennials have given up a huge lead, and now trail. Ken with the fourth ring for gen-x! Jay snags the third ring. <br/>Come on, come on, come on! Gen-x down to their last ring. They could win it right here. And he does it! Gen-x wins immunity and reward! Sending millennials to tribal council. All right, gen-x. Who wants to come get immunity? Who wants to come get immunity? Congrats. <br/>Jeff: Immunity for gen-x, no tribal council, nobody going  home. The tarp will be waiting for you back at camp. Enjoy the night off. All right, millennials, got nothing for you except a date with  me tonight at tribal council where somebody will be the second person voted  out of this game. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>Tonight we want Figgy to be really comfortable and we want  to blinded side her without even knowing. When I beat an opponent in a video game, it feels great, but  this is a person's dreams we're crushing and this is what I think makes  "Survivor" real. Âª âª  We lost today's immunity challenge, but, you know, I’m a  little bit tickled to be going to tribal council. I came to vote people out, and I came to win $1 million. And I want to get started. Figgy's in the hot seat right now because wherever Figgy goes,  her little puppy dog Taylor goes. Like, one person is not allowed to have two votes. That's against the spirit of the game. I don't trust Figgy and I think Figgy is a source of the lot of  the consternation. <br/>Her and Taylor are too close. <br/>That's dangerous. <br/>Okay, what are the chances that she's going to see a  blindside coming? <br/>I don't think she will. <br/>I don't think she will,  either. <br/>I’m excited to finally go  to tribal council and get it over with. <br/>Everybody vote Figgy. The couple would be dangerous if Figgy was going to stay around. But I’m just convinced that Figgy's going home. So get your kisses in, because that couple is about to go back  down to one real quick. <br/>Now? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Fig segoing home. And it sucks because I had figy and Taylor in the trifecta,  okay. And we were going to make things happen. <br/>But, hopefully, Figgy being gone will bring Michaela into  the group. If she doesn't, I think--  Next. <br/>Yeah,. <br/>I’m okay with that. Unless something happens and things go crazy, which they usually  do, my alliance is gone. <br/>I’m just upset. <br/>What are you upset about? <br/>They want fig out first. <br/>But you realize what we're losing numbers if we vote out Figgy. It doesn't make sense to get rid of Figgy right now. My alliance with Jay, Figgy, and Taylor, we gotta keep that  number. And we wee gotta switch the vote. I say we take out Mari nuls have a better idea. <br/>I’m fine with it. <br/>Marr sereally dangerous because she's smart, but tonight's  tribal council is. Keeping people who I know will stick with me moving forward. We need Figgy and Michaela to kiss and make up. If possible, because we need Michaela's vote. <br/>Figgy, you, and me. <br/>We need six votes. <br/>I want to tell you both,  I like both of you. Zeke told me they want you gone first. <br/>Wait, what? <br/>First we take out Figgy because she's the one running the  show. That's what he said. Second, we take out Michaela, because that's an easy vote. <br/>My name is on chopping block. It's like hitting you in the chest, you know, with a knife. Michaela and I definitely have had our differences, but she has  to stick with us. There's nothing else to it. I don't want this, Michaela. I want to work with you. I don't know where this came from. I don't know what I did. I really don't. <br/>Really? This girl is trying to be my friend now. Figgy was going home, and I was perfectly fine with that. But if Jay's telling the truth, I could definitely be in  trouble. So this whole thing is up in the air. <br/>What we have to do is we have to keep six strong. <br/>So who are these six. <br/>One, two, three, Michelle, will, and tails. <br/>We need will. <br/>We both know what Figgy's up to, like, and what she's  capable of. <br/>Figgy is the kind of person if you give her a little bit  of momentum, she will go all the way to end. I've seen parvity do it, I've seen john cochran do it. Who do you want gone? <br/>Mari! <br/>She's a strategic player and she's really strong. <br/>This is nerve-racking, changing the plan, like, hours  before. <br/>I know, but Figgy, if we  need to, is an easy vote later. <br/>I see what you're saying,  you have a loof very good point, but it makes me nervous. <br/>This for tribal council is going to draw a line. Figgy can't go tonight. It has to be someone else. It's scary to me because I’m not sure we have the numbers to  really, truly save Figgy. So I might have to try to pull strings at tribal council to make  sure I have the the numbers and get what I want. Make sure I have the the numbers and get what I want. <br/>Jeff: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch, dip it in, and get fire. This is part of the ritual at tribal council because in this  game, fire represents your life. When your fire's gone, so are you. So, Adam, let's talk about this look on your face. [ laughter ] we haven't even started. <br/>First of all, this place is unbelievable. <br/>It's beautiful. <br/>I feel like I’m inside my  television right now. I'm in front of Jeff probst, and it's a terrible night, right. Like, this sucks. <br/>Jeff: Mari, one of the raps on the millennials is that  because of technology, you don't call anymore. You break up over texts. Does that make a millennial better at social dynamics? <br/>My world is a two-dimensional world. I would play a game in my monitor like this, where, easy. But to do it with real-life people. It's a completely different thing. I think it's empathy and emotion. When you see people's eyeballs and you see their soul through  them, you get to know these people and start to care about them. <br/>Jeff: Zeke, does it surprise you that you're out here, and  you've made a shelter. You have fire. <br/>Oh, my God! I'm, like, living in a dream world. Like, I started fire without flint. Like, skews me? This is the adventure of a lifetime. And I feel like I’m my best version of myself out here because I  want to give all of myself out here. Because, like, everything about this experience is incredible. <br/>Jeff: Michaela, very interesting what Zeke just said, that  because of the experience, it makes you want to give your best self. Do you feel that? <br/>No, not necessarily. I feel like the situations you're in here can bring out the  worst things. <br/>Jeff: Wow, so everything's not rosy. <br/>Nooo..., not for me the at least. <br/>Jeff: Adam, are you surprised that Michaela is so  forthcoming? <br/>I mean, I get Michaela,  right. She's a straight shooter. That's a great quality to have as a person, but that's a tough  trait to have on day one in the game of "Survivor."  But it is my natural reaction to observe, and I saw a the  lot of things. I saw little groups for me. Little whispers in the middle of the night. People act like just because I wasn't in the circle, I couldn't  influence any circles. <br/>Jeff: Wow. Game is clearly on at camp millennial. So, Hannah, we talked about who feels like they're on the  outside. Who did you notice instantly bonding? <br/>Yeah, we all cuddle for warmth in the shelter. Some people like cuddling a little more than other people. I don't blame them. They're both very pret gle who are we talking about, Hannah? <br/>I’m talking about Taylor  and Figgy. <br/>I have no idea what she's  talking about. <br/>If the shelter's a-rockin' don't come a-knocKen. <br/>Jeff: So, Taylor, this is out in the season. <br/>We got called out mackin 'in the shack. <br/>Jeff: So you guys are full-on making out. <br/>No. <br/>I second whatever she  said, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: You're learning! But, will, it is complicated. There's an assumption that these two will be voting together. And that's two votes. <br/>Yeah, when you're cuddling in the shelter and maybe or  maybe not making out with each other, there is definitely an assumption that  the two of them are working together. <br/>Jeff: Zeke, what's your take? Does this tribe mind that they're together? <br/>It's definitely not good. Figgy's always going to be a little bit more loyal to Taylor  than she would be loyal to me, right? <br/>No, it's just funny at this point because we all kind of  kid around at camp about it. <br/>I think we're early  enough to where it shouldn't be a concern in this tribe. <br/>Seriously, yeah. <br/>Jeff: Michaela, that got a reaction from you. <br/>Yeah. I'm not stupid. It's, like, they're telling you, "I think you're so dumb  they can lie straight to your face and you're not going to find  out."  Jeff: Wow. So, Michaela, there's clearly animosity. <br/>Not to the tribe. It flutters with, like, a particular person. <br/>Jeff: Who is the particular person? <br/>The one in the middle, miss cuddle-shack. <br/>What? What about me? <br/>See how she played dumb? <br/>No I was listening to a conversation. Are we doing this again? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay. It's okay. <br/>Peanut gallery over there, man. <br/>Jeff: Wow! I'm fascinating with this. Jay, there's another entire conversation happening between Michelle  and Hannah. <br/>This is not a surprise at all. Okay? Everyone is young, energetic, and paranoid to the point where  it's just, like, too much. <br/>Jeff: So, Hannah. <br/>Yeah! I don't know. I'm dizzy. I feel like the more I’m out here the more I just-- I’m sorry. You're Jeff probst and we're at tribal council. It's all very confuse glg did I misan entire conversation? <br/>Yeah. I'm just giving you an answer you didn't ask for. [ laughter ]  Jeff: Michelle, let's talk about the vote. Because we have a love affair and we have a war, and then we  have 10 people playing a game they love. <br/>Yeah, I think you're making a good point, that we're all  trying to play a game where we're thinking forward. I also think Figgy is in the middle of a couple of things that  are not good for the tribe. And so if I I were Figgy, I might be scared. <br/>Jeff: Figgy, when you hear your name come up openly with Taylor,  and openly with Michaela, are you feeling a little more uncertain? <br/>A little bit. But my mind's at peace right now. And I feel good. <br/>Jeff: Zeke, seconds away from voting, these three are  still talking. <br/>I’m curious what's going  on. <br/>I’m curious what's going  on. <br/>I think it's just Hannah  being Hannah. Sure they're talking and, you know, we could be paranoid and  seeing what's going on. But Hannah is just peachy. And whatever she's talking about right now it's probably about  puppies or something. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Will, you're up. Will, you're up. <br/>Darling, you're much too dangerous to stay in this game. <br/>I really, really, really  hope I can trust Michaela. <br/>I really, really, really  hope I can trust Michaela. <br/>Okay. They're getting me to throw my vote, I have to prove my trust  with them. But I don't understand at the moment. Fig, Mari, Michaela. Mari, Mari. Aaahh! I don't understand what's going on. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. <br/>She still hasn't voted. <br/>Okay! <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the vote. <br/>Jeff: If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and want to  play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Figgy. Mari. Figgy. Mari. Two votes Figgy, two votes Mari. Figgy. That's three votes Figgy. Mari. We're tied again. Three votes Figgy, three votes Mari. Mari. That's four votes Mari, three votes Figgy. Mari. That's five votes Mari, three votes Figgy. Second person voted out of "Millennials vs. Gen-x," Mari. That's six. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Jeff: Mari, the tribe has spoKen. Time for you to go. <br/>Salty. <br/>Well done. <br/>Jeff: Well, it's very clear that the enthusiasm on this  tribe is overshadowed only by the level of game play. Gloves are off, and it is on. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Captioning funded by cbs and ford. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. "Survivor":  Zeke and Adam feel betrayed. <br/>I am upset right now. <br/>My first hashtag blindside. <br/>Jeff: But a twist in the game shakes things up. <br/>I want to be a part of  this twist. I want to experience what gen-x has to offer. <br/>One, two, three! <br/>I got ?Iepped from a mile  away. And I never saw it coming. "Survivor" is the toughest game I've ever played  because it pulls on the heart strings, and play with human emotion is  completely different than playing on a 2-d screen. And it hurts, man, that's all I can can say. It hurts.
