<br/> Jeff: Previously on  "Survivor." after 18 days, recent events centered on three people--  NaOnka, she was an angry and vindictive tribemate. <br/>Why are you raising  your voice at me? I can get loud, too. <br/>Jeff: She had a  hidden immunity idol and control of the entire Espada tribe. Naonka and her ally Chase had decided Alina was the next to go. Next thing you know you gonna be walking away and your torch is put out. Marty, before the switch, he was the most powerful and outspoken player on  his tribe. <br/>Do not mess around  with me. I mean, I'm playing this game for real. <br/>Jeff: After the  switch, he was fighting for his life on the La Flor tribe. His biggest enemy was Jane. <br/>At tribal council I  hope Marty goes home. <br/>Jeff: Marty had only  one ally Jill, and one weapon-- a hidden immunity idol, and then there's Sash. Sash had become the puppet master at La Flor. <br/>Who stays in this  game it's about how loyal are you to me. <br/>Jeff: Espada wins  immunity! After La Flor lost the last immunity challenge, Sash convinced Marty to give  up his hidden immunity idol in exchange for more life in the game. <br/>If we lose the next  immunity challenge, I'll give the idol back to you. <br/>Jeff: At tribal  council Marty was amazed Sash kept his word and sent Jill home instead. Jill, the tribe has spoken. Now Marty is left completely alone with no friends and no idol. 12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>The vultures are  definitely circling and it's dead man walking. It's day 19, and I can't believe this game has put me where I'm at right now. Last night sucked. Jill was an incredible player, a great contender, a lover of the game, and  there are some people left I think have no right to be in this game. So having no Jill, no idol, is total exposure. I don't want to be the next person to go from "Survivor." I just  have to do the best that I can and hang on. <br/>Guys! <br/>What have we got? <br/>Uncle Fabio found  some tree mail! Let's read it first. Let's read it. <br/>I think I see it! <br/>It's like a map. <br/>Who wants to hold the  key? <br/>Oh! <br/>"La flor pack up  all the belongings you will need for the duration of your stay here on the  island and follow this map to your new home." Merge. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>I think I'm going to  cry right now. <br/>Couldn't have been  better news for me as far as I'm concerned. The tribes getting together six on six I think is going to be mostly a La  Flor jockeying around. These guys are going to be wanted to off one of their own for sure. There was division before, NaOnka, and Alina, they could be in trouble. I'm ecstatic, man. I'm back in the saddle again. <br/>One, two, three, La  Flor! <br/>That's a big old chest. <br/>Espada, do not open  this box until you have the key. <br/>They have the key. <br/>Make room at your  camp. Company will be arriving soon. <br/>The merge? <br/>The merge. <br/>Here? <br/>Yeah. <br/>At Espada? <br/>Wow. <br/>Staying here? Get a fire going and wait for them, I guess. <br/>We need to decide  what we're going to do so that we can know what's happening. <br/>I don't know, now  that it's becoming more of an individual game and people are going to start  fending for themselves, I think I need to do the same. Alina, you can see right through her. She burned some bridges early on the in game and she was supposed to go home  next when we were the original La Flor, so she's definitely outlasted her  expected time in this game and I think everybody agrees it's time for her to  go home. <br/>Like, we can get to  final six if the six of us stay strong. If nobody pushes us aside the six of us can totally do it. Marty is still here. Marty will be our biggest threat in the game and that means he has to go  first. <br/>And he has an idol. <br/>And he has an idol so  that means we have to do a major blind-side. As long as he doesn't get individual immunity-- let's make sure that doesn't  happen, guys-- and then we get rid of the head honcho. <br/>Nobody was really on  board with Alina's plan at all, not even uncle Dan. Alina is in this plan by herself the one-woman army, without knowing she's  going to be the first one out if she doesn't get the immunity first. She can be g.I. Jane all she wants but she will be g.I. Jane all by herself with no army, nobody behind her. <br/>Here they are, guys. <br/>Who's gone? <br/>It looks like Jill's  gone? <br/>Who's gone? <br/>Jill. Jill's gone. <br/>We thought that Marty  and Jill were super strong over there. We thought they were, like, running things and it tells us a lot that Jill  was voted out. <br/>This is the company  we were expecting. <br/>Welcome back. <br/>Coming back to camp  was like rebirth. It really felt like home, sweet home. And I felt like the game is starting all over again, and I've been given a  new lease on life. <br/>Should we go see  what's in the chest? <br/>Let's go open the  chest! <br/>All right. <br/>Open it up. [ã    \cheersã    ] Oh, my God! <br/>Bread, bread, bread! <br/>La flor and Espada,  replace your old buffs with these new ones. You have merged. Come up with a new tribe name and begin the next phase of your adventure. Good luck, enjoy the gifts. You have earned them. [ã    \cheersã    ] We made it to the  merge! And we're going to feast! You know, we're merging! Oh! I'm digging the red buffs. <br/>I thought of a name  for the new tribe, "Libertad." which is freedom, liberty. I kind of dig that I got to offer the new name. "Libertad" really resonated for me personally. It means liberty, and in this case, it can also mean freedom, freedom from  everything that's happened up to this point, and it's a new start. <br/>Let's get back to  camp. <br/>Yes, oh, man. We have to drink all of this today! <br/>Everybody grab a  cookie. <br/>Libertad! <br/>When we finally  opened the treasure chest, that food was yummy to my tummy. The salami, I think it just dissolved in my mouth. It was so good. Like my booty? [ã    \fartsã    ] I even snuck some nuts to put in my bra. I was getting it all, honey, all of it. I probably still have some peanuts in my-- in my pocket. <br/>Wow! <br/>Wow! <br/>Yeah, now you'll give  me a hug. Now that we're all fat and happy. <br/>Seeing NaOnka again  was the best because I felt like, wow, she's real, such a relief. I don't know, I don't have to second guess her at all. <br/>She already is. We need to take a walk. <br/>Yeah. <br/>To know that we're  back in the game together feels really good. Keep in mind, only the person that don't have no alliance, so be careful of  her. She's going to be watching you. <br/>Me and NaOnka talked  about everything that happened. She talked about how Alina has been so shady. I don't know, I told her everything that happened on the other side. They treated Jane really bad and I stood up for her. I don't know, everybody over here thought she was hooking up with Marty. <br/>Really? <br/>Including me. I'm not going to lie. Maybe Marty is smart and he's strong but it seemed like he was gunning. <br/>I told her everything. She knows with me it's 100%. So Sash came up with a brilliant idea to ask him for the idol, to give it to Sash. <br/>Does Sash have it? <br/>Sash has the idol. <br/>Oh! Get out of here! <br/>He did it. <br/>Brenda, the one that  was with me and I found the hidden immunity idol, Sash asked Marty for and it  he gave it to him. The sooner we get Alina and Marty out the smoother the game will go. <br/>We'll be able to  knock them out one by one by one by one. <br/>This is going to get  real weird. <br/>This is going to get  wicked. <br/>I'm dead serious. <br/>I love the state of  georgia, really. <br/>We've got a creek  below our house. 68 steps to go down there. I was running that 10 times a day getting in shape for this, running three  miles a day and swimming, too. <br/>You seem like a real  cool lady. <br/>Honey, you can stay  at my house any time. Even if I'm not there, the door is already open. Got turkeys, got a dog that lives in the yard. I feel very safe plus I have a shotgun, a .22. <br/>Jane and I clicked  right away. She's a good, old lady. She's an awesome lady. She talks with a twang. She reminds me at home. I miss my home. I miss my mother. Her and I can connect very well. <br/>They treated me like  I was the ugly duckling over here because I had a southern accent and I'm a  red neck. <br/>I had no idea you  were so bad. I love a north carolina girl. People need to stick together. <br/>And I knew right then  and there, you're a north carolina boy, I'm a north carolina girl, we're  going to hit it off really good. And I was talking to Chase about his dad passing and my husband passing, so  I've got a connection with him, with Chase. <br/>What are we doing? Breakfast, huh? <br/>Don't take a big ass  bite, either. <br/>Hey, is this cool? Naonka? <br/>I guess, I don't know. It's day 20, we don't have a lot of food left and I woke up this morning very  irritable. It was my idea to make the tortillas and the fact that I'm the last to get  everything and I get the smallest tortilla. Okay, you guys want to play. I can play, too. <br/>Don't take a big  bite, Fabio. <br/>I just wanted it test  it out you know. <br/>This morning, after  we were done eating breakfast, na took the flour and put it in her bag, and  she got up and she walked out of camp. And I thought that was a little strange. Why did she just take the flour? <br/>I'm hiding the flour  because those tortillas were good and everybody was being stingy and I put a  lot of my heart and soul into making those things and I made a big one for me  and they all took it. They really made me mad. So I'm going to make them mad. Don't play with me in this game. I can play dirty. I am stealing equipment to make tortillas, and I'm taking fruit. I've taken bowls and spoons. It tastes better when you're stealing it. It's like a sweet victory. Alina, everybody is against her right now. I don't mind being that one person that, you know, tells her a little  something-something. <br/>So where do you stand? Do you stand with the six we talked about or are you back with Brenda? <br/>I'm with the six. <br/>If anybody I was  worried about is you. <br/>Why? <br/>Because it looks like  you're back with Brenda. I mean, you spent all day with her yesterday. <br/>I was catching up  with her. <br/>Do you think the  first vote will still be Marty? <br/>Kelly is right there. I'll tell you right now, they're gunning for you. <br/>Why do people want to  get rid of me? <br/>They're gunning for  you, man, I don't know. <br/>Do they have the  numbers to do that? <br/>They don't have me. I don't know who else they got, but it sounds like it. <br/>Every single person  that claimed they were going to be strong six totally lied. And there I am the fool that was sitting there like I really am going to do  this to these people. <br/>But you have to bust  your ass. <br/>I was thinking of  another plan, other than just winning. I've got to get some numbers. <br/>Who? Everybody is against you. <br/>Why is everybody  against me? <br/>I don't know. <br/>I busted my ass since  day one out here. <br/>Everything everybody  is looking at you right now that you don't have an alliance. I think they think that you're a threat but you're easy to get out. <br/>I can't believe you  grabbed all this stuff. You're crazy. <br/>I'm having fun. You gotta have fun. <br/>It's so good. <br/>My reason for telling  Alina that you're going to be the first one out, that's a vote that I'll have  guaranteed when she's a part of the jury. So I have to be smart. If I want to keep talking to Alina, because I want her to feel safe with me. I want her to know I have her back even though I kind of don't but I kind of  do at the same time. It's like a toss-up. <br/>Do you know where the  big wooden bowl went? <br/>Last time I saw it,  it was right over there and it's not there anymore. <br/>What about the frying  pan? Is that gone, too? For sure, for sure? The bowl and the frying pan? <br/>Yup. <br/>That didn't just get  swept away by the tide, you guys. <br/>Hey, where's the  flour? <br/>No way! They took the flour! <br/>Are you serious? <br/>That's really uncool. <br/>Naonka, did you put  the flour back in the chest? I saw her take it and put it in her bag. <br/>And I put it back,  and I said I put it back. <br/>You put it in your  bag? <br/>And I put it back. I didn't even put it in my bag. <br/>Why did it go in the  bag? <br/>I was going to put  half in there. <br/>You understand why  everybody is wondering why you put it in your back? <br/>I didn't take it,  uncle Dan, I didn't take it. Fabio, I didn't take it. Sash I didn't take it. I'm done, Fabio. I already said what I'm going to said. <br/>I don't know why it  had to go in your bag. <br/>What do you want me  to do? <br/>Just so you know,  nobody on the tribe understands why it had to go in your bag. <br/>I put it back. <br/>We're not asking you  if you put it back or not! We're not-- we're not asking you whether you put it... It doesn't make any  sense! <br/>Oh, my God. It was so hard to sit there. It's not like I was free of guilt. Obviously, I'm totally connected with the fact that she did that. Because I knew about it, and I didn't stop her and I didn't tell anybody  about it. The reason it was so hard for me to own up to it, everybody might be equally  as pissed off as me as they are at NaOnka. <br/>Are you putting my  name out there? <br/>No. It needs to come out. Everything needs to come out. What happened? What this tribe needs right now, is this comes out. <br/>For everything to  just come back here. I don't understand why everybody has to put names. What do you want a name? <br/>That's the thing, a  lot of people now know it was you. You might as well say it. <br/>That's what I'm  saying. It's the right thing to do is just 'fess up. Everybody will appreciate it and respect you so much more. <br/>I told everybody  individually I did not take it. <br/>You lied. You lied in "Survivor?" Everyone will get  that. <br/>Everyone's lied in  "Survivor." I lied for you guys. I'm just trying to play the game but I did not do it with the intention to  starve everyone. Alina and I took a walk. <br/>Alina with you when  you took the bowl out there? <br/>I did grab the flour  and my purpose was to measure it out for half and half because we were using  a whole lot of food. <br/>Were you doing that  to half the flour-- let's be straight all the way through-- or were you going  to save some of that flour later to use it for your advantage and share it. <br/>No, I was trying to  portion it out. <br/>She's saying she was  doing it for the better of the tribe. Sorry, I'm not buying it. <br/>You don't have to buy  it. <br/>I could have said,  "Guys, we're using way too much flour. Let's chill." There are a number of  ways I could have gone about it but I went another way. You guys don't need to point the finger at her. It's not like it was her idea. It wasn't. <br/>Thank you. Thank you, that's a nice thing... I apologize. <br/>We'll try to make it  easy. <br/>Stealing food of all  things, in "Survivor," you would think that having done what she  did, would mean you're done, like, instantly gone. But anybody that's on the chopping block can be valuable to somebody else. She lied and she stole. How easy is that? Get rid of her. It should be that simple but this game is never simple. <br/>Marty. <br/>What's for breakfast. <br/>It was crazy NaOnka  would think of something as ridiculous as stealing the frying pan, bowl, and  all the stuff to mix tortillas, but Alina confessed to being a part of it. She's had a target for the longest time, and on top of all of that, she has  this? It sucks to be Alina right now. <br/>Naonka definitely is  not one of the favorite people in camp at the moment but that works perfectly  into my game plan as having her as one of the final three because that pretty  much guarantees her that she's not going to receive any million-dollar votes. <br/>I reassured all the  guys that Alina needs to go home first tonight, and just keep on doing what  you're doing, and kind of pretend like you're sorry, you know. And every day it will just kind of be a thing of the past. And if her-- your name goes on the chopping block, we'll pick one of them. You're my number one girl here. <br/>Ditto. <br/>Brenda! <br/>Uh-oh! <br/>She caught another  fish. <br/>Fish Dance. <br/>Yo, baby. Yo, baby. <br/>Is this the fourth  fish? <br/>Fifth. Somebody come help me get some fresh water. <br/>Yeah, I'll get right  on it. The more Jane stays in the game, the more complicated the game gets. I think they all see the connection she made with Chase. I bet you that can't be unwound, the whole carolina thing and "My momma  told me" and all that crap has now infected Chase and it's going to  continue to spread like cancerous tentacles through the tribe. You let somebody like Jane get under the radar, the further it goes the more Dangerous  it is. I mean, her story is the saddest story ever on earth, and her catching fish--  every time she cashes fish, the whole Jane Dance and everything, all that  stuff, all of a sudden, you're going to be sitting there like holy cow. I think it's a done deal. Anybody that goes to final with her, you're cooked. <br/>Marty has the wrong  perception of Jane, but Marty is somebody to watch because he is talking to Benry  and Fabio and, Dan and if he wants somebody out so badly, maybe he already  has a really good strategy to get to the end. So maybe it is just good to get rid of it before we all start getting warped. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys! Shall we get to today's challenge? <br/>All: Yes. Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First things  first, Dan, I'll take back immunity. <br/>No more baby cortez. <br/>Jeff: Tribal immunity  is no more. Individual immunity is what you seek. For today's challenge, you will each have two metal handles that you will use  to keep tension on a steel bar. If you release the tension even for a moment, the steel bar will drop, your  tile will break, you're out of the challenge. The last man and the last woman standing win immunity. Two people will be safe from the vote at tribal council. Make sense? <br/>All: Yup. Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Draw for spots,  we'll get started. All right, here we go. For immunity. Everybody grab your handles, get some tension on that bar. In three, two, one, lift. All right, let's release their tiles. This challenge is on. And Purple Kelly is first out. Followed right by Dan. Just like that, three seconds in, we lose our first two. Alina is out. And not happy. Remember, you've got to get tension on that bar. Total concentration. Brenda is out. Benry's out. This is about wanting it. Keep digging. Sash is out of the challenge. Naonka is out of the challenge. Very quickly we are down to Jane versus Holly for the women, Marty, Fabio, Chase  for the men. Holly struggling. Holly out of the challenge. Jane is the last woman standing. Jane wins immunity for the women. [applause] Good job, Jane! <br/>Jeff: You can drop. <br/>You sure? <br/>Jeff: I'm sure. <br/>What if I want to  beat them? <br/>Jeff: Go for it. Jane has already won immunity, does not want to give up yet, trying to prove  a point in this game, gonna stay in this challenge even though she already  has a necklace. <br/>She's a north  carolina girl, jeff. <br/>You got it, Jane. <br/>Picking up 80-pound  dogs helps. <br/>Jeff: Marty is out of  the challenge. We are now down to Fabio and Chase. Oldest woman out here, one of the last three standing against two of the  young, strong guys. Chase drops his bar, Fabio wins immunity for the men. Jane wins immunity for the women. <br/>Nice job, Fabio. [applause] I'm not breaking my  tile! <br/>Jeff: Jane, come on  over. Fabio, come on over. <br/>Good job, Jane. <br/>Good job, you guys. <br/>Jeff: Jane wins  immunity. Jane is safe at tribal council tonight. Fabio also has immunity. Fabio also safe. Jane and Fabio safe tonight at tribal council. Everybody else fair game. Should be an interesting afternoon. Our first merged tribal council. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Congrats. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Nice job, guys. <br/>Nice job, you guys. <br/>Let me see my girls  over here. <br/>Congratulations! <br/>Good job! <br/>Hey, can I get in? <br/>Get in here! <br/>Another one. <br/>My whole goal today  was to beat Marty. <br/>Jane, very impressive,  Jane. Very impressive, Jane. [applause] I'm just trying just  to prove to Marty, you know what? I may be little, I may be small, but there ain't no way in hell on a  individual challenge that you will beat me. So... [grunts, laughs] So we need to get,  like, us girls together and Sash, and get Marty out. And that's it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>If you guys tell me  you're voting for me now, they'll never see it coming, and you can blame Marty. <br/>I don't. <br/>I needed to win today. Um, I know that I'm in the hot seat, but I'm not the only one that is. I know that Jane hates Marty and she wants to see him gone, and Jane has a  lot of numbers on her side, and I happen to be on her side, too. So I'm trying to lay low, and hope that maybe the drama that's going on is  not gonna revolve around me. <br/>I'm down to vote  whoever: Marty or Alina out. I'm gonna voter either one, whichever one everyone decides. It's just, we have to get her out second. <br/>Yeah, we will. I think she's a bigger threat. <br/>I think in  challenges, I think he demoralizes our entire camp. <br/>He does demoralize  our entire camp. <br/>One, two, three, four. <br/>Purple kelly. <br/>Purple kelly is five. <br/>That's seven right  there. <br/>That's seven. <br/>You guys need to,  well, we need to try to talk to all of them, because as far as Sash goes,  it's Alina. <br/>Make sure. <br/>Well, everybody was  debating about Marty and Alina, but Jane really, really wants Marty out,  like, even if we were to just all write down Alina, she will be the one to  write down Marty. <br/>See, it's between Marty  or Alina. I'll just go with the majority, man. <br/>I'll let you know. <br/>Um, I have to ask you  guys a big favor. You know, back in the forum, I promised Marty that if we go to next tribal,  and if he's on the outs, that I would give him the idol. That's the only way he would give it to me. So all I'm asking is to wait until the next round. If you really want Marty out, it's fine. But just don't make me go back on my word tonight. <br/>Then what are you  gonna do next round? <br/>No, it's only for one  tribal council. <br/>Well, what if he wins  immunity the next time? <br/>No, it's only tonight. 'cause I only promised him the next tribal council. I gave him my word, and I don't want to, I don't want to start to break  promises right away. <br/>Well, give me the  idol. I'll hold it, and you don't have it no more. <br/>But I thought the plan  from the beginning... There's really no  rush to take out Marty. <br/>Well, what if he gets  individual immunity the next three times? <br/>What about the  immunity? We have eight more times to go, you know? <br/>How do you want to do  it? <br/>Well, for the longest  time it's been Alina. It's only a matter of time. I mean, like I told you all the time, just don't worry. There's no need to. <br/>I am his target. <br/>Right, but we're your  alliance. <br/>Okay. There are a lot of people that want Marty out, but it all goes back to Sash making  some agreement with Marty when he got him to give the idol to him when he was  on the La Flor tribe so he could "Gain trust." Marty's always a  threat. Marty, to me, is the biggest threat, so I'm not voting for Alina, I'm not. 'cause I don't feel right about voting somebody out that I don't think should  be leaving right now. <br/>Me? <br/>Yeah. <br/>But that's just your  gut. <br/>No, it's-it's not a  blindside. <br/>That's what he told Dan. <br/>What? <br/>That's what he told Dan,  I'm being set up for a blindside. <br/>All the numbers,  everyone I've spoken to, said it's Alina. <br/>Chase is now  definitely, in my book, a moron, because you don't go tell someone you're  gonna blindside somebody if you have at least four or five votes behind you. I mean, you don't even broach the subject. <br/>Chase went up to Danny  and said we're gonna blindside Marty tonight. <br/>It sounds like he's  trying to turn on-on our-our guys. <br/>You guys blindside Marty  tonight? <br/>That's what he told Danny. <br/>Chase didn't mention  any of that to me, so... I just never hear it  from you. I mean, I give you any information I can. I'm not a player in this game. I don't have power. I don't have numbers. I don't have an idol anymore. I don't have anything. That's it. I'm a zero threat, so to people to even spend an ounce of energy thinking  about voting Marty off is crazy. <br/>Marty's been coming  up to me constantly today, almost too much. I think he believes that he's on the chopping block, which only by being more  and more paranoid on his part, is he really placing a bigger target on his  back. I think his best move would be to lay low, but that's not his style, and he's  actually digging his own grave at the moment. <br/>Everyone says they're  voting for Alina, but there's other stuff going on that I think votes will be  cast against me and people will try to get me. <br/>No, they are. They're voting for Alina. I've heard "Alina." and I'm telling you that... That's what I'm  hearing. But can I count on you, south dakota word of honor that you'll vote for Alina  tonight? <br/>I'm voting for Alina. That's all I've heard. <br/>But I haven't heard  you say the south dakota word of honor. <br/>The south dakota word  of honor, I heard "Alina." That you'll vote for Alina. <br/>But we are still not  gonna have enough. Sash is not gonna change his. Brenda's not gonna change hers. <br/>See, those are the  two splits right now. <br/>Right. <br/>See, I'm voting Marty. <br/>That means there's  you, you, kelly purple... The two right now  that are split votes is Sash and Brenda. Sash is not gonna go back on his word. <br/>Okay, so even if we  don't get Sash, then that's fine. Holly, Jane, me, Chase, kelly purple, NaOnka. That's six. If we can get one more. If we could get Fabio. <br/>What's up? <br/>So I've been talking  to everybody, and it looks like we have six people to vote for Marty, and we  need one more and that will be seven. Obviously, everyone wants Marty gone, it's just-- is it going to be me or him  first? And I think it should be him first. <br/>It should be NaOnka  first. <br/>Well, please don't throw  a random NaOnka vote. If you want to, vote NaOnka, you don't have to be part of the 6-6, and five  will vote for me, and six will vote for Marty. If you want to be strategic about it, it will make sense. <br/>This is why everybody  wants you off. You're Dangerous. <br/>I play the game smart. <br/>Yeah, but every time  you talk to anybody, it's always a hidden motive. <br/>Hidden motive? <br/>This isn't so hidden  but-- I'm going home  tonight or I'm going to bust my ass to not go home tonight. What do you expect me to do, roll over? <br/>I understand that. No, I don't. <br/>I understand  everybody thinks I'm Dangerous but it's either my ass is going home tonight  or I'm going to fight for it. <br/>I would piss a lot of  people off by doing that. I don't know, what do you want me to say, take Marty out now when I've been  friends for Marty for a while and I get along with him and I enjoy him around  camp and so do a lot of other people. <br/>It seems to me we get  along, too, but. <br/>I, well... Jeff: Holly, this is  it now. 12 people for a million bucks. Can you sense the game starting to change? <br/>Absolutely. I mean, people want to save themselves, so they're going to do anything that  they possibly can to get to the end. And if you just agree with what everybody else says, that's not going to get  you to the end. You have to take a risk. <br/>Jeff: Marty, do you  feel as though big moves are going to start happening? <br/>I absolutely do. And I think the windows of opportunity for big moves sometimes shut quickly,  and you've got to seize those opportunities because they don't always come up. Now, I just want to clear the air a little bit for the whole tribe and  everybody here because there's been some misconception. And the misconception was by miss Jane they either didn't like miss Jane or  that somehow I didn't bond with her. The fact is, within 30 minutes of the game starting, Jane began a series of  bad mistakes and bad decisions-- namely, aligning herself with three of the  weakest players that were subsequently eliminated. <br/>Whoa, whoa, whoa,  whoa, whoa! I approached you, and y'all fluffed me off. <br/>I don't make an  alliance in 30 minute. <br/>How do you know if  I'm strong or not, Marty. <br/>You let the little  old lady from south carolina that catches the catfish. If she makes it to the final three, if you watch "Survivor," this  woman will take the million dollars. She has the saddest story of human tragic loss, of needing the money  desperately. You can't write a better story. And I will go one step further, and this will be the last compliment I make,  by the way, to miss Jane, if Jane makes it to the final three, I will cast my  vote for this woman. She would deserve it, and the people that allowed her to get there made a  strategic error. They don't deserve the million bucks. It's just honesty. It's the game. <br/>It's personal. <br/>There's no personal  or nothing. I don't care if people are black white, old, young, everyone's won this  game-- gay, straight, whatever. If you think someone is going to take a million bucks out of your pocket,  that's what you've got to be thinking about. <br/>Jeff: Alina, on the  flip side could Marty have hurt himself tonight by being so vocal harsh about  Jane? <br/>I think he's  illustrating perfectly to this tribe what a strong strategic player he is and  how smart he is about this game because he just posed himself as the biggest  threat out here. Do you keep that guy around? <br/>Jeff: Dan. <br/>We had two people on  this tribe steal our food. They took the bowls, the cooking oil, the frying pan, the flour, and they hid  it in the woods. <br/>Jeff: Who was it, Dan? <br/>Nay and Alina took  the food. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka and Alina,  you guys took food? <br/>Me, it was me. She was just with me. I robbed the tribe, but I gave it back because I was pushed into a corner. But, I mean, I gave it back. Nobody was hurt. <br/>You wouldn't have  given it back if we hadn't found out. <br/>Jeff, I got punished  for... You didn't get  punished. <br/>Jeff: How did you get  punished? <br/>Nobody talk to me. <br/>Oh! <br/>Come on! <br/>Jeff: Alina, what's  your culpability in this? <br/>I was put in a really  weird position. Do I out her for doing something like that and telling everybody, that's  indicating myself, too. That's taking the blame for being part of it, and I was fine with doing that  because I was part of it and I admit my guilt to it. <br/>Jeff: What do you do  to get the target off your back after being involved in this food stealing? The thing is, jeff, I'm a really good swing vote. If somebody needs a number, hey, I'm a number. It's pretty obvious, if you want to be smart strategically in this game you  don't pick somebody who is a powerhouse. You pick somebody who is a pawn, and I'm a pawn. <br/>Jeff: All right, well  there's certainly been a lot said tonight. Time to find out how it's going to play out. Jane, Fabio. You both have individual immunity. I assume you're both going to keep it. You cannot vote for Jane, you cannot vote for Fabio. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. Jane, you're up. <br/>I hope everybody is  smart tonight. <br/>It's either me or you  tonight, so let the best argument win. <br/>You a 100% grade  "A" dirt squirrel, and it's time for you to go home. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally  the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. All right, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Marty. Marty. Two votes Marty. Alina. One vote Alina. Alina. Two votes Marty, two votes Alina. Alina. That's three votes Alina, two votes Marty. Alina, four votes Alina, two votes Marty. Alina, that's five votes Alina, two votes Marty. Alina, that's six votes Alina, two votes Marty. Ninth person voted out and the first member of our jury, Alina. That's seven. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Alina, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Jeff: Well, tonight's  vote would seem to indicate that you are still making decisions as a group  and that kind of thinking can't work forever. Something's got to give. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for  scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on  "Survivor." It should really be  you and me running the show. <br/>Jeff: Sash and Brenda  struggle to hold on to power. <br/>People need to  remember where their place is. <br/>Jeff: And at tribal  council... I can see through Marty. <br/>Like Marty said. <br/>Wait a minute. This is crazy. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka lets her  freak flag fly. Naonka, I think I'm speechless. <br/>I was really hoping  that I wasn't gonna go home. Why would they keep Marty over me? Anybody with any smarts about this game would've kept me instead of Marty. It doesn't even make sense. He's such a bigger threat than I am. These people are stupid and I know, eventually, the fact that they kept Marty  is gonna bite them in the butt and they're gonna totally regret it. Stupid move.
