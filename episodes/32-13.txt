<br/>jeff: But instead his alliance turned on him.  Jeff: Jason, the tribe has spoken. Leaving the four strong and Tai unsure of  his place in the game. Five are left. Who will be voted out tonight. I have  to come back tonight after tribal and try to think what exactly happened. I thought  everybody was voting Michele, but all four of them vote for Jason, so I actually  wasted the vote tonight and I was in the dark. That's the worst thing to do,  to be kept outside the circle. One thing I always say about this alliance, we  always listen to each other.  The thing about is an alliance, you don't turn on it.  I agree.  And you've done it now three times, though, so...  My whole time Aubry and you and Joe, I always say everybody has a vice,  including you, Joe.  But I don't.  CerTainly you're part of the group, and I’m always confused where you sit. I’m  honest with you. I've talked to you about it. I say, when it comes to final  four...  When it comes to final four, I’m the easy out.  This is before you joined.  I was in the group before you. Tai voted both of his votes toward me because  obviously he wants to put me on the outs, and it's kind of like a slap in the  face.  It's a game.  We all went with Jason tonight. That's the way it should have been. It's  fine. Fortunately I lucked out that Cydney does protect me, but I did get votes  against me, so I don't know where I stand, and I could get voted out next.  Seriously, there were two alliances to me that do not involve you, Michele. I  know that sounds hurtful, but do you understand where?  No, but that's okay. I don't need to understand you.  All right.  You know, whatever.  I feel really confused. I don't know exactly what happened. Aubry's the one  who told me she felt strongly that Michele should go home, but my feelings  are hurt, but especially Aubry. She's the only one I truly trust. And I feel  like she pulled a fast one on me. Why am I out on a limb when it was a group,  you and I agreed that it's going to be Michele and I’m totally fine with it  being Jason.  People felt like when it came up in a group that they weren't allowed to  express their opinion.  But I’m not dictating. So what if I don't listen. Come along or not come  along. At least I’m aware of it.  I should have told you. I should have told you.  I left Tai out of the loop on the vote because Tai has had so much control in  this game, and I needed to reclaim it. But Tai feels like I betrayed him, and  that's very big to Tai when he feels like he's been hurt. And so I’m not sure  I can work with Tai.  I'm confused whether... Are you with me, are you not with me?  I'm kind of confused now, too, because... This whole thing was confusing,  too.  I never changed my vote. I said, I’m going to try to clear out... We talk  about Aubry. You know better. You and I back and forth. I’m reasonable. I listen  to everything.  I told Tai people didn't feel like they had a voice.  Right. I understand.  But you make me feel unreasonable.  I made you feel unreasonable.  You know me. That's not who I am. I felt completely alone. I don't know who  to trust. I’m most worried about Aubry and Joe. I put all my eggs in their  basket, and I don't know where to move from here.  Jeff: Come on in, guys. We are down to five. All right. You guys ready to get  to today's reward challenge?  Yeah.  Jeff: For today's challenge you'll race into the jungle to a large wooden  ladder. You'll climb up and retrieve sandbags. You'll then race back an  attempt to launch those sandbags into a series of targets. First person to  get one sandbag in each of their five targets wins reward. Want to know what  you're playing for?  Yes.  Jeff: The winner will leave here and be take toen to a "Survivor"  spa. First you'll have a bath, wash that body, wash that hair, get clean.  Then massage. Then you eat -- chicken, beef, cheesecake.  Oh, cheesecake.  Jeff: And you will spend the night for the first time in 33 days, you will  sleep on a real bed. You'll wake up, return to camp, hopefully refreshed and  with everything you need to get you through these last few days. I know it's  worth playing for. Draw for spots. We'll get started. All right. Here we go.  For reward, Survivors ready? Go! First you got to make a big run through the  jungle uphill to get your first bag of sandbags. Then you got to race back.  You each have three bags. Got to bring them back one at a time. It's Cydney  back with her first bag. That was fast. Here comes Michele. Aubry. Tai with  their first bags. You got to empty them and then start tossing one bag at a  time. Cydney launches a little short. Michele a little short. Aubry just  misses. Cydney scores her first bag. Aubry scores her first bag. Tai just  misses. Cydney heading back in. Aubry heads back in. Michele heading back out  for more. Tai with his last bag. No, Tai misses. He's heading back into the  jungle. Joe back. Last to get back. He still has five bags. He could nail them  all right here. Joe taking his time. Joe now with his first launch. Got the  hit your color for it to count. Joe just misses. Aubry has one. Cydney has  one. That is it. Joe with his last bag. Won't do it. Joe heads back into the  jungle. Cydney back with her second bag. Aubry right behind her. Here comes Michele.  And Tai. They're launching. Cydney puts another one in the same bucket. Still  counts as one. Aubry scores her second. Cydney just short. Tai just misses. Aubry  misses. Cydney just missed. Everybody close. But missing. Cydney scores her  second. Aubry scores her third. Michele still coming up empty. Tai heading  back out. Michele gets her first. Aubry racing back with her third bag. She's  in the lead. Aubry has three. Only two targets left. You need to make these  count. Aubry launches. Just misses. Cydney back with her third and final bag.  Aubry with a huge launch and it connects. Aubry has four. One left for Aubry.  This could be it. Close, but no, Aubry with two bags left. After that she is  out of bags. Aubry is on her last bag. This is it. She's got to do it here. Aubry  misses. She's out of bags. Now she's got to wait and hope everybody else uses  up all their bags. Then we will replenish. Michele with her third bag. Just  misses. Cydney just misses. Cydney is now out of bags. Here comes Joe with  his second bag. Joe has his first. Joe with a nice toss. Joe now with a  second. Joe back in this now. Michele with another launch. Just misses. Tai is  out of bags. Michele is out of bags. Everybody is out of bags except Joe.  That was another nice toss. Joe has three. Joe still has one bag left. He's  heading back into the jungle. Very interesting situation. Aubry, Cydney, Michele  and Tai were much faster than Joe, raced ahead, could not get it done. Now Joe  has time on his side. Doesn't need to race. Can take his time and could win  it right here. Can take his time and could win it right here.  Okay, Joe. Come on.  Jeff: Joe heading back with his third and final bag. Joe, you're sitting on  three. You have two targets left. Everybody else out of bags. This is yours  to win right here. The two furthest targets, you are going to have to launch  to get them there. That won't count. Just misses. Close, but no. Joe down to  two bags. Got to sink them both. Oldest guy out here. Could he pull it off  right here? And he has his fourth. Joe down to one target left.  Good job, Joe.  Jeff: The further one. Could win it right here. Nobody else can do anything.  They're out of bags. Joe gets it done!  Oh, my God.  Jeff: At 71 wins individual reward.  Nice job.  Good job.  I'm so happy for you.  Oh, my gosh.  You did it.  You finally did it.  Jeff: Joe, come on over. Nice job. All right. Now, Joe, you have a decision  to make. Because the spa is really nice, but sometimes you want some time  alone. On "Survivor" we like you to have a little company. Choose  one person to join you on this reward, bath, massage, food, and a good  night's sleep?  I think I have to go with my brain partner from the very beginning, we stuck  together, Aubry.  Jeff: Aubry, come on over. Aubry going to join you. All right, Joe. You have  to make one more decision, Cydney, Michele, Tai, who you going to pick, and  already Aubry is chatting you up.  Cydney.  Jeff: Cydney will join Joe and Aubry.  I chose Cydney to go because everything is kind of up in the air with Tai, so  that kind of forces me to look at what my other options are to go to the end.   Jeff: All right. Joe, nice job. Joe, Aubry, Cydney, grab your stuff.  As I leaving the reward challenge, I’m thinking, Cydney, Aubry and Joe,  that's maybe final three. So I definitely have the take a risk and try and  find a way to change the pecking order.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wow, guys. Look at this. Are you kidding me? This is fantastic. I’m going to  try that first I think.  I'm loving this chicken.  The chicken is dlirks. -- delicious.  We land on this gorgeous beach, and we scarf and gorge ourselves on all this  magnificent food. It's like heaven.  The meat is so tender. Wow. And I don't eat a lot of meat because I’m in the  a big steak guy, but this is phenomenal.  All I needed right here.  This is the best meal I could have won. I was running out of fuel, guys. I cannot  believe I won today. I was absolutely thrilled. And you get a more  substantial male, meat and stuff. It's a huge advantage for me. I’m loving  this protein, wow. With six days to go for me to be refortified like this is  beyond my wishes. The whole reward couldn't have been better.  I love beef.  All beef. Joe's all beef.  Mr. Joe is loading up on beef and beef and beef like it was bad. And I knew  from my personal experience that mr. Joe wasn't going to be in a good place  later on.  You won, Joe!  Gosh. Well, while we're here, what would you like to do now at the end? It  would be nice for us to... I'd like to see if we can pull it off?  Me too.  Are we going to vote Tai off.  We can't. He has an idol.  So it would have to be next one? Are you good with that, get rid of Tai?  Are you good with that?  That's your competition. Cydney and I are --  i'm with that. Aubry, Joe and myself could be a final three. I’m trying to  downplay myself as much as possible. At this point I’m nodding and smiling  and happy to win a million dollars.  Aubry thinks she has a lot of enemy, but everybody knows how tough you played  the game. Being social like I was is not going to get you anything. Cydney  has been quiet and stuff. We're no threat. At all.  I think everybody has played their own kind of game.  There are other threats in this game in different ways.  Joe says I am the only threat basically in this game right now, and that Cydney  was content being in the final three, which is such baloney. It just made me  reaLize, oh, my God, Cydney is a threat in this game. She was a key part of  some blind sides. She's won a challenge, and two-to-a degree she's more  likable. So maybe I don't want to go to the final three with Cydney. Tai might  be a better option for me. This is exactly what I needed to get my head back  on.  Good for Joe.  Yeah.  I kind of figured that it was going to be the three of them no matter what.  Oh, to go?  Yeah. I thought Aubry would take... Yeah, yeah. I know they have a close  relationship, too, you know.  We lose the challenge, so Joe brings Aubry and Cydney. Obviously those are  the final three they're thinking about. So I’m genuinely hurt with Aubry  because I don't know where Aubry's heart is. I mean, I don't know if you're  open to it, at some time i'd like to just talk honest talk.  You want to talk now?  Let's go in the water and sit together and talk.  Okay. Sounds good.  So I come into camp. I say, oh, no, how am I going to spend the next 24 hours  or so with Michele where I just fought with her. The only thing I can do is  to air it out with her. Last night was just... The whole thing was just ugly.   Yeah.  Yesterday I feel really hurt, but it's a game.  Yeah. I definitely didn't mean to hurt you, but I mean, you had it out for  me.  I don't know why. I draw to cerTain people and I don't draw to cerTain  people. But somehow like we don't have the chemistry. Maybe you're a very  beautiful girl. I feel uncomfortable or something, not just you, cerTain  people I let my guard down. CerTain people I put up my guard.  I understand.  I can't explain that. I go through my whole life like that.  Yeah. Tai says that he bases all of his relationships in his life on the  chemistry that he feels with people. I get that. You have stronger  connections with some people than with others, but when you're in a game  like, this you have to play all your avenues. My door has never ever been  closed to you, and it's almost like you pick and choose who you want to get  close to and then shut other people off. I think what it comes down to is  that me and Tai are very different people and we have very different  perceptions on this game. Let's just take it easy. It's going to be our own  sort of relaxation.  I'll give you a massage.  Yay. Oh, my God.  I'm good.  I can't wait.  I think Michele and i, we're on the bottom, but Michele and I were in the  beauty tribe before we merged. Maybe I missed something. Maybe i'll have an  opportunity to get to know Michele a little bit better.  You are good at this. Feels good. Kind of feels like a thai massage.  You are having a Tai massage.  At the end of the day was a Tai massage. It's a Tai massage because it's thai  in method and Tai's the masseuse.  Oh, the chicken is joining us.  Honestly, this totally beats their massage.  And i'll feed you even later with some mango.  We are kind of having a poor man's spa while they're having their real man's  spa. Who would have ever thought, we fought last night...  I remember the words you used. It just sealed like how...  Sorry. Who would have ever thought that Michele and Tai would have bonding  massage and a dinner date. It's like I don't know. What has this world come  to.  So I’m thinking that there's a possibility of us doing something together. In  the game. But I just...  We're kind of both on the outs it appears right now. I just feel like if I lose,  I’m done. And if you lose the next one, I feel like you're done.  I'm tentative to say anything or do anything with Tai after what happened  last time, but me and Tai are seemingly both on the outs. You know my door is  always open.  There's only two of us. There's three of them. We could brainstorm some  scenario. We can figure this out.  Yeah.  Couldn't we?  Yeah, I think so. It would be such a great move on our part, and completely  shocking because I don't think anyone thinks at this point that me and Tai have  the capability to work together.  I have an idol.  And then it's us two.  Who do we pick? This would be the only obvious choice.  You think Cydney would be the one to sway? That would be risky business.  The idea of working with Michele just never crossed my mind. But I just feel  completely betrayed by Aubry. So I’m open to working with Michele because Aubry  would never see that coming.  Well, yeah, that's true. I have nothing to lose.  Neither do i. Why you back so early. I want you to stay and have breakfast.  After the reward, coming back the camp, I know that Cydney's a threat. And my  ideal final three is Tai and Joe.  You have wine?  No, we had champagne.  Oh, my God new york a hot tub?  By my fear is that Tai is so emotionally needy is that if he feels he's been  betrayed or slighted, he might go another way.  Come on in. Welcome home. I have a fire. My God. Today I need to talk to Tai and  make things right. And at the end of the day, I know that Joe will go with  what I go with.  How are you doing?  I'm okay. Yeah. Checking my thoughts, you know.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I don't know how you're feeling. I know a lot has happened, but we need to  have another option at the end if something goes wrong.  I'm not sure how you're feeling, but I took time alone to think about some  stuff, and I don't know where you stand...  I don't know.  I need Tai to trust me and know that the only way to the end is for us to do  it together. At the end of the day, you know that Joe will go I believe with  what I think the right decision is.  Yeah. Yeah.  And I know that you are the right... There's not even a question at this  point. I know we've had some rocky times, but if we stay together, we have a  higher chance of getting to the final three.  Yeah. Okay.  Tai has to feel he can trust me. Because we have five people left. I need to  be in a group of three people. If I have Joe and Tai, that's three against  two. That gives me the little bit of hopefully power I need to get through  the next vote, and I have my fingers crossed right now that Tai's going to  the end with me. Man, you have to just put a lot behind you in "Survivor"  and put one foot in front of the other.  Aubry really poured her heart out to me, saying we need each other.  You're almost there.  That made me feel so comfortable and relief of this burden. It's really taken  a toll on my emotion, and I just broke down a bit.  You need the take time for yourself, too to, not do as many things around  camp.  So far I played the game with my heart, so it feels right that Aubry's on my  side, and I have a tender spot for her from the beginning.  As soon as we hit the beach, we start eating. It was good. I ate until right  before it was time to go.  There was a lot of it?  There must have been eight of those.  Wow.  And you didn't eat any really.  I had one. Just one. The you didn't like it.  It was so good. Yeah.  Then it was a beautiful sunset, clouds and all, and it was real pretty.  I'm aligned with Joe and Aubry pretty tight at this point. So when I see Aubry  and Tai come back from the water, looking a little too comfortable, like a  conversation you would have with an ally. Tai's the pain person I thought we  wanted to get out, but I can read things very, very well, and that didn't sit  too well with me. It seemed very, very suspect.  You can't think one by one anymore.  Nope.  It has to be two steps ahead. Which is stressful.  Uh-huh. But just me and you know that we're solid.  Uh-huh.  Then no matter who wins immunity, you have to convince the other person to  come with us.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Right, right, right. Michele has been trust worthy this whole time. So I rather  have her around, but I want to keep it under wraps like i've been doing and  hopes I don't construe myself in the midst of trying to better my game at the  same time.  We have to make a move.  Uh-huh.  Every little thing we do has to be with a purpose.  Exactly.  It's crazy the way that things turn here. I mean, I thought I was on the  outs, but me and Cydney have had a great relationship for a really long time,  and me and Tai have our plan. So now it looks like we can kind of pick and  choose who we want out, Joe or Aubry. And that would be a crazy twist in this  game. There's no need for any worrying today.  No.  Which is nice.  I'm a little beat up today. I’m having some problems with my stomach. I ate  all that meat yesterday. I’m bloated. And I’m not passing any urine. I’m in a  little discomfort right now in my stomach. I’m hoping that what I have going  on right now is not serious.  Oh, my God.  Wow. You and me could have a danceoff with those moves. If you manage to...  You managed to make that look not spastic at all.  Hi.  Hola. Como esta. What's going on?  I have a bladder problem.  Really?  Yeah.  Water help?  No. I think I have a prostate problem.  What's going on?  Right now it's comfortable, but if it starts swelling up...  You're not feeling too well?  I'm fine. Here we are.  Here we are. This it is, guys.  I'm worried about Joe. Joe is just a steady force for me.  I tell you what, you pour me some more water.  Joe is my second vote. Joe is my confidante. Joe is the anchor to my entire  game. I want Joe to be okay. Joe needs to be okay right now. I need Joe to be  okay.  I'll be back.  What's wrong?  He said he isn't passing water through his prostate?  What? I’m worried that he is in even more pain than he's letting on.  That's painful. That's really painful.  It could be something that could pull him from the game. And when you're this  far in, five people, that's the last thing that you want to see happen. But  at the same time, if Joe goes, it benefits my game. And so I feel bad, but  it's also positive. So it's weird.  Right now I feel a little sick to my stomach because I’m still constipated as  well as the pressure on my bladder. It hurts like crazy. So medical is going  to check on me and give me first runover and make sure all my systems are  pretty good.  How are things?  Here's what's happening, yesterday I went on the reward, and this morning I’m  constipated. And I stopped urinating.  Okay.  Is there anyway we can get that softened up?  This is one thing, the constipation, is probably caused by the food you had  on the reward. So a couple things we can do. We can give you some medicine to  sort that out. Hopefully that will relieve the pressure on the bladder and  you can empty your bladder properly and sort your pain out. The concern is if  this constipation remains and this tube gets completely blocked off and  you're unable to empty your bladder, the worry is it can damage your kidneys  if it's left long enough.  Joe didn't feel well. He wanted to see medical. If Joe went home, it would  screw up everything we planned for final three. I’m very, very nervous.  After having medical visit and receiving medication, it started to get a  little bit better based on drinking all the water and being able to pass more  urine. But I’m in pain all the time, and it's significant. And it's to the  point where I feel like I’m nauseous.  Oh, my God.  Guys, the doctor says if I stop urinating, it's not good. He was hoping that  maybe everything wouldn't shut down.  Joe has been so strong out here, so to see something medically go wrong with  him, it goes to show how crazy this game can be. And you hope that it's going  to be okay.  Keep fighting, Joe, keep fighting.  He said if you stop peeing, that's not good. They'll try and give me some  meds and see what happen, but it's not working.  I know you're fighting.  Every hour it seemed to get worse and worse, and he was doubled over, and I think  he was masking a little bit of how bad, you know, how badly he was in pain.  Good luck.  It's in the fair.  Everybody was in tears. I was in tears. Cydney was in tears. Because, you  know, he's a dear, dear someone in our lives. And it happened so quickly. Ony  and I are both the oldest in this whole tribe. I think there's some kinship  there.  Thank you. Thank you. I feel so special now. You made my boo boo go away.  Mr. Joe was like my substitute grandfather. He said the same thing my grandpa  would say. He'd say, don't cry, just keep moving. He's like, don't cry on me.  He reminded me even more of my granddad at that point.  It's a beautiful sunset.  Yeah.  I wish when I’m 72 years old I will be as tough as you are.  You will.  The pain is getting the a point where it's unbearable. If I let it go, once I  stop urinating it will be very, very bad and it will back up my kidneys, and,  you know, it was to the point where I felt comfortable I needed to see a  doctor again.  Jeff: All right, Joe, let's get you over here for another look.  I'm very torn up. It's very, very painful.  Jeff: Is it visible?  I was concave yesterday and now I’m just all bloated out. I’m in a lot of  pain.  Jeff: So doctor, catch me up. What's happening?  With someone like Joe with Joe's age, unfortunately with that age comes  issues whether you like it or not. You can block the outflow from the  bladder, and that's very, very painful. Age is definitely a factor. I think  it's a combination of things that have come at the same time that have led to  this problem.  Drew: Ironically, you're the last guy to get a reward, and it sounds like  part of the reward, probably all this food you took in is somehow related to  this.  I'll tell you what it was. I haven't eaten meat. I don't eat meat. And they  had these big kebab things. They had three feet of it. I couldn't stop eating  it. I think that's all impacted in there.  Jeff: Joe, as a guy who has gone through a lot in life, where is the level?  I'm pretty tough. I've taken some bumps and grinds, and this is over the top.  I’m at the point where I need something.  Jeff: Is this the case where it's painful but you'll be okay, or is this  actually potentially a medical emergency?  It's something that can be fixed. If it's not fixed, it can cause long-term  problems. This is not something we can fluff out. If you can put up with the  pain, the problem you can potentially have, if the urine can't get out of the  bladder, that pressure can get transferred to the kidneys and transfer  long-term kidney damage.  Jeff: So doctor, you are pulling Joe from the game?  I think with the potential risk of long-term kidney damage, it's the only  safe thing to do.  Jeff: So, Joe, you probably expected this.  I'm at my...  Jeff: You're not surprised he's pulling you?  No. There's no way I can manage through the night here. It would be  miserable.  Jeff: What does it feel like to be this close to the end and get pulled for  ironically something that has nothing to do with your effort of the game but  just a function of being 71?  Jeff, it's extremely disappointing, but it's a physical thing that's  happening here, and I don't want to really jeopardize serious problems down  the line.  Jeff: You have a lot of life left to live.  I hope so. I got pretty far. But there are other things, other challenge,  jeff, that await me. I don't know what they are right now, but I’m always  looking to what's next thing.  Jeff: Joe, you just hit on what i've taken from you. To continue to pursue  things that exhilarate you, to listen to that stirring in your soul that's  looking for the next adventure. Never stop living and getting the most out of  life.  Yeah.  Jeff: I think you are going to be a massive inspiration to people.  Thank you.  Jeff: I remember the phrase that was "getting it done at 71."  getting it done at 71, yeah.  Jeff: You have been getting it done at 71 for 34 days. It has been a pleasure  to watch you plain ato watch -- play and to watch you sociaLize with people  over 50 years younger than you, but this adventure on "Survivor"  has come to an end.  Thanks, jeff. Thanks for the opportunity to play this game. I appreciate it.  Joe leaving the game is like watching family member being sick. Like your  worst nightmare, but you're also relieved because you know Joe is going to  get what he needs to feel better.  Don't be crying. Be well, all of you, and play good, have fun. Bye.  Thanks for making me make decisions and put one foot in front of the other.  You're going to keep doing that when you get done with this thing, too. Be  well. Thank you very much.  Thank you, Joe.  See you see.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  We're going to burn this forest down.  .  Jeff: This is the most evacuations in any season of "Survivor,"  three. It has been the one constant theme of this season: Just when you think  you're safe or just when you fear you're not, something changes, and it just  happened again. Your quest for the million dollars is within sight. But now  more than ever you will have to outwit and outplay if you are to outlast.  It's lake deeãjaaã vu all over again. My biggest  ally Neal goes out right after the merge. And now my other biggest ally Joe  is out. I feel bad for Joe, but this changes everything. I had a really good  plan. And now everything is ruined, I don't know what the hell is going to  happen. Anything is possible.  Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode captioning funded by cbs  jeff: Next time on "Survivor," after 35 of the toughest days in  "Survivor" history, we're down to four, and with alliances up in  the air, it is anybody's game to win.  I reaLize last night.  Jeff: Aubry has lost her closest ally for the second time this season.  It's sad that Joe left.  With Joe gone, I don't have many options.  Jeff: And the scramble to find a new one.  The best move for your game would be to stick with me. I've played this game  making hard decisions. I’m not going to throw it all on an emotional decision  at the eleventh hour.  Jeff: Michele has played a game centered around loyalty.  Your name is not getting written down by me.  Jeff: But now struggles to find a name she can trust.  Jeff: If Tai win, I’m screwed.  I've been on thin ice, but I will fight as hard as I can until my torch is  out.  Jeff: Cydney is playing with fire with competing alliances.  Aubry definitely wants to go to the end with you.  Jeff: Will they carry her to the end or blow up in her face?  There's definitely a trick to being in the middle. You have to play the game,  not let the game play you, especially at the end, because that's the most  important part.
