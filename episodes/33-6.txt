<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," at the ika bula,  Sunday and Bret were in the minority. <br/>I’m down 4-2. <br/>Jeff: At the Takali tribe, Figgy and Taylor were trying to  hide their romance. <br/>Awesome. <br/>Jeff: And Adam found himself in the power spot between  gen-xers and the millennial lovers. <br/>I’m the guy they need to  work with. <br/>Jeff: At the Vanua tribe, gen-x was in control, but there  were cracks within. <br/>I'll do it. <br/>Jeff: And Chris used his relationship with Zeke to pull in  the millennials. <br/>I’m ready to make a move. <br/>Finally, I catch a break in this game. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, the gen-xers gave up their  numbers and safety. <br/>CeCe, the tribe has spoKen. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Jeff: 15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Live to fight another day. <br/>That was really good. <br/>Coming back after tribal council. That was an absolute relief. Chris and I said good-bye the CeCe with these two millennials. <br/>Good job. <br/>It was absolutely the right thing to do going forward. It's no longer millennials versus gen-x, it's the people I trust  versus the people you trust. David, it was great voting with you today. <br/>It was a pleasure voting with you and Michelle. You guys did it. You guys followed through. <br/>Tribal was such a delight because those silly gen-xers  sent home one of their own on the one tribe they had the numbers. Now all of a sudden I seem to be in a power position with Chris,  and I’m so stoked. I'm a brand-new baby in this game of "Survivor." I’m a  brand-new baby in this game of "Survivor."  I am completely hungry. <br/>Right. Everyone is hungry. Everybody is getting grumpy, but I got to stay focused on this  game because I have this passion inside of myself that says, you got to take  care of your family. You want to go get that coconut? <br/>Let's do it. <br/>So I got my mom and my sister, and I inner had a dad or  nothing, so it's like I got to take care of these two beautiful ladies. People say millennials are selfish and they want to do things  their own way and they do whatever they want, but it's not true. This is for my family. I'm going to win "Survivor."  I don't know. <br/>A hidden immunity idol is the only cushion. I need to find this thing, and I’m searching everywhere to find  this thing. <br/>This is weird. <br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. <br/>There's this little green symbol, and I’m like, what the  hell is that? And I see the stamp, and I know it's got to be here somewhere,  but I’m like, no, it's not here, what the hell? I'm looking at the tree I’m looking at all the things, and break  this bamboo! I knew it. And then I hear the "Survivor" song in the background. I'm like, this is awesome. <br/>Holy crap. <br/>I found an idol. <br/>Dude, oh, my God. Dude. My God, man. <br/>This hidden immunity idol means, mom, you just got one  step closer to getting a house. Today is probably the best day I've had on "Survivor."  I’m set right now. <br/>Dude, this stays between me and you. <br/>Secrets, secrets. <br/>Hey, what you got there? <br/>I walk up on them two  huddled up like two eskimos, and out pops this idol. <br/>Well, now we know. <br/>Jay is one of my allies at this point, but do I think Jay  would play that immunity idol on me? Heck no. <br/>That was bad timing. <br/>Horrible. <br/>FricKen Michaela. <br/>Right now I’m not going to tell anybody that Jay has the  idol, but if I get wind of something going down, I’m snitching. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. Both tribes getting your new look at the new Vanua tribe. CeCe voted out at the last tribal council. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: And a lot of reaction. Figgy, you were first one, you were clapping the second you saw  it was CeCe. <br/>I love Michelle. I love you, too, but I was really worried. Sounded really bad. Sorry. Michelle and I are really, really close. I love her. <br/>Jeff: Michelle, does it concern you that in a game like  this Figgy is so open? <br/>No, I think truth works well in this game. <br/>Jeff: You may be the first person to ever say that phrase,  "The truth works well in this game."  I'll own it. <br/>Jeff: All right. You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, one person will be your  caller. The rest of the tribe will be blindfolded. Using only verbal commands, the caller will instruct the blind-folded  tribe members to collect the puzzle pieces. Then the caller will direct a still-blindfolded tribe member to  solve the puzzle. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: First two tribes to finish win reward. Want to know what you're playing for in. <br/>Yes. Please. <br/>Jeff: First tribe to finish...  Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Apple pie, cookie, brownies, iced tea, cold milk. <br/>Apple pie? <br/>Jeff: Second tribe to finish, not bad, chocolate chip cape  cod I cans. All right. Caller, you have one extra member whom are you going to sit out? <br/>Jess. <br/>Me. <br/>Jeff: Ika bula, you have two extra tribe members. Who is it going to be in. <br/>It's going to be Bret and I. <br/>Jeff: Bret and Hannah will sit out. Sit on the bench. Everyone else take a minute the strategize and we'll get it on. Here we go. For a nice reward, Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go right. <br/>Right, right, right, right, right. <br/>Walk forward, walk forward. <br/>Left a little bit. Keep going. <br/>Jeff: All about communication. <br/>Straight. <br/>Left. <br/>Jeff: Are your instructions clear? <br/>Straight. Keep going. To your right. <br/>Stop. <br/>Jeff: Ken on the first obstacle. Sunday on an obstacle. <br/>Turn right. <br/>Go to your left. Keep going, Zeke. <br/>Watch out, watch out. There you go, there you go. You're in the middle. <br/>Jeff: Adam trying to get a pair of puzzle pieces. Sunday still working, getting dizzy now. She's got it free. She falls down. That's what happens. Sunday now dis oriented. Adam has a pair of puzzle pieces. <br/>That's it, Zeke. <br/>Jeff: Zeke has a set of puzzle pieces. There are four sets of puzzle pieces for each tribe. <br/>Michaela, pull that rope right in front of you. Pull, pull, pup. <br/>Jeff: Michaela unspooling for ika bula. Adam back to the table with first set of puzzle pieces for Takali. <br/>Turn around the your left. David, keep walking. Keep walking. <br/>Taylor! Taylor! Pull the rope. <br/>Jeff: Takali with their second set of puzzle pieces. They're opening up a big lead. <br/>Feel the puzzle piece on the thing. <br/>Jeff: Sunday has first set of puzzle pieces for ika bula. <br/>That's it, Chris. Turn it. <br/>David, stop. Turn to your right. Your right. David, you're right! <br/>Jeff: Taylor has untied a set of puzzle pieces. <br/>Go to you left, Taylor, left. <br/>Jeff: Zeke headed back with first pieces for Vanua? <br/>Is this it. <br/>Jeff: Chris has the second set of pieces if he can just  get them back. Will has the second set of puzzle pieces for ika bula. That is the third set for Takali. Takali has one pair of puzzle pieces left. <br/>Okay. Taylor, feel that table. <br/>Jeff: Michaela has the third set of pieces for ika bula. <br/>Run, run, run. <br/>Jeff: Ken and Taylor at that fourth station looking fur  that final pair of puzzle pieces. <br/>Faster, Ken, faster, Ken. <br/>Jeff: Where is it? <br/>It's right in front of you. <br/>Jeff: Chris with the second set of pieces for Vanua. <br/>Say what you want to say to David real fast. <br/>David, walk to your right. <br/>Tell him again. <br/>Walk to your right. <br/>Jeff: David doesn't know which direction to go. Is he headed right, left, north, south? <br/>No, no, you're going to the wrong puzzle. No, David, no. Oh, my goodness. <br/>Keep going, keep going. <br/>I’m an old man. I should not be spinning. <br/>Jeff: Ken takes a big fall. <br/>Is there a key? Is there a key? <br/>Right here. <br/>Michaela, to the right. Get the rope. Untie the rope. <br/>Undo it and get the puzzle pieces. Okay, good. Good. Yes, yes! Straight back. <br/>David, come back. David, come here. David, come here. <br/>Jeff: Ken and Taylor coming back with that last set of  puzzle pieces. They've got it. They can start working on their puzzle. <br/>Separate them evenly. <br/>Jeff: It is now Figgy and Ken trying to solve the puzzle  with Ken blindfolded. <br/>Right there, turn left. Pull it, pull it, pull up. <br/>Jeff: David finally has something to do. David unspooling. Michaela has the fourth and final pair of puzzle pieces. <br/>Use your right hand. <br/>Use your right hand. <br/>Jeff: And David and Zeke trying to get the last two for Vanua. David has a set of puzzle pieces. He can head back. <br/>Go to the table. Put it down. <br/>Jeff: Michaela has the fourth and final set. Start solving the puzzle. <br/>That one right there. <br/>Jeff: Huge time advantage for Takali. They have had a massive head start for a massive reward. David back with that third set of pieces for Vanua. <br/>Hurry, Zeke. You got this. This is the last puzzle piece. <br/>Jeff: Zeke back with that fourth and final set. They have a lot of time to make up. Zeke will be the puzzle solver. The only problem is the people solving the puzzle are blind  folded. <br/>She's going to faint. <br/>Why don't you come back here. Pop down in the shade. You let me know if you need medical. <br/>I’m good. <br/>Jeff: Don't hesitate to say. <br/>No, no, no. <br/>Jeff: Michelle started at a major disadvantage. It would be an impressive come-from-behind. <br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah. <br/>Jeff: Figgy and Ken have had a huge lead. Can they use it to their advantage? Michaela with Jay making some progress. <br/>Right, there right there. <br/>Jeff: Vanua was in dead last in this challenge. Michelle and Zeke giving it their best shot to catch up. <br/>Put the one in your hand, put that in the top left corner. <br/>What? Figgy trying to figure out what's not right. <br/>The whole face is...  Just relax. <br/>Jeff: Michelle and Zeke working really well together. Could be an incredible comeback. If they're right. Zeke trying to get it in. <br/>Yes, that's it! <br/>Jeff: And they're right. From behind, Vanua wins a massive reward. They're now looking for second place. <br/>I’m right here. Okay. That's going to be that one. <br/>Jeff: Now Jay and Michaela, Figgy and Ken looking for  chocolate chip cookies. Another piece for Jay. Ken moving another piece. Michaela slides another piece. <br/>Jeff, I’m done. <br/>Jeff: Jay thinks he's done. Jay is right. Ika bula wins reward, chocolate chip cookies sending Takali back  to camp empty handed after a gigantic lead. <br/>All right. You're all right, you're all right. <br/>You doing all right? <br/>I can't tell if I’m panicking  or dehydrated. <br/>Medical, dr. Joe, can we take a look at Hannah. <br/>Hannah. <br/>My arms are cramping up. <br/>All right. <br/>What's wrong with Hannah? <br/>I don't know. <br/>You're not going to let me die? <br/>Of course not. It's just because you're breathing a little bit quick. Breathe with me. Just slow it down. Nice and slow. That's it. That's it. You're getting better. <br/>Am I? <br/>Yes. You're fine. <br/>Jeff: Joe, what's happening? <br/>I think Hannah got a bit  excited during the challenge and she started breathing a little bit too  quick. If you do it without a good reason physically, then it can make  your blood go acidic. One of the symptoms is you get spasms in the wrists and the  hands. Hannah's managed to calm herself down and the symptoms have  started to resolve already. <br/>Jeff: You seem to know this, you seem to be aware of  what's happening? <br/>I knew coming out here  that I could panic or something, but I didn't want to be one of those people. <br/>Jeff: Well, if there's anything that will expose your  vulnerability, it's "Survivor." the sign of courage is that you  came out here despite being concerned about it. I'll get you some water. <br/>Thank you. Thank you, guys. How do you feel, Hannah? <br/>I feel a lot better. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. <br/>You look better. <br/>All right. Let's get to the results a massive come-from-behind victory led  by Michelle. Huge reward. Come grab it. Apple pie, cookies. Iced tea, milk. Enjoy it. Ika bula, it's not a table full. Michaela. <br/>I'll take that. <br/>Jeff: Come get it. Enjoy. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: So Figgy, it's a hero or zero role when you say I will  be the caller. What happened? <br/>It's really frustrating when you're so close and you're  the caller and you're the leader and you just... You're good at puzzles, but  it's hard to direct the blind and you hope you can and then you fail. It sucks. It's just hard. <br/>Jeff: Takali, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>Thank you to everybody. <br/>I’m so content right now. <br/>What's funny, before a deal like this, you're all like in  my way for a million dollars. It's. There and now it's like, oh, my God, we got pie. <br/>I don't think we would  have won that challenge with CeCe. <br/>I think it was 100% Michelle  solving that puzzle. <br/>And Figgy seems to really like me. <br/>That was a real slip on her part. <br/>Michelle is a very David dang player, because as Figgy  announced to the world at the challenge, I’m so happy to see Michelle, and  then, oh, and Zeke, too. It's like, hi, Michelle. It was, I love Michelle. Oh, wait, and Zeke. Hi, hi, good the see you. Obviously I’m at the bottom of the millennials. So my gut tells me that getting rid of Michelle isn't bad for  me, right, because Michelle has connections to Taylor and Figgy. <br/>Figgy honestly owes me her life in this game. I never thought I would say, this but I think to go forward, it  might be necessary for me to give up on the millennial tribe. It might be necessary for me to give up on the millennial tribe. <br/>That's fascinating. A panic attack is not a lot of panic. It's suppressed panic. And this is a game where you constantly are not addressing every  emotion. Like I already know I’m going to be made fun of by some of the  people. I can't help that I’m a person that has anxiety. Of course it's embarrassing. You're just collapsing and you're not even in the challenge. There were game thoughts of, I can't seem weak. That's the worst part, I can't seem this weak in front of my  tribe. <br/>I get it. I think we've proven to ourselves that we can do this. My brain is so exhausted. There's not a moment when you can breathe out and be like, okay,  I’m going the take five minutes for "Survivor" and take a breath. So I have to keep going. Perception is reality. I have to keep saying I’m good so that people know that I’m good,  so that it doesn't become a hindrance to my game. <br/>I’m so stoked for my coconut. I'm so stoked for my coconut. <br/>What if we just started making out if n front of you, Adam? <br/>Gross. <br/>My "Survivor" romance is growing each day, but  figs is like, don't tell jess and Ken about ourshowmance. We're a power couple, and at this point there's no reason to  hide it. Everyone else knows. <br/>Adam is on our side. <br/>I know. <br/>Can I just tell. <br/>Taylor and I are like a thing. <br/>Right now we have the numbers with Adam, but I’m worried  about coming out. <br/>Will that be weird in. <br/>Yes, it will be weird. Go do it. <br/>I don't know what type of  reaction it's going to be. <br/>I want to talk to you  about something. <br/>Okay. <br/>That's what freaks me out the most. I don't know if it's going to be a good reaction or a bad  reaction. <br/>I haven't told you this  or Ken this because I was kind of nervous, but I kind of have a thing with Taylor. <br/>Wow. You think? <br/>You really knew? <br/>You're not very good with keeping secrets. <br/>Ken, I was just telling Jessica Taylor and I have a thing. <br/>You're kidding. Really? I would not have guessed. Does that mean when I wake up in the morning and I see you  cuddling and holding hands and that's why you're constantly looking at each  other? I've been around the block, little girl. I've been around way longer than you. It's obvious. And she was shocked. She thought they had been doing a great job of hiding it. <br/>I didn't want it to be  like a secret-type thing. <br/>I appreciate you saying  something,. These kids think they're in charge of it all. They think, this is vacation, this is fun, I’m on "Survivor,"  this is awesome. But that little couple of Taylor and Figgy aren't as cool as  they think they are. I'm not going to sit on my ass an hope and pray everything is  okay. I'm going to make moves to make sure I’m okay. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: First things first, got the take back the idol. <br/>Hey, junior. <br/>Training for the big one today. <br/>Jeff: Thank you, will. Once again immoneyty is back up for grabs. For today's challenge you'll race across a series of balance  beam, collect bags of coconuts, bring them up the beach. Once you have all six bags, you'll open them to find three  balls. Two players will then maneuver those balls through a table maze. First two tribes to get all three balls to the end win immunity,  safe from the vote. Losers, tribal council, will somebody will be the sixth person  voted out of this game. Takali, you have one extra member. <br/>I'll sit out. <br/>Jeff: Adam. Ika bula, you have two extra members. Will and Sunday, take a seat on the bench. Everyone else take a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, Ken. <br/>. <br/>Jeff: It is again in the water. It is Jay in the water. It is David in the water. Ken making fast work, but he falls. Ken's got to go back. Jay's across quickly. Here comes David. <br/>There you go. <br/>You got it, David. <br/>Jeff: Now you got to get up and get three bags off. Jay untying. David and Ken trying the catch up. <br/>Go, Ken! <br/>Jeff: Jay on his first bag. Jay on his second. David has his first bag. Ken untying. <br/>Good job, Jay. Let's go. <br/>Jeff: Jay has his third and a big fall. David with his third. <br/>Nice job, David. <br/>Jeff: David's a big surprise in this challenge. It is Ken who is struggling. Jay bringing up all three bags at once. David can only bring one. But he's still got a lead over Ken. Ken now with a third bag. <br/>Gosh, that's a hard fall. <br/>Jeff: Jay back with his third bag. Go, ika bula. Ken now bringing up three bags at once, and now he's making up  time. Go, Taylor. David now dragging two bags that combined weigh more than he  does. Go! Chris now in the water for Vanua. Taylor quickly across the beam. Takali now in the lead. <br/>Push, baby, push. <br/>Jeff: Here comes Chris trying to make up the time that David  lost. Taylor scampering up quickly for the last three bags. Bret right behind him. Taylor quickly gets his first, second and third bag all at once. Bret with his third bag. <br/>You're almost there. <br/>Jeff: Once Taylor's back, you're good. Pick 'em up now. Takali has a huge lead. Here comes Bret with his final three bags. Chris now with his third. Chris is going to have to move fast to stay in this. Ken and Taylor working together quickly. They have that sixth and final bag. You're done. Go, ladies. It is now Figgy and Jessica. You have to empty all the coconuts. You're looking for three balls. Jay with his sixth bag. Get on the mat. Go in, ladies. Here comes Chris with his third bag. Michaela and Hannah doing a nice job. Go, Vanua! Michelle now untying coconuts. Takali, they've got them all. Now you're looking for three balls. Jessica and Figgy have their three balls. Still working on that maze. You have to work a very difficult table maze while having both  your feet on a very small peg. Jessica and Figgy with a huge time advantage. Michaela and Hannah have the last set. They have their three balls. Head up. Zeke on that last bag, trying to make up time. There it is. Find the balls and get up here. It is Figgy and Jessica. <br/>We got to go that way. <br/>Jeff: Michaela and Hannah. <br/>Wait. Stop moving so big. <br/>Jeff: And Zeke and Michelle for immunity. Michelle and Zeke know they've got to make up some time. Going wild out of the gate. <br/>Sorry. <br/>You're too stiff on the board. Just hold it. <br/>Michaela continues to bark orders at Hannah, making sure Hannah  knows what time it is. <br/>Jeff: All three pairs trying to figure out each other's  rhythm. Michaela and Hannah in a tough spot. You have to get around a very narrow channel. Michaela and Hannah as close as they've been. <br/>I don't need you to move  at all. <br/>I’m just holding on. Hannah and Michaela have the lead now. Jessica and Figgy close. Racing will get you nowhere but a date with me at tribal  council. <br/>Don't get frustrated. <br/>I’m not frustrated. I'm getting yelled at. <br/>I’m trying to get you to  win. I'm trying to keep us all here. Go down slightly, slightly. There you go! <br/>Jeff: Hannah and Michaela have a huge lead. Figy and Jessica very close. Figgy and Jessica drop their first ball. They have one. Michelle and Zeke, they're getting nowhere. <br/>Let me know if you need to reset. <br/>Jeff: Hannah and Michaela may not ever want to road trip  together. <br/>I love Hannah. I just need people to shut up. I need you steady. I need you steady. <br/>Jeff: They're within inches of securing immunity. <br/>Lift up slightly. <br/>Jeff: And they have it. Hannah and Michaela win immunity! Ika bula is safe. We're looking for second place. It is Jessica and Figgy versus Michelle and Zeke. They know they've got to get something going. No. <br/>Zeke, Michelle, only one person move it when you all get  past that bar. <br/>Jeff: Michaela now helping Michelle and Zeke. Stop the ball. Stop. Make it stop. Nice save. Can they get it to drop? Literally one inch away. There it is. We are tied 1-1. Now we got a challenge. Jessica and Figgy, nice save. And they drop their second. Jessica and Figgy now one ball left to secure immunity. Pressure now on Michelle and Zeke. Nice touch. Will it drop? <br/>It's going to drop. <br/>Jeff: We are tied again. 2-2. It is a race to the finish. This is it right here. If Vanua can pull this out, it would be a gigantic comeback. Nobody wants to go to tribal. Here comes Jessica and Figgy. All around it. Michelle and Zeke with a nice save. Jessica and Figgy, can they save it? No. Michelle and Zeke, they drop it for immunity. Vanua safe. Tribal council where somebody will be voted out of this game. Ika bula, congratulations. Immunity. Nobody going home from your tribe. Vanua, congratulations. Nobody going home from your tribe. So I got to ask, there was clearly some encouragement coming  from you, Michaela, toward Vanua. What's that story? <br/>Well, we want millennials to stay. When you get 2-2, somebody has to go home. <br/>There's millennials over here, but there's three of you,  if you can't figure out how to work together, you deserve to go home. <br/>Jeff: Ika bula, nobody going home. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. Takali, tribal council tonight. Somebody will be the sixth person voted out of this game. Grab your stuff, head back to camp, see you tonight at tribal. <br/>Takali tribe is going to tribal council tonight. It really blows, but if the millennials are smart, we'll stick  together and take out the gen-xers. <br/>What's up, guys? <br/>We tried. <br/>We were so close. <br/>I know. <br/>Losing puts me in a real bind, because this whole time  that I've been out here, I've been playing double agent, and it certainly  feels like if I wanted to side with Jessica and Ken that I could do that. If I wanted to sign with Figgy and Taylor, I could do that, but  no matter how I vote tonight, somebody is coming back unhappy, and I’m in a  really, rally tough position. <br/>I’m on board with you. <br/>I know. I know. I know you guys are. <br/>It's got to be Ken or Jessica. <br/>I know. Of course. <br/>Who would you rather take out? <br/>Ken. We do Ken...  I don't know. This is hard. This is so hard. <br/>I think we got to go Ken. <br/>I think so too. <br/>The plan is to take out Ken. He's a dangerous player in this game, and come merge he's going  to be a threat in challenges. <br/>I think we're on the same  page. <br/>I’m voting Ken. <br/>Yes. <br/>Okay. <br/>Tonight at tribal council, we're going to vote out Ken. <br/>Oh, dammit. Why did we lose? I hate this. <br/>But who knows, maybe Adam is double crossing us and he's  way smarter than we think he is. Unlikely, but maybe. <br/>What do you think? <br/>Can we really trust Adam right now? <br/>I don't trust anybody but  you. <br/>This sucks. <br/>What sucks? <br/>Well, if you want to work with me, let's get out Ken. He's solid, 100%. We'll vote out those two. And then it's you, me and Ken. You know what I mean? Where's your heart at right now? <br/>I don't know. <br/>I mean, are they talking Ken? <br/>Of course. <br/>Okay. <br/>Figgy and Taylor are going to vote for Ken, but clearly  this can't happen, because I need Ken to move forward. He's got my back, and I have his. And if Ken went home, I would be the next one to go. <br/>So you need to go talk to Adam and convince Adam that  you're with him 150%, otherwise he's going to put your name down. You need to convince him that you will never write his name  down. The three of us will run this game. <br/>I could be going home,  but I've never gone down without a fight. So until tribal tonight, I’m going to be fighting for this. <br/>I respect you. Jess respects you. We don't want to move forward with two conniving, arrogant kids,  so you want to sit over there with me and David and jess, or do you want to  sit over there with Taylor, fig, the cool kids knowing you are at the very  bottom. <br/>Basically what you're asking me to do is trust in people  that I've never met before. <br/>I have your back until  the end. I have you back and I will never put you name down, andly fight  for you. It's matter of who you want to move forward with, man. <br/>My mind is just reeling right now, because Ken makes  really good arguments. The question is: Which side is going to be better for my future  in this game. I mean, the whole world is probably screaming, get out the power  couple. What are you thinking? But at this point, I don't know that that makes sense for me. But at this point, I don't know that that makes sense for me. <br/>Jeff: All right. Ken, so give me the lay of the land, because just on the  surface, it's easy the say three millennials, two gen-x, one of you are going  home. <br/>Yeah, it's obvious that there's only two gen-x, so  definitely that's going to put us on the outside. <br/>Jeff: Taylor, do you gee with that, that all the  millennials are going to stick together. <br/>I would say so, yeah. I mean, if you can have a bond like that, so much is possible. <br/>Jeff: Figgy, just because you started with Taylor and Adam  doesn't mean you're going to get along with them. <br/>Yeah, everything isn't all peachy with all the  millennials. For instance, this guy over here voted for me at our first  tribal council, but I don't hold any animosity toward him. I let go of that. <br/>Jeff: Adam, Figgy says she's forgiven you for voting for  her and that she looks at you just like she would look at Taylor, we're in  this together. <br/>Well, she certainly doesn't look at me just like she would  look at Taylor, let's be very clear about that, whether you want to call it a  showmance or a romance, some kind of "Mance" is coming on. <br/>Jeff: Taylor, are you in love? <br/>I wouldn't say that. I think that's a stretch, but, no, we definitely like each  other. Young love. <br/>Jeff: Ken, have you noticed this relationship? <br/>Oh, yeah. I thought it was hilarious when they came up to me, we know you  probably didn't catch it, but just so you know, we like each other. <br/>Is that what they said. <br/>Jeff: Being that I am an ordained minister, if I were to  say to you, let's throw caution to the wind and let's get married right now,  the millennials do these things, we marry you right now, I get the license. <br/>Jeff: Let's go. <br/>Are you serious? I can't tell if you're serious. <br/>Jeff: I was just saying "Survivor" first. <br/>Jeff: Ken, when Figgy says let's go, she's waiting for you  to step in and confirm what she just said, therefore validating her feelings  and making her feel safe and secure in this well-developed two-week  relationship. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: So Figgy, you don't seem concerned that it's out in  the open. <br/>No, I mean, Taylor and I have our little thing, but we  always will say it's two people voting together. Those are two people voting together. <br/>Jeff: Jessica and Ken? <br/>Exactly. <br/>Jeff: But Adam, there would be a slight difference in Ken  and Jessica voting together because it's strategic, and Figgy and Taylor  because they like each other. <br/>Sure. <br/>Jeff: Figgy you act like that's the craziest thing you  ever heard. <br/>Yeah, we didn't come here for this. This just happened. We're still being very strategic nick every move we make. <br/>Jeff: Taylor, is it easier to be honest with your  relationship when you have the luxury of the numbers? <br/>Yes, it definitely is. If you have the numbers, we can go, you know what, this is what  it is. If people don't like it, I can just write your name down. <br/>Jeff: Wow. <br/>But numbers can change at any time in this game. So maybe it's not as black and white as gen-x and millennials. <br/>Jeff: So am dam, we have Taylor and Figgy who are a  romantic couple and Jessica and Kent who are a strategic couple that leaves  you in the middle. <br/>Yes. I think that sounds right, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: But Taylor, Adam's either sticking with this three  or he's joining Jessica and Ken. <br/>He could totally flip on us right now. But come the merge, the millennials already have the numbers,  and they could look at him and go, what are you doing, man? Boot his ass out. <br/>Jeff: You were pretty clear just then in saying, if Adam  flips on the millennials, you will boot his ass out. <br/>I think millennials as a  whole would. <br/>Jeff: Adam, that argument has to have crossed your mind. <br/>Sure, of course. Tonight is not just about tonight. I'm looking toward the future. And I would hope that whatever four comes out of tonight can be  a four. <br/>Jeff: Jessica, so if these three are staying true, there's  very little for you to do. <br/>I was surprised there was  contentiousness within that tribe. If you make the merge, it's still going to be there. <br/>Jeff: Figgy, that got a reaction from you? <br/>I feel like it's  tug-of-war right now. <br/>Jeff: Over Adam? <br/>Yeah. Almost. It's just like, you have to remember where the numbers lie. <br/>Jeff, I have one more thing to say, which is the person I’m  voting for tonight, I genuinely like. It's going to be difficult. Someone is going to go home upset tonight, and someone is going  to go back to camp upset tonight. <br/>Jeff: All right. Time to vote. Taylor, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote Ken. Figgy. Ken. Two votes Ken. Figgy. We're tied, two votes Ken, two votes Figgy, one vote left. Sixth person voted out of "Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen-x," Figgy. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>I'll explain if I can. <br/>Jeff: Figgy, the tribe has spoKen. Time for you to go. <br/>Good luck, tay. <br/>Jeff: Well, it was said tonight, somebody will be voted  out and somebody will go back the camp unhappy. The question becomes how do you deal with it? Grab your torch, head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor," a love-scorned Taylor...  I lied to you and I screwed  you. <br/>Jeff: Seeks vengeance. <br/>I will industry you. <br/>But a new power couple begins to form. <br/>Zeke, I trust you a lot. <br/>I found the idol. <br/>Oh, my goodness. He has put his life in my hands. <br/>I came in here guns  blazing. I guess it's more of a compliment to be taken out now, otherwise  I would have taken out every single one of them. I'm not disappointed in my game, but I’m bummed that I don't get  to be around Taylor. We'll probably be reunited one day, but just not any time soon.
