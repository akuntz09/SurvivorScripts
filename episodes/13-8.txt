<br/>JEFF Probst: previously on Survivor...  You snapped at me twice. <br/>I said you were annoying. <br/>Adam and Christina had it out. <br/>You said I annoyed you. <br/>It's your personality. <br/>Well, you could have said something to me. I never thought that's what they thought of me. <br/>Probst: At the challenge... Good news, bad news. The good news is the winners will feast. The bad news is you'll be feasting at tribal council. <br/>Ooh! <br/>Probst: Go! Aitu endured the physical test... Jonathan and Yul taking on Nate. ...and gave Raro a beating. Aitu wins the challenge! Here's how it's going to work tonight. Aitu will go to tribal council first. You will vote somebody out. You will then enjoy your feast while listening in on Raro's tribal council. On Raro...  Would you give me a chance tonight? <br/>Probst: Christina scrambled to save herself. <br/>I had no idea. I'm very sorry. I'm trying to talk to some people. And hopefully I won't get booted out tonight. <br/>Probst: Back at Aitu...  I'm going to find a way to defeat him. <br/>Probst: Thinking Jonathan had the hidden immunity idol, Cao Boi dreamed up  Plan Voodoo. <br/>We force the idol out. <br/>I think the plan is ingenious. I know neither Jonathan nor Candice have the hidden immunity idol, because I  have it. <br/>Probst: But at tribal council... The sixth person voted out of Survivor: Cook  Islands... Cao Boi's Plan Voodoo folded, and his wildcard personality finally  caught up with him... Cao Boi, the tribe has spoken. ...and he was voted out. Well, the hard part's over. Now for the fun. Aitu enjoyed a succulent spread...  People in our group plain out said, "You're annoying."  Probst: ...while listening in on Raro's brutal honesty about Christina. <br/>Unfortunately, she just found out our true feelings. <br/>Probst: But before the vote, another surprise was revealed. Aitu, you will now kidnap one member from the Raro tribe. They will be a part of your tribe through the next reward challenge. Aitu, who are you going to kidnap? <br/>Nate. <br/>Probst: Aitu kidnapped Nate... Seventh person voted out of the Cook Islands...  ...and Christina was voted out. 13 are left. 13 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK  TELEVISION TELEVISION  I imagine this camp is nicer than your camp. <br/>You guys have more space, I'll say. But it seems like we've got, like, more hibiscus and more coconuts. What a twist. The Aitutaki guys have kidnapped me to come over for the night. I took it as an honor. You know, you think I'm a good competitor, thank you. <br/>Are you a good swimmer? Are you a good...  Yeah. <br/>You're a good swimmer, runner, sprinter. <br/>They started, like, sweating me out, asking me all these questions. Like, just feeding some nuts, you know, not hating. Stuff that really doesn't matter, I think, in the game. There are a lot of obstacles which make it easy and it feeds a lot of meat in  those, a lot of meat. I'm always playing the game, so, you know, just... I've got my eyes open very  much, eyes and ears, to the tenth. <br/>We had to get rid of Cao Boi. Obviously, that part sucked, you know? <br/>Yeah, I just wish I was clued in on what was going on, because now I kind of  feel, like, nervous. I'd rather be on the same page and know what's going on than not. Just be, you know, clued in. The vote knocked me off my socks for a moment. You know everyone was blindsiding me by saying, "No, no, we're going  with, you know, this other plan." And I just wasn't expecting, you know,  it to be Cao Boi at that point. I just don't want it to be me this next time, so I'm trying to figure out  where people are at. I totally had voted for Jonathan, but I'm trying to get a clue on what's  going to happen next kind of thing. <br/>I played my cards right. I got me some good info right now. It was like, "Oh, thanks, more info." So I'm going to take my  little notepad and I'm going to go back to my tribe and let them know what's  going on so that we can make some moves and really battle it out. <br/>Flicka's going crazy right now. She's like, "I want to be in on the planning with you." So we need  to come up with a story. <br/>The thing I don't like is that she's been doing it in front of Nate, right? <br/>Like, that whole conversation happened right in front of Nate. And I'm like...  But we have to know our top three. <br/>To vote off? <br/>I feel most comfortable if we have a third, just because, you know, within  our five we don't want to just blow up. <br/>I mean, I think we should stay with the same plan, but in terms of order it  would be Ozzy, Flicka, right, followed by...  Who would you rather compete in individual immunity, Sundra or Jonathan? <br/>Jonathan before Sundra? <br/>Yeah. Oh, yeah. <br/>I'm going to go back. <br/>Originally the order of getting voted out was Ozzy would be next, followed by  Flicka, followed by Sundra, and then it would be the remaining four. But we feel like we're starting to get to the point where a merge is  imminent, so now there's been talk about, well, if we come down to it, do we  vote off Jonathan before we vote off Sundra? He'd be a tough person to go up against in an individual against in an  individual competition. competition. <br/>Okay, here we go. You guys ready? "Swim, fly, dive, think. Either way, you are in the drink. Browse this catalog and just pick two. And they could be yours by the time you're through." It's a  Survivorcatalog! <br/>Oh! <br/>Page one, check this out. <br/>Page one, page one. <br/>A collection of oil and spices. Sewing kit. <br/>The tree mail was awesome. It was a catalog. We got to choose two items that if we win the reward today we get to have. <br/>You guys vote for what you want to vote for, okay? It's a democracy. <br/>Peanut butter. <br/>That's eight votes. <br/>I think potatoes. Do you want bread? It's ultimately...  What right now? <br/>What do you want? <br/>I'm just being rational. <br/>Peanut butter and bread. <br/>I want bread, too. <br/>You think about, like, challenges next week, you definitely need that  carbohydrate. I had wanted a bag of potatoes and then peanut butter, trying to be the voice  of reason. <br/>Couldn't we just have bread? <br/>It won't last as long, but...  You could make a peanut butter sandwich. <br/>You can have potatoes with seafood next week. <br/>Three against two, though. I mean, guys, I don't know...  Okay, whatever. That's fine. Okay, so put bread. I was trying to think the longevity of the tribe, but I've got to do what the  majority got to do what the majority votes, right? votes, right? <br/>Probst: Aitu, Raro, come on  Probst: Aitu, Raro, come on in! in! All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Here's how it works. Each tribe will select three swimmers and two puzzle makers. On my "go," the first swimmer will grab a club, swim out to a  platform, climb to the top, and then leap off of the platform. While in midair, you will smash a plaster box, releasing a key. You'll then dive down, retrieve the key, swim back to shore. You'll continue doing this until you have retrieved six keys. Each swimmer must swim out at least one time. And each swimmer can only retrieve one key at a time. The two puzzle makers will then use those six keys to open six locks on a  chest. Inside the chest, puzzle pieces. First tribe to assemble a puzzle map of the world wins reward. Raro, here's what you picked to play for. Bread and peanut butter. Aitu, here's what you picked. Bag of potatoes and peanut butter. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Okay, Aitu, you have to sit three people out. Who are you sitting out? Jessica, Sundra, Nate. So you take Nate to keep him from competing with Raro, but you don't trust  him to compete with your tribe. Is that what I'm reading? Nate, you'll rejoin your Raro tribe after this challenge. <br/>Awesome. <br/>Probst: One more part of the reward. In addition, the winning tribe will choose one member from the losing tribe  to go to Exile Island. I'll give you a minute to figure out who your swimmers are going to be, and  we'll get started. <br/>I'd rather do puzzle. I can do puzzles like the back I can do puzzles like the back of my hand. of my hand. <br/>Probst: All right, the swimmers for Aitu-- Ozzy, Candice, and Yul. The swimmers for Raro-- Rebecca, Parvati, and Adam. For reward, survivors ready. Go! Ozzy and Rebecca first in the water. Ozzy tosses his club. Not going to bother swimming with it, throws it out ahead. Rebecca quickly falling behind. Big lead for Aitu right off the bat. Ozzy smashes the box and the key drops. Now he's got to find it. Rebecca still working her way toward the platform. Ozzy has the key and he's swimming back. <br/>Go, Ozzy! Go, Ozzy! <br/>Probst: Rebecca can hardly get up on the platform. <br/>Ozzy! <br/>Probst: Ozzy back with the first key. Yul heads out for Aitu. Rebecca finally up on the platform. Yul swimming out for Aitu. Rebecca's got to find the key. Rebecca's heading back without a key. <br/>Come on, Yul! <br/>Probst: Yul at the platform for Aitu. Rebecca really struggling in the water. Yul has the second key for Aitu. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Yul gaining on Rebecca. He's about to lap her. <br/>Brad, why aren't you swimming? <br/>Because I'm better at puzzles. <br/>Probst: Yul back with the second key. Candice heading out for Aitu. Aitu with two keys, Raro no keys. <br/>Pull your top down, baby. <br/>Probst: Rebecca does not have a key for Raro. <br/>Your bathing suit! <br/>Probst: Got to get back to tag out, Rebecca. Candice now at the platform for Aitu. Rebecca exhausted. Adam's got a lot of time to make up. Adam has to find Rebecca's key that is in the water somewhere. <br/>All right, Candice, let's go, girl, you got it! <br/>Probst: Adam looking for Rebecca's key. Candice now looking for her key. Adam has the key for Raro. Candice cannot find her key. This is a break that Raro needs. Parvati heading out. <br/>I can't find it! <br/>Come back! <br/>Probst: Candice heading back without a key. It's going to cost them a lot of time. Aitu leads two keys to one. <br/>There you go! <br/>Probst: And that knocks the key out. Candice exhausted. Ozzy back in the water for Aitu. Parvati looking for her key. Ozzy needs to make sure Candice's key fell out. <br/>It's still in the box! <br/>Use your fist! <br/>Probst: He doesn't have a club. He's going to do it with his fist. <br/>All right! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Parvati has the second key for Raro. <br/>That's what I'm talking about! <br/>Probst: Ozzy coming back with the third key for Aitu. <br/>Ozzy! <br/>Probst: Aitu now has their third key. Yul in the water for Aitu. Adam back in the water for Raro. Aitu leads three keys-two. Yul at the platform. Adam at the platform for Raro. Yul cannot find his key for Aitu. Adam has the third key for Raro. Yul has the fourth key for Aitu. He's heading back. Raro gaining ground. <br/>Good job, Adam! <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Probst: Parvati heading out again. Yul coming back. Aitu leads four keys three. Parvati could make up some time for Raro. Parvati has the fourth key for Parvati has the fourth key for Raro. Raro. Candice comes up with the key right away. Parvati back with the fourth key. Adam back in the water for Raro. Candice out of the water with the fifth key. <br/>You've got this. <br/>All right! <br/>Probst: Ozzy heading out for the sixth and final key. Adam whacks it, and the key is in the water. Adam has the fifth key. Raro making up ground! Ozzy smashes the box. Key is in the water. Raro has not given up. Adam back with the fifth key. Parvati back in water. Raro with one key left. Ozzy out of the water with the final key for Aitu. <br/>All right, Ozzy! <br/>Yeah, baby, yeah! <br/>Probst: Jonathan and Becky now have six keys and six locks to open. Parvati breaks the box. The key did not fall! Becky and Jonathan have the locks open, opening the chest. Parvati back up for a second hit at her box. Jonathan and Becky not finding it as easy as they had hoped. Parvati has the key for Raro. You've got to keep moving, Parvati! Becky excited-- she's figured a piece of the puzzle out. <br/>Don't give up, Parvati. <br/>Probst: Becky's figured out two pieces. Suddenly Aitu figuring out the puzzle. Parvati back with the final key for Raro. Aitu very close. Aitu very close. Aitu wins reward! Aitu wins reward! Nate, your time with Aitu is over. You can head back to Raro. <br/>Bye, Nate. Thank you. <br/>Probst: Aitu, you are sending one person from Raro to Exile Island. Who's it going to be? <br/>Adam. <br/>Adam. <br/>Adam. <br/>Probst: No hesitation-- Adam. You've been chosen to go to You've been chosen to go to Exile Island. Exile Island. Raro, sadly, I've got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head on back to camp. Aitu, come get your reward. Aitu, come get your reward. <br/>Candice, go get it. <br/>Candice, go get it. <br/>Smooth or crunchy? <br/>Smooth. <br/>You guys, I'm in love with everybody that I can see right now. If anybody wants a kiss, just come over here. I love you. [ laughter]  Got to love that. <br/>Oh, the sweet taste of peanut butter. I mean, I haven't tasted peanut butter that tasted so good in my life. <br/>Peanut butter kisses for everybody. <br/>I hope that we continue to grow as a tribe and, you know, maybe work some  things out, and who knows? Things just change constantly in this game, and you never really this game,  and you never really know what's going to happen. know what's going to happen. know what's going to happen. <br/>Right? <br/>Right? <br/>My team really could have used me today. They really could have used me. For me, it's frustrating because I couldn't do anything. I couldn't compete. I'm a good swimmer. <br/>The only reason I sat out because I really felt like we needed... we kept  choking at the...  We needed you swimming, brother. <br/>The thing is, we always choke at the very end. And I feel like... I mean, puzzles... I can... I'm creative spatial. I do puzzles. Like, I get puzzles. I look at something and I can...  I think...  But you're right, we did need a strong...  We needed another guy swimming. For Brad to take the back seat today and want to be puzzle boy when we have a  swimming challenge, pissed me off. I don't know what his deal was. Maybe he didn't want to get wet. Maybe he was cold. Maybe he's a Nancy boy. I do not know what he was thinking, but he did not get his ass up and swim. We needed him there. I don't care about no stupid puzzle. "I'm good at puzzles. I'm real..." I don't care about I'm real..." I don't care about  that nonsense. that nonsense. <br/>He know he's one of our best swimmers. He knows that. He's like, "What's best for the team." How hard is it to do a  puzzle? <br/>That really pissed, me off because Rebecca was cashed. I don't know why he insisted on the puzzle. I want to punch him in the mouth. I'm so angry right now. I'm like... God, that was miserable today. <br/>Now we've got a storm coming from Lord knows what. It's cold. And I got to come out here and fish and go back and get wood, and the girls  are burned out, so I want them to rest. It's like, thanks for the lovely It's like, thanks for the lovely way to come  home, you know? way to come home, you know? <br/>I'm not happy to be back at Exile Island. I am starting to doubt my tribe. Challenge after challenge, they just don't come through. You know, it's hard to soar like an eagle when you're like an eagle when  you're surround by turkeys. surround by turkeys. <br/>It hurts to be out here. The actual rain with the wind, it kills you. I was pretty much just in a fetal position. fetal position. I hoped that it would go away. I hoped that it would go away. I hoped that it would go away. <br/>I caught a bird. <br/>I caught a bird. <br/>Wow. <br/>What do you guys want to do with it? <br/>Kill it quick, if you're going to eat it. It's suffering. <br/>It's not suffering. I'm holding it firmly. <br/>You could let it go and it could go away. <br/>Eat it. <br/>We should probably eat it. <br/>That's why you caught it-- eat it. <br/>Yul? <br/>Eat it. <br/>Eat it. <br/>Yul, get up. <br/>Yul, get up. <br/>I went to go to the bathroom and it was in the bushes sleeping. And I just crept up on it. <br/>It's about as big as a chicken. All right, I'll pluck it. <br/>Good job, man. Good job, Yul. Good job, Oz. <br/>Good morning! <br/>Well, then...  All right, good. Let's... let's respect it and eat it and enjoy it and get nourishment from it. Cool. <br/>Ozzy is amazing. He's like half animal, half man, you know, part fish, part monkey part the  lord knows what. <br/>Will you make me a tree fort? He's so high up there right now. <br/>He's kind of like the little jungle boy, you know, climbing these coconut  trees and getting coconuts down, getting fish. <br/>Almost the colors of the rainbow. <br/>I mean, coming up with this bird. I mean, Ozzy... [ sighs] [ sighs] ...he's just Ozzy. ...he's just Ozzy. <br/>The guy is surprising. I mean, I underestimated him. He provides a lot of food, but, you know, at the same time, ultimately, we  feel that we should get rid of him while we still have the control rather  than wait for a merge and potentially have him dominate some of the  individual challenges. <br/>So what do you think is going to happen? <br/>I have to get my butt in here. Okay. <br/>We need a plan. <br/>What kind of plan? <br/>I need to just know what's happening. What's going to...  I don't know. I don't...  What happens, though, like, say, okay, we did have to go to tribal council  and we did have to vote someone out? <br/>I don't know. What do you guys think? <br/>Well, the biggest issue, the number one issue, is none of us trust Jonathan. He's just always... the gears are always turning with him, and it kind of  makes us uneasy. <br/>I think that we could honestly make the strongest alliance, because you two  are the strongest girls, and I don't... I don't...  Three doesn't make anything. <br/>Yeah, but we... I think we could work it. <br/>I don't think... I don't think... it doesn't work out when you say it like  that, but if there's two other people, like Yul and Becky that were also...  or if it was us and Sundra. But I just want you to know if you want to, I mean, you can trust me. And if I do end up leaving, if some strategy works out and I get voted off,  then what are you guys going to eat? I think I'm a more valuable player than Jonathan at this point. He can't provide for people. So if they get rid of me, where is that going to leave them? It's going to start getting to that point where food is going to become an  issue for everybody. I might be more of a threat, but the people that do stick with me, they're  going to be able to me, they're going to be able to enjoy a ride. enjoy a ride. enjoy a ride. <br/>Probst: come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Adam, returning from Exile Island. <br/>How's everyone doing? Give me a hug. Come on. Good to see you. <br/>How you doing? <br/>Probst: Adam, I think it's safe to say you had the worst night anybody's ever  had on Exile. <br/>It was extremely rough there, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Tell me about the storm. We all felt it. <br/>It was tough. I mean, it was raining pretty hard. It was hitting me on the back, it was stinging me. You know, I was just shivering all night. I was in pain. It was rough. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: First things first, Yul. Take back immunity. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, each tribe will race to arrange a series of logs from  shortest to tallest as you build a staircase to the top of the tower. Three tribe members will sail down a zipline into the water, retrieve a bag  of puzzle pieces, swim back to shore. Then the next person goes. The three remaining tribe members will use those pieces to solve a puzzle. The first tribe to solve their puzzle correctly wins immunity, guaranteed a  one in 12 shot at a million dollars. Losers, tribal council tonight, somebody will be voted out. Aitu, because you have one extra member, you're sitting somebody out. You cannot sit out the same people in back-to-back challenges. Sundra and Jessica sat out the last challenge. Who is it going to be this time? <br/>I am. <br/>Probst: Jonathan, take a spot over here. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Probst: I'll give you a few minutes to strategize, and we'll minutes to  strategize, and we'll get started. get started. Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready? Go! Logs are heavy. Some people carrying, others dragging. Everybody working. Building a staircase from shortest to tallest. Got to figure out the order. Ozzy and Yul think they have the tallest log. <br/>This one's taller. <br/>Why don't you pick it up and put it next to it? <br/>Probst: Women doing a lot of the work for Raro. They're building it from the bottom up while the guys debate which is the  longest log. The key is that you put these in the right order. You're just making more work. <br/>That's it! <br/>Probst: Aitu getting the hang of it now. <br/>That's great. <br/>Probst: The quicker you get this built, the quicker you get to the top. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Ozzy puts in the last log. Aitu has it. <br/>Go, guys! That's it! <br/>Probst: Once all six to the top, go! Yul first down the zipline for Aitu. <br/>Hang on! <br/>Help me out. Help me out. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Yul in the water. Raro has it! Raro up the staircase. Yul has the bag and he's swimming back. Got to get up here, Nate. Go! Go! Brad, first down the zipline. Brad, first down the zipline. Brad into the water. Brad has his bag. He's swimming back. Aitu with a bit of a lead. <br/>That throwing is excellent. <br/>Let's go, Brad! <br/>Probst: Yul back for Aitu. Once he's on the mat, go, Candice! Candice down the zipline for Aitu. Going as fast as she can. Candice goes deep on the zipline, drops herself right at the bag. Brad's got to get back to the mat. Parvati ready to go. <br/>Go as far as you can. <br/>Probst: Go! <br/>Swing your body. Swing! <br/>Probst: Parvati getting some momentum. She's in a full tuck. Parvati in the water now. Parvati has a bag for Raro. She's swimming back. Candice swimming back for Aitu. Aitu still with the lead. Ozzy ready to go. Once she hits the mat, go, Ozzy! Ozzy swinging. In a monkey pose. Parvati swimming back. Let's go, Parvati! What are you doing walking? Raro losing more time on the swimming leg again. Ozzy swimming like a dolphin as he makes up time. <br/>Come on Pavarti! Push it Pavarti, push it! You got it! <br/>Probst: Parvati is back. Go, Nate. Nate down the zipline. Nate imitating Ozzy. Nate in the water. He's got the final bag of puzzle pieces for Raro. <br/>Here comes the puzzle! Go! <br/>Probst: Up the ladder! <br/>Come on, Nate. You're making great time, Nate! Come on, Nate! <br/>You guys are doing great. Go, Yully! <br/>Probst: Yul back with two bags of puzzle pieces. Everybody's got to be up. Start on the puzzle. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Aitu working on the puzzle. Nate coming back for Raro. <br/>Be ready! <br/>Probst: Got to climb up the rope ladder. <br/>Go, go, go, go, go! <br/>Probst: Raro back with the first bag. Here's the second bag. Nate coming up with the third bag. Start working on the puzzle. <br/>No, this has to be right here. <br/>Probst: Aitu getting it together. Becky, Sundra, Jessica working well together. Raro making good progress quickly. <br/>Santa Maria, okay. <br/>Probst: Adam, Jenny, Rebecca, working well on the puzzle. We're neck and neck on the puzzle. It's going to come down to the puzzle-building portion of this challenge. Immunity on the line. Raro getting very close. <br/>Here, here! Here! Here! Here! Here! <br/>Probst: Raro wins immunity! <br/>Probst: Raro wins immunity! <br/>Probst: Raro, congratulations. No tribal council tonight, nobody going home. Aitu, not good news for you. Tribal council tonight. One of you going home. You have the afternoon to figure out who that's going to be. Grab your stuff, head back to Grab your stuff, head back to camp, see you at  tribal. camp, see you at tribal. <br/>You know, it's a tough break. I mean, what are we going to do? It's not like they handed us our asses, you know what I mean? It's not like the way we beat them the other day where it was just ridiculous. It was just one of those things. <br/>Challenge sucked. We lost. I feel bummed out that someone has to go home. And if it ends up being me that goes home, that's how it happens. But I don't think it's going to be me. I think it's going to be somebody else. <br/>So have you thought about who you would want to vote out if we end up having  to? <br/>I don't know. <br/>Honestly? <br/>No, I don't know. It's just one of those things where Jonathan is the biggest threat for all of  us. <br/>There's been a debate between Jessica, Jonathan, and Ozzy who we should send  home first. You know, Ozzy does bring home a lot of food, and he does perform really well  in the challenges for us. Jessica drives people crazy just with, you know, the constant paranoia. And Jonathan, I think, is kind of on the cusp in our alliance, just because  from the very beginning people said they don't trust him, they're not sure,  trust him, they're not sure, blah, blah, blah. blah, blah, blah. <br/>She's trying to be everybody's friend right now, and I think Jessica is just  covering her ass. She was like a mosquito that She was like a mosquito that won't die. won't die. <br/>Ozzy, he's awesome in challenges, and I think today, also, was a very  important indicator, the fact that Jonathan sat out today. You know, obviously, we lost, but at the same time, in, like, the big  picture, we didn't, like, really need him, per se. So I thought that was also brought up by Ozzy, saying that, you know, if we  can all vote against him in the sense of... you know, if none of us trust you  know, if none of us trust him, why is he still here? him, why is he still here? <br/>That was the roughest it's been out there. Crazy. Hi. <br/>I don't know if you're feeling the funky vibe in camp, but we are trying to  get the hell out. <br/>Oh, god. I felt bad. You know, I mean, it's... it's the decision, you know? Do we think it's going to go one or two more challenges before the merge? In which case it might make sense to keep Ozzy around. I mean, he really does do well in the challenges. You know, there's just no denying it. And so maybe... maybe the choice is Flicka, and we'll just take our chances  in the individuals, you know? For all my overthinking, yes, it my bite me in the butt. People already think that I'm thinking too much, playing too much, or  whatever. I'm trying to choose my battles carefully. I'm trying to stay one step ahead of the competition. I may trip because I'm running too far, too fast ahead. All the girls agree that voting her off first is better. I can only play the game as best I can, make sense to me. And my feeling always is, if I've thought of it, somebody I've thought of it,  somebody else has thought of it. else has thought of it. <br/>I know that Jonathan for some reason seems to inspire some level of mistrust  among pretty much everybody. If you talk to anybody, including other people in our alliance, they feel like  he's a gamer. He's here to play hard, and people don't fully trust him. And for me, I haven't seen it, but because everyone else is suspicious of  him, I mean, it can't help but rub off on me a little bit. <br/>Well, you guys, for what it is, I thank you for being up front and honest  with everything today. As much as it's worth, you know, even though it's coming down and nobody  really knows what they want to do, or whatever. I don't know for sure who is voting with me for Jonathan. I would like to say Ozzy is. I would like it say the girls are, and Yul, too. But I think they're just kind of like, "I don't know what to do,"  because, you know, any of us can because, you know, any of us can go. go. <br/>Probst: Jonathan, when we started this game 18 days ago, you were divided  into groups based on ethnicity. Look at this group tonight. At least one member from all four of the original ethnic groups, and yet I  don't have any sense that that plays any part in this tribe. Surprise you? <br/>No. I think it's the game of Survivor. We're all here to play it. You divided us into four equal groups. We made the connections that we made. We were merged into two other tribes. And all those connections have either held or gone away based on personality,  not ethnicity. <br/>Probst: Sundra, is it true that there's just a natural way you tend to bond  with certain people and maybe not bond with others? <br/>Absolutely. You can't plan who you're going to bond with. It's nothing calculated or planned, and there are certain people, their personalities,  you're just not going to gel. You can force it, but it's going to be more work than with somebody who you  just find a natural chemistry with. And for those you may not get along as well with, you try to find a common  ground, you know, whatever it may be. <br/>Probst: Jessica, let's talk about who gets along with whom. <br/>Just in general, we all get along with each other. But, I mean, we all have, like, friendships, you know, that we hang out a lot. I like to go out fishing with Ozzy and, you know, the girls do the things in  camp. You know, Jonathan and Yul, they like to go out clamming. We all kind of picked our roles a little bit, but we switched things up a  lot, too. So I think all of us are capable of mixing and matching and having fun. <br/>Probst: Yul, from a strictly strategic point of view, every time I've asked  Jessica a question it's been the most delightful answer with absolutely  nothing said about how it would impact the game. <br/>It's nice to have someone like that because they're not going to be a threat. They're not going to be someone who's going to be undermining you,  outscheming you, out to get you or stab you in the back. So, you know, they're someone who you can take at face value. And as long as you can form a bond with them, they're not to be someone  you're going to have to watch out for in the future. <br/>Probst: Ozzy, it's been brought up a lot that you're a provider. Is there a point in the game where you provide too much, where you become a  threat? <br/>God, I hope not. I hope I can make everyone fat. I've never been in a position of being the hunter, and that's kind of nice to  know that I hold that little bit of responsibility in my hand. And, you know, if that ends up being my demise, then that's probably the best  way that I could see to go out in this game. <br/>Probst: Okay, if somebody does have the hidden immunity idol, and it turns  out you need to play it, you would present it to me after the vote. You would then be immune, and the person with the next highest number of  votes would be sent home. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Ozzy, you're up. Ozzy, you're up. <br/>I really admire your spirit, and I think with another group of people you  would have felt more comfortable. more comfortable. Good luck. Good luck. <br/>I didn't trust you before,  I didn't trust you before, and I'm not going to start now. and I'm not going to start now. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the vote are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Jonathan. Flicka. One vote Jessica, one vote Jonathan. Jessica. Two votes Jessica, one vote Jonathan. Jessica. That's three votes Jessica, one vote Jonathan. Eighth person voted out of the Cook Islands, Jessica. That's four. That's enough. Unless you have the hidden immunity idol, you need to bring immunity idol,  you need to bring me your torch. me your torch. Jessica, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Time for you to go. <br/>Probst: Time for you to go. Well, after 18 days, we have two tribes, each with six members. And the big question centers around momentum. You think you have it. I guarantee you Raro thinks they have it. Time will tell. Grab your torches, head back to camp. camp. Good night. Good night.

I don't know what's going on with Brad. I lost my trust with him. <br/>Probst: But a surprise twist could change everything. You have ten seconds to decide whether or not you want to change your fate in  this game. change your fate in this game. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>It's been an adventure of a lifetime, and I couldn't have asked for anything  more. I guess I wasn't playing the game as hard as I should have, but it's really  hard for me to change who I am when I just want to be myself. Ozzy, good luck. I'll be rooting for you, brother. And memories have been made that I will never forget, and I'm so I will never  forget, and I'm so thankful for those  experiences.
