<br/>Where were Wendy and Keith? <br/>Did they quit? <br/>Maybe they decided to go home. <br/>They're still at extinction. <br/>After my first tribal there were two idiots, one was Joe,  the next one was me. We were the only two out of the original cambo Kama that were in  dark about tonight's vote, so it pretty much suction right now. <br/>If I have to work with Kama and play nice, I can do, that  but I have no allegiances. I don't care where I go at this point, but I am only going with  the numbers. <br/>Seriously. <br/>Can I have a hug? <br/>Thank you. Thank you! <br/>By saving David and Rick, they trust me. They're loyal. They owe me a major one. <br/>I had three votes. I thought so. That's what I figured. <br/>Not only did they want to do it. They were evil about it. Like, no remorse whatsoever. I really wanted Rick and David to be so angry with the members  of Lesu, because I didn't want them for a second to think about going back  and work with them, and the cavern I have built with Lesu is so stRong,  they're not going to cross. It. If we just stay the course, three votes from now, you know where  that puts you? <br/>Family visit. <br/>Hopefully. <br/>I can't wait to be loyal with you guys. <br/>They made us go against each other. <br/>It is. <br/>It is Aurora. Right now we need each other for the next two votes. Otherwise, we're all done. If we patch those wounds with devyns and David, it may bring Aurora  in, weak say-- maybe we can go to rocks. We can gamble on rocks. If we don't go to rocks, we're going home anyway. <br/>20 more days and counting. 19 left to go. Stupid game. I love it so much. Damn, it gets harder. <br/>Just trying to keep it all together. That's all you gotta do, just keep it-- keep it together. Figure it out. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! All right, let's get to today's reward challenge. For today's challenge, you're going to race through a series of  obstacles, retrieve the bag of puzzle pieces, then race to the finish. You'll then use them to solve a puzzle. Do you want to know what you're playing for? Chinese take out, waiting for you back at camp. It's look a wednesday night back home watching  "Survivor." order in. Losers, nothing. We're going to do a random draw. We'll get started. Let's do it. All right, we have our two teams. For reward, here we go, Survivors ready? Go! First pair, Gavin and Wentworth and Wardog and erik for blue. Got to get to that platform. <br/>Come oerik! <br/>Jeff: Erik gets to the platform first. Gaffen now there. <br/>Come on, Wardog. <br/>Jeff: Wardog right behind. Here comes Wentworth. Both have to be at the crows nest buffer can climb that ladder. Go yellow. Gblue. It's erik going up to untie, Gavin going up to untie for yellow. <br/>Good job, erik. <br/>You guys are doing good. <br/>Jeff: Erik with the first puzzle planks for blue. <br/>Good job! <br/>Good job. Go, Wardog, go! Good job, boys! <br/>Jeff: Gavin has his puzzle plank. Let's go! <br/>Go, go, go! Come on! <br/>Jeff: Gaffeip in the water. Here comes Wentworth. Gotta get them back to shore. <br/>Come on, Wardog, let's go! Good hustle, guys. <br/>Come on, let's go. <br/>Jeff: Go, blue! It is Aurora and devins in the water for blue. <br/>Good job, devin. <br/>Go, yellow! Lauren in the water with Julie. They've got some time to make up. Blue in the early lead now. Aurora crossing the beam. It's going to be Aurora going up up to untie that second bag of  puzzle planks. <br/>Come oJulie! <br/>Jeff: Julie taking a while to get up. Every second you lose could be the second you need. <br/>Come on, Julie! <br/>Jeff: You're good. Go, yellow! Huge time advantage right now for blue as Aurora has her planks  free. You're good, jump. Aurora in the water, just misses the planks. Devin is in the water. He has to swim back to shore now. It's going to be Julie untying the knots. <br/>Come oyellow! You're doing great! <br/>Jeff: You're good. Puzzle makers take over. It's going to be Victoria and Julia now have to untie each bag  and get them in the because of puzzle. Yellow has their second batch of puzzle planks. <br/>Just put it under that-- yeah. <br/>Jeff: Julia and Victoria way big lead root now. Can they take advantage of it? You're good, yellow. Puzzle makers, take over. It's going to be David and ryan working on the puzzle. <br/>Victoria, the third from the top is number one. <br/>I can't-- I'm not tall enough. <br/>Jeff: Julia and Victoria having to work together. These are heavy pieces of wood. You have to use both players to get it in. <br/>It's higher than that. It's higher than that. <br/>Just put it in. <br/>Jeff: David and Ron trying to get back in it. <br/>Julia, this one is top. <br/>Jeff: Julia and viktorria, they are take a long time  figuring this puzzle out. Here comes David and Ron with their last plank. They have done a nice job of closing that time gap now. Julia and Victoria starting to pick up the pails. They are getting the hang of this. We are very close right now. David wedged in there, can't get it out. <br/>David, the one above it. <br/>Get this, get this! <br/> Jeff: David and Ron going to switch sides now. <br/>There you go, perfect, perfect. <br/>Jeff: Victoria and Julia slowly figuring this puzzle out, plank  by plank. <br/>Julia, are you killing it. <br/>Ron, pull yours out! Switch it! <br/>Jeff: Yellow doing a lot of yelling at each other. They have hit a roadblock. <br/> Julia thinks they are one board away weapon are they? Big reward on the line. Victoria and Julia think they have it, and they do! Aurora, erik, devins, Wardog, Julia, and Victoria, chinese  takeout waiting for them back at camp. <br/>Sorry. <br/>So we lost. Everyone's upset, but I'm sitting back thinking this is awesome. Because the last thing I want is for Wentworth and Lauren to be  stRong. I want them to be lost and lonely because I'm the puppet master. I'm trying to break them down. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Good reward, you guys! <br/>This is so good, you guys. <br/>This is best chinese food I've ever had in my whole life. <br/>I'm so happy right now. Guys, I know I just met you a new days ago and this might be  fast, but I love you guys. <br/>We love you! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>I feel so bad because I now know what it feels like to  lose a reward. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We have not won a damn thing. <br/>No. <br/>Do you know what would be awesome? If a chicken walked through this camp right now and just sat  here. <br/>Oh, God. It's like, "Hey, guys, I heard what happened at the  challenge. Eat me."  Y just needed some sort of food, and some sort of win. I am so freaking hungry. <br/>We killed that food. <br/>Good reward, guys! That was a good one! <br/>I feel like I am cursed. Like, can't win anything. <br/>I just want to apologize for voting for you last night. <br/>No, no, no. Hey, and I'm sorry, too. <br/>Yeah, all good. At this point, I'm kind of on the bottom with Wardog and Lauren. I don't know where Rick and David stand completely. But we've got to bury the hatchet. It's dumb. The leser group is totally going after each other and forgetting  there is this whole Kamaization swaigz. It's what Kama wants to run the game. If the Lesu five come together and pull in...-- the Lesu five  come together and pull in Aurora, we have six people to try and vote one of  these Kama people out. Here's the deal-- you know how this game works. Either we come together and try to take one of them out, or  we're probably going to go one by one. It's. Obviously, I'm sure they told you guys like you are working with  us now, or whatever. <br/>Here's my thing, though. Once devin and Wardog, that's five. <br/>Aurora. <br/>Aurora? You really think she's keen on that? I mean, I know she's on the bottom. <br/>Number one, obviously, being left out. Because it would have been so easy to tell me before. So I don't feel like any of them trust me. <br/>I've heard no one say your name. I mean, I know our goal is we've got to get to this level, but  I'd like us to stay longer than that. <br/>Aurora feels on the outs. <br/>She is. Let's say we do have six. It would be a tie. <br/>Unless they think they have, like you and devins or  something, and then try and split. <br/>Yeah. Then--  And then we have the numbers. <br/>Okay. Actually, I like that plan. I'm really excited about what Wentworth is proposing because the  Kama tribe are in control of this game. I'm not in control of anything. I'm-- I'm just a piece in their game. Especially the people who are in charge of tlike Ron and erik. <br/>I'm sort of leaning towards splitting the votes over Lauren  and Kelley. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay...  We need to band together and flip this game on its head. I've just got to pull in my stRongest alliance member, which is  devins. That should be no problem. I'll talk to Rick later, obviously right now now. <br/>I hope he understands there are no hard feelings about  anything. <br/>So, the five Lesu together. <br/>I'm dying to get back about the old Lesu. Now that I know I can trust you guys, I really want to get back  with you all. <br/>You--  Except they don't [bleep] want to get back with you guys  at all? <br/>What do you mean? <br/>Why would I work with you guys? <br/>Well, I mean--  You guys stabbed me in the back over and over again. I don't want to work with Kelley at all. She tried to vote me out twice. <br/>You come here for ninth or eighth, that's fine. I came to win the game. <br/>Why would I want to work with them? <br/>Because it gets you farther in the game. <br/>I don't know that that's true. I don't know that that's true. I know it gets you furgts in the game and shiks things up. It was so stupid, don't come out here and Wardog me and yell at  me that I'm not playing the game you think I should be playing. I'm going home. Did you come to me? Did you come to me? I don't like being barkd at. <br/>You're playing with emotions. <br/>You keep saying I'm playing with emotions. <br/> You have playing with emotions. <br/>If I can't trust Lesu, let's get in with Kama. They just saved me at last tribal. Don't bark at me that I'm not playing the game because I'm not  doing what you want me to do. He needs David and I to swing with them but it's not going to  happen. <br/>You always remember one conversation in  "Survivor," you will remember this one. I'm a pupet and you're a puppet. We are not driving this game. Erik is driving it. And Ron is driving it. We need to navigate our own ships. <br/>But my way is better for me. You're not getting numbers, bro. I think you're dreaming. I think you're getting played. <br/>There's nothing more important than break up Kama. But, unfortunately, devins is not on board, 100% opposed to it. <br/>One of us is drunk right now, but I don't know which one. I think I'm the sober one. <br/>I'm not coming to your side. <br/>Remember we have the idol. <br/>I just thought you would give me the half back. <br/>If you don't mind, I'd like to hang on to it. Devin is letting emotions run to his game, so the last thing I  want to do is give him the half of the idol. It's so frustrating to have found someone I trust as much as I  trust devins and realize I have to find another path. I wanted it to be with devin but the way it's shaping up right  now I'm not sure there's any hope of that. These wine bottles. <br/>All at the same time? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Honestly, I'm terrible with riddles. I'm even worse with maps. I was ready to take a nap. It's been rocky thus far but your game is still at stake. Step back and assess, an advantage awaits. <br/>"Step back and assess, an advantage  awaits."  Did you hear about what happened last time? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>I already have my shoes on because I know what happens  when there's new on extinction-- you best be running because it's like black  friday and you better get the toy. <br/>If because someone here's going to get it. <br/>I'm coming for you, Aubry. I'm coming for you. <br/>Chris, are you not going to get me this time, pal. <br/>It's been rocky thus far, but your game is still at stake. Is there a stake somewhere near the rocks? <br/>Did you find it? Step back and assess. <br/>I've been here for three freaking weeks. I would just like to find something. <br/>"Step back." I'm not sure exactly what it means. There are some stairs. There are some steps. And I feel like it's right under everyone's nose, but I can't  seem to find it. <br/>Everyone starts checking the steps. They see absolutely nothing. I took a step back, look to my left, there's a big hole in the  rock wall. But I'm like, "This is mine! "So sneaky, sneaky, like Kelley Wentworth. Nothing here. I stick my hand in, and turns out, there is a key and a clue  that says, "Follow the rocks to the last in the sand, where your  practice begins." all right. What the hell, man. I go over the rocks, get to the sandy beach, and I see a post  with rope. It looks like I found the practice advantage. And I am stoked. I've been hanging with these bros, listen to them talk about how  they're going to get back in the game and win. But little do they know that the practice advantage even exists. And I found something else tucked up in the rocks-- this. An extra vote for someone in the game. Okay. Wow. That's big. This is amazing! Now, not only do I get to practice to get back in the game, but  I also have a decision to make. I have to decide who I want to give this extra vote to. Loosen that. Gotta tighten here. So I might be out of sight, out of mind at the Edge of  Extinction, but I know that the game is always there. And the advantage could be literally the key to someone's game. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! All right, shall we get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: First things first, Julie. Got to take back the necklace. Oh, the frown. You can win it again. <br/>That's true. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to balance on your toes with  a block wedged between your head and the top of the frame. The longer the challenge goes, the more fatigued your legs will  become. When they finally give out, your block will drop. You're out. Last person left standing wins immunity, safe from the vote. Losers, tribal council, where somebody will become the eighth  person voted out of this game. Take your spots. We'll get started. All right, here we go. Everybody place your blocks above your head. You're going to wedge them between your head and the top of the  frame, which is going to force you to stand on your toes. That's where this challenge is difficult. Everybody looks good, and this challenge is on. And quickly, you will feel it. Somebody may drop very fast. If you lose your balance and touch the frame, even a little,  you're out. Wardog quickly struggling to balance. That block falls. Within 15 seconds, Wardog is the first out. No shot at immunity. Take a spot on the bench. Wentworth already feeling it. <br/>I'm, like, shaking. <br/>Jeff: 22 days on "Survivor" is impossible to  imagine. You only know what it feels like when you are the one who has  experienced it. That's why you're shaking seconds into this challenge. Wentworth really fighting to keep that balance. Keep digging! Erik is out. He'll talk a spot on the bench. Gavin drops out of nowhere purpose we're down to nine. And Wentworth drops. She's out. We've already lost four of the fittest people in this game. Devens a sudden five of the fittest now. Devens joinsz the ranks of the fittest Survivors in this  challenge. We are down to seven. Julia wobbling. Julia, block drops. She's out. Down to six. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: Ron drops. Ron is out. And we are down to five. <br/>Aah! <br/>Jeff: Julie's out of the challenge. We're down to four: David, Victoria, Aurora, and Lauren. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: David, a nice recovery. Holding that block steady. You're still looking good up top. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: viktorria, very calm right next to David, hasn't  moved, hasn't opened her eyes. Aurora still very solid. Lauren very solid. Are we could be here for a while. Are we could be here for a while. <br/>Jeff: 25 minute in, David, viktorria, Aurora, and Lauren  still fighting for that necklace. David's feet moving once again. <br/>I'm a little dizzy. <br/>Jeff: First bit of movement from Lauren, just a slight  adjustment, trying to keep from going numb, probably. <br/>Very dizzy. <br/>Jeff: Aurora with a bit of movement. Victoria still absolutely solid. <br/>Damn the skinny girls. <br/>Aah! <br/>Jeff: David drops. [ applause ]  Thanks, guys. <br/>Jeff: That's how easily it can happen. A slight change in the pressure from your head to that block to  the top of the frame. And you're out. <br/>I can't see anything. I'm about to black out. <br/>Oh, my God! Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: Medical, medical! <br/>What happened? <br/>Lauren passed out. Just keep going. <br/>Oh, my good. <br/>She's got people around her, vick. <br/>She's okay. <br/>Lauren? <br/>Jeff: Joe, let me know if we need to stop this challenge. Don't worry, she's in good hands. For now we'll let it run. Go dr Joe will let us know. <br/>Lauren, you can hear me? <br/>Victoria it's you and I. Victoria. <br/>I'm okay, Aurora. <br/>I know. You know that I was the only person out of that vote. <br/>What did you say? <br/>I need this, just to feel better about our group. <br/>Pass me the orange case over there, please. Lauren, Lauren. <br/>Jeff: Even now, while lawr sen on the ground, Aurora is  pleading with Victoria to give this to her. <br/>I was the only one left out of the vote, dude. <br/>Aurora, just wait. Aurora, it's not the time. <br/>Yeah, it really isn't. <br/>No, dude, second-half challenges are all about skinny,  lean people. <br/>It's okay. <br/>Check her pulse. Give her a moment. <br/>Hey, Lauren. You just fainted. <br/>Damn it! <br/>How you feeling? Just give yourself a minute, Lauren. You feel a bit lightheaded. <br/>Jeff: Dr. Joe, you're okay over there? Okay. Lawr sen good. She's back. <br/>You just relax. <br/>No one was left out but me, Victoria. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I'm gonna [bleep] losa. <br/>You want me to trust you, I need this. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, I'm just checking. You're good, right? <br/>Yeah, I'm just embarrassed. <br/>Jeff: You just-- you literally just dropped pup fell off  the challenge. <br/>Well, that's embarrassing. <br/>Jeff: No, I'd say that's a sign of a warrior. I can tell everybody you're okay? <br/>Yeah, I'm great. <br/>Jeff: Lawr sen okay. Just get back in this. <br/>I mean, even-- you hear erik saying, "Go, vic."  no one said, "Go, Aurora" again, vic, you want me to trust. <br/>Good luck, Aurora. <br/>I don't know if that one counts. <br/>Jeff: And out of nowhere, Victoria drops. Aurora did not have to negotiate for individual immunity. Aurora wins immunity. Safe tonight at tribal council. Both women now trying to get some feeling back in their legs. [ applause ] take your time. <br/>Have a seat. <br/>Yeah, yeah. I'm okay. <br/>Jeff: Aurora, come on over. [ applause ] Aurora, safe tonight at tribal council. Cannot be vote out of this game. As for the rest of you, after 22 very tough days, somebody will  become the eighth person voted our the "Survivor: Edge of Extinction."  it won't be you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Congrats. <br/>Great job. <br/>It was really scary when I passed out, but I was even more  pissed that I was on the ground because that means I didn't win, and it  leaves me very, very vulnerable but playing my idol is the absolute last  resort. <br/>You girls were incredible. Congratulations. That was awesome. <br/>There's not a better feeling than going into a tribal,  knowing that you're 100% safe, especially when everything around you has told  you lately you are not safe. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>So I get back to camp, and I'm happy. But then I go in my bag, and there is a parchment. And I'm pretty sure I don't have a parchment. So I immediately sneak away. Hmmm, what is this? "When it is time to vote, use this parchment to cast a  second vote." holy crap. I love you, Joe, or Aubry, or whoever. I went from feeling like not accepted, to then having the power  of an extra vote to cast at any time. It's amazing. But right now, I'm going to stick with the numbers, and hold my  tongue until it's time to make a move. <br/>We made it, Kama. Kama stRong, one, two, three. Kama stRong! If we stay together, all of our loved ones come. What an amazing journey we started together. Loved one togethers. <br/>Erik and I are working together to control everybody. And we're using the loved one visit as a threat almost by  saying, "Don't we all want to have our loved ones here?" by saying  that it makes them not flip and try to have another alliance. It's genius. <br/>The only reason to not split is if we don't trust seven  people standing here right now. And that's why I think we should split. <br/>I think you go-- you have to go after Kelley first. If you're going to go after the girls, you have to go after Kelley. <br/>I find the girls a threat overall, but Lauren is much more  physical. <br/>She's competing very well. <br/>I know this Kama alliance won't last forever. Things are going to get crazy, and when it does, myself and Ron  have David and Devens in our pocket to make the big move. But it's not a worry for today. Let's use our nabs we so craftily acquired, and let's split some  votes, and let's get some of those Lesu players out, starting with Kelley. <br/>I feel like I'm going to cry. <br/>No, I know. It's like they're so happy to just pick us all off, and then  have--  They're not looking at, like, the bigger picture. <br/>They're not. They just want to have a civil war after we're all gone. That's what they want. <br/>Well, see you on extinction. <br/>That's about probably the size of it. <br/>The original Kama people, along with Rick Devens, are all  this big voting bloc, like they're going to vote probably for myself or Lauren  tonight. And it's a scary thing. Luckily, Lauren and I have idols. <br/>Yeah, exactly. <br/>When you have an idol, it's just about, like a gut  feeling, and hoping that you are right. <br/>I know this is going to play out. It could be me going oracley going home, or Lauren, but the seven  of you Kama, the final seven ain't going to be seven. We have to go out there and try to find cracks. You can't say, "Ooms, I tried. It didn't work." you keep fighting in this game. Like I want to have open communication with you. <br/>Right. <br/>Sound fair, right. I love to leave the lines of communication open. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And I'm feeling like somebody is going to get eag or the  seven, and you, David, and Devens are the soldiers in their army. My best strategy is to convince those younger Kama people that they  need soldiers for a war. Because once that war starts, who is David and Devens siding on? You have to ask yourself: David and Devens, if that war goes  down, and theatre two left, are they siding with you or siding with Ron or  erik. And they got those two guys off, they win the game. When it's time, if you need a soldier, you have Wardog here. <br/>Got you. <br/>You know what I'm saying? <br/>Dial him up. <br/>Wardog was breaking down his perception of the dynamics of  Kama. Saying that Ron and erik are trying to pull in David and Devens,  and strcially make a move on Gavin, Victoria, and myself. And Wardog might have a point. And I didn't realize it until he said it. <br/>What's going on, erik? <br/>Not much. <br/>I'm going to have to test erik by trying to push a David  or Devens vote, and that will be the true testament who 2 who's working with  who. Let me run something past you. Do you think it would be wise to maybe take out David before a Lauren  or a Kelley? <br/>You mean, like, right now? <br/>Yes. <br/>Um, I think-- I think we can make it till eight. In the past he went to rocks. In his old season. So I think he has a good track record of loyalty. <br/>Wardog was right-- they are going to try to use David and Devens  down the road to flip on us Kama members. <br/>Just no one do anything stupid. We're going to vote for family visit. <br/>It might be my time to make a big move. <br/>I feel like erik, Ron, and jail, and me, you and vic. I feel like they're trying to bring in David and Devens. <br/>It's me, you, and vic vote with Wardog--  Hold on. <br/>And Kelley, we can take out whoever we want. <br/>What if, like, we do this vote, and take out erik, and  then--  Why not Ron? [ whistles ]. <br/>Eare, ic and Ron saying, "We've got to get to the  family visit." it was like an epiphany. I have to win for my family, and that's why I'm stepping my game  up and coming in with guns blation. We're not going to win this game if we don't make big moves like  this. I'm telling you, it's the best move for us. <br/>I'm in. <br/>So here's my theory: What if they're keeping David and Devens  to flip on Kama. <br/>If that's how you feel, then we just make sure we get out David  second. <br/>Vic's not down with the shenanigans. <br/>You're not. <br/>She said it's too soon. <br/>I just think you go one vote before you do any of this. I do. <br/>Every decision, every option carries some risk in this  game. Tonight, we can stay Kama stRong, and it can be an easy vote  taking out Kelley. Or we can pull in the people at the bottom, and we can make a  big move now. And target Ron or Eric. They've taken advantage of the power that this alliance has  gotten. But the bad part for them is that we realize it. And they might be at the wRong side of the vote come tribal  council. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. <br/>Jeff: Eric, one of the big topics at the last tribal was  the dominance of Kama. One of the things that comes with that is you have to navigate  the relationships that can win or lose a game. <br/>Well, tonight, the Kama seven had a beach-fRont  roundtable, and we came up with a group decision. <br/>Jeff: But that still leaves five people not in. How do you navigate those relationships? <br/>Well, I think these Lesu members, they come in packages. And so, you navigate them carefully, of course. <br/>I like that terminology, "Packages," because this  package I'm part of wasn't given any kind of marching orders, so maybe the  other package is more in with the Kama seven than I am. <br/>Jeff: Devens, were you aware of the Kama seven having  their beach-side chat? <br/>Yes, they didn't try to keep it a secret, and they know  exactly where I stand. I was out of Lesu's five as soon as I was voted out of Lesu's  five. So the trust factor from Lesu is pretty messed up. <br/>Okay, okay, Devens, okay, whatever you say. <br/>I mean, straight up. <br/>I have no reason to lie. I'm already against you guys, so I'm doing everything I can to  get on the Kama train. <br/>Jeff: David, do you know what Devens is talk about. <br/>Devyns and I were spared last vote. They saved us. We are stay taij in the game where everyone up here has to  decide soon whether or not they want to be a pilot or a passenger. And a pilot wins at the end. With the numbers being what they are, I am a passenger tonight. <br/>Jeff: Eric, what does that say to you? <br/>It's a message, right, it's a message to the Kama seven  that says, "Some of you may want to consider your position in the  tribe."  But, honestly, you have to avoid paranoia, and you have to  stay stRong, and the longer you can keep that alliance together where people  trust each other, the stRonger you're going to be, and the longer you last. <br/>And I will say maybe it doesn't feel great to feel like a  passenger, but I know from talking to everyone up here how much we all want  to see our loved ones. So why don't we stay focused here, get a couple of votes down  the road--  Are we playing for a million dollars or just playing to  get to the loved ones visits. By then, the other Lesu packages will be gone, and maybe you  can't make a move then. <br/>It's crazy for me to be saying I'm agreeing with Wardog on  a particular point here. Getting to the loved ones visit say benchmark and it's important  to everybody and you crave it. But if you aren't careful you'll find yourself on day 39 way  blank resume. There are lots of blank sheets of paper sitting up here right  now with maybe only their names and addresses. And a lot of those addresses read, "44, 44, Edge of  Extinction drive."  Jeff: Julia, is it to be amounted that at some point, yes,  we are going to make a move. We have to. There are only so many spots at the final. <br/>I think it's on everyone's mind. And whether or not there of they're willing to make a move right  now is where they're wavering. <br/>Jeff: Victoria, are you in line with that? Is everybody thinking that on some level? It's just a matter of when do I make my move? <br/>Just because you're thinking about it doesn't mean now  with 12 people still in the game is when you make your move. Shoot your shot as long as you're not shooting yourself in the  foot. I want to keep my feet tonight. <br/>Jeff: Ron, what do you say tonight to make sure people  don't make the move? <br/>For me, personally, I wouldn't want to go with all of the Lesu  members right now, because I know they're put me on the bottom. <br/>Jeff: And, yet, are you fully open for business if people  want to join your alliance. <br/>Yes. We have limited spaces only for a limited time only. <br/>There's no space for me, Lauren, and Wentworth. That's pretty clear. <br/>Jeff: Aurora, what's your mood right now? Because you're wearing the immunity necklace, but until just that  moment, you had had not the least bit of a smile. It was a scowl. <br/>I mean, there's a lot of talk about how stRong Kama is and  how we really have taken control of this game. But if you look, it's not that we've taken control of the game. It's that everyone who's not in this Kama stRong has literally  fall tone pieces. Everyone has the chance to take control of this game. It's just who's going to actually decide to do it. <br/>Jeff: All right, it is time to vote. Wentworth, you're up. <br/>Kelley, sometimes you're just on the wRong side of the  numbers. Tonight, that's you. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Jeff: If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want  to play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. <br/>Jeff: First vote, Wentworth. Lauren. Lauren. That's two votes Lauren. Wentworth. That's two votes Wentworth. Eric. Eric. We're tied, two votes Lauren, two votes Wentworth, two votes Eric. Eric. That's three votes Eric, two votes Lauren, two votes Wentworth. Eric. That's four votes Eric. Eric. That's five votes Eric. Eighth person voted out and the fifth member of our jury, Eric. That's six. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Bravo! Man! You guys are good! Eric, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>What a fun experience. Hope see you soon. <br/>By Eric. . [ sighs ]  Come on!

I've never seen anything like it. <br/>Yeah, they got me pretty good. Somebody mounted something, so here I am on the Edge of  Extinction. All I know is that it's hard. I don't know how many days I have to be here, but I have a sense  this is going to be the crucible of internal struggle. Hey, this is better than I thought it would be. <br/>Dude, don't get excited.
