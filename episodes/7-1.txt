<br/>Jeff: We’re on board the Rembrandt van Rijn heading south off  the coast of Panama to a remote location in the Pacific waters of Central  America. Down below, sixteen Americans who have no idea the adventure of a  lifetime has already begun. After traveling all night, they arrived Panama  City early this morning, boarded this vessel, suitcases still in tow, still  wearing the same clothes they had on on the plane. Right now, they’re  relaxing, under the false assumption that we are several days away from  starting the game. They think we’re heading out to take publicity photos.  What they don’t know, this game has already started. And it is full of  surprises. For instance, those suitcases, so carefully packed with essential  outdoor clothing, worthless. The only clothes they’re gonna be taking are the  clothes on their back. And more twists await. Their destination, the Pearl  Islands, a land with a bloody history of looting and piracy. Brutal battles  took place in these waters as pirates preyed on unsuspecting ships, plundering  their gold, silver, and pearls. The jungles, which were the perfect hideout  for these pirates, are rugged. The weather, temperamental. The waters here  are home to some of the most magnificent but deadly marine life anywhere in  the Pacific Ocean. Sharks, stingrays, eels, even whales thrive in a  spectacular world beneath the sea. This will be their home for the next 39  days. They must learn to adapt, or they’ll be voted out of the tribe. In the  end, only one will remain to claim the million dollar prize. Thirty-nine  days, eighteen people, one survivor. <br/>(theme song playing) <br/>Jeff: Welcome guys, to Survivor: Pearl Islands. The game is on.  We’re starting right now. I know everybody here brought their suitcases. I  know you got a lot more luggage downstairs. And it’s true in the past,  Survivors have been allowed to go through their luggage and pick out a few  essential items. You guys won’t have that luxury.  <br/>(nervous giggling) <br/>Jeff: You’re going into this game with the clothes you have on  your back, just like if you really were shipwrecked. <br/>Sandra: He says the game stars, you’re taking nothing. I was  like, “Oh …” <br/>Jeff: Looking at the wardrobe, I got to say, a couple of nice  suits up here. <br/>(laughing) <br/>Shawn: I’m wearing an Armani suit. How am I going to get by?  What am I gonna do with a suit? <br/>Jeff: A very cute strapless dress, I hope you’re wearing  something under that. <br/>Nicole: I was like, okay, you know, I don’t have a bra on, I  hope my dress stays up. <br/>Jeff: I’m sure the Boy Scouts of America will be glad to see  they’re represented. <br/>Jeff: When it comes to your footwear, however, I took the  liberty of going through your suitcases. Here are your tennis shoes. I want  you to have a fighting chance at the challenges. Okay. Now, I need to get  your personal items. I want everything. Start getting it out-- watches,  wallets, money, passports, and any jewelry you don’t want to lose, I want in  here. Bags are staying behind, so you don’t need to go through  your  bags, just anything else.  <br/>(laughter) Jeff: You were really hoping, weren’t you? <br/>Osten: I was hoping. Hey there’s a snowball’s chance in hell  that I thought you guys would let me bring this. <br/>Jeff: Put it in there. Okay, your tribe names-- going to be  based on two of the most notorious pirates in Panamanian history-- the Drake  Tribe, after Sir Francis Drake, and the Morgan Tribe, after Henry Morgan. So,  as I call out your name, you’ll come forward, we’ll divide the tribes. First  up: Shawn, wearing blue. (Advertising Sales) First member of the Drake tribe,  have a spot over here. Darrah, wearing orange. (Mortician) First member of  the Morgan tribe, have a spot over here. Christa (Computer Programmer) next  member of the Drake tribe. Come on up, Christa. Osten (Equity Trade Manager),  come on up. Look at that loot. That is pirate-like. You got booze,  music.  <br/>Osten: That’s booty. <br/>Jeff: Rupert (Troubled Teens Mentor), next member of the Drake  Tribe. Have a spot. Welcome.  <br/>Christ: Rupert is the man. I thought, this dude is cool, he’s a  big old hippie, and uh, he looks strong as an ox. <br/>Jeff: Next member of the Morgan Tribe, Boy Scout, Lill (Scout  Troop Leader). Welcome. <br/>Lill: Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Next member of the Drake Tribe: Trish (Sales Executive).  Thank you. Next member of the Morgan Tribe, Ryan (Produce Clerk). Welcome.  Next member of the Drake Tribe, Burton (Marketing Executive). Next member of  the Morgan Tribe, Tijuana (Pharmaceutical Sales). Look at those heels. <br/>Osten: Tijuana, she’s unbelievable. She’s like a Nubian  princess. That’s how good looking she is. <br/>Jeff: Next member of the Drake Tribe, Michelle (Student).  Welcome.  <br/>Michelle: Thanks. <br/>Jeff: Next member of Morgan, Ryan (Electrician). We have two  Ryans. Wearing blue for the Drake tribe, Jon (Art consultant). <br/>Jon: I go by the moniker of Jonny Fairplay. I don’t play fair. <br/>Jon: What’s up big boys?! Let me hear it! <br/>Jeff: The Morgan tribe is about to be very happy. Here’s the  woman who’s wearing nothing under her dress. Come on down, Nicole (Massage  Therapist).  <br/>Nicole: Found a new use for this thing.  <br/>Jeff: You’re right, works as a great tube top. Personal items,  please. And you’re over there. Give me those personal items. Last member of  the Drake Tribe, Sandra (Office Assistant). Last member of the Morgan Tribe,  Andrew (Attorney). Sporting a nice tie and expensive suit. <br/>Andrew: Thanks, man.  <br/>Jeff: Now, if you thought the clothing issue was tough, it’s  about to get worse, because when you arrive at your camp, there’s nothing  waiting for you there, either. Nothing-- no food whatsoever, not the first  bit of tools, no flint and steel to start fire. I mean zip. What I can offer  you, though, is this-- the opportunity to control your own fate. 100 Balboas  in here-- that’s Panamanian money. Behind me… small fishing village. You’re  in luck, it’s market day. I’m not going to lie to you. It’s a small village,  there’s not a lot there, but if you’re smart and you have a plan, you can get  everything you need-- the essentials to help you survive 39 days. Explore  this village. There’s a lot of nooks and crannies, knock on doors. When you  run out of money, barter with what you have, which is granted, not much, but  use it. You’re not coming back here. Map to your new home. You must set aside  enough money to hire a boat and a driver to get you to your camps. You each  will have your own island, and they are a long ways away. You need to be  there by sundown. Got a lot to accomplish in the next few hours. You’re going  to have to work together as a tribe to pull it off. I wish you the very best  of luck.  <br/>Ryan S: I was like Oh my god, what have I done? This is beyond  what I bargained for. I knew it was going to be the adventure of a lifetime.  I didn’t know it was going to be this big of an adventure of a lifetime. <br/>Jeff: Drake, there’s a life ring, Morgan, there’s a life ring.  If you needed a reason to get in, here it is. There go the shoes. Go, guys!  Life ring. Somebody better get your life ring, or you’re never gonna make it  in. Better not dilly-dally.  <br/>Osten: I don’t get in the water. I respect the water. (laughs)  Unless, I absolutely have to, and I had to. And I’m not like, that strong of  a swimmer, so I was in a state of shock. I was like, “Oh my Lord. I could be  in some… a world of hurt right now. <br/>Rupert: I never would have thought swimming with my clothes on  would have been so hard, but it was. With my big denim jeans, my legs were  rubber. It took all I had to keep kicking and getting it to shore. I was  spent, and it hadn’t even started yet.  <br/>Osten: The girls, they’re… they’re running off… so we have to  carry the… <br/>Ryan S: I’ll carry their crap. <br/>Ryan S: We didn’t come together at all. I was hoping that we  would come together with some plans and some goals, uh, what we wanted to go  to first, but that wasn’t the case at all. Uh, some of the girls took off. <br/>Nicole: Do you know where we can get a boat?  <br/>Ryan S: And uh, Ryno, he just took off. He was gone-- it’s like  he wasn’t even a part of the tribe. He was gone, and he had his own mission.  I don’t even remember him consulting anybody about it. <br/>Ryano O: Fire? Flint? <br/>No, no, no. <br/>Ryan O: No? Uh, boat?  <br/>Boat? Yes, yes. <br/>Ryan O: Okay. <br/>Ryan O: I wanted to check out the village and get to certain  places and find where stuff was first and also try to find where the boat  was. And I run all the way down to the boat dock, and I didn’t have a map. I  didn’t have any money to pay this guy.  <br/>Ryan O: What’s the most to go pretty much anywhere? I forgot my  map.  <br/>Nadie habla inglés.  <br/>Ryan O: Screwed up this one.  <br/>Shawn: Alright, someone sit on it for a minute.  <br/>Burton: Well here, here’s our group. <br/>Shawn: Alright. Let’s get the money. Where’s the money? We need  it. <br/>Rupert: When I got to those stairs, I was done. We sit the  sucker down, and I needed to rest. The other team, Morgan, came up, sat their  stuff down next us, and all left. This is definitely a pirate adventure.  Pirates pillage, pirates steal, pirates take advantage. If they were gonna be  silly enough to put it right next to me, I’m gonna put it in my thing. All  their trade goods, all the little women’s shoes, the insoles. Everything that  I could find in theirs, I took. I’ve always said I will lie, cheat, and steal  to win this game. We’re going on. There was my stealing. I stole for the  Drake. <br/>Rupert: Take them, take them. You know, get anything. <br/>Jon: Whose are these?  <br/>Rupert: Pirated. <br/>Jon: Oh.  <br/>Rupert: Feel that, feel that. For a knife? For a pineapple?  Shoes <br/>Cambiarlo por eso?  <br/>Rupert: Pineapple? Yeah? <br/>Rupert: We are pirates… so we pirated. Yeah, it’s a hard life,  living the pirate’s life. <br/>Tijuana: We got water. <br/>Osten: We got water? Okay, we need um...  <br/>Tijuana: Machete?  <br/>Osten: We got, we got, we got knives, we got knives.  <br/>Tijuana: We need flint and steel.  <br/>Osten: How ‘bout food? Fishing stuff. Where’s the fishing stuff? <br/>Osten: The way we attacked getting our supplies at the village  was, uh, a bit chaotic. It was confusion.  <br/>Tijuana: Rice? Rice?  <br/>Rice.  <br/>Ryan O: Hey, Ryan, how many candles? <br/>Osten: You want to buy a belt? By chance? Buy a belt. Stand up  real quick, come on. Stand up, come here.  <br/>Osten: We only had a limited amount of money, so I made an  impulsive decision to sell my clothes to benefit my tribe. Slide them right  in there. Look at that. That’s unbelievable. That looks… that looks great.  How, how… I sell it to you? <br/>Dos Balboas. <br/>Osten: Thank you partner. I appreciate it. <br/>Osten: You know, you got to fast-talk some people. And I was  willing to try to do whatever it took to- to make the sale so that we could  have more money for my group to do whatever we needed to do with the money. <br/>Osten: Let me, uh, let me talk… Can I talk to two girls real  quick? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Osten: Just a little strategy. Come here.  <br/>Lill: I’m listening too. <br/>Osten: Okay, come on. But you know old, old men are real horny.  So, maybe sometimes if we don’t have  money, flash your boobs-- give ‘em  a quick peek or something like that, all right? I don’t mean to be rude, but  that- that could help. <br/>Nicole: Osten goes “You know girls, we don’t necessarily have to  spend our money. These old guys, they’re really horny, so you can just show  them your boobs. He didn’t even know our names really yet, or- or us at all.  That was his first, you know, introduction to us. So I was just like, “This  guy’s a jerk.” <br/>(cheering) <br/>Sandra: (speaking Spanish) He wants three and three, but the guy  told us two up there. We buy the rice from him. <br/>Jon: Sandra, she was so amazing, in the town because she spoke  the language and worked out all these incredible deals. And we would… it  wouldn’t have been possible.  <br/>Trish : Hola! <br/>Sandra: When we got to the village, I was lucky that I knew  Spanish. And I was trying to bargain with the lady at the store and ask  people for certain things.   <br/>Burton: What’s the cheapest lantern? And do they…? <br/>Sandra: Por favor… <br/>I will make you a deal… I will give you the lamp and the  kerosene, but in return I want her to give me her eyes.  <br/>Trisha: Gracias. <br/>Sandra: Your eyes for hers.  <br/>Sandra: The lady at the store had it in for Trisha. Trisha  thought the lady was laughing and giggling with her or whatever. But the lady  actually, I think, you know liked her. In a sexual way. <br/>She stays with me, that’s a good trade. <br/>Sandra: There’s Trisha hugging the lady, laughing and giggling  like it’s all good, and I’m like “Yo, we need to go.”  <br/>Sandra: You got to stay with her. We’re gonna leave you here for  a few minutes. <br/>Christa: I feel that the village people really respected Sandra  because she was being nice and decent about things and respectful, unlike the  other tribe that was screaming at people. <br/>Tijuana: Give me my money back. Money. I need my money back. I  don’t want it. Money. Okay, if y’all gonna steal from me, I’m gonna steal  from y’all.  <br/>Osten: Yeah this is the one we paid for. We gave the money. <br/>No, no, no, no, no, no. <br/>Tijuana: Then don’t do this! Don’t do this!  <br/>No, no, no, no, no, no. <br/>Tijuana: Where’s our money?  <br/>Tijuana: We’re walking out with the merchandise we paid for and  then another person says, “No you didn’t pay for it”?! Wait, what? I- I’m  sorry? So it definitely was a difficult situation, especially when you don’t  know all of the words that you need to say. <br/>No! No, no, no. Where’s the money?  <br/>Osten: Hey, hey, she, she just told you she gave you the money. <br/>Tijuana: You’re stealing.  <br/>Nicole: I don’t really get along with Tijuana. She seemed like,  extremely over excited about certain things, and that was just frustrating  for me. <br/>Osten: Where’s the money? Okay, where’s the money? <br/>Tijuana: We handled it to the best of our ability. And in the  end, they came out on top by saying, “Basically, we’ll give this to you.” <br/>Okay, God will bless you. <br/>Tijuana: So it worked out well. <br/>(singing and clapping) <br/>Sandra: We went around the corner and there was this lady  having… they were dancing. She was having a barbecue, and I says, “You know,  I’ll give you this gold chain for everything you have here. And she looked at  my chain, and she was like “Yeah.” I put the chain around her neck, and she  was like, “What do you want?” I said, I want all your chicken, I want your  aluminum foil. I want your ketchup, your hot sauce, the barbecue sauce. She  had a cutting board, a knife. Everything. The only thing we didn’t take was  the grill. <br/>Jon: Yo, Blackbeard. <br/>Sandra; Oh, you won’t believe… <br/>Jon: She just traded her necklace. For her gold chain, we have… <br/>Sandra: I got knives. <br/>Rupert: Oh my God! <br/>Tijuana: I was definitely pissed to see the Drake Tribe and all  of the wealth that they’d come into, all of the fortune. That definitely just  kind of deflates you a little bit, like “Man, we could have done that. We  could have been even more prepared. They were taking their time, and we  weren’t.”  <br/>Osten: Okay, we got to get down there. Let’s get all our group--  it’s a long walk. Come on. You need help carrying or you good? <br/>Lill: I got it. <br/>Lill: Alright. Hey, Osten! We got tons of money! We got  money.  <br/>Ryan S: We had money left over.  <br/>Ryan S: Are we going to the boat now? Can we go get more fruit?  We have more money. <br/>Ryan S: We should have spent absolutely all of the money. I  don’t think we, uh, fundamentally did- did the right, right decision. I  think, I think we could’ve gotten a few more good supplies. I think people  were just too anxious to get on the boat and get- get the thing  started.  <br/>Osten: You said 35, so… Thank you. Okay, we’re loading right  now.  <br/>Osten: As far as getting enough of what we need, only time will  tell.  <br/>Let’s see, we have rice, we have beans, we have a container for  the rice. We got coconuts, we got another chicken.  <br/>Rupert: You know, I don’t know what more we need, really.  <br/>Sandra: We did very well in the village. You know we, we managed  to get a ton of stuff for the little bit of money we had. <br/>Shawn: We got fishing line, a bunch of hooks. I know we got a  fishing spear, uh, for catching fish. Um, we got wine, we got a- a huge tarp,  we got two machetes, which are essential. <br/>Sandra: We did good. We did good.  <br/>Trish: We got so much. I can’t believe how much we got.  <br/>Shawn: I put about $40 in my pocket so it wouldn’t be in the  bag, just as a safety measure. ‘Cause I figured with that, I can definitely  get a ride. <br/>Shawn: Let’s go guys. <br/>Christa: Get the chicken, get the chicken! <br/>Stop the chicken! Stop the chicken! <br/>(Rupert laughing) <br/>Christa: We’re pretty well fit for the jungle right now, we’re  definitely ready to go all-out for the next 40 days.  <br/>Ryan S: Seeing the flag, I’m thinking “I can’t believe I’m here,  this is the coolest thing that’s ever happened to me in my entire life.” I  think that should be the first big celebration, the sheer excitement. There  was none of that.  <br/>Lill: What do you guys think?  <br/>Osten: Want to get everybody here so we can say what we’re going  to do.  <br/>Ryan S: I got off the boat last. I got up, already people were  talking about, “Where do we want to put camp? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.”  I was like, man we’re here! Let’s jump up and down. Let’s give some hugs.  Let’s do something. There was none of that.   <br/>Osten: Someone get down there, we’ll scout out the area. Get the  fire going. And the heavier people can, uh, can move the stuff, move the  cargo.  <br/>Osten: I was in game mode. I wanted to get it done. The words  “Sunrise is going down quickly” came in my head. I knew that we needed to act  fast.  <br/>Osten: I’d say we have more room down there, but if you guys want  to all, as a group, go run down there? You want to go walk out real quick, so  we can just get the fire done like that?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Osten: Let’s go running. We don’t have a lot of time. Whoo! <br/>Ryan S: Osten was running up and down looking for the perfect  spot to put the camp. Osten’s a big dude. I mean he’s got like muscles out to  yay, and uh, I’ve been noticing them the whole time. Because he- he lets you  know he has muscles, lets you know, “Hey, I am strong.” I’m like, okay. <br/>Osten: We can cut a couple of these branches down. These will  kind of, like, protect us from the, from the rain a little bit. You want to  start the fire, and I’ll start bringing stuff over here? <br/>Lill: Okay. <br/>Osten: Lillian in her scout uniform was interesting to say the  least. I was completely thrown off-kilter when I saw that. I didn’t know what  the hell was going on or was it a joke, or what was going on. I was just  confused. <br/>Nicole: Here, I’ll blow on it. <br/>Lill: My troop back home would kick my butt knowing I’m using a  candle. It’s real hard to take off this scout hat. It’s real hard not to be  the scoutmaster here.  <br/>Lill: Oh baby. <br/>Nicole: Good job. <br/>Lill: Oh baby. Team effort here, girl. <br/>Nicole: Yeah. <br/>Ryan O: If we build the shelter like this, into the rock, lean  it up against the rock. You want to do that? A lot less work. <br/>Andrew: There’s this big shale rock wall, and we think, there’s  this great bamboo post just naturally lying around, and we’re like, this is  the best.  <br/>(Osten grunting) <br/>Tijuana: Oh my goodness! <br/>Ryan S: We made sure we had somewhat of a shelter. It was a… a  lean-to. (laughs). But… oh, well. You can only do so much in that amount of  time. <br/>(cheering) Whoo-hoo! <br/>Michelle: Whoo! <br/>All right, guys. <br/>Some rice, baby. <br/>Don’t waste the food. <br/>It’s home sweet home.  <br/>Rupert: I think that’s it.  <br/>Shawn: Are you all right, guys?  <br/>Come on in, we’re all here.  <br/>We’re going to have the time of our life, and at the same time  we’re going to kick some butt! <br/>Great, great, great. <br/>Shawn: First things first, let’s get a shelter built.  <br/>Should we build a shelter like here? <br/>Shawn: If we build a shelter, like, here, we can go around the  tree.  <br/>This would be cool. <br/>Yeah this would be right here. <br/>Shawn: We’re going to build something this way. <br/>Burton: A shelter. Yeah, like a little shelter. The shelter  could go from here to here easily.  <br/>Shawn: Burton, as well as, um, myself, you know, off the start,  we started getting everything going. We were just a little more strong  personalities, a little more physical, you know, mentally, as well. <br/>Trish: So what’s the priority? Bamboo or firewood do you think? <br/>Shawn: Both.  <br/>Trish: I was surprised at how quickly we all worked together. I  mean, we didn’t know who we were, what your name was yet. And, um, within a  matter of probably ten minutes, we all sort of spread out, and it worked out  pretty well.  <br/>Burton: One of the first items on our to-do list when we got  here was to build a shelter. And we did that. Actually, it looked pretty  good.  <br/>Yay! <br/>Burton: You know what we need? A little bit bigger firewood. <br/>Christa: Bigger firewood?  <br/>Burton: We will pretty soon.  <br/>Christa: I was really tired, I mean, just exhausted. It was  like, for the love of God, I just wanted to breathe for a second, I was like,  does anybody have water? Here we go.  <br/>Sandra: Burton opened up a coconut, and he shared the coconut  milk with only Shawn and Michelle. I gave Christa the look and I said “Did  they offer you any coconut milk?” and she was like “No, and I wanted some.”  <br/>Shawn: Ah, refreshing. <br/>Shawn (to Sandra): Over on the other side, actually. Yeah. <br/>Shawn and Burton are a little out there in their leadership. <br/>Shawn: It’s a waste to just have it lying underneath like that.  It’s not doing anything. <br/>Put it the other way. <br/>I have a better idea.  <br/>Trish: I just think they need to be a little careful of that,  because they’ve already alienated some people.  <br/>Shawn: I love when people with a beard, it’s like, it catches  anything that falls. <br/>Burton: (laughing) <br/>Rupert: Shawn is being a pain in the butt. We’re a strong little  team, but the dynamic duo there that are posturing for the lead role need to  be a little more careful, because they’re going to make everybody hate  them.  <br/>Jon: There’s the other tree. <br/>Jon: After making the shelter, we went to go get water. <br/>Jon: Water well, big tree. <br/>The map says, “Go up a trail, and to the right.”  <br/>There it is. We got water.  <br/>Jon: It’s about a quarter of a mile to our water. It’s not that  bad. However, that’s where every single mosquito on this planet lives. Every  one of them.  <br/>Burton: Holy mosquito city. <br/>Christa: They are having parties all over me.  <br/>Jon: We didn’t get any, uh, bug oil? <br/>Shawn: Oh my God. I’m getting attacked. <br/>Michelle: I’m getting eaten alive. Every single one of us. It’s  worse than I have ever, ever, ever seen.  <br/>Shawn: We got to get out of here. <br/>Burton: God these bastards are everywhere.  <br/>Michelle: Oh, you’re just… <br/>Burton: Mine’s like, the craziest. Oh my God, you’re not too  great yourself. <br/>Jon: We were getting torn up pretty bad. I’m the least out of  anyone. That’s it. That’s all I got. Shawn? He looks like the moon, except in  reverse.  <br/>Tijuana: There’s not much water. <br/>Osten: We’re out of water? <br/>Tijuana: We’ve gone through it, a lot. We only brought, like,  18.  <br/>How much of that do we have left?  <br/>I don’t think we should drink anymore, unless we find some and  boil some.  <br/>Yeah, I think we…  <br/>We need to go find some.  <br/>Osten: I think water’s going to be real important.  <br/>Lill: Okay. <br/>So what is your sense of water supply? What- what are your  instincts on this? <br/>Lill: I don’t know. I mean I, I was looking for something that,  you know, followed us up into something, like animals would. <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Lill: We saw some running water, and uh, looked pretty orange,  it looked rusty. It was not the kind of water you’d want to drink, even if  you boiled it 42 hours. <br/>Stagnant water like that has a bunch of diseases in it. <br/>Ryan S: Looks like beer.  <br/>Osten: We meandered throughout this beach trying to guesstimate  where the water may or may not be, which was just a crucial mistake. Water’s  essential. You need that. The heat, the humidity, your body’s evaporating  fluids constantly. They need to be replenished, or you’ll dehydrate and  you’ll be going home. And I don’t want to go home right now. <br/>Uh-oh. What was that? <br/>Rocks and something falling. <br/>No. <br/>Huh? <br/>No. <br/>Yeah it was. From up… right up here.  <br/>Nicole: The rocks falling from the cliff, um, that just didn’t  work out at all. Because we think it’s going to get worse, especially if it  starts to rain. <br/>Ow! Something bit my ass!  <br/>(laughing) Are you serious?  <br/>I am! (laughing) <br/>What the hell is it? It felt like a crab. Where is it? I have a  feeling it was a crab. Oh now, how am I going to sleep? <br/>As far as the little hermit crabs, we think that we’re living in  their home, pretty much, because they were just crawling all over us, and  they pinch. And there were, I mean, literally dozens of them crawling through  there. Why don’t we just build a shelter that’s in the middle of a ring of  fire? And then no crabs can get to us.  <br/>My mistake was not lifting the shelter off the ground.  <br/>I’m sorry.  <br/>Whoa, whoa. <br/>We got a snake! <br/>Are you kidding?!  <br/>That’s not a snake, it’s a frond! <br/>Ryan O: Osten thought there was a snake, but it was a palm frond  that kept curling and moving. And he freakin’... he’s pushing people out of  there and we’re laughing. <br/>Osten: Holy mackerel. Oh my God, I could’ve sworn it was, like,  slithering. It kept coming down.  <br/>Osten: If I see something or feel something, I automatically go  right into freak-out mode and I don’t know why. Every time. It just never  fails. <br/>Osten: I, honest to God, thought I saw a snake. I’m not, I’m not  even lying. <br/>Andrew: It’s hilarious, we call him “Scary Mary,” because he’s  never really been in a jungle environment. Any little thing, and if it  touches his toe, he leaps out of the air, and just shrieks. <br/>How close was that? Was that a rock? <br/>That was a rock. That was a rock.  <br/>Alright. Let’s do a toast. To new friends, good friends, and  nobody going home anytime soon.  <br/>Whoo! Yay! <br/>Jon: I was big on getting the booze yesterday. We ended up  trading a pair of mismatched shoes for some jugs of wine. And that was a big  deal to me. <br/>Oh, good golly.  <br/>Rupert: We didn’t get any light, we didn’t get any soap. <br/>But we need booze. <br/>Rupert: We got booze. <br/>We got booze and shelter. What else do you need? <br/>Burton: I don’t know if it’s moonshine, wine, or just grain  alcohol, but we crack it open and taste it, it’s the best-tasting stuff we’ve  ever had. <br/>Jon: That’s good stuff, huh?  <br/>Oh God, yes. <br/>That is really good. <br/>Jon: Man, if you guys were 17, you’d be so naked. <br/>Like at the 7-11. <br/>The wah-wah. <br/>Rupert: Jon, he reminds me of my boys, who I mentor who just pop  off stupid stuff. You know, talk about getting some honey, or… smoking  something, drinking something.  <br/>Jon: Where are the teenage girls? <br/>Jon: Everyone laughs at all my jokes. I knew going in that was  going to be a huge bonus for me. Because I’m not very strong, and I… I don’t  profess to be. However, I’m a funny guy. <br/>Trish, the dish! You piss her off, she be a bitch. <br/>(Burton laughing) <br/>Christa: Jon is a goofball. You can kind of get the whole group  laughing and get it together. I mean, which is great because we definitely  need that out here. But I think at times he’s a little obnoxious.  <br/>Michelle: Anybody want this?  <br/>Jon: Yeah. I’m going crazy! He’s out of control. ( bleep ) you,  man, ( bleep ) you! <br/>Sandra: I really can’t stand him. He talks too much crap-- all  night long, cursing. He thinks it’s cute, but it isn’t. It gets old. It’s  already old. <br/>Jon: Whoo! A girl in Vegas ( bleep ). (laughter) <br/>Burton: Pass the bottle before you drop it. <br/>Jon: It’s so sick, it was ( bleep ). (laughter) <br/>I don’t think this is ever going to dry.  <br/>Michelle: Sleeping last night soaking wet really sucked.  <br/>Home would be so nice. <br/>Michelle: We did not purchase any clothes in the village. We  didn’t think it was necessary at the time. <br/>Trish (to Sandra): Hey girlie.  <br/>Sandra: Out of all the things that could happen, I never thought  that this would be one of them, to just have whatever you had on, and that  was it. <br/>Rupert: Man, I got to cut these damn pants off.  <br/>Rupert: I’m wearing my fancy, my dress jeans. Suckers were thick  and hard and heavy. Them pants killed my crotch, where nice wet denim rubs  for a day and a half and just starts eating that skin away. <br/>Sandra: I do not want to wear my sneakers today. I want them to  just dry for once, just once. <br/>Christa: A lot of us were pretty miserable, but it was like,  “Wait a second.” There’s really a lot of stuff that you can do with just a  few pieces of clothing. <br/>Michelle: I can cut that seem right there and make it a top and  tie it. <br/>Christa: That could be a really good top for you, actually. <br/>Trish: I can’t tell you how much better this feels. This wet  thing has been draping on me for days now. <br/>Sandra: I can walk in these.  <br/>Shawn: Finally making some shorts.  <br/>Michelle: Want me to cut it? <br/>Shawn: I’m wearing a nice Armani suit, but I had no choice--  they just had to come off. <br/>Yeah, baby. Beautiful. (laughing) <br/>As shorts, they dry in half the time, but I saved the bottoms,  ‘cause I’m planning on making them into convertible pants for the night. <br/>Christa: We can get two skirts out of this, and the bottom part  will be big enough for you.  <br/>Rupert: Okay. Definitely. <br/>Christa: My dress is falling apart, so we decided to go ahead  and improvise. <br/>All right, chop her up. <br/>Michelle: We had a little fashion club meeting and took apart  her dress. <br/>That is… <br/>Rupert: Oh, that is a skirt. You hold this. I want to put this  on me now.  <br/>Jon: Half of her dress is now a skirt for Michelle, and the  other half is a skirt for Blackbeard. <br/>What do you think?  <br/>My God, my thighs feel so much better.  <br/>I got the little teasing and laughing with the girls as we made  it and I put it on and I looked really silly. It’s done. I’m wearing a dress. <br/>I’m never gonna put them pants back on. <br/>Hey, you guys want to go get some water? <br/>Yeah… <br/>Aren’t we gonna look and check our mail?  <br/>I thought we were gonna all look for water first.  <br/>Lill: The biggest thing that we need is water. They say we’ll go  later for the water. Personally, we need to do it now. <br/>Water well… Oh shut up.  <br/>Water well! There’s a water well sitting right on the map. <br/>Tijuana: We were looking everywhere for the water source, not  looking “Oh let’s look at the map.” <br/>Tijuana: Water well is on our map.  <br/>Ryan S: Oh! <br/>Lill: Oh! <br/>Ryan S: Nicely done. <br/>Tijuana: Looked at the map, found “Water well,” was exciting  because we’d been needing water for so long. <br/>This is our boat. <br/>It’s a trail. <br/>So, it’s back here.  <br/>So we should just follow that trail on back there. <br/>Yeah, let’s go get water. <br/>Ryan S: Why didn’t we check the map earlier? That’s what makes  me angry. <br/>Lill: Well, we were so busy with everything. <br/>I know. We need to kick ass on that shelter. Here’s one of these  bad boys.  <br/>Andrew: Actually yesterday, we built a half A-frame up against a  shale wall. It’s actually pretty funny because I think the shale wall was the  home to about 300 hermit crabs, which paid us a visit in the middle of the  night. So, I thought we should probably move our shelter, so we’re doing a  little penthouse suite here. It’s actually going to have a floor. We don’t  want to be on the floor anymore, so… where the crabs can get us.  <br/>Lill: One of the biggest things in my troop is we tuck our  shirts in. We look like a Scout, we act like a Scout.  <br/>Ryan S: Yeah. <br/>Lill: And here I’m running around with my blouse open.  <br/>Ryan S: You know… <br/>Lill: My shirt tied at the waist. (laughing) I’m gonna come home  and they are going to razz me. <br/>Ryan S: They are going to critique you. <br/>Ooh, baby. <br/>Ryan S: Lillian, I think I’m her best friend at the moment. She  kind of looks at the other girls as trying to be cute and pretty and stuff.  And me and her go off and have a good time and talk and stuff. <br/>(Lillian gasps) <br/>Damn!  <br/>You are wonderful! We did it. Oh! Oh! Oh how cool are you?  <br/>Lill: The one person who befriended me with sincere friendship  was Ryan Shoulders. Ryan’s a good kid. <br/>Yeah I wish this stuff was drinkable already. <br/>Lill: I got an idea. We ain’t going to tell them where it’s at. <br/>Ryan S: I was just thinking that. <br/>(Rupert snoring) <br/>Burton: I’m a very active person. I don’t like to sit around  doing nothing. And we had this spear gun, and I looked around, I was like,  “Hey guys, I think I’m gonna go out.” <br/>Shawn: Have you used it before?  <br/>Burton: Oh yeah. <br/>Burton: Shawn went with me, and we went out and we were swimming  around and we got out into this huge mess of fish, just all over the  place.  <br/>Shawn: Burton had the spear at first, then next thing I know, he  cocks it. And all of a sudden, we got a fish. <br/>(tribe cheering) <br/>All right! Nice work, guys. <br/>You know, he’s going to be tasty.  <br/>Shawn: I’m so excited that, you know, all right, this thing  works. We can do this. <br/>That is awesome.  <br/>Jon: Mmm. <br/>Rupert: It feels great to be able to catch food, but I knew that  one fish wasn’t going to be enough, so I took the spear. So, I start catching  fish.  <br/>Rupert: Oh, I got lunch! <br/>Yeah! Whoo-hoo!  <br/>Rupert: After I got that, I thought, “Okay, some more. Some  more.” <br/>Is that a catfish?  <br/>I was thrilled. I’ve never seen a saltwater catfish. I didn’t  know they made such an animal. <br/>Burton: You just got another one? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Sandra: He’s going out again? <br/>Burton: He’s going to hurt himself.  <br/>Shawn: Hey Rupert. Good job on those fish, man.  <br/>Rupert: One, two, three, four, five. Three more.  <br/>Man, I hate to see Rupert out there. Geez. Wow, you’re getting  burned on your shoulders, Rupert. You look like you’re kind of getting red. <br/>I got to the point where I thought I was going to get eight of  them. Everybody was going to get their own fish. I didn’t get eight, but we  got us fish. <br/>You know what? That’s the best one you caught, right there. That  one is. <br/>No, the other one. <br/>This guy?  <br/>I know if I could have caught more of these… <br/>No, not that one, the other one. That one. <br/>That one’s a good one. <br/>Shawn: Rupert’s definitely a huge asset. I mean, he worked his  ass off, but he was beat. I mean, it took him hours just to recover from  that. <br/>Sandra: Man, you are red.  <br/>Rupert: I… I am burning up.  <br/>Rupert: I had a great day. I don’t know if I can keep up the  workload that I’m putting on myself, but that’s what I told myself I was  gonna do. I’m coming out here to be the caretaker. I’m trying to make these  people believe that there is no way you can get along without me, and I think  I’m doing it. <br/>Compliments to the catcher today. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Rupert: Everyone did great. Everyone did great. <br/>Nicole: There’s mail.  <br/>Ryan S: Dude, it’s our first mail. I guess let’s bring it back  and show them. <br/>Great. <br/>Darrah: We have tree mail! <br/>Tijuana: We got tree mail!  <br/>Ryan S: Mail, fools. <br/>Whoo!  <br/>Read it out loud. <br/>Here we go. You’ve finally arrived and so now it’s on. Your  first challenge is a test of your brains and your brawn. Like pirates of old,  it’s the treasure you thirst. But no booty will be had, if you’re voted out  first. <br/>Tijuana: You know what booty that is. (laughing) <br/>Andrew: Hey, I was thinking for this challenge, seriously, the  challenge probably won’t last very long. So, if we just focus for whatever,  15, 20 minutes…  <br/>Ryan S: The very first moment Andrew gave the presence of a  leader, nobody challenged it. <br/>Should we maybe appoint a leader? <br/>Everything, everything. <br/>Nicole: Someone that just calls the shots so we don’t get stuck  fighting? It makes no difference to me who it is, but… <br/>We need you. <br/>Yeah, Andrew. <br/>Nicole: I made a suggestion just because I knew I didn’t want to  be the leader, but I knew that we needed somebody, so we appointed Andrew  ahead of time as our leader before the challenge. <br/>Let’s do it now, then. Let’s go out there. <br/>Andrew: The Morgan Tribe, I think, is very ready for the challenge.  Biggest concern from my standpoint, from our tribe is, uh, Osten was having  difficulty with his shorts last couple of days, staying up. The crack of his  bottom kept showing, and we said, during any activity against the other  tribe, if his shorts go down, Ryan and I told him that, uh, we’re a team,  we’re a family, and we won’t make him embarrassed by being nude, so we’ll uh,  do the same.   <br/>Come on in guys. Everybody good? Let’s get to today’s challenge.  One of the things the pirates had to do with all the loot that they plundered  is protect it. So, that often meant moving from one island to another, and,  in the process, they would have to transport their artillery. That’s what you  guys are going to do today. You’re going to transport the cannons behind you  through a series of obstacles along a jungle course. First, you’re going to  take apart your cannon, get it through two fences blocking the path. Next,  you’ll hit the rock garden, where you’ll have to clear a path to move your  cannon forward to a third obstacle, where you’re going to have to push, pull,  and drag your cannon through a mud pit blocked by wooden barriers. Finally,  it’s a race along the shoreline to the finish. One person will carry the  tribe flag, one person will carry the torch. First tribe to reach the finish  line with all eight members and their cannon intact wins immunity. Want to  get a look at the immunity idol? <br/>Yeah. Yeah. <br/>The most valuable thing in your 39 days is this right here. <br/>(applause) <br/>Okay. Big enough stakes. Win this challenge, you’re here for  three more days, you’re safe. Lose, somebody from your tribe will be the  first person voted out at Tribal Council. Give you a couple minutes to  strategize, wait for my go. <br/>Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go! Move it, move it, move it! <br/>Lill: Come on, we’re right behind them. <br/>Jeff: Drake out to an early lead. <br/>Shawn: We’ve got to take this apart. That’s the only thing…  Apart. <br/>Jeff: Guys, you’re going to have to take apart your cannons to  get it through the fence.  <br/>Just push it.  <br/>Pull the cart all the way up. <br/>Watch your feet! This thing’s going to fall. Watch your feet!  Break it up. <br/>Jeff: All wheels are gonna have to come off to get through  there. Once everybody’s through there, you can move on through the other one.  Let’s go, Morgan!  You’re falling behind. <br/>Let’s go! One, two, three! Lift ya up. <br/>Okay, let’s go. <br/>Ho-Hold on. Hold on. Hold back!  <br/>All right! <br/>Jeff: Drake through first, still in the lead. <br/>Walk it. Walk it. <br/>Get that log! Get that log!  <br/>We got to move this. <br/>All the rocks?  <br/>Dude, we can’t move all those rocks. <br/>Jeff: Let’s go Drake, you’ve got Morgan on your heels. Ryan and  Osten talking strategy. <br/>Osten: My shorts keep falling down. Let’s all take ours  off.  <br/>Jeff: What are you guys doing? Osten, you are a first, my man--  a totally nude challenge. We have two naked Morgan members and they are not  the guys anybody wants to see.  <br/>Sandra: They better hope they don’t lose their weenies out here. <br/>Ryan S: Move some rocks, jerks! <br/>Jeff: Great. Now Andrew’s naked.  <br/>Let’s go guys! <br/>Jeff: Game is back on! You got a long way left, guys. It’s going  to be a great race. <br/>Run around and clear it.  <br/>Jeff: Drake still in the lead, still controlling the place. <br/>Go! Go! Go! <br/>If you guys can get out of the way…  <br/>Push it! Push it! Right, right, left, left.  <br/>Look out. Go right ahead <br/>Good. Come on guys. Push. <br/>(grunting) Watch out! Watch out. Watch out.  <br/>Come through. Come through.  <br/>Jeff: Let’s go, Morgan! Keep it up. <br/>Jeff: Through the flags! Through the flags! The cannons are  heavy, guys, they are going to drag in the sand, you’re gonna have to work  hard to make it to the finish. Let’s go, Drake, don’t waste this lead! Drake  is bogged down. <br/>Come on, we can do it! We’re beating ‘em.  <br/>Come on, pull! Watch out, guys!  <br/>Jeff: Keep going! Morgan’s taken the lead!  <br/>Push, push, push. <br/>Come on Morgan! <br/>Jeff: It’s a sprint to the finish! First tribe to cross with all  eight members and their cannon together wins immunity. Now Morgan’s bogged  down. Here comes Drake, back in the lead! Down to the finish! Gotta get  through here, through here Jon, through here!  <br/>Get up! Push!  <br/>Jeff: Drake wins immunity! <br/>And we didn’t even have to get naked! <br/>Jeff: Congratulations. <br/>Drake, Drake, Drake, Drake, Drake, Drake, Drake! Sweet! <br/>Jeff: Morgan, great effort, down to the end. Unfortunately, it  wasn’t enough. Next time I see you, it’ll be Tribal Council. Somebody’s going  home. You have the night to think about it.  <br/>Drake! <br/>I think it looks so pretty on there. <br/>Rupert: When they passed us… oh dude, I was ready to puke and  cry.  <br/>Shawn: When we won that challenge, we beat them not on brute  strength alone, but we beat them on, on basically in my opinion, willpower.  They gave up. And we didn’t. You know, we almost did, but we didn’t. And I  think that’s why we made it to the end.  <br/>Burton: Dude, just too many naked men behind us.  <br/>Michelle: At the immunity challenge, I looked back and I saw one  guy with his junk just hanging out, just like you know, nobody’s business.  And that, I was like, “Whoa! I shouldn’t be looking.” <br/>Michelle: Their asses were in my face. <br/>Yeah!  <br/>So just say you looked. Did you enjoy it? <br/>Sandra: I wasn’t impressed. I don’t know what was going on with  them. I wish their ding-a-lings got stuck on a vine, or I don’t know. That  was just stupid. <br/>Rupert: Do you know why the boys took their panties off? <br/>Dude, I have no idea.  <br/>Rupert: When I turned around and saw them idiots bouncing around  naked in the mud and the muck and the stickers and the thorns, it was  hilarious.  <br/>The coolest thing is, thank God we don’t have to send anyone  home tonight.  <br/>Yeah. <br/>‘Cause that would have sucked. <br/>Rupert: Exactly right. <br/>Andrew: You know, that sucked, any way you look at it. We lost  by about a foot. We learn from it. We move on, and we kick their butt the  next time. And we remember how cocky they were when they won. All right? <br/>Tijuana Hey guys. We were just talking and just thinking about… <br/>Andrew: You were? What were you talking about? <br/>Tijuana: We were just thinking about, obviously, tonight.  <br/>You ladies saw what we saw.  <br/>What did you see?  <br/>Andrew: I saw our friend Ryan, who’s back at the camp, just quit  about a third of the way in. And everytime I looked over, he said, “What?”  It’s like…  <br/>Tijuana: With Lilly, I mean, she works hard when it comes to the  fire and the water, but we all can do fire and water.  <br/>Andrew: I think it’s a big mistake if we expect other challenges  to be less strenuous. So the question is, is Lilly up for that? Or are we  better off with the limp noodle, Ryan?  <br/>Lill: Well I don’t fit in here with the girls, I don’t fit in  with the boys. <br/>Ryan S: Hang in there. This thing changes every day. <br/>Lill: I took the challenge loss, I think the hardest, because I feel  like I am going to be encouraged to leave.  <br/>Ryan S: When your torch goes out, then give up.  <br/>Lill: Alright. <br/>Ryan S: ‘Cause it’s over then. Not until then.  <br/>Lill: I think my teammates like me, but someone has to go.  <br/>Do you want to try and crack one of them?  <br/>Lill: No one else has said “Side with me,” other than  Nicole.  <br/>Nicole: Uh, Lill, I think Tijuana is the person that I think  needs to be taken care of quickly. And at this point, while we’re still  building the shelter, we don’t want to get rid of any of the guys. Truth…  truth be told, I like all of them.  <br/>Lill: Nicole came to me, and she wants to get rid of Tijuana.  You know, okay. Why?  <br/>Lill: This is what went on for me. Nicole comes to me, she tells  me, let’s get rid of Tijuana. <br/>Andrew: What? That’s a hell of a strategy.  <br/>Lill: She says she’s bugging her, da da da. “Will you help me?”  And I’m going, geez, you know, that didn’t sound too cool. <br/>Andrew: Lilly, I had… had some conversations with her, and I  believe everything she says. I don’t think she has a dishonest bone in her  body. <br/>Andrew (to Tijuana): Lill said Nicole came to her and said,  “Will you form an alliance with me to vote off Tijuana.”  <br/>Tijuana: Are you serious? <br/>Andrew: Nicole approached Lilly because apparently Tijuana was  being too bossy and was annoying Nicole.  <br/>Tijuana: Are you serious? She told me that Lill went to her. So  she blamed it on Lill, and it’s Nicole that’s doing it. <br/>Andrew: Lill has not denied it. Lill just tells you the truth. <br/>Andrew: We’re just trying to figure out who said what to whom  and whether Nicole can be trusted.  <br/>Ooh. Ooh. That pisses me off. <br/>Tijuana: What I had to do is find out is Nicole lying, was she  really trying to put me on the cutting block? I really believe that she was.  I think Lill… I just don’t think she has a reason to lie.  <br/>Tijuana: All I want to know is who’s backstabbing me. <br/>Nicole: Nobody’s backstabbing you, nobody’s voting for you. <br/>Tijuana: Somebody obviously is. <br/>Nicole: I did talk to Lillian to get rid of Tijuana, but word  got out of that because Lill’s freaked out that she’s getting voted off  tonight, so she’s telling everybody. I set myself up in a really bad  position, because telling some truths, telling some half-truths, and trying  to get things to go my way. <br/>She approached me. Somebody’s lying. It’s either Lill or it’s  you. And that’s not a good thing because who knows when you’re going to be  talked about or lied about? <br/>Darrah: I was getting along with Nicole there for a little  while, which I still am, but you know, now I don’t know if I can trust  her.  <br/>Nicole: You’ve made me feel very uncomfortable in this  situation. <br/>Tijuana: You’re not listening. He told me. I didn’t create it,  he told me, so I came directly to you. I didn’t want to make a judgment call,  I wanted to ask you. <br/>Nicole: If you don’t trust me, and if you think I’m out to get  people, why would you want to have an alliance? <br/>Tijuana: I want to trust you. That’s why I’m asking you. <br/>Tijuana: As far as Nicole, I think it is enemy status. It’s  gotten to that point. I can’t trust her. So, yeah, she’s definitely an enemy.  She came right off the bat trying to take me down. For what purposes? For  what?  <br/>Andrew: The people that I think are at risk... <br/>You’re hungry aren’t you? <br/>Andrew: …are Skinny Ryan. I don’t think he’s been pulling his  weight at camp or at the challenge. Nicole, with the high drama today, she’s  been labeled in some people’s eyes as being dishonest, and uh, so her neck’s  on the line, because we don’t think we can trust her. And Lilly, is her neck  on the chopping block? Yeah, she’s definitely a contender to be voted out  tonight. <br/>Jeff: I want you to grab a torch and approach a flame. Dip your  torch in and get fire. This is part of the ritual at Tribal Council because  fire represents your life on the island and in this game. When your fire is  gone, so are you. Put your torches back in their slot and have a seat.  Welcome to your first Tribal Council. Not the palace you want to be. But, uh,  before we get to the vote, let’s talk about the challenge, the reason you  guys are here tonight. It’s one thing to get naked for no apparent reason and  win, but it’s another thing entirely to have three guys walking around naked  and lose a challenge. Any regrets about that? <br/>Osten: Absolutely not. Not a regret. What’s in the past is in  the past. We did it, and we move on, period. <br/>Jeff: So how has it been, Ryan? How are the first three days of  getting along with these people that you didn’t know? <br/>The first three days have been good. I get along with everybody.  Everybody’s really cool, everybody’s really helpful, but… food, I could care  less about. The water aspect, I’m struggling a little bit. <br/>Jeff: Andrew, has water been the toughest part? <br/>No. Uh, I’m very hydrated. For me, it’s the sleep. I haven’t had  more than 45 minutes of sleep the last three nights. <br/>Jeff: Why? <br/>Andrew: Well, we built a fashionable hut and we put a floor  down. And the poles were uneven, so that didn’t work very well. So we didn’t  quite get the job done. <br/>Jeff: Lill, you’re a scoutmaster right? It’s not just  decorative. <br/>Lill: No, it’s hard-earned, it’s 11 years of being Scoutmaster  of troop 617 in Cincinnati, Ohio.  <br/>Jeff: And has that served you well out here? <br/>Lill: It has served me well out here. It has also given me  patience. You can’t work with a bunch of young children without having  patience, so I’m patient. <br/>Jeff: Let’s talk about friendships. How about you Nicole?  Friendships out here? <br/>Nicole: Um, I think I Have some social friendships, but I don’t  think, I think it’s too early to trust anybody. I’ve already seen several  sides of a few people, just when questioned or when threatened, I’ve seen  people that are normally very cheerful and very positive turn very defensive,  um, having me feel funny, that was from the very first day.  <br/>Jeff: Has anybody emerged as a leader that… that you guys are  looking to now to make decisions, Lill? <br/>Lill: Um… Andrew is our leader. We’ve elected him as a team, and  he’s done an excellent job. He’s willing to listen to each one of us, and I  like that in leadership. <br/>Jeff: Andrew, as the leader, anybody here not pulling their  weight? <br/>Andrew: Young Ryan, at the challenge, we were side by side, I’m  pulling the left-hand side, and he didn’t wake up and show me the passion  that we needed. So yeah, I don’t think he was pulling his weight. <br/>Jeff: So Ryan, first three days, you been pulling your weight? <br/>Ryan S: I know there has been some talk among some people that I  didn’t give my 110% at the immunity challenge, and I thought I was giving  120%. If they say me otherwise, that’s fine, we’ll go on. <br/>Jeff: Okay. It is time to vote. Nicole, you’re up first.  <br/>Nicole: Ryan S, I’m voting for you because you’re the only  person I know other people are planning to vote for.  <br/>Tijuana: Nicole, you stabbed me in the back. Fortunately, I  found out, and I was able to save myself.  <br/>Jeff: I’ll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the  decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal  Council area immediately. I’ll read the votes. First vote, Nicole. Ryan S.  One vote Ryan, one vote Nicole. Nicole. Two votes Nicole, one vote Ryan.  Three votes Nicole. Nicole. That’s four votes Nicole. The first person voted  out of the Pearl Islands, Nicole. Need to bring me your torch. Nicole, the  tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Jeff: Judging from tonight’s Tribal Council, it’s clear a couple  of you certainly thought that it could have been your torch. So maybe the  thing to be learned is that you are not out of this game until your torch is  snuffed. Keep that in your head over the next 36 days. You can always save  yourselves. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night.  <br/>Next time on Survivor. At Drake, life is good until Shawn causes  Rupert to lose his cool.  <br/>Rupert: That’s why I wanted to be the only one… who did  that.  <br/>(Rupert yelling) <br/>And a member of the Morgan tribe wants to quit. <br/>Andrew: We don’t need people just walking around, “I don’t… I  want to go home.” It’s a real morale killer for the tribe.  <br/>Nicole: I knew going in that my biggest weakness was going to be  keeping my mouth shut. When I have an opinion about somebody, I can’t just  seem to keep it in. Um, based on past experiences in my life, it doesn’t  surprise me that I’m sitting here. I knew I’d either be the first person off  or the person that won. So, it was one of the toughest things I’ve ever done.  And even with a million dollars at stake, I still had to say what I thought  when I thought it. And that’s exactly what did me in, I sort of shot myself  in the foot by trying to make an alliance early on to get rid of someone that  was just annoying me, um, which I see now in hindsight is probably not the best  way to play the game.
