<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: 18 castaways were cut off from the world  by miles of empty savannah and endless jungles filled with wild creatures. But the fiercest predator in Gabon was the yellow tribe... Kota wins immunity  and reward! ...who systematically devoured the weak and struggling red tribe Fang. <br/>It's tough having to deal with the losses over and over again. It starts to make you feel like you might not ever win. <br/>Probst: We are picking new tribes. <br/>What?! <br/>No, no, no. <br/>Probst: On day ten, a tribe swap gave Fang the opportunity to improve  themselves. <br/>I'm going to go with Kelly. <br/>Probst: But they continued to be their own worst enemy by foolishly picking  weak players over stronger ones. That may be the most surprising decision in ten days out here. At the end of the tribe swap, Sugar, the pinup model, wasn't chosen and was  sent on her second trip to Exile Island. <br/>I already have the idol, so I chose comfort. (chuckles)  Probst: At the immunity challenge, former Fang member Randy, the wedding  videographer...  Whoo! <br/>Probst: Randy scores for Kota! ...made every point in a 3-0 blowout of his old tribe. Kota wins immunity! By day 12, Fang had hit an all-time low. <br/>It was like we were legless chickens racing against sleek weasels. <br/>Probst: And faced with the choice to vote out a strong member-- Jacquie-- or  a weak one-- Kelly-- they acted as though they had a death wish and weakened  their tribe yet again. Jacquie, the tribe has spoken. And Ace lost one of his closest allies. 14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>The whole tribal thing is a trip. <br/>Uh, sure. <br/>Is she here? <br/>No, but she's coming. <br/>Right now? <br/>Uh, Tribal didn't pan out the way I expected. Jacquie got the boot, and now I'm sort of sitting a little high and dry. <br/>No. <br/>I think they were scared about me having any strength in my alliance with  Jacquie. Maybe now I will be able to pull off some sort of coup de grace once again  with, uh, Sugar. She's back from Exile Island. One of Sugar's biggest pluses is the fact that she has the immunity idol  tucked up her sleeve, and I've got Sugar in my pocket. <br/>Hey. <br/>Hi. Hello. <br/>Welcome back. <br/>Yeah. So that means Jacquie's gone. <br/>Yep. <br/>That sucks. My very first thought when I saw that it was the new Fang tribe was,  "Yay, I get to see Jacquie and Ace." But instead, I saw Kelly, and  that was a big surprise. I hate Tribal Council. Luckily, it was dark, so maybe I could have hidden some of my disappointment. <br/>Is Exile Island, uh, cool? <br/>It was this time. <br/>It's a cool place? It was inside the Sugar Shack. <br/>It's a cool place? <br/>Yeah, it's not bad. <br/>So the clue was pretty hard to find, huh, for the idol? <br/>Uh, I-I don't know. I gave up after three clues the first time, so...  It's called the Sugar Shack now. (chuckles)  Sugar, Sugar, Sugar. She's been out to Exile Island the longest. She's had plenty of time to look for the idol. And I feel in my heart she has the idol. So I got to get rid of her. (theme song playing) Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION  *  Oh, my gosh. <br/>Oh, yeah, yeah. There's another guy down there. Oh, there's, like, two, three, dude. <br/>Oh, my God. We're eating this morning. <br/>All right! <br/>I think we have, like, four really good-sized tilapia in here. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Yay! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Look how big that one is. <br/>So many fish. <br/>Ow! That guy right there. <br/>It'll shock you if you touch him. <br/>Grab a hold of him. <br/>Oh, damn, you're right! In addition to the gill net, Bob checked the traps, and he had a shocking  surprise, which was literal. It was this little fish. He's about four inches long. And every time you pick him up, he sends a little electric charge through  your hand. <br/>Ooh, he can-- I felt it through my fingers. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, that's it. <br/>That was weird. <br/>Randy. <br/>Dude, we got five. <br/>We have five, like...  Look how big they are. <br/>Huge fish. <br/>Good-sized tilapia. <br/>It's unbelievable. Man, that's a nice drag. <br/>Yeah, that was a big one. <br/>Dan, myself, and Susie, uh, got picked to be in this new Kota tribe. It's-it's wonderful. I can't believe it. Gill net worked-- unreal. Fish, beans, corn. Way, way better than Fang. So I have no complaints. Beautiful. Kota welcomed the three Fang members very, very fast into the tribe, but if  they had to vote somebody out right now, they'd vote the old Fang people out. But, uh, you know, I'll work on them. When they say to adapt, they mean to adapt, and this crusty old man can do it. (elephants trumpeting) (trumpeting) (deep growling breaths)  (whispers): Hey, hey, hey, hey, everybody, everybody. Everybody come here. Everybody come here... Everybody come here. Be quiet. <br/>It's an elephant, huh? <br/>Right there. Right there. Right at the bottom. There he is. See him? (elephant trumpeting)  Whoa. <br/>That is so cool. <br/>Look how big his tusks are. <br/>I know. That's crazy. They could be, like, right in our camp, and we wouldn't be able to see them  at nighttime. <br/>Looks crazy. (elephant trumpeting) Oh, here, he's gonna rip something. <br/>Ooh. <br/>Yo. <br/>That's crazy. Look at him. He's beautiful. <br/>Oh! <br/>Whoa! <br/>Oh. (excited chattering) (oohing)  Damn! (trumpeting) (gasping)  God. <br/>Huge! <br/>He's lifting, he's lifting up stuff so he can throw it. Look at him. Look at him. Look at him! <br/>Ah! <br/>Come on, shh. <br/>No. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Good luck and God bless. <br/>Good luck, don't get killed. We need you. <br/>Have fun. <br/>This frigging elephant in the jungle, it's here in our camp, and it's among  us all day because we hear him all day. But you can't necessarily see him all the time. And to actually see one and put the face to the noise, it's magnificent. <br/>Oh, my God. The brave boys. <br/>Yep. (leaves rustling) (branch cracks) (elephant trumpeting)  Oh, he's going that way. <br/>Seeing that elephant today really made me... step out of the game for a  second. It just makes you appreciate the simplicity of life and the, and the pure  things, and... it makes you appreciate Gabon. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! How's it going, Kota? <br/>Good. <br/>Great. <br/>Probst: Kota, getting your first look at the new Fang tribe. Jacquie voted out at the last Tribal Council. <br/>They got rid of Jacquie? <br/>Oh! <br/>Guys, let's focus on the challenge. We'll talk about it later. <br/>Probst: A lot of reactions on Kota. Surprised? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Definitely, especially given her effort yesterday. So pretty shocking. <br/>Probst: Fang is once again a new tribe. Sugar has joined the Fang tribe, and the numbers are now even. All right, you guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: All right, for today's challenge, each tribe will start with a large  pile of fruit. On my go, you will toss the fruit to tribe members through the holes in two  walls while members of the other tribe use wooden clubs and attempt to whack  that fruit out of the air. Once a piece of fruit hits the ground, you can't pick it up. The fruit will be weighed at the end, and the tribe that manages to collect  the most fruit at the end of five minutes wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: You've been out here 13 days. Your taste buds are screaming for something new. Today's reward will satisfy that craving. Your own herb garden. <br/>That's awesome. <br/>Awesome. <br/>Probst: That you can keep living and keep replenishing. Also got some salt and oil. In addition, whatever fruit you catch, yours to keep. <br/>That's pretty good, too. <br/>Probst: Worth playing for? <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: All right, give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. On defense, wielding the club for Fang, we have Crystal at the front net. Ace at the back net. For Kota, Bob is at the front net. Charlie is at the back net. Here we go. Survivors ready? Go! It's gotta go through the holes, and you have to catch it. Danny catches one right away. He gets denied by Ace. <br/>Go, G! <br/>Come on! Oh, my God, GC! Throw it high! High! <br/>Yo, Matty. <br/>Probst: Matty's caught something. Tries to fake out Charlie! He does! Kenny has it! Fang first on the board! Corinne with the left-handed toss gets denied. Dan has another. Gets it rejected right back to him. It's a showdown. <br/>Out of here! <br/>Probst: Kota's gotta figure out how to get by Ace if they're gonna score. Matty has another for Fang. Another fake on Charlie, and he gets it through again, and Kenny catches it  again! Fang with an early lead. <br/>Crystal, do not let anything through. <br/>Probst: Dan has two pieces of fruit. Ace doing a great job with that club. <br/>This is so fun. <br/>Probst: Different story for Fang. Matty is working Charlie. Another big Matty-to-Kenny connection. That combination is giving Fang a big lead right now. <br/>Dan, throw two pieces at once. <br/>Probst: Dan has two pieces of fruit. That one connects. A little banana doesn't weigh much. Dan connects with Randy. <br/>Atta boy, Dan, perfect. <br/>Probst: Kota starting to get the hang of it now. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Fang continues to make connections with those smaller pieces of fruit. Dan has half a watermelon and a pineapple. Catches the half a watermelon. That's a lot of weight. Matty to Kenny continues to work. Two minutes left. Big reception by Randy! Kota making a good comeback. <br/>Got it! <br/>Probst: Huge pineapple caught by Kenny. <br/>Wait for Dan! Wait for Dan! <br/>Probst: Waiting on that left hand. There it is. Both baskets look pretty full. 45 seconds left. We are neck-and-neck. Dan has a watermelon and a pineapple. Annihilates Ace. The good news is, Ace, nothing got through. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: We're in the final seconds of this challenge. It is very close. You need to make those last pieces of fruit count. Ten seconds left! Five, four, three, two, one. That's it! Challenge is over! <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Like that where you guys had going two at a time. That was awesome. <br/>Probst: Good effort. Very close. We'll start with Fang. We're gonna weigh to see who has the most weight. 16 pounds for Fang. <br/>Not bad. <br/>Probst: Kota, you gotta have 16 pounds and an ounce. You're at ten. Kota just under 15 pounds. <br/>Come on! Come on. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: This is what you have left. By two pounds, Kota wins reward. (all cheering) All right, Kota, now you have another big decision to make. Which member of Fang are you sending to Exile Island? <br/>She might as well have the mail forwarded there 'cause Sugar's going again. (Sugar laughs)  That's all right. I've already named it the "Sugar Shack."  Probst: Dan, why sending Sugar again? <br/>Just strategy. Purely comedy. <br/>Wow. (Sugar laughing)  No, no, because we think if she finds the idol, she'd had to play it before  the merge, and we'd like it to get back into circulation. <br/>Whatever. <br/>Probst: I know you don't need the map. You could probably show me where it is better. <br/>Bye. <br/>Probst: Sugar will return in time for the next immunity challenge. Fang, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Kota, congratulations. Come get your reward. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Yes, thank you. *  Wow, guys, the plants are okay. They're getting water for that. <br/>We just got back from our reward challenge with all of our new fruits and  vegetables, and so spirits are high around here, but I feel bad for those  Fang members because I know all they're eating is rice with no flavor, and we  have tons and tons of food here. <br/>Life is good. <br/>The rich are definitely getting richer here at Kota. <br/>All right, so, instead of the Axis of Evil, we now have the Evil Empire, guys. And I think we need to keep our numbers and stick together once the merge  comes. I'm gonna need all seven of you guys. We're gonna have-- our first couple of votes after the merge are gonna have  to be unanimous. I'm an outspoken person and, and I tend to want to, um, get people's  adrenaline going. It's a game where you light a fire under people going up against, you know,  someone you can coin the "Evil Empire" absolutely gives us more  motivation to go in there and win, and not just win by a little, win by a lot. And once we get one or two out, they're gonna crumble, and our seven will go  further. <br/>The next immunity challenge is the most important of the game. I think everyone's on the same page about that. I think the biggest issue with Dan is he is so eager to express his undying,  complete, and total devotion to the new Kota tribe that no one believes him. <br/>Us seven, as long as we win the immunity challenges, and us seven stick  together, we're always gonna have the numbers on them. <br/>On the flip side, Susie's the opposite of Dan. She's so quiet that it makes you think that she's not quite as on board about  stuff that we've been talking about. We're now focused on the next 48 hours, which...  Crucial. <br/>...is the most important part of this game right now. I don't have the confidence that we get to the merge and these people have  got my back. <br/>Come and get your chunk. Wait, wait, where's Randy? <br/>Randy, get up here! <br/>All right. <br/>The challenge today was fun. Once again, Kota won, and did I kick ass or what? My plan right now is just continue to win challenges and not rock the boat,  and I will be Kota yellow to the end. <br/>When Kota sent me to Exile, they said it was for pure comedy sake, which is  hilarious 'cause I was thinking the joke's on you. Better than last time. Everybody else in the game is tired and starving and stinky and dirty as all  get-out, and I am living high on the hog in Eden all by myself with my own  lake and fruit and comfort, and I'm a very happy camper now. I have the idol, and I'd have to be really dumb to get sent home next. But I definitely am happy and fat. (laughs) (sighs)  Is that all the rice, that little bag right there? <br/>Yeah. There's about 13 grains of rice. We can all have two grains. <br/>Eat your rice. <br/>Don't tell me to do nothing. <br/>Eat your rice. <br/>Okay, Crystal. Don't tell me what I should be doing out here. <br/>Eat your rice. <br/>Shut your mouth! I'll tell you that much. I've been out here just a couple of weeks, and it's way more difficult than I  ever would have expected. Not only do you gotta win these challenges to-to live well out here, you  know, you gotta deal with these people day in and day out, 24/7. <br/>She is so annoying. <br/>It definitely plays tricks with your head, you know what I mean? And it's overwhelming at times. It's hard, and I do question, you know, what am I doing? <br/>Is GC sad or something? <br/>I don't know. I think so. <br/>Like he misses home or...? <br/>I don't know. <br/>They're cracking at the edges. The seams are going. This argument comes out of nowhere. I mean, it was brilliant. I couldn't have planned it better. I'm, like, "These people are just gonna implode." I was just  sitting back and enjoying it, you know? I was, like, "Oh, good, finally, something's gonna happen."  You know, I've kind of had enough with these people here. I need to just get back to real life because this game is-- I feel like  it's-- it's changing me, and it's not for the better. *  We got some mail. <br/>Doesn't look so fun. <br/>"The gravity of the situation is you really need to score. At least prevent the other tribe, or tonight you will lose one more."  I think we're inside of this. And it rolls down the hill. <br/>Okay, well, whatever it is. <br/>Today in the challenge, I think our chances are slim. This tribe's floating. This tribe is all over the place. People are starting to become affected big-time by the, uh, the elements out  here. GC's losing it. Crystal's bugging out. It's all over the place. It's a bunch of insanity. *  GC! (whistling loudly)  We were about to go to the challenge, and we couldn't find GC. Like, everybody was looking for him because we need our team there, and he  was off on his own, you know? <br/>Are you serious? We have to leave without him? <br/>Yeah. <br/>GC! <br/>What if he got eaten by, like, a monkey, dude? <br/>Hopefully, he comes back in time. But he doesn't like being told what to do. You know, that's just how he... how he rolls. <br/>I think we're gonna have to leave without him. <br/>Dude, this is gonna suck. Want to all scream at the same time? <br/>Okay, ready? One, two, three. <br/>GC! <br/>I'm, like, damn, they're using energy to yell right now. <br/>I agree. I-I'm not giving you any form of argument. <br/>I'm personally getting fed up with GC. He just throws these tantrums, and it is just upsetting to me, and I'm... I'm  just getting fed up with the tantrums from a grown adult. <br/>GC! <br/>I'm not going to the dock yelling after a grown man. <br/>GC? Did he not hear me? <br/>Why? We need you. *  Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Sugar, returning from Exile Island. You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yes. Yep. <br/>Probst: First things first. Dan, I will take back immunity. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, one member from each tribe will throw a ball down a  cliff through a series of obstacles while a blindfolded member of the other  tribe will use a shield and attempt to block that ball with the aid of a  caller. Your goal: get your ball past the defender and into a goal, scoring points  for your tribe. The goals represent different point values, five being the highest. The tribe with the most points at the end of five rounds is safe from Tribal  Council. Losers, you know what that means. Fifth person will be voted out of this game, and they will come from your  tribe. We'll get started. * All right, here we go. The defender for Fang is Ace. The caller is Sugar. The defender for Kota is Dan. The caller is Randy. First two throwers come up. Charlie and Matty, grab your ball and head up. Your goal is to launch this ball past the defender. Defender's job: stop it from going in the goal. Dan and Randy, you are stopping the red ball. Ace and Sugar, stopping the yellow ball. Go! <br/>Dan, 15 yards right! Dan, right, right, right! (indistinct shouts)  Probst: Kota scores two! <br/>Let it go! Let it go! <br/>Five, five, five, five, five! <br/>Probst: Fang scores five! <br/>Good job, man! <br/>Perfect! <br/>Probst: Bit of a learning curve down there. Don't get discouraged. <br/>Are you gonna come lead me back? Or am I just gonna stand here? <br/>(laughs): Sorry. <br/>Probst: Fang takes a big lead: 5-2. Next two throwers, head up. Susie throwing for Kota, GC for Fang. Go! <br/>Right! Right! <br/>Right! Right! Right! <br/>Forward a little! Forward a little! <br/>Probst: It blows right past Ace. Dan stops his. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Kota scores two more points! <br/>Yes! <br/>You did that perfectly. Just perfectly. <br/>Probst: Ace embarrassed. <br/>I can't see anything. You have to talk. <br/>I know. <br/>What's happening? <br/>Nothing's happening right now. <br/>No, not right this second. I can hear that. What's happening with the course? <br/>Probst: With that, Kota closes the gap. They're now down by one: 5-4. Next two throwers. <br/>Come on, Kelly! <br/>Probst: It's Marcus throwing for Kota, Kelly throwing for Fang. Go! <br/>Dan, two on your right! Dan, two on your right! <br/>Right, right, right, right! <br/>Left, Dan! Dan! Left right there! <br/>Left! Left! Right! <br/>Probst: The balls crossed each other, and Dan stops his own ball. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Fang scores two more points. <br/>All right, Kel! All right, Kel! <br/>Probst: Dan stopped his own tribe's ball. <br/>Hey, we're doing good, Ace! Good job, buddy! <br/>Probst: Poor communication for Kota. <br/>Just tell me to get out of the way. <br/>Probst: That mistake cost Kota. Fang now jumps ahead: 7-4. Next two throwers. It's Corinne for Kota, Crystal for Fang. Go! (grunts)  To your right! To your right! <br/>Okay, right in the middle. Stop, stop, stop. <br/>Okay, right there, Dan! <br/>Right, right, right, right! <br/>Probst: Kota slips right past Ace! <br/>Are you okay? <br/>Probst: Dan catches Fang, as Kota's gonna fall in... it does! Kota scores two! Fang's lead now back down to a single point. What happened? <br/>Shield in the face. <br/>Probst: Ace took a shield into the face. All right, here we go. Next two throwers. <br/>Probst: Here's where we stand: this is the fifth and final round. Fang has seven; Kota has six. One throw left. It's Bob for Kota, Kenny for Fang. This challenge is coming down to a single throw. <br/>I'm on it. <br/>Probst: Go! (grunts)  20 right! 20 right! 20...  Right, right, right! <br/>Right there! Right there! Yes, you got it! You got it! Yes, you got it! You got it! <br/>Probst: Dan stops Fang! <br/>Freeze, Ace, freeze, Ace, freeze! <br/>Right there, right there, right there! <br/>Probst: Oh, Randy pulls a fast one on Ace! And that'll do it! (cheering) Kota scores! Kota wins immunity! (whooping)  Nice work! <br/>Great job. <br/>Great job, Randy. Where are you? <br/>I'm here, man. <br/>All right. <br/>Probst: Kota, once again, immunity is yours. And, Fang, once again, a date with me at Tribal Council. This will be the fifth Tribal Council. You've been my guests at four of them. All right, guys, grab your stuff. Head back to camp. * *  Good job, you guys. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We lost another immunity challenge today. It's gonna be our fourth time visiting Tribal Council tonight, and, um,  nobody's looking forward to it. <br/>(laughs) We're the unlucky...  This camp is cursed. <br/>Bad news. <br/>I've noticed. <br/>I want to get back on my grind and focus on, you know, what's gonna make me  happy, man. Seriously, man. <br/>It's all good. Just trust me. <br/>You ask to leave this game, man, and it's, people pounce on that. <br/>That's bull. I don't want to hear that. I don't want to hear it. Does he think we're going to be like, "Oh, please stay. Please stay"? If you wanna (no audio) go, go. <br/>I know. <br/>I'm not kissing ass for, "Oh, please stay."  What do we do now? <br/>If that's what he wants, that's what he wants. I'm voting for GC, hands down. When we elected him leader, he quit at that. He's quit at the challenges and now he wants to quit the game. To me, he's a loser. I have no respect for people like that that's just gonna quit. Being out here that long, starving, is a mind game in itself. So, that's where I stand. <br/>Whatever. He's going home tonight. <br/>Good. <br/>We're voting out GC. <br/>I trust you. You're paying attention. <br/>Well, you know, we're gonna be (indistinct) to merge in a tribe that we were  dead. Letting them destroy themselves is very pleasurable to watch. Not this time, but at a certain point, I might call upon you to use the idol. <br/>You haven't told anybody, have you? <br/>No, nobody knows. <br/>Okay, good, sweet. <br/>Have you hid the idol? <br/>Yeah, it's in my bag, but nobody thinks I have it. Nobody's going in there. <br/>I'm looking. I'm looking. <br/>Let me see. It can't be that small. <br/>You're not looking! Keep a lookout. Otherwise we'll get in trouble. <br/>I knew she had it. I knew she had it the first...  That's why she's so confident. <br/>Right. <br/>Tonight is the only night to blindside her. That's the freaking... she is the most dangerous person right now in this  game. <br/>So, now we all know that Sugar has the hidden immunity idol, and it really  changes things because nobody really wants to keep GC here longer, but right  now everybody's scared of that idol. <br/>Dude, I don't have time for quitters but the idol, that's like, more intense. (tribal singing)  Probst: Let's talk about the wear and tear so far. Ace, are you starting to notice the impact of being out here for 15 days now? <br/>Uh, a little bit. I can see it when, you know, people are running out of belt loops and, you  know, things that were tight before are suddenly falling off. So, yeah, you can notice it, really. <br/>Probst: GC, the belt loop's got to be referring to you. <br/>Yeah, it's definitely hard, um, not eating, you know, the the type of foods  that you're used to eating. It definitely takes a toll on you physically and mentally. But more than the material things, you start to think what's more important  to you. Is it staying out here and starving and dealing with personalities and losing  challenges, and it's definitely hard when you just think about, you know, how  much you could just love to be with your family and your friends, you know,  and, and how often you take it for granted. <br/>Probst: Sugar, have you heard GC talking about home? <br/>I've only spent this afternoon with everybody, so, I really, uh, I know that  he's feeling like he wants to go soon and, uh...  Probst: Like he wants to go soon? Like go home? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: So, GC, you've talked about going home. <br/>I, you know, I haven't had the easiest life, man. And I've suffered all growing up and just being out here, it's like, I'm kind  of done suffering. You know what I mean? I realize what's important to me. But I definitely feel like, you know, it's... it's hard. <br/>Probst: And right on cue, Sugar, you're crying. <br/>Well, I think we all feel this way. I mean, we all miss home and everything and we are all being nasty sometimes. Like, it's weird turning on people, and I don't think any of us like that too  much. So, it's probably hardest on our psyche than physically. <br/>Probst: Matty, tough to hear a tribe mate talk about wanting to go home? 'Cause it's gonna affect all of you in one way or another if you're out here  long enough. <br/>You know what? There's just... There's no quitting. You can't give yourself that option. Even though you're hurting right now, that's the answer. You cannot give yourself that option. <br/>Probst: Sugar, let's talk about your experience out here. You've spent more time on Exile than you have at the Kota or the Fang camp. How concerned are you that I'm clearly somebody that might be going home  because I don't even know anybody? <br/>Right. I kind of feel like it could be me. I am the one that knows the least about these people and they know the least  about me. So, it could just as easily be me tonight, so, I brought my bag. <br/>Probst: Kenny, is it a little frustrating that Sugar keeps getting sent to  Exile? There's something extremely valuable out there. <br/>Um, yeah, I'm sure it comes to everybody's mind that, you know, maybe she  found it, but nobody knows unless she's told people. But it is very frustrating. <br/>Probst: So, what kind of strategy, Sugar, goes through your mind, whether you  have the idol or not? Do I let them know I have the idol? Do I convince them I don't have the idol? <br/>Nobody really asked me if I had the idol, actually. <br/>Probst: Does that strike you as odd? <br/>No, not considering that you're allowed to go through people's bags. So, no, it doesn't surprise me. <br/>Probst: So, you think your bag has been gone through or you don't know? <br/>I don't know. <br/>Probst: Do you keep your bag with you? <br/>Nope. I keep it out where anybody can go through it if they want. <br/>Probst: Crystal, crazy to leave your bag out or crazy smart? <br/>Crazy to leave your bag out. <br/>Probst: Sugar, do you really truly not care if people know you have the idol? <br/>Maybe there's a sense of power in knowing that, you know, somebody has the  idol and maybe you don't want to vote against them because they might use it  to vote you out. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to vote. Sugar, you're up. <br/>I'm only voting for you because you want to go home and I'm really sorry  because I think you're a really cool person. <br/>My vote is for Kelly because I had to vote for somebody. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: GC. GC. Two votes GC. Kelly. Two votes GC; one vote Kelly. GC. Three votes GC. Fifth person voted out of Survivor: Gabon: GC. That's four; that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. GC, your tribe has spoken. You guys have endured a lot in your first 15 days. One thing is for certain: you are going to have to dig deep if you're going  to last in this game. Grab your torches and head back to camp. Good night.

Until merge, on your girl, you're not gonna stab me in the back. <br/>I made a pact with Ace. <br/>Deal. <br/>Deal. <br/>This is going to be the start of a great run for me. I have complete supremacy. <br/>For all the people who, who might say that I quit or I just gave up, call it  what you want. The back-stabbing and the lying, that's the part that I really didn't agree  with. I never expected it to be this hard. The vote for Kelly was the throwaway vote. She was the one who I connected with the least. I got the utmost respect for anybody who makes it, who even tries out, and  whoever has walked in my shoes.
