<br/> Jeff: This is Nicaragua:  Remote, mysterious, Dangerous. Straddled between the raging waters of the pacific ocean and the caribbean  sea. It's where ancient rain forests battle for survival against some of the  world's youngest and most active volcanos. This rugged land has resisted taming since the days of the conquistadors. And it is where 20 americans have already begun the adventure of a lifetime. <br/>Everywhere you look  there's monkeys hanging from things. There's Dangerous animals here. It's like... It's real. There's no fences like the zoo. <br/>I'm Jimmy Johnson. I'm 66 years old and I've won two collegiate national championships. I've won two superbowls. What could top it off better than to win "Survivor"? <br/>Jeff: They think  they've already been divided into two tribes. Though they have not spoken, first impressions are already forming. <br/>I notice the older  gentleman looks like a mafia boss and he looks like he wants to boss people  around and I'm not the kind of character that likes his buttons pushed. <br/>There's an old  gray-haired guy that's pissing me off already. He seems like the kind of guy who's going to step into the leadership  position. I hope he does because he'll just get kicked off right away. <br/>Jeff: Forced to work  together, they must learn to adapt or they'll be voted out. <br/>I'm single. [ã    \laughsã    ] I am single, single, single. Very single. And flirting is something I'm going to use if I have to. <br/>Jeff: In the end,  only one will remain to claim the million-dollar prize. 39 days, 20 people, one Survivor! [ã    \theme song playingã    ] Jeff: Come on in,  guys. Welcome to "Survivor: Nicaragua." woman in the plaid, what's your  name? <br/>Eve. <br/>Jeff: You've had a  little bit of time to spend with these people. Can you tell things about people from the way they walk? From the way they're looking at each other? <br/>Yeah, absolutely. You can tell a lot about a person not just the way they're walking but by the  way they're watching other people. <br/>I was born with a  birth defect that forced the amputation of my right leg when I was six months  old. I think initially I'm keeping everything a secret. I don't want people to make assumptions about my physical ability and that's  what people do. <br/>Jeff: Guy in the  blue, what's your name? <br/>Marty. <br/>Jeff: Think you've  picked up anything based on eye contact? <br/>You can tell people  are "This is my team, this is who I'm going to be with." so people  are checking each other out. As I'm looking around the group right now, I see Jimmy Johnson, an n.F.L. Coach. I want nothing to do with Jimmy Johnson in this game. I have no idea why the hell he's even here. And I'd rather have him on the other tribe, frankly. <br/>Jeff: You guys ready  to get started? <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: All right, here  we go. Hidden somewhere down that lagoon is a medallion of power. The medallion of power could give you huge advantage in this game. The person who returns wearing the medallion of power claims it for their  tribe. This is not an individual reward. Make sense? <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: You can go any  time you want. <br/>Somebody's got to the  run to the right; somebody's got to run to the left. <br/>Jeff: People are  scattered everywhere looking for the medallion of power. <br/>Keep looking! Keep looking. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Very good! <br/>Jeff: Everybody head  on back. <br/>One of ours. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>What a way to start. I don't know your name but you did a great job! <br/>Jeff: Guys, come on  back in. <br/>I noticed there was a  girl with a limp. She has darker brown hair and I couldn't tell what was up with it. Like, I think that she, like, maybe has, like, a hip problem? But I don't know. I don't know what's going on with that. <br/>Jeff: Marty, what's  your take on Brenda having the medallion of power? <br/>I think it's a killer. It's important to win anything thrown at us and to be the tribe to win the  first thing, I think bodes really well for us. <br/>Jeff: It would be  great if it were that way. Unfortunately, Marty, this is not the way the tribes are going to be divided. We're now going to divide into tribes. If you are 40 and older you're over here. [laughter] Hey! Hey! <br/>Jeff: If you are 30  and younger, you're over here. <br/>Damn, man, I wanted  the old football coach, man! <br/>Oh, God! <br/>Jimmy johnson! <br/>Jeff: Divide it up! Let's go. <br/>Young guns! <br/>I'm young at heart! Oh, man! The older ones here, the younger ones there. I was looking forward to some of those young people carrying me. [ã    \laughsã    ] I don't want any of the old people with  me. <br/>When the switch came,  my first thought was oh, damn. The antiques have the best coach you could ask for. They've got a super bowl winning coach on their team. He's a great leader. That's what he's done his whole life. <br/>Jeff: Older tribe,  you are Espada. You're wearing blue. Younger tribe, you're called La Flor, you're wearing yellow. Put your buffs on. Make it official. <br/>Where do you put it? <br/>I think it can go on  your head. <br/>I'll have to mess up  my hair. It's going to be messed up for a while anyway. <br/>Jeff: Brenda, you won  the medallion of power for your tribe. You don't know how much power it has, all you know is that it is for your  tribe. But you're going to have to make a decision. You can hold on to this unknown power and get a chance to use it later in the  game or you can trade it right now for fire in the form of flint and a crate  full of fishing gear. You've got mask, fins, line, hooks and a spear to go along with it. So as a tribe here's what you're deciding. Do you keep power in the game or do you give it up for a quick start back at  camp? What you don't keep the other tribe gets. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay. <br/>I say we keep it  because the longer we stay in the more opportunities we're going to have. <br/>Keep it. <br/>The medallion threw  everything for a loop. I want to keep it. I like the fact that it's power. Power. <br/>I hope they keep it. <br/>I do, too. <br/>Fire and fish. Fire's going to be so important early. <br/>Decide, children. <br/>All right, let's...  Dude, we've got to fish. Do we want fire or fish, dude? <br/>Jeff: What's the  decision? Are you going to keep power or trade it for the fishing gear? <br/>Jeff: So here's what  you're deciding: Do you keep power in the game or are you going to trade it  for the fishing gear? <br/>We're going to take  the fishing gear. <br/>Jeff: All right, Brenda,  take it off and give it to somebody on the other tribe. Older tribe, you'll get a chance to play that medallion of power at some  point later in the game. <br/>We got power,  whatever it means. [laughter] We'll find out. <br/>And it's gold. Don't winners carry gold? <br/>Jeff: Espada, head  out that way, La Flor, head out that way. <br/>I figure the old  people need the medallion of power more than we do. I don't want to underestimate the old people but I don't think they'll be  able to handle some challenges. There's no reason why we should lose to them. <br/>Marty? Jimmy. <br/>Jimmy... Jimmy? <br/>Jimmy j.! Just call me jimmy. Oh, man! All the adventures I've had in the past, I was in charge. I can fire players, I could recruit players, I could sign them. Out here I don't have the control. So we've got to get the floor of the shelter. Maybe somebody's going to be infatuated with me being head coach Jimmy Johnson  superbowl winner. Well, I'll play on that. I'll play superstar status. Some of these other players may resent that. Maybe they're philadelphia eagle fans or washington red skin fans. <br/>That's Jimmy Johnson. <br/>That can't be. Jimmy johnson was the coach of the miami dolphins and dallas cowboys. <br/>That's him. <br/>So I've got to work  on each particular contestant to win them over because if I don't I'll be a  target and they'll vote me out early. <br/>I really like you. The first time I saw you I got a good feeling about that and I trust you. <br/>You know what? I agree. <br/>Okay. I'm with you all the way. <br/>Back in south dakota  coaching the swim team you have to deal with a lot of different personalities  and you still have to hold your composure at the same time. So I'm a very good Judge of people. The first time I saw Wendy I trusted her, and most of the time I do read  people very well. You got my word. <br/>Holly said she wanted  to be in an alliance with me and I thought that was awesome, but I wasn't  expecting it so soon. I don't know if I'm naive. My brother calls me sheltered and that's kind of like naive. I got three! This is my third! Being a goat rancher, you're with a lot of goats, you don't meet a lot of  people. My strategy from the beginning of the game is take baby steps first, not be  the first person voted off. My husband thinks I'm going to be the first person voted off because he  thinks I talk a lot. So I think I'm going to bite my tongue and hide my true self from the tribe  mates. <br/>Wendy jo, where are  you from? <br/>From montana. <br/>And you like horses? <br/>I do! <br/>She's a little weird. <br/>We got fire now. <br/>Huh? <br/>We'll have fire now. <br/>Okay. Oh, yeah, you got that. <br/>I can do it. Who's got the glasses? They think I'm some middle aged housewife that tootles around the house all  day long, they are in for a big surprise. Because that's definitely not me. I need to get it really concentrated right on that small spot. I'm 56 years old and I'm the type of person that stays busy all the time  doing things. I just don't think there's anything I can't do. Where there's smoke there will be fire. Winning the million dollars is real important to me because it will help me  pay off my farm, and the fact that I lost my husband in '09, it means I would  not have to work as hard as I do. But his spirit I know is still with me. And that's what keeps me going. <br/>There you go! There you go! Here you go! Fire! [ã    \cheers and applauseã    ] keep it going, guys. <br/>Jane, you rock! <br/>Is that friction or  glasses? <br/>Glasses, baby. <br/>Glasses, honey. <br/>Killer. They gave up the medallion and what did they get? Jane started the fire literally within half an hour. The fact that we made fire that quickly, it reassured us all that you know  what? We're going to take this thing. Espada rules! We've got just as much going for us as the young group does. [ã    \cheers and applauseã    ] High fives all around. Benry. <br/>Benry? <br/>Nice to meet you guys. This game that's old guys versus young guys, we know we're going to be able  to dominate. Great beach, great waves, beautiful girls. Doesn't get much better than that, right? <br/>Do we have a machete? <br/>We have one right  here. <br/>We can catch  rainwater and all kinds of stuff. As soon as we saw 30 and under it was like these are my people! This is going to be a lot of fun. <br/>You look like you'd  be good in the water. Or not. Ooh! Ow! [laughter] Damn, that was in  there! <br/>The guy with the long  blond hair, he's a dumb blond. I mean, I never really called a guy a dumb blond before but he's a dumb blond. <br/>Ow! Ow! Damn! Ow! <br/>Blond-head kid, the  one that looks like Fabio. Dude, he's just retarded. <br/>We've got to get more  bamboo. <br/>You're Fabio, you go  get it. <br/>All right. The name Fabio, man, I didn't even realize I was being called that at first. <br/>I'm going to go help Fabio. <br/>Do that, he needs it. Dude is an idiot, damn. <br/>Fabio, like, rides a  white horse and does butter commercials and is kind of a cheese ball. Whatever. Dude, I don't care what they call me. I'm gonna win the million dollars so I guess my nick name is Fabio. Timber! <br/>Okay, look, I feel  that me and you will be the strongest in challenges. Without me and you I think they're screwed. <br/>You and I are  definitely going to be the strongest as far as just strength wise. We may not be the best swimmers or something. <br/>I won't be the best  swimmer but strength wise any kind of athletic ability wise... That's a target on  our back. <br/>You're right because  they see alpha males being targeted. That's what's good about me and you sticking down to number two. Rob and russell could have ran it last year. I don't know about you but I don't want another girl to win it. <br/>Exactly. <br/>It's important we  don't let girls take over. We already get owned in marriage. Pretty soon we'll have a woman president. I mean, a guy needs to sack up and we need to win this one. <br/>So being an amputee,  every time I notice people looking down at the ground I thought they were  looking at my leg and my foot about what about my pants? I was paranoid that people were just staring at my leg. I was definitely thinking they were suspecting something was different. So I guess I'm going to have to just show it to everyone and so that's my  goal is to make sure that I come out with it and am able to prove immediately  that I am as physically capable as everyone else. <br/>I want to say  something to everyone. <br/>What's up? <br/>Can we group? <br/>Group meeting, guys. <br/>We got tree mail? <br/>No, no, I kind of  called the group meeting. We already have first impressions, gotten to know each other so I think at  this point I'm pretty comfortable with my team, right? <br/>Right. <br/>Wait, I'm confused. <br/>Well... Prosthetic. <br/>I knew it! <br/>I knew it, too. <br/>Oh! All right, now I am excited. [ã    \laughsã    ] What happened? <br/>I had a birth defect. <br/>You are a rock star. <br/>All right. Cool. <br/>I've always been  fascinated on how those things work. How do you tell it to move? [laughter] She does have a thigh. <br/>Being that I'm such a  wuss I could almost cry. If I went to the final three with her or two I'd be like just give her the  money. Just cut her the check because no money in the world can replace what she's  probably gone through in her life. But really she's going to be too big of a threat down the road. Sympathy vote no doubt. So I figure if we lose a challenge to the old folks, she's got to be one of  the first ones to go. <br/>So Kelly B. Has one leg and I don't want people getting mad at me because I talk about  her leg but it's a game. For the title of sole Survivor plus a million. So I'm not going to treat you as an outcast. If you feel like you can outrun me, girl, let's race. <br/>Guys, the fire, I  mean, seriously. <br/>That's just...  [ã    \applauseã    ] [ã     \retchingã    ] I overdid it, I  think, when we were getting all the wood and getting all the bamboo, and  everybody was so excited to get here and start working on stuff. I just... I think I did more than I needed to do. <br/>Coach needs to be  careful. He's getting his ass kicked out here now. I don't know if he's going for an academy award or if he's genuinely ill. But this is not for the weak and he's not a young man. <br/>Zero sleep, sick  throwing up, ants and mosquitos biting me everywhere, and cold and shivering  until the sun came up. I don't think I've ever had a 24-hour period where I was in that much  discomfort and that miserable. I've watched every second of "Survivor." I never imagined anywhere  close that it was this difficult. First time I've ever experienced anything like this and it's an eye opener, I  promise you. <br/>Did you know Jimmy Johnson? <br/>I didn't know him  before this but... Oh, my God. <br/>Did you know it was  him? <br/>Well, I used to cheer  for the dolphins so... I like your spirit. <br/>I like you, too. <br/>Okay, good. <br/>I absolutely... I  thought that from the beginning. Everything's just... You can make an alliance right now and then you get in a  challenge and end up hating that person. <br/>I don't think I'm  going to hate you. <br/>I'm not talking about  you and me, just in general. Brenda, she's a cute girl. I'm attracted to her. I for some reason really trust her. First thought you could come in and do... Guys want to get girls out or something. That's crazy. What if one of the guys is weak and you don't want him around? I don't want to have this thing where I have two different alliances. I'm not trying to come out here and lie to everybody but my dumb ass and put  my neck on the line early and I was not planning on doing that. But I made that alliance with Shannon and now I've got to figure out who I  can really trust. <br/>Sometimes you don't  have to say anything. <br/>I agree. <br/>We just know. I'm kind of use to having guys do what I say. What's funny is Chase came up and told me the guys have an alliance going on  and of course I'm going to use that information to get me to the end. I know Chase trusts me. He's a really nice guy but he's clueless. That looks like a well. Yay! All right. "This is a clue to a hidden immunity idol. It is up to you whether you share this information with anyone else. Decipher the clues to find the hidden immunity idol." What do you want to  do? <br/>Oh, gosh, well, we  keep it between us for sure. <br/>I think so. <br/>Especially this early. This is a map? [ã    \laughsã    ] I never realized how hard these are. We just found the clue to a hidden immunity idol. This early in the game. But we can't figure it out. <br/>So we're trying to  decipher what the clues mean. <br/>They're not easy. <br/>We're stumped. So we're thinking we're just going to hold on to it and maybe come back to it. <br/>Will you remember  where it is? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Kelly b. And I... It's kind of hard right now because we found the hidden immunity  idol clue together which I wish we didn't find it together so now I'm kind of  forced to be in an alliance with her and I don't want her to stick around for  a long time because... I mean, I don't want to go to the end with her  because, I mean, I don't want to say it but sympathy vote for sure and I'm  not trying to go up against that. <br/>Okay! [ã    \cheers and applauseã    ] Tree-mail! <br/>"Change the  course of waterfalls or you may just lose your claim. Keep your mind in the gutter or be the first to leave the game." so can  we give ourselves any advantage with that? <br/>This is a very  stressful time on these people. It's a very stressful time on me. We're the underdogs, the older folks and they need motivation. Everybody in this world needs motivation and I think I can help motivate this  team. Okay, folks, team huddle. First of all, the reason why I'm here is I'm here for the adventure, because  there's no way in the world a jury's going to give me a million bucks. I know that. But the thing that I can do, I can help somebody win a million bucks. And the winner can come from one of you guys. Nothing would make me happier than to see one of you win a million bucks. And I'll help you all the way. I promise you. Just as long as we're psyched up for it and we know what we've got to do,  we'll kick their ass. All right? <br/>All right! <br/>I just got a pep talk  from Jimmy Johnson! [ã    \cheers and applauseã    ] Jeff: Come on in,  guys! <br/>Whoo! Ha! Whoo! Ha! Whoo! Ha! Halt! La flor! <br/>Jeff: Okay. Older tribe. They came in sort of either serenading you or maybe that was a war cry. Jimmy? Any impact? <br/>I really don't  concentrate on what they do. We know what we have to do. <br/>Jeff: Jud, what do  you make of the older tribe? <br/>Jeff, his name is Fabio,  not Judson. His name is Fabio. He's the man. <br/>Jeff: Let's figure  out. Kelly, are you going to go by kelly in purple and blond hair? What are you going by? <br/>Purple kelly. <br/>Jeff: Purple Kelly. All right. Tyrone, when you see somebody on the other tribe like kelly with one  artificial leg, does that make you think "I've got to take it a little  easier on her"? <br/>Not at all. This is a competition, we're all operating big the same rules and we're going  to win. <br/>Jeff: All right. For today's immunity challenge one person will be at the top of a tower  pouring water while five other tribe members will use sections of gutter to  direct that water into a barrel. Once the barrel fills, a large bag of puzzle pieces will drop. The four remaining tribe members must then use those pieces to solve the  puzzle. First tribe to get it right wins immunity. [ã    \applauseã    ] if you have immunity in your  possession, you can not be sent home. The losers of this challenge will go to tribal council where the first person  will be voted out. All right. Now to the medallion of power. Older tribe, you guys have this medallion, you don't know what kind of power  it possesses. Here's how it works: The medallion of power gives you huge advantage at  challenges. If you use it today, you will start this challenge with one bucket of water  already in your barrel. Given that it takes about five buckets to fill, this is a significant  advantage. If you use it, then the medallion goes to the younger tribe and they will  have an opportunity to use it at the next challenge. I'm going to give you a minute to strategize. <br/>I don't think that's  enough. <br/>This type of a  challenge we can compete with them no problem. <br/>Let's make a statement. Let's make a statement and hold on to it. <br/>So we're keeping it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: Older tribe,  what's it going to be? You going to use it or not? <br/>We're going to keep  it. <br/>Jeff: All right. Older tribe opting to keep the medallion of power. Give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. Okay. It is the first immunity challenge in "Survivor: Nicaragua," old  versus young. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Set it up! Set it up! Set it up! <br/>Jeff: The task is  very simple: One person pours water down the gutters into the barrel. Once your barrel is full, the puzzles will drop. <br/>Go, baby! Go! <br/>Don't spill it! <br/>Very close! Very close. <br/>You're doing great,  guys, keep it steady! <br/>Fast! Fast! <br/>Jeff: Younger tribe  has a nice flow. <br/>Slow and steady! Don't waste it! <br/>Just like that. Little slower. <br/>I got it. <br/>Slow and steady,  everything you can get. <br/>That's good. A steady flow. <br/>Jeff: Older tribe  with a great flow. <br/>Come on, guys! Keep it going! Keep it going! Whoo! <br/>Come on, Holly! <br/>Keep it going! <br/>Keep it going, keep  it going! <br/>Jeff: Younger tribe  releases their puzzle pieces. <br/>Let's go, girls, keep  it going! Don't panic! <br/>Go, go! <br/>Jeff: Older tribe  released their puzzle pieces. <br/>Let's go! <br/>You got it ladies! Let's go. <br/>Jeff: Both tribes  working on their puzzle. We are very even in this first challenge. It's going to come down to four older women, four younger women. Will it be wisdom or enthusiasm that will win this challenge? <br/>Look at the buff, guys! <br/>Jeff: Young tribe off  to a quick start. <br/>Look at the buff! <br/>Jeff: Older tribe now  getting something going. Older tribe, you need to pick it up! <br/>Come on! <br/>Almost there! <br/>Jeff: Younger tribe  getting very close! What's not right? Something's not working. <br/>Leave that! <br/>Jeff: Older tribe now  back in it. Immunity on the line. Somebody going home tonight! <br/>Fit it in! <br/>Jeff: Younger tribe  wins immunity! [ã    \cheers and applauseã    ] younger tribe, congratulations. [ã    \applauseã    ] nobody going home from the younger  tribe. Brenda, would you have used that medallion of power? <br/>Yes, definitely. Because you're here to win, so why take chances when you're here doing it  right now? Why are you thinking about tomorrow or the next day when you're playing right  now? <br/>Jeff: All right. Older tribe, I'll see you tonight at tribal where somebody will be the first  person voted out of this game. Grab your stuff and head on back to camp. <br/>I remember my second  superbowl we lost the first two ball games. But we were able to keep going and we hung in there and, of course, won the  super bowl. Losing the first challenge, it's not the end of the world. Just make sure we make a smart decision, get rid of the weakest player and  still have the medallion, still have a strong team. <br/>Let's see what's  going on. I don't know, I can't even think clearly right now. I'm junked from the trauma of the challenge. I need to sleep. I want to lay down. I'm 48 years old, but this place already knocked me down, it's only day three. So I've got to learn to deal with that and I've got to figure out how to play  the game. <br/>Jimmy t., what are  you thinking? <br/>I think jimmy's  trying to horn swaggle everybody, telling everybody I really care about you,  I want to make you a million dollars. So anyway, I'm voting Jimmy Tonight. I'm just... What do you think? <br/>I've got to say this. I'm not going to not be heard here. <br/>Okay. <br/>I'm not going to not  be heard. <br/>Okay, all right, I'm  listening, I'm listening. <br/>All right. I know... I know that sometimes stars blind people. <br/>Okay. I'm totally with you. <br/>I've got to call him  down. <br/>Nobody wants to be  the first one to go home. <br/>Whoever it is, you  know, we all got to decide to take out the weakest player. And that makes the team stronger. <br/>So who do you think  is the weakest player? <br/>I think it's either  myself or Wendy. Personally I think it's Wendy. I mean, how is this team going to get stronger? Forget about personalities. Forget about alliances. <br/>You really mean that? <br/>I really do. I mean it. <br/>Coach explained that  we need to keep our team stronger and I agree with him. And that's something I should have thought about before I rushed into the  alliance with Wendy. <br/>This game we just  don't know. <br/>I mean, but you ask  yourself, does the team get stronger without Wendy? <br/>I'm really caught in  a dilemma because I shook her hand and gave her my word. So I really don't know. I'm just going to see what happens. <br/>Here's the question,  though... And the pot's not  going to set well. <br/>I look nervous and  concerned probably because I am nervous and concerned. Well, I don't know if I'm nervous but I'm concerned because I think I'm on  the outs because I don't think I developed a bond with a lot of the people. <br/>You going to come out? <br/>No, I'm going to go  back up. <br/>All right. You shouldn't trust anyone in "Survivor" that's true. Holly won't even talk to me and she told me... We shook on an alliance the  first day. So I'm thinking heck, what's going on is all I want to know. <br/>Here's what jimmy said  to me. He said at this point in the ball game we should focus on strength and  alliances are broken all the time. He said there's two weak players. <br/>Did he include  himself in that? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay. <br/>The other? <br/>Wendy. <br/>So who do you think  keeps this is tribe strong? <br/>I'm not... I don't  know. What do you... I don't know at this point what to think. <br/>I don't think either  one of them is a bad choice. <br/>Um... Why don't we go  around the circle and honestly say who you would rather. Does that sound fair? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Sounds good. <br/>Sounds good to me. <br/>Sounds good. <br/>What do you think? <br/>This is what I think. I'm of the opinion that we need to keep the tribe strong... This is the first  time that we've had to really feel each other out for something as important  as who's going to go home and you try to coax it out of people, you're  getting tentativeness, nervousness about anybody saying a name. <br/>So what do we say? I don't know? <br/>Um... It could be a real  toss between Wendy jo and Jimmy Johnson. We don't know how either one could really perform in a physical challenge. We're making some hunches here. We're making some guesses and Wendy jo probably doesn't add a lot on the  physicality side of the challenges. And I think just because you're Jimmy Johnson and you're telling me the  jury's not going to give you the million dollars, I'm not buying it. It will be interesting. We will have to see just how this thing plays out. <br/>Jeff: Behind each of  you is a torch. Go ahead and grab the torch and approach the flame. Dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual at tribal council because in this game fire  represents your life. As long as you have fire, you're still in the game. When your fire's gone, so are you. Well, welcome to tribal council. So let's talk about first impressions. Jane, what is typically the first impression people have when they meet you? <br/>They might call me a  southern hillbilly. <br/>I call her  "Survivor" mcguYver because within an hour of hitting the beach Jane  had the fire going. She can do anything here. <br/>Jeff: Jane, did you  know you could do it? <br/>Hell, yeah, I knew I  could do it. Because I saw an article that you wrote and it said "Why would anybody  come and play 'Survivor' that didn't know how to make a fire?" Jeff: You listened to  something I said? <br/>I took it to heart,  too, because I practiced for two months. <br/>Jeff: Jimmy T., how  big were those first few moments for you in making first impressions? <br/>Unbelievable. Where I do come from I'm a leader. When I talk, people listen. When you get to "Survivor", there's people that are stronger,  there's people with more integrity and when you have one of the greatest  leaders in the n.F.L. Of all time, it's very frustrating. I'm just another player here. <br/>Jeff: Jimmy, when you  hear something like that, do you feel a little target on your back that  people will either look to you for leadership or be annoyed that you are a  leader? <br/>Let me make it clear,  I'm not the boss. But, yeah, I'm going to be a target every single tribal council. I know that. But I'm not a threat to anybody here for the simple reason no jury's going to  award me a million bucks. I know that. I'm not here for the money, I'm here for the adventure. But I'll only be here as long as I can help this team be successful. <br/>Jeff: Jimmy T, can  you buy that? <br/>No way, he's going to  try to win this thing. And I think he can win the game because if he leads so well and deserves to  win the game, the jury's going to let him win that game. <br/>Jeff: Marty, Jimmy T. Brings up an interesting point. Most people on "Survivor" are born leaders. Is that a shock for you to get used to as well? <br/>I think coming into  it you have to be careful about being over-the-top leader because typically  that puts a target on your back right away. So I think there's different ways to lead and it's making sure you don't lead  in the way that gets you into trouble. <br/>Jeff: Let's talk  about tonight's vote. Who here by a show of hands truly thinks they're in trouble? More than half the tribe. Holly, why are you concerned it might be you tonight? <br/>I made an alliance  right into the game and coach came over to me after the challenge and he  feels like there's two weak links. Well, I don't know if I necessarily agree with who he decides. So definitely. <br/>Jeff: Wendy, why do  you think the tribe would want to vote you out tonight? <br/>I don't feel like I  connected very well with the people here. I was very busy but some people talked at the camp and I didn't feel like I  got a lot of that. Because they would be quite surprised if someone asked me some questions. There's nobody here that even knows my age. Not one person asked me. <br/>I asked you. <br/>No, you didn't. <br/>That's one question I  never ask anyone. <br/>No, you never asked  me! <br/>You're not supposed  to ask a woman her age. <br/>How old are you? <br/>48. <br/>You look so young. <br/>Jeff: Wendy,  typically the one question you wouldn't ask a woman is "How old are  you." so it's interesting that that's the question that has you tweaked. <br/>Oh, it doesn't have  me tweaked, I just found it interesting that nobody asked me. Maybe I'll start tooting my horn. [ã    \laughsã    ] maybe that's what I should do. Maybe I should have been talkative and share everything. But I didn't want to come in talk, talk, talk, and drive people crazy because  people don't like people who talk all the time. So I stayed pretty quiet and that is not me. I have a nickname of chatter box. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time to vote. Jane, you're up. <br/>Can I say one thing? <br/>Jeff: Wendy, you had  something else you wanted to say? <br/>I would also like to  tell the group I think there's a lot that I can bring through my strength, my  leadership. I could be very friendly, very honest, very funny, fun to be with, strong  willed, strong physically. People like to be my friend. People like to be with me. They trust me all the time. Trust is important. And I don't have any blisters on my feet and that's an asset. That will help, just a little thing I'd point out. I think that's about it. <br/>Jeff: I just want to  make sure you get everything off your chest. <br/>That's it. <br/>Jeff: All right. Let's get to the vote. Jane, you're up. <br/>Initially the  decision was tough but after hearing you speak tonight with your excuses, it  became easy. Wendy jo, you gotta go. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally  the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Wendy. Eve. That's one vote eve, one vote Wendy. Wendy. Two votes Wendy. Wendy. That's three votes Wendy. Wendy, that's four votes Wendy. Wendy, that's five votes Wendy, one vote eve. First person voted out of "Survivor: Nicaragua," Wendy. That's six, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Jeff: Wendy, the  tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Jeff: Well, tonight's  vote was clearly designed to improve the chemistry of this tribe. One good thing about coming to tribal council, you will leave here with fire. Here's your flint. Grab a torch, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Next time on  "Survivor." Fatigue makes the  minds get weak. <br/>New york city boy Danny,  let's just fill his shoes up and then... Why you raising your  voice at me? I can get loud, too. I don't like anything about him. He gets on my nerves. <br/>Jeff: 21 seasons of  "Survivor," never had an opening question open that much whoop ass. <br/>I don't think it's  fair. And what I find interesting is this is probably the only time in my life I  was a loser with strangers. I changed coming into the game. If I would have been myself it would have worked out better. I wish I could go back. Maybe they'll stick me on the young people's tribe.
