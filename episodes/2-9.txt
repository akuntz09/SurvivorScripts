<br/>Jeff: 24 days ago, 16 survivors were abandoned in the  Australian outback. The eight remaining members of the Barramundi tribe have now  made it past the halfway point. Tonight, in a special episode of highlights and never before  seen footage, we'll take a closer look at their adventure thus far. <br/>Kel: I'm a captain in the U.S. Army, and for them to question my integrity over a piece of beef  jerky means a lot to me. <br/>Rodger: Maybe I've been playing the Kentucky Joe part a  little bit too much, and maybe I need to come out a little bit more. <br/>Jeff: Day One found 16 need to come out a little bit more. <br/>Jeff: Day One found 16 strangers abandoned in one of the  most unforgiving places anywhere on Earth-- the Australian outback. As two separate tribes, Kucha and Ogakor, they gathered whatever  supplies they could carry, and began a five-mile hike to find their camps. It didn't take long for certain personalities to clash. <br/>Debb: Nick, stay in the front, Nick, and keep us going  north to northeast, okay? <br/>Nick: Even from the beginning, people were automatically  getting on people's nerves. We were walking through the grass, and Kimmi was like I can't  stand Debb. <br/>Kimmi: Debb is not even a bad person. She means well. It's just she's not somebody in the outside world I would talk  to, because she'd make me crazy. <br/>Debb: See, if we're going southwest, how are we going to  get the dry quickbed? <br/>Elisabeth: Because that's north! <br/>Debb: That's right. <br/>Colby: You all right, Maralyn? That trek let me know that this was for real. That was a long trek we had through deep sand, and that fired me  up, because that is the quickest way to find out what people are made of. <br/>Amber: This rice is very heavy. I really want to get there soon. [ whooping and cheering]  Jeff: Once the tribes had found the flags and canoes that  marked their beaches, the mood was upbeat. [ whooping] But with night approaching, Kucha and Ogakor turned  to the serious task of assessing their living conditions. <br/>Debb: We got enough rocks here, too. We could build a pretty decent shelter just using rocks. <br/>Mitchell: Colby, his luxury item was the Texan flag, which  is great, because it covers us and blocks us from the wind and the sun. <br/>Colby: Don't get me wrong. When I wake up in the morning, there's two things I'm thankful  for. I'm thankful I'm alive, and I'm thankful I'm a Texan. <br/>Jeff: Keith and Jerri got off to a shaky start. <br/>Jerri: No, but it's not going to stay. But see, we put it on the grommet for a reason, so that the flag  wouldn't rip. <br/>Keith: You can't. You won't be able to go through that on a flat surface. <br/>Jerri: Tension between Keith and I... I think him and I  kind of rubbed each other the wrong way. <br/>Jeff: On the first night at Ogakor, sleep was hard to come  by thanks to Colby. [ loud snoring] [ snoring continues]  Maralyn: God, has anybody gotten any quality of sleep? <br/>Keith: Colby. We had added a new sound to the outback. Maralyn: Oh, Jesus. <br/>Keith: All these critters are going what the hell is that  animal!? [ soft laughter]  Colby: I snored? <br/>Trust me, you were snoring. <br/>It's like you had sucked sand into your nose. <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Colby: It doesn't bother me much, but... might explain why  I don't have a girlfriend, I don't know. [ women groaning sympathetically ]  Jerri: I hate to say it, but you're probably right. [ laughter]  Mitchell: I'm a little annoyed because I'm waiting for  Kelly to pull his stuff together, 'cause we're going to go fishing, but it  should be a good trip 'cause he might tell me some things that might be  useful to any strategies that we may have planned. I mean, he's a nice enough guy, but if there is one person to  vote off right now, it definitely would be him. <br/>Kel: See, there's like a rope hanging from that limb over  there? <br/>Mitchell: All right, now I see it. I wonder what the other team is planning. <br/>Kel: You think they'd be talking about that that early in  the game? <br/>Mitchell: I don't know. <br/>Kel: So, we have nothing in here? <br/>Mitchell: Do you see anybody as the weakest yet? <br/>Kel: Everybody has some very strong strengths. I mean, have you thought about that? I mean, obviously you have, to ask it. <br/>Mitchell: Well, I think we all have; it's kind of  inevitable. In a few days, we're going to have to... right? <br/>Kel: You don't ever learn anything by talking. You learn things by listening. Right now I'm listening to them, I'm learning about them. Tell me who you think is the weakest, then. <br/>Mitchell: I don't know. Maralyn is probably the weakest. Part of me thinks to maybe even go for the most threatening too,  you know? I'm trying to decide which way to go. <br/>Kel: I think Jerri and Mitch would look at me as someone  they would vote off because I would be potentially dangerous to them because  I'm mentally and physically strong. We're good. We can head back. <br/>Jeff: Voting strategy wasn't the only thing on the survivors'  minds. Fire quickly became a priority for both tribes. <br/>Kimmi: I'm angry! Angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry, angry! We're generating some sparks. We tried every way to get this fire going. Yes, I was smashing the rock, but I made it into an energy  release, because you just can't say to people you're a jerk-off, shut up, so  you focus your energy somewhere else, and you're fine. <br/>Amber: Fire. [ loud, abrasive squeaking]  Whoo! [ high-pitched whooping]  Jeff: Despite their efforts, neither tribe succeeded in  generating more than a few sparks and a little smoke. <br/>Maralyn: Until we can get a fire and boil water, we're not  going to be eating much of anything. <br/>Jeff: But luck was about to change for one tribe. The first challenge brought the hope of fire and immunity. Waterproof matches. One of the things we're playing for tonight, right here. We're also playing for something else-- the immunity idol. It was Ogakor who had the first taste of victory. Your reward-- waterproof matches. [ cheering] And that night, they had their first taste of hot  food as well. <br/>One vegetable paella coming up. <br/>Jeff: But professional chef Keith didn't quite live up to  his credentials. <br/>Amber: I was pretty surprised the first time I tasted the  rice. I was really looking forward to a warm meal. And the first bite was nothing like I imagined. I'm not complaining, I promise, but... It's hard to eat. <br/>Jerri: The first time Keith made rice, the rice was way  undercooked. I hate to say it, but it wasn't really very good. <br/>Colby: I don't think the first batch of rice went over  real well. In fact, I think it went over like a pickle in a punchbowl. <br/>Keith: Anyone want seconds? <br/>Jeff: On Day Three, the torches were lit for the first  Tribal Council. For Kucha, there was little question about who should be the  first person voted out of the tribe. <br/>Alicia: She's very set in her ways, she doesn't like to be  second guessed, and it makes it very hard for us to deal with her in any kind  of group dynamic. <br/>Nick: At this point, I think that Rodger would probably be  the smarter vote, but I think that the group dynamics and people fitting in  well together is important, and Debb is definitely on the outside with  certain people. <br/>Kimmi: She just chooses to be independent, and she's just  a strong-willed person. It's not a bad thing, it's just not what I need. <br/>Jeff: First person voted out of the tribe... is Debb. The tribe has spoken. <br/>JEFF K: It's a reward. "A leap of faith is not for the skilled, Just step off the  edge, try not to get killed."  Jeff: With Day Four came the first reward challenge-- one  that gave Rodger something to worry about. <br/>Rodger: Today's challenge is probably going to be jumping  off a cliff into some water. I just basically learned to swim right before we came out here,  plus I just never did like heights. [ whooping] [ yelling]  Come on, Rodger! <br/>Jeff: Though Rodger gave his all, it wasn't enough to  secure a Kucha victory. Ogakor crossed the finish line first, and walked away with two  warm blankets as their reward. <br/>Rodger: For five quarts of beans, I'd have jumped off of  there again. I think. Well, after we came back from the award challenge, it's right  down the river here a ways, there's a rapids running through there. <br/>Nick: Hey, guys, everybody in the hot tub! âª  Alicia: They have a rock bed with all this water, just  like cascading sounds, like a little waterfall. Like little white rapids. We all ran and got in. It's just like a Jacuzzi, and it's become Kucha Jacuzzi. <br/>Elisabeth: It just felt so good on our muscles, and I  think for the first time, all the workaholics in our group took like, ten  minutes to just think about the fact that we jumped off a cliff! <br/>Alicia: Rodger! Rodger, come on, we got a Jacuzzi going over here! <br/>Rodger: Oh, man, that's... Whoo, that's cold! But it feels good. <br/>I think that our morale was more positive to see that  Kentucky Joe was able to take the swan dive off the cliff and be like, you  know what, I might not be the best at it, but you know what, I'm not going to  let my team down, and that is just like a greater triumph than two blankets. <br/>Rodger: I'm losing my trunks here! I'm losing my trunks! <br/>Jeff V.: Who would have thought Rodger would be the first  for this? <br/>Michael: It's a fine line between the physical weak link  and one of the strongest morale builders. We all kind of gather around him for that father-figure type of  thing, so I'm just trying to decide how important that's going to be to my  ultimate survivor. <br/>Rodger: Whoo! I could sleep right here tonight. <br/>Alicia: I know. <br/>Rodger: As far as what they've been calling me-- Kentucky  Joe-- yes, I've been kind of playing along with that. I'm kind of playing the old dumb farm boy, schoolteacher, dirt  poor, and maybe I've been playing the Kentucky Joe part a little bit too  much. And maybe I need to come out a little bit more. I didn't want the others to have the impression that I'm ready  to leave, 'cause I am not. I'm here for the duration if that works out. âª  Jeff: On Day Five, a storm brewed at Ogakor in the form of  a blue bikini. First Jerri muscled in on Keith's cooking duties. <br/>Jerri: There's a bunch more things we can have than rice,  and I'm ready to start making some of them. <br/>Keith: She wants to cook some tortillas for breakfast, I  think it's fantastic. Actually, it's a break for me. No worries, mate. <br/>Jeff: Then she accused Kel of smuggling beef jerky. <br/>Jerri: And I saw him put something in his mouth, and it  was a dark brown color. <br/>Mitchell: I believe her, actually. <br/>Jerri: To think that someone in our own tribe would be  sneaking in extra stuff, especially food. <br/>Maralyn: While Kel was up on the hill, they rifled through  his bag. <br/>Tina: There wasn't anything in there at all, but all I was  thinking about, if I find beef jerky in here, it's going to be ugly. <br/>Kel: How you guys doing? You guys were talking about that you thought I was eating beef  jerky. It was a blade of grass. I smushed it up into my jaw, and I was chewing on that. I was just chewing grass. <br/>Maralyn: Nobody had any right to go into Kel's bag. It would be very big of us to apologize. <br/>Jerri: No. <br/>Maralyn: Gee whiz, things are heating up at our  encampment. Oh, my butt! <br/>Kel: I only learned that they went through my stuff after  Keith told me. We took a boat ride, and he said hey, you know what? Those guys went through your stuff to check to see if they could  find this magical beef jerky. And it's not there in my stuff. I mean, it's not there because I didn't bring it. If somebody has something to say about me, they should have had  the guts, you know, to be able to come face to face with me and say, what's  that in your mouth, you know? Our bags had been checked before we got out here. I mean, there's no way I could have had beef jerky after I was  swimming in the water or in my gear or anything, or have it out here. <br/>Keith: Any type of relationship, you have... stress  points. I've already had mine with Jerri. These individuals here aren't trying to cohabitate for life. They're trying to cohabitate for a million dollars. <br/>Kel: I don't disagree with you on the fact that I want to  win every day. I want to win all the competitions. I have no problem with that. But you have to understand that... you know, I'm a captain in  the U.S. Army, and for them to question my integrity over a piece of beef  jerky... Can I finish, please? <br/>Keith: Sure. <br/>Kel: Over a piece of beef jerky, means a lot to me. As you've noticed in the last few days, I'm a good person, and  I'm also very simple. You know, I don't do a lot of talking. I'm not the life of the party. Maybe it bothers you guys that I'm not as talkative as you guys  are, and maybe that rubs you guys the wrong way. <br/>Maralyn: Kel, they got caught up in this beef jerky  frenzy, and nobody had any, nobody had any right to go through your bag. Your attitude about all of that was, uh, incredibly controlled, because  if it had been me, hey, I probably would have torn the whole camp down! Somebody went through my bag? Hello! Everybody on this whole team considers you a valuable part of  the team. <br/>Keith: Oh, that is very true. <br/>Maralyn: And we just don't want this to rub you the wrong  way. <br/>Kel: Well, look, it doesn't rub me the wrong way, because  I don't get upset very easily, and I can't remember the last time I ever  gotten angry. I mean, I just don't get angry, and I found this more comical  than anything. I was going, who are these people? Why are they, where do they come from that they just think that  this captain is going to jeopardize his career over a piece of beef jerky? Either they don't like me, which is quite possible, or they want  to sabotage my character as a way of making me someone that's not desirable  for an alliance. And that's too bad if they're playing the game that way, 'cause  I'm not going to play the game that way. I'm not going to play it dirty, and I'm not going to bring this  issue up to them because it's just going to develop more confrontation. It does bother me, but the main aspect right now is to develop a  solid team. <br/>Nick: "The next challenge may go too far, Just say  rub-a-dub-dub, thank God for the grub, Close your eyes, plug your nose, and  swallow hard." We're eating. <br/>Alicia: We're eating bugs! <br/>Nick: We're eating something. <br/>Jeff: On Day Six, Kimmi felt the pressure of the second  immunity challenge. <br/>Kimmi: Let me go last. I'm a vegetarian, which means I don't eat land-dwelling animals. I'm not eating amphibian, I'm not eating reptile, I'm not eating  mammal, I'm not eating fat. <br/>Jeff: But in a tie-breaker, she pulled through by  swallowing a mangrove worm, securing Kucha's first immunity victory. [ cheering] At Ogakor's first Tribal Council, Kel couldn't  overcome the stigma of being the loner, an accused beef jerky smuggler. The army captain was deserted by his tribe. <br/>Jerri: He made it too easy to cast this vote too early in  the game. <br/>Mitchell: The only comfort I have in voting this way is  the fact that you brought this on all by yourself. <br/>Tina: I know you're probably a good military person, but  you're the person who least likely tried to fit into our tribe. <br/>Maralyn: If you were lying in the Simpson Desert, dying of  thirst, every single one of us would give you a drink of water. <br/>Colby: Thanks for playing. We have some nice parting gifts for you. <br/>Jeff: The tribe has spoken. <br/>Jeff: The tribe has spoken. <br/>Jeff: By Day Seven, Mike was becoming more restless about  the food situation. <br/>Michael: I think people are still recovering from the  coldness of the night. But I kind of wish everybody would take advantage of the early  morning fishing, 'cause I think we could get a lot of fish. We were going to have seven poles in the water this morning. Maybe they're just relying on me to bring in the fish. I do know that bringing home food does secure me longevity in  the tribe, which is an equal incentive to go out and get fish as my yearning  for food. incentive to go out and get fish as my yearning for food. <br/>Jeff: By Day Eight, Maralyn was feeling secure with at  least one of her friendships. <br/>Maralyn: Tina is a fabulous woman. She is a star. I trust Tina the most. <br/>Tina: Maralyn and I have bonded more so than I have with  any of the other people. It might be our ages. <br/>Jeff: But at the immunity challenge, it was Maralyn  stumbling that robbed Ogakor of a victory...  Kucha! <br/>Jeff: ...sending them back to Tribal Council, where  Maralyn again asserted her bond with Tina. <br/>Maralyn: I'm conjoined with Tina. <br/>Jeff: But she learned the hard way that at least in this  game, friendships aren't always worth a million dollars. <br/>Tina: Mad Dog, I love you. I value your friendship more than anything. This vote has everything to do with the promise I made, has  nothing to do with you. I hope you'll understand. <br/>Mitchell: It kills me to do this to you. It was difficult to watch you get all scraped up in those  challenges. <br/>Jerri: Fireside concerts will not be the same without you. <br/>Colby: The last nine days have really taken their toll on  you, both physically and emotionally. <br/>Jeff: The tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. [ indistinct chatter]  Jeff: On day ten, Mike continued to obsess over fish. Every last bit of them. <br/>Michael: Livers and kidneys, these are hearts. And these are... I'm not sure what those purple things are. Those are probably the pancreas or something. I don't know. And this is... I don't know what this stuff is, but it was just  in one of them. I scaled these puppies, too. We're having fish skins today. These are the fish eggs. I ate the stomach, and I ate the heart, the liver, and, uh, I  think the pancreas. And...  Jeff V.: He's crazy. <br/>At least he's cooking it now. <br/>Michael: Um, these are just the leftover... The  leftover... [ laughs] At least I'm cooking it now. <br/>He used to eat it raw. <br/>Michael: And we had eyeballs last night. Or two nights ago. <br/>Nick: Mike eats fish guts, but Mike eats things that just  aren't necessary. Why eat a fish eyeball? It has zero nutritional value as far as I know. <br/>Michael: The only part of the fish that we haven't eaten  at this point is the actual outer core of the head, the skull. <br/>Kimmi: Let me just clear that up. Mike eats just about everything. Mike ate the eyeballs, Mike ate the pancreas, the liver, the  kidney, the intestine, the stomach. <br/>I don't care. <br/>I like the intestines, but...  Kimmi: Not all of us are eating that. He's the only one that ate eyeballs. <br/>Jeff: And when Mike went out to catch more fish, Jeff got  annoyed. <br/>Jeff V.: Mike bumped me out of the boat to go fishing. It wasn't right, and I wanted to go off on him right then and  there. But then I thought, no. How can I use this situation to my advantage in garnishing  respect from the tribe? Which is exactly what I did. <br/>Kimmi: Jeff? I'll take you fishing later. <br/>Jeff V.: It's okay. <br/>Kimmi: So, you didn't say anything? <br/>Jeff V.: No. I don't care. <br/>Kimmi: All right. <br/>Jeff V.: They can catch fish, they can catch them. <br/>Alicia: Everybody should get a turn. This is not, first person awake gets in the boat. Wake somebody up and say, "I'm going fishing. Did you want to come?" That's so easy to do. If Jeff said no, then it's on him. But, no, right away the decision is made, Mike is up, he's  going. And they just got in the boat and left. That cannot happen. It just can't happen. <br/>Nick: Say something to him then. <br/>Alicia: This is... This is a group, people. <br/>Nick: Then say something to him. <br/>Alicia: I will say something. <br/>Nick: Just let it be? <br/>Alicia: 'Cause things have to be fair, you know? It can't be like that. <br/>Jeff V.: Alicia was, like, "Well, fine. If he wants to do it that way, we're voting him out." There  it is on a silver platter. Conflict. I'm in the middle of it, but it doesn't look like I'm in the  middle of it. That's the way I hope things sort of play out. [ animals chittering] âª  Jeff: On day ten, Kucha was âª  Jeff: On day ten, Kucha was back in action. They won three chickens and a rooster at the reward challenge...  [ indistinct chatter]  ALL: Yay! <br/>Jeff: ...much to Kimmi's dismay. <br/>Kimmi: Wait, don't break her wings off. <br/>Rodger: She ain't gonna... Who's next? <br/>Kimmi: Can't they give us some edamame, some tofu? [ Nick laughs]  Jeff: And just when Kucha seemed to have it all, Michael  made good on his promise to bring in more food. On day 11 he killed a wild pig. [ pig squeals]  Jeff V: Mike killed a pig, and there's going to be a lot  of ham, bacon and pork coming up in here. <br/>Kimmi: What is wrong with you people? This is sick. I live in a sick tribe. <br/>Alicia: It's good, right? <br/>Jeff V.: Mmm. <br/>Elisabeth: Whoa. We're going to get strong now. <br/>Jeff: That night at Ogakor there was no banquet, just more  rice. <br/>Mitchell: Damn, that was good. <br/>...That's not gonna happen. <br/>Tina: Should we play our game now before everybody gets  sleepy? <br/>Jeff: With morale low, they decided to try something new. <br/>Mitchell: After supper, Tina-- she started the idea that  since we were all feeling down, since we were all having a negative attitude  toward each other that we should, uh, go around and say good things about  each other, say positive things. <br/>Keith: Jerri. Jerri, Jerri, Jerri, Jerri. Well, we've had our differences. And we probably always will. And but from get-go, it was rough, it was rough. And, uh, rightfully so. I mean, we're thrown into something to play a game. But in a different place and a different time, it would be much  different. <br/>Jerri: Thanks, Keith. <br/>Tina: Very honest, Keith. <br/>Jerri: We still have Keith to go here. All right? <br/>Colby: Yup, that's right. <br/>Jerri: I'm going to go first. It's-It's hard, because I can be a little bit of a control  freak. And I know that. But, I'm... I mean, I... If I in any way have... hurt your  feelings or... any of that, I'm truly sorry. I don't have a problem saying I'm sorry. That was something I just felt I wanted to do. 'Cause if I... I didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings, I  didn't want to step on anybody's toes, and I felt such a great sense of  relief after that. Well, I-I definitely feel better, expressing this, 'cause holding  it in just sucks. It really does. <br/>Keith: Her apologizing to me was just enormous, and, uh,  we were able to wipe the slate clean. <br/>Jerri: I'm very glad that I've gotten to know you, Keith,  and I... You know what? Some day, I-I really want to taste your cooking. <br/>Keith: Man, you know it, and you're going to. If I got to shove it down your throat...  Jerri: No, you don't have to. <br/>Keith: ...piece by piece, I'm going to feed it to you. [ laughter]  Tina: Jerri, I'm real impressed with you saying, you know,  saying that you were sorry. Sorry is a very hard word to say. Jerri was on my last nerve, and just her expressing to the  tribe, I know I have these controlling issues, made all the difference in the  world to me. <br/>Well, don't we all feel better after this? <br/>ALL: Yeah. <br/>I do. <br/>Amber: I like this game. [ laughter]  Jeff: On day 12, Kucha continued their hot streak by  winning another immunity challenge. C is right! Kucha wins... [ cheering] So Ogakor went back to Tribal Council  for the third consecutive time. And though there was a plan to oust Keith, it was Mitchell who  was taken by surprise when some members changed their strategy at the last  minute. <br/>Colby: Man, you know this is nothing personal. But I'm here to win. <br/>Tina: Let the games begin. <br/>Keith: And when I get to New York, I'm buying the  champagne for dinner, buddy. <br/>Mitchell: You add some tension to the group at times, and  my hope is that by eliminating you, we eliminate a little bit of that  friction. <br/>Jerri: Two days ago this would have been much easier than  it is right now. I'm very glad we buried the hatchet. <br/>Jeff: Two rounds of voting resulted in a tie between Keith  and Mitchell. In the Survivorrules, in a deadlock, you go to votes cast in  previous Tribal Councils. Tribe member with the most votes is the person voted out. How many votes have you had cast against you Keith? <br/>Keith: None. <br/>Jeff: Mitchell? <br/>Mitchell: One. <br/>Jeff: One vote is the difference. The tribe has spoken. Having lost three members in a row, Ogakor was in a downward  spiral. [ thunder rumbling] Things didn't get any better on day 13. Friction developed between Colby and Jerri when they had to  build a stretcher for the reward challenge. <br/>Colby: I think it's great. I'm saying instead of starting it over the top, start it  underneath. <br/>From underneath. <br/>Colby: See what I'm saying? <br/>I've got two pieces. <br/>Jerri: No, I don't see what you're saying. God... bless America. This...  Jerri: Does Colby seem like he's in kind of a bad mood? <br/>Amber: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. <br/>Jerri: Oh, my God. <br/>Amber: I don't know if one of us said something, I mean, I  said something. I don't know. <br/>Jerri: Dudes are weird. [ laughs]  Amber: I mean, he did seem pretty stressed. Maybe he's just, like, "You know, I just want to be by  myself for a little bit."  Jerri: There's... We have no reason to be stressed. We built a... awesome stretcher. And I want to help make him feel better if I can. This whole thing is stressful enough without adding more stress. [ indistinct chatter]  Jeff: For the fourth time in a row, Kucha came through  with another victory. [ cheering] And Ogakor reached a new low. <br/>Amber: I'm so tired of losing. <br/>Don't let 'em break your spirit...  Jeff: Although Kucha was a well-oiled machine at the  challenges, there was hostility back at camp. Alicia and Kimmi clashed over the chickens. <br/>Kimmi: What the hell is up your butt!? <br/>Alicia: Do not yell at me about the chickens. <br/>Kimmi: I am not getting...  Alicia: But don't jump all over me, sweetheart! <br/>Kimmi: I'm not getting upset. <br/>Alicia: Don't ever...  Kimmi: Don't wave your finger in my face and mumble under  your breath. <br/>Alicia: I will always wave my finger...  Kimmi: If you have something, yes. <br/>Alicia: You want me to say it to your face? <br/>Kimmi: Yes, say it to my face. <br/>Alicia: Yes, I will be happy to, I'm saying to your face  right now! <br/>Kimmi: Thank you. <br/>Alicia: I'm tired of you and the [ bleep] chickens! [ indistinct chatter]  Amber: "Just keep your wits, and you'll make it with  ease, the prize is the idol, and that's much better than cheese."  Jeff: When the note arrived for the next immunity  challenge, Ogakor decided to take charge of their desperate situation. <br/>Colby: It is going to take every ounce of-of keenness, of  smarts, of strength, of everything we have. The excuses are done. Check them at the door and let's-let's get down to business. It is going to be one hell of a show today, and it's... You  know, I think we're as ready as we're going to be. Come on! [ indistinct chatter]  Jeff: The pep talk worked. Ogakor made a sterling comeback at the maze challenge. <br/>Tina: Yeah! <br/>Colby: Come on, go, go, go! [ screaming]  Amber: Oh, yes! Whoo! [ crackling thunder]  Jeff: Kucha was finally forced to return to Tribal  Council. <br/>Alicia: She and I have not got along from the beginning. The whole food thing is really becoming an issue. It separates her from the rest of the tribe. <br/>Nick: This could be a nasty game, but you have to play  with class. <br/>Elisabeth: For a strong Kucha, it's the best vote. <br/>Jeff V.: You're a great girl, and I look forward to the  banana split on the other side with you. <br/>Jeff: The tribe and Mother Nature has spoken. Kimmi took the fall for the disharmony at Camp Kucha. With the merge of the two tribes now just around the corner,  Kucha still had a one-member advantage over Ogakor, the importance of which  was not lost on the tribe mates. <br/>Nick: We're really hoping to go in to the merger six to  four, and that way, we could just basically pick them off one by one. <br/>Jeff: But before the next immunity challenge could take  place, tragedy struck the Kucha tribe. [ Michael screaming]  Elisabeth: In the water. <br/>Nick: You okay? [ indistinct chatter] [ Michael groans]  Oh, my God! <br/>Nick: He's burned. He's burned pretty bad...  Elisabeth: Here's some water. <br/>Nick: Give him water. <br/>Jeff: Michael passed out and fell into the fire, severely  burning his hands. <br/>Nick: Stay in the water. Stay in the water. <br/>Elisabeth: Do you want me to come in with you, Mike, and  swim with you? <br/>Michael: Look at these things. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh. <br/>Nick: Oh, Mike. <br/>Elisabeth: Keep your hands in the water. <br/>Nick: Oh, my God. <br/>Mike, I'll have you lie down there, Mike. We're gonna get you home. [ Michael screaming]  See you, Mike. <br/>Colby: Bye, buddy. <br/>Rodger: Hang in there, buddy. <br/>Michael: Bye-bye. I love you guys. You guys do what's right. You guys know what to do. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: His evacuation left Kucha and Ogakor with five  members each. The field had unexpectedly been leveled for the upcoming merge. <br/>Jeff: On day 19, the merge was put into motion when tree  mail arrived for the two tribes. <br/>Amber: "Boys night out. You've wondered for weeks what's their camp like, so here's your  big chance. Send your scouts for the hike. The men will go visit while the women remain. Cook a big dinner. There will be guests to entertain." So, we'll stay here. The guys are going to come to our camp. We'll cook dinner for them. They're going to cook dinner for you guys. <br/>Colby: I better iron a shirt! <br/>Oh! [ Colby laughs]  ELISABETH &amp; Alicia: "Girls night out. The women will go visit while the fellows remain. Cook a big dinner. There will be guests to entertain."  Jeff V.: So you guys are going over there, and those girls  are coming over here. They're keeping the chicks apart. <br/>Jeff: The survivors believed they were sending scouts to  assess the livability of each other's camps and decide on a home for their  new tribe. <br/>Tina: Fee fi fo food, I smell the blood of a Kucha tribe. <br/>Alicia: What's up? <br/>Tina: Hey. <br/>Elisabeth: Hi. <br/>Jeff: But Ogakor was expecting the men of Kucha. <br/>Alicia: Can I tell you how funny this is? The guys were expecting you guys. <br/>Elisabeth: Yeah. <br/>Jerri: No! <br/>We have all the...  Keith: Anybody home? <br/>Jeff: And Kucha was expecting the women of Ogakor. <br/>Jeff V.: What? <br/>What's up, fellas? <br/>How you doing, Nick? <br/>Nick: Good. <br/>Jeff V.: So, your note said what, boys night out? <br/>Keith: Boys night out. <br/>Colby: Boys night out. <br/>Jeff V.: Ours said girls night out. <br/>Rodger: Ours said girls night out. We were expecting the women over here. <br/>Colby: Rodger, I'm real sorry, bro. I didn't even bring a skirt with me, so I can't do anything for  ya. [ laughter]  Jeff: During the visit, Jeff felt there were too many  cooks in Kucha's kitchen. <br/>Keith: ...Roasted. You pop 'em right out. Now eat like candy. It's like the tenderloin of chicken. <br/>Jeff V.: We knew Keith had brought some type of big pan  for his luxury item. And we knew that he was somewhat of an arrogant little,  whatever, and so he comes over, and he immediately starts futzing with the  pan. <br/>Keith: You want things to boil over. <br/>Jeff V.: You do? <br/>Keith: Yup. <br/>Jeff V.: You know, it's what we expected. I just hate that Alicia's not here, because I think he probably  annoyed her most. [ laughs]  Jeff: Back at Ogakor, the girls fantasized about food. <br/>Jerri: Hot fudge. <br/>Alicia: I'm, like, craving a hot dog and...  Tina: Cashews and pistachios. <br/>Amber: We're torturing ourselves. We are absolutely torturing ourselves. <br/>Alicia: Have you ever had different flavored Tootsie  Rolls, like cherry Tootsie Rolls and...? <br/>Jerri: Yes. <br/>Alicia: And vanilla. <br/>Jerri: Vanilla? <br/>Alicia: They are yummy. <br/>Jeff: On day 20, everyone agreed-- Kucha camp was the  place to live. <br/>Jerri: They have a kitchen, they have all these wonderful  things. I am so stoked about going to their camp. <br/>Tina: We've got mail! <br/>Jerri: Whoo! <br/>Jeff: But the survivors were thrown for a loop when a tree  mail note told them to start from scratch on a new beach. <br/>Elisabeth: Anxious. <br/>Tina: "You have just 15 minutes to get all your work  done. Hike back to the crock swim. The map shows you the way. Take all that you can, but the canoe's got to stay."  Amber: Oh! <br/>Jerri: We were ready to pack up and move to Camp Kucha. Roll up the flag inside. And when we looked at the map, it was a completely different  spot. Maybe they're doing the same thing, and we're going to have a  whole new camp. <br/>Amber: Yup, I think that's what it is. <br/>Jeff V.: Damn it! <br/>Things are never easy around here. <br/>Rodger: We were a little angry about it...  Colby: Six minutes. <br/>Keith: I was really frustrated with it. I just didn't want to leave there. Just... You know, we were there, we were comfortable. It was a real pain. <br/>Rodger: Let's go. <br/>Jeff: The ten remaining survivors reunited and named their  new tribe Barramundi. They then toasted their merge. <br/>ALL: Yay! [ cheering]  Alicia: You know, it was really kind of interesting,  because in the middle of all this celebrating, this game is still being  played. Every minute of every day. <br/>Jeff: Alicia was right. The first immunity challenge for Barramundi proved, old tribes  die hard. After lasting ten hours in an endurance contest, Keith, who had  prior votes stacked against him, asked Tina to let him have immunity. <br/>Keith: Hey, Tina? <br/>Tina: Hey, what? <br/>Keith: I need this. <br/>Tina: I looked over at Keith, and Keith said, "Tina,  I need this one." He must have really thought that he was going to get  the votes cast against him. It's the hardest thing I've ever done to come in. <br/>Keith: Yeah! <br/>Jeff: With the immunity talisman around his neck, Keith  was protected from the voting at Tribal Council. It was just the advantage the old Ogakor tribe needed. <br/>Jerri: We learned early on in the game that you had one  vote against you previously. <br/>Colby: It was a, uh, strategic move that was determined  the first week we were here. <br/>Jeff: After another double tie, this time between Jeff and  Colby, Jeff's vote from a previous Tribal Council came back to haunt him. Colby, how many votes have you had cast against you? <br/>Colby: Zero. <br/>Jeff: Jeff? <br/>Jeff V.: One that I know of. <br/>Jeff: Enough. Jeff was the first member voted out of the Barramundi tribe. Jeff, the tribe has spoken. [ birds calling] By day 22, the remaining members of the old  Kucha tribe decided it was time to fight back. <br/>Rodger: You know we're just sitting ducks now. <br/>Alicia: You know what? <br/>Rodger: Sitting ducks sitting by the fire. <br/>Alicia: It's not fun anymore. Laying down and talking to everybody at night is not as much fun  as it used to be. <br/>Elisabeth: We're not here to sit back and wait for someone  to vote you off. I just really would love to just light a fire under everyone. Well, that makes me sick. I'm not going to sit here and be a sitting duck. If no one else wants to keep playing, I'll do whatever it takes  to stay out here longest and keep... keep Kucha going. <br/>Jeff: Elisabeth led the fight by taking shots at the weak  links in the Ogakor alliance. <br/>Elisabeth: I think there's a crack in their tribe right  now. Pay attention to Jerri and Tina, because I think Jerri and Tina  have issues. <br/>Tina: I try to stay away from cooking so I don't have to  be judged. <br/>Jerri: Ah! <br/>Alicia: Elisabeth, although she comes across as a very  meek and mild kind of person, she is a serious competitor, believe me. Elisabeth is a force to be reckoned with. See, look at them. <br/>Jeff: Elisabeth's hunch about the wavering Ogakor alliance  wasn't farfetched. Even Colby was ready to sever all ties with Jerri. <br/>Jerri: Um, have you ever considered leading Keith and Tina  to believe that you want the three of them to be the final three? Maybe...  Colby: Oh, they're fully convinced that's what's going to  happen. <br/>Jerri: Oh, they are? <br/>Colby: I mean, they... I was painted into a corner and-and  had to lie to her to convince her that there wasn't anything going wrong. I didn't like the fact that I had to lie, but because I was  lying to Jerri, I didn't lose sleep over it. <br/>Jeff: On day 24, Keith won his second consecutive immunity  challenge, assuring once again he could not be voted out of the tribe. Again! [ applause and cheering] Congratulations. But at Tribal Council, Elisabeth's efforts to get Jerri voted  out fell short. The fragile Ogakor alliance held. <br/>Amber: Girl, you're strong inside and out, and, uh, that's  the main reason why I have to vote for you, because you're threatening. <br/>Jerri: Not only do you intimidate the hell out of the  women around here, but also the men. They are scared to death of you. <br/>Keith: This is just strictly part of the game, and it's  part of our process. <br/>Jeff: Final vote... Alicia was the eighth member to go. Alicia, the tribe has spoken. But she will return as the first member of the jury that  ultimately decides which of the final two tribe members will be the sole  survivor. The remaining members of Barramundi must now carefully consider  their voting strategies, because old tribal loyalties are now less important  than the good will of this new jury. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. Next time on Survivor. Go! The winner of the reward challenge is flown to an exotic  location. And tribal loyalties start to unravel. <br/>Colby: We're talking about a lot of money at stake. <br/>Keith: No, I understand that. I understand that. Kucha tribe's in a great position, because we are going to  sacrifice one of our Ogakor members. <br/>Alicia: Whoo! <br/>ALICIA &amp; Kimmi: Get it, get it, get it! Get it! It's right there! <br/>Kimmi: Right there! <br/>Alicia: It's right there. Get him, get him. <br/>Kimmi: What is it? <br/>Alicia: You got him! You got him. <br/>Kimmi: What is it? <br/>Alicia: Whoo! What is it? Can we eat it? <br/>Jeff V.: It's a prawn. <br/>Kimmi: It's a prawn. Yay! We need a bigger bucket. <br/>Alicia: We need bigger... We need a pot. What do you want me to do? <br/>Kimmi: Here. <br/>Jeff V.: Take it. [ Alicia mumbles] [ Jeff V. laughs]  Alicia: Oh! <br/>Kimmi: Oh, no! <br/>Alicia: No!
