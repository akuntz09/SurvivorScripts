<br/>JEFF Probst: previously on Survivor...  I'd rather be on the same page and know what's going on. <br/>Probst: Aitu was uneasy with their kidnapped Raro member in camp. <br/>He's going crazy right now. <br/>The thing I don't like is that that whole conversation happened right in  front of Nate. <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge... Rebecca quickly falling behind. ...Aitu forced Nate to sit out. <br/>Brad, why aren't you swimming? <br/>Because I'm better at puzzles. <br/>Probst: Nate watched helplessly as his Raro tribe fell behind and never  recovered. Aitu wins reward! When Nate returned to Raro...  He knows he's one of our best swimmers. <br/>Probst: ...the tribe questioned Brad's decision not to swim. <br/>We're always choking at the...  We need you swimming, brother. <br/>The thing is, I'm creative spatial. I do puzzles. <br/>Brad pissed me off. "I'm good at puzzles." I don't care about that nonsense. <br/>Probst: At Aitu...  I caught a bird. <br/>Probst: ...Ozzy's role as provider was a mixed blessing. <br/>Good job, Oz. I underestimated him. We should get rid of him while we still have the control rather than wait for  a merge and potentially have him dominate some of the individual challenges. <br/>Probst: Go, Nate! At the immunity challenge, Raro made a comeback. Raro wins immunity! Aitu, tribal council tonight, one of you going home. See you at tribal. <br/>That's the decision. <br/>Probst: Back at Aitu, Jonathan targeted Flicka. <br/>Maybe the choice is Flicka. I'm trying to stay one step I'm trying to stay one step ahead of the  competition. ahead of the competition. <br/>Probst: While Flicka tried to  Probst: While Flicka tried to target Jonathan. target Jonathan. <br/>Probst: But her scrambling pestered some of the girls. <br/>She was like a mosquito that  She was like a mosquito that won't die. won't die. <br/>Probst: And Ozzy, who was concerned about his own vulnerability, agreed that  vulnerability, agreed that Jonathan was a threat. Jonathan was a threat. <br/>Jonathan seems to inspire some level of mistrust among pretty much everybody. I haven't seen it, but because everyone else was suspicious of him, I mean,  it can't help but rub off on me a little bit. <br/>Probst: In the end... Eighth person voted out of the Cook Islands... ...Flicka's  scrambling became her downfall, and she was voted out. Jessica, the tribe has spoken. 12 are left. 12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK  TELEVISION TELEVISION  Listen, we're in a good place, right? We've really done well, the five of us. <br/>We need to stay tight. <br/>And we'll continue to stay tight. We know what the next move is if we have an elimination, right? The most solid thing is if we go in with six, and they have four, and we keep  Ozzy around for at least one vote, vote somebody off, then vote Ozzy off, and  the five of us can,, you know, go to town. People are a little antsy as we're approaching what we think is a merge in  the next couple of days. We have five strong now. I assume if there's one more immunity challenge and we lose it, we will let  go of Ozzy. But I don't care how tight you think your fivesome is, things are going to  change. <br/>You know, anything can happen  You know, anything can happen at this point. at this point. <br/>I don't want to keep this six through the merge. I want to get back together with Adam and Parvati. So I'm just ready for some movement, get some other people out of here. I'm nervous because it's kind of like the calm before the storm, you know. I think stuff's about to start I think stuff's about to start moving. moving. <br/>As much as everybody's saying, "Let's stay together with the six,"  it's going to get to a point where somebody's going to get greedy, you know  what I mean? And it's going to get ugly. And I don't, you know.... <br/>I don't want them to do it to me. <br/>Right. I don't want to be the one left out to dry. <br/>You and I are tight. We're going to make this work. Set something up with Parvati. Let's hope we can do that. Maybe it'll be us four Caucasians in the final four-- me, you, Adam,  Parvati-- and at that point, we have the numbers. And I just think we have to be the ones to make that flop before they do. I am determined to not be the guy who made the move too late, you know? I've trusted you all along, you trusted me. And it's gotten us a long way, and it's going to get us a long way further. Candice and I talked a lot about the fact that eventually we were going to  have to do some kind of flop. She's the one person that I'm the tightest with. Only two people can sit at the final two, and I want it to be you and me, I  swear to God. <br/>Jonathan's got this new plan, but I'm not sure that Jonathan has really any  allegiance. I think he'll do whatever he needs to get by, so I'd like to needs to get by,  so I'd like to see Jonathan go. see Jonathan go. <br/>Do you think we could merge now? now? <br/>We're going to merge soon. <br/>We're going to merge soon. <br/>Did you just hear that comment about, "It's everyone for  themselves"? <br/>I have to play Brad right now. He has done questionable things, you know? He's Slim Shady right now, straight-up. <br/>That infuriates me that he said that. It's not an individual game yet. <br/>We have to play for our team. <br/>We have to play for our team. <br/>No. <br/>No. <br/>I lost my trust with him, and it sucks, because I like the guy a lot. There's still team. There's no "I" in that team right now for him. And so I'll make him think, "Yeah, dog, I got your back, homey. Yeah, we tight." Yeah, we tight." Sucker. Sucker. Sucker. <br/>Probst: Raro, come on in. <br/>Probst: Raro, come on in. Aitu, come on in. Raro getting your first look at the new Aitu tribe. Jessica voted out at the last Jessica voted out at the last tribal council. tribal council. Okay, before we get to today's reward challenge, we're going to reward  challenge, we're going to do something a little different. do something a little different. I'm offering each of you the opportunity to mutiny and join the other tribe. <br/>Man! <br/>Man! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Probst: You have ten seconds to decide whether or not you want to change  things up and maybe change your fate in this game. If you want to move, step off your mat and join the other tribe. tribe. The clock is ticking. The clock is ticking. Five, four, three, two. Candice is mutinying. One. Jonathan mutinies at the last second. That is it. Jonathan, Candice, you're Aitu no more. Join Rarotonga. <br/>Hi. <br/>Hi. <br/>Welcome back. <br/>Probst: Candice you're now a member of Raro, Jonathan, a member of Raro. So, Aitu, you just had two members of your tribe mutiny. Yul, you don't look happy. <br/>No, I'm stunned. I thought we had a pretty good game plan, and I'm very surprised. <br/>Probst: Ozzy, what's your reaction? <br/>It doesn't really surprise me. They don't have the backbone to stick with their tribe, then that's fine. I'm sure that they're going to get their fate sooner or later. <br/>Probst: Okay, everybody ready to get to today's reward challenge? Two of you from each tribe will start inside a barrel. On my "go," the rest of the tribe will push you through a series of  obstacles. Along the way, you'll collect a total of four buoys which you'll then use to  float the two people in the barrel across the lagoon. When you reach the center of the lagoon, dive down and retrieve four flags. When you reach the other side of the lagoon, you'll take those four flags and  attach them to a flagpole. The entire tribe will then dig down, uncover an ax, use that ax to chop a  rope which will raise your flags. The first tribe to raise their flags wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: The winning tribe will go to a nice, relaxing environment. You'll have coffee, some muffins. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Danishes. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Probst: And because it's always nice to have something to read with your  morning cup of coffee, you will have letters from home written by your loved  ones for you. Worth playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: This is going to be two women and two men from each tribe. I'll give you a minute to strategize. In the barrel for Aitu, it is Becky and Sundra. For Raro, Jenny and Candice. Here we go. Survivors ready? Go! Both barrels heading down, a quick ride into the sand. Ozzy gets the buoys for Aitu! Adam and Nate get the buoys for Raro! Ozzy back first. Yul and Ozzy putting the buoys in the barrel. Nate and Adam back with their buoys loading in the barrel. Aitu off and running. Raro right behind. Aitu with the lead as they get to the log roll. You've got to roll them over these logs. Not going to be a comfortable Not going to be a comfortable ride. ride. <br/>Probst: Aitu still with a bit of a lead. Nate and Adam right behind. Once you hit your mat, you can get your next two buoys. Aitu on the mat! Raro's on the mat. Ozzy back with the buoys for Aitu. Nate and Adam back with the buoys for Raro. Two new tribes battling it out. Who made the right move? Who made the wrong move? Candace and Jenny suffocating with all the buoys inside. Got to get those buoys clipped to the barrels so you can float to the barrels  so you can float across the lagoon. across the lagoon. Ozzy and Yul in the water. Raro still struggling. They've got to get in deeper water. Aitu is now floating their barrel. Raro now in the deep enough water. They can start floating, but Aitu has a big lead at this point. point. Aitu has reached their flag. Aitu has reached their flag. Ozzy's got the first flag. Ozzy's got the first flag. Raro cannot get there. Raro cannot get there. Ozzy up with the second flag. Ozzy up with the second flag. Raro is floating away. Raro is floating away. Ozzy comes up with his final two flags. He's got all four. Raro cannot fight the current. Let's go! Raro, no chance of getting back. Aitu now on the other side. Ozzy and Yul have been workhorses on this challenge. <br/>Get out, get out! <br/>Probst: big reward on the line. Somebody going to Exile Island. Becky's going to hang the flags. <br/>Come on! <br/>Probst: Aitu has their four flags. Now they've got to find the ax. Now they've got to find the ax. They've found the ax. They've found the ax. Aitu wins reward! <br/>Yes! <br/>Yes! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! <br/>Probst: Well, it would be an understatement to say that this game has just  taken a dramatic turn. Aitu, as winners, you are sending somebody from the Raro tribe to Exile  Island. <br/>Hmm...  Probst: who's it going to be? <br/>Candice. <br/>Probst: Candice, big signal coming from your old tribe. coming from your old tribe. Let's go, Candice. Let's go, Candice. Raro, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head on back to camp. Sundra, you're crying. <br/>Because, you know, I wanted to stay true to my guys, and we worked well  together. Feels good. <br/>Probst: Well, in this case, it certainly paid off to stick together. You have a big reward-- coffee, tasty assortment of pastries, love letters  from home just behind you. Grab your stuff. Grab your stuff. Head on over. Head on over. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>I love you guys! <br/>I love you guys! <br/>Yeah, I can't believe it. <br/>Yeah, I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. <br/>Me, too. I don't know when I've felt like this. When I saw the mutiny in its completion, the numbers were scary. Standing there and you're feeling so small and pitiful and you look over to  the Raro side, and they look so big and triumphant. And when we won the challenge, I cried. I straight up cried. I don't think I've ever been as happy in my life. <br/>All right, let's have a toast, guys. <br/>To Aitu. <br/>To Aitu. <br/>To Aitu. <br/>Working together, keeping calm, cool, collected. <br/>This will take us to the end, guys. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Oh, the reward was beautiful. We had these dry robes that we could put on. And then laid out before us was every kind of pastry you can think of. It was like a recharge, you know? I feel, like, brand new. I feel like I'm ready to do I feel like I'm ready to do anything. anything. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Who is it? <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>That's you? Oh, you were so cute! <br/>Oh, sexy Becky. I love it. <br/>That's my son. <br/>Oh, my god, he's adorable. <br/>Okay, I like this one. <br/>All right...  No, we're seeing these. <br/>I'm feeling really good about my tribe. When you see each other's families and see pictures of each other growing up,  I mean, it just really hits you that these are real people that you're  interacting with, you know-- people that with hopes, know-- people that with  hopes, dreams, fears, aspirations. dreams, fears, aspirations. <br/>I haven't seen my son in three weeks, and in the letter, he was like, "I  hope you're fine." And he said that he was really concerned that I'm not  alone. I have a great little boy, and I'm realizing, "What the hell am I doing  here?" But I always teach my son "Winners never quit, and quitters  never win," so I can't teach him that and come out here teach him that  and come out here and quit. and quit. <br/>That's Ozzy. <br/>Ozzy needs a hug. <br/>Ozzy needs a hug. <br/>Aww...  Aww...  We are stronger than we've ever been. The mutiny solidified our commitment and dedication to each other. I mean, we're a team to the end now. <br/>Oh, there's nothing in here. I've been waiting the whole time to get back with my friends Adam and Parvati. So I made the decision to mutiny. You know, it's four people on the old Aitu tribe that are really mad at me  right now. Obviously they're going to have it out for me. I was surprised that Jonathan stepped out right behind me. He's been saying that we were really, really close, and we've been tight the  whole time, but I haven't really trusted Jonathan to begin with. Now I'm here, sitting on Exile Island by myself, while Jonathan is bonding,  having a good time, is bonding, having a good time, and I'm out of the game. and I'm out of the game. <br/>Wow, here I am. <br/>You're back. <br/>I took a step into the unknown, guys. I wanted to be here and meet some of you folks. So were you guys totally shocked...  I was. <br/>...at Candice and I wanting to come over here? <br/>No. <br/>No? Good. <br/>What? <br/>I mean, it's a crazy thing to do. And Candice and I are the last two in here. I don't know how tight you guys are, but it seemed like the right thing to  do, you know. If I've made a mistake it was in trusting Candice too much, and she made an  impulsive move and I followed her. So I'm in the danger seat now. I'm the eighth man in. I consider myself a loyal person, and Candice and I have been together  through the whole thing. You know, I saw her do it and I said, "Okay, let's go." My game  plan is to earn their trust, and the only way I can do that right now is by  being totally non-threatening and anxious to help. And listen, I hope it doesn't bite me in the butt, but...  Welcome. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I knew Candice was going to come over, but my man Jonathan rolled over too  with her. You must be smoking some good stuff if you think you're going to roll up into  our crib and just start stirring waters, you know? Brad is going to be safe for a vote if it has to come to that, you know? Because he at least stood with us and said, "I'm not budging." So  the first one, definitely, is Jonathan. There was no question about that. To really think we all have your back after we just saw you sell out your  other tribe? out your other tribe? Are you dumb? Are you dumb? <br/>You're good around camp. You're a workhorse. <br/>I'm out here to do this, you know? We could get voted off tomorrow. I don't know what's going to happen. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You know what I mean? Sometimes opportunity knocks, you've got to just walk through the door and  hope for the best. So for me and Candice, the risky time is the next two votes. <br/>I know. <br/>Listen, I don't know what's going on over here. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Just so you know, she and I wanted to come back and deal with you and Parvati. <br/>Yeah, I know. I understand that, I understand that. <br/>You know what I mean? <br/>That's cool with me. I'll do that. Because we're the original tribe, man. Jonathan really wants myself, him, Candice, and Parvati to be the final four. You know, just to have someone there that wants that and wants to include me  is good to have to include me is good to have along the ride. along the ride. along the ride. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Candice, We'll now bring in Candice, returning from Exile  Island. returning from Exile Island. <br/>Hey, guys. <br/>Hey, guys. <br/>Hey! <br/>Hey! <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right, first things first. things first. Let's take back immunity. Let's take back immunity. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will paddle out in glass-bottom boats searching  for three underwater targets. When you line up the crosshairs on your target with the crosshairs on your  boat, you'll release a cannonball, which will drop from the boat, hitting a  target, releasing a pair of buoys. When you have all the buoys back to shore, use the buoys to solve a word  puzzle. One buoy provides a clue. The rest of the buoys will form the one-word answer. First tribe to solve it correctly wins immunity, guaranteed a one in 11 shot  at a million bucks. Losers go to tribal council tonight. Somebody will be voted out. Make sense? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Raro, you have four extra members. You cannot sit out the same people in back-to-back challenges, so your  decision is made. The people who participated yesterday will sit out today. Take your spots, we'll get started. All right, for Raro it's Parvati, Jonathan, Rebecca, and Brad taking on  Becky, Ozzy, Yul, and Sundra for Aitu. Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready? Go! You're looking for three targets releasing three pairs of buoys. Both tribes pushing their boats as far as they can. <br/>Get in, Yul. <br/>Probst: Aitu first to start paddling. Raro is paddling. Raro immediately off the course. <br/>Turn, turn, left. <br/>I see the first one over here. I see the first one over here. <br/>Okay. <br/>All right, slow down, slow down. <br/>Okay. <br/>Backpedal, backpedal. <br/>Probst: Aitu trying to line up their first target. <br/>Okay, tell me whenever you're ready. One, two... drop it. Do it! <br/>Probst: Aitu releases a cannonball. <br/>We were right on it. <br/>Probst: Just off. <br/>Over here, straight! <br/>Probst: Both tribes searching for that first set of buoys. Raro very close to their buoys. <br/>You guys ready? <br/>Probst: Brad and Parvati trying to line it up. <br/>Okay. <br/>Drop, drop, drop, drop! <br/>Probst: Jonathan releases a cannonball for Raro. <br/>Backwards. Straight back. <br/>Probst: Misses the target. <br/>Backpedal a little bit, just a little. <br/>Probst: Aitu, can they get the crosshairs lined up? <br/>Just a little bit, drop! <br/>Probst: No luck. This challenge demands that you work together well. <br/>Brad, paddle a little bit on your side. <br/>Probst: Raro easing into it...  Okay, a little bit more. <br/>Probst: ...gently. <br/>Now. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Raro has the first pair of buoys. <br/>My god! <br/>Nice, guys! <br/>Here we go-- one, two, three, drop. <br/>Probst: Aitu misses again. <br/>Here we go. <br/>It's right in front of us. <br/>Here it comes, here it comes. <br/>Probst: Raro taking a shot at their second set of buoys. <br/>Wait. <br/>Okay, ready? <br/>Drop! <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Raro releases their second set of buoys. Raro now leads two sets of buoys to none for Aitu. <br/>Right there. <br/>Probst: Aitu very close to their buoys. <br/>Should I just go for it? <br/>No. <br/>I think I got it. I got it! See? <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>Probst: Aitu releases their first set of buoys. Raro heading to their final set of buoys...  Okay, wait. All right, we're going to have to backpedal. <br/>Probst: ...and drifting off course. <br/>Just keep doing what we're doing. We're doing good. <br/>Probst: Aitu trying to get their second set of buoys. <br/>We're very close. Okay. Okay, yes. Yes, we're... try it. <br/>Probst: Aitu misses again. <br/>Through here. <br/>Hold on, hold on, hold on. <br/>Hold on, hold on, hold on. He sees it. He sees it. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Aitu connects with their second set of buoys. We are now tied, two sets each. <br/>I can spot the thing through the...  Shhh! <br/>Probst: Both tribes now with one target left. <br/>All right, all right, let's get the last one, guys. <br/>And go, go, go! <br/>Release again, release! Backwards. We missed it. <br/>Probst: Raro misses again. <br/>We're going to lose all our...  Raro just wasted a cannonball. They weren't paying attention. <br/>Oh, please, Jeff. <br/>Probst: What's that? <br/>I said, oh, please! <br/>Probst: Jonathan getting frustrated by me. Day 21. <br/>We're going to drift over it. <br/>Probst: Aitu sees their  Probst: Aitu sees their target. target. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Aitu takes a shot and releases their third set of buoys. Aitu now has all three sets. They can begin paddling back to shore. Raro still right on top of their third set of buoys. Going after another shot. <br/>I got it! <br/>Probst: Aitu has all their buoys. They're paddling back to shore. Raro not giving up! Got to hit that third target! <br/>Now! <br/>We blew it! <br/>Did it drop? <br/>All right, we're on the mat. <br/>Probst: Aitu back to the mat. Got to get all their buoys back to the big mat. <br/>Let's go! <br/>Jonathan, paddle forward. Don't watch them. Look at what we're doing. <br/>All right, this says "The most famous mutiny in history occurred aboard  this ship."  Probst: Aitu working to get  Probst: Aitu working to get this puzzle together. this puzzle together. Bounty. Aitu wins immunity! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Are you kidding me? <br/>Son of a...  Probst: Well, Aitu, another big win today. Immunity, no tribal council, nobody going home. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Probst: On the other side of the coin, Raro, two big losses. Tribal council tonight. Somebody from this tribe will be voted out of this game. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. camp. I'll see you at tribal. I'll see you at tribal. <br/>I'm so bummed out. <br/>So sorry, guys. <br/>Goodness, gracious, that was stupid. <br/>I saw you say that...  I'm a little hungry, but it was...  Well, luckily, you were only out there one night and it wasn't raining, right? <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>I'm happy to have Candice back from Exile Island. It takes a little bit of the onus off of me being the only new guy. They can see who the two of us are, and she and I have trusted are, and she  and I have trusted each other. each other. <br/>Not tight. <br/>Not tight? Not too tight? <br/>No. <br/>Okay, good. <br/>Not too tight at all. I was shocked. He had, like, long talks with Yul all the time. And he only really came back and tried to, like, solidify something with me  in the past few days. He's just doing whatever is best for him and, like, working everybody at the  same time, you everybody at the same time, you know what I mean? know what I mean? know what I mean? <br/>What's up? <br/>What's up? <br/>Jonathan, AKA "Lord Knows What He's Thinking Knucklehead," to leave  his tribe, is working very hard around here. So right now, we're going to do away with Brad, because we're scared if we go  to a merge, he's going to go with Becky and Yul. I've got to put a Denzel on today and play Brad like it's all good, you know,  like, keep him in the loop. He thinks I'm out to cut up Jonathan, so I'm going to let Jonathan, so I'm  going to let him think he's safe. him think he's safe. [ yawns] What's up, brother? <br/>What's up? Were you sleeping? Were you sleeping? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Who? <br/>Who? <br/>Who? <br/>Okay, that's fine. <br/>Okay, that's fine. <br/>Candice informed me that Jonathan's been running his mouth a little bit, just  talking trash, which I think is funny because now he's kissing my butt along  with everybody else's butt in our tribe. So he can just kiss our butts, and we'll go ahead and vote him and we'll go  ahead and vote him off after that. off after that. <br/>I want to get rid of that kid. I mean, now he's kissing everyone's butt after that. <br/>I told you, man, he's a punk[1]ass...   I know he is. He's a punk. But, I mean, we can't switch now. I'm going to beat his ass. <br/>He's a punk. <br/>He's a punk. <br/>My man Adam wants to take a brick and beat Jonathan in the head with it. <br/>You know, I told you I smelled dookie, dog. <br/>Pisses me off. <br/>But we've got to think smart. Game's not over yet, so it's a Game's not over yet, so it's a fair playing  ground. fair playing ground. <br/>Probst: Looks like it's going to be a wet night. So let's talk about the mutiny. Brad, when you saw Candice step off the mat, followed right behind by  Jonathan, what was your initial thought? <br/>My initial thought was, "Wow, that is one gutsy girl." I mean, here  she has four people now vying against her. <br/>Probst: Jenny, is there a part of you thinking, "Well, you know what,  that's okay"? They're at the bottom of the totem pole. They need to know that. <br/>Even though they're on the bottom of the totem pole we have an advantage  compared to the Aitu. And if we merge, we're just going to pick them off like zits. I've been hanging around Nate too long. <br/>Probst: Candice, are you okay with the fact that this tribe comes to tribal  council, where somebody is going to be voted out, and there's joking and  laughter? <br/>I think that's the great thing about this tribe, and it's one of the reasons  I stepped out on the mat. I felt like this tribe has a good time. <br/>Probst: So you're telling me, Candice, that you stepped off that mat because  you could just sense that Raro was just a lot more fun? <br/>I didn't say that was the only reason. That's one of the reasons. I mean, they win when it counts. <br/>Probst: Jonathan, are you a little bit concerned that "I could be an  easy guy to get rid of?" Because they didn't invite you over. You were given the opportunity to just join them. <br/>Of course I'm concerned, you know? I was the last guy off the mat. Maybe it was a second later. But yes, you know, somebody's going to go home tonight, and I'd be silly if I  didn't think it could be me. <br/>Probst: Nate, what's your take on this unit right now as a tribe, or as a  family, whatever you want to call it? <br/>My six I had yesterday before mutiny, I was all good with. The other two coming in, Candice and Jonathan, they seem very nice, so, you  know, we're still adapting to them. I can't really give you a fair, honest answer about them because I'm still  reading them. <br/>Probst: What would be the concern about Candice? <br/>Oh, the girls may find her as a threat because she's pretty lethal-- the only  female who has ever been to exile, and, you know, she comes up with her head  high from it, too. And, like, she's a very strong competitor. The girl came to play. <br/>Probst: What would be your concern about Jonathan coming over? <br/>Maybe he has a tendency to be too much of a leader, and we don't dig that  over here. We find out you're leading around here, we'll cut you up, you know? <br/>Probst: Jonathan, hearing Nate say that, is it a fair assessment? <br/>You know, yes, I'm an odd man out at this point, and I do want to fit in. You know, in the last 24 hours, I think I've at least tried to certainly not  step on anybody's toes and tried to, you know, provide. <br/>Probst: Brad, did you sense any tension in this tribe? <br/>I like Jonathan. I like Candice from the six hours that I know of. I've got no qualms with them. The only thing is, they're stepping in late in the ball game, and that's what  I can see as a huge deterrent for them being successful within this tribe. And that's it. That's the bottom line. <br/>Probst: Do you trust these people in this tribe now? <br/>No. <br/>Probst: Wow. You don't trust this big, happy family? <br/>Do I trust the entire tribe? Absolutely not. I'm sorry. It's been 21 days, and trust is a big word to me, Jeff, and no, I don't trust  everyone on this tribe. <br/>Probst: Okay. If somebody has the hidden immunity idol, and it turns out that you do need  to play it, you would present it to me after the vote. The person with the next highest number of votes would go home. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Candice, you're up.
