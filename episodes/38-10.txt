<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor, the majority had plan of  attack. <br/>Aurora has good to go. <br/>Jeff: But Wardog wanted to shake up the game. <br/>Vote Kelley tonight. It's time to make a move on the last returning player, and  that's Kelley Wentworth. At tribal council Wardog left Lauren in the dark and betrayed  his closest ally. <br/>A lot of lying going on. <br/>Jeff: When he voted out Wentworth. Wentworth, the tribe has spoken. And she grabbed the torch and headed to the Edge of Extinction. <br/>Down to eight. <br/>Tribal council sucked. It's really sad the lose Kelley, not just on like a  "Survivor" level with someone who I genuinely trusted, but on a personal  level, she felt like my older sister. So I'll just be first to say anybody want to... Obviously two  people flipped. I think I can guess who it is, but do you guys want to say it? <br/>Ron and Wardog. <br/>Ron and Wardog? I'm so angry and so mad at Wardog. I actually kind of feel like I'm out for flood. At the same time, I also want the take Rick out just because Rick  poses a threat to everyone, but I don't know who wants to work with me  anymore. I think I can get others to rally behind me, but it is this  weird feeling of I don't know where people stand anymore. <br/>It was mice being in on it instead of being on the outs. But that's part of it. <br/>When you say to me, I just wish I was in on it, you only  wish you were in on it after the votes were done. <br/>I thought we still could have waited. <br/>Because Kelley had allies. If anything I couldn't take Kelley out. <br/>You had allies also. <br/>There was no wait, because I don't think you were going to  flip on her. You go where the numbers go. <br/>I thought me, you and Ron were the tightest. <br/>I trusted Wardog 100%. Going into tribal council, I felt really confident in my game. I was left out of the vote, so now I know that bridge is burned. Wardog is just barking out orders. Wardog talked to me like a dog. I ain't having that. <br/>Right now I'm upset, Gavin. You like to stay with the numbers all the way. You don't like rocking the boat. <br/>You can't be barking out orders 24/7 and expect people to  work with you. He's next on my list. I want Wardog out now. I hate that Wardog got as pissed as he did. -he got pissed here. <br/>He talked to me like a dog. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I'd rather make big moves with you all than be talked to  like a dog. I ain't about that life. I feel like I'm next on the chopping block. <br/>That's not true. <br/>Well, not in my mind, buddy. <br/>I was working with Wardog to get out Kelley, but then I'm  thinking, he's a loose cannon. He says too much. He talked to Gavin like Gavin was ten years old, and it really  hurt Gavin's feeling. It's perfect because it cut those two in half. <br/>I'll do whatever, make a move wherever you guys want, and  I'm an easy vote for it. So appreciate you guys. <br/>I feel like my game is going pretty good because I have  lots of different options and I'm trying the play both sides. The only thing I was worried about was Julie, because she's the  one I need to mend fences with. <br/>I'm in the like that. I'm not super emotional. As emotional as I am in this game --  I feel so bad. <br/>But it's wetter -- better for us not to always vote  together. <br/>I'm with you, and I have something else to tell you. Aurora gave me her extra vote to show trust. It's still her, but I have it. If she had gone home tonight, I was going to use it. <br/>Are you kidding me? <br/>No. <br/>I told Julie about the extra vote, because I need Julie to  feel confident and trust me so that she's completely loyal to me. <br/>I'll watch you back as long as you watch mine. <br/>I want to work with you until the end. <br/>I do want to work with you, too. You're with me, I'm with you. <br/>Even though I clearly was left out of tonight's vote, I  don't blame Ron at all. It was a good move. I have no hard feelings against Ron. He's the only person in the game I feel like I can truly trust. I do think he has my back. <br/>Nice. <br/>There's a lot of lying going on. <br/>At tribal last night, Ron, myself, and Wardog voted  together to get rid of Kelley. And no one was happier than me that Kelley Wentworth was headed  to the Edge of Extinction. So Ron and Wardog and I kind of need each other. So here's a realization that I had, okay, that we're the only  threats in players in the game. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We're the only ones with the resume. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think those girls haven't been players, but they're  going to want to build their resume, and none of them are going to take us to  the end. <br/>I am totally with that. I don't want either one of you all gone. If we turn on each other too soon, none of us get. There we all agree on that. We're each other's biggest threat and our only hope. <br/>I hear you. <br/>Wardog has been my nemesis in this game, but now we need  each other going forward as a shield, because as soon as one of us goes out,  it will be a feeding frenzy. I see the people that have not built mump of a resume starting  to build their resume by getting rid of one threat after the other. <br/>We got to take the girls out. <br/>The three of us get rid of Aurora. <br/>Take Aurora out. <br/>And then just work it from there. <br/>Aurora is definitely on the bottom. She's an easy vote. Because she's been named every tribal, everyone was going for Aurora. She's a big competitor. She's a challenge beast. And you never know what she's going to say at tribal. <br/>The only way we can protect each other is if we stay  together. So I think the three of us need to figure out a way we stay. <br/>Yeah. <br/>The game I'm playing right now is Ron is everyone's ally,  and if I don't work with you right now, maybe next time. <br/>We have to convince them to vote out a lesser threat as  opposed to a bigger threat. That could be tRicky. <br/>We have to stick together for at least a few more votes. <br/>If we take Aurora out, there is no plot against her. <br/>The road ahead of me will be difficult. Either way I can join either alliance. So I've got a tough decision to make. I love having power and control. And it puts me in the middle again where I get to make a  decision. <br/>Jeff: All right. Let's get to today's reward challenge. For today's challenge, you're going to swim out to a platform,  run across it, jump in, pull yourself under the platform, retrieve a ring, and  race to the finish. Once you have all three rings, you'll attempt to land them on  three targets. First four finish win reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: You'll be taken from here to the sabato mud baths  where you will enjoy sandwich, chicken, shredded pork, roast beef, salad,  wine, juice, and brownies for dessert. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Treat your body both inside and out. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: We're going to do a schoolyard pick. <br/>Let's do this! <br/>All right! <br/>Jeff: All right. We have our two teams. For blue, it is Lauren, Wardog, Devens, and Julie. For yellow it's Ron, Aurora, Gavin, and Victoria. For reward, here we go. Survivors ready? Go! Wardog off the a slippery start. <br/>Good job, Wardog. <br/>Good job, Ron. <br/>Wardog. <br/>Jeff: Wardog is swimming to the wRong platform. <br/>Watch out, Wardog. You're going to wRong way. <br/>To your right. To your right, Wardog. <br/>Jeff: Ron gets there first. You have to get up and race across it. <br/>Come on, Ron. Push it, brother. <br/>Jeff: Get across. Jump in and pull yourself under. Wardog and Ron come up for air. Wardog is there. Ron is there. <br/>Good job, Wardog. <br/>That aboy, Ron. <br/>Jeff: Now you're going to untie one ring. <br/>One ring. <br/>That's it, buddy. <br/>Jeff: Wardog has his. Ron has his. Wardog in the water first. There goes Ron. <br/>Nice, Ron. <br/>You got this, dog. <br/>Jeff: You got to get back on the platform before the next  person can go. <br/>Come on, come on, come on. <br/>Jeff: Gavin pulls up Ron. Go, yellow! Go, blue! It's Aurora whipping through the water. <br/>Go, Aurora. <br/>Jeff: Aurora is on fire. Lauren back up now. <br/>Good job, good job. <br/>Jeff: Lauren trying to stay in it. She's back in the water. <br/>Good job, Lauren. Good job. <br/>Jeff: Aurora does not come up for air. <br/>Damn. <br/>Jeff: Lauren pops up for air, slowing down a little more. Aurora is whipping through this challenge. Aurora back in the water. <br/>Amazing toss. <br/>Jeff: That's how you do it on "Survivor," right  there. <br/>Good job, Lauren. <br/>Jeff: Lauren is untying her ring. <br/>Good job, good job. <br/>Jeff: There goes Lauren. <br/>Good job. <br/>Jeff: Trying to get Aurora back on the platform. You're good, yellow. Get in the water. Now you got to land those rings, one on each post. Yellow with a big lead. Lauren is back for blue. You're good. Get in the water. Gavin connects for yellow. Yellow has one. Devens just misses with his second. Devens trying the keep it close. Devens connects. It is 1-1. <br/>Good job. <br/>Jeff: And just like that it is blue in the lead. Gavin now is the one that's got to pick it up. Gavin hits. On and off. Devens could win it right here. Just short. Gavin trying the tie it up. No. <br/>Dang. <br/>Jeff: Devens one more time for the win. Devens does it! Julie, Lauren, Wardog, and Devens win reward. All right. Devens, Wardog, Julie, Lauren, nice afternoon awaits. Bring it in. Your chariot awaits. Hop on. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Aurora, Gavin, Ron, Victoria, I got nothing for you. Swim out. <br/>So we lost the reward challenge, but now this is an opportunity  for me to build a stRong relationship with Victoria, Ron, and Aurora. I feel like Wardog has it out for me, but I want a little sweet  revenge, and I want his head on a silver platter. <br/>Honestly, I have not had one fun day here. That's why I'm so mad. <br/>This game is so hard. <br/>I feel like I'm just going to cry. <br/>Sorry. <br/>I'll try not to be a hot mess around camp. Ly remove myself. <br/>You're okay. <br/>I know, I know. I know, you've been through it. I know. <br/>Getting voted out with an idol in my pocket, knowing I  made a mistake, knowing I'm a perfectionist, I feel mad at myself because I  didn't trust my gut and I should have. <br/>You all feel better? Give her a hug. Group hug. <br/>Usually when you leave the game and head somewhere and  mask all these feelings, but you come to the edge still dealing with it. And I know that I will beat myself up over this for a long time. Yesterday at camp we were having conversations and I was like,  don't be paranoid. You have to laugh at it all. It's a game. <br/>It's so hard. <br/>Finally Kelley gets voted out. Like I don't know what the hell took them so long. I was trying to do that on day three which ended up getting me  voted out. I mean, bravo. Finally. Kama is so stupid. I'm happy that went down. She said, huh, liars. I was like, listen, dude, karma. Karma's a bitch. That's what happens. Kelley, I'm not going to lie to you, I'm mad. I'm sure you picked up on that. I feel like my "Survivor" experience wasn't because of  you. <br/>Well, I apologize, Reem. I really don't. <br/>But don't act like people don't come here and have  diarrhea of the mouth about what's going on. Everybody is talking about what's going on, you know what I  mean? Kelley was part of getting rid of me, kind of killed my  "Survivor" dream, per se. So that sucks. It sucks as a super fan. It sucks. So I had to say something. I really did. Because everyone here at Edge of Extinction is mad at somebody,  and if you don't let it off your chest, it is just going to get ugly, and  it's going to fester, so get it off your chest. Everybody knows there's a healing process once you're here, but  it takes time. <br/>I came in this time with the idea I would have to be more  open and vulnerable and connect with people, so getting voted out and coming  to the edge does make me like face my demons in a way. Like I realize I'm so competitive. And I think I'm a very tough cookie, tough exterior, and I'm not  super vulnerable, and so I just hope that this experience translates into  real life and helps me grow as a person. Because what's important is what's back home. Like I have a husband who has allowed me to do this three times. I have family who is probably going to laugh at the fact they  was an idiot and went home with an idol in my pocket. So even though this is not easy. <br/>You've been out here a while. I think you may want to get out of the sun. <br/>Hopefully once this chapter is closed on the Edge of  Extinction, I will look back and say, I made my mistakes, I'm at peace with  it, and it was also a great experience in its own way. Peace with it, and it was also a great experience in its own  way. <br/>We come back the camp after losing the reward, and it's  disappointing. I haven't eaten really in 11 days. But losing today is a great opportunity. <br/>So I'm thinking what if we stoke some coconut and coffee. <br/>Coconut and coffee? Because I know this afternoon I'll have time with Victoria, Aurora,  and Gavin. So hopefully it buys me a little time to figure out what's best  for me. <br/>Let's have a day in paradise, how about that? <br/>That was fun, the challenge. <br/>Devens is very athletic. He's probably one of the least typical, but he's a beast. <br/>I think all Devens did again today is prove how much he  has to go. <br/>Yep. <br/>Devens is definitely the most dangerous. <br/>I think we can all vote Devens. <br/>I'm letting you know what I need to do. I'm an easy vote for you. <br/>The group was leaning toward taking Rick Devens, who is a  favorite from the jury's point of view. I'd rather fake out Wardog because he betrayed me, unfortunately  I have to be adaptable. I have to go with the numbers at this point because I have no  traction, but I think eventually Wardog is going to crumble, and I'll still  be here. <br/>We all put our votes on Devens. <br/>I truly think it's if best move. <br/>Yep. <br/>Before tribal council Aurora gave me her extra vote. For a moment I'm thinking maybe I could keep the vote for  myself, but then I'm thinking, I'd rather give it back to her because that's  a better move for me. I'm trying to get Aurora to trust me completely, and I think if  she feels, that she will do whatever I need her to do. Or if I choose, I can vote her out. She won't see it coming. <br/>The tide is really low, so I'm going to bring basket down  and see if I can find some snails. <br/>I'm going to keep eating until you come back. And I high still keep eating. <br/>I'm going to cook a lot of rice. <br/>Do one cup. Ron, we've got to keep going on this. We don't have that much left. <br/>No, one cup for four is going to be perfectly fine. <br/>Aurora, you're not the rice nazi. <br/>I'd rather --  Ron is the quickest to get snappy when he doesn't get his  way. At this point we are literally dating each other when all we  want to do is break up. It is the drama queen in Ron that comes outs, but I'm used to  being around drama queens because I am one. So you're not going to win with me. <br/>Tomorrow we move to three scoops a day. <br/>Aurora gets on my nerves so bad. She wants to have control of every situation every moment. I have made it a month with Aurora. If I have to go to 39 days with her, I need to get $2 million,  not $1 million. <br/>Is the tide still low? <br/>Want to go look at it real quick? <br/>You're driving me crazy. <br/>It feels good. <br/>That feels so good. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>Very nice. <br/>Today is a great day. We won the challenge. I got chance to get my body right. I can feel relaxed. I have some time away from camp. I'll recharge, right? I got 11 more days in this game. I know the end is near, and this will be the boost I need. <br/>Want me to get your back? Testify come on, you do my become an I'll do yourings. Oh yeah,. <br/>Oh,  Nothing better than having Devens rub mud on me. <br/>I have dreamed of this since day one. Finally, day 28. Wardog and I have, who have had such an up-and-down game  strategically, are rubbing the mud on each other. <br/>Oh, look at that. And we cover each other head to toe. We're having fun. The girls are doing the same thing. This is a bonding experience. <br/>We're going to be very close after this. <br/>You want the talk on heaven. Heaven is getting mud rubbed on you by Wardog in Fiji. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>It's like a hot tub. <br/>This feels amazing. <br/>I love hot water. <br/>Going into this reward, the way the teams worked out, I'm  not looking at it as a strategic opportunity, because Lauren and Julie are  not playing the game. They're just going where the wind blows. They're not in the driver's seat, and they seem okay with&amp;4p  so it's just a really cool human opportunity to bond with everybody in a way  to step away from the game for a little while. <br/>Oh, man. Yeah. That will wake you up in the morning. <br/>How is it? <br/>It's nice. It's a little cold. <br/>Okay. Just get clean. We've heard every girl's name mentioned as somebody who would be  beatable in the end, like a girl to take to the end some here's the deal. I'm trying the figure out how to shape things up. I have an idea. <br/>Okay. <br/>We take out Rick. <br/>I think Wardog is worse than Rick. I could see him winning the game. <br/>I think as long as Wardog is in the game, we have someone  that everyone can agree. <br/>I'm telling you --  I trust you. <br/>I trust you. Ly not turn on you. <br/>Julie is talking about how she wants Wardog gone, but I  don't know that's the smartest move. <br/>Thank you so much. <br/>Good job today. <br/>I think Devens is much more dangerous than anyone else on  this beach. So now I have to convince people to take Rick out. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. Let's get to today's immunity challenge. First things first, Devens. Take back the necklace. <br/>All right. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge we'll race over an obstacle carrying a  buoy. You'll then maneuver a second buoy threw a long tunnel. Finally you'll gab your third buoy and fall under a net. You'll then use the keys attached to unlock a puzzle. First person to finish their star puzzle wins immunity,  guaranteed to see day 30. Losers tribal council where somebody will be the 12th person  voted out of this game. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! This first obstacle you cannot touch the ground in between. You have to jump from one to another. Everybody looking good. That's how you do it. Aurora is out first. Gavin is there. Devens. Lauren. Victoria. Wardog is through. Julie is over. Now you're maneuvering a second buoy. Ron working on that and he's got it. Ron's good now. Aurora quickly through. Gavin on her tail. Julie is in it. Devens has his. He's through. Aurora working on that third buoy. She's got it. There goes Gavin. Devens right on his tail. Devens is whipping through this third part of the challenge. It's now Aurora and Devens that are coming out at exactly the  same moment. Now you got to use one of those three keys to unlock the lock,  holding your puzzle. Gavin is through. Wardog pushing. Here comes Victoria. Lauren trying to get through this. Julie is in it. Once you've got that lock open, get rid of it and start working  on the puzzling. Lauren is through. Here comes Julie and Ron. Everybody now with their puzzle. This is what you want on day 29. Everybody with a shot. Eight people left in this game. You want the make it to seven and day 30, here's your chance. You are building a star puzzle. Everybody is looking for some clue. What is it about this puzzle? Is there a pattern? Is there something I can figure out that will help me solve it? <br/>I hate puzzles. <br/>Jeff: Devens making a little progress. Gavin's got some progress. Aurora is moving quickly. She's right. She's got something going. Gavin and Devens have a few pieces in place. The question is, are they in the right place? Ron not much of anything yet. Julie nothing. Victoria nothing. Lauren not much. Wardog has a few pieces in place. It's Aurora now with something. <br/>Come on. <br/>Jeff: Devens continues, piece by piece. He's got something going and he knows it. Can anybody catch him now is the question? It is Aurora and Devens right now in the lead. Nobody else really close. Devens has hit a roadblock now. That opens the door for Aurora. Aurora with another piece. Devens with another piece. Getting closer and closer. <br/>I got it. I got it. <br/>Jeff: Devens has it. Individual immunity for Devens. Safe tonight at tribal council. Wow. The pieces started going together fast. Devens, come on over. Second time in a row individual immunity, safe tonight at tribal  council. As for the rest of you, tonight somebody will be the 12th person  voted out of this game. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. Congrats. <br/>Before the immunity challenge we had this plan to get Devens  out, but as soon as Rick wins, it just snaps in my head, it's got to be Wardog. People know the game Wardog is playing. If he gets to the end, he will win this game. Hopefully people open their eyes and see we have the get Wardog  out right now. Sayonara, Wardog. I can't wait to see him go. <br/>I was so mad when Rick con immunity today. I really wanted him out of here. He's such a threat. The more he sticks around, I think the more dangerous he  becomes. <br/>Congratulations. <br/>Thanks, guys. <br/>You said you're not good at puzzles. <br/>I didn't think I was. <br/>Our plan was going to be that Rick goes home, but Rick is  safe  Wardog and Rick are the two big threats of game. One of the threats won immunity, so maybe you vote the other one  out. It can be as simple as that. <br/>I was freaking out this morning that it was going to be  me. <br/>Want to go to the fire with me. <br/>I would love that. <br/>Let's go. <br/>So Devens won immunity. <br/>What about Wardog? <br/>Don't forget. <br/>Wardog says that if all the threats in the game are gone,  the next largest threat would go. If we take out Wardog, that leaves me in the hot seat, because  I'm the next biggest threat. <br/>No matter what he says, he's going home. <br/>Here he comes. <br/>I have a tough decision to make. Do I send home Wardog with my vote and align with Aurora, Victoria,  or Gavin, or if I choose, I can flip my vote and work with Devens and Wardog  to vote for Aurora and she would go home. That's a tough one. <br/>Ron, you want another coconut? <br/>Thank you. <br/>With Rick winning immunity, I'm the biggest threat you can  vote out right now. If Victoria, Gavin, Julie, and Aurora team up, they can take me  out. So my strategy is to target Aurora, because there's in love lost  taking out Aurora. She runs a big mouth, and she's on the bottom. <br/>Not good for him to win immunity for us. <br/>It's not. If we don't work together. I'm out and you're out and neither one of us get. There we go with Aurora now. Let's do it. <br/>Solid. <br/>Okay. <br/>What do you want to do? <br/>Take out Aurora. <br/>Take out Aurora? <br/>Yes. <br/>Why wouldn't you do this when I said this? <br/>We can do it now. I talked with Ron. <br/>I mean, why should I believe you after the last vote? <br/>Well, the last vote, you were closer to Kelley than I was. You would have told Kelley. I couldn't tell you. That makes sense, right? <br/>So take out Aurora? <br/>Yeah. If people are playing smart, they go after Wardog, but I'm  banking on stupidity tonight. <br/>I think my dad is going to be so impressed with my fire  skills. I don't trust Wardog, but maybe his plan will work. It makes sense for my game. I have been pushing for Aurora to get voted out of this game  forever. Maybe I could have a conversation with Lauren. <br/>Wardog told me I was right all along, Aurora should go  home, and you and me and Rick and Ron take out Aurora. I want to make sure we shouldn't take Wardog out first. <br/>At least I mow the devil we're working with when we're  working with Wardog. <br/>Right. <br/>I think we still take out Aurora, then we are left with  the two of us and Wardog. <br/>I don't know. I have to think about it. <br/>Oh, my God. The group wants the take out Wardog. I would love revenge for Kelley, but I don't know if that's the  best thing for me and my game. I'm trying not to be emotional about it, but I'm really nervous. It's getting to the point now, if I don't look to the future, if  I don't set up my alliance, if I don't get my ducks in a row, then I won't  have a future. <br/>I know you've been having a lot of people pulling you  aside and things like that. <br/>It was Wardog talking and me listening. I'm tired of wondering who I can really trust. <br/>You can trust me. I mean, I feel like I tried to show you the trust. The biggest thing I had, by giving you that. You didn't have to hand it back. <br/>I don't even question your trust. <br/>We are all threats in this game. There's definitely concern that Ron could be working with Wardog  and Rick. Ron is the one that is playing both sides, and he's done nothing  but lie to me in this game. My advantage is an extra vote. And that definitely could come in handy, especially because Wardog  and Rick are not talking to me. The only other time this happened is when my name is being  written down. And that never feels good. And you would be crazy to say that you feel comfortable, because  if you do, you're going home. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. So, Wardog, what is the temperature become at camp? Is it friendly? Has it shifted? Do you sense paranoia? <br/>Yeah, as numbers get down, there's less people you can  point a finger at. Since everybody talks to everybody, it gets really thick in the  weeds out there. So I didn't realize it, but as it gets smaller, the game gets  much harder, even though there are less pieces to move around. <br/>Gaving, it looks like you had a reaction. <br/>Yeah, Wardog is saying everyone is talking to everyone,  but we haven't spoken since the Wentworth vote. <br/>After the comment he made a comment that I didn't like too  much. He had the audacity to say, oh, if I had known you had the  numbers, I would have been along. If I had known. <br/>There are two different ways to approach it. There's talking to someone, but I feel like Wardog was talking  at me. I think that's the reason we haven't spoken since. <br/>Go, Gavin. <br/>Jeff: Devens, you could make a case that every tribal can  be a turning point in that there is no way to stop that ball that's rolling  down the hill, which is great if you're the one pushing, not so good if  you're the one that's about to roll over. <br/>Absolutely. The last returning player was voted out last tribal. The last several players have been really big targets. You do look around and go, which side of the ball am I on? Am I call up in this, or am I pushing? Every step is precarious right now. <br/>Jeff: Wardog, do you agree it's been a lot of big targets  that are now on the jury? <br/>Absolutely. Since the merge everyone is a big target. <br/>Jeff: Does that concern you? <br/>Absolutely. I feel like my target has grown a lot. First I've had to battle for 13 days with David. And then Wentworth, I felt like she was preparing an end game  that didn't include me, so myself and Ron put her out of the game. So I got a big target. <br/>Jeff: Wow, Ron, very clever move like Wardog just put you  in that cage right with him. <br/>Truthful. I was parted of it. You have to look around and see who the threats are and decide  when to make the move to remove them from this game. <br/>Jeff: Victoria, very interesting what's happening tonight,  people are working jury. One way you work a jury is by saying, I'm the one that played  you, so remember that when I'm in the end, as though that is a badge of  honor, which it can be. <br/>I think it really depends on the kind of jury you have if  that works or not. Like Wardog said and Ron said, the big targets right now are the  threats in the game, so if you start bragging, hey, I got this person, this  person, this person out, look how great I am, your tribe could find you as a  threat, but if you don't start talking about it soon, the jury might not  respect you. So Gavin, three people now, Wardog, Ron, and Victoria all say,  yeah, the far -- targets are the ones who are the biggest threats. <br/>That's the reason every one of those people are sitting  over. There they were a threat. I think people saw them as winning this game. That's why they're over there and some of us are still over  here. <br/>Jeff: Aurora, if we did an anonymous survey, would  everybody agree who the threats are in this group of eight? <br/>Absolutely not. I think everything in this game is about perception. Each day it changes, and it's going to continue to change. The game is nowhere near over, and there is no one threat. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, how about for you? Is there a consensus among this eight who the real threats are? <br/>It depends on who you want to sit with at the end. Who I perceive as a threat Julie might not see as a threat. It's really gray. <br/>Jeff: Devens, what do you do to make sure you get out the  people you think are a threat, even though that may not line up with what  everybody else thinks? <br/>That's what's so precarious about the game. Every opportunity a setback, and every setback is an  opportunity. The last two tribals I fell like I needed to win to stay safe,  but every time you win, you think, oh, no, am I too much of a threat now. I feel like we're all queuing around camp like Julie is caesar. Everywhere we turn, there is a knife and what's up, man? Want to get some water. It's a scary time around camp. <br/>Jeff: Ron, you sort of relish that idea that it could be  everybody has a knife and everybody knows everybody has a knife? <br/>I don't like that actually. That's why I try to find people who I can trust. I don't want to get the et tu, brute in my back. I'm looking for true relationships, true people I can go to the  end with and that we're solid. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, the iRony of having a relationship you can  trust is that everybody in that group believes they're the one that will win. <br/>Yeah, if you tell me, you know, I want to go to the end  with you, then there is part of you that thinks you can beat me. And if you think you can beat me, what am I missing? I think that's a very complicated relationship to balance. <br/>Jeff: Aurora, that's a narrow balance beam the walk, what Lauren  just described. <br/>That's perfectly right. At this point I am used to things being up in the air. I think we all feel as though our plan is going forward, and I  think some people are going to be surprised by the end of the night. <br/>Jeff: Okay. It is time to vote. Victoria, you're up. <br/>See you later. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. The anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. First vote, Aurora. Wardog. Aurora. That's two votes Aurora. Wardog. We're tied. Two votes Wardog, two votes Aurora. Wardog. That's three votes Wardog. That's four votes Wardog, two votes Aurora. 12th person voted out and the ninth member of our jury, Wardog. That's five, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Wardog, the tribe has spoken. <br/>You all made the right decision. Good luck. Love you. <br/>Love you, Wardog. <br/>Thank you, brother. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. Access.Wgbh.Org  Jeff: Next time on "Survivor," in a game of  manipulation --  It's a secret advantage. I'm going to give it to you. <br/>It's expired. He doesn't need to know that. <br/>Jeff: You can't trust anyone. <br/>Why you looking in my bag? <br/>Jeff: Except family. Challenge is good to go. All we're missing are the loved ones. <br/>Ultimately it came down to Ron tonight. Ron did well, because I would have voted me out, too. So I'm at the Edge of Extinction right now. Don't know how long I'll be here, but I I can handle it. Regrets happen. Every day you're here you're closer to winning the game. <br/>Listen, dude, you can bet your rear end you're going to  get it from me tomorrow, just so you know.
