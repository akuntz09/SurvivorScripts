<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: On a remote island off the coast of  Fiji, 19 Americans were marooned with no instructions. <br/>We don't have a pot, we don't have water, we don't have anything, and none of  us have a clue what's going on. <br/>Come on, we've got visitors! <br/>Probst: Then a message from above quickly changed everything. <br/>"Welcome, survivors. Construct the best possible living area you can."  Holy cow, man! <br/>All right! <br/>Probst: With an unprecedented abundance of supplies...  Let's rock and roll. <br/>Probst: ...the castaways begin to build the most elaborate camp in Survivor  history. <br/>The kitchen's going to be right there. <br/>Probst: Sylvia the architect spearheaded the construction effort. <br/>Hey, I notice nobody's working on the kitchen. We need a crew for the kitchen or else it won't be done until tomorrow. <br/>I do get the sense that Sylvia's trying to dominate. You're going to upset the wagon by doing that. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, Sylvia's leadership earned her the right  to divide the tribes. Moto, you are green. Ravu, you are orange. <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>Probst: Then Sylvia learned she had immunity, but would be banished to Exile  Island. You will rejoin this game by joining the tribe that does lose a member. Exile Island awaits. The stage was set for a high[1]stakes  challenge. In addition to immunity, the winning tribe gets to stay on the beach that all  19 of you put blood, sweat, and tears into building. Losers will go to a new beach where you will find one pot and one machete,  and that's it. Go! During the challenge... Jessica still working on the pieces. ...Jessica slowed Ravu down. Moto has their knife! And Moto came out ahead. Moto wins immunity and reward! Ravu, here's a map to your new beach. Not much waiting for you. On Exile Island...  "Here you won't find the idol you crave."  Probst: Sylvia discovered that the hidden idol was back at her tribe camp. <br/>Now I have to figure out a time when I can search for it without prying eyes. <br/>We're home! <br/>Probst: And Ravu landed on a new beach. <br/>We've got a double whammy. We have to start over, a new shelter, but now we've got to figure out a team  member to lose. <br/>Probst: And at tribal council... First person voted out of Survivor:  Fiji,Jessica. ...the tribe singled out Jessica as the weak link. as the weak link. Jessica, the tribe has spoken. Jessica, the tribe has spoken. 18 are left. 18 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>The leaves have water on them. them. Water! Water! <br/>Tree licking good. <br/>This is the weirdest thing I've ever done. But it's good. I think I'm going to grab a couple of more. <br/>It's like tree hugging. <br/>Let's go. <br/>So it's day four on the island, and we're dehydrated. We're so desperate for water that we found that there's trickle bits of water  on leaves, and so just licking the leaves and getting as much water as  possible, we thought that would be a good idea. <br/>Oh, no! <br/>Seriously, just lick some leaves, man. The palms are better. <br/>I've never... have you ever licked a leaf before? <br/>We need to survive. It's hard to even think when you're dying of starvation and thirst. thirst. Thirst before anything. Thirst before anything. <br/>You missed one. <br/>It's just a little bit of dirt. <br/>We're all just dehydrated. It makes you delirious. <br/>Lick it. <br/>Lick it. <br/>So good. <br/>So good. <br/>How did you guys sleep? <br/>I slept really well last night. The pillows really make a difference. It's ridiculous. <br/>We are very fortunate to be living the way that we're living. Yesterday we did win one hell of a reward. [ scat singing] âª We are in an island. [ scat singing] [ laughter]  We do have a really plush couch, beautiful pillows that we could sleep on. There's two hammocks. You know, we have silverware, plates. We're all more than happy. We're all sitting around thinking the same thing-- this game is so vicious,  it's delicious. I just killed an ant with a hammer. [ laughing] What a great death. <br/>Yeah, man. It's rough out here. Belly full of salted rice, fresh mangoes, lemonade. <br/>There's some more rice in  There's some more rice in here. here. <br/>Of course, we made it ourselves. The fat of the land. [ farting sound]  Oh, my god! Boo! Oh, for the love of Pete. <br/>That's air. It's not like a sea urchin. <br/>Still! <br/>We're already full. You know, this is going to be the first Survivorwhere you actually gain  weight when you actually gain weight when you come. come. <br/>We have a lot to do over there. A nice, long, groove. See, that's what we need. <br/>Come on! <br/>It's tiring. It's very tiring. <br/>It is. <br/>It's going to take a long time to do. Do you want to take a break? <br/>Go, go, go, go, go. <br/>Right now, Ravu is in pretty bad shape. We've got heart for days, but heart doesn't do any good when you're as thirsty  and hungry as we are. We rub sticks and we rub more sticks. Rubbing sticks is great if you have 30 people who are all hydrated and have  energy. When you have eight people who are tired as hell and who have no water in  their system, it no water in their system, it burns you out pretty fast. burns you out pretty fast. <br/>So since we did not get any fire yet and weren't able to boil water, the plan  here is to fill up as many canisters as we can with coconut water. With a good knife, it takes about a minute to crack open a coconut. With a bad knife it takes, like, three, four, minutes. I mean, that really takes a lot more energy. <br/>I think I can get one open in  I think I can get one open in one minute. one minute. What's that, 30 seconds? <br/>Ooh! A little cocky, are we, buddy? I didn't know we had a competition. <br/>Let's get the stopwatch out. <br/>Trying to take your title, there. there. <br/>They are completely full. <br/>They are completely full. <br/>Are you kidding me? Nothing! <br/>Today, what's going on is basically everyone's beat. Nobody really has the energy to chop anything open or run around, so you,  like, chop up five coconuts, take a nap for an hour. I'm telling you, right now, nobody has a clue. We're walking around into the rocks and the trees, guy. Half of us can't even stand up for more than, like, an hour and a half, I'm  telling you. I just... you know, I've never experienced dehydration like this so much. You guys want this, or what? <br/>Rocky, just swallow it. <br/>Yeah? I was eating clams off the ground. I don't do that! I eat clams, too. I don't eat them off the ground. Huh? No! It's crazy! It's crazy! We're starving here, bro! We're starving here, bro! <br/>On the stick? <br/>On the sign. <br/>Man, you'd better get some water into that. <br/>Boo caught something in his eye, and his eye's red. He's got an obvious indentation in his eye. Just blink with your eye as I'm pouring it in. Try to go as long as you can. Just blink. Just keep it, keep it. It's going to be bad. It's going to be annoying. Just keep it. Just keep it. All right. All right. <br/>Look how he dropped that ax so close to his leg. so close to his leg. <br/>Oh, my god, Boo, be careful. <br/>Oh, my god, Boo, be careful. <br/>Oops. <br/>Oops. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Oh, my god, Boo, how did it happen? <br/>Hang on. <br/>I just barely finished helping him with the eye situation, and the next thing  you know, he takes an ax, and literally the ax went through the finger and  right down to the knee. <br/>Quit worrying about my injury. <br/>We aren't worrying about your injury. <br/>We have other stuff we need to do. <br/>Like what? <br/>I will tell y'all when I think I need some help. <br/>It's too late then, Boo. Boo is very stubborn. He's a real hazard to himself. I can see it happening where we don't have to vote nobody out sooner or later. For real, he has one leg, one hand, and one eye. He really ain't no good to us now. What can we do? We've got to think about that kind of stuff. That's the kind of stuff I'll be thinking about, you know what I'm saying? Everybody knows it. Everybody is predicting it. Boo will hurt himself out of the Boo will hurt himself out of the game. game. <br/>Darn it, Boo! <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Had to happen to me. <br/>Had to happen to me. <br/>Sylvia. <br/>Is she here? <br/>Yeah. Yeah, there she is. Come on, you guys. <br/>Hey, Anthony! What are you guys called again? <br/>Ravu. <br/>Ravu! I knew it was going to be good. Did you guys make a home? <br/>Huh? <br/>Did you make a home or are you waiting for me? <br/>We waited for you. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Oh, my god, it was horrible. Hi! I was... I was hoping... I was hoping I would be on your team. <br/>Welcome home! When Sylvia came back from Exile Island, everybody was excited. But when I went up to greet her, I had only one thing in my mind, and that  was to see if she found the immunity idol. So when I was giving her a hug I was actually quite nasty. I looked over her shoulder and opened up her shoulder bag and did a little  quick search, and I didn't find anything. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>That was my first thought in mind-- "When I'm hugging her, I'm going to  feel her up and see if the idol is there."  I made fire for the first time in my life. There's no flint here? <br/>No, we had no fire here. <br/>We've got nothing. <br/>We don't have water. <br/>So when I got here and they told me they had no fire and no water at all, you  know, you're just kind of like, "We're stuck in a really bad  situation." So how many canteens do we have filled yet? <br/>None. <br/>We're just starting the process. Okay. Isn't that awesome? <br/>Here. I'll try it, Erica. Okay, so...  You need to give it a good whack. Here, over the... so you drip...  Hey, it ain't working for me, guys. <br/>Harder. Just hit hard. <br/>I am! I feel like at this point I'm a bit extraneous. I'm a bit like... because I missed the whole day with them, and they've got  the whole rhythm going, so I feel like I'm coming in and trying to help, but  I'm not...  Oh, man. <br/>... you know, part of the core right now. If the sun gets intense for long enough, you might get something there. It looks like your left hand could use a little support. Could you? Um...  Michelle. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I was not really excited for Sylvia to come back. I already didn't have great feelings about her personality. I personally think she's a little bossy, and just likes to push people around. <br/>How about fishing along the shore? <br/>We can try it. <br/>You know, if this is low tide, we ought to go out and get some oysters. <br/>In many ways, Sylvia's the outsider. She kind of does rub people the wrong way. I mean, it's not so much that she's a bad person. It's just that she's... for lack It's just that she's... for lack of a better  word, she's bossy. of a better word, she's bossy. <br/>Yep. If I throw the machete, are you If I throw the machete, are you going to catch  it? going to catch it? <br/>There you go. <br/>Being on Survivoris pretty much a little bit easier than being homeless. Hey, watch out! Look, I'm going to bring down a family of them. <br/>Oh, that was a good one, buddy. You got six out of that. <br/>When I was first homeless, I was about seven years old because my momma  started doing drugs. <br/>I wouldn't step on that one for too much security. <br/>Our momma was a crackhead. And my brothers and sisters and I decided all we got is each other and  ourselves. And so we used to just get the food out of the trash can that people throw  away. It's very similar, having to go out and get food, having to find food. And when you find food you ain't going to be greedy and eat it yourself  because you're hungry, because you know everybody else is hungry, too. <br/>That's beautiful. That's a beautiful thing. <br/>There's so much more, there are so many more. The more trees we find, the more we run wild. I know my teammates don't know what it's like to suffer. When I first got here, I was like, "What are these people doing  here?" I don't think they know what it's like to struggle. I think this is the most struggle some people had that's here, which is not  really even a struggle to me. This is easier than being homeless on the street. I know people are going to be jealous. People sitting at home, they're going to be jealous, because we've got more  food here than they have in their refrigerator. <br/>Oh, wow. That would be sad. <br/>Yeah, that would be really sad. <br/>This is more food that I've got in my refrigerator. <br/>I have a weight of responsibility to last in this game, because I do want to  help my family. I'm in an amazing spot in my life right now. I'm going to help my family when I'm going to help my family when I get back. I get back. <br/>Ahoy! I am beyond starving. I'm looking for anything, any tree of life, anything. <br/>Look on the ground, man. <br/>Hey, this is something. Are those nuts? <br/>Mango, bro. <br/>Yeah, it's a mango. This is definitely the beginning stages. Can't eat them. I'm going to go up here a little I'm going to go up here a little bit more  and see. bit more and see. We went all the way up to the top, around, nothing. I went all the way up that way. There's no other fruit here. There's no other fruit here. Nothing. Nothing. <br/>Oh, my god. Pineapples. There are so many of them. Hey! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Pineapples. This is ready. <br/>Pineapple! <br/>We're running around hungry and stupid for the past few days. We've been looking over there. <br/>Amazing! <br/>Beautiful! <br/>We've been trekking the whole island, climbing mountains and stuff, and right  in front of us has been, like, hundreds of pineapples, sitting there. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Erica, you're the hero. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>No way! <br/>Oh, sweet! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>We've got pineapple power for the challenge tomorrow. <br/>This is huge. This is... now I'll be ready. I'll be ready. Wow, a miracle. And she just stumbled on to it. Me and Erica, we're getting married now. She just saved my life. And I appreciate that. That's a good woman. <br/>I just want to smile. <br/>I just want to smile. I just want to smile. I just want to smile. <br/>Yo! <br/>Hey! <br/>What is that thing? <br/>Tree mail? <br/>Bring it here. <br/>Is that fire? <br/>We got mail. <br/>No. No fire, stupid. He goes, "Fire?" Yeah, I got fire right here, buddy. "Run, paddle, pull, think. This one's anybody's game. Teamwork and the will to win..."  We've got the will! We've got the will! <br/>That's right. ..."helps with food and saves your flame."  Key word, "flame," baby. We've got fire. <br/>We've got flint. We've got heart. <br/>I am not going to have any problems kicking butt today. It's definitely all about payback today. I mean, we helped build that shelter. We wasted all of our fresh energy on making that camp home. So today is the day that we can get back at them and we can make them suffer  a little bit. <br/>Ow! <br/>I want to win for many reasons. I'm the most vulnerable member of the tribe right now, having been an  outsider, and I've realized for a couple of days now, of course, that the  immunity idol is here at camp. But I haven't had the strength, the energy, or really opportunity to go look  for it. So there is no option for me to lose. lose. Because I know the consequences. Because I know the consequences. <br/>I hope y'all feel that nervousness coming on. It's time. It's go-home day. It's go-home day for somebody. Somebody got to go home today. And we don't plan on it being us. It's go-home day, and we want to stay on go-home day. <br/>Y'all doing it, I'm going it. It's definitely game on, and we're pumped. We're pumped in more ways than they can imagine. Our tribe has a distinct advantage. It's a huge advantage where we've been fed, we've been happy, we've been  cracking up laughing, we've been sleeping well. We're going to be calm. We're going to be steady. They're going to be nervous. We don't want to lose, but we know in our minds we're not starting from the  bottom starting from the bottom anymore. anymore. anymore. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Moto, getting your first look at the new Ravu tribe. Jessica voted out at the first tribal council. Sylvia has taken her spot. First order of business. Sylvia, your buff. You're now official. You're now official. <br/>Finally. <br/>Finally. <br/>Probst: All right, first things first. things first. Take back immunity. Take back immunity. Immunity, back up for grabs. For today's challenge, each tribe will paddle in a canoe out and around your  tribe flag. On your way back, you must collect four supply crates. Each time you paddle over a crate, one tribe member will attach a long rope  to the crate. Once you're back to shore, you'll pull the crates in and carry them to your  tribe mat. When you have all four crates on your mat, you'll untie them to find six  puzzle pole pieces and a flag. The first tribe to correctly assemble their puzzle pole with their flag and  raise it wins the challenge. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: A lot of fishing gear. <br/>Nice. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Probst: Ravu, because you still do not have fire, you're still playing for  fire in the form of flint. <br/>Let's get it, baby. <br/>Probst: Talk about making a change. It would be nice to have some water, wouldn't it? <br/>Yes, it would. <br/>Probst: And the most important thing in this game, immunity. In addition, the winning tribe will choose one member from the losing tribe  to go to Exile Island. There is a lot at stake, winner take all. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Give you a minute to  Probst: Give you a minute to strategize, we'll get started. strategize, we'll get started. Here we go. Ravu looking for some revenge. Moto looking to put them deeper in the hole. For reward and immunity, survivors ready? survivors ready? Go! Go! Got to go out past your flag and then head back! <br/>Row! Row! Row! Dig deep, you guys! <br/>All right, you guys, reverse it, reverse it. <br/>Start backpedaling. <br/>Start backpedaling. <br/>Go backwards. <br/>Go backwards. <br/>Probst: Ravu makes the turn. Moto makes the turn. Both tribes dead even as they pass their flag heading back. Rain starting to come down. Ravu right on line. <br/>Say when, say when. <br/>Probst: Michelle clips in for Ravu. <br/>Push! Push! <br/>Probst: Stacy clips in for Moto. <br/>Don't stop! Don't stop! <br/>Row! <br/>Probst: Ravu with a bit of a lead. Ravu clipped into their second crate. <br/>Go! <br/>Push, push! <br/>Stop, stop, stop! <br/>Get it out of the boat! <br/>Probst: Moto's rope is tangled. They're losing time. Ravu getting a big break. <br/>Hurry! Come on! <br/>Probst: Moto has their second crate. Michelle clips in for Ravu, extending the lead. <br/>Backpedal here. Backpedal! Backpedal! <br/>You guys, keep it going. <br/>Probst: Michelle has clipped in the fourth and final crate for Ravu. They're heading back to shore. <br/>Let's go! <br/>Stacy clips in with the third crate for Moto  Untangle that rope. Come on, let's go! <br/>Probst: Moto clipping into their fourth crate.

Ravu, more bad news for you. Somebody's going to be going to Exile Island. The only saving grace is that whoever Moto chooses will be safe from tribal  council tonight. Moto, give me your decision. <br/>It's Earl. <br/>Probst: Okay, Earl. Boat's waiting for you. You will get another clue to the whereabouts of a hidden immunity idol. Watch out for the sea snakes. <br/>I'll eat them. <br/>Probst: Ravu, tonight you lose another member to tribal council. You have the afternoon to figure out who that's going to be. Grab your stuff, head on back to Grab your stuff, head on back to camp. camp. <br/>"Here you won't find the idol you crave. Search back at your camp if you hope to be saved." Clue number two:  "To search with success you must become centered under the highest point  upon which you have entered." Back at the camp where I just left? Wow! To find out that the idol was back at camp was very shocking. But it doesn't really matter that Sylvia has that first clue, because as of  tonight, she most because as of tonight, she most likely will be gone. likely will be gone. Exile is an upgrade from how we were living. For one, I have fire. But at the same time, I'm not involved on what's going on at involved on  what's going on at the camp. the camp. There's a freaking snake. There's a freaking snake. The highly poisonous sea snake. The highly poisonous sea snake. Can't take that chance. Can't take that chance. That same one. It's like Saving Private Ryan. If you let that one go, it might come back and get you later. Sorry, buddy. I really don't like killing animals. Snakes are misunderstood. But we have an understanding But we have an understanding now. now. <br/>That one was a tough loss, guys. Just wait till the challenges when there aren't no puzzles. We'll kill everybody, you know what I mean? <br/>I love you. <br/>It's the puzzles that kick our ass every time, bro, every time. <br/>Here we are, we bust our asses today, and what do we got? Nothing. Empty-handed. You know, we can't even win with the sun. And now we've got to go to tribal council again. And that's just frustrating. I'm just mad. I'm mad and a whole lot tired, and it's only day six. It's only day six! I just want some freaking water, I just want some freaking water, that's all. that's all. <br/>I'd say Erica panicked today. You know, she was kind of grumpy and screaming, which is all right, because  we always... you know, lot of us are. But not at the challenges, you know? She's screaming, she's yelling at people about pieces, this and that, when it  wasn't even her that, when it wasn't even her place to be there. place to be there. <br/>Mookie's probably going to be my partner in crime, you know. We pretty much made an alliance, and that way we can manipulate everybody and  just get it done. I know it sounds bad, bro, but what am I going to do? What am I going to do? All right, come up here so I can talk to you. Come on. Come on. So we're switching it out, bro. <br/>Oh, we're switching it out? <br/>Yeah. So Erica is going to go now, and if and when the next time we lose, Sylvia  goes next. <br/>Wouldn't you rather get rid of Sylvia now? <br/>No, no, because Erica is the threat. Sylvia is not. <br/>Yeah, but we've got to get... we need the strength is the thing. <br/>To be honest with you, I love her to death, but I can't always read her. I don't always know where she's coming from. <br/>So you'd rather have Sylvia here? <br/>No, Sylvia is next. <br/>But we need to take out Erica. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>She broke down today. She... when we had those poles in, when it didn't work, we should have taken  it out, she's like, "No, do it again."  Mookie said "We're going to vote Erica off." I said,  "Whoa!"  Things change real quick. <br/>Yeah, they do. <br/>Gee, I thought my days were numbered here. Bye. If you have laundry, just bring it to us. And the one thing I learned, if nothing else, is when you're in a situation  like this, a survival situation, rule number one-- you keep your head. She was panicking and screaming in my ear. <br/>Explain to him, because he's upset about it, and I don't blame him. <br/>She was completely in a panic. You have to stay calm as a team. When one person's yelling and screaming, we're all distracted. <br/>It's nothing personal, bro. <br/>It's just performance. <br/>I know it's not personal. I know it's not personal. <br/>I'm telling you. <br/>Do you want to keep losing or no? It's up to you. <br/>Dude, do I look like I want to keep losing? <br/>I'm just asking you, bro. <br/>Do you want to ask me that question again? <br/>Do you want to keep losing? Don't get all mad at me, brother. <br/>I'm not getting mad at you. <br/>You're bickering with me for no reason. <br/>I'm not bickering with you. Dude, I'm not bickering. <br/>Okay. <br/>You're upset, guy. <br/>I'm upset at the whole situation. <br/>Who would you rather it be? <br/>I'm upset about the whole situation, man. situation, man. This sucks. This sucks. <br/>You know, Erica lost her top. She completely blew her stack at the challenge today. And because she panicked, everybody saw it. And those who didn't trust her a lot now just want her gone, which in many  ways I think is a mistake for the tribe. I don't think it's smart. I don't think it's smart. <br/>No, I don't think so, either, but then.... <br/>Right, it's the majority. <br/>It's the majority. <br/>Okay, well...  They've got the votes. They've got the votes. <br/>They have enough already? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Well, if they have enough already, let me put Sylvia, so I can be like,  "I'm voting you because I don't like you."  Okay, then that's cool. Then I'll vote for Sylvia, too. I'm playing the game. So is everybody else. You just have to play with what cards you're dealt. And right now I've got a really funky hand. Getting rid of Sylvia in a lot of ways would probably be good, you know,  mental health for all of us. We were all fine before she showed up. We were actually all pretty tight before she showed up. <br/>Here's my question. How did you feel before she got here and after she got here? <br/>It was just kind of weird when she got here. <br/>That's what I mean. How did you feel before? <br/>I was cool. <br/>I thought before we were...  We were all good with who we had, you know? <br/>I mean, I feel like we have the right combination between the girls and the  guys that we have to make it through. <br/>Well, if we keep it together and if you and I keep together, then we'll be  good. So we'll do it, and we'll... So we'll do it, and we'll...  Okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>We get all the bad luck for losing, huh? <br/>Any more? <br/>If we landed in Bizarro World and we end up with a split vote of four for  Erica and four for Sylvia, I think a couple of people's heads would explode. That would be a whole lot of people who have been lying to a whole lot of  other people who are already lying to a whole lot of other people.

I'm just hoping that we're not in Bizarro World, and everybody keeps up with  what they're planning to do, because, you know, in this game, you can't know,  in this game, you can't take anything at face value. take anything at face value. <br/>Probst: Mookie, back-to-back losses in winner-take-all challenges. How big of a hole is this tribe in right now? <br/>We're in a deep hole. We still have no fire, which means no water. We're running out of coconuts. We're tired. We're in a hole. We need to win. <br/>Probst: Anthony, what do you think went wrong in today's challenge? <br/>I think there was too many people trying to help out in things where they  should have backed off and let the original people who we thought were going  to take care of it take care of it. <br/>Probst: What I saw today, Erica, was you at one point screaming, "It  goes like this! It goes like this!" Can that be an interference? <br/>A lot of people tried a lot of different pieces, and I was really trying to  help out, give some input. I'm passionate about my team. I'm passionate about winning. And I feel like putting my input in wasn't such a bad thing, and all I asked  them to do was to go back and try it again. <br/>Probst: Sylvia, you divide these tribes, then you leave. You come back. Did you feel welcomed? <br/>Actually, I felt kind of like an outsider. They had the challenge itself, and then going back to camp, putting it  together, and then having to come here, and that's a lot of bonding. So by the time I showed up, I felt I was on the outside. <br/>Probst: Rocky, what was your reaction to Sylvia coming back and joining the  tribe? <br/>Sylvia is used to leading. She's used to, you know, dictating and telling people what to do. But whatever she tries to put across, she's doing it in a positive way. <br/>Probst: Anthony, is what Rocky said true? Is Sylvia more of a leader? <br/>Bless you, Sylvia. You have a wonderful habit of kind of throwing out an idea and saying,  "Let's do it," and not actually talking with anybody about doing it. <br/>Probst: So, again, Sylvia, people are saying you're somewhat of a leader. Is this surprising to you? <br/>A little, because I came in late. So I could not be the leader just walking in off Exile Island and say,  "Okay, everybody, clear the way. I'm leader." But I can offer ideas. An idea that's been gurgling in my head, which I haven't brought up to  everybody, but tomorrow when we're fresh, when we wake up, is to assign a  leader. <br/>Probst: So Yau-Man, last tribal council it was "Let's get rid of the  weakest member, make our tribe stronger." What's the criteria this time  for voting somebody out? <br/>The criteria this time I think is to have a more cohesive tribe, to form a  tribe where we get along better and be open to discussion and get rid of  someone who is too vocal or too stubborn, who is too arrogant about things. <br/>Probst: Okay, before we get to the vote, here are the rules about the hidden  immunity idol. It is good through the final five. If you decide to play it, you will do so after the votes have been cast, but  before I read them. You can also give it to someone else at that point. If the person who uses the idol does in fact have the highest number of  votes, then the person with the next highest number of votes would be sent  home. Okay, it is time to vote. Okay, it is time to vote. Erica, you're up. Erica, you're up. <br/>I just can't read you anymore. And quite frankly you're the biggest threat right now. biggest threat right now. Sorry, baby.

I'm sorry. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. <br/>Probst: If anyone has the idol and wants to play it, now is the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote, Erica.

Once again, you will be going back to camp without fire. Grab your stuff. Head on out. Head on out. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: stay tuned for scenes  Probst: stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time  Probst: Next time on Survivor: on Survivor: Sylvia digs for immunity. <br/>I'm pretty sure I know where the idol is. <br/>Whoa! <br/>Probst: Ravu sparks a flame. <br/>We're not going to die! <br/>We finally got the shot in the ass we needed. <br/>Probst: And a Moto member is in trouble. <br/>He can't breathe. He was afraid. He said he didn't want to die in He said he didn't want to die in Fiji. Fiji. <br/>I was very, very shocked by the vote tonight. It kind of hurts to get blindsided like that. I don't think it was a smart move to vote off somebody who was strong. When the next challenge comes around, I hope you guys win, but if you don't,  I want you to think about voting me off and think about who you kept. And if you go home empty-handed maybe you should think about the maybe you  should think about the decision that you made.
