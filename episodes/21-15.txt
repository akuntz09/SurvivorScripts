<br/> Jeff: Previously on  "Survivor": Jane, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Y'all have fun. <br/>Jeff: On day 36, when  Jane was voted out, there were only five left in the game, but back on day  one... Welcome to "Survivor: Nicaragua." no one would have  predicted that Dan, Fabio, Sash, Holly, or Chase would have gone so far. They've all followed an improbable path to the end. Dan stepped into the hostile Nicaraguan rain forest wearing $1,600 shoes and  having no idea what he was getting into. Three seconds in... Dan is out of the challenge. During the challenges, he was either ineffective or didn't participate at all. <br/>This tribe might  think I'm a weak link, but I don't consider myself a weak link. <br/>Jeff: But he's the  only one left who hasn't made any enemies. And he's well-liked by everyone on the jury. <br/>Dan is hilarious. To me he's like an old wise guy. <br/>Jeff: Holly's trip to  the final five was also extremely improbable. Holly, I'm not so sure that everybody is as comfortable as they were when we  started. Are you? <br/>No. <br/>Jeff: Holly was even  more uncomfortable back on day five when she completely flipped out and stole  Dan's shoes. <br/>The new york city  boy, Danny, he doesn't like sand on him, so let's just fill his shoes up. <br/>Jeff: Later when she  tried to quit... I can't do it. <br/>Jeff: ...A pep talk  from coach jimmie johnson completely turned her game around. <br/>We really do need you. <br/>Jeff: And by day 27,  she had become the Godmother of her tribe and pulled off a successful hit on Brenda  who at the time was the most strategic player in the game. <br/>We're all in  consensus that Brenda has to go first. She's the ringleader. <br/>Jeff: At the last  tribal council, Chase got into hot water when he revealed his final three  alliance. To be clear, there is a three-person alliance. It is Chase, it is Holly, and it is Sash. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: But his  alliances aren't always what they seem. Since day three, every person Chase had ever aligned with... Without me and you, I  think they're screwed. <br/>There's no reason for  me to backstab you. <br/>Jeff: ...He  eventually voted out. <br/>Sorry, dude. This isn't what I wanted at all. I wish this wouldn't have happened. <br/>Jeff: Chase had  angered so many people... By God, I started it. I put it out. <br/>Jeff: ...That it was  a wonder he was still in the game. At the last tribal council, Chase and Sash were safe because they both had  hidden immunity idols. Thank you. Sash had come a long way since day 28 when he was a dead man walking. <br/>I find myself faced  with an uphill struggle to try to get to the end. <br/>Jeff: His allies, NaOnka  and Purple Kelly, quit. Head out. So he was aligned with no one. <br/>I'm kind of like a  free agent. I'd like to work with whoever had me in their plans. <br/>Jeff: But he made  secret side deals with everyone to go to the end. <br/>Would you swear that  you will take me no matter what? <br/>Yes. <br/>I hold more chips  than anyone still remaining. <br/>Jeff: And now he's  back in contention. Let me ask the question. Who's next? <br/>Whoever doesn't win  immunity next. <br/>It sounds like if I  don't win again I could be going next. <br/>The writing is on the  wall, Fabio. <br/>Jeff: Right now, no  one is in a deeper hole than Fabio. Back on day one, Fabio was dismissed as a goofball. The guy with the long, blond hair, he's a dumb blond. You know, I never really called a guy a dumb blond before, but he's a dumb  blond. <br/>My strategy to be out  in the open and make people laugh and to be all crazy, I call it being cool. <br/>Jeff: But when his  life was on the line, he won the last immunity challenge. <br/>Fabio thinks he has  it, and he does! Fabio wins immunity! Which proved to everyone that he was a serious player. <br/>I always tell myself  no matter what happens I make the best of the pieces there. <br/>Jeff: Tonight,  everyone's improbable journey will come to an end. Grab your torches; head back to camp. After 36 days of surprises, the biggest are yet to come. One of these five people will outwit, outplay, and outlast all the others to  win the million-dollar prize and the title of sole Survivor. <br/>Day 37. Unbelievable. <br/>After last night's  tribal council, realizing that Sash, Holly, and Chase are pretty tight, you  know, I definitely think it's in my best interest to break them up. I feel like they think I'm the big threat now. They want me out next. That's what I'm saying. <br/>It should be a  no-brainer. <br/>Sorry, Holly, for  being a little bit down, but I'm realizing the way things are lining up, and  I'm not in a good position here. I mean, you, Sash, and Chase seem pretty tight. <br/>It's anybody's game. <br/>Well, you want to go  to the final three with me, or do you want to go with Chase? <br/>I'm very much aware  of the position I'm in and I'll go out fighting. Unless somebody else has a better plan. <br/>So what are you  saying your plan is? <br/>Try to win immunity. I'm not very comfortable going to tribal council without a necklace right now. But I gotta be cool right now. I can't let on that I'm playing the game. Sash, how do you really feel about things? <br/>I really think Dan  and Holly are huge threats. Fabio is definitely a little bit on edge, which he should be. If I was in his shoes, I would be as well. But there's a very good chance Fabio could make an immunity run and go all  the way to the end. So you better believe that I'm telling Fabio what he wants to hear. You know what I want. <br/>But I don't know. I don't know how tight you and Chase really are. <br/>Chase and I are tight. I would like to go to the end with Chase. Just like I'd like to go to the end with you. If you only have one clear-cut strategy in "Survivor," chances are  you're not going to make it all the way to the end. I'm trying to find as many avenues to make final three as possible, so if  that means making promises to every single person left on my tribe, that's  what I'm going to do. <br/>Fabio is extremely  nervous right now, because he thinks that, you know, he's the next to go,  which he is. You know, so the same plan as always, right? <br/>Yeah, yeah. We've got a big challenge coming up, and we're gunning for Fabio. Fabio is a huge physical threat. He can win his way to the end, and he's been winning immunities. He won the last one, and if Fabio loses the next immunity, he's going home  tonight. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yep. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: First things  first, Fabio. Give it up. Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. On my go, you'll race out to a station where you will find a question about Nicaragua. You'll select your answer, choose the corresponding bag and race back. If you're right, the bag will contain puzzle pieces. If you're wrong, the pieces will be black. You'll have to go back and get the right bag. Once you have answered all three questions and collected all three bags of  puzzle pieces, you'll use the pieces to solve the puzzle. First person to get it right wins immunity and will have a one-in-four shot  at the million dollars. We'll draw for spots; we'll get started. All right, here we go, for immunity and a guaranteed spot in the final four. Survivors ready? Go! See what you know about Nicaragua. Everybody working on that first question. Nicaragua shares its southern border with costa rica, its northern border  with what country? Did you study before you came? If you think you know what the answer is, grab that bag and head back. Holly got it right. If you have it right, there are puzzle pieces. Head back out. If you have it wrong, it will be black, and you are wrong. Sash got it right. Fabio got it right. Everybody got the first question right. Honduras is north of Nicaragua. Question number two, "The east coast of Nicaragua is also known as what?"  Holly heading back with her second bag. Chase and Sash heading back with their second bags. Do they have it right? Holly is two for two. Sash got it right. Chase is two for two. Fabio, wrong. Frustrated, tosses his pieces. He's got to head back out. Next question, "In the early 16th century, these people claimed Nicaragua  for spain." Chase and Holly coming back with their third bags. Sash right behind. Fabio racing back. Fabio now back with his second bag, while Chase, Holly, and Sash are all on  their third bags. Holly has it right. She's working on the puzzle. Chase is working on the puzzle. Sash has it right. He's working on the puzzle. Fabio working on that third question. Fabio and Dan way behind. You know what it is. It is the logo from this season. Holly getting there. Sash making a lot of progress. Fabio still working on that third question. Fabio now back with his third bag. Does he have it right? He does. Fabio now working on the puzzle. But he's got to make up a lot of time. Who's going to finish first? Who's going to be guaranteed a spot in the final four? Dan now back with his third bag, and he has it right. Everybody working on their puzzle now. It is Sash with a huge lead right now. Holly trying to get into it. Chase having a hard time. Dan way behind. Fabio making a lot of progress. Fabio was behind, but he has caught up quickly. We've got a race. It is Fabio and Sash right now. Neck and neck. Holly's starting to get into it. Chase still behind. Fabio has made up a lot of time. It is still Fabio and Sash, both very close. Fabio won the last immunity. Can he do it back to back? Sash getting closer. Fabio very close. Fabio has it! Fabio wins immunity! <br/>Nice job, Fabio. <br/>I'm missing a piece. <br/>Ah! <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: Must have fell  out when you dumped them out. Fabio, come on over. <br/>Good job, Fabio. <br/>Good job, Fabio. [applause] Jeff: Once again, Fabio  has immunity. You will live to see the final four. One step closer to the final tribal council. After 37 very tough days, Dan, Chase, Holly, Sash, for one of you, your shot  at the million dollars will come to an end. Going to be an interesting afternoon. I have no doubt. Grab your stuff; head back to camp. I'll see you at tribal. Congrats. <br/>Fabio winning  immunity today definitely put a monkey wrench in our plan. We were hoping that he would lose so we could get rid of him, but tonight I'm  hoping it's an easy vote, and we're going to vote Dan. <br/>Nice job, Fabio. Way to go. <br/>I won again. It was awesome, man. Going into it, I knew that if I didn't win, I was not safe. But I got my necklace, and I'm loving it, man. <br/>Is that what you guys  were expecting for the challenge? <br/>No. <br/>I thought it was  going to be more physical. <br/>I've always known  that I was going to wait to the last minute to be aggressive. I chose to just follow people, go with their plan. But right now, I've got to figure things out and swing them my way, and my  number one plan would be to talk to Chase and Sash to get Holly out first. <br/>He hasn't done  anything. He lays around the shelter all the time. I don't know if people respect him. <br/>I'm not sure  everybody liked him. For me, whoever won it between Fabio and Dan, the other one would go home. That was an easy decision when we got back from camp. Me, personally, I think Dan is less of a threat than Holly, but I've been so  close with her, it would be tough for me to vote out Holly. That would be a tough task. <br/>Chase wants to vote  you. He sees you as a big threat. I don't know where Sash is at with that. <br/>I'm trying, but, you  know... Right. <br/>Sash. I gotta talk to Sash, you know, alone. I want to get Sash to try to vote out Holly. <br/>Three. We need you and Sash. <br/>My job is to paint Holly  as a bigger threat than me. I'd like to convince Sash that we should get rid of Holly. That would be the optimum. It's not going to be easy but that's what I'm going to try and do. <br/>So if that's what you  really want, we can do it in no time. Nobody is going to say "Dan gets the million dollars." everybody  knows I have money. <br/>I'll be honest with  you guys, I can't be any straighter. That's it. I said my piece. <br/>I know. I'm going to have to try to make a case for Dan not being the biggest threat,  and the best person for me to do that with is Sash. I have to have a one-on-one, me and Sash, without Chase coming up and saying,  "What are you guys talking about?" because he does that, and it's  annoying. You personally? Because that could be bad for you, man. <br/>I know. <br/>I'm trying to get a  real sense for how you're feeling. <br/>I know Chase... I  mean, Chase has emotional attachment to Holly. <br/>If Holly and Chase  end up in that final three together, I think they would take all the votes. <br/>You and I could vote Holly  tonight and not even let it come down to Chase. <br/>That's true. Fabio brought up a lot of good points. People are probably giving Dan a little too much credit for being a threat,  but Holly is a threat because she's the only woman left in the game and there  are quite a few women on the jury. Not only that, Holly could get all the votes from all the former Espada  members. <br/>So I'm not trying to  save Dan. I'm just trying to split up Chase and Holly while we can. <br/>I like the idea. You bring up good points. At this point in the game, it's transitioned from an alliance-type game to an  individual game, and everyone is trying to look out for themselves. And I am as well. <br/>We're thinking Dan,  of course. <br/>You're what? <br/>Dan. <br/>We were just thinking  about Dan. <br/>I didn't realize that  you were in for voting him off. I thought... You haven't talked to  me about it. <br/>Yeah, I know, but we  were talking, and I thought my name came up. So that's only thing I was thinking. I have a feeling that Dan and Fabio are telling Sash and Chase that I'm a  huge threat, that they need to get rid of me. Am I concerned at this point? Absolutely. But I just have to trust in my alliance and hope that tonight my name isn't  written down. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring  in the members of our jury. Alina. Marty. Brenda. Naonka. Purple kelly. Benry. And Jane voted out at the last tribal council. Let's talk about today's immunity challenge. Fabio, how big was today's win for you? <br/>Today was a big one,  man. Winning immunity is a huge part of getting to the end of this game. <br/>Jeff: How big a  factor is tonight's vote from the point of "Who can I beat?" Tonight's vote is  going to come down to who people think is the threat for the million because  that's the point of the game we're at. You have to think about who's on the jury? Who has had past relationships with them? Who they maybe respect for certain reasons and who has played a nice game? <br/>Jeff: Dan, a big part  of your strategy from day one has been "Take me to the end. I can't possibly win." Correct. <br/>Jeff: Still feel that  way? <br/>I live a nice life. I have money. And I don't think anybody is going to award me a million dollars, ever. <br/>Jeff: Does that seem  fair to you? <br/>I'm not saying I  couldn't use the million dollars. I'm not making light of a million dollars, okay. But there are people here that they would sooner give it to. I always said, "Take me there. I'm never going to win." that was my ploy the whole way here. <br/>Jeff: Sash, if you  buy into that, it's a pretty good argument. <br/>It's a good argument  because it increases your odds from 33% to 50% or even 100%. <br/>Jeff: Holly, at the  last tribal council, there were a lot of fingers pointing at you. <br/>That's what I'm  afraid of tonight, also. I know that Dan has talked to Sash about teaming up with the guys and getting  rid of me. <br/>Jeff: Why would that  make sense? <br/>Because Dan said he  would like four guys to go to the final four. <br/>I don't think I ever  said I want four guys to go. The reason why Holly would be voted out is because she's a threat. I don't know where this comes from. <br/>How am I a threat? Explain to me how you think I'm a threat. <br/>The lady from south  dakota, 1,100 people in her town. She's in the final three. That's a threat. <br/>Why is that a threat  where I'm from and how many people I have in my town? <br/>That's my  interpretation. I just think it is. <br/>I don't think that's  a threat at all. <br/>Okay, I think it is. <br/>Jeff: Obviously, Holly,  you're going to say it's not a threat. What matters is not whether Dan is right or wrong, it's that's his perception. <br/>Correct. <br/>Jeff: Chase, at this  point, it really does come down to perception, doesn't it? <br/>It's a constant mind  game. They over there know my mind's always turning. I think Brenda called me paranoid. My mind's always thinking, like, how to win in the end. So it's always a mind game going on. <br/>Jeff: So, Holly, what  do you say to get that target off your back and back on his? <br/>Has he been  aggressive? Has he gone out and talked to people? Has he made the right alliances? But I also think it's really important to remember the numbers in the jury. By assessing who is going to get the least amount of votes, of course that's  the person you want to take. So you have to take all those aspects into consideration when you're this  close to the end. <br/>Jeff: Holly, those  attributes you mentioned, how aggressive was he or wasn't he? What alliances did he or didn't he have? Those all seem to make the argument to take him to the end. He hasn't done anything to earn the money, which is Dan's point exactly. Fabio, if you just isolate it down to Holly and Dan tonight, it's potentially  a million-dollar mistake if you vote the wrong person out. <br/>Um, yeah. It definitely is, and that's something I'm sure we all thought about this  afternoon at camp. A lot of the reasons that Holly pointed out about Dan being a threat is also  why Holly may be a threat as well. I think that a lot of the women on the jury respect Holly as a motherly  figure, and I think that a lot of her answers at tribal council are pretty  good. That's a compliment to Holly. I think she's a pretty cool lady. <br/>Jeff: It's a  compliment, and it's also a warning, Holly. All right, Fabio, you have individual immunity again. You're going to keep that? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Cannot vote for  Fabio. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Chase, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally  the votes. Once the vote are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Dan. Dan. That's two votes Dan. Chase. Two votes Dan, one vote Chase. 14th person voted out and the eighth member of our jury. Dan, that's three. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Dan, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Well, congratulations. You have made it to the final four. Tomorrow, you'll compete in your final immunity challenge. Win tomorrow's challenge, you are in the final three and will have a shot at  the money. Lose, you could be going home. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>I switched my vote  tonight to Chase to tell him how much I dislike the guy. I want nothing to do with you. Holly, you're a crook. You stole my shoes. They ought to cut your damn hands off. Sash, you're just like a whining little girl. [groans] and you're a liar. I wish them the worst, and I can't wait to cast my vote. <br/>Final four. <br/>We're all still here. <br/>It's exciting, right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>We made it, guys. <br/>We did. <br/>I'm excited. <br/>Last four! <br/>You guys, this is a  pretty big deal. <br/>It's a huge deal. Let's have fun tomorrow and tonight. Okay? <br/>Tonight at tribal  council, you know, I felt comfortable because I had the necklace around my  neck, and tomorrow night, for me to feel secure, I'm going to have to have  the immunity necklace again because I really don't know what's going through Chase  and Sash's mind at this point. <br/>Everything at the  moment is going according to plan. I love how things are playing out, because right now, I truly believe that  every single person left will take me to the end, no matter who wins the  final immunity challenge. Fabio wants to take me and believes that I will also take him, but if Fabio  loses, he'll be going home because he's the biggest threat to my end game. <br/>100%. <br/>Anybody goes with  him, it's going to be tough. We've got to give it our all today because, you know, he does win the last  challenge, it's going to be complete scramble. And he knows that. <br/>Yeah, he knows. <br/>So he's going to go  100%, too. Of course he is. We have our final immunity challenge today. And if Fabio does not win individual immunity, he will be the next to go. And Sash, Chase, and I will go to the top three. But if Fabio wins, we will have to turn on our own, and it will be very  interesting to see what happens. We're going to have to discuss what we're going to do because number-wise...  I think Sash would get a lot of votes. <br/>Purple kelly would go  Sash, Dan and Benry would go Sash. <br/>We'll have to wait  and see what happens at the challenge I just want you to know that you and I  need to stick together. <br/>We need to win. <br/>I can really picture  you, me, and Sash in the final three. Do you feel comfortable with that plan? <br/>We'll see how the  challenge goes today and go from there. I don't like the lying part at all to this game, but Holly, Sash, and I have  that alliance. We're pretty strong, and Fabio could be breaking that up if he wins another  immunity. You know, it could be a million-dollar challenge for me, so I'm definitely  going to put pressure on myself and try to win that thing. The last tree mail, y'all. <br/>Tree mail. <br/>Check this out. <br/>A sword? Is that what it is? <br/>It's looks like we're  sword fighting for the... For the million. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>"Congratulations,  final four. You are almost to the end of this adventure. Follow your map from the beach through the jungle and to the top of the  headland. There you will find the torches of your fallen comrades. At each torch, you will collect a representative shield of those who were  voted out before you. At the end of your journey, you will offer them up in a ceremonial burning,  paying respect to their memory. You will then proceed to your final immunity challenge." final challenge. <br/>Wow. Good job, you guys, good job. <br/>We came a long way. <br/>Unbelievable. Going on the rites of passage, I have a huge responsibility. I'm the last one left from the Espada tribe. And I truly want to show my dedication to all the people that I started this  game with. Whether they were the first one voted out or they were just recently voted  out, it is a huge responsibility, and it is an absolute honor. <br/>Wendy jo. <br/>Whenever you looked  at her, she glowed. Wendy jo was great. <br/>I never wanted to be  the first one voted off. If I were to be in this game again, my strategy would be different. I would tell everybody about me and how great I am. [laughs] Shannon! <br/>I'm sure outside this  game Shannon was an awesome guy. During this game, I couldn't trust him. <br/>I got put with the  little kids and they didn't have a clue about life or responsibility and I  didn't want to be out there for another 20 days baby-sitting these children. <br/>Jimmie j. <br/>Jimmie johnson. If it wasn't for jimmie, I wouldn't have made it past day five. He will always have a very special spot in my heart. Wonderful man. <br/>I've coached and  played football, but in "Survivor," out in the elements without  food, with all the rain, and the stress of the game, this out here, it drains  you like nothing I've ever been through before. <br/>Jimmy t. He loved the game. <br/>He's got to be one of  the goofier characters. <br/>Along with you, buddy. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You can't control  "Survivor" and I tried to just get a hold and it became more and  more frustrating. It's amazing how quickly I got knocked down to size, and I'm certainly  humbled. <br/>Tyrone. <br/>Tyrone the fireman. <br/>I knew there was  going to come a time when the social aspect was going to outweigh the  physical aspect and it came earlier than I anticipated. And I probably didn't adjust as quickly as I could have. You live, you learn. <br/>Kelly b. <br/>She came out here and  did what we struggled to do with only one leg, and that's unbelievable. <br/>What an inspiration. <br/>In my life, I have  been through a lot, and in "Survivor" I learned that I am actually  stronger than I expected that I was, and I learned that I have even a thicker  skin than I imagined. <br/>Oh, it's Yve. <br/>Very hard worker. I enjoyed a lot of conversations around the fire with Yve. <br/>My biggest regret  with "Survivor" was when we had the switch, and I didn't take the  initiative, I hesitated. You can't do that in life. From here on out, when I get home, I'm going to do this, and if it doesn't  work out, it doesn't work out. <br/>Jill. <br/>She was good in the  challenges, but I don't think she made enough of an impact on the new La Flor  tribe to stick around. <br/>I expected surviving  in the elements to be a little difficult. I figured that that would be something I would do very well at. What I didn't anticipate, however, is the social aspect of the game would be  equally difficult. Clearly my social game wasn't up to snuff. <br/>Alina. <br/>Probably one of the  best overall competitors in the game, I think. <br/>I'd rather be  eliminated because I'm a threat than to be eliminated because I'm dispensable. So that makes me proud of my game that I was that big of a threat that they  had to get rid of me. <br/>Marty. <br/>Marty. <br/>That guy always had,  like, the master plan, you know. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Always thinking about  numbers. <br/>Big strategist. <br/>Marty. <br/>I would have imagined  that my strategy would have been a little more lying, cheating, and stealing,  and as it turns out, I never lied once. I never really made any promises I couldn't keep, so I loved the way I played  the game. <br/>Brenda. <br/>Great strategist in  the game, and almost a mastermind. So one of the best overall players in the game. <br/>You don't really know  how strong you are until you're tested with things like not eating, not  sleeping, dealing with all these personalities, and I was really proud of  myself because I stayed focused, and I've come out of this a new person. <br/>Naonka. <br/>11 days left, and to  walk out of the game... She had an idol in  her hand when she quit. <br/>Definitely  disappointing. <br/>I quit the game, and  I'm not afraid to say that, but I always had a smile. I was friendly. And I had a very strategical game. I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but I was literally the smartest player  in the game, hands down, and the craziest. <br/>Another quitter. Purple kelly. <br/>Purple kelly. <br/>Probably would have  been better for her to be voted out than to quit. <br/>My reputation is not  a quitter, and people back home, they all know that. So it's going to be hard for me to be seen walking away from something,  because that's not who I am. So that's the worst part. <br/>Benry. Huge physical threat. <br/>Yeah, he was a game  player, man. He was good. <br/>They were smart to  get rid of me because there's no doubt in my mind that I could have won  individual immunity the next three, four, however many challenges. Unless there were some puzzles involved. <br/>Jane. <br/>If there was one  person that deserves to be given a million dollars for how hard they worked  and stuff, it's Jane. <br/>I've had a lot of ups  and downs in my life, but I always knew I could probably out-do any person  out here as far as stamina and I proved to myself I could. I can go back to north carolina with my head held high. <br/>Dan the man. <br/>Dan. <br/>Twice our age, so to  make it this long in the game? Just an incredible feat. <br/>Good job, Dan. <br/>I learned that this  city boy can survive in the wilderness, and this entire experience has  changed me that I won't be such a beatch if I don't get my three meals a day  anymore. I think I'm going to be a lot less spoiled when I get back in new york. <br/>Y'all, we made it. <br/>These are the people  who helped us get there. <br/>Right. <br/>I think we should  definitely respect that. <br/>Sure. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>It feels good to have  gotten this far. It's kind of a big deal, man. It's an accomplishment, you know. And now I've just got to be thinking of this next challenge and how the  million dollars is actually on the line this time. It feels good to even be in a position to compete in something like that. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys. You guys ready to get to your final immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: First things  first. Fabio, once again, I will take it back. For the last and most important time, immunity is back up for grabs. For your final immunity challenge, you will each have a sword. With one hand you will balance the sword on a shield. With your other hand, you will stack coins on the handle of the sword. As the stack of coins gets higher, it will get more difficult to balance. When the stack becomes too high, the coins will fall. You're out of the challenge. Last person left standing wins immunity, is guaranteed a spot in the final  three, and you will get a chance to plead your case to the jury of why you  deserve the title of sole Survivor and the million dollars that goes with it. Losers, tribal council, and somebody's shot at the million dollars will be  over. Make sense? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: All right, pick  up your swords. First thing you want to do is find a spot on that shield that feels  comfortable because you're going to be holding it here throughout the  challenge. Time for the first coin, a medium-sized coin. Five, four, three, two, one. That's how it will work. You'll have a five-second window to get the coin on and get your hand out of  there. All right, next coin will be a large. Five, four, three, two, one. Everybody looking good. Let's put another large on there. Five, four, three, two, one. So you see where this is going. As that stack gets higher, it's going to get more difficult to balance it. Every coin here is slightly uneven. These are not like the coins you are used to that would be very easy to stack. These were made for a "Survivor" challenge, thus difficult. Fabio, very close to losing that stack, but a nice recovery. Time to add another coin. You're going to add a medium coin. During those five seconds, if you want to readjust your stack, if you think  it's leaning, go for it. That is the only time you can touch your coins. Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one. You're going to place another coin. This time a large coin. In five, four, three, two, one. Everybody's clean again. Let's place a medium coin now on this stack. Holly drops a coin. Holly is out of the challenge. We are down to three: Sash, Fabio, and Chase. Time to place your next coin. Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one. Hands away. Chase can't do it. Chase is out of the challenge. Gently take a spot on your platform. We are down to two now. Sash and Fabio have fought for 38 days for this shot. Time to place another coin. You're going to place a large coin now. Here you go. Five, four, three, two, one. Nicely done. Win this, you are going to the final, and you will have a shot at the money. Lose, you could be going home in just a few hours. Potentially a million-dollar challenge right here. Time for another coin. You're going to place a medium coin on your stack. These stacks are getting very high. Take your time. Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one. Fabio's got a little bit of an angle to his stack. The next coin you're going to stack is a large coin. In five, four, three, two, one. Sash drops his coins. Fabio winds final immunity and will go to the final three. <br/>Excellent job, Fabio. Excellent work. <br/>Good job. <br/>Excellent work,  brother. [sighs] Jeff: Fabio, come on  over. <br/>Good job, Fabio. [applause] Jeff: Three times in  a row, you've won immunity. With this around your neck, you are going to final tribal. You will get a shot at the money, a chance to plead your case as to why you  deserve the title of sole Survivor and the million dollars. Sash, Chase, Holly: Tonight at tribal council, one of the three of you will  go home, your shot at the money will be over. You will become the last member of the jury. I expect a very interesting afternoon back at camp. I'll see you tonight at tribal. Grab your stuff; get out of here. Congrats. <br/>Good job, Fabio. Three in a row. You're on fire. <br/>You've got to do what  you've got to do sometimes. <br/>You earned that. <br/>I'm loving this, man. I mean, I won the final immunity challenge, and I get to come back to camp  and watch the three of them try to plead their case for why I should take  them to the final three. Of course Sash and Chase and Holly are all nervous, panicky people anyway. It's going to be fun watching them sweat about this one. I'm just going to let it play out. <br/>I wouldn't mind going  on a water run if somebody needs water. Do you want to go with me? <br/>Sure. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Holly has to be  nervous now. <br/>Yeah. Well, you... Huh? <br/>Yeah, I guess. I haven't made up my mind. <br/>What are you thinking? <br/>I don't know, man. I've got to... I've got to think about things and figure them out. <br/>Right. <br/>I thought we had a  perfect plan of attack to make it all the way to the final three, and  somehow, Fabio pulls off three immunity challenges in a row. So it's a big disaster for my alliance. Right now, I'm as desperate as I've been this entire game. And anything I can do to try and convince Fabio that I should be in the final  three with him, I'll do. No matter what, tonight I vote how you vote. Let's run down the jury. Brenda. I think she'd probably vote Chase, obviously. Naonka, she gave her idol to Chase. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Right? Purple kelly will probably vote Chase. And, you know, if Holly went out... Think she'd vote for Chase? <br/>Yup. <br/>Maybe we do need to  rethink this. Yeah, I mean, you know, Chase has been the one flip-flopping. <br/>Well, it's out of Chase's  hands right now. <br/>Are you okay? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It just seems like  you're a little on edge. <br/>Well, I feel that if  one of you guys would have won immunity, I would have been the next to go. <br/>I can't speak for Chase. I don't know, you know. <br/>Would you have taken Holly  and Chase? <br/>No. I feel like you're my best friend in the game, and I guarantee, I promise  you, I have never said that to anyone else here. I'm serious. <br/>Yeah? Cool. <br/>What did you and Sash  talk about? <br/>He was trying to add  up the jury and make it seem like you were going to get a lot of votes. And it was... Let's sit down, dude. I'm pissed that Sash was trying to go behind my back and trying to get me out. We promised to each other, Sash and I did, that we wouldn't go after each  other, and he goes after me like that and starts talking about me behind my  back. That pisses me off. Sash will do whatever it takes to himself get further in the game. I always kind of thought maybe he's that, but now that Fabio said that, he's  definitely a snake. What all did he say? <br/>I asked had you won  today, would you have taken me in the first place? He said I can't speak for Chase, but I would have. <br/>That's ridiculous. That pisses me off because he's just been talking to me whole time about him,  me, and Holly going to the end. <br/>I knew it. That's what I thought, man. I had a sneaking suspicion. <br/>I'm not going to...  You. He wanted to take me and Holly. <br/>I've had this feeling  about Sash the whole time that he's willing to tell anybody anything, and it  gets to me, you know. But at the same time, look at the position I'm in, and I'm just laughing  like, dude, I can see right through you, and you don't think I can. And I go back to Chase, and I tell him, and he's immediately selling Sash out  to me. It's almost like I just walked into a kitchen, turned the lights on, and all  these little cockroaches are trying to scramble to get out of the way and  throw somebody else under the bus, you know. I mean, would you have taken me to the final three, honestly? <br/>If they would have  said today, if you wouldn't have won today, I honestly think it would be me, Holly  and Sash. <br/>So did I, man. I knew it. <br/>Straight up with you. <br/>Yep. That's what I thought. <br/>Well, Fabio, you  know, I'm not going to lie to you. The three of us were in an alliance, and we wanted to go to the end. I don't know if Chase told you that, but I just want to plead my case to you. I know it's going to be your final decision, but Sash has played a tremendous  game. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Strategically, he's  played very, very well. And I just want you to really seriously think about it. <br/>She has a pretty good  point. <br/>It's just something  that you really need to think about, because when it comes down to votes,  that could be huge. <br/>Could be Dangerous. <br/>Sash and Chase have  lied to me the whole time, saying we would go to the final three together. And now I really feel like I almost don't want to take either of them. Holly is actually the only one that hasn't lied or done anything to me. I have respected you this whole game. <br/>Yeah, and I've  respected you a lot. <br/>Yeah. I'm just trying to think about who is on the jury and how people have played  the game and the relationships they've had with them, and, you know, who  would take votes away from me, and, also, who deserves to go to the final  three. Who I want there, you know. I feel like Holly has played a pretty good game and she does deserve to go to  the final three, but then again, she might deserve jury votes, too. So I've got a big decision to make on who I want to take, and is it going to  cost me a million dollars or not? So my head's definitely spinning, you know, at this point. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring  in the members of our jury. Alina. Marty. Brenda. Naonka. Purple kelly. Benry. Jane. And Dan, voted out at the last tribal council. Fabio, you look like you're holding it in. <br/>Yeah, man. I feel great right now. <br/>Jeff: We haven't even  said a word and you're just bursting. <br/>Yeah, I'm pretty  excited, man. This is final tribal council, and I have the necklace on, and that's a good  feeling. <br/>Jeff: Must have been  a fun afternoon for you. I'm guessing everybody wanted to talk to Fabio. <br/>Yeah, it was pretty  funny. You know, the past couple of days, I definitely have felt on the outs. It was funny to watch a three-person alliance each give their own angle of  why they should be coming. It was a fun afternoon, yes. <br/>Jeff: What was Sash's  approach? <br/>Sash was the first  person to talk to me. You know, he immediately said, "Who do you want to take?" and I  asked him, "If one of you guys would have won today, would you have  taken me? Because that was the agreement that us three guys had come to." and he  said, "Yeah, you know, for sure, definitely." but there was a part  of me that, you know, kind of saw through that. <br/>Jeff: You didn't buy  it. <br/>No. <br/>Jeff: How about Chase? <br/>Chase and I had a  good conversation, and I asked Chase as well, "If one of you guys would  have won, would you have taken me for real?" and he said, "Probably  not." and I said, "I knew it." because they asked me to give  them my word on a plan, and I didn't really get anything in return, so it was...  It was interesting. <br/>Jeff: Sash, we get  back from the challenge, you go to Fabio. What's your plead? <br/>I go to Fabio and I  tell him that it's something we've been talking about for a while now, and  who would probably carry more jury votes than others. <br/>Jeff: Now, Fabio's  going to tell you that he talked to Chase nd Chase says that's bs. <br/>Truth is, jeff, I've  had many alliances with many different people in this game. And I'm not afraid to admit that, and I think over the past few days, I've  been more committal to you than Chase has. <br/>So right now, if you  had won today, would you have taken me to the final three, like we had talked  about? <br/>I believe I would  have. <br/>Jeff: Wait, you  believe you would have or you would have? <br/>Well, I didn't have  the idol, so I didn't have to make that decision. But I... That's what I'm  talking about, you know. <br/>It's true that I did  make an alliance with Chase and Holly. I did make an alliance with Fabio. I promised two different groups of people if I won, I would take them to the  end. <br/>Jeff: Holly, what was  your pitch to Fabio? <br/>Fabio and I were  sitting in the hut. First of all, I told him that I was very proud of him, and I told him  number-wise, Sash was a huge threat, and he should be the next one to go. He also asked me, "If I wouldn't have won today, would I have been voted  out tonight?" and I said yes. <br/>Jeff: So you also  told Fabio you would have voted him out? <br/>Yes, I was honest. <br/>Jeff: So that means  the only person in question is Sash when he told you, "No, I would have  stuck with you." Yeah. <br/>Jeff: So now, Fabio,  the decision becomes " who do I want to sit next to at the end?" Yeah, you know, after  hearing today that the whole plan we talked about and the agreement we were  under wasn't true, you know, I feel like I do have the right to take whoever. I don't have to uphold that anymore. <br/>Jeff: All right,  before we get to the vote, Sash, your last chance to pitch Fabio. <br/>Fabio, we've been in  this since the beginning. I believe I've been the most honest and most committed to you. I hope that my options reflect that. <br/>Jeff: Chase, your  last chance. Lay it out. <br/>Fabio, the most  honest and committed to you, kind of came out tonight. I was pretty damn honest with you. So... Yeah, yeah, you know. At the very last second. You were pretty honest with me at the very last second. So, yeah, I would agree. <br/>Jeff: All right, Holly,  your last chance. <br/>I was very honest  with you this afternoon, and I was honest. I said we wouldn't have taken you in our alliance. And I'm glad you respect me and think highly of me. That means a lot to me. <br/>Good, thank you, Holly. <br/>Jeff: All right, Fabio,  well, there are certainly arguments working for and against Holly, Chase and Sash. It could very well be a million-dollar decision. Fabio has immunity. I don't have to ask. You cannot vote for Fabio. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Holly, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally  the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Sash. Holly. One vote Holly. Holly. Two votes Holly, one vote Sash. One vote left. 15th person voted out and the ninth and final member of our jury, Holly. You need to bring me your torch. Holly, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Well, congratulations. You've gone as far as you can go in this game. The power shifts to the jury, nine people that you had a hand, either  directly or indirectly, in voting out will now hold your fate in their hands. I suggest you start thinking about what you're going to say to convince these  guys that you're the one deserving of the title of sole Survivor and the  million-dollar check. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Day five, I wanted to  walk away from this game. Here I am making it through day 38. So never give up. One thing I know is that my family and my true friends back home are going to  be truly proud of me. <br/>Hey-o! <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>On a scale of one to  ten, I am about a ten right now. It took me 38 days to finally get into a powerful position, but now I'm  finally here. <br/>Fabio, I appreciate  it, man. You made that happen tonight, buddy. <br/>Tonight, I brought  the heat a little bit, kind of upset the stage, because putting Sash against Chase  lets the jury know I really am aware of what's going on. It's like we said. <br/>Final three, baby! <br/>I still feel like I  have a bit more to say tomorrow night, and I think the jury is going to be  receptive to it. <br/>You were the  underdog, you know. They loved it. And I've got to say, you sure as hell earned it. We all kind of fought for our lives tonight, and it was almost like we were  fighting for our lives, and Fabio could say whatever he wanted to. But guns will be blazing tomorrow. I'm excited to, you know, bring my thoughts tomorrow now that I know I'm safe. I'm proud of all of us, man, that's awesome. <br/>We all deserve it. <br/>That's great. <br/>Awesome. <br/>I got called out on  pretty much everything in this game, from not keeping alliances to  flip-flopping to switching votes around. And between being unsure whether or not I was going home tonight and being  called out, it was really a double whammy for me. <br/>I wanted us three to  be sitting at breakfast just smiling at each other. <br/>I wanted that, too. The only problem was, you know, you get in an alliance, you don't want to  break. <br/>Yeah. <br/>But tonight, thanks  to you, we had to break it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Fabio and Chase, I  really don't think they deserve to be in the final three, because I really do  feel as though I've played the best strategic game. <br/>To end up with two  guys who are just awesome... My two wingmen. <br/>Sash goes, "I'd  be honored for you guys to be my wingman." I'm like, "Sash, dude,  you can take a back seat. I want you to take notes on how this is going to go, because it's going to be  fun." Day 39, man. This has been an awesome journey. And I loved every part of it, you know. I've envisioned this day for a long time, and now it's actually here. <br/>It's day freaking 39,  baby! <br/>And this is probably  the most important day of my life. This is, like, 39 days of exhaustion. This is about the furthest I could go, man. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Dude. <br/>I see champagne  bottles! <br/>Pancake mix! <br/>Syrup! Whoo! Final three, baby! <br/>That's right. <br/>Final three. <br/>Out here, we're  literally starving, and the day 39 breakfast is such a special treat. To wake up, have everything presented in front of me is just overwhelming to  all the senses, and the food just heightens that great feeling you have from  within. <br/>Wow. I've been waiting so long for this, guys. <br/>Tonight I go to  battle with Chase and Fabio to try and win the title of sole Survivor and the  million dollars. But they've also been allies of mine, which have helped me get to where I'm  at today, so we're best of friends and worst of enemies. <br/>You guys, we're going  to remember this for the rest of our lives. <br/>This couldn't be a  better final three. <br/>There's a lot of talk  about being happy, being together. I mean, I'm happy to be with these guys. I'm happy to be final three, but for me it's completely false. I'm still working the game right now trying to figure out how I'm going to  beat these guys. <br/>How do you think tonight  is going to go, man? <br/>I think no matter  what, God's honest truth, you just won a million dollars. <br/>Yeah, possibly. <br/>I keep telling Fabio  that I think that he's going to win and congratulations and all this stuff,  but in my mind, I'm still trying to beat him. And I want to get it in his head that he's got it and get him a little  overconfident. If I can get him a little overconfident, that can help me. <br/>This is a really  great moment. <br/>Got to take it all  in, one last time, baby. <br/>Great, great memories. <br/>Well, I guess we've  got to go get ready. It's time to shift gears and focus on tonight's tribal council, because if  you're not completely in it to win it tonight, you're going to miss your  chance at a million dollars, and those are the largest stakes I've ever  played for. So I'm going to go into this last tribal council swinging. <br/>You ready, Fabio? <br/>Let's each grab a  torch and put it on in. <br/>I'm definitely  nervous about facing the jury tonight, because I've done a lot of  backstabbing. I've made a lot of alliances that I wasn't able to keep. So I'm going to the final tribal council tonight hoping to put everything out  on the table and be 100% truthful, because I think that's the only way I'm  going to have an opportunity to win their vote. <br/>Burn. <br/>Hey! There goes the tarp. <br/>Worked so hard for  those. <br/>She is on fire. <br/>Tonight, I am the  underdog going in. I've got to pull off an upset. I think the main differences in mine and Fabio's game was, I actually did  have relationships with these people. I think that could help me definitely. I think I played a better game than Sash. <br/>Libertad. <br/>Let it burn, baby! I had a huge target on my back from the beginning as a physical threat, and  I'm still here at the end. Obviously, that means I did something right so I'm going into tribal council  tonight like it is a battle, because I didn't come out here playing for  second place in this game. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring  in our jury. Alina. Marty. Brenda. Naonka. Purple kelly. Benry. Jane. Dan. And Holly, voted out at the last tribal council. All right, Chase, Fabio, Sash. Congratulations. You lasted 39 days. You've gone as far as you can go in this game. Tonight, the power shifts to the jury. Nine people that you played alongside hold your fate in their hands. Tonight they will make a million-dollar decision. Here's how it's going to work. You will each get a chance to make an opening statement. Then the jury will get their first chance to address you. Then we vote. Let's get to the opening statements. Chase, you're up first. <br/>All right, y'all. First of all, obviously, I want to thank you all for getting me to where I am. It's truly an honor to play the game with every single one of you. It's been an honor. Y'all know that. Having said, that, tonight, bring on the questions. I want to you bring on the questions. I'm looking forward to each and every one of you bringing on questions,  because I know that some of you are pissed at me. A lot of you said I played a crazy game. I've gone back and forth. I've been wishy-washy. I want to say bring it on and I will be completely honest with you and tell  you exactly what happened and why I did some of the things I did in this  game, so bring it on. Let's go. <br/>Jeff: All right, Fabio. You're up. <br/>I also want to say I  enjoyed each one of you. I think we all had a lot of good times. Part of my strategy was to be myself to the fullest, be an open book. I knew that I was in the clear a lot of time, and when it came down to the  end and I really needed to assert myself, you know, I felt like I did that. And winning three immunity challenges in a row, that was survival mode, you  know. And I deserve to be in the final three. I played a stand-up game. I don't think I backstabbed any of you guys, and I just think I deserve a  million dollars. I could have a lot of fun. <br/>Jeff: Sash, you're up. <br/>Thanks, jeff. I really enjoyed playing the game with everyone. And I played much differently than both Chase and Fabio. Really, there are three components to win the title of sole Survivor. That's outwit, outplay, and outlast. All three of us were able to outlast to day 39. So, really, tonight's vote comes down to strategy and who is able to outwit  and outplay. Lastly, I just wanted everyone to know that the friendships that I formed, I  take much more seriously than the actual alliances. Alliances are part of the game, and I'm sorry if some of the alliances were  broken. But that was part of the game, and I hope you respect me for that. <br/>Jeff: All right,  jury, you're about to get your first chance to address Chase, Fabio, and Sash. I'll give you a moment to think about what you want to say. <br/>Jeff: All right,  jury, some of you have waited a long time for the opportunity to grill Chase,  Fabio and Sash. Your job tonight, gather information to help you make a million-dollar vote. Let's get started. Brenda, you're up first. <br/>Hey, guys. Congratulations. I am really, really, really proud of you guys. Sash, I really enjoyed playing with you. You were a great strategist. 'cause making an alliance is smart, but then breaking all of them, and then  having to ask and expect votes from the jury? <br/>It was very  difficult, and that's why I want to start off by saying that I am remorseful. I did have to backstab nine people, but I hope people can see that what  happened in the game was part of strategy, and my friendship is something  different, and I apologize. <br/>Thanks, Sash. Chase, my snuggle buddy. I felt like I had more of an emotional attachment to you since, you know, you  would always tell me that you trusted me the most, and that you could never  vote for me. And it was really shocking how easy it was for you the day that I got voted  out to just kind of accept it. <br/>I did put my neck on  the line for you. As soon as, you know, the other alliance was talking about voting you out,  what was the first thing I did? I came to you and I said, "Listen, this is what Holly is trying to do  with this alliance." I, obviously, don't want to do that. I trust you the most, which I did, so I thought the best thing to do was go  out and get a sixth person. What happened is Fabio and NaOnka backed out. That gave me absolutely no option. <br/>Well, why were you  shaking your head, Sash? <br/>I just think Chase  could have stepped up more. <br/>What could I have  done... You, too, Sash. Don't even start. You could have stepped up, too. You could have given me the idol. I could have kept on going if you could have given it to me. I think I'm good. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Brenda. <br/>Thanks, guys. <br/>Jeff: Marty, you're  up. <br/>Guys, what can I say? There's real good reasons why you guys are there and we're here, so hats off  to you guys. It's got to be an incredible feeling for you guys. <br/>Appreciate it. <br/>Chase, play this out  with me, okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>"Survivor: Nicaragua,"  there's going to be dumber than a bag of hammers award, okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>You have to pick  somebody. Okay. It can be one of you three or it can be somebody on the jury. The only caveat, obviously, I'm not eligible for the award, okay. So you can't vote for me. Who do you pick for the dumber than a bag of hammers this year? <br/>Well, obviously, I'm  not going to pick any one of us because we're sitting up here and y'all are  over there. <br/>Clearly, that's how I  started out talking to you guys. <br/>I think this is kind  of a bs question, because I can't pick you. <br/>Sorry, man, I made  the rules. Go ahead, make your choice again. <br/>Do I have to answer  this question because I don't think anyone is, except for you. <br/>That's cool, all  right. If you don't choose to answer, that's totally your option. My man, Sash. You know I think you're a cerebral player. Chase, that means smart, but anyway... I appreciate that one. <br/>I think you've been a  solid strategist. We spent a good time talking about stuff, and, Fabio. <br/>What's up? <br/>Dude. <br/>Dude. <br/>I think you've  changed the most as a person and as a player. Congratulations again, especially winning three immunities in a row. <br/>Thank you, man. <br/>Thanks, guys. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Thanks, Marty. <br/>Jeff: Holly, you're  up. <br/>Chase, what do you  consider your best strategical move that you made on your own in this game? <br/>It was in the very  beginning of the game. I had a chance to go with people that I didn't trust and an alliance of six  versus four, or I had a chance to go with four people that I could trust. I took that chance in the beginning. That was to vote Shannon out. That was the biggest move for me in the game because it allowed me to play  with people I could trust. <br/>Okay. Fabio, do you think winning the last three immunity challenges was too  little, too late? <br/>No, I think it was  actually [chuckles] the best timing possible. I knew that there was going to be no way that people would take me to the  final three, because my whole plan was to be friends with everybody. Winning the challenges was the only option I had. I don't think it was too little, too late. I think it was, you know, right on time. <br/>Okay. Sash, did you ever lie to me? Honestly, be honest, very honest. <br/>Yes, I lied to you. You and I both made a commitment that we would never put each other's names  down. And, unfortunately, on the last vote, you and I both had to vote against each  other, and I apologize to you for having to do that at the end of the game. I'm sorry. <br/>I truly respect you  guys. I had a great time. Thanks. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Jane. <br/>Hello, everybody. All right, tonight I'm going to start my questions with Sash. All I have to say, somebody sure as hell raised you good to be a new york  city river rat. And as far as I'm concerned, you can go back to new york city gutters and  crawl back into the backhole that you came from. Okay? Now, Chase. <br/>Yep. <br/>Even though I am  still totally pissed at you... I don't blame you. <br/>...You did make my  time out here the funnest event I've ever had in my life. If I awarded you the million dollars, what would do you with it? <br/>I've had this  bracelet on my wrist the entire time I've been here. It says hunt the cure on it. Hunt the cure was started by my brother. The reason he started it was because we lost my dad from skin cancer, and  then he had a heart attack. If I win $1 million, $100,000 is going to hunt the cure to help to raise  money for cancer. That's the first thing I'm going to do. The second thing, if I win $1 million, I'm taking care of my mom. She's making money on herself, but I want to take care of my mom. <br/>I want to take care  of my mom and dad as well. I mean, that's a very... That's a very sincere... I think we all want to take  care of our moms. <br/>Well, I thoroughly  enjoyed meeting both of your parents, okay. Thank you for your answers, and good luck. <br/>Thanks, Jane. <br/>Jeff: Benry, you're  up. <br/>Congrats, fellas. Chase, I think I've heard everything I need to hear from you tonight. Fabs, congrats on the back-to-back-to-back immunity wins. You played a savage game. Is it good enough? You'll have to wait and see. [chuckles] Sash. <br/>Hey, Benry. <br/>Throughout the entire  game, I was able to see through the fake smile, the a-ha laugh, but I want to  know, what told you that I was a mark? Tell me about myself. What did I do wrong? <br/>You said you could  see through me. If that was the case, you probably should have mounted a strike against me to  try to take me out. I thought you were a solid player. I really did. It's just I didn't think you'd be willing to take me to the end, so that's  why I sent you home. <br/>All right, appreciate  it. Congrats, fellas. <br/>Thanks, Benry. <br/>Jeff: Dan. You're up. <br/>Okay. Sash, I think you're a liar. I think you're a phony. You said things to me, and you never lived up to them. I think you're spineless. And I hate that smile, and I think if I was you, I'd go to the doctor  tomorrow and get that eye fixed so you stop doing the wink. Chase, you were the most paranoid player in this entire game, okay, whether  you care or not. <br/>I absolutely... I... I mean, there's a lot  of people bleeding here because of you, a lot of people bleeding here. You backstabbed everybody. You backstabbed me. You backstabbed Jane, Jane who was your righthand person. When it came to you, she was gone. So you really let people down. You let me down tremendously. <br/>This is  "Survivor," Dan. <br/>I'm going to tell you  something, okay. Beauty fades. Dumb is forever. That's all I have to say. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Dan. Purple kelly. You're up. [sighs] Congratulations, you  guys. You guys did what I couldn't do. You stuck through all of this, and you played the game like crazy. My question is for Sash. I'm going to give you 60 seconds to explain how you outwit all of us. <br/>Very good. I really think I should have been voted out at the merge, but I wasn't. So I kept on moving forward by creating many alliances. It was unfortunate, now that I get all this feedback, that I've hurt so many  people, but I have to own up to it tonight, and that's what I'm trying to do. <br/>That is not the  answer I was expecting. And the honesty I love. I feel like that was perfect. And that's all I have for you guys. <br/>Thanks, kelly. <br/>You guys are awesome. <br/>Thanks, purple. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Purple  Kelly. Naonka. <br/>Hi, guys. Chase, you were my brother throughout the game. Fabio, you were my hippie friend, and, Sash, you were the strategic player. Fab-I-o. It's been a pleasure cussing you out. You know, you won the first immunity idol after the merge, and then when it  came down to it, where it counted, you ended up getting three in a row. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You got to see your  mom on one of those rewards. Was that gasoline to boost you into, what, phase ten? <br/>I didn't actually go  on the reward with my mom. It was just at the challenge they saw her, and I daydreamt every single day  out here what I could do for my family, and it... Yeah, man... It got me to  the end. Yeah, you know, that's just something inside of you that comes out when it's  necessary. I never felt like that before in my life. I never put that kind of focus into something. And there was so much emotion going on, the jealousy, because these three had  a plan to get here, and I felt like I really did deserve to be here. You know, love for my family. So, yeah, that was my gasoline to get to the end. <br/>I appreciate your  realness. For real, 'cause I had my moments where I've cried. You've got dig deep in this game. So good luck. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, NaOnka. Alina, you're up. <br/>Hi, guys. Fabio, you're like the ultimate surfer boy, like, dude. I love that about you, but I don't really want to give a million dollars to a  boy. I want to give a million dollars to a man. Sash, this is your shot. Like, you worked for your spot here. Convince me you deserve it more than the young guys. <br/>Right, well,  throughout the game, when tribal council was coming up, I feel as though Fabio  was either the last to know or played aloof until someone told him right  before tribal. <br/>I knew a lot more  than you guys gave me credit for. I just want to say that. <br/>You weren't in on  every votes. There were many times we went to tribal council where Fabio thought the vote  was going one way where it really went another. And Chase was wishy-washy, would go from one alliance to the other, leak  information back and forth, and waited for someone else to make the decision. <br/>Okay, okay. Chase, I'm actually pleasantly surprised by you tonight. You came in here strong. Tell me I have to vote for you and not the other guys. <br/>People say I was  wishy-washy, people say I did one thing and all this. It wasn't wishy-washy. It was me making myself a way out where I could play with people I could  trust but didn't get myself in the situation where, if the alliance was done,  I'm done. When we did vote people out, it really did hurt me, going behind the backs  and say, "Why do you think I'm so close with her?" like Sash did  with Brenda to vote those people out. And a guy like Fabio, he's got the strategy not to piss people off but still  make it through the game. I don't think that's true. Half the tribal councils we came back from, Fabio was like, "What the  hell happened?" he didn't know who was voted out. That's not a strategy. <br/>You tried to get  through the game without offending anybody, without double-crossing anybody,  this and that, but I actually did it. You know, I didn't have to backstab anybody, and that's hard to do in this  game. <br/>It is hard to do, but  he didn't do it by the strategy he's talking about. He did it by not knowing what the hell was going on half the time. And I'm sorry, he won three in a row to get here, and that's impressive. But this isn't the n.B.A. Finals. This isn't what it takes to win four and win the championship, this is  outwit, outplay and outlast, and winning three in a row isn't doing that. <br/>That's outplaying  you, bro. <br/>You didn't outlast me. You outplayed me in some of the challenges. <br/>I brought you to the  final three. <br/>And I appreciate that. <br/>Outlast gets you to  here. But the real question should be, who was able to outplay and who was able to  outwit? <br/>Well, you didn't  outplay anybody, Sash. <br/>I like what's  happening here. I like that this is, like, two, maybe three men really fighting for what they  want. Thank you, guys. You guys helped a lot. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, Alina. All right, jury asked a lot of good questions, gathered a lot of interesting  information. Now it is time to take all of this information and decide which one of these  three, you think deserves the title of sole Survivor and the million-dollar  check that goes along with it. Take a moment, think about it, and then we will vote. <br/>Jeff: All right,  jury, tonight you have had an opportunity to hear a lot of information that's  going to help you decide if you are voting for Chase or Fabio or Sash. Tonight's the night you want to see your name written down. For the last time, it is time to vote. Purple kelly, you're up. <br/>Chase is the dumbest  player to ever play this game, and Sash is a weasel. Fabio, man, I love you, and I loved your game. I believe everything you said tonight. You are awesome. <br/>It's been a pleasure. <br/>Chase, you impressed  me today. You came in here like somebody I have never seen before. You had your game face on today, and I was so impressed by you. Congratulations. <br/>Come on, Fabio. Come on. I want you to do that for your mom. [clicks tongue] I hope that you win,  and I am really proud of you. Congratulations. <br/>Jeff: I'll go get the  votes. <br/>Good game, guys. <br/>Good game. <br/>Jeff: Chase, Fabio, Sash,  it's been a long 39-day adventure. I know you'd like to see the results of the vote right now, but you're gonna  have to wait. I'll see you back in l.A. For the reading of the votes. [cheers and applause] Jeff: Hello! All right! Let's get to it. Wow! Thank you for the affection and the loyalty. Let's get to this vote. Here we go. Love the enthusiasm. Nice to be live. Well, for a season that started old versus young, I think it says a lot that  we have three people from the young tribe in the final. Congratulations. But there can only be one winner. The winner of "Survivor: Nicaragua" gets a million dollars. Could be life changing. There are nine votes in here. These are votes for a winner. Let's read them. <br/>Love you, Fabio! [whooping] Jeff: First vote. Fabio. [applause] one vote Fabio. Chase. One vote Fabio, one vote Chase. Fabio that's two votes Fabio, one vote Chase. We are tied. Two votes Fabio, two votes Chase. Chase. That's three votes Chase, two votes Fabio. Chase. Four votes Chase, two votes Fabio. Fabio. That's four votes Chase, three votes Fabio. Two votes left. Fabio. We are tied. We have four votes Chase, four votes Fabio. One vote left. The winner of "Survivor: Nicaragua"... Fabio! [applause] Fabio. Come on down! [applause continues]
