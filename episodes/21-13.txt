<br/> Jeff: Previously on Survivor,  did you ever have one of those days where everything goes wrong? Welcome to Sash's world. After four weeks in the jungle, Sash had it all. <br/>I love having the  power in this game. <br/>Jeff: A hidden  immunity idol in his pocket, his closest ally NaOnka had another one, and the  third person in his clique, Purple Kelly, did whatever he said. <br/>I'm not as wise as  some of these people, but as long as I keep Sash close, I think I'll be fine. <br/>Jeff: The Sash train  was in perfect position to go all the way to the end. <br/>I hold more chips  than anyone else. <br/>Jeff: And then the  wheels came off. First NaOnka gave her idol to Chase. <br/>I'm not going to  mention too much about my idol. I'm just going to kind of lay low, but I'm not planning on playing it. <br/>Jeff: Then at tribal  council, both NaOnka and Purple Kelly threw in the towel. <br/>I'm going to quit. <br/>I'm going to quit. <br/>Jeff: That means the  rest of you just moved up two notches and didn't have to vote anybody out. Now there are two alliances, Chase, Holly and Jane on one side, Benry, Fabio  and Dan on the other. Want to go? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Go. Head out. Seven are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>And then there were  seven. <br/>Yeah. <br/>There's the fire. If we can get that started, you guys can see. We have to go to tribal council because of them, sit there and get wet and  now here we are wet, and they're all dry. Tonight we had a tribal council, and NaOnka and kelly decided to quit. 20 people out of how many people are given this opportunity, and 11 days  left, and they walk out. Unbelievable. <br/>Is there an egg today? <br/>No. <br/>Have we given her  name yet? <br/>We should name her...  Kelly-nay. 'cause they're both chicken. <br/>We'll have to bring  that up at tribal. We named our chicken kelly-nay, after you chickens. <br/>For everyone in the  tribe, losing two was a huge plus. Probably the person that did not benefit the most was me because Chase, he's  aligned tightly with Holly and Jane, and then on the other side of the  spectrum is Dan, Fabio and Benry, who have also formed a close alliance. Now, I have a hidden immunity idol, so I still think the odds are in my favor  to try and make a run for it, but it's gonna be more difficult than what I  thought. <br/>You know, essentially  what I'm saying is the next tribal council, I'm definitely playing the idol. I think the idol right now may be putting target on my back. So what I'd like to do is just get rid of it and hopefully that will show  everyone I'm kind of like a free agent and whoever wants my vote to try and  get them further, it's kind of up for grabs because I know people are trying  to figure out, you know, what their end game is, but I think it's the safest  move for me, personally, to just play it right now. Get rid of it. I'm no longer a threat to the future, and hopefully that will keep me around  longer. <br/>Makes sense. <br/>I just want to be up  front. Right now it's an individual game. So I really have to do what's best for me. I'm a swing vote. No matter who I align with, I know I'm going to be the number-four man, so  pretty much make me your best offer, and I'll decide then. <br/>My thing is, and I've  said it from the beginning, I want to play this game with people that I trust,  and I did that. You know, I've done that with you. I've done that with Brenda. Unfortunately we couldn't keep Brenda in the game. We talked about that. I think it's definitely in our best interest to go with the women, absolutely. <br/>Right. And, you know, then, you know, ideally it comes down to four of us, and I  think the only person that could beat you at the end is Jane. If by some reason, Jane makes it to the end, you still take me, though, right? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Yeah, okay. I just wanted to make sure. <br/>Another thing that  you're lucky about right now, you and Holly will absolutely be going on some  sick rewards, so you know. <br/>I hope so. <br/>You will, 'cause you  missed out yesterday. She definitely will go on the next one. <br/>Oh, yeah, I mean, my  thing is if anyone wins next, I think they should take Holly because she  deserves it the most. <br/>I think you are next  in line for the rewards. <br/>Well, I appreciate  that. <br/>Let's shake on it,  look me in the eye. 100%. You know I'm good for that. <br/>Okay. <br/>I really need a  reward right now, especially some food. I am literally starving, and aside from Holly, I've gone the longest without  a food reward recently, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that there's some  food on the horizon. <br/>Jeff: Come on, in  guys. Day 30. You've made it 30 days. Nice work, you guys. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Jeff: For today's  challenge, you're going to get a second chance to revisit some of the  challenges from the past. Here's how it works. On my go you'll race through a mud pit, then dig through a pile of hay to  retrieve a ball. You'll bounce the ball off a shield into a barrel. First four people to get their ball in their barrel move on to the next round. In this round you'll use a stick to retrieve a key hanging overhead. The key unlocks a chest that contains four sand bags. You'll then attempt to land your sand bags on top of a barrel. The first two people to get all their sand bags on the barrel move on to the  final round. In the final round, you'll have a paddle. You'll use it to dig up three rope rings. The first person to land all three rings on the target wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yep. <br/>Jeff: The winning  person will leave here and be taken to a private resort. You'll have a beautiful meal, have a shower, get a good night's sleep and  return to camp in the morning refreshed for these last nine days. Worth playing for? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: All right. We're gonna draw for spots. We'll get started. All right, here we go. For reward, the first four move on to the next round. Survivors ready? Go! Chase through the mud very fast. Fabio's out. Benry's out. Got to find your ball in the hay. Chase has his quickly. Got to take it out of the bag. Jane is now through. Got to find that ball and then you have to bounce it off the shield into your  barrel. Chase short, Fabio short. Benry gives it a shot. Chase gets his ball in. Chase is moving on! Jane is moving on. We are looking for two more. Benry moving on to the next round. Holly moving on to the next round! All right. For the next round, it is Chase, Jane, Benry and Holly. First two to finish move on to the final round. Survivors ready? Go! First you got get that key off. Chase has his key easily. Benry has his key. Holly and Jane really struggling to get these keys off. Chase has his chest open and his sand bags. Got to land all four sand bags on your barrel. Chase lands his first one. Chase has his second bag. Chase has three bags in a row. Benry lands his first bag. Chase has four in a row. Chase moving on. Benry with one bag left. There it is! Chase and Benry in the final. <br/>Like a softball  pitch, baby. <br/>Jeff: All right, here  we go. Winner of this wins reward. Survivors ready? Go. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Jeff: You got to dig  up three rope rings and then land them on the hooks. First person to do it going to have a nice reward. Chase has his first rope ring. Chase has his second rope ring. Chase has all three rope rings. It's like he's done this challenge before. <br/>Nice job, Chase. <br/>Jeff: He lands his  first one with one shot, his second one with a second shot. Just misses on the third. <br/>Come on, Chase. Hurry, Chase! <br/>Jeff: Chase landed  his first two rings with two tosses. And there's number three. Chase wins reward! <br/>Good job, both you  guys. Good job, Benry. Good job, Chase. <br/>Jeff: All right, Chase. <br/>Want to hug me jeff? <br/>Jeff: Nah. Chase, you're going to leave here. You'll be taken to a private resort, get a nice, big meal, go to your room,  get a shower, get cleaned up and get a good night sleep. Part of this reward includes bringing two people with you. Who is the first person coming with you? <br/>Easy decision. Holly. She gave up reward last time. I'm going to take her. <br/>Jeff: Holly, come on  over. <br/>Plus it's my 25th wedding  anniversary. <br/>Jeff: All right, Chase. One more spot. In choosing one person, you leave four behind. <br/>I love you guys, but  I feel like I have to take Jane. I love you guys to death, and I apologize. <br/>Jeff: Sash, Dan, Fabio,  Benry, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back the camp. <br/>Chase actually said  to me next reward if he wins it, he's going to take me on it. Right now it could go either way. Chase knows I have an idol, so for him to make that risky of a move when you  he probably already has Jane's vote locked up, is incredibly stupid. <br/>Yeah, true. A little extra room in the shelter tonight. <br/>Dude, as far as I'm  concerned, it worked out, man. Chase picked the two least strategic people to go with him. <br/>With Chase choosing Jane  and Holly to go on the reward, he was not only probably making one of the  dumbest moves in the game thus far by leaving me, who is really a wild card,  back at camp to possibly maneuver myself with the other alliance, being Benry,  Fabio and Dan. <br/>I just want to be up  front. I'm not sure what your plans are. It's obvious that there's a three-three split, and I just want to know what  you're thinking, because it's obvious I'm going to be the number four man on  any three-person alliance. So, you know, let's just really think about it today and see what we can do  to not only get them off, but, you know, what we can do to make it all the  way to the final four. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>If we get those three  off, us four go. <br/>But only three or two  make it to final tribal, so I just want to hear your game plan and your  strategy. <br/>So what you're saying  you might side with them? That what you're saying is that you might side with them. <br/>Honestly, none of you  have come forward and told me your game plan yet. <br/>It keeps changing  every day. <br/>From here on out, I  want you to feel free to tell me whatever you want instead of, you know, us  saying one thing and going back. I trust everyone here. <br/>And we're going to  trust you to not go back on your word. <br/>Of course. <br/>We tried to get Sash  back in with us, and we approached him and he said, "I'm with you guys,  I'm with you guys, I'm with you guys, I'm with you guys," but people  don't trust Sash, and they're crazy if they do after what he did to his own  right-hand girl, and after what he did to Brenda and after what he did to Marty. But if Sash goes with Chase and the two ladies, they have four. We only have three. So I have no choice but to trust Sash. <br/>Watermelon. <br/>A toast. <br/>A toast. Here we go. <br/>Great job. <br/>To a wonderful day. Thank you, Chase, for picking me. Overnight massages with the two oldest ladies left on Survivor. How does that feel? <br/>I'm in good company. <br/>Chase won, and I was  so much praying that Chase would pick me. A tiki hut! I always wanted to live in a tiki hut. Aren't tiki huts awesome? <br/>The way the little  tiki hut was built was really cool because we had a little outside bathroom  amenities. Wow, look out here! <br/>Look how much  freaking weight I've lost. <br/>Look at your beard. Look how skinny you are. <br/>I know. I'm like a rack of bones. <br/>Soap! <br/>Oh, wow, look at that. Look at that, an outdoor shower. <br/>I mean, it was just  awesome. <br/>Go, Holly, go, Holly's  stripping. Girl, go! <br/>Chase picked Jane and  me to go on the reward, leaving Sash behind. I just kind of went, oh, no, and I thought he made the wrong choice. <br/>Holly, we got to talk. I really screwed up today picking Jane. <br/>I'm not going to lie,  you did. <br/>You should've  whispered to me or something. Sorry, it's not your fault. The problem is now they're going to be gunning for us. If they have four, they're going to be gunning for three of us. <br/>I agree. <br/>I'm so stupid for not  picking Sash. <br/>If he goes with that  group, it's going to be Jane, you and me. That's the pecking order that they're going to go. It's going to be the three of us bright and early. We need to talk later just you and I. <br/>I've been a little  flighty throughout the game, not making decisions and sticking with them,  which could come back to hurt me. It's mistakes that I'm making. I don't need to be doing that too much because then people stop trusting me. Now Sash is back at camp with Benry, Fabio and Dan. That's terrible. They could forge one up and pick us off one by one. I got to get back to camp tomorrow and figure out where Sash's head is at. That's all I can do. <br/>I love massages. <br/>I'm going to enjoy  this reward while I'm here and try to do damage control tomorrow. <br/>I don't want Sash to  think that he can go with Chase. I want, you know, we definitely want Sash to think he has no way of getting  to the final three if he goes with Chase and those girls. <br/>Trust me, he knows  what's good for him. <br/>Not only are Holly  and Chase a big threat to Sash, nobody wants to go to the final three with Jane  anyway. So I think if Sash were smart, he'd make the right decision and jump on board  with us and take himself a lot further in this game. <br/>Hey, dinner. <br/>Do you guys think Jane  will be upset we killed her chicken and ate it without her? <br/>Her chicken? <br/>I think the alliances  were really defined today. We can really use Sash to our advantage in this game. I'm not going to take any chances. That kid has been shifty this entire game and hasn't really been able to make  up his mind. So I have a feeling he's still in the same boat and something tells me he's a  lot closer to Holly, Jane and Chase than Dan, Fabio and I. <br/>Kelly-nay. <br/>Kelly-nay no longer. [flies buzzing] They didn't have to  eat her. I mean, they got enough rice here for 20 days probably. I did love my chicken. They didn't have to eat her. Anyway, I found out when I got back they did kill the chicken, so I made her  a little memorial over there and made her a little cross, a little heart  shape out of the little shells from the hermit crabs that I made and told her  a little prayer and cried over her and went down to the beach and was sad for  a little bit. You know, I knew it was going to happen, but had I not won that reward  challenge, I was going to take her down in the woods and run with her and  hide. <br/>I just don't trust Sash,  you guys, I'm sorry. I'm just gonna be honest with you guys. <br/>What do we do then? <br/>You have to remember  these guys were together all day yesterday, all night, and now they're  together. <br/>Here's what we have to  do. We have to make him think we trust him. We have to make him think, no matter what, that you and I will take him to  the finals and drop her. We need to make Sash think 100% that he's... See if he's still with us, which  he'll say he is, and we'll find out in the next tribal council. Yeah, it was an unbelievable mistake I made. I left Sash back at camp, the person I could trust least back at camp with  three other guys that are waiting to pounce on him. I couldn't help it. Damn, they're all talking to him. I knew they were talking to him. If Sash goes with them, then it's going to be me, Holly and Jane fighting for  our lives and it's going to be hell. It's going to be a fight to the finish if Sash goes with them. <br/>Look at these  fresh-looking ladies. How was it? <br/>It wasn't even a  shower. <br/>It had a water faucet. [indistinct conversations] I got up from the  table, I got up from the table... Chase, Holly and Jane  got back from their reward, and, you know, it sounds like they had a great  time, but I'm nervous. I'm nervous. There's a lot of variables that could play into this right now that are  pretty Dangerous just in terms of my name being brought up on the chopping  block just because, you know, I'm not really sure where I stand right now. I'm definitely a physical threat, as well. <br/>No, no. Nope. <br/>I haven't trusted Benry  this entire game. I think Dan, ben and Fabio are gunning for Jane, but I also think they're  gunning for me, as well. So I'm definitely worried that Sash would leave us and go with those guys,  but I'm going to try to do my damn best to make sure he feels real good with  our crew. <br/>Sorry I didn't take  you yesterday, man. <br/>Oh, no. Holly deserved it. We all would have taken Holly, you know, and I was just a little nervous when  you brought Jane with you, just because... I very much regretted  not taking you. <br/>Well, I appreciate  you saying that. <br/>But I wanted to show  you, too, I trust you coming back to camp with the guys. Did they talk to you at all, because I knew they were going to try to sway  you. <br/>Yeah, of course they  know that I'm the swing vote. <br/>I just know you gave  me your word that you were with us. <br/>I just wanted to make  sure just moving forward that we're trying to stay as strong as we can,  because if Jane makes it to the final, no matter who she brings, she's  winning it no matter what. <br/>I know that. You know I know that. But my thing is, are you talking about taking you to the final three? <br/>Yeah, what I'm  saying, will you swear on your mother and your wonderful father, I know you  would never... Would you be willing to not vote me out and that whether it's  the final three or the final two that you would take me no matter what? <br/>Yes. <br/>I was worried about  yesterday. <br/>We all talked about  it and we were nervous sending you back with the guys. <br/>I was like, please  don't let them talk him into switching teams. <br/>Of course they want  me to jump on board with them. <br/>Benry told me he  wants to keep playing this game with me and that he wants Fabio out next. <br/>No, that's not...  That's a straight-up lie. <br/>I think Benry should  go next because he's the most to win immunity. You said earlier you don't think so, Fabio. <br/>Well, either or. It is going to depend on the challenge. What if he wins the challenge tomorrow? <br/>Sash is back there  talking to Chase and Holly together. <br/>Dangerous? <br/>Yep. But our plan is doomed. <br/>You know, it was  originally me, Dan, Fabio and Sash that were going to go in and pick these  guys off one by one, Holly, Jane and Chase, but you can't trust Sash. I don't trust Sash. But I have a pretty good relationship with mama Holly, and Chase is my boy  since day one. You know, so we'll see if I can end up confiding in them and create myself a  new alliance. So I definitely, you know, I found a way to save my ass. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Come on down. <br/>We're talking Fabio. <br/>Let's get on the same  page. <br/>Well, we're thinking  you talked to him earlier. Did you tell him? I think Fabio should be the next. <br/>I'm fine doing that,  as long as I stay, dude. Just keep me in the loop. I want to make it one more tribal council. <br/>And just like I told  you guys, I'm not sure... Would you vote him  out? <br/>Well, he has to go  eventually if I want to make it to the end, so hopefully Fabio doesn't win  individual immunity. That's extremely Dangerous for me if he does, obviously. <br/>Why? <br/>Well, I mean, I don't  know. I don't know what your obligations to Jane are, but I don't think any of you  want to end up in the top three with Jane. <br/>Right. <br/>So either Jane or Fabio  next? <br/>I came over and I  talked to Chase and Holly for a little bit, and, you know, they have no  problem voting out Fabio. I'm not sure if they're beating around the bush, if they were talking about  me when I was walking up. Sash was in on the conversation, as well, and I let him know that as long as  I'm not going home, you know, I really don't have a problem voting Fabio out. I know it would be breaking up my alliance a little bit, but it's amazing. It's crazy what a couple hours can do around camp. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: Jane, first  things first, I will take it back. Thank you. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will be attached to a hitching rail. On my go, you'll maneuver over and under the hitching rail, releasing rope as  you go. When you think you have enough rope, you'll attempt to grab a bag of gold  coins. The first three to get their bag of coins move on to the final round. For the final round, you must solve a gold coin puzzle. The first person to get it right wins immunity, is safe at tribal council and  guaranteed a one in six shot at winning the money. Losers go to tribal council. Somebody will be voted out. Worth playing for? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: All right,  we'll draw for spots. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. First three to get their bag of gold coins moves on to the next round. Survivors ready? Go! Benry and Fabio throwing themselves over these hitching rails. Sash right in there. When you think you have enough rope to reach the gold bag, give it a shot. If you're wrong, you got to go back and get more rope. Got to get on to the next round to have a shot at immunity and only three  people will move on. Here goes Fabio. Does he have enough rope to get there? Plenty to spare. Fabio moving on to the final round. Sash now going to give it a go. Benry now giving it a go. Sash is short. Benry's short. You need to pick it up now. This is going to be over quickly. Jane now heading out. Does she have enough rope? Jane's going to be short. Jane, Benry and Sash fighting for that second and third spot. Benry giving it a go. Sash right behind him. Benry moving on. Sash moving on. All right. In the final round, Benry, Fabio, Sash. Survivors ready? Go. We have given you three stacks of gold coins to begin with. You have ten other sacks of gold coins to figure out where they go. When you're finished, you will have a rectangular shape of gold coins. <br/>Come on, guys. Y'all can do it. <br/>Jeff: Been out here  32 days. How sharp is whatever is left of your mind? Some people really excel at puzzles like this. Others, like me, do not. Benry all over the place. <br/>Come on, Benry. You can do it. <br/>Jeff: Fabio making  very little progress. <br/>Come on, Fabio. <br/>Jeff: Sash making  progress on his puzzle. <br/>Come on, Sash. <br/>Shut up. <br/>Were you a  cheerleader in high school? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: The puzzle is  already difficult. This could conceivably be a million dollar challenge for one of the three of  you. <br/>Man, I have no  freaking clue. <br/>Jeff: Benry about  ready to give up. Fabio now studying Sash's puzzle looking for some help. If Sash is right, he's making some progress. Fabio now starting to figure it out. Fabio and Sash neck and neck right now. Fabio getting closer. Sash is very close. Immunity on the line. Tribal council tonight. Got to close the box to finish. Sash wins immunity. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: Sash, come on  over. Congratulations. <br/>Way to go, Sash. <br/>Jeff: Sash guaranteed  a one in six shot at winning the money. Safe tonight at tribal council. As for the rest of you, after 32 very tough days, one of you going home  tonight. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I'll see you at tribal. Congratulations. <br/>Thanks, jeff. <br/>I pulled out the win  today. It feels great. Right now I'm a triple threat, individual immunity, the hidden immunity idol,  and I'm in the majority alliance. So at this point, I'm in complete control. I can't wait for the final tribal council to win my million. <br/>All that brain work. <br/>My head was hurting  just watching you guys. <br/>Most of the  challenges I've been sand bagging, going maybe 70%, 80%, and now I look at  people like Benry and Fabio, who have been going 110% every challenge, and  the reason why they probably won't make it to the final is because they are a  physical threat to win the final immunity challenge. <br/>Will you let them...  Will you let me know if my name comes up? <br/>Yeah. Yes. <br/>I just got an uneasy  feeling this morning and then, you know, I just think that Chase feels that  he's really close to Benry, so if they wanted to pull something, I feel like  it would be on me. Does that make sense? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Because if they're  going to want to do something, they have to have you. So you're going to hear it either way. You can let them think you'll go along with what they say or whatever, but  please let me know. <br/>I'll give you guys  the inside scoop. <br/>My instincts tell me  that Sash is still a bit of a swing vote, you know, but he's closer to me  than anybody on the tribe, so if he's in the middle of a swing vote, and it's  my name on the other side, he's going to tell me, I feel like. <br/>Let's just ask Dan  what he wants to do. <br/>I feel like sitting  back right now and being cool is part of it, you know? We'll see, though. You know, it's hard to tell and... We'll see, man. <br/>Hey, man. <br/>What's up? <br/>Who are you thinking? <br/>I don't know. Who are you thinking? <br/>As far as I know,  everyone... Everyone has been saying Fabio. <br/>That's what I thought. <br/>It's easy then. <br/>Okay. You got it? <br/>I guess so. Right now Chase and I are stringing along Fabio, Benry and Dan into thinking  different things of who is going home tonight. Right now the two names on the chopping block are Fabio and Benry. My stomach is messed up. So they really have no idea what's going on. I'm going to keep them guessing until I feel like telling them, or not  telling them. <br/>Jane. Jane. <br/>What up? <br/>Do you think he'll  buy that? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I don't think so. <br/>Why? <br/>I think it's better  to tell him that we're going to vote off Holly. <br/>I'll do whatever. <br/>Sash, are you willing  to do that? <br/>Huh? <br/>Can you do that? <br/>What? <br/>Just convince Fabio  that me, you and Dan are going to vote Holly? <br/>I feel guilty for  lying, but as long as it's not me going home next and everybody agrees that,  you know, they'll vote off Fabio, I think it will be pretty simple to pitch  to Fabio that we want to get Holly out of here, and I don't think he'll buy  the whole Jane thing just in terms of Chase and Jane being so close, so as  long as I'm not going home tonight, I'll do whatever it takes to stay here  for one more night. <br/>Sash said he would  vote Holly. Dude, he realizes what's good for him in terms of alliance-wise. <br/>Holly or Jane? <br/>Holly. <br/>Holly? I'll vote Holly. <br/>Me, you, Dan and Sash  are going to vote Holly. <br/>And then Chase? <br/>I haven't talked to Chase. As long as us four vote Holly, we're good. <br/>Stick to that and we  don't have to do much politicking. <br/>Then the day is  mellow. We lay low. <br/>Yeah, I was feeling a  little worried earlier. I wasn't sure if my name was being thrown around or this and that. It made sense for them to want to get me out, I thought, so I feel good about  getting Holly out, you know. I think she's overstayed her welcome almost. She's getting a little bit... I'm just I'm ready for her to go. <br/>Ready to go another  seven days out here? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Me too. <br/>I mean... I don't know what I'd  do if you weren't out here. You really are like a second mom to me. <br/>Well, I'm going to  tell you what, best thing that ever happened was I got picked before. Really. <br/>Well, it really means  a lot to me that you're out here and that you trust me enough that we can  work together. So just know that I have your back, okay? <br/>I got yours. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I feel real good  because I think our four-way alliance is going to stay strong and hopefully  our four, which is Chase, Holly, Sash and me will be in the final four. <br/>Now that I know I  have Chase, you and Holly... We got four good  people. <br/>I think we all fell  in place because we all know that we're loyal, sincere and that we're just  good people. <br/>Yes, yes. <br/>You can't backstab  someone who you have lots of love for. <br/>No. <br/>You can't backstab my  mom, can't backstab my second mom. <br/>Okay. All right, all right. Let's go. I really and truly think Sash has a great heart and Sash is not going to go  with them. Sash is guaranteed final four with us. I mean, we're not going to vote him out. Fabio and Benry have been a physical threat since day one. Always have, always will. So either Benry or Fabio is going home tonight. Holly, Chase and I, we never planned this in the beginning. We just came together and ended up meshing. And it's like spokes on a wheel. We're just turning the clock right now. Turning the clock. And hopefully we'll get to pick them off one by one because that's what they  planned to do to us. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring  in the members of our jury. Alina, Marty, Brenda, and our two quitters, NaOnka and Purple Kelly, who quit  at the last tribal council. Let's talk about the reward, Chase. Part of the reward challenge was choosing two people to go with you. <br/>Right. <br/>Jeff: On one hand,  great strategic opportunity to make a couple of people very happy. On the other hand, you leave four other people behind. How concerned are you that that can work against you? <br/>I was pretty  concerned it would work against me. I mean, you got two people you're making happy, four people you're making mad. That's not good. But I had to choose two people. <br/>Jeff: Chase,  concerned at all that just due to being young and fit that you're a threat  right now because you could conceivably win your way to a spot at the final? <br/>Yeah, I'm a physical  threat, but at the same time, I haven't won individual immunity yet. I think it's clear Fabio, Benry and I are the three biggest physical threats  here. So it's definitely something that weighs on your mind. Gets you a little bit nervous. <br/>Jeff: Benry, where  are you at in terms of being concerned you're too much of a physical threat? <br/>I'm extremely  concerned. There's no doubt in my mind that these guys think I'm a threat, and it  concerns me a little bit for sure. <br/>Jeff: Jane, when you  look at somebody like Fabio and you compare him to you with these challenges  coming up, how big of a target do you put on his back? <br/>Well, he's definitely  a lot stronger, a lot more built, faster, maybe not the smartest on the  puzzles, but as far as being a physical threat, oh, yeah, he's a big physical  threat. <br/>Jeff: Fabio, what do  you do to keep the target off your back? You can't change your age or your physical ability. <br/>I stay friendly with  people around camp. I talk to everybody. I make sure they know that I'm pretty honest and open. I have to trust my alliance to, you know, get me further in the game and  those people that I have told the whole game I've trusted, you know, we'll go  further in the game together. <br/>Jeff: Benry, we're  getting down to it now, right? This is where the big moves are going to happen. How confident are you that it will swing your way? <br/>I'm pretty confident  that it will swing my way tonight. <br/>Jeff: Sash, great  night to have immunity around your neck. <br/>It's the first time  I've come with immunity around my neck. It is a great feeling. It gives me a clearer idea coming into tribal. Because as soon as you have this around your neck, it seems like people like  to talk to you more. The more people talk to you in this game, the better you probably are. <br/>Jeff: Fabio, did you  see people approaching Sash? <br/>Yeah, I did,  definitely. All you have to do is hang around camp and watch who goes off and talks and  this and that, but I wasn't worried. <br/>Jeff: Holly, did you  see people approaching Sash today? <br/>Yes, I did. <br/>Jeff: Does that  concern you? <br/>Well, I think it  concerns everyone. <br/>Jeff: It doesn't  concern Fabio. He just said. <br/>Well, I feel sorry  for him then. You have to talk to people. You have to find out what's going on. If you just sit back and watch, you might not be furthering yourself in the  game. So communication is huge. <br/>Jeff: Well, it sounds  like tonight's vote will determine which alliance holds strong and which  alliance falls apart. Sash, you have the necklace. I assume you're keeping it? <br/>I'm going to hold on  to it tonight. <br/>Jeff: Cannot vote for  Sash. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Dan, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it, now would be  the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote Holly. Fabio. One vote Fabio. Fabio. Two votes Fabio. One vote Holly. Benry. One vote Benry. Benry. We're tied. Two votes Benry, two votes Fabio, one vote Holly. Benry. That's three votes Benry, two votes Fabio, one vote Holly, one vote left. 12th person voted out and the sixth member of our jury: Benry. You need to bring me your torch. Benry, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Jeff: Coming into  tribal council, everybody trusted their alliance. Leaving tribal council, not so much. And therein lies the tricky part of alliances, realizing when you can no  longer trust them. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on: Survivor. Come on in guys! With only two episodes left, the stakes are higher than ever. Sash, I'll take back the necklace. And at the challenge the winners get enough luxury to keep them strong until  the end. <br/>Oh, man. And as for the losers... They will be taken and executed. <br/>I'm extremely  surprised. I just got straight blindsided. Not what I was expecting coming into this tribal council. I'm definitely going to have to assess who masterminded this idea of sending Benry  home. I guess the other six remaining members see me as a threat. I guess I have to take that some what as a compliment.
