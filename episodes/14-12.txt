<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor:  That was brilliant. <br/>Probst: With the four horsemen's alliance broken, Alex and Mookie were on the  outs. <br/>We are six strong, and there's two people just waiting on death row. <br/>Probst: In a desperate attempt to save their necks, Alex and Mookie searched  through Yau-Man's bag. <br/>Yeah, he got it. <br/>Probst: And discovered his hidden immunity idol. <br/>Just cause some hell, man. If I'm going down, I'm bringing hell with me. <br/>Probst: When Alex and Mookie confronted Yau-Man...  What do you want to do, Yau? <br/>You guys do what you need to do. <br/>Probst: ...he decided to tell everyone about the idol. <br/>I thought that was a little dirty, but I will have to tell all my voting bloc  straight out. They went through my bag. <br/>They went through your bag, Yau-Man? <br/>Yeah, they went through my bag. <br/>Alex went through Yau-Man's things and threatened him. They said, "I know you have the immunity idol."  Finding out that Yau-Man had the immunity idol changed a whole bunch of stuff  because everybody with the immunity idol is considered dangerous. <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge... Mookie connects! ...The tribe was split into two teams. Dreamz has it! Green wins reward! Dreamz secured victory for himself, Stacy, Earl and Alex. Boo, head on out. And they sent Boo to Exile Island...  "The idol is back at your very own beach."  Probst: ...Where he discovered the first clue to a newly hidden immunity idol. <br/>It's not here. It's not my beach. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge...  D-4. <br/>Probst: D-4 is a hit. Alex out. Stacy wins individual immunity. ...Stacy came out on top. Stacy, safe from tonight's Tribal Council. You are not. There's somebody going home. There's somebody going home. Back at camp: Back at camp: Fearing that Alex or Mookie could easily stumble  upon the newly hidden immunity idol, Boo convinced his alliance to split  convinced his alliance to split their vote. their vote. Earl and Yau-Man, however, were Earl and Yau-Man, however, were uneasy with  the plan. uneasy with the plan. <br/>Going into tonight's Tribal Council split vote worries me very much. I really... rather not see it. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council... You cannot vote for Stacy. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. Alex, you're up. ...in a last-ditch effort to save himself, Alex turned on Mookie and helped  vote him out. The 11th person voted out and the fifth member of our jury: Mookie. Mookie. Mookie, the tribe has spoken. Mookie, the tribe has spoken. Well, based on what I heard tonight, Alex is either odd man out or suddenly  very valuable. Seven are left. Seven are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Tonight's vote was pretty important for me. I know Mookie voted for Boo. I know Mookie voted for Boo. I voted for Mookie. I voted for Mookie. <br/>My vote for Mookie is what saved my ass, basically. I was like, I'm gonna write down his name, go with my gut. So I'm still here. [laughs] [laughs] Yup, still here. Yup, still here. <br/>I would have preferred Alex would go. Alex is more of a threat, but for some strange reason, they wanted to split  the vote between Mookie and Alex, and no one considered the fact that, hey,  did you ever think that Mookie and Alex have a vote? That they might vote for each other? Duh. <br/>I don't want there to be, like, some kinda rift between you and I. I'm willing to say if I'm wrong, I'm wrong. <br/>Whatever. You know. It's not that big a deal. After Tribal Council, Stacy approached me, you know, trying to clear things  up, telling me how she wants to be friends with how she wants to be friends  with me after this. Like I care. me after this. Like I care. me after this. Like I care. <br/>So I understand...  So I understand...  Who's "everybody?"  Everybody besides you and Alex. <br/>At this point, they're all stressing out. Obviously, they're not all in agreement. That always creates room and opportunity. <br/>Why am I... Why are y... What's going on? <br/>We're asking you a question. <br/>I don't know. <br/>No, because Boo came over and he's like, "Everybody wants to talk to  you."  He just wants to know. <br/>My best bet was to just lay low, observe, let them get at each other a little  bit. From this point forward, I think I'm gonna have to play this game with a  smile, you know, velvet gloves and a know, velvet gloves and a dagger in my  pocket. dagger in my pocket. dagger in my pocket. [theme song playing] [theme song playing] âª  I definitely feel like I'm on the chopping block still. So after last night, I decided I'm going into ninja mode and it started this  morning, right? I woke up. I could have gone up, you know, gone around, done my business as I normally  do, but instead I just kinda laid there and just kinda listened, tried to  see, okay, who's still here? Who's still at the campfire? Like, it's all about observation for me, and I'm trying to make sure I'm not  seen or heard, sure I'm not seen or heard, kinda like a ninja right now. kinda like a ninja right now. <br/>Yau I trust 100%. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I only trust Yau and you 100%. 100%. <br/>Oh, okay. Good. <br/>Oh, okay. Good. <br/>Dreamz has been proving himself. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>You know, he can be a little rogue at times with his strategy. <br/>I'd look into that. I always felt that I could rely on Dreamz. <br/>The core alliance is myself, Cassandra and Yau, but me and Cassandra talked  about taking Dreamz to the top four. Then we can just have the, the core four. That's what they're called, That's what they're called, the core four. the core four. <br/>I mean, honestly, my concern is you and Dreamz are tight. I mean, I don't see you voting I mean, I don't see you voting him out... him  out... So I'm, just saying, mathematically, I'm off to my mathematically, I'm  off to my thing, you know. thing, you know. Earl and I have a major disagreement as to who the top four should be. His idea of the top four is myself, Earl, Cassandra and Dreamz. That is a very bad top four for me to get to the next stage because Cassandra  and, and Dreamz are very close. I would like a very weak candidate up there, but the very weakest is Stacy, I  know. I hate the idea; I really do. I wish it was Michelle. I would like to see the top four as myself, Earl, Cassandra and Stacy because  then I have a chance of getting to the top a chance of getting to the top  three. three. <br/>I trust Yau-Man, but Yau-Man is definitely playing the game for himself. Yau has immunity idol, and so I think Yau-Man is a real big threat. I know he's playing the game and he's playing the game hard. He's playing it like street He's playing it like street ball: he's playing it  to win it. ball: he's playing it to win it. ball: he's playing it to win it. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! How's everybody doing on day 31? <br/>We all are tired out here. <br/>Hungry. <br/>Probst: Hungry? Hungry plays in nicely to today's challenge. Shall we get to it? <br/>Yes. <br/>Do it! <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, you are going to rip pieces of meat off a  large piece of pork using only your teeth. Each time you get a mouthful, you'll drop it in your plate. Whoever has the most meat on their plate at the end of five minutes wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Tomorrow the winner and the first two runners-up will be picked up by  helicopter, flown to one of the most beautiful places in Fiji. Then you will river-raft the rain forest. <br/>Oh... wow! <br/>Probst: It is truly spectacular. You'll then have a nice lunch, come back to camp. In addition, the winner of this challenge will send one person to Exile  Island. Finally, the winner of this challenge will also receive an advantage in the  next immunity challenge. Take your spot. We'll get your hands tied behind your back and we'll get started. Here we go. For reward and an advantage in the next immunity challenge. Survivors ready? Go! You got five minutes to tear off as much pork as you can and get it on your  plate. There are no lanes. This is a free-for-all. Dreamz and Earl getting a good, quick start. Alex with a nice big piece. Yau-Man, Boo, Cassandra working together. Nobody working with Alex. Boo with a hugepiece. Yau-Man with a nice big chunk. <br/>Cassandra. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man looking for some help from Cassandra. You need two people. One to hold it steady. One to tear it off. Dreamz with another big piece. Alex in it. Cassandra still in it. Alex staying in it. Yau-Man with a hugechunk! Earl picking it up off the dirt. Yau-Man and Boo working together using their shoulder, using their chins. Yau-Man with another huge chunk of pork. Boo gets a big chunk. Boo is in it. Cassandra is in it. Yau-Man is in it. Alex with another big piece. It's going to be very close. One and a half minutes left in One and a half minutes left in this challenge. this challenge. Dreamz is in it. Dreamz is in it. Alex not giving up. Alex not giving up. 15 seconds. Whatever is in your mouth when I call time also counts. Five, four, three, two, one, stop! That's it! Whatever you have in your Whatever you have in your mouth, put on your plate. mouth, put on your plate. Start with Boo. Boo weighs in at 8.9 pounds. Boo, take a spot right up here. For now, you are in first place. Yau-Man weighs in at six pounds. Yau-Man, currently in second place. Cassandra comes in at 5.8 pounds. Take a spot up here, Cassandra. Stacy in at 4.3 pounds. You can stay there. Earl, not enough. Five pounds. Dreamz at six pounds also. Dreamz, you replace Cassandra. One plate left. If this is under six pounds, If this is under six pounds, you're out of the  reward, Alex. you're out of the reward, Alex. It is not going to be enough. Boo wins the challenge. <br/>Finally! <br/>Probst: Yau-Man and Dreamz, first runners-up. You're going along with him on the reward. All right, Boo, first order of business. Since you won the challenge, you earn the right to send one you earn the  right to send one person to Exile Island. person to Exile Island. <br/>Earl, I know you don't take hard feelings to this. I'm going to send you back. <br/>Probst: Head on out. Boat will pick you up. You'll be back in time for the next immunity challenge. Boo, this is your advantage for the next immunity challenge. You can ponder how that might come into play. It will all make sense at the next challenge. All right, guys, head back to All right, guys, head back to camp. camp. <br/>Here it comes. <br/>That's the one right there. Get a helicopter ride! All right, ladies and gentlemen, keep the camp safe. We'll do what we can do. <br/>You guys have fun. <br/>I won the reward challenge yesterday, along with Boo and Dreamz, and we start  out the day with a helicopter ride. I've never been on a helicopter. Very excited. <br/>Fly like the birds. <br/>I know. Right? <br/>Wow! This is so cool! <br/>For real. <br/>I'll be back! <br/>Being in a helicopter flying was truly amazing flight for somebody like me  who grew up on islands like this, and to see it from the air was just an  amazing experience. <br/>Now we're going through the rain forest. <br/>Wow! We're living la vidalarge! <br/>How much you think it cost to rent one of these? I wouldn't mind spending, like, $600 or $700 on a really nice date. I'd do it big like that, Dreamz. <br/>There's Exile Island right there. <br/>What's up, Earl? What's up, Earl? Holy moley! I still can't believe it. We rolling up in here, folks! We rolling up in here, folks! Oh, this is comfortable. Oh, this is comfortable. <br/>During the reward, Boo was talking a lot, just trying to be... I don't know. He was just talking too much. <br/>Hello. Can you hear me, Dreamz? Hello. <br/>It's relaxing time, you know? It's time to chill. We won this. Let's relax. Let's live it up. It's just annoying. <br/>I'm hungry. We're going whitewater rafting, the most beautiful place in Fiji. <br/>Oh, wow! What a ride! It was just unbelievable. And about an hour and a half into the trip, the helicopter landed, and we had  to hike for about ten minutes to get to the river. <br/>So, personally, you guys, I want to welcome you guys. The name of this river is the Apananuli. Secondly, it's really fast and so strong. <br/>So we were given a little safety briefing, and we got into a raft with the  river guide, and then we went down guide, and then we went down this rapids. this rapids. <br/>Then we went whitewater rafting. Probably never do it again, but it was so fun. And I wish I could take my family or somebody on a trip like that so they can  experience what I experienced. <br/>Look at that! Waterfall. Now, that's a waterfall. <br/>It's like a field trip for grown people. <br/>We're floating around in a postcard here. You cannot get better than this. I told myself ten times, "Look at this. Take it in. Look where you're at." I am absolutely dumbfounded. I mean, I'm tickled pink. I feel like a little girl. I feel like a little girl. <br/>This is great. <br/>This is great. <br/>This is what I came here for. "Clue number two: Your normal winding paths you'll walk. It's inside a tree near a lonely tower of rock." I'll figure it out. I think two clues will be enough for me. Can't wait to get back to camp to go looking for that idol. to go looking for that idol. It would be all worth it. It would be all worth it. <br/>Oh, is that caviar? Oh, this is good beef. <br/>That is awesome! <br/>Look at that! <br/>That's impressive, Dreamz. <br/>We finally got to lunch, it was just so much stuff. And I just kept eating it. We were back at camp living like cavemen in the dirt, having nothing, and  living like a broke, homeless guy, to living like you're rich. <br/>The best, best part is, at the end of the lunch, our river guide came over  and gave each guide came over and gave each of us an envelope. of us an envelope. And in the envelope are letters from home. <br/>"Dear Daddy, Miss you so much. I got six "A"s and one "B" in algebra on my report  card." Why can't you get a "B" in Spanish or something? Man! Yeah! <br/>I'm going to read mine. "Hey, Boo, your dad and sister are doing really well. Your dad's horses are eating well. Dad's kids are eating well also." Everybody is eating well. See, my family thinks... Thanks, Mom. Oh, what a bonus, huh? Am I crying yet? How you doing, Dreamz? You all right? <br/>When I read my sister's letter, you know, she said a lot of deep stuff. She was saying that she never thought that one of us would have a chance, a  opportunity. She thought it was over for the family. You know, she thought that our opportunity was up until, you know, I had the  opportunity to come here, and it really touched me that it was me that had  the opportunity to come, you know? <br/>Dreamz! <br/>It lets me know that she still believes in me even if I don't believe in  myself, so it really brought a lot out of me. It lets me know that my fight is just beginning. I know what I got to do now. I remember my purpose here. <br/>This is the best reward yet, you guys. <br/>It's the best yet. <br/>It's the best yet. <br/>Awesome! <br/>Awesome! <br/>My mom said, "I know you can make a good situation out of anything. You can't get tired of people."  But, with Boo, you get tired of him. He talks more than the girls talk. <br/>I'm not really tired of him. <br/>I'm not really tired of him. It's just the talking. It's just the talking. <br/>During the helicopter ride, Boo just almost spoiled the trip for us. He definitely just talks too much. Why don't you stop saying stupid stuff? <br/>He's been like that since day one. <br/>I cannot handle any more. I'm not going to lie to you people. I cannot handle any more. I'm losing it. Boo has been irritating enough to where I don't think these people want Boo  to get the $1 million. So, if somebody starts Boo bashing, I'm going to feed the fire. I cannot deal anymore. Sorry, guys. If I hear something stupid, I may call it out, and it may cause friction. People are not going to want to see certain people win and, right now, I  don't see Boo winning a popularity contest, so if I can help steer things in  an anti-Boo campaign, I am in an anti-Boo campaign, I am all for it. all for it. <br/>I never liked Boo, and I want Boo gone before Alex. Alex is still fighting strong, so I'm still making plans with Alex. So, point-blank, I'm just not So, point-blank, I'm just not going to let Boo  win. going to let Boo win. <br/>I'm going to try my damnedest, you know that. You do the same. If Boo wins immunity today, I think I'm pretty much screwed. Boo has a full belly and an advantage in the next immunity challenge. But I need to keep myself alive in this thing, so I am focusing all of my  energy, all of my all of my energy, all of my willpower on the challenge. willpower on the challenge. willpower on the challenge. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Earl, returning from Exile Island. <br/>Bula. <br/>Bula Bula. <br/>Great to see you. <br/>Welcome back, Earl. <br/>Probst: Are you guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Probst: First things first, Stacy, take back immunity. Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. All right, at the last reward challenge, Boo, you won an advantage in today's  immunity challenge. Did you bring it with you? <br/>Yes, I did. <br/>Probst: Those are climbing steps, and they are a big part of today's  challenge. Boo, because you already have your steps, you do not have to participate in  the first round of this challenge. You move on to the final. For the rest of you, on my "go," you will race to dig up your three  climbing steps that are buried in the sand. When you have all three, you race to the finish. The first two people to get their climbing steps join Boo in the final. For the final round, you will use those climbing steps to help you get to the  top of a 12-foot pole. First person to get to the top, grab their flag, wins immunity, stays alive  in this game. For the rest of you, after 33 days, somebody will be going home tonight at  Tribal Council. Make sense? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: We'll draw for spots, we'll get started. All right, here we go. First two people to finish join Boo in the final round. Survivors, ready? Go! You're looking for three paddle steps buried in different places in  everybody's lane. Alex going after it, on a tear. Cassandra barely making a dent in that sand. Yau-Man making his way down the course. Is he deep enough? Dreamz has his first paddle step! Alex tearing up a lot of sand, no luck. Coming back to a new spot. Cassandra, digging like a small rabbit, as if it's going to be buried one to  two inches. Yau-Man trying a very interesting method-- hugging that sand. Dreamz has his second climbing step. Stacy digging but finding nothing. Alex has a huge hole. Still no climbing step. Pick up the pace! You can rest later! Or you can rest tomorrow, just not at the beach. Dreamz has his third climbing step. Dreamz moving on to the final round with Boo. One more person moving on. Yau-Man has his first climbing step. Now Yau-Man knows how deep they are. Alex has his first climbing step. You're looking for three total. Alex getting all of the sand out of his lane and moving most of it out onto  Yau-Man's course. Yau-Man putting his sand back in Alex's lane. Alex has his second climbing step. Alex now with two climbing steps. Yau-Man has one. Cassandra just waiting for it to be over. Alex has his third climbing step. And with that, Alex moves on to the final round with Boo and Dreamz. For the final round, we have Boo, Alex, and Dreamz. First person to stand on top of the post and grab their flag wins immunity. Survivors, ready? Go! Boo up quickly. Alex right behind. Boo skipping several cleats. Alex scaling to the top! Can he pull it off? Boo is up there! Boo wins immunity! <br/>Yeah! Yeah! [cheering]  Probst: That's three people who desperately wanted immunity. That is not the easy way to do this challenge. Boo not even waiting for an invitation. <br/>Give it to me, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Boo safe from the vote tonight. Yau-Man, Earl, Stacy, Cassandra, Dreamz, and Alex, somebody going home  tonight. somebody going home tonight. I'll see you at Tribal. I'll see you at Tribal. <br/>Fortunately for us, the person who we wanted to vote out today did not win  the immunity necklace, so... Alex will get voted out today. <br/>Can we sit here and say, well, everybody right now, Alex's name, please? <br/>No, I'm going to give him this necklace. <br/>I'll freakin' tackle you. That would be the greatest Tribal Council ever 'cause we'd be fighting all in  there. <br/>Today I'm feeling quite safe because we have all agreed that Alex is the odd  man out and needs to be taken out, so I'm feeling safe enough that I do not  think I will need to use my hidden immunity idol. <br/>The situation is grim. But, you know, I'm not going to approach these people with desperation. I'm not going to beg for my life. That's not the way it works for me. Right now, taking an aggressive approach to anything would be a bad idea,  especially given my position. I think the people that I need to talk to will talk to me. I think they'll approach me. I think I've earned enough of their respect they'll all at least want to say  something to me before tonight's vote. <br/>Hey, Alex. <br/>Hey, Cassandra. <br/>I hate to see you back down here by yourself. <br/>I'm okay. I'm just tired. <br/>You're just tired? I know we started out together...  Yeah, we did. <br/>Just relax. You should be very proud of yourself. We all are. <br/>Yeah, I tried to be a gentleman, you know. I tried to give it my all and do something that my kids could do something  that my kids could be proud of someday. be proud of someday. <br/>Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. That's true. Alex is trying his last effort to make a pitch to stay on longer, and he  presented a strong case. His argument was that Yau-Man has the idol, and he's going to take Boo and  Stacy with him because he knows, their personalities, people are not going to  vote for them to get the million dollars. It all started to make a little sense. I felt like, you know, Yau-Man is going to eventually have to leave, so why  not tonight? Maybe I'll be able to convince Maybe I'll be able to convince other people of  that. other people of that. <br/>I get nervous when I'm alone, you know. They're all talking about me. They're all talking about me. <br/>I don't think so. <br/>I don't think so. <br/>I anticipated this. So Alex is just trying to save his neck and say, "You guys should use my  vote. This is your only chance to take Yau-Man out." But you know what? I'd rather just vote your ass I'd rather just vote your ass off now, and I'll  risk it. off now, and I'll risk it. <br/>Alex was talking to Cassandra and Dreamz, and they seemed like they were  listening, but they weren't. I kind of like winked at them a couple of times. You know, you just play along with him. I don't think they're taking it I don't think they're taking it serious. serious. <br/>You really buying this? <br/>I'm buying it, but I'm like, then where does Alex fit in everywhere? <br/>He don't. That's the whole thing, he's gonna... after me, you and Earl, the whole plan,  regardless of what happens, it's me, you and what happens, it's me, you and  Earl getting to the top three. Earl getting to the top three. <br/>You know, Dreamz, like I told you from day one...  I really want to do that tonight. The plan was to get rid of Alex tonight, but Alex is my friend, and Yau-Man  has the immunity idol, and that makes him so dangerous. Yau-Man has already said that I was a big threat, so if he could put that  immunity idol into play, that means he goes to try to get rid of me. <br/>You're down with that? <br/>Yup. <br/>Cassandra, what do you want to do? <br/>I'm down with you, Dreamz. I told you from day one... I told you from day one...  And I'm like a freakin' follower. I follow Cassandra. <br/>If Cassandra's down with this, it's gonna definitely go through. <br/>It's pretty safe to say if I vote Yau-Man out, Stacy and Dreamz will more  than likely vote with me. And so, um, I definitely have a choice to make, either to vote Alex or  Yau-Man. And at this point right now, I'm very undecided. I'm not sure what I'm going to I'm not sure what I'm going to do tonight. do tonight. <br/>I'm writing down A-L-E-X. <br/>I'm writing down A-L-E-X. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Mm-hmm. I think Earl is very close to Yau-Man. There's no way he'd go for it. So in order to blindside Yau-Man, we definitely feel like we have to  blindside Earl at the same time. And so um, my head is telling me one thing, and my heart is saying another  thing. So I'm hoping that by the time it's time for Tribal Council, I'll have a  clear feeling exactly who I'm going to vote exactly who I'm going to vote for. for. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the jury. Rocky, Lisi, Michelle, Edgardo, and Mookie, voted out at the and Mookie,  voted out at the last Tribal Council. last Tribal Council. Alex, last Tribal Council, it was you or Mookie. <br/>Right. <br/>Probst: Mookie's over there. <br/>I'm definitely feeling the heat, Jeff. But I told these guys, if I'm going to be in this, you know me, I'm going to  fight to the very end. And for people who are sitting here you have to consider who you really want  next to you. And, you know, people forget alliances. Things are going to get very, very messy from this point forward whether I'm  here or not. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man, if something dramatic was going to happen, tonight's a good  name night for it. You got six people. Suddenly Alex becomes very valuable. Does that concern you? <br/>I've thought about that scenario, but because I have been with my alliance  for so long, I have decided that I can actually trust them up to this point. I can see maybe turning one, possibly two, but to be able to turn three over,  that's a very remote possibility at this time. I may be wrong, but I hope I'm not. <br/>Probst: Dreamz, do you believe that these six are as tight as they say? It's Alex tonight, that's it, and then tomorrow we deal with the six? <br/>It's definitely a possibility that he can swing three people, you know what I  mean. It's not totally out of the question. <br/>Probst: Alex, you obviously had to try to do something today. Do you lie down and die or do you start looking for cracks? <br/>I guess we'll find out  I guess we'll find out tonight, Jeff. tonight, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about the hidden immunity idol. Yau-Man, in some ways it represents safety. In other ways, you could be a target simply because you have it. <br/>I don't feel the pressure today, but the next round, I think I will feel the  pressure when the six original alliance members are going to look around for  somebody to vote out, they may decide to flush the idol out so that I cannot  use it for some nefarious purpose, so at that point I will have to really  keep my ears close to the ground and see what's going on. <br/>Probst: Alex, what kind of chatter has there been about the other hidden  immunity idol? <br/>With one immunity idol out and another one possibly on its way, I mean,  that's got to weigh in on people's minds. You can only use them tonight, the next Tribal Council and the one after that. That's three opportunities, two idols. You do the math on that. If it doesn't go down tonight, it's going down in the next couple of Tribal  Councils. So now or never. Maybe the next time might be now or never. You just never know. <br/>Probst: Are you surprised how unconcerned these six seem to be? <br/>I'm very surprised by it. I mean either they are completely 100% trustworthy or they haven't seen  enough of this game. I mean, if it really comes down to them six after this, they have to think  people are thinking more than one move ahead. It's very plausible. There are only a few days left.
