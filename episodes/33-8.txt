<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," at the Takali  tribe, Adam betrayed Taylor. <br/>I lied to you and I screwed  you. <br/>Figgy was the sacrifice that had to happen. <br/>Jeff: At the Vanua tribe, David and Zeke were growing  closer. <br/>Zeke, I trust you a lot. I think we're cut from the same cloth. <br/>Jeff: At the ika bula tribe, the millennials planned on  sticking together. But Jay wanted to make a big move. <br/>This decision could honestly mold the rest of my game. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Jay and will voted with the gen  xers. Seventh person voted out, Michaela. <br/>What? <br/>Jeff: Sending Michaela home. Michaela, the tribe has spoKen. Leaving Hannah in the dark. 13 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>That was hard, man. <br/>I know. She was mad, man. <br/>Told you, dude. I made a big-ass move tonight, and I thought I was going to get  punched in the face honestly, but Michaela's the closer. She closed on every single challenge, so I needed to do this  premerge just to be safe, and pretty proud of myself right now. <br/>I appreciate you guys  keeping us around. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I know. We didn't want her to be...  You know I would have voted with you all, though. <br/>But I didn't want you to do that. <br/>I just want you to know. At this point I’m clearly at the bottom of this tribe. I can't trust any of these people. Being completely excluded from a vote is a sure-fire way to  break trust and create enemies. Jay thinks I’m pathetic idiot that can't see past his pretty  face. <br/>You have to trust me. You have to tell me. I don't care about my hands getting bloody. <br/>Okay. Deal. <br/>I felt like a damn fool. I'm just plotting how to get back at them for not including me  in their game play. I hope I can get my revenge. I'm ready to play. <br/>I see it, Hannah. We're watching. We're waiting to see what it is. <br/>It's coming in this direction. <br/>What do they want? What is happening? <br/>Everybody settle down. <br/>What's going on in what's going on? <br/>Thank you, sir. <br/>All right. Let's go. Everyone gather around. <br/>Gather around. Gather around. <br/>Ika bula tribe urge you have five minutes to gather all  supplies you will need to survive for the rest of this game. Get on this boat. [cheering]  Yes, yes! <br/>That was music to my ears. I went from terrified that I was going home to now I’m at the  merge. Within 24 hours, I can't tell you how awesome that feels. Now the whole game is just opening up for me. Jay's word has been true so far, so maybe I can trust will and Jay. But yet I know I still have Chris, and I want the see what he's  been working on. <br/>We're in the staying here? <br/>Nope. <br/>Where are we going? <br/>I made the merge. To get to this point means so much. It really means the world. But this is when things start to get really serious. Like this is the point of the game where alliances and loyalties  are really tested. And the really great players get separated from the mediocre  players. And I hope that I’m in the former group. [ theme song playing]  Hey, look. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Are people coming in? <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>A merge. <br/>I’m so stoked. I was down on the bottom for so many days, like I didn't know  that I was going to make the merge, and here I am. The clouds have cleared. And I’m utterly thrilled. <br/>I’m a little nervous  because who knows who has made what connections at their other beach, but for  now I’m just excited to be here. <br/>We're back together again. <br/>Thank God. It's the merge. This is gigantic. To be back with the people that you originally trusted and that  you want to work with. It's huge. And Jay and Taylor, those are the relationships that I can take  to the end. So I’m back in the game. <br/>Hi, guys. <br/>Michelle. <br/>Congratulations, you have made the merge! [cheering]  Food. <br/>Let's eat. <br/>I’m super excited because  I’m back with Michelle, and I got tails back. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>But then I also got in my pocket, I got will and Hannah,  an I’m pretty sure Bret and Sunday. Besides that I got an idol in my back pocket, so I’m the  kingpin, but no one know, and I want the keep it that way. <br/>Do we want to go around and say where we come from, our  age, what we do in my name is Taylor, and I’m 24 years old, and I ema  snowboard instructor. <br/>Seeing everyone together, I have no idea who I can really  trust and who I cannot. I still truly trust Chris and Sunday the most. <br/>I’m Sunday. I'm older than all of you. <br/>Then I thought I might be able to trust Jay, but I saw  some millennials kind of coming together, laughing, all joking and, you know,  it got me a little nervous. So I don't know, man. We'll see. <br/>Oh, my God, Bret. <br/>We got the get Bret and Sunday back over. We get Bret and Sunday, we're good. <br/>Of course, a million things have happened. <br/>I haven't decided if the  merge is going to be a good thing or a bad thing for me. Everything was going really well at Vanua. We were on a roll. But the fact that there are two tribes and then a swap and now  we're back into this 13 and trying to figure out those relationships is  extremely difficult. Dave, Zeke and patriots are meshing pretty well. That's a pretty good core group right there to work with, and  then I want the regroup with Bret and Sunday and figure out what the next move  is. <br/>Hey, guys, congratulations on none of us being voted out. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I am delighted to see my  old nerdy pals Hannah anded a damp it's almost good that we got split up,  because I have intel from Vanua. Adam has intel from Takali, and Hannah has tapped in on the  intel from Jay attickic. <br/>So I go to tribal council and write down Bret's name and Michaela  writes down Bret's name, and then everyone flips on the two of us. <br/>Really? <br/>Led by...  Jay? Having my nerd voting bloc, I should be feeling great, but Jay  worries me. He's the locust of power right new because Jay is very charming. He looks at you with those deep brown eyes and he smiles the  surfer smile, and it's very enchanting. And it's making me nervous. I see all of the dudes, Ken and Chris and tay, everyone sort of  getting taken in by this Jay charm. <br/>How are you doing? <br/>Good. <br/>For real? <br/>Yeah. <br/>He sort of has this mystique that everyone is drawn  toward. He controls will outright. He probably controls Michelle. <br/>I used to live in newport  beach. <br/>Beautiful, man. <br/>I’m like, if this bro  alliance happens, I’m in trouble. <br/>We have a buried chest of awesomeness. <br/>When we first got here, I was worried there wouldn't be  enough food. There's way more than I thought there would be, way more. <br/>My philosophy here is that having a merge feast, it's  nice, it's fun, I like to eat, but do I need it? No. And almost every merge in Survivor, there's going to be a merge  idol out here somewhere. And I know this camp well. I was the only person that's been able to find an idol here. So if there is an idol out here, I feel like I may have a good  chance to actually find something. I take a will be at tree mail, I look up, and there's a note. I grab it. I open it up, but there's no idol. So I’m like, what's going on here? Congratulations. You have found an advantage that allows you to steal a reward  after it has been won by someone else. Wow. I know everything about this game, and this is certainly a  first. And it's exciting to be part of "Survivor" history. To have a new power that nobody has ever had in this game  before. Alert Jeff of your intention to steal after he has presented the  reward and before they leave the challenge area. <br/>I think I’m in one of the  best positions in this game and I have an idol. So I’m going to sit on this and use this on something that  really matters. <br/>I wake up in the middle  of the night and I get this idea. I'm like, I’m pretty good with mason jars and, you know, canning  stuff. So I pull a classic Survivor move. I grab a mason jar. I put so much stuff in there, I was like I’m going the try the  eat as much of that as I possibly can. That's my stash. <br/>In the middle of the night I hear clanging and the kid's  grabbing dry bananas. That's our food for the week. This is 13 people out here. You don't just jump in and start divvying up food for yourself. I don't want to be the one to say anything, so I go back the  bed. <br/>I wake up in the middle  of the night night and I see Taylor sneaking some food, so I decided it's an opportunity  to build trust with him. I'm going to have a midnight throw-down and talk some game. <br/>If I tell anyone about, this just vote my ass out. I'm not even hungry. I know you're pissed that Figgy is gone, and that's totally  understandable. <br/>Taylor is an incredibly unlikely ally for me. I have voted against his girlfriend twice and actually voted her  out, but if I can convince him to vote my way, then I've got control of this  game. <br/>Jay is building an arm and will has become Jay's  right-hand man. They're tighter honestly than you and him have maybe ever been. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>What if we voted out will? <br/>You would take out will? He has no choice but to go back the you, number one. <br/>Holy crap. Adam's trying to get will out. Are you dumb? Like I couldn't believe it. I don't want to work with Adam. He wrote my woman's name down, but Adam thinks that we are very  buddy buddy, and I want to keep it that way. <br/>Can I tell you a secret? <br/>What's up? <br/>I’m looking for an idol  today, and I found an advantage. <br/>Okay. <br/>It's never been didn't before. It says at any point I can steal someone's reward. <br/>A reward? <br/>Yeah. So if someone wins a loved one, I’m taking this reward. <br/>That's hilarious, dude. The only reason I’m telling you is because I want you to know I’m  serious about working with you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>That would not have been easier. I get all this intel from Adam, like I didn't really have to do  anything. I am a fan of the "Survivor" revenge, and so I want to  blindside Adam as best as possible. <br/>That's epic, dude. <br/>That's epic, dude. <br/>Somebody in the middle of the night. <br/>The mangoes had not been touched. I woke up, and there was maybe like a quarter to one-third left  in the drawer. That's terrible. <br/>It doesn't make any sense to me. <br/>I think we're getting  bamboozled. <br/>Thieves. <br/>I know. <br/>I’m starting to think  that we've underestimated the millennials' hold on each other and their  actual bond. I see a tight group over there. So I’m thinking we have to get one of them gone or we're in trouble. <br/>Michelle? <br/>Think about it, you, Sunday, me. <br/>He's ready to pounce. <br/>Taylor. <br/>Maybe. <br/>The tightest bonds in this game are Jay and Michelle and  will. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I agree. <br/>They're also dangerous players. <br/>So you guys are good with Taylor, right? <br/>That would be sweet. <br/>All right people are floating around the name Taylor. It seems like we're all on board with it. But it's so early. We're at a point in the game where everybody is trying to carve  out a path to final tribal. So there's going to be a ton of scrambling. People are going to start to get unsure, and that is when the  game gets crazy. <br/>What's up? <br/>I’m thinking to, what  extent will you vote out millennials? <br/>Me? I want to keep it strong right now. Because I know gen xers will target me and you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I want gen xers to flip  on their own so it's easy. <br/>Yeah. <br/>So we can get Adam the stay with us. Where does will stand at this point? <br/>Will's good. He's with us. We're so solid that group, no one is trading on anyone. <br/>How tight-lipped can you be? <br/>Super. <br/>Okay. Because if this gets back, then it's going to blow up in our  faces. <br/>Okay. <br/>Adam wants to gun for will. <br/>For will? <br/>For will. Don't tell will this? <br/>Adam wants the take out will now? <br/>Yes. <br/>Holy crap, dude. <br/>I know. <br/>I’m chilling. Tails comes to me and he's like, we need to talk. He's like, dude, Adam's gunning for will. And I’m like, what the hell is going on? Why is he going for will right now? That's dumb. <br/>Because he's convinced that he's your right-hand man? <br/>That will's your right-hand man. <br/>So that means he's gunning for me. <br/>Eventually, yes. And then it makes me think, okay, is it less of a risk to just  get him out right now? <br/>That's going to come out of left field. <br/>I know. And it's going to surprise him. <br/>I just heard Jay and Taylor  discussing getting rid of Adam. I'm like, oh, my God, this is not good. <br/>But if Adam gets spooked, this is going to blow up. <br/>We need the get will on board. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Right now Jay and his group are the most dangerous. So I was hoping to get this nerd alliance together, but if Adam  gets voted out, it will throw a wrench into my beautifully laid plan. <br/>It's going to get so crazy right now. <br/>Have you heard mine? <br/>Yeah. <br/>You have? From who? <br/>Adam. Because he knows that he's in the same position as he was when  we left this camp. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Adam's a rat. We need to get him out. But now I’m freaking out because if we can get the numbers, I’m screwed. So I’m starting to think to myself, I have to win immunity. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. You guys ready to get to your first individual immunity  challenge? <br/>Yeah. First things first, take back tribal immunity. Thank you, David, thank you, nick. Tribal immunity, no more. Individual immunity is now what you covet. With this around your neck, you are safe at tribal. Cannot be voted out. Without it, you're in trouble. For today's challenge, you're going to balance on a narrow  perch. Your hands will be tethered to a bucket above you. When your arms drop, you're out of the challenge. Last person left standing wins immunity, safe from the vote. Losers, you know the drill. Tribal council. Somebody will be the eighth person voted out of this game. Pick you spots. We'll get started. All right. Everybody in position? This challenge is on. The blasting from the past that has been updateed. A Survivor classic. Used to do it with one arm. That wasn't tough enough. So we decided to make it a little tougher for you guys. Both arms above your head. There really is very little wiggle room. If your arms drop just a little, that will be enough to tip your  bucket, an you'll be out of the challenge. Sunday is the first to move. Sunday first out of the challenge. No shot at immunity. Now you have an idea how sensitive it is. Not much wiggle room, right? <br/>Nothing. <br/>Jeff: Chris drops. Chris is the second person out of the challenge. Bret drops right behind Chris. Bret is now out. Survivor challenges are made to test, how far can you dig right  now to stay in this. <br/>Oh, come on. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: I hear a lot of grunting and groaning. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Jeff: You're not crazy. You're not weak. It's by design. This was improved to make it very tough. <br/>Come on. <br/>Jeff: Jay has been struggling for a while. Groaning at the pain. Jay drops out. Zeke falls off right behind Jay. Zeke is out of the challenge. We are down to eight. David has been moving a lot, but his arms are staying steady. Where are you feeling it, Adam? <br/>Nowhere, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Where are you feeling it, Jessica? <br/>I’m good, Jeff. <br/>I'll be honest where I’m feeling it. No one else is honest. I feel it in my arms and my back and my feet and my legs and my  toes. <br/>Jeff: You feel it in you face? <br/>I feel it everywhere. It's like pain everywhere. <br/>Jeff: Ken, the slightest bit of movement and his bucket  drops. That's how fast it goes. <br/>My arms are going numb. <br/>Jeff: You start daydreaming about something else and  you're drenched. Hannah can't take it anymore. Her bucket drops. Hannah now will take a spot on the bench. No shot at immunity. We're down to Taylor, Adam, David, Jessica, Michelle, and will. Everybody trying to put on a big game face. You don't want anybody to know that you're hurting, but you're  close to falling, because they might just be a little closer. So whatever you have in that tank, you need it now. <br/>Oh, Michelle. <br/>Jeff: Michelle is out of the challenge. And we are now down to five. This is about proving to yourself what you can do when pushed. Taylor is now out, and we are down to four left. David can't hold on any longer. And that leaves us with three. Adam drops out. We are down to two now. Jessica and will. One gen xer, one millennial, fighting for immunity. <br/>How you feeling, Jessica? <br/>I’m feeling fine. How are you, will? <br/>I’m doing amazing. <br/>Jeff: It would be so nice the go the tribal with that  necklace, certain that you aren't going home. Necklace, certain that you aren't going home. You've reached the one-hour mark. <br/>Wow. <br/>Nice work. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Jeff: Jessica, what would your kids say right now? <br/>My kids are going to be damn proud of their mom. I've always told them they can do anything, anything. <br/>My mom told me the same thing. <br/>You have a good mom. <br/>Yeah. Now I’m here here to prove it. Now I’m here here to prove it. <br/>This is crazy. <br/>Insane. <br/>It's incredible. <br/>Jeff: Can't be much feeling left in your arms, hands,  fingers, and every time you try to loosen them or get some feeling back, you  know you're risking tipping that bucket. You got to do it to get the feeling back. <br/>My legs are going. <br/>She's moving. <br/>Whoa. <br/>Jeff: After an hour and 30 minutes, Jessica drops. Will, the high schooler, wins first individual immunity. <br/>Yeah, willie. <br/>Nice job. <br/>Jeff: Wow. What a performance. <br/>I knew I needed it, so I just  kept pushing for it. <br/>Jeff: Will, come on over. <br/>Nice job, will. First individual immunity goes to will. Congratulations. I don't know what your friends back home in high school are  doing right now, but it definitely isn't this. You are safe tonight. As for the rest of you, after 23 days, your quest for $1 million  for one of you will fall short. Tribal council tonight. Somebody will be the eighth person voted out of this game. It will not be you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. Congrats. Good job. <br/>Unbelievable. <br/>My plan totally just blew up in my face, and I got to give  him credit. Will needed to win today, and he did. And so now I need to try to figure out another plan. <br/>Wow, you were unbelievable, man. I don't know how you did that. <br/>Incredible. <br/>That was amazing to watch. <br/>Nice job. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I can't believe that I,  the youngest person to ever play this game won the first immunity challenge. And what makes it even better is that I needed this one. Because I know that Adam had planned to try to vote me out of  this game. So he has to go. <br/>He was gunning for will. <br/>Jay? <br/>He has the numbers. Think about it. <br/>Are you still with him? <br/>Whatever you want? <br/>We get back and almost immediately, Jay turns around and  says, we're voting Adam out tonight. And my immediate reaction was, what? That's stupid. We have all these other people who would be great to go home. It seems like more than a personal move than a strategic move,  and I’m really worried we're making a huge mistake. <br/>Hey, I got some news for you, before we went to the  challenge, Taylor told Jay that you had been planning to vote out will. <br/>That's why will knew. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Will said, I know I’m a target. I knew it. As soon as he was up there for, like, three hours, I was like,  the kid knows. What went wrong? <br/>I laid the groundwork for  what I thought was a solid plan, and then the day of tribal council, it all  unraveled. So you're now Jay's target. But I think we can pull the votes together to get out Taylor. <br/>Taylor. <br/>I had a feeling I might  be playing too hard. I was playing too hard. Now I have to scramble. And at this point I’m willing to work with anybody on this tribe  if it will keep me in this game. <br/>I’m sorry I’m coming to  you right before tribal council. <br/>Whatever name you want, I’m putting down. <br/>I’m a little worried he  has an idol. He could give it to Taylor. <br/>Right. <br/>What needs to be broKen up is the upper echelon of the  millennials. That's Jay, Michelle, and Taylor. It is just a question of getting everybody on the same page,  because in the back of our minds, we're thinking, well, there are idols out  there, right? Here's what I think: Michelle is the safest person to go after  because she does not have an idol and they won't see it coming. <br/>She definitely doesn't have one. <br/>Exactly. <br/>Are you all right with that? <br/>We have the make a decision, guys. <br/>I need the gen xers to  get through this tribal council, but they're back and forth on who to vote  for, and if they can't get it together, then I need my plan "B,"  which is to see if I can get Taylor to target somebody else. <br/>Jay won't look me in the eye. It was too soon, and I had an information leak. <br/>So what do I do? <br/>I’m with you. <br/>At this point Adam has a good idea that his name has been  dropped, so he's scrambling. But it's too late, man. <br/>I will write anyone's  name down at this point. <br/>Tonight is 100% about revenge. Adam's responsible for Figgy going home. So now we're in the merge, and I got my boys back, and we're  coming to beat you up. <br/>Here's the scenario: He has an idol...  He doesn't have an idol. He's scrambling for one. <br/>It's so odd. It's like all these...  These conversations. <br/>When Adam walks off with Taylor...  You don't think Adam would flip on us, do you? <br/>We were going to talk to Adam. But I don't know if we can trust him. Then paranoia sets in and panic. That little seed of doubt can grow into a gigantic forest of  doubt. <br/>I’m nervous. Don't freak out too much. The vote will get screwed up, you know what I mean? <br/>Okay. <br/>I trust you. I don't trust them. <br/>I will check in with  those people, but if you keep pulling me aside, that's what's going to get me  in trouble. <br/>Adam's name is being thrown out there hard core. I knew this was going to happen because Adam decided he couldn't  just play the with the weirdoes. He had to sit at the cool kids table. <br/>Adam needs to go very soon. Adam is untrustworthy. Adam is a bad alliance member. <br/>I had been hoping to  preserve my nerd voting bloc, but Adam is the most frustrating person to  work. With I don't know what he's up. To now I’m thinking I should just vote him out. <br/>Hannah is telling me I just need to relax and that  everything is going to be okay. But I know for a fact that my position in this game is very  tenuous. <br/>I’m just happy. <br/>The good news is I have the hidden immunity idol. So I could play it, and I'll know I’m still going to be here  tomorrow. But if I use it and I have the numbers, I look like a chump. Oh, I don't know what to do. <br/>Jeff: So the millennials and gen x together, this is what  you wait for. David, what are some of the differences you noticed between the  mills mill and the gen xers? <br/>I think the millennials  eat allowed more food than the gen xers. Our feast food has been wiped out, pineapples and melons and  that's it. <br/>Jeff: He's clearly saying the gen xers didn't eat it. <br/>It was Taylor. [laughter]  But really I wasn't keeping it a secret. <br/>He wasn't keeping it a secret. <br/>You were open? <br/>I don't think I was  stealing. My stomach was super messed up. <br/>Jeff: Let me this a quick poll. Chris, how hungry are you? <br/>Hungry. <br/>Jeff: Jessica, hungry? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: Hannah? <br/>I could eat you. <br/>Jeff: So Taylor, clearly the point is everyone's hungry. <br/>Oh, yeah. Oh, definitely. <br/>Jeff: Chris, is this a difference between the millennials  and gen x. Even when it's clear everyone is calling him out, he's still  smiling, going, I know, it's kind of cool. <br/>Where I’m from, when you do something that you're thinking  of you're, it's called selfishness. That's a selfish move. Let's not get that confused with game play. <br/>It's not they was hungry. If I wake up and my stomach is freaking out, then, yes, I’m going  to do whatever I have to do george bush. <br/>Jeff: You're saying this was a medical emergency? <br/>Exactly, Jeff. <br/>Jeff, we all had medical emergencies that night. Some of us are still having medical emergencies. Where are our banana chips to help stop us? I mean, in a game for $1 million, you have to practice a little  delayed gratification because it might cost you $1 million down the line. <br/>Jeff: And yet, hand narcotic I don't even have to ask Taylor,  I can tell by his demeanor he's not the least bit concerned that he's on the  block tonight. <br/>He's a bro. <br/>Rock on, dude. <br/>Jeff: All right. So Adam, what is the vibe with a group of millennials and gen  xers, the majority of millennials, but you're all playing this individual  game. <br/>It's not just a majority of millennials. Yeah, there may be some loyalties from those first 12 days, but  there was also a period where we were in three different tribes getting to  know each other really well. And you can build loyalty during that time, as well. <br/>Jeff: David, Adam brings up an interesting point. When you switch tribes, it forces new relationships, and then it  makes you question the old ones. How much impact of have the switches had? <br/>I mean, the phase of the  game that we're in right now, it's similarly this: It's the people I trust  versus the people you trust. And so it doesn't really matter whether you're a millennial or a  gen xer, that's just secondary to really who do you trust. <br/>Jeff: Jay, does that ring true to you, that it really  isn't millennials versus gen x? <br/>I had tribal with will. When you find someone that's lil or trustworthy, you latch on to  that. So I’m going to stick by that. <br/>Jeff: But Michelle, that's what every person who has had  the torch snuffed thought or said right before they got it snuffed. Michaela just did it. Figgy never saw it coming. The list will go on and on. <br/>I’m going to agree with Jay  and will. Sometimes I wonder if it's the person you mesh with best,  someone you feel more friendly with. <br/>Jeff: So will, what's your take on tonight's vote? Is it going to be about a very clear objective, or is it  something else? <br/>There is definitely a clear objective in everybody's mind. The question is: What is the prevailing objective? <br/>Jeff: Chris, how many objectives do you think are out  there? <br/>Well, I'd say there's probably 13, but I think there will  be some lines drawn in the sand tonight. That's my perspective on it. <br/>Jeff: Michelle, you were nodding your head. <br/>I definitely see a line  drawn tonight. That means that trust will be broKen for some people, and  strengthened with others. <br/>Jeff: So Taylor, still not worried about tonight's vote? <br/>No, no, I don't think worry does anything. Some people are worried all the time. There's nothing you can do at this point to change the fate of  that. <br/>Jeff: Why are you smiling, Adam? He looks right at me when he said it. Does that say something? <br/>Jeff: How nervous are you right now? <br/>Very. <br/>Jeff: Because you heard your name? <br/>Yeah, and it's terrifying. Nobody wants to be first person voted out at the merge. This is a big milestone. To make it here is an incredible accomplishment. But this is where the fun begins. <br/>Jeff: All right. Time to vote. David, you're up. David, you're up. <br/>This one's for fig. <br/>This one's for fig. <br/>I have never been able to  trust you. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Adam. Michelle. Adam. Michelle. We're tied, two votes Michelle, two votes Adam. Adam. That's three votes Adam. Michelle. We're tied again. Three votes Michelle. Three votes Adam. Adam. That's four votes Adam. Michelle. Tied again. Four votes Michelle, four votes Adam. Michelle. That's five votes Michelle, four votes Adam. Michelle. That's six votes Michelle. Eighth person voted out and first member of our jury, Michelle. Seven. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Michelle, the tribe has spoKen. Time for you to go. Well, any time there are lines drawn in the sand, the question  is: Will they be there in the morning or will the tide wash them away? Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor," the battle lines  have been drawn. <br/>You and will and Taylor are all on the bottom. They're gunning my way. <br/>But Taylor can't keep a secret. <br/>I’m not going the leak  that to anyone. <br/>He can steal someone's reward. <br/>I'll put a massive target on misback. <br/>Dude, that will ruin his game. <br/>Oh, man, I think they didn't trust me or Jay or a group of  us, and I thought that the majority of people were with us. I thought I could lay back and trust what people had said, so I maybe  went overboard with my laying back.
