<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," Devens and David  weren't seeing eye to eye. <br/>Remember, we do have that idol. <br/>Just give me the half back. <br/>If you don't mind,'d like the hang on to it. <br/>Jeff: Facing tribal council. Wardog tried to get Kama to turn on each other. <br/>The final ain't going to be seven. <br/>Wardog may have a point. <br/>Jeff: And it worked. Ron and jelly were left in the dark when Eric was voted out at  he chose to go to the Edge of Extinction. <br/>Wardog controlled the vote. Now I know the Kama people are fractured. Ryan and Julie did not have any idea it was coming. Their reaction was gold. So now myself, Lauren and Kelley may get a chance the crack this  game open. <br/>That tribal council was disaster. Julie and I were left out of the loop. So I'm kind of gutted. Are you okay with your decision? <br/>I mean, I guess we'll find out. <br/>I've spent a lot of time making Kama stRong. We had the numbers. I'm sure people are going to look at this and say, how stupid  were they? All they had to do was vote out all the Lesu members. Eric, I don't see him ever playing you, Gavin, ever. All the power and control I thought I had I realize now I have  absolutely none. I'm on the bottom and I'm probably going to be voted out next. <br/>I don't know what to say. I just didn't want the get played out. <br/>I pull off a huge move. Eric was my closest ally in this game. But he was keeping me behind the curtain. <br/>Well, that worked out well. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm not wanting to go to the final three with blank  resume. I stepped up and decided to be first one to throw the punch. <br/>I just want you all to know three million percent I'm with  you guys. I trust you all, and if we want to make it a six, then we get Julia  and Victoria, because those are the two I have the most trust in. I made it apparent that I have this new alliance, and I told  them, guys, I'm with you now. This proves that I'm ready to take this six, you know, a new  alliance, to the end. <br/>Ride or die. Ride or die. <br/>Tribal council went exactly how I wanted it to go, except  for the fact that Rick and I voted differently, because he wasn't willing to  see my side of it. The right side of it. <br/>We're on separate pages. But we're still together. <br/>We are, we are, we are. Even if I wanted to split with Rick, I couldn't. We have to figure white house gets custody of our kid, this  nugget of a hidden immunity idol that is so very powerful, but not as long as  it remains intact. <br/>How do we move forward. <br/>We reestablish trust with Ron and Julie. <br/>Which should be easy for me, since I voted with them. <br/>Yeah. So the relationship needs to work because that idol is a tool  we're going to need to avoid one of us going home, and then we can make shake  things up and actually take control of this game. <br/>I had a horrible tribal last night. It was a horrible blindside. Now here I am. On the Edge of Extinction. I finally get to see it. All I know about this place is that it is hard, and there's not  much to do. Plus I came to Edge of Extinction immediately after the people  that I sent here. And now today's going to suck. <br/>When you read that sign, no disrespect to everyone else  here, but it doesn't hit as hard when you're the second, third, fourth, fifth  person some when I showed up here, it was just in the corner crying. <br/>The Edge of Extinction is its own unique challenge. There are no rewards here. There's no chance at pizza. In the game, there are a million distractions every day. Then you get here, and it's the great slowdown. It goes from a million to zero. And so it becomes easy to talk yourself off the edge of  distinction. You raise a flag, and all the difficulties are gone. <br/>You guys ever seriously contemplated leaving this place? <br/>No, I'll stick it out. <br/>For a split second, I was like, to the right is the  burgers and food. But that's not who I am. Eric is fighting himself and having some inner conflict, and it  does eyeball you, you know, that flag is waving out there. It's so easy just to say, you know what, I don't think I'm going  to win. It's only going to get harder, and it might be wearing on Eric a  little more. <br/>Oh, my God! You got a stingray, Reem! <br/>All right. <br/>But Chris ain't going anywhere. Aubry I know for sure, she ain't going anywhere. <br/>Wow, Chris. <br/>Reem is too invested to go anywhere. <br/>Chris, look at you go, man! I ain't going nowhere. Everyone is here the play. No one is going to be quitting any time soon. <br/>Nice job, buddy. <br/>Look at that guy. Chris comes back with a really big stingray, and I'm thinking,  there's a story here for me to tell my kids about not giving up, because  there's going to be a lot of days in their life, hard days, where I'm going  to be the one telling them, don't quit. <br/>Joe's up next. <br/>I don't know how many times I'm going to have to talk  myself out of raising that flag. <br/>That's amazing, but as a firefighter, I think I have more  grit than the average person. Now I'll get to see how much grit I actually have. It may be a lot. <br/>How you feeling this morning? <br/>I don't know. <br/>I voted with you guys. <br/>You did? <br/>So it was me and Ron were the only two out of it for Kama. <br/>Everything is up in the air after Eric gets voted out. I was right that there were huge cracks in Kama, I just didn't expect  them last night. I'm going to concentrate on Ron and Julie, because I showed them  I was loyal, I voted with them. <br/>So I'm open to whatever you and obviously -- see how  things develop and I want to make this my own game at this point, because I'm  like...  Let's be the pilot. <br/>I was really upset that I wasn't included on the vote for Eric  last night. It made me really start to question what to do and what the  future of my game is doing to look like. <br/>So we could be a voting bloc of four. All we need is two more. <br/>I don't... I'm not saying what I'm doing. I'm not saying anything. <br/>You think Aurora would work with us? <br/>Potentially. I think it's more one of your guys than ours at this point. <br/>What about Wardog? <br/>Obviously I have my issues with Wardog, but he could sort  of possibly work with us for a vote. <br/>I know you think we're Kama stRong, but I'm way past that. I feel like Julie has been running the show for a long time. I feel like she could run away with this whole game. She's so strategic. To me the two of us are on the bottom, and they're thinking of  them as the final four. So I'm ready to jump ship now. But it's just scary to jump ship. There is no one watching out for me here, and, oh, my God, it's  like it's been 23 days, and I'm just counting the days until I see my family  again. Because I have no support. And last night's blindside on err thank I wasn't a part of just  added to it. Sometimes the game is played in three-day chunks or it's like  three-hour chunks or it's like three-minute chunks. That's how I feel. <br/>You are stRong. You're going to do this. <br/>Thank you. I try and remember, why did I sign up for, this and it was to  push myself and it was the move myself, but I feel like what aim even doing  out here and where do I go from here? <br/>I've already got my mind on what I think needs to happen  next. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. Play it out for me. <br/>We need the stay with the alliance we made last night. If you feel comfortable, we pull in whoever else we want and  just get David out. <br/>David is very sneaky and strategic, but there is this trio  of Lesu members in Wardog, Kelley, and Lauren, and moving together with them,  that is something that worries me. <br/>So what do y'all think today? The only reason I think we should do David overall is because  he's been top four in the immunity challenges. <br/>The next few votes I'm really going to have to evaluate  the social relationships in the game and whether I have the numbers, because  they have a trio that are just as stRong together and don't seem to be going  anywhere. And it's all very concerning for me. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. <br/>Oh, this thing. Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: David having flashbacks. <br/>Yes, I am. <br/>Jeff: We ran this challenge in your season. <br/>Yep, I remember it well. <br/>Jeff: How did that go? <br/>Not well for me. <br/>Jeff: All right. Let's get to today's immunity challenge. First things first. Aurora, take back the hard-earned necklace. Thank you. Once again immunity is back up for grabs. For today's chang, you're going to stand on a narrow beam while  balancing a ball on a wooden bow. At regular intervals you'll move further down the beam, making  it more difficult. If at any point you fall off the beam or your ball drops, you're  out. Last person left standing wins immunity, safe from the vote. Losers, tribal council where somebody will be the ninth person  voted out of this game. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. Everybody plant your feet. Try the find a steady spot. Place your ball on your bow. And this challenge is on. Everybody concentrating on one thing, balancing a ball on a  wooden bow while on narrow beam. A little bit of early movement. Nice correction. Devin's -- Devens' ball moving now. He has to get it back the a resting spot. And he's now back quiet again. Dead still hot day in Fiji. Any other day this is a beautiful day in Fiji. Right now, oh, for some shade. Wet, dripping. Wardog with some movement. Wardog right on the edge. Wardog the first to drop. We are down to ten. After the shocked faces at the last tribal, pretty certain  everybody here feels they high need immunity tonight. -- they might need immunity tonight. Julie with a little bit of movement. Julie's the second person out of this challenge. An we are down to nine. Ten seconds left in this round. Aurora with a little bit of movement. Now. Gavin with more movement. Three, two, one... Everybody safe. Grab your balls. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Now we're going the move farther down the beam. You first have to balance on the most narrow part of the beam. Then you have to get the ball on the bow. Three, two, one... And this challenge is back on. Very little room on that beam for your feet. They're going to cramp quickly. Ron is struggling trying to hold that balance. <br/>Oh, my feet are on fire. Ron is the first to drop. Ron is out. Devens with a lot of movement. , but he's keeping it alive. And right behind Ron Devens right next to help. Devens drops. Devens is out. We're down to seven. Two men left in this challenge, five women. Both immunitys havezã³dlã± been wo women so far this season. Will that streak continue? Aurora with a little bit of movement now. Aurora is out of the challenge. Victoria can't do it. She's out. We're down to five. Wow. That was fast. Lauren had no chance to recover. Lauren is out. And we're down to four. It is Gavin, Julia, David, and Wentworth. David did this once. Could that be the difference today? That experience. Wentworth very solid. Gavin with some movement now in that lower half of the body causing  the ball up top to move. But another nice recovery. <br/>Come on, kel. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth's ball is on the move, but she recovers. <br/>Come on, kel. Come on, ke le. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth can't recover this time. Wentworth is out. We are down to three. Gavin and David on the ends and Julia in the middle. Julia still very solid. Nobody is going to give up. People are going to just give out. Out of nowhere Julia drops. Julia had been rock solid the entire challenge. Now hobbling back to the bench. An we're down to two. It's a showdown, Gavin versus David. For immunity, fight right now. This is one of those moments where you can start to drift. You don't want the drift. Wake up. Gavin's ball takes a big move. Almost caught him off guard, but a nice recovery. David looking very solid. David's first big movement. Has to recover. Can he? Gavin's ball still moving. David now in trouble. David can't recover. Gavin wins individual immunity, safe tonight at tribal council. <br/>Good job, man. <br/>Good job. <br/>Jeff: What a showdown. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Gavin, come on over. <br/>I've been waiting for this for a long time. <br/>Jeff: Really? How long? <br/>Sentence I was about eight. <br/>Jeff: Eight years old, watching "Survivor,"  dreaming of a moment like this. Here you are. You just outlasted everybody else. What is it? <br/>I was thinking about watching this with my family, you  know? I can already see my mom and my dad and my wife and my brother  just saying, come on, a little bit further. <br/>Jeff: Well, it worked. Gavin immunity, safe tonight at tribal council. As for the rest of you, somebody will be the ninth person voted  out of this game. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>I felt so accomplished beating David in this challenge,  because my plan was to get David sent home tonight, and if David would have  won, it was the worst possible scenario for me. Now I can say I'm the reason that David got sent home. <br/>Good job. <br/>Good job. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Everyone is going to go crazy. <br/>Can I talk to you? <br/>Yeah. <br/>We cleared that out fast. <br/>Sure did. <br/>For the first time since we've merged we get back from an  immunity challenge and there's no pretense. Everyone in camp scatters. David andry left in camp with jewela. I wanted to talk to her in that there is a big target in Kelley,  warren, and Wardog. Those three have been together since the very beginning. <br/>They're the three that never voted different from each  other. <br/>And then Gavin comes in. I'm able to give him the same pitch. <br/>Those three, they have been together the entire game. They have never voted apart from each other. <br/>Then Victoria --  All the Lesu members are still here. It's like, how did that happen? <br/>So I'm strike patient. I'm trying to let them see that what's best for all of us is to  break up a power trio in the game. Meanwhile, David and I will probably flip a coin to see who gets  to use the immunity idol tonight if we feel things aren't going our way. <br/>Here is my fear, that we vote out David, they go back to Kama  for the next vote and vote one of us out. <br/>I think if there is a way to convince us to do Ron over David,  that's our best play, because that really alienates Julie. <br/>I actually wish that David would have won, because Ron  would be next on the chopping block. Ron is a strategic cal threat. He has been kind of a leader on the Kama cult for a while. And I don't trust him. <br/>Here's my thing. <br/>Okay. <br/>Ji just my thought. <br/>Yeah. <br/>David has an challenge. If you do these challenges with Ron, I feel like Aurora. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We have options. That's good. So Lesu is saying that they're fine with the David vote. However, they keep pushing other option, such as Ron. It makes me believe that they might be all working together on  the low and they're trying to bamboozle us. <br/>I'm not rallying for either one. I don't really care. <br/>So I much prefer to change it up and try to reunite Kama  stRong and target the powerhouse in this game, which is Kelley. <br/>What are your thoughts on who you think the best person to  go home would be? <br/>I'm more for getting rid of either Kelley or David. <br/>So are we going for Kelley or David? <br/>I would say if we're going to it, break up the trio. I'd say get Kelley out of here. <br/>There is a Lesu three package deal and then there's dave  and devon. We want to get rid of which package we consider most dangerous  first. Three is bigger than the work and it seems that we're all  leaning toward Kelley some if we get rid of the queen bee, maybe the live  will fall apart. <br/>I tried to be strategic. That obviously didn't work. So I just want to be a passenger, and I will vote whoever you  say, and I don't want to go home. So I will work with y'all an I'll earn your trust back, and I  will do whatever needs to happen. <br/>The Kama group obviously is wanting to make Ron and I feel  really comfortable. <br/>I don't feel like y'all trust me. <br/>But I don't know if what they're pitching me is really  true. I don't know who I can trust. That's what I can't stand about this game. It's how does the paranoia ever go away? I don't have anything to lose right now, because I'm already at  such a low, and I got to somehow pull myself together fast. That's happening, soon. I need the make a move. <br/>We want to vote for Kelley. <br/>David is a challenge beast. He's been in the top four every single time. <br/>I swear to you, you are safe tonight. <br/>I'm telling you, David tonight and this game is ours. This is theturning point, plain and similar. Everyone wanted to blindside Kelley. That's not what I've wanted. I've grown closer to Kelley. But they shut it down, and I was pissed. I thought I had a vote on what we said. But it turned into a dictatorship. <br/>It's pretty crispy today. <br/>Moving forward, I'm just trying to establish trust with  the remaining Kama people. But I have developed over my time a Survivor spidey sense. And now we find ourselves sitting at a dinner table and no one  is saying a word. And if no one is saying a word, it's because there's probably  talking about you and thinking about you and voting you home tonight. There's no question that we are playing the idol tonight. The only question is on who? <br/>Okay. Let's talk about how we want the use that idol. <br/>My spidey sense says it's me. <br/>I think it's you, too. <br/>What? <br/>Did you see Julia? <br/>I haven't talked to her all day. <br/>I don't know. <br/>The Kama people all day they've been fine with me. And then Julia is just going... We got the plan. Like, okay. And then Aurora is just like sleeping. She won't talk to me. And Victoria is scraping the pot like, doesn't want to say a  word. Gavin comes in camp and he has his head down. Won't look at me. Like I'm having flashbacks of cambodia. Like y'all have got some plan in motion. You're trying to make me feel okay. There's a good chance I'm getting some votes. My gut is telling me that I may want to play my idol. And trusting your gut in this game is huge. Because even the people that you think you can trust you can't  always trust. And right now I'm trusting people acting very strange. <br/>Jeff: Now bring in the members of our jury. So there is an implicit agReement on "Survivor" which  is nobody is to be trusted, and yet everybody will choose to trust one or  more people. It's this implied agReement that makes the blindside possible. So, Julie, what's the feeling of being on the right side of a  blindside and the wRong side of a blindside? <br/>I was definitely on the wRong side of the blindside last  tribal council, and it is not a good feeling. So I felt like my whole game got turned upside down because I  don't trust anyone at this point. <br/>Jeff: Aurora, what was the fallout from the last time,  what appeared to be a blindside? <br/>A blindside comes with danger. You have to not bring everyone in, because if you do, likely the  blindside won't happen. And a lot of these people were people that left out people the  time before. So it's not about each move that you're left out, it's the final  goal that you want together. <br/>Jeff: Why the reaction to that, Wardog? <br/>It sounded like, last week we needed to use a few people  to take Eric out, and this week we don't need those people some was a  passenger on their plan or a passenger on our plan. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth, you were nodding in agReement. <br/>I think that was the vibe back at camp. I was trying to establish trust with a group of people, however,  this Kama group may have gotten back together. So I'm not completely certain what is going to happen tonight. <br/>Jeff: David, any time you hear a statement followed by,  "However" or "But," it means I'm not sure I meant  anything I just said. <br/>It's way to give you an answer without blowing up your own  game, but... This morning in the water I spotted this huge pool of minnows. Eventually a shark came through and ate a bunch of them. And tonight with the reconstituted Kama, it's likely that one of  the Lesu is a minnow. <br/>Jeff: Did that really happen? <br/>Yeah. It was while I was taking a poop, but yeah. <br/>Jeff: Devens, we have a new analogy thanks to David. Where are you? Are you a minnow or a shark? <br/>I might be the poop at this point. I have no idea what's going on. There are a few people at camp that were the hot date today,  which was Gavin and Aurora and Julia and Victoria. And they were going to get back to us with an answer, and they  intentionally let the clock run out. <br/>Wow, Gavin, that is a very bold, honest statement. <br/>Yeah, I mean, that's not as much as I'm avoiding you and  everybody breaking off in groups. You think you have a set plan, you meet back up with your group,  and things have changed. <br/>Jeff: Julie, I have seen enough tribals to know that trust  isn't what it appears to be. It changes. <br/>It definitely can change quickly. I was feeling good yesterday, and I feel like I've hit an  all-time low today. I am physically and mentally drained, and I can't do it  again  Jeff: What's going on? <br/>I don't know. I]m/&lt; feel like a lunatic for getting this emotional because  it's a game. There are so many other worse things going on in the world, but  it's so much harder than I thought, because I don't have a clear mind. And then when you feel like you've been left out in the dark of  people that you trusted, no matter how much they say you can trust them, I  don't think the plan I've been told is happening tonight. I'm sure it's another blindside on the two of us 100%. So I just feel like, if I'm here tomorrow, I'm a free agent at  this point. Like I can't trust the people that I tried to trust all along in  this game. <br/>Well, this vote will let Julia and me know if we can trust  the people we want to work work and if all goes as planned, then Julie and I  will be in great shape and we will feel so much better. <br/>Jeff: Two things to address. First, one of the great things, Julie, about Survivor being in  this 38th season, is the people that are fans of this show, they understand  this game. There's nobody watching that thinks you're a lunatic because  you're exhausted after 23 days in this game. Everyone gets it. The other fascinating thing is that while you are crying and  pleading your case, other people are almost giggling at the audacity of what  you're saying. So Julia, I know you have empathy for how she's feeling. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: But from a game point of view, what did you find so  interesting about what she said. <br/>What I was more so giggling at was Wentworth looking over  at me asking if we're till good. I was like, yes, that was the giggle. All these plans going on, and the "Survivor" madness  that is occurring right now. <br/>I don't know exactly what's going on, but I feel like Julia  gave the game away when she said Wentworth asked if the plan was in motion. She said, yes, I guess they're going with the Lesu three. That seems pretty clear. <br/>Jeff: Aurora, you can't trust anything. You don't know what Wentworth and Julia are really doing, and  you're sitting on the edge thinking what? <br/>I love how Lesu, whether they're together or split,  they're playing the game just like we're playing the game. We can't act like last tribal it didn't click with them that  maybe they could work together if they got over their differences. One side is like, oh, we're with you and we're going to blind  side the other. The other is we're with you and we're going to blind side them. What they're trying to do is create mistrust. <br/>Yeah, Kama really gets along, ask Eric and Aubry and Joe  and the two people you left out of the last vote how well Kama gets along and  can trust each other. <br/>I didn't say you were the only dysfunctional. We admit it to. <br/>We're totally dysfunctional. <br/>We owned it. <br/>No one is denying that. <br/>It's very clear where Lesu stands. It's not about generalizing each word in each statement. Like David was talking about how you've got sharks and minnows. There are also other things in the sea that are creating  problems or making them get into a pack to be susceptible to sharks. <br/>Jeff: Wardog, I'm just confused. I mean, I'm trying to get Aurora's mindset. Nobody is blaming Kama. Nobody is blaming Lesu. We're all dysfunctional. She got left out of the second vote. She was left out of first vote. We were all left out of a vote. <br/>Just throwing this out there, it seems like there is a  really stRong Kama group that doesn't want us messing with them. Then we have five Lesu and two Kamas have been left out. That's seven people. We can do whatever we wanted if Aurora really wants us to work together. <br/>I thought you guys were so dysfunctional that you would  never work together again. So how is Rick throwing out this plan where all of a sudden  --  I think Aurora threw it out. I'm just on board. <br/>That'ses assanine member. You're such a passenger, Rick. <br/>I feel like I just handed out the imment p.S. <br/>I can see why Julia would not want that. For the seven of us, we could get through this vote and take the  power from Kama, who is clearly messing with all of us. <br/>Rick, you're paranoid because you're not part of any of  the many plans that are formed here tonight. If I'm not part of any of the plans, shouldn't I form my own  plan, Julia? <br/>Sure, go for it. <br/>Thank you. <br/>But there are many plans already set. <br/>So you're making a commitment for the other Lesu that you  haven't even talked to and that that you just...  No, I'm broaching it with them. But I think it's a great idea to be honest. <br/>Rick's proposal is sounding better and better to me right  now. <br/>Jeff: Wow. <br/>David, the smile on your face speaks to what I'm guessing  is there are several layers of story happening. Some people trying to misdirect some hoping this plan goes  through. <br/>I'm actually seeing a lot of desperation. Look at all these conversations that are happening. Everybody is trying the figure out what the hell is going on. <br/>Jeff: I don't even want to ask a question. It's way better to watch. <br/>That's right. <br/>Here we go. <br/>It's on. <br/>I'll go Aurora right now. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Remember me? <br/>Yes, I remember you. <br/>David? Devens? <br/>Okay. Hang on. <br/>Can I ask you guys, if I talk plan to all of you guys, was  that for sure? There was no --  Okay. That's what I thought. <br/>Because I'm not going to turn on your guys. <br/>I'll be honest. You guys will have the numbers. <br/>Victoria? <br/>What? <br/>No. <br/>I'm ready for the two of us to jump ship. The five Lesu are on a journey and the two of us will join you,  because this is so beyond --  David, it's for your game. <br/>You're not working with Victoria. <br/>Are you not? <br/>I'm supposed to be. I hope I am. <br/>Nothing has changed. I swear to you. <br/>It look like we're not going to have it. <br/>Julia or Lauren? <br/>You tell me the name and I'll do it right now. There are seven of us right here. <br/>I love how there are seven of us. <br/>They're saying your name, Julia. <br/>Let's talk about it. You want to talk about my name? <br/>Too many looks all day today that I call that you didn't  think I caught. I'm out. I'm out. No, you know what, I've seen the looks. I have seen the looks, and Ron should know not to trust it. 100%...  We're the only people that voted. <br/>What was the plan tonight. Can you tell me? It was me? <br/>Yes. <br/>Okay. Thank you for your honesty. <br/>No, no, last second I'm talking to people and they won't  even tell me which one was the choice. I wasn't even told until the very end by Gavin which one was the  choice tonight. <br/>Julie, Julie, Julie. <br/>If you want to do a plan, let's do plan. <br/>I want to know I can trust you. <br/>Okay. We can do something right now. <br/>Julie, really? You're about to throw away Kama control to Lesu. <br/>I don't have Kama control. I'm on the bottom. <br/>We all have the control. <br/>I'm ready to jump ship. I'm ready to jump ship. I'm ready to jump ship. <br/>Are you okay? <br/>Oh, my God, she lost her damn mind. <br/>I was left out of that vote and I've been left out all  day. Nobody approached me with any strategy. <br/>We had just gotten back. <br/>I can pull Julie back over here, but don't mention that. <br/>Julie, Julie, can I talk to you, please? <br/>Wow. <br/>I heard that. <br/>Whatever, man. This is like a mess now. <br/>It's actually very clean now. <br/>I have been on Kama with you guys since day one, and if  you think you can trust Lesu members moving forward...  Who voted with you last tribal? <br/>You weren't even the target. <br/>Julia, I know I'm not the target, but guess what, I'm in  the pilot's seat. I'm trying the drive. <br/>Go ahead, drive, buddy. Drive, buddy. <br/>Jeff: Wow. I have never seen anything like it. <br/>Let's vote. <br/>Shut up, Wardog. <br/>Jeff: Devens, it is still clearly up in the air. <br/>Yeah, it's a live tribal, Jeff. It seems to be pretty live. <br/>It's the livest. This is as live as it gets. <br/>I was criticized for bringing up the idea, but I think I'm  glad that I did. <br/>Jeff: Everybody sat back down. Does that mean...  Yes, we're ready. <br/>We are ready to vote. Let's lock it. <br/>Jeff: All right. One of the single craziest tribals I have ever been witness to. I cannot wait to see what comes of it. It is time to vote. Aurora, you're up. <br/>Well, that was one for the ages. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. <br/>Jeff. Just to add some excitement, and so that there's no secrets  going back to camp, I think David and I would like the play a little  something. <br/>A little insurance policy, just in case, on a chaotic  night, just to make sure everything pays off, guys. I'd like to play this for my buddy David. <br/>Jeff: Okay. When paired together, these two pieces do form one hidden  immunity idol. Any votes cast for David will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote, David. Does not count. <br/>What? Kelley. That's one vote Wentworth. Julia. One vote Julia. Jewela. That's two votes Julia. Jewela. Three votes Julia. One vote Wentworth. Jewela. That's four votes Julia. Julia. That's five votes Julia. One vote Wentworth. Ninth person voted out and the sixth member of our jury, Julia. That's six. That's enough, you need to bring me your torch. <br/>Good job, guys. Really. <br/>Jeff: Julia, the tribe has spoken. <br/>It's been such a pleasure, guys. I know it's a game, but really, take care of yourself and take  care of each other. Good luck. <br/>Thank you. <br/>If you want chance to get back in the game, take the torch  and get in the boat. Well let's do it  Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff:next time on "Survivor," empire rises. <br/>I want to build a six. <br/>Person alliance. <br/>Which person do you take out now? <br/>But with the kingdom together, we run the game. <br/>Jeff: A monarch could fall. <br/>I think we gop  I'm ready to expect fireworks tonight. <br/>Tribal council was a mess. I have no idea what happened with the vote. And now I'm this close to really being out of the game. So I'm definitely going to have to fall back on my will and my  motivation and that will be a true test to whether or not I'm willing to push  myself to stay in it.
