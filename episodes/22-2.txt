<br/>Episode 2 -  <br/>Jeff: previously on "Survivor": 16 castaways  were airlifted to a remote beach in nicaragua. Welcome to survivor! Where they were surprised by two of survivor's most villainous  rivals. <br/>Boston Rob! <br/>Jeff: Boston Rob and Russell hantz. These two offer 156 days of "Survivor" experience. Rob, you join ometepe. Russell hantz, you join zapatera. Come on, Russell, let's go. <br/>Jeff: There is one more twist. When you are voted out, you will not go home. <br/>What! <br/>Jeff: Instead you will be sent to redemption island, where  you will live alone. When the next person joins you on redemption island, the two of  you will square off in a duel. <br/>What? <br/>Jeff: The winner stays. The loser is out of the game for good. At the zapatera tribe, Russell lost no time aligning with the  pretty young tribemate. <br/>When we get to the merge, it will be over. <br/>Done. <br/>Jeff: But everyone else immediately figured out what Russell  was up to. <br/>At this point, get Russell gone as soon as possible. <br/>Jeff: At the ometepe tribe, almost everyone fell under Boston  Rob's charismatic spell. <br/>It's such a blessing to have Rob here. We might as well call it camp harmony right now. <br/>Jeff: But Kristina decided Rob was too dangerous to keep  around so she joined forces with Phillip and Francesca to get him out. <br/>I'm totally on board. <br/>Okay, cool. <br/>Jeff: And when Kristina found the hidden immunity idol,  her plan seemed foolproof. At tribal council Phillip turned on his allies and spilled the  beans to his entire tribe. <br/>You and Francesca approached me to go along with them  because she has an immunity idol. Jeff, I'm a former special agent. <br/>Are you a crazy person. <br/>Jeff: Francesca was voted out. The tribe has spoken. But you will have a chance to re-enter this game. Take your torch. Head to redemption island. <br/>Ah, good times. After what happened at tribal council tonight, it's been kind of  downhill. Now redemption island, my mind is just racing. I don't think I'm going to sleep tonight. I don't really see how I can sleep tonight. I don't know what I'm going to do. Life on redemption island: You will have basic supplies to help  you maintain your world here. You will receive a ration of rice each day and plenty of  drinking water. At a certain point, the remaining person on redemption island  will re-enter the game and resume their quest for the title of sole survivor  and the million-dollar prize. Good luck. Tribal council was crazy. I thought that it would be, but not like that. Phillip totally just flipped out and said a lot of things. And I certainly wasn't expecting to be voted out, but it's all  right. I have a second chance. Here I am on my island. Please, god, tell me I have flint. Oh, wonderful. Wonderful, wonderful. Okay. I think that coming to redemption island could be the best thing  for my game because, you know, I was on good terms with everyone in my tribe,  but I was not part of, like, the core alliance. So if I can make it out here and come back at some point in the  game when things are changing because things are changing every day, I could  still win "Survivor." let's see if I can start a fire all by  myself. I'm actually not sad at all that I'm not going back to my camp  because I'd much rather be here than still be back in the game with Phillip  and all those people. Oh, god. <br/>That was-- that turned-- that whole thing--  That was one of the wildest tribal councils I've ever been  a part of. <br/>Really. <br/>They were yelling at each other. <br/>It was pretty wild. <br/>The tribal council didn't go exactly as I had hoped. It would have been perfect if I hadn't mentioned anything to Phillip  at all about having the hidden immunity idol. I lost the battle, but it's not the end of the game. I still have the idol in my possession, and I am so grateful I  did not play that thing. I'm so happy. <br/>Can I talk to you for a second? <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>Step over here, please. <br/>I know for a fact that Kristina and Phillip were lying but  it doesn't take a genius f.B.I. Man to figure that out. All you had to do was look at their faces and watch their lips  moving. <br/>I almost got duped tonight, today. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I want to say some things from my heart to you. Until I go to redemption you own my vote. <br/>Thanks. <br/>When I come back, I'm a competitor like I said. <br/>This guy Phillip, f.B.I., whatever special agent, he is a  piece of work. He told me that I own his vote for the rest of the time he's  here until he goes to redemption island. <br/>I want to play to the level of integrity that when I say  something, it means something. That's really--  I don't know if he's delusional. I think he's a good-hearted guy. I do. Just might not all be there. Let it be a lesson to you-- government jobs, stressful. <br/>Let's get to six and then we can play all the strategy we  want. But, like, let's just get to six first. I'm not making any bones about it. This is my alliance. That's it. <br/>And now once we know who we're voting for, now we know we  don't tell anybody else. <br/>Vote Phillip. Phillip's gone. With the exception of Phillip's little twist where he decided to  out Francesca, things went pretty much according to plan. It seems as if this group of players knows how to follow  directions. Phillip did it to himself. He's an idiot. Just try to win a couple of challenges before we have to let him  go. <br/>I'm down with that. <br/>Right there. Look at that. Just missed him. When I went hunting for the crabs, you know, you find yourself  going back to that primal state. There's a part of that comes to a place where you realize here  in survivor, you are going to be tested in so many ways. <br/>The fine specimen is creeping up on his prize. <br/>He has his pink shorts on. <br/>There traps the crabs. <br/>When I revealed to the girls that I was a former federal  agent, it was designed to let the girls know that I am a trustworthy person  and at tribal council last night, Francesca maligned my character and I was  definitely impacted emotionally because one of the things about me is that I  love my country. Having worn the uniform that I swore that I was prepared to-- to  protect and defend, to have her try to take some of that pride I have, and  having served as a special agent and earned the right to be called  "Trustworthy," it hurt me. It made me angry. I had lots of emotional feelings going on. Got one! Got one! And I think the best lesson I got last night for me personally  besides the game aspect was I still love Phillip sheppard. He's a good guy. And that's okay. Killed one with a stone, baby. <br/>You are a legend, sir. <br/>These fools that I'm dealing with, they ain't too bright. And poor old Ralph. That dude might be the dumbest player to ever play. He might be the dumbest player person the face of the earth. It's pitiful. But I've got a good player with me. Stephanie's a good player. Now all I need is kristin. Three worked for me before. I believe it just might work for me again. Okay, you know what we need to do? Next challenge, for reward, there might be a clue for the hidden  idol. What we're going to have to do is you're going to have to look  everywhere. I'm going to tell Stephanie the same thing. <br/>Okay. <br/>I'm going to start looking for the idol without the clue  today. So-- I come to realize that I can trust nobody but my people. Krista and Stephanie, my alliance, my two girls. That's it. I believe that's all I have right now. They have one somewhere for sure. Look in trees. Right now, I have to go all out. So my plan is find the idol. Yeah, you've seen me play before. You know what you seen? You seen me finding idols. That's what you seen. It's how I play this game. <br/>Russell is running around looking for the idol. <br/>Yeah. I was picking up a few rocks, and I just happened to look in  that stump, and I thought what's that rock doing in there and I pulled it out  and there lay the idol. I just can't believe I found it that easy. Russell thought he was king at finding them idols. He knows where they're at. So, Russell, eat your heart out, man. Oh, baby, you're mine. <br/>It gives me a certain peace knowing I'm not out here by  myself, you know. I was praying god would put me in an alliance like the kind he  wanted me to be in. I'm pretty thrilled. <br/>Me too, me, too. <br/>He's so hard core. You need to come hang out in wisconsin. <br/>Will you? Matt is really cute. Good to look at, but, you know we're just-- we're close, and I  think we have a little bit of loyalty going on. Actually, yeah. <br/>Matt's trying to play the good guy, but Andrea knows what  she wants, and if she can have her little puppy dog along for the ride, she's  going to walk him. She's going to walk him all over this island, and for me, that's  not good because I know how strong a pair can be in this game. Like amber and I. But now I'm thinking about who I'm going to sit next to at the  end. How's the vibe with him? Everybody good. <br/>Yeah, for sure. <br/>What about Matty and Andrea? <br/>I think they're dangerous. <br/>Matt's looking for a way to get far with Andrea. <br/>Yeah. <br/>For sure. I mean, for sure, 100%, I know that game. I played that game with amber. You know. I think Natalie's a perfect partner at this point, but it's  going to be hard, though. It's like, literally, picking the girl up, putting her on my  back, and I'm going to drag your ass to the end, and hopefully they're going  to give it to me at the end. The options, as I see it, if we lose the next one, we have to  get rid of Phillip or we have to get rid of Andrea in order to keep the tribe  strong. Matt will get hurt by it, but we don't have to tell Matt, you  know. <br/>Yeah. <br/>All right? <br/>Sounds good. <br/>I'm going to make big moves, but I really trust Rob, and I  think making big moves along with him will be smart. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! Zapatera getting your first look at the new ometepe tribe. Francesca voted out at the last tribal council. <br/>What? <br/>She was strong. <br/>They're dumb. <br/>Jeff: All right you guys ready to get to today's immunity  challenge. <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: First things first, Ralph, I'll take it back. <br/>I'll get it back. <br/>Jeff: Oh, yeah. <br/>See you tonight. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, does that inspire you when somebody throws  that in your face and says, "This baby is coming back with  us."  It brings out the animal in me. I will outlast any man over there. <br/>Jeff: what about the women? <br/>That's another day. We'll see. <br/>Jeff: All right, for today's challenge, you're going to  swim out to a platform, climb to the top, smash a tile, and retrieve a key,  then the next person goes. Once you've retrieved all five keys, one person will use those  keys to open a box and retrieve a ball. The remaining two tribe members will use that ball to break five  tiles. First tribe to break all five tiles wins immunity, is safe from  the vote, and avoids redemption island. In addition, you are playing for reward. Fishing gear. <br/>Oh, fishing stuff! [ applause ]  Jeff: You've got a mask, fins. You've got line, hook, sinker. You've got a fishing spear. <br/>Sweet! <br/>Jeff: Big reward. Losers, tribal council where somebody will be voted out, will be  sent to redemption island, and will have to face off against Francesca in a  duel. Zapatera, you have one extra tribemember. Sitting one person out. Who's it going to be? <br/>David. <br/>Jeff: David, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. Here we go. For reward and immunity, survivors ready? Go! Brandt and Steve in the water first. Brandt almost gets there just on his dive alone. Grant up quickly. Grant gets the key. <br/>He's good! [ applause ]  Bring it home! <br/>Jeff: Grant is back. Ashley's in the water. <br/>Come on, Ashley! <br/>Jeff: Sarita's in the water. Ashley now with a leave on ometepe. Sirita trying to pick up some ground. Ashley with a nice smash and grabs the key. <br/>Yeah, way to go! <br/>Jeff: Sarita smashes her tile. Ashley is back. Matt is in the water. Sarita trying to get back. Matt already to the platform. Sarita's back. Julie's in the water for zapatera. <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>Jeff: Matt has the third key for ometepe. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: Andrea with a belly flop in the water. Julie smashes a tile. Julie's got to get the key now. Andrea in the air. <br/>Right there! <br/>Jeff: Ometepe with a one-key lead. Russell in the water for zapatera. Boston Rob now going for that fifth key. For ometepe. <br/>You got it! <br/>Go, Russell! <br/>Jeff: Russell smashes the tile. And comes up with the key in hand. <br/>Come on, Rob! <br/>Jeff: Rob smashes the tile and comes up with the key in  hand. Mike in the water for zapatera. Rob back with the fifth key. Natalie now working on those locks. Mike has the fifth and final key for zapatera. Zapatera was behind but they have caught up. Stephanie now working on the locks. There are five keys. Only three locks. Stephanie has the first lock undone for zapatera. <br/>Spin it back the other way. There you go! <br/>Jeff: Natalie has her first lock undone. Stephanie has the second lock undone for zapatera. Natalie has the second lock open. <br/>Stephanie has all three locks open. She's got the box open. There's one ball. <br/>Take your time. <br/>Jeff: Natalie has the third lock open. <br/>Hand me the ball. Hand me the ball. <br/>Jeff: It is Ralph and Phillip tossing balls. Phillip breaks the first tile for ometepe. Ralph breaks the first tile for zapatera. <br/>Let's go, Phillip, you got this. <br/>Jeff: Ralph breaks the second tile for zapatera. Ralph breaks the third tile for zapatera. Let's see that animal, Phillip. <br/>Come on! Come on, baby, here we go! <br/>Jeff: Ralph breaks the fourth tile for zapatera. One more tile and they win immunity and reward. <br/>Daggone it! <br/>Jeff: Ometepe breaks their second tile. Ralph just misses. Ometepe breaks their third tile. <br/>You got this, Ralph, you got it. <br/>Dang! <br/>Jeff: Ralph all around that last tile but can't break it. Ometepe breaks their fourth tile. It is 4-4. One tile left. Ralph breaks the fifth tile! Zapatera wins reward and immunity. <br/>What is he doing? Matt's shaking the opposition's hand after we lost the  challenge. That's despicable. When just got our asses kicked, not once, but twice, back to  back. I'm not going ever to the other team and giving them hugs and  kisses. Zapatera you said you would win it again and you did. <br/>Thank you! Going home. <br/>Jeff: zapatera come collect your reward and head back to  camp. All right, ometepe, tribal council once again. Somebody will be voted out. That person will go directly to redemption island where you will  join Francesca, and you will compete in a duel. It will be your last chance to save yourself in this game. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I will see you tonight at tribal council. <br/>Holy crap. <br/>It's getting ready to pour. <br/>We just win the challenge, so I grab the basket because I  know if there's going to be a clue, it's going to be in that basket. And as I'm walking, I see a clue slipping out of the flippers. I don't say anything to anybody. I just grab the clue and put it in my hand. I know this game. This isn't my first rodeo. <br/>Ralph, you were awesome. <br/>Here's Ralph, he's like this. <br/>When we come back to camp, I seen Russell with a little  rolled up piece of paper, and I said to myself, he has got the daggone clue  out of that daggone basket, so, Russell he's going to pay the price because  this is not Russell's game. This is my game. <br/>He's got a clue. <br/>The clue's in the basket. It's all of ours. <br/>From now on, we take the reward. <br/>Exactly. <br/>We were dog paddling at one point. And everybody wants to throw the baton. <br/>She's like, "I'm great swimming short  distance."  No, you're not. You suck at life, okay. <br/>From the fishing basket right now, you saw him take it  out? <br/>Of course he did, of course he did. After our victory, Sarita came and told me in the fishing gear  we got was a clue, Russell stuffed it in his pocket. Ralph saw it. That's what comes from experience. He knew the clue was in there. <br/>Ladies, I'll give you the honor. <br/>The guy is the most untrustworthy character I've ever met  in my life. He preached over and over that this game was about trust and who  you could go deep with. If we're in this together show me some faith and share the clue. <br/>Clue to hidden immunity. If the looming vote has you in a scary spot, then I'd look where  something is alive next to something that's not. <br/>Okay. <br/>Something's dead. <br/>Something that's alive, something that is not. I knew they were going to be like this. But you know what, somebody doesn't have this clue, it's going  to be hard to solve the puzzle. <br/>Obviously. <br/>Okay. <br/>I have three people, three votes. That's all I need. I never had numbers. I always make it to the end. I don't need no stinkin numbers. All I need is trust, loyalty. That's how I play this game. <br/>This game's gonna get very interesting. <br/>For sure. <br/>Sarita looked terrible. <br/>What's that? <br/>Sarita--  Yeah. <br/>She was dog paddling. <br/>She's weak, she's weak. <br/>She was dog paddling at one point. <br/>I agree. <br/>It was a pitiful performance. <br/>Yeah, we didn't do that well. <br/>I mean, we're all players here. <br/>Four more to win. And I say we win them all. <br/>Russell, there wasn't no hidden immunity clue in that bag,  was there? <br/>Maybe there was. <br/>I saw you take something out. Was that it? <br/>We won it. You didn't win it. We all won it. <br/>There wasn't no clue in there. <br/>Russell. <br/>Russell. <br/>Calm down, guys. This is how the game's played. You either with me or against me. <br/>We just want to know if there was one in there. <br/>What if there was? <br/>No I ain't threatening you. Though it will be all of ours. <br/>That's not how this game is played, my friend. <br/>We could have easily lost, Russell and then where in the  hell would you have been. <br/>You don't got it? <br/>I don't have it. <br/>You say you ain't got it. <br/>I ain't got it. <br/>All right, big boy. <br/>But I don't like how you coming at me. <br/>I was just asking you. <br/>I'm just saying I don't like how you coming at me. <br/>Oh, you don't? <br/>No. <br/>I'm just asking you. <br/>I'm just letting you know that. <br/>Okay, whatever. <br/>I know how to play this game. Are you trying to tell me how to play the game? <br/>This ole boy here does, too. <br/>Sounds good to me. <br/>I just want to be honest with you. You can't be honest back. Thank you, Russell. He's got it. It's all right. I've already got one. I didn't need it. I'll play his game. I'll show him how smart I can be. Right on. <br/>What the hell was that? Ralph went off. He said he knows how to play this game. He's like, "I know how to play this game, too."  really? Really? You just done that to me, to Russell hantz, and you know how to  play this game? <br/>I got my luxury item today in tree mail. It's a journal. I have no idea what's going to happen. I don't know when the next person comes to redemption island. I have no idea what the duel is going to entail. <br/>And I hope we don't have to coexist here for a while. That would suck, especially if that person was Phillip. <br/>I'd like to speak for a second like we did after the last  challenge. I'll be very brief. Could you come over for a second, Matt? Thanks. <br/>So we get back from the challenge, and once again, we have  to endure the pretribal council before tribal council. <br/>I want to say to all my fellow contestants and tribe  members. I thought you guys performed gallantry. You were outstanding. You should be proud of your effort. I only wish I could have performed in my moment as well as all  of you did today. And having said that, I want you to know I won't be running  around saying, "Will you do this, will you do that?" the next thing  that went on a few days ago. It's not necessary. I'll leave it to the tribe to decide what's best for the tribe. Thank you. If y'all want to say anything, feel free. Okay. <br/>Phillip, Phillip. You did good. It's a team effort. We win as a team. We lose as a team. It sucks that we have to do what we have to do now, but that's  part of the game. <br/>That's right. <br/>It could have been any of us. <br/>Cool, let's get to work. Let's get this place ready. <br/>Let's get that fire going. <br/>Phillip blew the challenge, plain and simple. But look, we just got our asses whipped twice, and Matt goes to  congratulate the other team. Matt's trying to play the good christian game and the social  game and the end game on day friggin' five. Wake up, brother. <br/>Phil. Are you worried? <br/>That looks pretty on you. <br/>Oh, thanks. <br/>No. Because I'm a strong man. And if it's to be redemption, I kind of like that name. <br/>Tonight I'm playing the idol. I don't have a choice. They still have enough votes to vote off whoever they want. So they're no way they're not going to take the chance and let  me slip bay again so I'm playing it for sure, which is really sad. <br/>So what are we doing? <br/>I don't know, do you trust Matt and Andrea that they'll  stay with us? <br/>Andrea is decent in challenges. Like, she's a strength, I feel like. <br/>I'm telling you, man--  I understand we--  We're in a weird spot. It's like what do we do, get rid of Matt. It's crazy. It's crazy. But this is such a weird spot we're in right now. They'll never expect four of us to vote for Matt. I don't want to vote for Matt, but, honestly, him going over to  the other tribe, it makes me sick. <br/>I know, it's not cool. <br/>It makes me sick. <br/>It's not something you want to see when you're in the heat  of the moment of a challenge you lost your teammate going over and shaking  hands. I don't know. There's a time and place for those things, and that wasn't one  of those times. We just all four for Matt? <br/>Four of us vote for Matt and that's it. But we tell Matt and Andrea we're splitting votes. And then we'll find out if they were figuring to screw us. We'll see when the votes come through. <br/>Right. <br/>You know? I don't really want to vote Matt out. I like him, but, hey, it happens. <br/>The first game plan was to vote out Phillip or Andrea. Well, Matt's getting four votes. I didn't want to play "Survivor" like this. I really didn't. I wanted to keep my team strong. I mean, I get it. Matt's playing "Survivor." he's playing textbook. But he's playing with me. <br/>All of us are safe and there's no way any of us go home. So how do we want to do it? <br/>Let's just split it. <br/>Let's just split it. <br/>Keep it simple. Girls Kristina. Guys phil. <br/>The plan is we are going to split the votes. Girls vote for Kristina, guys vote for Phillip and we're  assuming Kristina will use the idol and Phillip will go home. <br/>Done? Done. <br/>As far as Matt and Andrea are concerned we're going to  split votes 3-3. The girls are all voting for christine. The guys are all voting for Phillip. But in all actuality, none of that is happening. Myself, Ashley, Natalie, and Grant, we're all voting for Matt. And christine with this idol, she better play that thing. If she plays the idol we can break up Andrea and Matt, it's a  home run. <br/>Could you tell me who do you want me to vote for? <br/>I don't know. We'll see. <br/>All right. You let me know. <br/>He doesn't have a single play. He has nowhere to go. <br/>He wants me to tell him what to do and spare him,  but--  But it wouldn't be sparing him. <br/>No. <br/>Hey, man, let's take a walk. <br/>Every day Rob impresses me. Like, it is unbelievable how well he can just talk to people and  play this game and see what they need and fulfill that need. It's absolutely amazing. <br/>So the wheels are in motion for everything to happen. And everything's gonna happen the way it should happen. I still don't know who it's going to be yet. We haven't decided, but no Matter who it is, I'm telling you,  you're going to be fine. <br/>Okay I'll take you on your word, man. <br/>Here's the thing. You have to-- like, first of all, don't go off on a tirade at  tribal like did you last time. <br/>I'm not going to do that. <br/>I'm not trying to pull one over on you. I have no reason to. Phillip's a tough cookie. I literally have to wait until one minute before we go to tribal  council. I may actually even have to tell him at tribal council who to  vote for because Phillip likes to talk a lot. He's liable to run around and tell everybody in the group  everything we're doing. The plan is bigger than just tonight. So here's the deal. When the time comes to vote, I'm gonna take my right hand and  put it on the shoulder of the person I want you to vote for. Okay? <br/>Okay. <br/>But you need to feel like you're going home. <br/>Okay. <br/>Obviously, the way things are going, you know, the way--  in order for everything to work out-- you're a smart guy. You can figure out where we're going with all of this. <br/>Right. <br/>Kind of like-- you're an actor, bro. I know it may be me tonight, and if it is--  Okay. You want me to say that now? <br/>Not right now. A little later. This will be a good test to see if Phillip does what he says  he's going to do. And if he does, he can start to earn his way back into the  rotation. If I get there tonight, and Phillip starts telling everybody  what I told him, Phillip will be sent packing. <br/>Jeff: Kristina, at the last tribal, a lot of attention  focused on you. You chose not to play the idol, which you are now wearing around  your neck. Even though everybody knew you had it, and you were on the hot  seat a little bit. <br/>Well, I just had a feeling that I shouldn't play it, that  I wasn't going to get all the votes. It was a really tough decision, though. <br/>Jeff: Do you have a feeling tonight as to whether or not  you're going to play it? <br/>Just a little one. Just a little one. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, I asked you before the challenge, does this  bring out the animal in you? And you said absolutely. <br/>The gorilla. A powerful animal. Won't attack unless provoked. The lion, one of the few animals that no animal, whether  starving to death, will approach. For me, that's how I feel about my family and my country. You do something to the united states, that full power is going  to come at you. You try to attack my family in any way, you get the lion, baby. <br/>Jeff: Now, what does the lion or the gorilla do to itself  if it feels it screwed up? <br/>I don't think a lion ever feels like it screws up, because  it kind of delivers. And a gorilla they either get beat down by another silverback,  because it's survivor of the fittest, or they don't lose, and I lost. And I need to suffer the consequences of that loss. <br/>Jeff: Boston Rob, what do you say to Phillip when he says,  "Look, it's all me." there's a whole group here. <br/>I think Phillip is a competitor. He takes it very personal and very hard. I can understand that because I'm a competitor, too. And I said, "Look, we win as a team. We lose as a team." but I understand how he feels. I'd internalize it and I'd feel like it was my fault, too. <br/>Jeff: So, Matt, you have somebody now saying vote me out. I deserve it. I lost this challenge. On the flip side, he's one of your biggest guys. <br/>I mean, he's a huge asset, even around camp. I mean, it's tough to consider voting someone out for a single  mistake. But in this game, it can happen as quickly as that, and so I'm  just really not sure at this point. There's a lot of uncertainty with this vote for some reason. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, to work so hard to get here, it can't be  easy to be on the verge of walking out of here. <br/>When I get to redemption island, I'm not going to lay down  and die because I'm going to have an opportunity to meet my nemesis. [ laughter ]  Jeff: Fran-ches-qwa. <br/>Nothing like a little payback. <br/>Jeff: You're looking forward if voted out tonight going to  redemption island. <br/>I would have love to have stayed but there is some upside. <br/>Jeff: Matt, are people spending much time talking about  redemption island, what it might be like, what they're going to have to  endure? <br/>The two main questions it's kind of focused around are how  many people come back from redemption island and at what time? <br/>Jeff: It would be great if you knew that. <br/>I mean, if we knew that, it would be a huge advantage. I mean, this rain is coming sideways right now, and we don't  want anybody out there by themselves, we really don't. But that's just "Survivor" I suppose. <br/>Jeff: It is one of the unique twists of this season of  "Survivor," and one of you is about to join Francesca on redemption  island. It is time to vote. Andrea, you're up. <br/>Kristina, for lying and being a manipulator, along with  your friend, Francesca. <br/>Are you kidding me? I hope you don't hold it against me, bud, and we'll see you on  the flip side. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden--  Jeff. I think I'm going to need a little extra help tonight. <br/>Jeff: Thank you. This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast against Kristina tonight will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote, Kristina. Does not count. Kristina. Does not count. Phillip. One vote Phillip. Phil. Two votes Phillip. Matt. Two votes Phillip, one vote Matt. Matt. We're tied. Two votes Phillip, two votes Matt. Matt. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: That's three votes Matt, two votes Phillip, one vote  left. Second person voted out of "Survivor: redemption  island," Matt. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Good work, guys. My goodness. <br/>Jeff: Matt, the tribe has spoken. You will have a second shot to get back in this game. Grab your torch. Head to redemption island. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Have fun. <br/>Damn, guys. <br/>Jeff: Only your second tribal council, and already a  vicious blindside. You guys are learning this game quickly. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor":  I'm still really pissed about what they did. <br/>Jeff: Rob finds out hell hath has no fury like Andrea  scorned. <br/>She'll cut my throat. <br/>Jeff: And the zapatera tribe finds out what happens when  you cross Russell. <br/>I'm dealing with a bunch of bitches. <br/>This is going to be the biggest blindside ever. <br/>I've been on an emotional roller coaster. Sometimes I feel like I just want to go home. And there are other times I think Rob just set me up to have the  greatest comeback in "Survivor" history. <br/>I'm shocked. <br/>I just have to stay strong and the lord will be with me.
