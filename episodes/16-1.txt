<br/>Jeff: We are flying over the beautiful islands of  Micronesia-- crystal-clear water, magnificent coral reefs, and one of the  most stunning collections of underwater sea life in the world. Just below me  are ten Americans who are about to begin the adventure of a lifetime. They  share only one thing in common-- they are all fans of Survivor. These fans  have finally been given the chance to be a contestant in their favorite game,  but they're completely unaware that they'll be playing against some of their  favorite Survivors from seasons past.  <br/>You could be a fan of the Boston Red Sox, man, but you  don't want to play against the Boston Red Sox. You're going to gets your ass  handed to you.  <br/>I played a perfect game last time. I consider myself the  greatest player in the history of the game.  <br/>Coming back I'm playing aggressively, and pretty much no  holds barred for me.  <br/>The only reason to come back is for the $1 million. That's  the only reason I will put up with a lot of suffering and bugs and smelly  people.  <br/>People at home watching identify with me. I'm like the  person at home watching on the coach, remember? I was the couch potato.  <br/>I can almost be on the fan's side. Because I'm a fan of  all these people. So for me to see, like, Yau and Ozzy over here was, like,  was crazy.  <br/>Everybody wants to beat me now, and hopefully I can tap  into that same kind of energy and will that I had last time.  <br/>Jeff: It is the ultimate game with a new twist-- ten of  Survivor'sbiggest fans taking on ten of their favorite players. For the next  39 days, they'll be forced to work together, creating a new society, while  battling the elements and each other. They must learn to adapt or they'll be  voted out of the game. In the end, only one will remain to claim the million-dollar  prize. 39 days, 20 people, one 39 days, 20 people, one Survivor! Survivor!

When we first  pulled in on the boat, it was a torrential downpour. One of my life dreams  has been to come out and try and survive in the wild, so this is really  incredible for me.  <br/>Jeff: So welcome to Micronesia.  <br/>I'm a fan, so coming to Survivorand starting up the game  on the beach with Jeff, you know, seeing him there, it was surreal.  <br/>Jeff: You guys want to know who you're playing  against?  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: Seeing how big a fans of Survivoryou are, it is only  fitting that you are going to compete against some of your favorite Survivors  from seasons past.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>Jeff: Come on out! Cirie from Exile Island.  <br/>This is cool for us to eat this like this, right?  <br/>Jeff: Come on out! Ozzy, from Survivor: Cook Islands. A  little less hair but the same Ozzy.  <br/>He's so high up there right now.  <br/>I know a lot about Ozzy simply in terms of competition. He  has owned almost all the challenges, but I myself am a track and cross  country runner. I think I have what it takes to compete at that level.  <br/>Jeff: Come on out. Ami from Survivor: Vanautau.  <br/>Hi, girlfriend.  <br/>Jeff: Come on out. Jonathan Penner.  <br/>Thank you!  <br/>If you want to mutiny, step off your mat and join the  other tribe.  <br/>Jeff: Come on out! Up next, Eliza from Survivor:  Vanuatu.  <br/>You've been trying to plot against me from day one.  <br/>For the last three freaking days you have been driving  everybody freaking nuts. Chill out!  <br/>Jeff: Come on out!  <br/>Jeff: Come on out!  <br/>From Survivor: China,James.  <br/>From Survivor: China,James.  <br/>When I saw James come around the corner, I got excited,  because he is, up until this season, the biggest and strongest that has ever  played the game. I think I can take him.  <br/>Jeff: Let's bring out the next member of your tribe. Come  on out. Parvati, from Survivor: Cook Islands.  <br/>Thank you, Jeff. I've got two naked guys in a hot  tub.  <br/>Jeff: Let's see who else is on this tribe. Come on out.  Come on out. Yau-Man from Survivor: Fiji. Yau-Man from Survivor: Fiji.  <br/>I'm about to jump out of my skin here! Blue turtle.  <br/>Jeff: The biggest round of applause so far, Yau-Man.  <br/>These are people I've watched on TV, and so there's that  certain awe about them, especially Yau-Man. I saw him come out with that  little Yau-Man hat and the little glasses. I love the Yau-Man.  <br/>Jeff: The next member of the favorites team, Amanda from  Survivor: China.  <br/>I have a really good idea. Get rid of James tonight. He  doesn't expect it right now.  <br/>Jeff: So we have ten fans, we have nine favorites. We are  one short. Let's bring out the last member of the Survivorfavorites team, the  most infamous of all survivors. Jonny Fairplay, who already looks  intoxicated.  <br/>My grandmother is not here for a reason. She's not  around.  <br/>Love the hat. Love the hat.  <br/>Jeff: So, Fairplay, are you dressing like me?  <br/>You want to know what you're playing for? [  laughter]  <br/>Jeff: I'm actually impressed. I like to know that you have  aspirations to get out of your current place in life. [ laughter]  <br/>Wow. Good to see you, Jeff. Always a pleasure.  <br/>I wanted to throw up when I saw Jonny Fairplay. He's a pig.  He's a loser pig. I would just love one moment to kick him, one moment to  kick him. One moment just to kick him hard in the shin.  <br/>Jeff: All right, fans, your tribe name is Airai. Take a  buff and put it on. Favorites, your tribe name is Malakal. Malakal. Take a  buff and put it on. Take a buff and put it on.  <br/>I think the fans versus favorites setup is the ultimate  challenge. Because we have the favorites who obviously have played this game  before, so they're coming in here with experience, but at the same time you  have us. And we know their game. We know not only their strengths but their  weaknesses, too. And so I think that puts us at a huge advantage.  <br/>Jeff: Just across the water on the other beach, there are  two boats, one for each tribe. Inside the boat is a map to your new home. One  other thing-- also across the beach there are two individual immunity idols,  one for each tribe. The first person to find the idol from each tribe gets  the idol. These are special idols. You can only play it the first time you go  to tribal council. time you go to tribal council. You can go anytime you  want. You can go anytime you want.  <br/>I worked my ass off to get across that stretch of water. I  beat Ozzy. And that's good. That's what I wanted to do. I needed to show him  what I'm I needed to show him what I'm made of. made of.  <br/>I'm thinking, "You know what? Take your time, Jonny  Fairplay. Slow and steady wins the race." I get there, has to be in  plain sight. It's on the boat. I grab it. Well, I grab the one from the Well,  I grab the one from the other boat. other boat. Yau-Man tackles my head into  the side of the boat.  <br/>Sorry! All these idols seem to like me, and I hope that  there will be other idols on the way this season and they will all like  season and they will all like me. me. Pick up that!  <br/>Thanks to Yau-Man, I have immunity for the very first  tribal council that we go to. tribal council that we go to. So I'm, like,  safe. So I'm, like, safe.  <br/>Trust me, Yau-Man's not America's hero like you think he  is. Even Jonny Fairplay wouldn't tackle someone's head into the side of a  boat for the immunity idol. Yau-Man is not nice. He sucks. So, as soon as  that idol is So, as soon as that idol is gone, see you later, bucko. gone,  see you later, bucko.  <br/>Here we go!  <br/>Get out. Hi, nice to meet you, buddy.  <br/>Chet, Jason. When we first pulled up to the beach it was  really exciting. You know, we are the fans of Survivor. So this is all of our  dreams to be out here. We definitely want to kick the favorites' ass.  <br/>We have arrived.  <br/>As in we have arrived.  <br/>Arrived, arrived.  <br/>How about Jonny Fairplay?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I'm a fan. I'm not somebody that just said, "Oh,  let's go be on Survivor."  <br/>Like, they all think they know how to do it and that,  like, the way they did it was right.  <br/>Exactly.  <br/>Now that we know we're playing the favorites, I mean, we  are out for blood.  <br/>We have the advantage, because we know how they play. They  don't know a damn thing about us.  <br/>All right, let's do something. our tribe consists of Big  Bird. We've got the southern princess. We've got the Incredible Hulk. We've  got Jon Bon Jovi in his prime. And then we've got Queer Eye for the Straight  Guy. Man, this is going to be a crew, let me tell you. It's on!  <br/>I think we need to do an elevated floor.  <br/>Wherever we build a shelter, we've got to clear it out.  we've got to clear it out.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Do you prefer gay? I don't even know the right word to  use.  <br/>You're cool so far. Go ahead. I don't get offended, so  don't worry.  <br/>Is gay okay?  <br/>That's fine. Sure.  <br/>It doesn't mean, like, you want to be a girl, right?  <br/>Oh, no, no, heavens no.  <br/>I knew Chet was a homosexual right away. You know, you  could just tell he is. Yeah, I don't have a problem with it. But I've never  been friends with a homosexual. I think I worked with somebody in the 1980s  bartending that was gay, but that's been about it. You know what? I hope you  can be my first gay man friend.  <br/>And I absolutely will.  <br/>Because I never had a gay man friend.  <br/>I bet you have and you just don't know.  <br/>Maybe.  <br/>Kathy definitely... she just kind of puts her foot in her  mouth sometimes.  <br/>I've never seen implants, ever. I've never seen them up  close.  <br/>Who said I have them?  <br/>She made... she made a comment about Tracy's boobs. And  I'm like...  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>The second the crazy lady found the immunity idol, I think  everyone was a little worried, because I think we all kind of felt as a  consensus that she was going to be its first one to go.  <br/>I'm sure I got off on the wrong foot. I guess sometimes it  pays to keep your mouth shut, but I keep your mouth shut, but I can't help  myself. can't help myself.  <br/>So here. Let's build a shelter before it Let's build a  shelter before it rains again. rains again.  <br/>The fact that we, the favorites, have played this game  before, I think that is our biggest advantage. And it's an expectation that  we've got to live up to.  <br/>Can we just make a pact right now that we're just going to  kick their asses?  <br/>Of course.  <br/>We should do our shelter as fast as possible.  <br/>It's just out in the open?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I mean, like, do we have people who know how to build a  shelter? Let's build a real shelter. Pretty crazy, fans versus favorites. We  always knew Jonny Fairplay was a favorite. Honestly, I think that's the  smartest place, but, you know, I'm not fighting anybody on anything. The  first time around I was just a single guy on the prowl. This go-around I've  got a girlfriend at home. She's seven months pregnant. Need to bring home  some money for her. So let's get to work. I just got a message in a bottle  saying my grandma died, so...  <br/>Not falling for that one again.  <br/>Are you kidding me? Look at how fast he is.  <br/>I know, it's insane.  <br/>I definitely appreciate the hard work that goes on around  this camp. It's so much nicer to have everybody pulling the rope and getting  everything together, helping each other and stuff. I almost wanted to give  somebody a hug, because it was really nice.  <br/>Nice, Ozzy! This is so much more pleasant than day one of  last time.  <br/>I know, right?  <br/>I mean, we all know what we're doing already, so, I mean,  the favorites should definitely have the advantage over the fans.  <br/>We're pretty much ready for palm fronds, right? palm  fronds, right?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I think we have a good group. I hope we win.  <br/>I think so, too. Everyone's already, like, bonding  together. I have to win this time. It's my second time. I'm not coming back  here to starve and be miserable. Do you want to get more fronds? I was the  flirt on Cook Islands and that was it. Like, there was no other dimension to  me at all, I don't think. Do you want a piggyback?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>[ laughing] Like, outwardly, I'm still going to be flirty,  but I'm playing smart this time. Like, I want to make the right alliances  with people that I know I can trust. Oh, look at that crab. [ screaming] And  this time there's only one guy to flirt with, really. It's the big guy,  James.  <br/>No, don't.  <br/>He has, like, a pincher on the bottom.  <br/>Parvati is definitely attractive. And she's... you know,  there's just something about her that... she's one of them sex kittenshe's  one of them sex kittentype girls, and I like it. type girls, and I like  it.  <br/>I will be... I'll be totally honest with you. If you saw  my season, you can know that when I say I'm going to stick to something and  do it...  <br/>Yeah. I... you know what? It's so funny that you're here,  because you're, like, one of my favorite players. I don't know, I think  that's really cool. I'd say I have pretty keen powers of observation, and  from what I can tell, Amanda and Ozzy have this rapport with one another  already.  <br/>And you're, like, the loyal one, you know? Like, I think  that's so awesome.  <br/>And ever since we got here, Parvati hasn't been able to  take her hands or eyes off of James. She is definitely going to have him  wrapped around her finger. So I think there definitely could be romance  bubbling between both Parvati and James and Amanda and Ozzy. And so that  makes all four of them very dangerous.  <br/>Good night, John Boy.  <br/>Good night, favorites.  <br/>Good night, favorites.  <br/>Good night, favorites.  <br/>Good night, favorites.  <br/>Palm fronds. Do we need anything more?  <br/>Yeah, let's put the fronds on the ground, too.  <br/>That's a good idea.  <br/>Is anybody over here?  <br/>Here comes another one.  <br/>Tonight is night number one, and we kind of took a little  too long to find a location to build our shelter, and it didn't come our  shelter, and it didn't come along as planned. along as planned. along as  planned.  <br/>Holy crap.  <br/>Holy crap.  <br/>Tonight's the first night here, and the downpour, it came  and it was hard, and it didn't stop. [ thunder] I hope by morning I feel a  whole lot better, because right now this sucks. this sucks. [ crying] [  crying]  <br/>I know you are.  <br/>I think that...  <br/>This would be awesome.  <br/>We would be a really good group.  <br/>Yeah, why don't we stick together starting now?  <br/>Starting now?  <br/>We're not supposed to scheme until tomorrow.  <br/>Come on, everyone else is scheming.  <br/>I love it.  <br/>Hands in, I'll do it.  <br/>I'll do it.  <br/>I'll do it.  <br/>All right.  <br/>I love you guys.  <br/>I love you guys! This is it.  <br/>Okay, done.  <br/>Ami, Yau-Man, Jonathan, and myself, the four of us are a  tight alliance. But the problem is, it seems like there's another foursome  out here, and that is Amanda and Ozzy and Parvati and James. We're very  concerned about that foursome. And we were worried they would try to pull in  Fairplay and Cirie. We need a fifth. We need a fifth.  <br/>I say Fairplay. Yeah.  <br/>Wait a minute.  <br/>Yeah. We have turn on him before he turns on us. turns on  us.  <br/>I don't trust him.  <br/>I don't trust him.  <br/>Okay. So who all do we have?  <br/>Us three.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>We can get James and Amanda for sure. One, two, three,  four, five.  <br/>We are a little wary of Eliza just hearing about the way  she played the game in Vanuatu. She's shifty, crafty. Some of us just feel  like we can't trust her.  <br/>I'm easy, man. Trust me.  <br/>I'm a little nervous because Fairplay's got his villain  persona to live up to, so maybe he will just betray everyone he can. I don't  know. But at this point, we need Fairplay to make a strong alliance.  <br/>Let's go swimming.  <br/>Good.  <br/>So we were productive.  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Jonny Fairplay is sitting back right now being friends  with everybody. I'm a very likable person. I'm a very nice person. I just  have the ability to lie very easily, which comes in handy here.  <br/>Hey, hey. James, Amanda, Ozzy, and Parvati are a done deal  alliance of four.  <br/>Absolutely.  <br/>Absolutely.  <br/>Absolutely.  <br/>So we need to make a counter.  <br/>So we need to make a counter.  <br/>They want what?  <br/>They want what?  <br/>Me.  <br/>Me.  <br/>Ozzy or Parvati. It doesn't matter to me.  <br/>I say Parvati first.  <br/>I say Parvati, too.  <br/>With Parvati still in, she can manipulate crap in the way  Ozzy could never... I think we should take Parvati out first. I think Parvati  is a much bigger threat as a social player than Ozzy is.  <br/>Fairplay pretends he's with them, and I act like  everything is perfect.  <br/>I'll play the game.  <br/>Fairplay's a gem to have on your alliance. He needs us  much more than we need him. You keep him around for as long as possible.  Hell, I'd take Fairplay to the end if I could. Do they think you are with  them?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I think it's insane that there's nine other of your  favorite Survivors of all time, and they all believe what I say. Have you not  watched the show Have you not watched the show before? before?  <br/>Yau-Man! Do you think you have enough sun you can start  with your glasses?  <br/>I can feel burning. I'm trying to focus the sun onto this  quote, unquote dry coconut husk with a drop of water on my glasses to act as  a magnifying glass. It's a very nice magnifying glass. The sun is almost  vertical enough that this should work. It worked in Fiji.  <br/>It's so warm.  <br/>I know. It's unbelievably warm.  <br/>It's like pee water.  <br/>Wow, it's burning.  <br/>Yeah, Yau-Man. Yeah. Yo, we need wood.  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>Oh, my god, they started it.  <br/>Woo!  <br/>Yea.  <br/>Good job, dude.  <br/>Yau-Man got our fire started miraculously. We're all very  excited. We have fire. We've been eating. We've been drinking. We're all well  rested, well hydrated, and we're ready to hydrated, and we're ready to kick  some butt. kick some butt. kick some butt.  <br/>I hope we have something.  <br/>I hope we have something.  <br/>We have tree mail.  <br/>Woo! Yes! Hey, guys, we've got tree mail!  <br/>Hey, we got tree mail.  <br/>Tree mail!  <br/>It's a puzzle.  <br/>Yeah, I love puzzles.  <br/>It says, "16 seasons later, you all should know the  deal. Outwit, outplay, outlast. Don't waste time reinventing the wheel."  <br/>I think everybody is, you know, biting at the bit just to  get in the game. And I think the favorites are chuckling at us right now,  saying that we're going to be a piece of cake, that they're going to walk all  over us.  <br/>"Don't reinvent the wheel" means don't be  stupid.  <br/>It means don't be too smart. Don't outthink  yourself.  <br/>They're not looking at us as competitors. But that's good.  Even better-- underdog, we'll Even better-- underdog, we'll take that role.  take that role. take that role.  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! Deja vu. Deja vu. [ laughter] [  laughter] So here we are, our first challenge. Eliza, you guys have played  this game before. Did you see the advantage you had now in getting a shelter  up quickly?  <br/>Jeff, have no idea how much of an advantage we have. Not  only do we have a shelter, but we have fire, we have food, we all have full  bellies. We are so excited and so pumped for this challenge, ready to kick  some butt.  <br/>We're doing three courses for every meal. It's ridiculous.  I'm getting fat. I have gained weight since I've been here.  <br/>Jeff: Joel, you buying all this?  <br/>No.  <br/>[ laughter]  <br/>You guys are dumber than you look.  <br/>But, hey, you know, if it is, good for them. They can get  fat and happy, and we can win the challenges.  <br/>Jeff: Here's how it works-- on my go, you must race to  assemble four wheels and place them on your cart. You must then push your  cart through a series of obstacles. When you reach the sand pit you must dig  up a bundle of planks. You'll use the planks to fill in gaps in the bridge.  Push your cart over your bridge to the finished platform, where you must then  take the wheels off of your cart and use them to complete a turnstile.  Finally, you'll use the turnstile to raise a fire wok, lighting the top of  the platform. First tribe to finish wins. You know to know what you're  playing for?  <br/>Yes!  <br/>Jeff: Immunity. When you have immunity in your possession,  you cannot be voted out. In addition, the winning tribe gets fire in the form  of flint. All right, give you a minute to strategize.  <br/>Come on, guys, right here. Right here.  <br/>Kick this some fan ass right now.  <br/>Jeff: Here we go, the first challenge of fans versus  favorites. Survivors ready? Go! Go!  <br/>Go, go, go, go!  <br/>Go, go, go, go!  <br/>Jeff: Have to assemble the four wheels, then put them on  your cart.  <br/>Come on, come on, come on, come on!  <br/>I got it, I got it, I got it.  <br/>Come on, guys, quickly, quickly!  <br/>Take your time.  <br/>Stand back and look at it.  <br/>Guys, guys, guys!  <br/>We got it.  <br/>Jeff: Fans have their four wheels.  <br/>Amanda, behind you! Behind you, Amanda!  <br/>Jeff: Favorites having no luck putting their four wheels  together.  <br/>Come on, guys. It's okay. Take your time! Calm down. Look  at it! Look at it!  <br/>All right, take your time.  <br/>Let's go!  <br/>Come on, guys! We've got this.  <br/>Jeff: The fans are off. Favorites still working.  <br/>Relax.  <br/>Jeff: Falling behind.  <br/>Look at that one.  <br/>Jeff: Fans extending their lead.  <br/>Come on!  <br/>We can still do it, you guys. We can still do it.  <br/>Jeff: Fans working through the obstacle. Jason, Joel,  Mikey B tearing it up.  <br/>One, two, three!  <br/>Here comes the cart, rolling over their tribe.  <br/>Not yet, not yet.  <br/>Go! Yes!  <br/>Jeff: Fans are through the obstacle. obstacle.  <br/>Go, go, go!  <br/>Go, go, go!  <br/>Jeff: Favorites have their cart. They are back in  this!  <br/>Whoa!  <br/>Jeff: An absolute wipeout for the favorites.  <br/>Are you okay?  <br/>Jeff: This challenge is falling apart for the  favorites.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Jeff: Fans still with a goodsized lead. They are now  digging up the planks. Favorites trying to get back on course after a big  wipeout.  <br/>These wheels aren't turning.  <br/>Come on, guys. We still can do this.  <br/>Go to your right. Go to your right a little bit.  <br/>Watch out for the tree!  <br/>Favorites starting to make up some ground.  <br/>Jeff: Fans have their planks out on the sand, got to untie  them. Here come the favorites. They're back in it! Dig! Dig, dig, dig!  <br/>Jeff: Erik giving a little greeting to the favorites,  trying to distract him while his tribe continues to work with the planks.  Fans are very much in control, taking their time.  <br/>Another one!  <br/>Jeff: Building their bridge.  <br/>James, you got this! Go, guys, go! Good job, guys.  <br/>Jeff: Fans first over the bridge! Favorites have their  planks! They're back in this!  <br/>Plank.  <br/>Plank, plank, plank.  <br/>Come on, let's go! Let's go!  <br/>Come on!  <br/>Jeff: Favorites are now building their bridge. Fans already  have their bridge completed.  <br/>Get out of the way! Get out of the way!  <br/>Jeff: And a wipeout into the tree. Favorites now taking on  their bridge. They're still in it.  <br/>Line it up, line it up!  <br/>Go, go, go!  <br/>Hurry!  <br/>Push!  <br/>Jeff: Favorites still trying to make their way over the  bridge.  <br/>One person at each place.  <br/>Jeff: Fans quickly get the wheels off their cart, and  they're working on the turnstile.  <br/>Go!  <br/>Go, go, go!  <br/>Jeff: Favorites are now down the bridge and making their  way! Fans working together very well.  <br/>Turn them around.  <br/>Pull the cart up!  <br/>Jeff: Got to finish the turnstile using the pieces of the  wheels. Fans getting closer. Favorites now quickly trying to work on their  puzzle.  <br/>Go!  <br/>Jeff: Fans have their turnstile complete. They've got to  raise the wok to the top of the platform. Favorites trying to get into this.  The first immunity challenge... The first immunity challenge... is won by the  fans! is won by the fans!  <br/>Jeff: Fans, congratulations. Immunity. Nobody going home  tonight. And fire in the form of flint. [ cheering]  <br/>Jeff: Favorites, you know this drill. Date with me tonight  at tribal council, where one of the favorites will have the distinction as  being the first person voted out of Fans versus Favorites. Grab your stuff.  Head back to camp. Head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. See you  tonight at tribal.  <br/>That sucked.  <br/>We tried hard, lost. no shame in losing. These fans are so  excited, so enthusiastic. I mean, they're playing Survivor. It's their dream.  And they just had more heart out there.  <br/>The loss, it's going to humble us and make us ready to  kick ass in the next one.  <br/>I may not swim as well as Ozzy, but I think I did pretty  good today.  <br/>Yeah, you did.  <br/>We're going to tribal council and gosh, I do not have a  plan at all. I have no idea what I'm going to do right now. I don't really  trust any of these people. I don't care. I'll get rid of anybody, as long as  it's not me.  <br/>What am I good at?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I think I'm good for morale, entertainment value. That's  about it. [ laughter] Right now, I could go either way and totally change the  game in two different directions. Two groups I'm playing are the four of  Yau-Man, Eliza, four of Yau-Man, Eliza, Jonathan, Ami. Jonathan, Ami.  <br/>Yep.  <br/>Yep.  <br/>And then you have the alliance of Ozzy, James, Parvati and  Amanda. They're after Eliza. So we'll see. People don't understand, like,  what crazy thing are you going to do? I'm like, how about the crazy thing is,  I don't do anything? I just want to see my girlfriend. That's it.  <br/>You must miss her really bad?  <br/>Yeah. She's seven months pregnant, and like, you know, I  don't know anything. I think about my girlfriend and my upcoming little girl  every single second out here, and I want to win this game for them. I can't  stop thinking that maybe there's something wrong with my little girl. [  crying] I'll tell you what, a million dollars is great. But having a healthy  little girl, that's the biggest prize I girl, that's the biggest prize I  could win right now. could win right now.  <br/>Shut up. You'll ruin our whole plan. You'll ruin our whole  plan. Maybe you should, though. Maybe you should, though.  <br/>What's that?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I don't know. I mean, it might be just too crazy, but I  came up with this little plan to distract Jonathan, Eliza, Yau-Man, and Ami  into voting for Fairplay, and we're all voting for Eliza, just because I  don't want Eliza turning around and trying to, you know, snake me.  <br/>I mean, having a kid is a pretty powerful thing.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>You know?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I'm just emotionally not here. So, I mean, I'm  sorry.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I'm just... I can't... you know.  <br/>Is there any way that I can talk you into staying  in?  <br/>No. I'm sorry.  <br/>Yeah, it sucks. Fairplay is a loose cannon. Fairplay said  to me that he wanted to go home. He just puts you on your serious stance  guard, because you don't know ever what he means.  <br/>He does not want to be here.  <br/>He doesn't want to stay?  <br/>He does not want to stay.  <br/>Or is he just saying that so we all vote for him and he is  with them? We've just got to be careful because he could pull a fast one.  I've just got to make sure he doesn't do anything crazy. I'm a little worried  that Fairplay is going to come together with James, Ozzy, Amanda, and  Parvati. All I know is tonight, tribal council is going to be crazy, because  if I know Jonny Fairplay, he is going to stir things up.  <br/>I'm ready. Let's battle! Let's battle! Tribal council!  Tribal council!  <br/>Jeff: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a  torch, approach the flame. This is part of the ritual of tribal council,  because in this game, fire represents your life. As long as you have that  fire, you're in the game. When your fire is gone, so are When your fire is  gone, so are you. you. Jonny Fairplay, you guys have all played this game.  Everybody here should come in fairly well versed in terms of what is  required. How did it go when you got to camp?  <br/>Cake. I mean, food is a lot easier here. We've made an  amazing shelter. So I think our only problem was, I'm guessing,  over-confidence.  <br/>Jeff: Eliza, let's talk about past reputations. How big a  factor are reputations coming into this game?  <br/>It's definitely a factor. I mean, whether or not somebody  says, "Oh, I'm just going to get to know you for you," it doesn't  matter. That's going to be in the back of their head. They're going to  remember the things you do, the moves you made, how you interacted with  people, and that's going to probably play a factor in the way people  vote.  <br/>Jeff: Jonny Fairplay, probably nobody in this game has a  bigger reputation than you.  <br/>I agree.  <br/>Jeff: Can that be an advantage?  <br/>Honestly, I think everyone here was kind of surprised with  the real Jonny Fairplay, I guess, and I can easily say I feel that all of  them trust me. But at the same time, like, my head's kind of screwed up right  now. I have a little baby on the way. And honestly, all I think about,  "Is my little baby Piper okay?" You know, like, that's all that  goes through my head. I'm like, you know, "Am I being a crappy dad by  being here?"  <br/>Jeff: But you're not a father yet.  <br/>Yeah, I'm this close. I mean, I had no idea that I was  going to think like this once I got here. I mean, I don't have a kid. I'm  about to have one, and guess what? It changes you. It changes your head. It  makes you crazy.  <br/>Jeff: So you want to go home, or you had a bad afternoon  and now you're trying to recover?  <br/>You know, last time I learned to be Jonny Fairplay and be  an ass [ no audio]. This time, you know, what? If I learn to be a good dad,  so be it. So I mean, I'm just... you know, my head is screwy right now.  <br/>Jeff: Why are you smiling, Yau-Man?  <br/>Well, because my first thought is, you know, what's the  scheme? It's a very strange thing to say to us suddenly just out of the  blue.  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy, is this just simply a case of Fairplay can't  hack it, it's much harder than he remembered, and he wanted to go home?  <br/>Jeff, I'll honestly tell you, no, I don't think so.  <br/>You can say what you want, Jeff. I don't need to put on a  little show for you. I mean, honestly, like, I'm screwy right now. You know,  emotions are going crazy in my head, and that's it. And it wasn't supposed to  be this difficult.  <br/>Jeff: Jonathan, Fairplay has a reputation of pulling scams  and lying. Just to be clear, what is he doing?  <br/>I think he's asking us to vote for him. I think, you know,  somebody has to go home. Somebody wants to go home. And he's going to go  home.  <br/>Jeff: So it's a quit?  <br/>This is not a quit.  <br/>Jeff: Forgive my skepticism, but last time you cried over  a dead grandma who conveniently was at home watching on TV.  <br/>I understand.  <br/>Jeff: Yes or no answer-- is this a quit? Eliza?  <br/>No.  <br/>Jeff: This is not a quit?  <br/>There is still a possibility in my mind that Fairplay is  not going home tonight. I mean, I don't think there's one person who didn't  bring their stuff with them. So we're still voting.  <br/>Jeff: Oh, we are voting. All right, Yau-Man, you have the  immunity idol. It is only good tonight. You can use it for yourself...  <br/>No, I'm keeping it.  <br/>Jeff: All right, you cannot vote for Yau-Man. Everybody  else, including Mr. Fairplay, is fair game. It's time to vote. It's time to  vote. Ami, you're up. Ami, you're up.  <br/>Jonny I've got to vote for you. You've asked me to.
