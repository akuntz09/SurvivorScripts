<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor,Dreamz had to decide between two  alliances: the four horsemen or Earl, Yau-Man, and Cassandra. <br/>I can never tell how the game is going to go, so I'm going to just see how it  plays out. <br/>Probst: First, Dreamz warned Alex that he was on the chopping block. <br/>Alex, your name's going to come up tomorrow. <br/>Probst: But Earl caught Dreamz red handed. <br/>You know I heard what y'all was saying, right? <br/>Probst: Feeling the pressure from Earl's alliance, Dreamz dropped a bomb  about the four horsemen. <br/>Mookie's got an immunity idol. <br/>There are two hidden immunity idols. The one in the Moto camp was dug up by me. <br/>Probst: In their first individual immunity challenge... Yau-Man looks like he  could go all day. ...Yau-Man obliterated the competition. Boo is out of the challenge. Yau-Man wins first individual immunity. Before tribal council.... <br/>Mookie wants to get rid of Earl first. Are you in? <br/>Probst: ...Alex tried to recruit Stacy to join the four horsemen...  I'm just hot. I'm really agitated. <br/>She was like, "I'm just tired. I'm just hot right now."  That means that she's not in, dude. <br/>Probst: ...which put Alex at risk. <br/>I can save Alex by giving him the immunity idol, but this early in the game  to use the immunity idol is kind of a disadvantage. <br/>Probst: Mookie reluctantly passed his hidden immunity idol to Alex in order  to save him. <br/>It's going to work, Mook. It's going to work. <br/>Probst: And together, they targeted Cassandra. <br/>This is an all-or-nothing move. If it works out, it'll probably be one of the best moves ever. <br/>Mookie gave Alex the idol. <br/>Probst: Dreamz let his new alliance know of the four horsemen's plan. <br/>He gave it to him? <br/>I promise. <br/>Listen-- Mookie, Mookie. Mookie gave the idol to Alex, so we're going to vote Mookie just to catch  them off guard. <br/>Why don't we vote off Edgardo? <br/>Probst: But unwilling to fully trust Dreamz, the vote switched to Edgardo. <br/>If we hit them with Edgardo, that hits them from the left side. <br/>Yeah, I've thought about it. <br/>Probst: And at tribal council, Alex confidently played Mookie's idol. Alex is immune from tonight's vote. Alex, Mookie, and Edgardo were certain their plan was working, but when the  votes were revealed... Tenth person voted out and the fourth member of our  jury... ...the rug was pulled out from under them, and Edgardo was voted out. Edgardo, the tribe has spoken. Eight are left. Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I thought Dreamz would be more on par with the four horsemen alliance, but I  guess not. He's the one that turned and back-stabbed us. back-stabbed us. I mean, it hurts. I mean, it hurts. <br/>Everybody made a pact to vote out Mookie, and then all of a sudden they  switched to Edgardo. So I was the only one who voted Mookie. At first I felt like they didn't trust me, but then they came to me and they  let me know that they just changed it just in case Mookie pulled out the  immunity idol. And I was comfortable after And I was comfortable after that. that. <br/>That was brilliant. Now the power is pretty much on our side, and I feel good. There ain't no more secrets now. We're actually six strong, and there's two people just waiting there's two  people just waiting on death row. on death row. on death row. [ theme song playing] [ theme song playing]  ...come over and say something. <br/>Like "Hey, guys, you know, like, it's a game." like, it's a  game."  A true traitor. <br/>A true traitor. <br/>Why are y'all not hanging out no more? no more? <br/>Why do you think? <br/>Why do you think? <br/>I'm still hanging out. <br/>We all got outwitted? What are you talking about? <br/>We all got outsmarted last night. <br/>Dude, you turned on us. <br/>No, I didn't turn on y'all. <br/>How do you figure? <br/>I didn't turn on y'all. <br/>There were three votes for Cassandra. <br/>No, I didn't turn on y'all. That's not even in me. <br/>Why didn't you go with Cassandra anyway? <br/>Why didn't I go with Cassandra anyway? <br/>Yeah, that would have been a 4-4 split. <br/>It would have been 4-4, and that was the end of it. We said Cassandra, and that was it. <br/>That was the end of it. As soon as you voted for Edgardo, that was the end of us. <br/>What? <br/>Or you voted for me? <br/>Who'd you vote for, Mookie or Edgardo? <br/>I voted Mookie. I didn't throw Mookie's random name out randomly and turn on y'all. But I knew once they had us gone, it's me trying to go with them. It's not me turning on y'all ever, ever. I walked over to Mookie and Alex and said, "I guess we just got  outplayed," because I want them to think that it wasn't my fault that it  happened. I pretty much told them a story about me not knowing about what was going on. I didn't turn. <br/>That's the only thing that was upsetting to me. If I get jacked, I get jacked. But to be turned on, I was like, "Man, I can't believe that guy turned  on me."  I didn't go, "Oh, yeah, Alex got the immunity idol, don't vote for him;  vote for Edgardo."  Is there a way out of this right now? <br/>One of y'all win the challenge. All y'all can do now is win challenges. As fast as I'm trying to get them out of here, I still want to be their  friends, because I'm going to need their vote in the future if I one of the final  two. I got a headache and everything I got a headache and everything at tribal  council. at tribal council. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! For today's challenge, you're going to be randomly divided into two teams. One person from each team will be on a platform. You will be launching balls out into the field, where your teammates will  run, slide, or dive in the mud, attempting to catch the ball using a catch  basket. Each time you catch a ball, you score a point. It doesn't matter what color ball you catch. You catch a ball, you score a point. First team to five wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Some items to get you nice and clean. Trust me, all eight of you need this desperately. You will not take this back to camp to get clean, though. You will take this basket. You will board a seaplane. The seaplane will fly you to a luxury spa resort. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: When you arrive, you'll take a shower, put this Olay ribbons body  wash to use. You'll then spend the night, get a good night's sleep in a bed, return to  camp in the morning. In addition, the winning team will send one person from the losing team to  Exile Island. The person who goes to Exile will find a new clue to the location of the  hidden immunity idol, which has been rehidden since Alex played it at the  last tribal council. All right, we're going to randomly draw for teams, and randomly draw for  teams, and we'll get started. we'll get started. Here we go. For the orange team, it is Yau-Man launching balls to Boo, Cassandra, and  Mookie. For the green team, launching the balls is Stacy. Out in the field, it is Dreamz, Earl, and Alex. Let's get this challenge started. Three, two, one, fire. Yau-Man launches deep, nobody going to get it. Stacy waiting. She launches. Everybody going for it. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Earl has it, and he loses it-- no points. <br/>I didn't know they bounced like that. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one, launch. launch. Boo scores for orange! Boo scores for orange! Mookie steals it for the orange team. <br/>Sorry, sorry. <br/>Probst: Quickly, orange leads two-zip. two-zip. Three, two, one, fire. Three, two, one, fire. Alex makes a diving attempt but cannot hold on to it. <br/>Good try. <br/>Probst: What did I miss? <br/>Choke hold. <br/>Probst: This is up to you guys to figure out how physical you want to get. Ready, aim, fire. Ready, aim, fire. Yau-Man goes short for Boo. Yau-Man goes short for Boo. Stacy high and deep. Dreamz has a shot. Dreamz connects for green! Orange leads now 2-1. Three, two, one, fire. Stacy launches deep for Dreamz. Mookie almost steals it! Yau-Man launches deep. <br/>Ow! Ow! Ow! <br/>Are you all right? <br/>Probst: What happened, Boo? <br/>Ow! [ Boo groaning]  Probst: What happened, Boo? <br/>I think it's my ACL or something. <br/>Take your time. Take your time. [ Boo groaning]  Probst: Let's bring medical in. in. [ Boo groaning] [ Boo groaning]  In the back? <br/>In the back? <br/>Yeah, yeah, right in there. <br/>Yeah, yeah, right in there. <br/>Yeah, yeah, right in there. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Oh, man.

Let's go! <br/>Probst: You want to keep going? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: All right. <br/>It was painful. That's all. It's gone. The pain subsided. <br/>Probst: Boo going to keep going. Three, two, one, fire. Boo battling for it and loses Boo battling for it and loses it! it! Dreamz scores for green! <br/>Yau! <br/>Probst: We are now tied 2-2. Three, two, one, fire. Stacy's in the air. Yau-Man goes short. Mookie connects! Orange back in the lead. Three, two...  Earl, get physical! <br/>I am physical.

Boo almost had it. <br/>Come on, man! <br/>Probst: We are tied 3-3. <br/>Probst: We are tied 3-3. Three, two, one, fire. Three, two, one, fire. Three, two, one, fire. Alex has a shot at it. Alex has a shot at it. Yau-Man going way left to Mookie. <br/>Yay! <br/>Probst: Orange leads now 4-3. We are at game point. Orange scores one more point, they're going to a spa. <br/>Yau, patience. Just watch the break. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one, fire. Yau-Man goes right back to the same target. Alex steals it for the green Alex steals it for the green team. team. Stacy goes deep for Dreamz.

Earl, Dreamz, Alex, and Stacy Earl, Dreamz, Alex, and Stacy going on a spa  reward. going on a spa reward. All right first big decision, Alex, Stacy, Dreamz, and Earl, you have to send  one person to Exile Island. <br/>Boo. <br/>He's been living the life of luxury since he's been here, so he has to go. <br/>Probst: Boo, head on out. The boat will pick you up. <br/>Good luck, Boo. <br/>Probst: Big reward. <br/>Big, huge! <br/>Probst: Come grab your stuff. Head on out this way. The seaplane will pick you up. <br/>Right now? <br/>Probst: You're going dirty,  Probst: You're going dirty, just like this. just like this. <br/>"The idol is back at your very own beach. It's close to a singular tree and easy to reach." It's not here. It's not my beach. That makes it a lot easier for me here, because I don't want to do anything. I hurt my knee, and it's painful. I'm out of water right now. I'm nearing heat exhaustion. Man, I cannot be in the sun anymore. anymore. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. <br/>It's great. The first thing I'm going to do when I get to this reward is see if I can  wiggle my way back into this alliance. I mean, I'm certainly in a bad position, and I feel like odds are against me. <br/>Bula-Bula! <br/>Bula-Bula! <br/>Bula! <br/>But, hey, I'm definitely  But, hey, I'm definitely going to give it my all. going to give it my all. <br/>Hey, let's go ahead and get sexy back. sexy back. We got the showers. We got the showers. <br/>There's, like, so much dirt in so many places, I don't know what to do. <br/>Warm water. <br/>Oh, wow, this feels great. <br/>I have mud under my arms. How crazy is that? Mud! <br/>Time to Olay-- Olay, Olay. Oh, my God, I'm clean again, like human. <br/>I don't know, Alex. I think I'm getting my sexy back. <br/>Thank you very much. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Looks good, smells good. <br/>Enjoy. <br/>Getting the reward was good, and it was definitely good for morale. <br/>I'm going to do the cheese platter and that as well. <br/>But it was extremely awkward to have Alex there. <br/>I mean, you've seen how I play this game. Whether I win or lose, I congratulate the other team, and I try to minimize,  like, the showboating. showboating. <br/>Sometimes. <br/>Sometimes. <br/>A lion is most dangerous when he's wounded and backed up against a wall. That's how I feel, because I'm clearly on the chopping block. So if I can buy myself a couple people off, that might give me more time to  try to maybe infiltrate the alliance. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! So can I ask you a question, Earl? <br/>Sure. <br/>So what's the order, Mookie and I? <br/>That information probably wouldn't be revealed, because the game isn't over. <br/>Fair enough. <br/>Can't be stupid. <br/>Fair enough. <br/>I'm assuming you want to go second. second. <br/>I think Mookie wants to go. <br/>I think Mookie wants to go. <br/>Sounds reasonable to me. But I've come to terms with the way I've played the game so far, and I'm  happy. Obviously, I'm at a disadvantage, but I don't care. I'm not going down without a fight, you know, and they the better be prepared  forward me to better be prepared forward me to bring it at this point. bring it at this point. <br/>Get out of our seats! We're ready to get on! <br/>So fresh and so clean. <br/>We can smell you from here! <br/>Clean, washed, pressed. <br/>When the people came back from the spa reward, they smelled like apples and  strawberries. <br/>Let me smell you! Let me smell you! <br/>I know, I smell good. <br/>Yes, their trip was great, but I just hate hearing it. You're back to your standard of living you're used to, dirt. At this point, I'm already x'd out of the equation of everyone, but even  though I seem like I'm out of the game, I'm just completely out, my heart is  still going, and my mind is still going, and my mind is constantly just  thinking. constantly just thinking. I think Yau-Man found it. <br/>The idol. <br/>Yau-Man found it because he's the only person that's ever at camp. <br/>Ever. <br/>Ever. <br/>Always by the fire. <br/>And he's always by the fire, and he always has time, so he has it. When your back is against the wall, you start being creative. And I thought, "Hmm, the idol, I wonder who really has the idol."  So I decided, "Well, Yau-Man's fishing, the first time he's ever been  away from camp; I might as well go check his bag to see if there's anything  in there," just being curious. Where's Yau-Man's bag? Did he take it with him? This is it right here? Yup, he has it. <br/>Are you serious? <br/>Yeah, he's got it. It's right here. It's right here. Look. Look. <br/>What can we do with that information? Do we blow up his spot? <br/>We can do something with this information. <br/>We can do something with this information. Let's go think what is the most damage we can cause. <br/>I'm doing this because you and me are the last two girls. <br/>This is to a long and prosperous game together. <br/>Cheers. <br/>That's why you don't hide the immunity idol in your bag. [ laughter]  I hear somebody coming. <br/>It's Yau-Man's best interest not to align himself with us, though, because we  know he has it. Because there's no reason why he would tell anybody yet, right? <br/>There's nothing for his position. How are you going to convince everyone that Yau-Man has the idol? <br/>Let's think about that. <br/>Say, "I went in his bag. He has the idol." "You guys went fishing, I went in his bag, he has  the idol, in his bag, he has the idol, period." period."  He wears those pants to tribal all the time. "Yau-Man, do you have the idol?" He's like, "No, I don't have  the idol." "Pull your pants out and show everyone here that you  have the idol if you're so confident."  Just blow up his spot at tribal. <br/>Right there, be like, "Throw it up." At tribal council, that's like...  if you blew him up on the spot like that, and he had it in his pocket, and  then he lied to everyone saying he didn't have it...  They would vote with us. <br/>Exactly. <br/>God, it's going to be so great! Even if we get voted off, Mook, it's going to feel so great! That's going to feel so... ah! That's going out swinging, literally a blaze of glory. <br/>Scarface. <br/>Scarfacestyle. <br/>Two great brains working together, strategizing, we're on top of the world. <br/>Ah, brilliant. <br/>We devised this huge plan of maybe we can bring up the idol to everyone and  surprise them at tribal council, then people won't be able to talk to each  other and people will be paranoid; they don't know what to do. It's going to be an interesting tribal council, let me tell you that. <br/>It is. [ laughter] [ twig breaks]  What? <br/>Stacy and Cassandra are right there. <br/>We're screwed. That's it. They're going to tell Yau-Man. <br/>There goes that plan. <br/>Damn it, dude! <br/>Right now the biggest thing is we need to blow his spot up. <br/>We blow up his spot before tribal council. tribal council. <br/>We blow it up now. <br/>We blow it up now. <br/>We got to hurry up and go there then, before they go. there then, before they go. Time to raise some hell. Time to raise some hell. <br/>Once I saw Stacy and Cassandra listening to our conversation, I came up with  a little idea that if we can get back to Yau before them and kind of give him  an ultimatum, that we can somehow use that information against him in his  information against him in his alliance. alliance. <br/>I think they may be a little paranoid, thinking we were eavesdropping in on  them. <br/>Cassandra and I happened to be sitting nearby where Mookie and Alex were  having a conversation that they spoke about a few things that we didn't hear. We heard, like, words here and there. So then they went running back So then they went running back to camp. to camp. <br/>Now, do you want to tell the group yourself, or do you want us to do it? us to do it? <br/>Why do I have the idol? <br/>Why do I have the idol? <br/>I thought you guys were getting firewood. <br/>No. <br/>So what do you want to do, Yau? <br/>You guys do what you need to do. <br/>Okay, we will. <br/>All right. <br/>So we go to Yau-Man, and he was shocked. I definitely saw it in his eyes, like, "Holy crap." He's not going  to be able to now use the idol the way he wanted to. So that still makes him more of a target than it did before. a target than it did before. It'll be interesting, won't it? It'll be interesting, won't it? <br/>Earl is the only one who knows I have the idol. At this point, it doesn't change any outcome, because my voting bloc members,  we already have decided, we have the majority to continue the sequence that  we are going to. It changed somewhat for me, personally, because having that information that  early put me at risk. So I will have to tell all my So I will have to tell all my voting bloc just  straight out. voting bloc just straight out. <br/>He went through your bag, Yau-Man? <br/>He went through my bag. They're trying to threaten me, basically. He didn't say that. He implies that, pretty much. <br/>My heart is, like, hurting right now. Alex went through Yau-Man's things, his bag, his pants, and then threatened  him. <br/>He threatened you? <br/>He threatened him and said, "I know you have the immunity idol."  He looked at me and said, "I saw it in your pants. What are you going to do about it?"  Yau went and told everybody that they went through everybody's bags and they  found the idol. <br/>To go through people's personal stuff and then to try to bully you? <br/>Yeah. <br/>People were pissed that they went through Yau's personal things, not about,  "Okay, Yau has the idol."  That's dirty. That's dirty. <br/>But it sucked to me just because someone knew, because I like keeping  everything quiet in general. That's just... because too many people knowing about things, bad things  happen. <br/>Who went through your bag, though? <br/>I don't know who, but they did, because I just checked. My pants are all ruffled up, and I usually fold it nicely. <br/>Finding out that Yau-Man had the immunity idol changed a whole bunch of  stuff, because everybody with an immunity idol is considered dangerous. Me, Cassandra, and Stacy know that. Everybody else is going to be on a whole different level. It's going to change a whole It's going to change a whole bunch of stuff. bunch of stuff. <br/>You know what? At least it caused them some dissension. That's what we wanted. You know what I mean? <br/>The worst thing that can happen is either Alex or Mookie wins the next  immunity challenge, and somehow they manage to get Dreamz and Boo to their  side. Then it will be a 4-4 split. And if we lose that 4-4 split, And if we lose that 4-4 split, it may be  downhill for me. it may be downhill for me. it may be downhill for me. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Boo returning from Exile Island. <br/>My tribe mates, my friends, how y'all doing? <br/>Probst: First thing's first. Yau-Man, I'll take back the necklace. Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. Today's challenge requires a strong memory and a lot of strategy. You will each secretly select your own block of three squares on a grid. They must line up either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Then you're going to attempt to knock out your opponents by selecting  coordinates and bombing squares one by one. The object of the game is to knock out all of the squares of your tribe mates. The last person to still have a square left on the grid wins immunity,  guaranteed a one-in[1]seven  shot at winning this game. Losers go to tribal council tonight. Somebody will be going home. Anything not clear? We'll get your positions, and we'll get started. All right, Stacy has secretly selected her block of three squares, as has  Yau-Man, Mookie, Cassandra, Dreamz, Boo, Alex, and Earl. Okay, so you all know your own spots. You don't know anybody else's. So this is a little bit of a guess and a lot of memory. Dreamz, you're up first. Fire away. <br/>D-3. <br/>D-3. <br/>Probst: D-3 is a hit. <br/>Probst: D-3 is a hit. Oddly enough, Dreamz hits himself, while also hitting Earl himself, while  also hitting Earl and Boo. and Boo. Cassandra. <br/>C-3. <br/>Probst: That is a hit. That is a hit on Yau-Man and Cassandra. Cassandra blew up one of her own positions on the target. Mookie. <br/>Uh... E-4. <br/>Probst: E-4 is a hit. Earl takes his second hit. Earl, make a selection. <br/>B-4. <br/>Probst: B-4 is a good hit. Earl hits Alex, Mookie, and Cassandra, who now has only one square left. Yau-Man, make your choice. <br/>C-2. <br/>Probst: That is a hit. Dreamz and Boo both take their second hit, and Earl takes his third hit. Earl is out of the game. Stacy. <br/>B-1. <br/>Probst: B-1 is a hit. Boo takes a hit, and Dreamz takes a hit. And with that selection, Stacy, you've knocked both Boo and Dreamz out. Take a spot on the mat, guys. Alex. <br/>D-2. <br/>Probst: D-2 is a miss. Cassandra, your choice. <br/>Can I have A-4, please? <br/>Probst: Miss. Mookie. <br/>A-5. <br/>Probst: A-5 is a hit. Cassandra takes her third hit. Cassandra, you're now out of the challenge. Yau-Man, chance to do some damage. <br/>C-5. <br/>Probst: Mookie takes a hit and Stacy takes a hit. Mookie now with one square left. Alex. <br/>B-5. <br/>Probst: miss. Stacy. <br/>A-4. <br/>Probst: A-4 has already been picked. It's a miss. Memory is starting to play an important role in this game as we get further  and further into it. Mookie, your choice. <br/>C-4. <br/>Probst: That is a hit. Alex takes a hit. Alex now has one square left. Yau-Man, your choice. <br/>A-3. <br/>Probst: That is a hit. Mookie takes his third hit. Mookie now joins Earl, Dreamz, Cassandra, and Boo. We are down to three people left: Alex, Yau-Man, Stacy. Alex has one square left, Yau-Man and Stacy each with two. Alex, a chance to do some damage. <br/>E-5. <br/>Probst: E-5 is a hit. It is a hit on Yau-Man. Yau-Man and Alex each with one square left. square left. Stacy. Stacy. <br/>D-4. <br/>D-4. <br/>Probst: Stacy says D-4. <br/>Probst: Stacy says D-4. D-4 is a hit. Everybody takes a hit. A good strategic move, as Stacy hits herself but, in the process, takes out  both Yau-Man and Alex. Stacy wins individual immunity. Stacy wins individual immunity. [ applause] [ applause] Stacy, safe at tonight's tribal council. Somebody going home. Somebody going home. Head on out. Head on out. <br/>I'm not going to share with them... if you can imagine. But eat that. That'll help keep your energy up. I'm definitely up against the wall, right? I don't have very many moves left, but I'm just not... I'm not going to go  down without a fight. I'm don't think I'm going to go that quietly, just so you know. <br/>And right now, we have nothing to be but honest. <br/>We have nothing to be but honest, exactly. So I'm going to be completely honest. <br/>Cause some hell. <br/>Just cause some hell, man. If I'm going down, I'm bringing hell with me. I'm a lawyer. I know what it's like to negotiate with people. I know what it's like to use information strategically, which I've been doing  all along. You know, it's very clear. Hey, Yau-Man can't be trusted. So at tonight's tribal council, I'm going to point it out as "Hey, these  are the people you've aligned yourself with. you've aligned yourself with. Draw your own conclusions." Draw your own conclusions." Draw your  own conclusions."  Why take a chance? <br/>Why take a chance? <br/>Okay, okay, fine, all right, whatever, we'll do...  Everybody give it some thought. <br/>Boo came back from Exile Island, and he had one clue to the hidden immunity  idol, and I think Boo somehow convinced Cassandra or whoever that Alex or  Mookie may have found it somehow. They're afraid that Alex will pull another one out. So they're going to try and So they're going to try and spread the vote out. spread the vote out. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>People want to do three votes Mookie and three votes Alex, and the reason for  that was just you never know what might pop up. That will make it a tie at tribal council. So at that point, we can make a choice. We know that no magical idol has been played, because there won't be anything  played, and we can say okay, "It's going to be Alex, that's who is going  to go," because that is who's going to go. <br/>Ready? One, two, three. <br/>I'm against doing a split vote, but you know, I do what makes people feel  comfortable. I'm not going to sit there and say, "No, guys, we're going to do  this," because that would be do this," because that would be the  wrong approach. the wrong approach. <br/>Tonight's tribal council, Mookie and I are going out swinging. And if that doesn't work, I think my best bet is to just try to stay alive  past this vote. I've got one vote, and I better I've got one vote, and I better make it count. make it count. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the jury: Rocky, Lisi, Michelle, and Edgardo,  voted out at the and Edgardo, voted out at the last tribal council. last tribal council. Let's start with the reward challenge. Alex, did you sense the game shift at all? There were a lot of physical match-ups, a lot of people yelling at each other. <br/>I don't know if it changed the game, but it definitely revealed something  about the way people are willing to play games, you know, if they're more  likely to rub mud in someone's eyes or trip somebody. And as Dreamz pointed out last tribal council, the rats and the snakes came  out of the woodwork. <br/>Probst: Mookie, what did you notice from that challenge? <br/>I think, to some extent, we respect each other. But then, when it comes down to the game and how are you going to win, it's a  little different. I mean, there's two sides to the story there. <br/>Probst: Tell me about the other side. <br/>There are alliances, and one alliance was completely destroyed at the last  tribal council, maybe some back stabbing and maybe some trickiness on the  other alliance's part. But at that point, you feel yourself just being an outsider to an alliance. <br/>Probst: So, Mookie, what do you do? <br/>You know, Alex and I, we realized our backs are against the wall with no way  out. You know, we've come up with some kind of way we can possibly get out, and  that was through an immunity idol that we found in one of the... in Yau-Man's  bag. <br/>Probst: Hold on, you found an immunity idol in Yau-Man's bag. <br/>Correct. <br/>Probst: Found it? <br/>Well, it was in his bag, yeah. <br/>Probst: This is coming on the heels of Alex saying the snakes and the rats  came out. That's about as snaky-ratty as it gets, going through somebody's personal  belongings. Yau-Man, is that fair-- that "If you're going something in your bag and  leave, you better know I might look through it"? <br/>Well, the expectation is there's some privacy, but on the other hand, you  know, it's a desperation move, and besides, it won't affect the outcome of  the game for the next few rounds. <br/>Probst: Well, that's a bold statement. It won't affect the game for the next few rounds? <br/>Couple rounds at least. I may have to change my strategy a little bit, if I, you know, intend to use  it at some point. <br/>Probst: Earl, what was the reaction when this all went down? <br/>I was pissed. Like, for one thing, I can say that this tribe, no one's going through  anybody's stuff. That just hasn't been going on. So when I heard that, you know, I was pissed off. <br/>Probst: Dreamz, how big an issue is trust?-- because it's hard to know who  has been lying all along. <br/>My take on this is if they're both on the chopping block, after they're gone,  it's still going to be six of us left. So we're going to split up too. So I'm trying to find out where I stand. <br/>Probst: Alex, are there people coasting in this game that are threats and  aren't seen as threats? <br/>Yeah. And at this point, if Mookie and I are gone, and there are six people left,  and they have to look at each other-- so whatever they did to get to that top  six is going to come back and bite them in the ass. Karma has a funny way of working in this game, Jeff, and it's pretty  immediate. You know, whatever will be will be, but word to the wise: remember past  actions, because they foretell the future. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. Based on tonight's tribal council, we know there is another hidden immunity  idol in play. Whoever has it, if you need to use it tonight, you would present it to me  before I read the votes. Stacy, you have individual immunity. Are you going hold on to it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: You cannot vote for Stacy. Everybody else is fair game. Time to vote. Time to vote. Earl, you're up. Earl, you're up. <br/>Nothing personal. <br/>Nothing personal. Someone needs to go. Someone needs to go. <br/>Just trying to stay in this another day, buddy. another day, buddy. Good luck. Good luck. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If you have the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, idol and you  want to play it, now is the time to do so. now is the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. First vote: Alex. Alex. Two votes Alex. Mookie. Boo. One vote Boo. Mookie. That's two votes Mookie, two votes Alex, one vote Boo. Mookie. That's three votes Mookie. Alex. We're tied. Three votes Mookie, three votes Three votes Mookie, three votes Alex, one  vote left. Alex, one vote left. Eleventh person voted out and the fifth member of our jury, Mookie. Mookie. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Mookie, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Probst: Well, based on what I heard tonight, it sounds like there's one very  strong group of six and Alex, which means Alex is either odd man out or  suddenly very valuable. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor,Alex goes undercover. <br/>I'm trying to make sure I'm not seen or heard, kind of like a ninja right now. <br/>Probst: Boo annoys everyone. <br/>He talks more than the girls talk. <br/>Y'all know what I was thinking. I was like, "Would you shut up? Why don't you stop saying stupid stuff?"  Probst: And the reward challenge gets primal. challenge gets primal. This is a free-for-all. This is a free-for-all. <br/>You know, I'm pretty relieved that I'm out of the game, but at the same time,  it would have been nice to still be in the game had the alliances stayed put  for me. And I wish I could be back there, raising hell, making everyone's lives  miserable, as miserable as my life has been here. It's kind of like grass is green on the other side. You know, it's unfortunate that I'm out of the game, but it was a great  experience, and I wouldn't take it back for wouldn't take it back for  anything.
