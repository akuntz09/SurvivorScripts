<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor...  I'm in control of this game. Everything has worked for me so far. I set up my alliance so strong. My people-- they come up to me, they tell me everything. <br/>Probst: By day 30, Russell was driving on cruise control, mowing down anyone  who got in his way. <br/>Now I can comfortably sit on my throne and watch everybody bicker at each  other. <br/>Probst: He felt so comfortable that he let his guard down and revealed a  guard down and revealed a secret. secret. Meanwhile, Shambo had what she thought was a psychic vision. <br/>I had a dream last night we voted Dave off. <br/>Probst: So she immediately decided that's what everyone had to do. <br/>I am definitely in a position of power. Dave is so gone. <br/>Probst: But Russell decided that John was the one who needed to go, so he  told everyone but Shambo to switch their votes. <br/>The best way to do this...  Uh-huh. <br/>...is John. It will be you if it's not John. <br/>Probst: Jaison was worried about going against Shambo's wishes because her  vote is critical to keeping a majority. <br/>You piss off Shambo and she's going to go to the other side. <br/>Probst: But at Tribal Council, Jaison and everyone but Shambo followed  Russell's lead. Tenth person voted out and the fourth member of our jury-- John. Eight are left. Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Wow. John was majorly blindsided, as was I. I had no idea they were voting John. The plan was to vote Dave, and I The plan was to vote Dave, and I am  positively stunned. am positively stunned. Okay. <br/>So he was trying to get rid of you, and I didn't want you to, to, uh...  Break my word. <br/>Break your word to him. <br/>I couldn't have. I would have written Dave down anyway. <br/>So everything's still cool. I don't want you to worry. Nothing's going crazy or nothing. <br/>All right. <br/>My damage control with Shambo definitely worked. I just lied to her, which is exactly what I've been doing this whole time. I've lied about almost every aspect of my life. I'm the richest man here, but I lied about what I do for a living because  I'll do whatever living because I'll do whatever it takes to win this game. it takes to win this game. <br/>All right, good night. <br/>All right, good night. This is too easy. This is too easy. This is too easy. âª âª  Oh, no. We're just kind of shooting the breeze, letting...  Oh. The game's not over yet, you know. <br/>Oh, no, no, not at all. <br/>Of all the people still here, who would you guys vote for, I mean, if you  were on the jury? <br/>Russell and Mick could get a lot of votes. <br/>Yeah, I think they could. I think they will. <br/>I think Russell is the biggest threat by far. <br/>Yeah. <br/>'Cause people are gonna be like, "That guy played an insane game."  Right. <br/>It's always interesting to me because behind the scenes, it really has been  me and Russell making decisions, but...  Right, right. <br/>I kind of left him out there to be the aggressive bulldog while I kind of  stayed behind the scenes, trying to be nice. <br/>Oh, no, that could ruin you. <br/>Apparently, that was a... No, honestly, and I'm beginning to think that was  the wrong strategy. This is an interesting phase in the game because you really have to start  thinking about winning over the jury, and the way that I'm gonna try to play  the jury is that the decisions that we made were group decisions. I had a big part in those decisions. It wasn't just Russell unilaterally doing this. Plus, you know, he was an abrasive guy. I was the more calm, cool, bond[1]with-you  kind of guy, so I feel like I'm the guy that should get that million dollars. <br/>I mean, if I was in your  I mean, if I was in your situation... situation...  The interesting thing about day 36 is that at that point, there's no hidden  immunity idols anymore. There's no nothing, so it's-- everyone gets an equal vote, and...  Just make it to day 36. <br/>Just make it to day 36. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Today I found out that Russell already has a lot of money, and I'm starting  to see some of the cracks in their armor, and I think this will be the time  that tests their loyalty to each other, especially as they all have different  opinions of who they see in the final three, so it's just a matter of time  before that bomb ticks and then blows that bomb ticks and then blows up. up. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Cool. <br/>Probst: All right, today, no reward challenge. Today we're playing for immunity. <br/>Everybody was expecting the reward challenge. I'm happier than the reward 'cause I'm ready to start eliminating some people  out here. I want to go to Tribal time and time again. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to it? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: First things first, Jaison, I will take back the Jaison, I will take  back the immunity necklace. immunity necklace. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will take part in a Survivorbowling tournament. Here's how it works-- you will be randomly matched up against another person. Your goal, very simple: roll the ball down the lane, knock over as many pins  as you can. You get two shots. Winner moves on to the next round. Loser is out. Last person left standing wins immunity, guaranteed a one in seven shot at a  million bucks. Guys ready to get to it? <br/>Yes. <br/>Make it happen. <br/>Probst: We'll draw for  Probst: We'll draw for matchups and we'll get started. matchups and we'll get started. All right, Natalie and Shambo. First matchup. Choose a ball and roll. Purple always goes first. That's you, Natalie. <br/>Oh, dear. <br/>Probst: Got to get the jitters out. Natalie throws a gutter ball on her first roll, opening the door for Shambo. <br/>This is for all my friends that play in a bowling league. <br/>Probst: Look at that. <br/>Oh, Sham. <br/>Probst: Wow. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: Shambo with a nice first ball of nine. <br/>That was good. [Dave whistles]  Wow. <br/>Probst: Natalie, you have to knock down at least nine pins or you're out of  this tournament just like that. <br/>Yeah, looks good. <br/>Probst: That's a good roll. <br/>Wow, oh, wow. <br/>Probst: But not enough. Natalie is out. Shambo moves on to the next round. Next matchup-- Brett taking on Russell. Brett, gutter ball. <br/>A little off. That's all right. <br/>Nicely done, Russell. <br/>Probst: Russell right down the middle. <br/>Oh, good job, Russ. <br/>Probst: Russell knocked down four pins. Brett, got to knock down at least four or you are out. That's not going to do it. Brett is out of this challenge. Russell moves on. <br/>Good job, Russ. <br/>Probst: Next round-- Jaison  Probst: Next round-- Jaison taking on Monica. taking on Monica. [Jaison groans]  Probst: Jaison with two. Nope. Gutter ball for Monica. <br/>Uh-oh, uh-oh. <br/>Probst: Total down-- six pins. Got your work cut out for you, Monica. That's down the middle. You need six or more to stay alive. One won't do it. Monica is out. <br/>Probst: Jaison moves on to the next round. Last round-- Mick taking on Dave. <br/>Let's go, Mick. <br/>Probst: Mick with a nice first roll. Mick knocks down four pins. Mick knocks down four pins. Dave Ball is up. Dave Ball is up. That's a nice shot right there. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: That's a strike! First strike of the Survivor First strike of the Survivor tournament goes to  Dave Ball. tournament goes to Dave Ball. Mick, knock down every pin to force a tiebreaker. You can do it. Nope. Falls short. Mick is out. Dave Ball moves on to the next round. Moving on to round two. Draw for new matchups. Shambo taking on Russ. Jaison taking on Dave. The winner of this matchup moves on to the final round and will have a shot  at immunity. <br/>Let's go, Sham. <br/>Probst: Nice roll by Shambo. Shambo knocks down five pins with her first roll. <br/>Uh-oh. <br/>Probst: Russell knocks down four pins. <br/>Good job, Russ. <br/>Oh, way off. <br/>Probst: Nothing for Shambo. Russell, two gets you a win and moves you on to the final round. <br/>Go, Russ. <br/>Oh. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>Probst: Russell doesn't pick up any pins. Russell is out. Shambo is moving on to the final round and a shot at immunity. <br/>Good job, Sham. <br/>Nice job, Sham. <br/>Probst: Next two-- Jaison  Probst: Next two-- Jaison taking on Dave. taking on Dave. <br/>No. <br/>No. <br/>Probst: Nothing for Jaison. <br/>Probst: Nothing for Jaison. <br/>Probst: Nothing for Jaison. Gutter ball for Dave Ball. Gutter ball for Dave Ball. Jaison rolls his second ball and it's a nice one. <br/>Good job, Jaison. <br/>Probst: Jaison knocks over seven pins. <br/>Good job, Jaison. <br/>Probst: Dave needs seven pins to stay in this, eight to win to stay in this,  eight to win it. it. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Probst: That's not going to do it. Dave Ball is out. Jaison moves on to the final round against Shambo. All right, it is Shambo taking on Jaison. Winner wins immunity. Shambo with her first roll. She gets nothing. <br/>Go, Jaison, right down the middle. <br/>Probst: Jaison with his first roll. <br/>Oh. <br/>Probst: Jaison gets nothing. Pressure mounting. Each player has one roll left. <br/>Let's go, Sham. <br/>Let's go, Sham. <br/>Baby, right here, right now. <br/>Baby, right here, right now. Come on. <br/>Probst: Shambo once again comes up empty-handed. <br/>Unbelievable. <br/>Probst: Jaison, all you have to do is knock down one pin. One pin...  That's all. <br/>Probst: ...and you have immunity again. <br/>Don't overthink it, man, don't think. <br/>Probst: That's all you got  Probst: That's all you got to do. to do. <br/>Go! <br/>Probst: Is it gonna hang on? [others shout] That will do it. Jaison wins individual immunity for the second time in a row! <br/>Good job, Jaison! <br/>Good job, Jai! <br/>Good job, man! <br/>Probst: Jaison, come on over. Nice job. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Once again, Jaison is safe at tonight's Tribal Council. After 31 days, one of you going home. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I'll see you at Tribal. Congrats. <br/>Thanks. <br/>When Dave did not win that challenge, I was, like... [whispers]:  "Buh-bye." [whispers]: "Buh-bye." Dave's going home  tonight. Dave's going home tonight. Dave's going home tonight. âª âª  I'm gonna walk down the beach, I think. For me, the tide has turned. I am low man on the pole. All I know is somebody's going home, and it ain't gonna be home, and it ain't  gonna be Jaison. Jaison. <br/>Hey. <br/>Hey. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>All right. I think the case for getting rid of Dave primarily is because that's who  Shambo wants gone right now. And let's just keep the waters calm, you know? We stirred up enough by getting rid of John-- we don't want to... anger her,  or get her to... anger her, or get her upset. upset. <br/>Well, what names are in your head right now? <br/>Right now, Dave's going home. <br/>You think so? <br/>I know so. <br/>And that's just decided? <br/>That's just it. <br/>I just don't think that Dave is this big threat that people think he is, I  really don't. Right now I'm trying to stay a little bit more passive and really get into  people's heads. Russell is no fool. He's not about to take someone like Shambo that far who could potentially get  a lot of jury votes. I think we're underestimating Shambo, though. Shambo is a hard worker around camp. <br/>I know she is. <br/>And let's face it, a majority of the jury is Galu. They look at Shambo as a strong woman who really competed in challenges and  kept things going around camp, who's always in the running for immunity. <br/>Yeah, I see your point. <br/>I just started to plant the seed and make arguments that would make Russell  sweat. I mean, with me on Dave's side and whispering Shambo's name in Russell's ear,  anything can happen. I think you should still keep options open. <br/>Yeah. I'm hearing you, that's for sure. I have a lot of options in the game right now. I can play different ways and still be okay. One option I have is keeping Dave, because I know I can beat Dave for the  million dollars. Just think, me, Dave, for a million dollars? It's a no-brainer. I have to win. So it's a good strategic move to keep Dave around. I'm gonna tell you, Dave. <br/>All right, what's up, buddy? <br/>Your best strategic move...  Uh-huh. <br/>...would be talking to me. <br/>Mm. <br/>I don't know why you ain't came to me yet. <br/>All right, well, it sounds like you got some thoughts in your mind. <br/>Yes, I do. <br/>I'd be interested in hearing them. <br/>Right now, everybody is debating you and Shambo. <br/>Okay. <br/>So if I decide Shambo, I could get Natalie. <br/>I could get Brett and Monica on that, no problem. <br/>So that's five right there. <br/>That's all we need. Russell comes to me and says, "If you, Brett, and Monica vote Shambo,  Shambo goes home." But I have no idea whether that's actually gonna  happen. <br/>You think it's a pretty good move? <br/>Yeah. Anything that keeps me here another day sounds pretty good. Last night, I was pretty sure I was coming back, but I wasn't positive. Tonight... I don't know. However, miracles happen constantly. If one happened tonight, I would not be surprised, because the lord freaking  provides. So Shambo tonight, huh? <br/>That's how I'm seeing it. <br/>Honestly, I've got no problem with that at all. <br/>Shambo's dead set on getting rid of Dave, but, truthfully, I don't even need  Shambo. I could let Shambo throw away her vote, just like she did against John, and I  can get rid against John, and I can get rid of Shambo. of Shambo. Yup, yup. That's what Russ said. <br/>Sure. <br/>Sure. He just asked. <br/>Sure. He just asked. <br/>Yeah, let's do it. <br/>Yeah, let's do it. <br/>David, they're not starting to gun for me. They've been gunning for me since day one. It's 'cause I'm the Sham with the plan. It's hard to compete with me. I'll be happy watching Dave get his torch snuffed, because that guy drives me  absolutely bananas. I believe what Russ says...  This is what's going on. <br/>...but if Dave is not voted off tonight, I think Russ and I are gonna be  having a chat. are gonna be having a chat. âª âª  Probst: We'll now bring in  Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. the members of our jury. Erik, Kelly, Laura and John, voted out at the last Tribal voted out at the  last Tribal Council. Council. Jaison, day 31, eight people left, the reason you vote somebody out tonight  probably very different from why you voted somebody out on day two. <br/>Yeah. Now I think it's more strategic in terms of trying to get rid of some of the  stronger players because they're smart and are good at strategy or because  they're physically able to win immunity. If there's a third reason, it would be because of the jury, you know? You want to have the best shot you can, if you get to that final two or  three, whatever it ends up being, of getting votes. So as far as I'm concerned, that's probably the three criteria. <br/>Probst: Shambo, at the last Tribal Council, you brought up a different reason  which is, you want to vote people out of this game that don't deserve to go  to the end. Still feel that way? <br/>Oh, yeah, I absolutely feel that way. But by the same token, I wouldn't have voted John out, not in a million  years, because he's somebody that I was aligned with, and I think I was more  blindsided than John was, truthfully. <br/>Probst: Great working of the jury, too. Well done. <br/>No, this is serious. <br/>Probst: Monica, what about somebody who's just unpredictable and you're  getting so late in the game, you just don't know if you can count on them or  not? <br/>I definitely think that unpredictability is scary at this point in the game. We're getting low in numbers, and you want to have someone that you know you  can discuss the vote with and realize who do I want to see go to the end at  this point? <br/>Probst: So, Dave, what do you have to do at this point to stay in this game? <br/>I think you've got to get people on your side and say, "I think you have  a better shot at a million dollars with me than you have with this person  over here who you're currently aligned with. <br/>Probst: Russell, Dave laid out a very clear and potentially effective  strategy: "You are better with me, let's go to the end."  I appreciate that. It's a good strategy. The fact of the matter is, if you know some people are going to get all the  votes, then you want to get rid of them. That's probably the most important move of the game to me, even more than a  physical threat. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. Jaison, for the second Tribal Council in a row, you have the immunity  necklace. You can choose to assign it to somebody else. <br/>No, I'm keeping it. <br/>Probst: You cannot vote for Jaison. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Mick, you're up. Mick, you're up. Mick, you're up. <br/>See you later, Dave. <br/>See you later, Dave. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. <br/>Probst: If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now  would be want to play it, now would be the time to do so. the time to do so. All right. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote... Shambo. Dave. One vote Shambo, one vote Dave. Dave. Two votes Dave, one vote Shambo. Dave. That's three votes Dave, one vote Shambo. Dave. Four votes Dave, one vote Shambo. 11th person voted out, and the fifth member of our jury... Dave. That's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. âª âª Dave, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Good game, you guys. <br/>Good game, you guys. <br/>See you, Davey. <br/>See you, Davey. <br/>Probst: Well, for the first time in this game, the members who made up the  original Foa Foa have the numbers advantage. No matter how bad it seems, never count yourself out of this game. Grab your torches, head back to camp. camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>I wanted a chance to play the game. I played my hardest. I went full on. Russell just played a better game. I think we all underestimated Russell. Man, he's just born to play this game. I'm bummed that it's over. Now here I am. <br/>Probst: After the break, more grudges...  The little bitch needs to be sent home tonight. <br/>Probst: ...more fights. <br/>Why would you do something stupid like that? <br/>I did not. I didn't do that. <br/>Probst: ...and more betrayals. <br/>Russell is Russell, so we got to watch out. <br/>That worries me that he's going to send me home, 'cause going to send me  home, 'cause that's what I would do. that's what I would do. <br/>It's a no-brainer. Well, Brett is just, uh, way too likable. He's a nice guy. He would almost get 100% of the vote, so Brett is a huge threat in this game. That's why I got to get rid of That's why I got to get rid of him next. him next. <br/>'Cause I remember, you know, last night, you're, like, uh, "Somebody's...  feels like the jury's going to like them more, you got to get rid of them. Somebody's a threat, you got to get rid of them."  I was completely talking about Brett the whole time in my mind. <br/>Okay. <br/>It doesn't make any sense for me not to get rid of Brett. <br/>Day one, I was voted the leader of, uh, Foa Foa, but I think it's developed  now to where Russell is definitely, you know, the leader of us strategically,  for sure. I got to be thinking, he's a game player. He plays hard. Maybe he's thinking of taking other people to the jury, um, with him so that  he has a better shot. I'm not going to be caught off guard. That's the only thing. <br/>Right. &gt; And I mean, I got to wonder...  It makes me nervous thinking you're nervous, to tell you the truth. Mick is freaking out, and when you freak out that much, you'll flip. That worries me that he's going to send me home, 'cause that's to send me  home, 'cause that's what I would do. what I would do. what I would do. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready for another immunity challenge? <br/>Let's make it happen. <br/>Probst: First things first, Jaison. You know I'm taking it. You know I'm taking it. <br/>Yup. <br/>Yup. <br/>Probst: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you must race out into the water, retrieve one of your  three bags and race back. You must then use a plank to launch your bag into your basket. First person to get all three bags in their basket wins immunity, is safe  tonight at Tribal Council and guaranteed a one in six shot at a million  dollars. You guys ready to get to it? <br/>Yup. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Probst: All right, we'll draw for spots, and we'll get started. Here we go. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! Retrieving one bag at a time, then racing back. Jaison untying those knots. Jaison has his first bag. Mick has his first bag. Brett right behind. Russell's heading back. Monica has a bag. Shambo, Natalie bringing up the rear. You got to hop on that plank to You got to hop on that plank to get your bag  in the basket. get your bag in the basket. 33 days. Clearly evident. Natalie really struggling. Struggling just to keep her clothes on. Lost a lot of weight out here. Keep digging. Let's go. You've been out here 33 days. Don't stop now. Brett gets his first bag in the basket. Brett heading back out on the course. Mick has his first bag in the basket. Mick heading back out. Mick gaining some ground on Brett now. Russell has his first bag in the basket. Russell now out on the course. Shambo gets her first bag in the basket. Brett, Mick, Russell, all with their second bags. Jaison, Monica, Natalie-- still no luck with their first bags. Brett back with his second bag. Mick right on his heels. Brett connects. He's heading out for his third and final bag. Mick right behind. It is Brett and Mick heading out for their final bags. Russell back with his second bag. <br/>In! <br/>Probst: Jaison has his first bag in the basket. Russell has his second bag in the basket. Natalie's now out. Monica the only one left who has not got a bag in her basket. It is coming down to Brett and Mick, both coming back with their final bags. Brett kicking it into high gear now. He's sprinting back. Mick, you better dig. Brett back with his final bag. Brett can win it. Mick for the win. You don't want to go home tonight. Mick, just short. Mick, just short. Brett wins individual immunity! Brett wins individual immunity! Brett, come on over. <br/>Good job, Brett. <br/>Good job, B. <br/>Probst: After 33 days, Brett does not have to worry about going home tonight. Mick, Russell, Natalie, Shambo, Monica, Jaison, one of the six of you will go  home. I'll see you at Tribal tonight. <br/>Brett has shown that he's got new life, and if he wins enough immunity  challenges, he could put a wrench in our entire game plan. Now we got to get Monica, which is fine, but this could be a is fine, but  this could be a problem. problem. <br/>Thank you, my friend. <br/>Baby boy, busts out a move! <br/>Brett! Brett! <br/>Well, finally got my time. <br/>Brett, good job. <br/>You didn't want to go home today, did you? <br/>I was so pissed. I just couldn't get the freaking I just couldn't get the freaking thing in  the basket. thing in the basket. <br/>I know. <br/>We don't even got to say a name. We know what's up-- Monica. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's done. <br/>Today, Brett won immunity, and it totally sucks for me. At this point, it puts me in a bad situation where I seem like the next  viable option to go home, but I'm going to do everything in my power to make  everything in my power to make sure that that doesn't happen. sure that that doesn't happen. <br/>Just wondering how comfortable you feel making it to the final three, 'cause  I was thinking, if I was in your shoes, I would get worried a little bit. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>You know, you are a very likable person, and that, you know, obviously, can  be a threat, you know...  Yeah. <br/>...when it comes down to the  ...when it comes down to the jury. jury. <br/>Right. <br/>See, I don't know if you've even thought about that. <br/>Are you kidding me? I've thought about it a ton. It's like, a little kid sees a snake, and the snake's, like, "Hey, come  play with me. I'm not going to bite you." And the kid starts playing with the snake,  and the snake bites him, and he's, like, "What happened? You said you weren't going to bite me." He's, like, "I'm a snake. That's what I do."  Hmm. <br/>So, I am very skeptical. There is definitely a part of me that wants to make a big move and definitely  thought about the possibility of getting rid of Russell. There are emotional and moral attachments to people, but I mean, every night  I sit there, and I visualize in my head my name with one million dollars  written in front of it. So, I mean, it's tough. <br/>If you want to, you know, make a big move and, you know, blindside someone  that might want to take you out, you have want to take you out, you have the  opportunity to do so. the opportunity to do so. <br/>He's a player, man. I mean, it would make more sense for him to take, like, Natalie for him to  take, like, Natalie and Shambo. and Shambo. <br/>I just don't want to be off guard and not worry about guard and not worry  about things, you know. things, you know. <br/>I'm just telling you. I mean, you need to... [Russell mumbles]  ...put people on your jury that are going to vote for you. <br/>My position is the best in this game right now. <br/>Yeah. <br/>So why would I jeopardize that...? <br/>Well, I think you are jeopardizing your game by taking people like Jaison  who's just counting down the days to day 36, when it's your final day to play  the idol. <br/>How do you think that? <br/>He told me so, but I'm telling you right now that I telling you right now  that I did not sit in that... did not sit in that...  He told me it on the beach. He said, "Well, he can only play that idol until day 36." So, I  mean, these are the people you have in your court. I'm surprised you want to put meon the jury. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I can make or break you on  I can make or break you on the jury, really. the jury, really. the jury, really. <br/>Because, uh...  Because, uh...  You told her I made a lot of money? Why would you do something stupid like that? <br/>I did not... I didn't do that. <br/>Who told her? <br/>Someone else told her. <br/>Someone else told her. I never told her what you did. I never told her what you did. <br/>How do I know? <br/>Yeah. How come all of a sudden Monica thinks I make a lot of money for some reason? some reason? <br/>Uh, Jaison? <br/>Uh, Jaison? <br/>She told me what I do for a living. I want to know what happened. You know, did you tell her that you would get rid of me after I get rid of  the idol? <br/>No. <br/>Why would she tell me that? <br/>Because she's trying to stay in the game. Russell was so angry. I might have made a mistake and told her what he does for a living. I honestly don't remember, but now I'm nervous that Russell is going to come  after me, so we've got to nip this in the bud soon. We got to start thinking about, you know, Russell is Russell, so we got to,  we got to watch out we got to, we got to watch out because... because...  Oh, my word. <br/>The three of us-- myself, Mick, and Natalie-- we got to Mick, and Natalie--  we got to make a tough decision tonight. make a tough decision tonight. <br/>It just makes me mad and I like it. <br/>You like being pissed off? <br/>Hell, yes. Making me mad fuels my fire. Monica, she had to run her little piehole. The little bitch needs to be sent home tonight, but now I've got to worry  about Jaison, so at Tribal Council, if I'm feeling any kind of heat, I have  the immunity idol. I'm gonna walk in there and if I feel any kind of threat whatsoever, I'll  stand up and whatsoever, I'll stand up and play it. play it. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in  Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. the members of our jury. Erik, Kelly, Laura, John, and Dave, voted out at the last Dave, voted out at  the last Tribal Council. Tribal Council. What's going on, Russell? <br/>I just found a little pretty necklace. Thought I'd wear it, make me look a little better out here. <br/>Probst: Shambo, is that a surprise to you? <br/>Everything he does is a surprise. <br/>Probst: Anybody else shocked by Russell putting on what appears to be the  hidden immunity idol? <br/>Absolutely not. I think Russell's getting a little cocky up in here. <br/>You see, some people think that this right here puts a target on my back. I beg to differ about that. I think it puts a target on somebody else's back. <br/>He's humble. [Monica laughs]  Probst: He does have safety around his neck if he chooses to use it. <br/>Nobody really knows what you're gonna do with it. That's what makes it so powerful. <br/>Probst: Brett, things have really changed, haven't they? <br/>Yeah, I would say that, you know, by his gestures, he feels pretty  comfortable, and as of right now, they do have the numbers, but when you get  comfortable in this game, things can come and haunt you, so you got to stay  humble in this game. <br/>Probst: Shambo, what was it like at camp after the challenge? <br/>It was probably the worst day that we have had prior to a Tribal. <br/>Probst: Wow. <br/>Russell got his feathers ruffled, and it was just... It was...  Awesome. <br/>It was not pretty. It was ugly. <br/>Probst: Russell? <br/>Monica tells me, "If you vote me out, I ain't putting your name down for  the million dollars, and I'm gonna talk to everybody else; they ain't putting  your name down." Well, you know what? You're only making me vote you out now because of what you said. <br/>You know, Russell came into the merge and basically tried to push a lot of  buttons, and I haven't seen Russell's buttons pushed, but today he was  huffing and puffing all over camp. "Did you say this about me?" I mean, he was fuming, fuming. <br/>Probst: And what about that delights you so much? <br/>Basically, I couldn't help but have a sense of pride, knowing that if I put a  scintilla of doubt in their minds of trust, then I accomplished my mission. <br/>Probst: Russell, a little bit of teacher-student. You taught her so well, she graduated and said, "How about this?"  Seeing what I've seen today, if I would have been on her tribe in the  beginning, we would have been dangerous for sure. You know, she got me pissed off, so if she would have played that hard this  entire game, she would be the one in charge right now. <br/>Or I could be going home earlier. <br/>But I've been playing hard this entire game and I am still here. <br/>Because of idols. <br/>Yeah, well, that's playing hard. <br/>Probst: Russell, a little concerned that Monica could have stirred up  something that points fingers now at you? <br/>Not at all. I know that everything is fine, and that might be my mistake in the game, but  I don't think so. <br/>Probst: Mick, when Monica's over there stirring it up, you have to be going,  "This is not good."  Yeah, of course, absolutely, and we're not that shortsighted to say we're all  four going to win a million bucks, so your wheels start spinning a little bit. I mean, all of a sudden, I'm here in front of the jury with so-and-so versus  so-and-so. You got to think about stuff like that. If you're not, then you're stupid. <br/>Probst: Well, it sounds like it was an interesting afternoon, and the big  question seems to be: did Monica's scrambling pay off? Brett, you have the immunity necklace. I know you're not giving that up. <br/>I think I'm gonna hold on to it. <br/>Probst: You cannot vote for Brett. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. It's time to vote. Brett, you're up. Brett, you're up. <br/>Stupid, stupid little girl. <br/>Stupid, stupid little girl. Bad strategy. Bad strategy. <br/>Watch out 'cause you have a  Watch out 'cause you have a huge target on your back. huge target on your back. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time play it, now would be the time to do so. to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote. Monica. Russell. One vote-- Monica, one vote-- One vote-- Monica, one vote-- Russell. Russell. Monica. Two votes-- Monica, one vote-- Russell. Russell. We're tied. Two votes-- Monica, two votes-- Two votes-- Monica, two votes-- Russell. Russell. Monica. That's three votes-- Monica, two That's three votes-- Monica, two votes--  Russell. votes-- Russell. 12th person voted out and the sixth member of our jury-- Monica. That's four, that's enough. That's four, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Monica, the tribe has spoken. Monica, the tribe has spoken. Well, there are six of you left in this game now. Not everybody's going to make it to the final, so while it may not have  worked for Monica tonight, going to be a lot more scrambling to come. Grab your torches, head back to camp. camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor. <br/>I'm in! <br/>Maybe something is going on with Mick, Natalie, and Brett. I have to blindside everybody. <br/>Probst: With only two episodes left, the alliances are shifting. <br/>This is the team. Me, Jaison-- we are running the show. <br/>There's a chance that Russell's lying to me and it Russell's lying to me and  it scares the hell out of me. scares the hell out of me. <br/>I am shocked. I mean, 33 days, and I feel amazing. I think I made it really far in this game, and I definitely went out causing  some conflict in the Foa Foas. I think they all distrust each other a little bit more, and I'm proud to say  that I caused that and that I stirred the pot a little bit, even if it was on  my little bit, even if it was on my way out.
