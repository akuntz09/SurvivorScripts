<br/>I'm J.T., and I'm from Samson, Alabama. People's impression of me may be that I'm a hillbilly, but I'm here to win  and I'm gonna win. <br/>Probst: J.T.! Unbelievable! <br/>J.T.! <br/>Probst: J.T. has lost a tooth. J.T.! J.T.! J.T. wins final immunity! <br/>The challenge for me is gonna be fitting in with the people. <br/>Probst: Who would you trust with your life? <br/>Everybody says J.T. <br/>You just can't find anything wrong with him. <br/>What a great soul. <br/>I know I can trust you. <br/>You have my word. To the final two in this game. My mom told me, "You can win this game. If anybody can do it, you can do it." it." [cheering and applause]  [cheering and applause]  Probst: Welcome to the Survivor: Tocantinslive reunion show. We have all 16 survivors, including our winner. J.T., are you crying? <br/>Yes. [laughter]  Probst: Wow! [J.T. exhales] Who would have expected you to shed a tear? What's going on? What's the feeling right now? <br/>I'm very happy, obviously. <br/>Probst: Yeah? <br/>I just created one of the best friends I'll probably ever have: Stephen and  his family. And you know, my parents are crying, so I can't help it. I'm happy. This is probably the happiest I have ever been in my life, obviously. <br/>Probst: Well, I've got to say-- and this is with all respect to everybody  else here-- you're one of the most popular guys we've had on the show. Everywhere-- including this whole week when I've been in New York City--  people have been coming up, going, "Hate Coach and love J.T." Oh,  Coach, we'll get to you. You'll get your chance. You know what I mean, "hate." They loved to hate Richard Hatch, too. <br/>Oh, yeah, I know. <br/>Probst: You know, you're in good company. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>Probst: But honestly, one of the most popular guys. What's the reaction been at home for you? Are people adoring you the same way? <br/>Yeah, people in Samson are very hysterical. They love me. [laughter] I mean, behind me all the way, and I love them, too, but they are  really behind me. They've been very supportive, and I mean, I know they're surprised right now  because I didn't tell a soul about anything. My parents didn't even know I was... they thought I was fourth, at best. <br/>Probst: Really? <br/>So this is very shocking to everybody, and everyone's been behind me, very  supportive. <br/>Probst: What was the... out there... I mean, we talked... I said about how  tough this game was. What was the toughest point? You're a guy that, you know, we got to know through the show, makes his  living outdoors. This is-- was this easy for you? Was there a time for you when it was tough as well? <br/>This was very hard. One of the questions I get the most is that: is it as hard as it looks? Obviously you don't know unless you go, but, like, day 12, you know, I was  really questioning what am I doing here. Day 11, day 12, I was the hungriest I have ever been in my life. You couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I really-- what am I doing here? I said that numerous times, but I had to tough it out. So it's way tougher than it looks. <br/>Probst: What was it about Stephen, a very unlikely choice when you look at  some of the other people up here that you might have been drawn to, based on  just first impressions? Why him? <br/>Stephen was the one person I thought I would not align myself with. I'll be honest with you. He was the one guy that I doubted the most, and immediately after the hike, I  mean, he carried a sack with three melons in it, and it shows me carrying one. He carried more than his load, and he impressed me-- you know, obviously, he  impressed everybody, but, you know, day three or four, Stephen was right by  my side working harder than anybody, doing things he had never done before,  and he has the best heart of anybody I know. <br/>Probst: Aw, nice. [applause]  Stephen! <br/>Probst: So the... [applause continues] Stephen, what was the key to this  alliance working? Lots of people make alliances that don't work. <br/>I definitely think... wow, I mean, it's like I said in the show. We, we... something about our intellects clicked. We were always working hard. You know, we would come back from challenges, and we would... or from  rewards, and we would say, "Let's get to work." And for us, it was  always about "This is a game that we're both here to win and we're going  to both play our hardest, never let our guard down, and work together  constantly to make sure that we are there at the end."  Probst: And you also mentioned to me just earlier that you had an inside that  I didn't know anything about. You kind of had an inside mole in this game. <br/>Well, one of the things that definitely helped us get as far as we did within  the merge tribe was Coach's relationship with J.T. Coach had this sort of image of J.T. as this kind of warrior spirit, and he would tell J.T. everything. So Tyson would tell his plans to Coach; Coach would tell J.T.; J.T. would tell me; and our insurgency would be victorious. [laughter]  Probst: Coach, you're instrumental. Y-You're everywhere. <br/>I'm the gift that keeps on giving. <br/>He owes me a million dollars. [laughter]  Sorry, man. <br/>Probst: The betrayal... I mean, let me... just to remind you, Stephen, what  J.T. said. J.T. said to you, "You have my word and my life, and I have yours,  right?" And then we get to that final Tribal, and you get asked the  question, and you say, "No, I wouldn't have taken him." What did  that feel like in that moment to have to let this guy know you would not have  lived up to your statements? <br/>I mean, it was something I wrestled with a lot, and, you know, Debbie said,  "I value honesty," and she seemed to be really seeking a specific  answer from me. Of course, then, you know, she asked J.T. his question, which was, "J.T., isn't it true that you're the greatest  person that's ever existed?" [laughter] And he was, "Yes, yes,  Debbie, I am." But, you know, obviously it felt horrible to come clean,  you know, with that. <br/>Probst: But it didn't damage your friendship, J.T. When you heard it, you did this whole, "Oh, I can't..." Were you  just putting on? <br/>Yes, I was, Jeff. I'll be honest. [laughter] I'll be honest. I was definitely trying to pull some votes out because it's very, it's very  different for me to take Stephen to the final two and for Stephen to take me  because I knew, you know, people liked me, and, you know, obviously I had  never had anyone write my name down, so it was hard for someone to take me  on, you know. <br/>Probst: Brendan, what happened with Timbira? You got... at the merge, in a game about numbers, you had, you had it made. Did you have too many people? <br/>I think we had too many people, and I think we had a good amount of  dysfunction in our tribe between this guy and this guy and myself. <br/>Probst: A little bit of a power struggle. <br/>A little bit of a power struggle, and I think that was pretty clear when they  came in and the fact that we did have six instead of four. You know, we had an extra person, and I think Erinn switched over pretty  easily, so we kind of set ourselves up for it. <br/>Probst: Well, and Erinn, I have to give you credit because I always say to  win this game, sooner or later you typically have to make a big move, betray  somebody. You... is that what prompted you to jump? <br/>Absolutely. You can... you have to look at it as: what is the best situation for me? How can I further myself in this game? I want to be here as long as possible. Every day I can spend out here, I can get that much closer to making another  move, to staying longer, and if I can be six or if I can be four, clearly I'm  going to be four. <br/>Probst: Meaning you're on Timbira, you're at the bottom. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Probst: If you jump over to Jalapao, you move up two spots. <br/>Right, I'm still at the bottom, but I'm higher than I was. That's six more days. <br/>Probst: And it... look where it got you. It got you a shot at getting in... into the final. Taj, did anyone ever talk about taking out J.T. earlier? I mean, everybody talks about how, "We love J.T. J.T. is so great." This is a game that, in the end, is kind of about  popularity, who do you like the best. <br/>It is, and no one ever discussed that because going into the merge, we...  well, I assumed it was us three till the end and we'd work on that toward the  end. And I would always tell them I never wanted to be the last one with the idol  because I don't want to tell one of them they had to go home. It would have been so hard for me because we had been so close for the whole  entire game. It was just something that I didn't want to do. But of course not, J.T. just never came up because he was so sweet. <br/>Probst: Now, J.T., I have something here. Back, early... early on...  Gross! <br/>Probst: ...you-you knocked... one of your teeth got knocked out, or a part of  your tooth. I... we went and found it. Brendan, I think, found it. Somebody... who found it? <br/>I found it. <br/>Probst: Brendan found it. I picked it up, gave it to you. I hear back from medical, "J.T. doesn't want his tooth." I said, "I want his tooth. Give me his tooth. I'll take his damn tooth." So, I just... I've kept it this entire time. Hold on, hold on. No one panic. It's right here. Okay, Michael, let's... let's get a shot of that so you can just see his  tooth. Can you see it? Okay. Now, I just want to make... I want to ask you again before... Do you want  your tooth back? <br/>It's still completely useless to me. My mom probably wants it. I'm sure my little sister...  Probst: Well, we-we got a lot of women, all front-row women, going, "I  want his... I want all of him. " All right, Mom, you want the tooth? Let's go say hi to Mom down here. Hold on. Hold on. [applause] [applause] What's your name, Mom? <br/>Marie. Marie. <br/>How-how proud of you, first of all, of J.T. out there... of J.T.? <br/>Oh, very proud. <br/>Probst: Yeah? You... he-he kind of said in one of his interviews, "My mom said, 'You  can win this game.'"  Yes. <br/>Probst: So you believed that the whole way. <br/>I told him for about three years I thought he could do this. <br/>Probst: Really? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Yeah, how does it feel right now? Your son's got a lot of money. [laughter]  Uh, it's good. I might not have to worry about him anymore. <br/>Probst: Yeah, well, all right, hold your hand out. I don't want you to drop this. That is your son, your little baby who you gave birth to, and it grew into  this tooth that he doesn't want. Close it up. Very nice to meet you, and congratulations. [applause] All right. Up next: some were nice; some were nasty. We'll hear from Taj and Tyson. And still to come, Coach: liar or truth teller? Plus, one Survivor will be vote... will be voted our Sprint player of the  year and get to go home with an extra $100,000. home with an extra $100,000. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. As the rain comes down to welcome us. [thunder rumbling]  Oh, my gosh! <br/>It doesn't look like it's  It doesn't look like it's letting up. letting up. <br/>Being out here for so long, you almost forget what home is like and what the  people are like that you love. <br/>See you back at the camp. <br/>[sobbing]: Oh, my gosh! <br/>Probst: Did you hear that last line? <br/>"See you back at the camp!"  "See you back at the camp!" Oh, my God! Oh, my God! He's my fire. He is the love of my life, so it was just like the skies just parted, the sun  came out, and nothing else hurt after that. nothing else hurt after that. [applause] [applause]  Probst: Welcome back to the Survivor: Tocantinslive reunion show. Taj, first of all, I have to say, of-of all the seasons, you were one of the  biggest surprises because when we were out there, I would have never guessed  people were going to love you like they love you. I was wrong. I was completely wrong. [applause] And-and I... so I want to ask you... we got... I don't know how  many of you guys know, uh, Taj's past. Throw that shot up, Michael. You were a pop star in your own right, right there in the middle. <br/>I'm on the end. <br/>Probst: On the end? <br/>I'm on the end with the ugly glasses. <br/>Probst: Well, whichever one you are, you were the thing... Oh, oh, I see. Well, there's two sets of ugly glasses up there. But... so, what I'm getting at is this... you... that was kind of a glam...  that's a glamorous life. When you're doing that, people are taking care of you. Survivor--there ain't nothing. How much of a culture shock was this for you? <br/>I'm not a-an outdoorsy girl. I grew up in Brooklyn, New York, so the biggest part was just adjusting to  that outdoors life. I've never been fishing before. I've never had to strike a fire before. I'm used to a gas stove, so to go out there and have to drink from this  river, make my own shelter, food, everything, it... it was a huge shock, but  I got used to it real quick, and once I caught on, I was... I was, like,  building fires for J.T. I was fishing for the camp. It was cool. <br/>Probst: Show me... hold one of your arms out 'cause you got... you got some  wear and tear on those arms. <br/>I got wear and tear everywhere. <br/>Probst: Hold them steady there for a second. Michael, try and get... can you... I don't know if we can see that, but you  got a lot of bite scars and... I mean, you were getting eaten up out there. <br/>This is just the tip of the iceberg. They bit up my entire back, my legs, everything. And I'm... to be a little vain, my skin was, like, my biggest asset, and to  go out there and get chewed up the way I did, I was just crushed. I'm sitting in the water, like, "It's time to go home." [laughter]  Probst: Relive for me the moment when you realized when you were looking at  that message from your husband, Eddie, that he said, "I will see you  back at camp." 'Cause you... I still got a little bruise from the way  you grabbed me. <br/>I was so hysterical that day. You know, of course, looking at that video, when I saw the video, I just... I  lost it. I was... it was completely out of my control at that point. So, when you kept asking me, uh, "What did he say?" I'm just like,  "Oh, my baby!" And then, I'm like, "Oh, my God! He's here!"  Probst: And what is it about that... that love... why is it... people say  it's only 30 days. It's not that long. <br/>I have never been away from my family that long, and to go 30 days without  hearing from them, without e-mail, without arguing, anything, I was just in a  drought, and I needed... I needed my husband; I needed my sons, and that day  just couldn't come fast enough. <br/>Probst: Let's go out... uh, Michael, let's go back out here. I'm-I'm liking going into the audience tonight because we have some people we  want to talk to. Everybody knows this guy here. Everybody knows this guy here. [applause] [applause] Former Pro Bowler. Eddie, you know, you kind of made your living... I mean, football being your  life, getting beat up for a living. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: This is not what your wife did. How proud of you... of her are you, and were you out there seeing... you got  to see firsthand how she was really living. <br/>Yeah, when she was gone, I had no idea what was going on. I had no communication with her. And when I saw her, I was just elated, and to see how much weight she lost...  I saw a glow in her eyes. It's something that she really needed to do and really find inner strength. She's the rock of our family. She... when I saw her, you know, holding the camp down, that's how it is at  our house. She keeps me in check. <br/>Probst: And I don't know if people remember this episode, but Eddie George  started fire like that. How did you know how to start fire? <br/>Royal Ranger. <br/>Now, I was... I was a Royal Ranger back in the day, so I-I had... I have some  skills. I grew up in Philadelphia, but I know how to start a fire, so if I have to do  it, I can do it. <br/>Probst: Next season, Eddie George. <br/>Oh, really? <br/>Yeah. [applause]  Probst: All right, well, everything needs a balance, and to offset the  loveliness that was Taj, there was the delightful nasty that is Tyson. Take a look. <br/>I'm going tribal all over everybody's asses. I'm probably not the stereotypical Mormon. <br/>He's naked! <br/>I think people appreciate that. You can look me in my sweet blue eyes, and I'll tell you sweet nothings, and  you'll believe all of them. If any ladies want my phone number, ask. [applause]  Probst: Tyson, what has been the reaction from the Mormon community to one of  their more outspoken Mormons I've ever met? <br/>You know, the people that come up to me in public love me, but I know there  are people that, in their hearts, probably don't hold that much love for me. But, you know, great men are either loved or hated: Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph  Smith even. So, it, you know... I mean, I'm not saying that I'm comparable to those guys,  but it's not only the wicked ones that are reacted to in that way. <br/>Probst: It may just take time to understand your place. <br/>Yeah, exactly. <br/>Probst: I get it, I get it. <br/>You hate me at first, then you grow to love me, then you can't live without  me. <br/>Probst: Yes, we've heard... we've heard the spiel. Sierra, first impressions in this game: from the get-go, these guys wanted  you gone, and it never really left. It's been a long time since somebody has been universally despised in a...  no, in a way that I didn't understand. What-what was it... was that a shock to you, to see how many people were  talking? Tyson was on you. Coach was on you. Debbie at one point was on you. <br/>Um, yeah, it was really hard. It was really hard to start out and get voted out, and then go back and make  the right choices. I knew that behind the cameras and by myself, I was making all the right  choices, and I was... I was honest. And I was... I was forthright to everyone. And I felt that I was a good person, but, I mean, it doesn't take a good  person to win this game. So I guess maybe if I went for my morals rather than snakes over here, maybe  I would have won, but...  Probst: What did you... Did you learn anything from this about yourself? <br/>Absolutely. I learned that I'm... I've been a dependent person on other people my whole  entire life, and I've learned how to depend on other people in order to  satisfy who I am as a person. And when the moment that they all betrayed me and turned on me, I found  myself. And I am so proud of myself because I stuck it out six days...  Yeah. <br/>...with ruthlessness, and I fought to the death, I fought to the death, and I...  I slayed the dragon! I slayed the dragon! [cheering, applause]  Probst: Sierra took down the  Probst: Sierra took down the dragon. dragon. All right. Well, up next, he was one of the most colorful, memorable, controversial  characters in the history of our show, the dragonslayer. Coach is next! Coach is next! [cheering and applause] [cheering and applause] [humming]  Who is this jackass? <br/>I am the last of the Mohicans, the Renaissance man adventurer. I've been through a hurricane. I've been attacked by a shark, captured by the Indian tribe, had a run-in  with a crocodile. <br/>Wow. <br/>Sounds almost too good to be true. <br/>None of us have ever done this in our lives. this in our lives. <br/>I have. <br/>I have. <br/>I want to change this game. I consider myself a Renaissance man adventurer. Iron sharpens iron, baby. I know who I am: unshakable, unbreakable, invincible like a sword. <br/>Probst: Dragonslayer. Coach wins immunity! <br/>I feel brilliant! Thank you for creating me as an individual. I am the last of the Mohicans. Boom. This is about me now. [screaming] Victory is mine. Victory is mine. [cheering and applause] [cheering and applause]  Probst: It's, uh, been a while since we've had anybody as colorful as you,  and controversial. Uh, like I said, the only other thing I was hearing on the street other than  "I want J.T. to win" is "Man, I'm so glad Coach is off." But I-I reckon  that the minute you were voted off, a lot of people missed you. I know I did. So what has been the... Taj is already rolling the eyes. <br/>I did not! <br/>Probst: It's like Tribal Council. What has been the reaction from people you don't know on the streets,  strangers? <br/>Yeah, I mean, most people are like, "Wow, you know, we watched the  season because of you." I think in the back of their minds, they might be  thinking, "Oh, I hate you." But they've been pretty cool. <br/>Probst: And what's been the reaction from people who know you? Is... do they... is this, "Yeah, that's-that's Coach. That's the dragonslayer. Sounds great." [cheering]  All right! You know, it's really been kind of like... they-they understand that  eccentric side of me. They understand that creative side of me, and also putting my stamp on the  game. I put my stamp on tribal, on my outfit, on the feathers. So I just like to make my mark wherever I go. There must be some eye-rolling up here. I like making my mark. Exile-- come on, I mean, that's heroic. Epic-- what can I say? <br/>Probst: What is the... okay, when you told one of the biggest stories ever. [laughter] I don't even have to say what it is. You're down the Amazon... "I'm setting a record, and I get captured by  an indigenous tribe who ties me to a stake, and then they're going to  dismember me, but I escape and finish the record." When you told that  story, could you feel the energy that night? Did you think, "They're... they... yes, they're glad I'm telling  this?" Did you think, "Oh, they're not buying it?"  It doesn't matter. When you speak the truth, you have to... you have to tell it, no matter what. I actually debated with myself. I'm like, come on, I've got a hundred stories that I could tell instead of  this one, but there was something nagging about telling that story. <br/>Probst: Well, okay. Now, I offered you a lie detector test. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: And you said no. <br/>Yes. <br/>I wonder why? [laughter]  Because I already proved him a liar! <br/>Probst: So, well, I was going to ask you about the... about the story down  there. So why did you say no to that? <br/>Well, what would that have proven? <br/>Probst: Well, I mean, some would say a lie detector test would prove if  you're telling a lie or not. <br/>Well, here's the thing, okay. Now you guys have handled my reputation for the last three months. And in this case, I did want to handle it myself. Now, we've all been blindsided up here at one time or another. You, my friend, my worthy adversary, have never been blindsided up. I did take that lie detector test from John Grogan, one of the authorities in  Hollywood. I have the sealed envelope here in my pocket. in my pocket. [cheering and applause] [cheering and applause] Now, in particular...  Probst: Coach, Coach. <br/>It's sealed. <br/>Probst: You love this. I'm reminding you, we have only a certain amount of time. <br/>Yes, I understand. <br/>Probst: Get to it. You can be verbose. I love this. <br/>I want you to open it, or would you like for me to? <br/>Probst: No, I would like open it. <br/>And in particular, I want you to read question #2. <br/>Probst: Okay, this says "Confidential report." I mean, I will say  it looks like it was printed on something that you could have in your office,  but, no. [laughter] No, it does. It has the guy's name here, conducted by John Grogan and Associates. There's a phone number. I'll be calling him after the show. [laughter] Count on it. <br/>I also have a videotape of this in case anybody out there wants to see it. <br/>Probst: Wow. <br/>In Hollywood. <br/>Probst: This is exactly what I was hoping would happen, and you did it. <br/>I know. <br/>Probst: Now, you did it in the safety of not any of us knowing, but you took  the test. What are the odds-- Mike, get a big shot of the house. What are the odds right now by sound that Coach is going to be proven to be  telling the truth? [cheering] Wow! Wow! All right. <br/>Looks pretty...  Probst: Wow, okay. Question one: did you play the game Survivorwith utmost honor and integrity? Yes. Question number two: on your trip... on your trip down the Amazon... were you  captured by Amazon... were you captured by natives? natives? Yes. [cheering] Coach, I am impressed. No-nobody... what's the deal? You guys don't... do you guys believe this test? [cheering]  They really do. <br/>Probst: All right, mixed-mixed, uh, applause-- uh, mixed feelings on whether  or not that was true. I... lie detector test seems to be valid to me. I believed you the whole time. <br/>I know you did. I know you did. <br/>Probst: I knew you weren't lying. All right, Debbie, I have a quick question for you. Going back to school, being a middle school principal. <br/>Right. <br/>Probst: When you have all these kids and you're playing a game that is  ethical and moral, and you have to make all the decisions, what was... were  you worried? What is... what has been the reaction? <br/>The reaction's been amazing and positive. And honestly, it's... this game is outwit, outlast, outplay, and you have to  lie in Survivor. Um, and everybody has understood that, really. It's-it's been amazing. The kids have been great, everybody. They loved seeing me looking filthy and gross. But other than that, um, it's... it was an amazing experience for all of us  involved. The kids loved it. <br/>Probst: I got to be honest. I'm still back on Coach. I got... who did you bring with you? I know we're running out of time. Who'd you bring with you? <br/>I brought my coaching staff: Mitchell, Latifa, Amber. I brought the author of my book. <br/>Probst: Yeah, yeah, yeah. <br/>Coach of the Coach, Brad Jordan, and a special lady friend, Melinda Trettner. <br/>Probst: A lady friend. Where's the...? Okay, lady friend. What's lady friend's name? <br/>Melinda Trettner. <br/>Probst: Melinda, stand up real quick. Come on. Question. <br/>Yes? <br/>Probst: Simple answer: is the Coach-- lie detector test-- is the Coach we saw  on the show, is that-- is that the guy you know? <br/>Unfortunately, you only saw Coach and not Ben Wade, who I know and love. [audience sighs]  Probst: So there is another side to him. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Dragonslayer doesn't make it into the bedroom or does? into the bedroom or does? [laughter, applause, cheering] [laughter, applause, cheering]  No, actually, I slay the dragon. <br/>Probst: You slay the dragon. <br/>Probst: You slay the dragon. All right. All right. Up next: one of these 16 Survivors is going to win $100,000, courtesy of  Sprint, simply for being popular. But first, taking us to the break, our Survivorcomposers, Dr. Russ Landau and David Vanacore. [cheering and applause] [cheering and applause] âª âª [cheering and applause]  Probst: All right, we are back with the Survivor: Tocantinslive reunion show. Since Thursday, viewers have been texting and voting online for the Sprint  Player of the Season. In other words, they've been voting for the survivor... which one of you guys  they like the most. The votes are in. One of you is about to go home with an extra $100,000. I have three names. [applause] The top three are... J.T. is one. [cheering and applause] Taj. [cheering and applause] And in one of the biggest surprises... Sierra. [cheering and applause]  You go. Go, Sierra! <br/>Probst: The winner, however, is not Sierra. [audience groaning] The winner is J.T. [cheering and applause]  Yes. <br/>Probst: Big night for J.T. That's 1.1 million. [J.T. talking quietly] All right, let's... [chattering and laughter] Let's do some  updates with some of the people we haven't talked to. Joe, everybody hated to see you go home with the injury. How's the leg? <br/>You know, Jeff, thanks for asking. I haven't been asked that yet at all up till... [laughter] No, it's great. <br/>Probst: Yeah? <br/>It's back to normal, yeah. I'm good. <br/>Probst: So you're fine? <br/>Yeah, I'm doing fine. <br/>Probst: Hard to come out of the show, though. <br/>It was horrible, man. My voice just cracks every time I talk about it, so... uh...  Probst: Yeah. Yeah. Sydney, what's going on with the modeling career? <br/>Well, um, it's been good. I mean, I haven't gotten too many shows, um, with Survivor, but, um, clients  are inviting me back because they've seen me on the show, so it's been pretty  good. <br/>Probst: Good. And you weren't too scarred up, like, out there. <br/>No, I only have a couple on my legs and arms, but not too bad. <br/>Probst: Spencer, youngest guy ever on the show, and one of the biggest fans. [cheering] Did you have fun? You were off way earlier than you wanted to be...  Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: ...but did you have fun out there? <br/>Oh, of course. I had fun on the truck coming in when we were taping the intro stuff. Like, that was a dream for me, so... No, it was a blast, for sure. <br/>Probst: I'm going to skip you, Sandy, and come back to you. Jerry, do you hear from the guys? You were in the service for a long time. Did you hear from your buddies, going... Either saying, "Way to  go!" Or, "What happened?"  What happened? Yeah. Yeah, what happened? But, uh, I just thank God for just allowing us to go out and take everybody  out into this harsh environment... I mean, it was dangerous out there. And bring us all back safely. So, that was a big, uh, attribute there, just to get us all back safely. But the guys do rag me all the time about it. [laughter]  Probst: Candace, I just saw you in a commercial. Is that... Is that what you do? I didn't even... I didn't know anything about this. <br/>I do a lot, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Yeah? <br/>Yes, I do. Um, thank you. Yeah, I just did a commercial. But, um, yeah, I work in modeling and acting, as well as consulting and, you  know, um, sometimes law. [laughter]  Probst: So life is going okay since Survivor. <br/>Life is awesome. <br/>Probst: Carolina, whenever you're first off... And a lot of times, you know,  it would be Sandy. You know, it would be the older person who would somehow get the boot. To have a young woman, attractive-- is it... It's unusual. Can you still enjoy the game? You can still enjoy watching the show when you were only out there for three  days? <br/>Um, I mean, it sucks getting voted out first. I should have kept my mouth shut. However, Survivorwas a gift. And, you know, I made it, out of so many people that love this game so much,  so this... Survivorwas a gift that changed my life. And I love all these people sitting here, and I'm so proud of Jalapao making  it all the way. So, I love these people. I have no regrets. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: All right, and finally, taking us to the break, Sandy... just  something crazy. <br/>Just something crazy? <br/>Probst: What's something crazy that's happened to you? <br/>I'll take out of my vocabulary that, uh, you never get a second chance to  make a first impression. I did. And I was glad that, you know, I got that chance. <br/>Probst: Yeah, you really did. Both you and Sierra did. <br/>I really did. Yeah, I went for the idol, though, and I said, "No, forget... forget  them. And I'm not going to build them anything." And they just voted me out,  and I was going to look for something to keep me in the game, but, you know...   Probst: Sandy, you look good all dolled up. Thanks for being out there. <br/>Thank you, baby. Thank you. <br/>Probst: Well, it has been nine years and 18 seasons of Survivor,and we are  not finished. The question is, where are we headed? Find out when we come back. Find out when we come back. [applause] [applause] [screeches] [growling] [hissing] [hissing] [squawking]  [squawking] [applause]  Probst: Welcome back to the Survivor: Tocantinslive reunion show. Before we show you where we're going next, J.T., when I asked your mom... I  said, "You know, your son's got a lot of money." She said,  "Maybe I won't have to worry about him anymore." Any plans? Is there something in particular you're going to do with some of that cash? <br/>Um, hopefully, use it to make a little more money somehow, but, um, I'm not  sure just yet. I'm definitely, uh, going to look forward to working with Stephen down the  road, I'm sure. <br/>Probst: Really? A partnership? <br/>I feel like I never could have done it without Stephen. Although I showed that on the finale. So, I feel... I feel obligated. <br/>No. We're not... I mean, we're not obligated. <br/>Probst: Oh, we're not back in Tribal. I don't even want to hear this again. Oh, my God. All right, Survivor XIXis just around the corner. Where are we headed next? Take a look. This fall, Survivorramps up for an incredible 19th season. Deep in the exotic waters of the South Pacific, 18 strangers will be  abandoned on the rugged islands of Samoa... a tropical paradise straight from  Robert Louis Stevenson's legendary tale, Treasure Island. This majestic land of towering waterfalls... mysterious rain forests... and a  fierce warrior culture will be the castaways' home for 39 days. Forced to work together, they must learn to adapt, or they'll be voted out. In the end, only one will remain to claim the million-dollar prize and the  title of sole survivor. Survivor: Samoa. Coming this fall. [applause] Well, I have to say on behalf of everybody that makes Survivor,we  really do appreciate the loyalty of you guys. And if you want to own a piece of Survivor,all you have to do is go to the  Web site being shown on your screen. You can own anything you've seen on this season. You can own J.T.'s torch. You could own something from Coach, I'm sure, or you could own this necklace  that will remain a mystery. Also, if you think you have what it takes to be on this show-- you've heard  how tough it is-- go to cbs.com. You can find out everything you need. Just put together a three-minute videotape. And all we want is you. You don't have to be Coach if you're not Coach. That is it. Thank you very much for your loyalty, and we will see you next time for more  Survivor: Samoa. Samoa.
