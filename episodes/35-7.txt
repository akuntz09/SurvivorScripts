<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," at the Yawa  tribe, three Healers, one Hero, and a Hustler remained undefeated. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Jeff: At the Levu tribe, Joe's game was looking up. <br/>Hello, baby. Oh, man. <br/>Jeff: At the Soko tribe, JP And Ali were on the chopping block. <br/>Ryan and I need to make the decision on which of the two  goes home tonight. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Chrissy and Ryan sent Ali home. Ali, the tribe has spoken. 12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight. <br/>I didn't want the smile  when she left because it was so sad she was leaving and I was so sorry for  her, and I was so happy for us and I was trying not to smile. <br/>She had to go. <br/>I have been playing this  game 24 hours a day. I think I am dominating the social game on this tribe, and both  guys are closer with me than they are each other. Wow, we made one more. We made top two-thirds. That leaves me in a very nice position on this tribe,  potentially the power position. I think where I am right now is setting me up for a nice future  run. <br/>If it's a challenge today, we're winning, guys. <br/>I feel really good with  my five here in Yawa. We trust each other implicitly now. We've been through hard things together. Ben is a good guy. Lauren, I think she's going to stick with us. Me, Mike, and Jessica, we're three Healers. We have that bond carrying over from the last tribe some if this  group just stays together, we can accomplish so much, and I don't think  anyone else will have that same unity. I don't see the other teams staying strong together. <br/>Right. <br/>So we have five people. I feel like come merge, we can probably draw in Joe and Desi. <br/>We all have to have a solid pact. <br/>We have to make a plan. We have to execute it. And we have to stick to it. If we go into a merge, guns-ablazing, five strong, we'll do all  right, but my biggest concern right now is Cole. Cole and jess sit down there and play patty-cake all night long. It's just hard to trust that. It's just hard to trust that. <br/>Things have to get better. Right now we're a broken tribe. It's two versus two, Devon and I against Joe and Desi. But on top of all, that physically we have nothing left. Our stomachs are empty, and you can feel that. We are out of all food. We have no rice left. We have no chicken left, no fruits, no vegetables. We have nothing left. <br/>I’m so hungry. Except a little tiny bit of sugar. <br/>Sugar for breakfast. <br/>"Survivor" is no joke. We're not joking if we say if we don't get food today we might  die. He's barely moving. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>You can do it, tv -- de ve. <br/>I’m running on empty. There is not a single calorie in my body that's usable. My brain feels dead and every single one of my limbs feels like  it weighs 1,000 pounds. <br/>This is the saddest point in my life right here. This game is a lot more real than I thought, and going into the  next reward challenge, if I don't get this win, I don't know what I’m going  to do. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. Wow, Desi, you are dragging. Yawa, Levu, getting your first look at the new Soko tribe. Ali voted out at the last tribal council. Desi, watching you just walk up this little five-foot incline of  sand, it was like you were trudging everest. Is that rally indicative of the wear and tear 17 days in? <br/>Absolutely. I mean, we've got nothing to eat at our camp, like not a single  calorie. I just want some fd. <br/>That's what I’m saying. <br/>I think we're all in the  same boat. We're all tired. We're all hungry. So let's get to getting, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: All right. Shall we get to it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: All right. First things first, everybody drop your buffs. You are merged. [cheering]  This is the greatest feeling ever, because you want the --  to make the merge because then "Survivor" starts. <br/>I’m Mike. <br/>What's up, Mike? <br/>That's when you start finding your true alliance, because  you have to be on the your game. The merge is first step to get to that $1 million. Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. [ theme song playing]  I really hope this means  food. <br/>Nice to meet you. <br/>New buffs. <br/>Purple. <br/>Have you ever seen so much love at a merge? <br/>Jeff: This is pretty good. I like it. <br/>It was music to my ears when Jeff says, "Drop your  buffs." I think I’m in a good spot. I have more numbers with the Healers. The Healers are five. There's only four Heroes and three Hustlers. In addition to that, nobody nose about the immunity idol I have. Right now I’m excited. <br/>Where's the food? <br/>That's the scary part of this. <br/>There's a catch. <br/>Jeff: So dr. Mike, immediately everybody started saying, what about the feast  and what's the catch? What is the feeling right now? Are you worried that maybe something isn't going to go the way  it usually goes? <br/>Season 35 of "Survivor." you never know what's  going to happen. <br/>Jeff: You're right, and typically --  Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: When you merge, you are rewarded with a big big  "Survivor"-style feast. That is not going to be the case today. <br/>Don't say that. <br/>Jeff: Because we got something better. <br/>Oh, no way. <br/>What you got? What you got? <br/>Jeff: We brought outback steakhouse to fiji. <br/>Give me that steak. Give me that steak. <br/>Jeff: Yes, the steak authority will be in charge of the  merge feast, and because outback steakhouse lives by aussie rules, which are  no rules, just right, your bone in, natural cut, beef  Ribeye, ribeye! <br/>Jeff: You like the ribeye? <br/>Yeah, that's my favorite. <br/>Jeff: Well, it will be made to order, cooked just how you  like it individually, plus baked potato with all the fixings, salad. Where's the lava cake? <br/>Jeff: The authentic chocolate thunder from down under. <br/>Alcohol? <br/>Jeff: Plus cold beer and gold coast rita. Outback steakhouse is waiting for you just around the corner. Enjoy your afternoon. <br/>I needed this merge so  badly. My tribe was a complete disaster. There's only three of us left. Making the merge, that's what you dream of. This is the playoffs now. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I can't believe this. <br/>Bone-in ribeye. <br/>I’m having everything. <br/>Welcome to the outback steakhouse. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Grab yourself a drink. <br/>Oh, my God. I am in just perfect bliss right now. <br/>To the merge. [cheering]  To make the merge is such an accomplishment, and to go  from such a low this morning to being with all these amazing people and then  to go to eat this outback feast with such happiness, I feel like a king, man. This is the life. <br/>Give me everything. <br/>How would you like your ribeye cooked in  Can I get two steaks? <br/>Yeah, you can get two steaks. <br/>Two steaks. <br/>Thank you so much. <br/>I usually eat on a  regular day 8,000 calories, so before the merge, I was just in survival mode. I like I just want food, and now after almost three weeks of  starving, we have outback steakhouse. [cheering]  Wow. <br/>The steak just falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. It feels like it's straight out. A dream. <br/>Oh, my God. That's so good. <br/>Best steak I ever had. <br/>Amazing. <br/>Thank you, outback steakhouse. <br/>If "Survivor" is a mountain, I feel like  halfway. That's how you conquer a mountain, one step at a time. <br/>Cole, I don't want you to faint. You have to order more. <br/>You can order more? <br/>I ordered three steaks. <br/>The is the first time I get to meet Joe. I'm so glad I spent all this time without Joe. He's loud and obnoxious. <br/>Tell us about the tribal council. <br/>I knew that was coming. I had to pull an adoll out, man. <br/>You had an idol from where, blue or yellow? <br/>Yellow. <br/>You're the first ones to know. <br/>Holy cow. <br/>Joe tells us there was an idol. The question is, does Joe have a second idol that he dug up at Levu? <br/>Chocolate thunder from down under. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I think that I love you. This aussie waiter, he brings me a thunder from down under, and  I’m like, I love your thunder from down under, and that's not something that  typically comes out of my mouth. Being a virgin, I try the stay moral and holy. Aside from the joy about the outback steaks, the goal kicks back  in. The goal going to the merge was to remain Yawa five to the end  -- me, Lauren, Mike, Cole, and ben, but we need to bring in at least two more  people to make the majority. I think we can get to the old Healers, Joe and Desi. So we'll see if it works. As long as no one tries to break away from the alliance, we'll  be good. <br/>So good. To the merge, man. <br/>I’m so happy to see you  again. <br/>I know. I was worried. <br/>The only one I’m concerned about is Joe. Joe went the Levu and dug up a second idol. <br/>Yeah, they're listening right now. <br/>Before the tribe swap, Chrissy and I were pretty tight,  but no one knows we were working together. And she's wanting to talk in front of everyone, and that's kind  of concerning, because I don't want us two to be considered a tight alliance. <br/>We'll talk when we get back to camp. <br/>Secretly. <br/>New that we hit the merge, everybody's starting from  scratch. You have to anticipate. There's in teams now. It's about me and my family, so moving forward, there's not  going to be all this camaraderie. It's going to blind sides, lies, and I’m sure someone is going  to cry. <br/>Look at all this stuff. This is like a new world. <br/>This was incredible. <br/>The goal was to get to the merge. Now first step back into camp, it feels like we've been given  new life. We have hampers now, multiple machetes. We even have these massive mails so we can build a great  shelter. But at this point in the game, all bets are off. People are going to be out for themselves, so the thought  crossed my mind that I should be looking for a clue or some kind of  advantage. But I couldn't find anything, but I feel like I need to keep  actively looking, just because people are going to be with other people now,  talking a lot, plotting and stralt jiezing, trying to build new alliances. <br/>Has Joe said anything about us working together? <br/>Yeah, he's good. <br/>What are your thoughts? <br/>I think we keep him  around as long as we need him. <br/>I spoke with Desi, and I was  pleased to hear that her and Joe were still working together, so now I have  all of the old Healers and Lauren and Ben from Yawa. That's the majority. I am feeling like a queen bee at this moment. <br/>Happy to see you. I was nervous the last one. <br/>I was nervous. I have been waiting to talk with Devon since we had swapped. It's like two old friends coming together. I'm looking forward to it being me, you, JP, Ashley. <br/>So you're tight at JP? <br/>Yeah, we voted together both times. So me, you, Lauren...  So that's us with the Heroes. <br/>Yeah. A Hero-Hustler alliance makes sense for us because unfortunately  there's only three Hustlers left, me, Lauren, and Devon. But I know I’m tight with two of the Heroes, JP And Chrissy, so it would be a perfect alliance, the like the Hustlers  and Heroes versus the Healers. <br/>I’m down with that. <br/>The merge vote is the cream of the crop of "Survivor."  this decides who is going to dictate the rest of the game. And a Hustler doesn't wait. A Hustler goes and makes alliances. <br/>We all do so well in the challenges. <br/>Oh, my gosh, like running on nothing. <br/>Yeah. Right now, looking at the 12 we, have I think strongest people  truly made it to the merge. But the Healers and the Heroes, they've seen each other as  threats this whole game. <br/>We're in a good spot, just to let you know. And us Hustlers, we've been flowing under the radar, which in  the merge isn't a bad spot to be in. <br/>We went off on our own, but I think it worked out best. We're in the minority, but everyone will want us. Talk to people, but don't give them any idea what we're doing. I've connected with everyone. I say we go with the Heroes. I say us seven take out the five. <br/>The Heroes and the Hustlers want the Healers gone. I really like dr. Mike. I made a pack with the last Yawa tribe. It does make sense for five of us to stay strong. <br/>The plan is for me, him and Ryan and whoever else to take  out the Healers tom me that's not good. <br/>1,000% together. I swear. <br/>On our children? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Lauren tells me immediately that Devon wants to get out  all the former Healers. <br/>I made a vow to you, Mike. <br/>I am concerned that the Healers  can be ganged up on by the original Hustlers and Hero, but the reality is  that we're still five Healers strong, plus I’m strong with Lauren and I’m strong  with ben. So the lines are being drawn in the sand, and I expect a war. <br/>I see three Hustlers,  four Heroes taking out the Healers. My eyes, my best-case scenario is to take out either Cole or Joe,  no problem. <br/>All I know is I could barely take a whole lunch with him. <br/>Yeah. Joe knows how to play the game, which makes him a threat to  others, and Cole is a physical threat, and if he does end up losing the first  immunity challenge, it would be a good time for him to go. It would be nice to be able to get the seven of us. <br/>So right now I’m listening to everyone, and I could go one  way with old Heroes and old Hustlers. <br/>Let's pick up some wood while we're going back so it looks  like we're...  Okay. <br/>See if we could get that Yawa five working. The question is can I trust Cole? <br/>How would you even use this cinnamon? It's kind of good if you just bite it. <br/>He's selfish, and I don't think Cole respects anyone here. He just respects himself. You need help to get to the end, period. Right now I need someone that I can trust. Cole is up there eating fricking cinnamon sticks. <br/>What? <br/>Yep. <br/>Cole has made some big mistakes, especially with food. He just doesn't think. And he goes off by himself. He doesn't talk to the group. He's food alone. You can't do that in "Survivor." but Cole is my number  one, and I just feel a connection with him. We have built a great thing together, and I need him here. So I think it's time for another chat. <br/>Don't do it. <br/>Okay. Did someone say something? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Who? <br/>Ben. <br/>Ben? <br/>Devon is on board with voting Cole or Joe. So I mean...  I feel like voting Cole  destroys the entire trust in our alliance of five. <br/>The Yawa tribe went in saying we were five strong. The problem is now Ben is wavering. <br/>It was just theorizing, nothing set in stone, but Cole is  the biggest threat. <br/>Let's worry about it one volt at a time. Because Cole right now is in your five. Post-merge dynamics are nothing I thought they would be. I imagined I’m the only person playing this game, but it ends up  that everybody is playing the game. That makes my life so much more difficult. Everything we've worked on in the last nine days goes out the  window if we vote him out first. <br/>Just because I went in here with a supposed alliance of  five doesn't mean that everybody is sticking to the alliance of five. <br/>Everybody's gunning for you. It's either you or Joe. Hustlers are gunning for the two of you guys. <br/>You still have me? <br/>Of course. <br/>You're still with me, right? <br/>100%. <br/>To have my name on the chopping block, I’m experiencing  that "Survivor" paranoia, but like in rock climbing when your gear  pulls, you're all the way on the top, and now you're on the bottom. My alliances are my gear. I just pray that's going to keep my life in "Survivor"  going. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. You guys ready to get to your first individual immunity  challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First things first, Desi, Mike, I'll take back the  idols. Thank you. Tribal immunity no more. This is what you covet in the game now. The individual immonti necklace. With this you are safe. Without it you are not. Shall we get to it? For today's challenge, you're going to stand on a narrow beam  while spinning a ball inside a circular wooden track. At regular intervals you'll move further down the beam, making  it more difficult. If your ball drops or you step off, you're out of the challenge. Last person left standing wins immunity, safe at tribal council. Loser, somebody will be the seventh person voted out of this  game. All right. Pick your spots. Here we go. Everybody start spinning your ball. Everybody is spinning. An your first individual immunity challenge is on. And just like that Ryan is out only seconds in. Ryan, take a spot on the bench. There are so many ways this game can get you. That hypnotic transthat's going to begin to get inside your  mind, that ball spinning. Don't let it lull you into forgetting what you're doing. You're going the make your first move now. You're going to put one foot on that beam. Now things get just a little more difficult. It's a tricky challenge. You have probably never done this before. How many people do this on a sunday in their backyard? <br/>Not even me, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Dr. Mike drops. Mike is out of this challenge. We are down to ten. Brand-new Survivor challenge. You'll be the first person to win it, and you will be the first  person safe at tribal since the merge. All right. It is time now to move one step further down the beam. Now bAlance becomes just a little more difficult. And with that Jessica drops, and we are down to nine people  left. Sweat pouring off of Joe's face. <br/>Yes, sir, yes, sir. <br/>Jeff: Can't stop to wipe that sweat off. <br/>No, sir, no, sir. <br/>Jeff: You cannot get lost in the momentum. That same momentum that you need in this game is what you need  in this challenge. Keep that ball moving. All right. It is time now to move a little further down the beam. You're now going to put one foot in the most narrow section. Do it in little increments. Ben struggling. Ben can't make the transfer. Ben is out. JP Drops. He's out. Devon is out, and we are down to six. Lauren drops right behind Devon. We're down to five. This third section getting a lot of people. Cole with a nice recovery. You can't get lulled in by that sound. It wants to seduce you into falling asleep. Joe drops. We're down to four. Desi, Cole, Chrissy, Ashley. Fighting for immunity. You got to find whatever it is in that tank, hang in there. Your odds are increasing with every rotation that you will be  the one that wins this challenge. The one that wins this challenge. Cole fighting to stay in this. Cole drops. He's out of the challenge. No sooner said, Chrissy drops, and we are down to two. It is Desi and Ashley fighting for immunity. Desi's ball moving slowly. Ashley's about twice as fast. Just different strategies, both work. You just got to keep you ball moving. The first individual immunity challenge. A big tribal council looming. We are 30 minutes into this challenge now. To put it in perspective, Ryan was the first person out at two  seconds. Who is good with math? How many more times longer have they been up than Ryan? <br/>30 minutes? 900 times. <br/>Jeff: Nice math, Chrissy. Desi and Ashley still going. 38 minutes. Chrissy, what is that times Ryan? <br/>1,100 and change. <br/>You have now been up there 1,100 times longer than Ryan. Put that on your resume. <br/>I will. <br/>Jeff: All right. It is time now to move into sudden death where both people go  down to the most narrow part of that beam. Three, two, one... Ashley inching down there. Desi wobbling. Ashley can't make the move. Ashley drops. Desi wins the first individual immunity, safe the unat tribal  council. <br/>Nice job, ash. <br/>You girls killed it. <br/>Yeah, girls. <br/>Jeff: Desi, come on over. [applause]  Nice job, des. <br/>Jeff: First person the wear this necklace. Individual immunity is yours. Safe tonight at tribal council. Cannot be voted out of this game. As for the rest of you, after 19 tough days, somebody will be  the seventh person voted out. It won't be you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp, see you tonight at tribal. Congrats. <br/>Going into a merge vote, it is of great importance to take  out a threat, and there are so many threats out there, so now is the time for  this Hustler and Hero alliance to come together and try to take out the Healer  tribe. <br/>Wow, Desi and Ashley, that was freaking impressive. <br/>Good job. <br/>I’m very worried. My name is being thrown around big time. There is a solid chance I’m going home tonight, and apparently I  have rubbed Ben the wrong way in my eating habits. I'm trying to find a way out of this currently and see what I can  do. <br/>Dude, I’m sorry. I know I rubbed you the wrong way with foodstuff in the past. <br/>I know you don't have no  body fat to burn on you. <br/>That's not an excuse. <br/>Exactly. That's what I was going to say. I didn't want to call you out and be a bad guy. <br/>I wish you would have,  because I do that stuff without even really thinking about how other people  are seeing it. I want to say I’m sorry and that will never...  The whole thing, catching fish and just eating it for  yourself, you know...  I don't even think about  that stuff, man. <br/>I know, bud. It's all good. <br/>Cole came up and apologized to me. I did my, no, bud, we're good. He's a fedded me this whole time I've been at camp with him. <br/>I appreciate you owning up to it, like that right there is the  first step. But separating away from the old Yawa tribe and voting Cole  could backfire on me later. <br/>That's all I want to say. <br/>I appreciate it. I have to think tactically and not emotionally. So tactically speaking, if I have to work with Cole to get  further in the game, then I will. <br/>My name is on the block. <br/>Yours on mine? <br/>Both of them. Not to toot my own horn. I should be one or two. When it comes to strategy, I get it. I'm aware I may be a target. I'm a strong player when it comes to strategy. I found the idol. People are terrified from that. <br/>Don't use this against me, please, guy. <br/>I won't. <br/>Me, ben, jess cash Mike, and Lauren, like we kind of have  like a pact, our five votes go the same place. Let me ask you a question: Could you bring Ben in? He's going to flip on y'all. <br/>Ben is playing both sides. My healing tribe has been compromised. They're definitely sipping on ben's joyce. <br/>You haven't been to tribal. Joe goes off in tribal. <br/>That's what I do best. If I’m feeling the heat, I have an idol. If I use it for myself or if I use it for someone else at the  last minute, I'll make my final decision. <br/>Talk to me. I feel like I’m on the outs big time. <br/>I've heard that Healers are targeting Heroes. I feel like you vote Chrissy, Chrissy being in the game is a  huge threat. <br/>She's a big talker. <br/>Yeah. <br/>She's so smart. <br/>She just through them numbers out there like nothing to Jeff. <br/>First person that needs to go is Chrissy because in this  game you got to get out the really smart ones. They can trick people some tonight we're going to be five Healers  strong against Chrissy, and I think I can trust Lauren to vote with us. Now we have six people. Lauren became tight with us at our tribe. We all became tight. We all trust each other. Just like...  That's the thing. Ben says he's with us, but he also has all of his Heroes back  now. <br/>Now the question becomes is Ben with us or against us? <br/>We need to stick to our plan with the five, and I made a  vow...  We need a Healer gone first. <br/>You think? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>But look, we're in the good with them. We can't mess that up. <br/>I don't trust Cole. <br/>I know that. I don't either. But listen to me, honey. Look at me. We're thinking about ourselves. <br/>Right. <br/>Okay. <br/>Ben and I, we've been together since Yawa. He was the only one from Heroes. I was the only one from Hustlers. Now we are in the middle. <br/>You need to think about it and let me know. <br/>Okay. <br/>This is a whole new game. It's so much to figure it out in your head and make a great  decision. It's very hard. <br/>You grace are thinking Cole and not Joe? <br/>It's Cole. And Joe is our back-up. <br/>I think when we go into  tribal, though, we play it off as if we're voting for Joe. That way Joe will play his idol. <br/>You don't think Cole has the idol? <br/>I don't know. <br/>Right now the discussion is whether to send home Joe or Cole. The tricky part is we don't foe if either of them has an idol. <br/>I think we need a plan  "B." Joe plays an idol and Cole stands up. Plan "B" is like the next person in line. Who one the next person in line? I think that seems to be...  We have to. <br/>I would be agreeable to  voting Jessica out, because we think that Joe might have an idol or give an  idol to Cole, and I think it's unlikely that Jessica has a hidden immunity  idol. Plus Jessica and Cole have gotten very tight, and we want to split  them up. I have been applying to this show for 16 years, so I’m a student  of this game enough to know that tribal is live and people do change their  votes, I just hope that I’m on the right side of it tonight. <br/>You're not talking to me because you're planning Cole, is  that true? <br/>Chrissy, she trusts me, so tonight am I going to have to  break that with Chrissy and vote her out, or break away from the Yawa five  and get a Healer out? I'm sitting in the middle, and having the choose a side, this is  the worst thing you can do in a million dollar game. But one thing is for certain, tonight is going to be battle  lines drawn, alliances Aligned, and war is not a pretty thing, and it's not  going to be pretty tonight either, because we're going to war tonight. <br/>Jeff: This is your first time at tribal. Grab an unlit torch. Dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual at tribal council, because in this  game fire represents your life, and when your fire is gone, so are you. All right. So the merge, significant because it transitions us into the  individual part of the game. Ryan, will rest go to our original theme where we have five Healers  left, four Heroes left, three Hustlers. How big a part was that this afternoon in looking at what might  happen tonight? <br/>Yeah, I think you have those original tribe divisions, but  you have the divisions that we were in for the last eight day, as well. <br/>Jeff: Dr. Mike, why not just say, let's just all agree to take out a Healer  and start leveling this playing field. They have five? <br/>That would be first simple move, but most of the players  here have thought about what the second move and the third move are. What I saw is people scrambling, people really nervous. <br/>Jeff, we can go back and forth and say, oh, I’m paranoid. I heard like three names tonight. So for all 12 on to be nervous, smell [bleeped]. <br/>Jeff: Cole, there is an answer you give at tribal council,  which is I’m concerned, and then there's the truth, I’m actually not  concerned tonight. And what they're trying to say to the people that they're Aligned  with, I trust you. <br/>Absolutely. I tried my best to make strong alliances and make sure those  bonds are tight, so I’m going to say it right now, I trust you and I’m not  worried. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, the definition of what makes someone a  target changes tribal to tribal. Did you feel that everybody was evaluating every type of threat  to determine who they were going to vote for? <br/>You have to think about everything. You know, are they a physical threat now? Are they going to be a threat later down the road? Or do they just flat out get on your nerves? It's just not about tonight. It's about every other night after this. <br/>Jeff: Chrissy, did you feel that, as well? <br/>Yeah, typically in "Survivor," right after the merge,  it is the physical threats, but this season we are looking at much more than  physical threats. <br/>Jeff: Joe, you seem to be nodding your head at that. <br/>I've been honest since day one. I'm strategic, physical, and I’m a smart dude, but there are  bigger threats out there. Everyone keeps talking about trust, but are you about that life? Because I’m about that life. I've been at tribal before. I told Desi, I got you, and we're both here today some do you  want someone that's throwing out names saying, I’m going to vote with y'all  this tribal, but next tribal see ya. All these people, that's all they do. <br/>Jeff: Dr. Mike, does that give you a little bit of comfort that if Joe is  telling the truth, that's good for me, because I’m a Healer, too, and so is  jess cash and so is Cole. <br/>Well, sure, if I wasn't at the bottom of the Healers. Joe says from day one, I toll you guys I got your back, except Mike,  and I’m going to say, hey, Mike, you're not in my circle of trust. Ducey. It was like, Mike is looking for the idol, but really Joe went  and found the idol, but we've mentionedded our bonds over time, I have a  certain love and respect for Joe. <br/>I’m sorry. Did I say I found "A idol" I found idols. Let's switch up the game. Let's not talk about this vote. Let's talk about next vote, because names are going to be thrown  around. Everyone is uncomfortable? Am I going to play it or not play it. I'm going to rock it for right now, so you all figure it out. I'm chilling right now. <br/>This is ridiculous. <br/>Wow. <br/>Cole, you had a reaction when Joe pulled that out. What was going through your head? <br/>I know the names that  were brought up today, it was me and Joe, and Joe's safe. I know I don't have that same protection. So it could be my first and last tribal. <br/>We'll figure it out. <br/>Jeff: Jessica, that is how fast this game changes. A bomb was just dropped, and I think everyone is going, it could  be me. <br/>Absolutely. Idols change this whole game. You begin to question your old alliances, your new alliances. Joe was on my first tribe, and so now I’m thinking, are we good,  deuces? <br/>Jeff, Joe does talk a lot, but Joe had my back since day  one, we found that first idol together. So it's moments like these where I’m sticking saying in my head,  I’m not worried. I trust you. <br/>The battle lines are drawn, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: What does that mean? <br/>We're going to find out who is Aligned with who, and  someone is going home. <br/>Jeff: You're right, because it is time to vote. Jessica, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. Now would be the time to do so. <br/>It's only right to start off fresh, this is for me. <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Joe will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote, Chrissy. Jessica. Chrissy. Jessica. We're tied, two votes Chrissy, two votes Jessica. Chrissy. Jessica. Three votes Jessica. Chrissy. Four votes Chrissy. Tied again. Four votes Chrissy. Four votes Jessica. That's five votes Chrissy. Tied again. Five votes Chrissy, five votes Jessica. Jessica, that's six votes Jessica, five votes Chrissy, one vote  left. Seventh person volted out of "Survivor," Jessica, you  need to bring me your torch. Jessica, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. <br/>Time for you to go. <br/>Jeff: On "Survivor," when battle lines are  drawn, it's not about who goes home, it's about who Survivors and the new  lines that are drawn. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org  Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor," the Healers'  future looks grim. <br/>It seems like the end of the world. <br/>We got completely blindsided. <br/>Jeff: But they're not going down without a fight. <br/>Come here, come here. Get it, j.T. <br/>Cole just started digging. <br/>An idol. <br/>Pandemonium is ensuing in front of me. <br/>I think I experienced the  biggest blindside of my life. My heart is broken. Who knew a game could crush you. I thought only guys could do that. I was wrong. Buttery miss Cole. I hope that he makes it far and maybe we can still have a date  when "Survivor" is over.
