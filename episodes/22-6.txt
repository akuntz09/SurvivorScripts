<br/>Episode 6 -  <br/>Previously on survivor. <br/>So far, Matt has been the only person to find redemption  at Redemption Island. <br/>Matt stays alive. <br/>He has won all three duels. <br/>Grab your stuff and await your next opponent. <br/>At Matt's old tribe Phillip is driving everyone crazy. <br/>It's seriously hurting my eyes. <br/>So Rob actually considered keeping him around for a while. <br/>As long as Phillip is aggravating everybody so much, it  takes all of the heat off of me. Maybe he needs to stay. <br/>Since throwing a challenge to get rid of Russell --  This is my last time playing this game. <br/>The Zapatera looks like they lost their mojo and were  bickering among themselves. <br/>David under pressure is really stressful. <br/>Don't even go there with that. I don't freak out. <br/>And even though Sarita is wearing thin on her tribe mates  the bigger targets were Krista and Stephanie. <br/>There is nothing we can do about it. <br/>At tribal council, kristen and Stephanie voted for Steve  but everybody else voted Krista. <br/>Krista, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Jeff: Now Stephanie has to scramble to avoid being the  next person sent to Redemption Island. <br/>Matt? <br/>Who is it? <br/>It's Krista. Are you dry under there? <br/>Yeah, for sure. <br/>All right, well, I'm definitely coming under there with  you. I was excited, I saw him in the dual and he has such a positive  attitude, just refreshing, I guess you could say, even with, within the first  five minutes I feel he has so much more substance than the people I have been  on the tribe for the last 14 days. You pray a lot? <br/>Yeah, yeah. I have been -- whenever I can. I really feel like god put me here. <br/>Me, too. I just wanted you to know that I am going to give you a run for  your money. <br/>Oh, trust me, I know you are. <br/>Krista came in tonight, I was pretty excited to see her at  first, but I quickly realized that she is a firecracker and she is here for  business. <br/>You are not sneaking under the radar, blondie. <br/>Neither are you, blondie. <br/>Hey! <br/>Too bad. You must have a lot of faith in people. Tribal last night got a little ugly but in the end Krista was  our vote, and to my surprise, Krista and Stephanie both voted for me. That was kind of a cold slap of reality. <br/>Playing a team --  It has nothing to do with you per se. It is about keeping the team with the strongest competitors. I know you are digging deep but it might not be there to give. <br/>I was trying to be delicate. I am going to, you know, not be too crazy about bashing people. <br/>I don't want to get sent to Redemption Island and right  now I am at the bottom, as much as I hate sucking it up with people who are  complete -- I will do it because I want to get further in the game. <br/>I'm sorry you are personally offended that I voted for  you. <br/>It is crazy. Where I come from, 13 years in the nfl and it is a gut check I  am definitely going to have to dig deeper, but her vote against me last  night, I consider it stupid. <br/>I think it was another poor move you have made. <br/>It's okay. <br/>In alliances. <br/>It's okay. I didn't ask for your opinion and if that is your opinion,  that's fine. <br/>Well, thank you for explaining. <br/>She is basically tightening the rope around her neck. If we have to go back to tribal she is out. <br/>We should have another beach day. <br/>I have an appointment with Natalie. I'm really scared right now. <br/>Ow! <br/>Sorry. <br/>Ow! <br/>Natalie and I kind of started a little spa today, we are  like clipping our leg hairs and like fixing our eyebrows. <br/>Like what are we doing right now? <br/>Rob's making a day bed. Andrea is pretending to help. Phillip is always checking on the fire. Like every 20, 30 minutes. However you can make yourself seem more comfortable, why not? I worked hard all of my life, I was a basketball player, in  pageants, it is not like I am lazy, Natalie and I have just been hanging. <br/>You want to give me a braidy braid? <br/>Yeah. Come sit down. <br/>Okay. <br/>What you guys doing? Hair? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>I need a french braid in these dreads. Right down the side. And a part right here. <br/>Give me the scissors. I'll take care of that real quick. <br/>You are not coming near me. <br/>I will get you when you're sleeping. <br/>Girls, I have a request. <br/>What's that? <br/>What? <br/>And that is every half an hour or so, check on the fire. <br/>You know, I do that. <br/>I know you do. <br/>I am not singling you out. <br/>Right. <br/>I am just saying, you know, I have been over there like  four or five times this morning just doing it, so what I want to try to do  like every 25 minutes, half an hour you work it out amongst yourself because  we have wet wood here for the next couple of days. <br/>Okay. <br/>I have it stoking right now. <br/>Thank you, Phillip. <br/>Thanks philly. <br/>If I go to Redemption Island before Ashley and Natalie,  there is something wrong with the game, because those two girls, they are on  a beauty pageant. <br/>That's their whole world, but it is hard to compete and do  anything when you have two girls who won't get off their butts and won't give  you real credit for anything. It reminds me of when somebody who don't like dogs had a dog. You have seen that. I am their redheaded stepchild. These two girls must go. They have been here 14 days and frankly, the pageant is over. <br/>I have a headache. <br/>I have a stomachache. <br/>Look at her comfort. <br/>It is really exciting. <br/>Awesome. <br/>Great. <br/>It was great getting my luxury item, provided some comfort  and just some strength of words of wisdom and nice, strong relationship with  the lord. <br/>It is something you can't find anywhere else. <br/>We give this day to you, lord, and we know whatever the  outcome is that it will bring honor to you, lord and we thank you so much for  letting us be here together on Redemption Island, lord, and help us to carry  on, honoring you. <br/>Amen. <br/>Amen. <br/>Krista is different from the other competitors I have  faced, for one key reason, it is both of us have really been struggling with  not having a faith community and other believers to kind of lean on and talk  with about our beliefs and how we feel. <br/>It certainly makes it a lot more difficult to compete with  her. Last scoop's for you. <br/>Oh. <br/>I definitely have a little anxiety about the possibility  that this could be my last day. <br/>Come on in. <br/>Andrea, and Natalie, take a seat. Julie and Mike, pick a spot and get to this. <br/>We are now bringing the competitors for today's dual. <br/>Matt will be battling against Krista, voted out at the  last tribal council. <br/>You guys ready to get to it? <br/>Yes. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: For today's dual you will use a grappling hook to  get three bags. Each bag contains a ball, once you have all three bags you will  use one ball to solve the table maze. <br/>First person to get it right stays alive in this game. <br/>Loser is out. Their quest for a million dollars kaput. This is it. One shot. Take your spots. <br/>All right. Here we go. It is do or die time. Survivors ready. Go. <br/>You have to retrieve three bags using the grappling hook  and stay on the platform while doing it. <br/>Matt with the first toss. <br/>Can he hook the first bag? <br/>Just misses. <br/>Krista really taking her time. <br/>Great first toss and with one toss Krista has secured her  first bag. <br/>Matt with a nice toss. Matt has his first bag. Gently pulling it back. Doesn't want to lose it. <br/>Krista readies her second toss. <br/>Another great toss by Krista. <br/>Two tosses, two bags. <br/>Matt now panicking. <br/>Matt with a nice toss. Can he secure a bag? It looks good. Matt with his second bag. Krista has made three throws and with three tosses she has  grabbed all three bags. Krista now unwrapping. Get one ball and start working on the table maze. <br/>Matt has one bag left. <br/>Big advantage for Krista. This could do it if he can hook it. Got it. Got to get it back. Krista has her ball and she is going to start working. Matt has his third bag and still looking for one ball. That's all you need. <br/>Matt, you need to get that bag on. <br/>Matt has his ball and working on the table maze. It is not a simple maze. <br/>There are a lot of places that ball can fall into a hole  and you will have to start over. Matt is going to have to pick it up now. He drops in a hole and has to start over. Krista coming up on a tough spot. She gets by it. Both Matt and Krista still alive. Krista took an early lead and has held it throughout this dual  but Matt is catching up fast. Matt is by one of the tougher spots only to find another one and  he gets by that one. Krista with another very difficult spot to get by. She is still in it. <br/>We are neck and neck in this dual. Matt with a nice job. Matt now has the lead in this challenge. Krista continues to fight. Matt has a tough spot to navigate, close to the finish. Krista falls in the hole. She has to start over again. Matt very close. Got to get it in that netting. Matt stays alive! <br/>How are you doing, Krista? <br/>It is a real reality right now that the game is over. So it is emotional. <br/>Well, Krista, you lasted a long time in this game. You are out of the game for good. <br/>You can drop your buff on the way out. <br/>Yeah. <br/>He's a tough cookie, but --  What is that, Krista. <br/>A luxury item. <br/>My bible. <br/>I don't have mine so she is kind enough to leave it with  me. <br/>Is that something the two of you guys shared? <br/>Yeah. <br/>You know, Matt is an extremely strong believer and I  think, you know, that might be one of the reasons he is doing so well out  there. <br/>Jeff: All right, Krista. <br/>Bye. <br/>Matt and I agreed at the end of the dual today it would be  god's will that was done and it was. It was my time to go. <br/>Krista left her bible to me and I can't explain how much  that meant to me, because that book just breathes life. I can never thank her enough. <br/>Jeff: Matt, once again, you seized the moment. Four duels, four wins. You can head back to redemption and await your next opponent. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Krista gave him her luxury item, a bible on her way out,  and they were so close, and then my whole image of Matt changed. I had a good vibe with him but obviously he bonded with Krista  just as well. So even though initially I want Matt to stay in as long as  possible, he can be a very dangerous as well. <br/>Is your tooth bothering you? <br/>Yeah. It's not my tooth. I cleaned it a little too much. And I got bacteria in it. It will go away. <br/>It hurts. <br/>Poor Sarita, she thought she had a cavity and said some  bacteria got into it, I don't know how she knows that. She is kind of a drama queen princess. <br/>Sarita, she is a two-faced girl for this kind of game. She cleaned her teeth with a piece of dirty stick and gouged her  gum. That's a good way to really get out of the game on your own. Out here, everything is nasty, and sticking stuff like that in  her mouth. I mean who in god's name would worry about your back teeth. <br/>You know what? Sarita's wearing on me. <br/>Sarita is going nuts too. <br/>I mean, oh, my god. <br/>Yes, really is. <br/>You have to figure out how to unseat her in the group. <br/>Because quite frankly, if it is me in a fight with them, I  will shoot myself. <br/>Stephanie is a capable competitor in the challenges and I  think unquestionably Sarita is the weakest player in the tribe. <br/>If there is a way to get Stephanie to be more a part of  the group and ultimately keep her I would do that to sacrifice Sarita. So I think you, in the sense that you may not have a lot of  time, you should try and talk to everyone individually today. <br/>I mean you cannot be pushy about it. <br/>I can't be pushy at all. <br/>I'm gonna go haul some wood in. &gt; I see the clouds coming in, pRobably going to get an early  rain like we did last night. I consider this the calm before the storm. You know, I have been frustrated with Natalie and Ashley, they  lay around when they see that there is work to be done, that I might be able  to use some assistance. <br/>He doesn't ask. He said, "Start gathering wood." that is not asking,  that is dictating. <br/>And the girls are getting the fruits of my labor but they  are not giving me one iota of credit for it, zero. <br/>And I am not going to stay there and say, girls, can't you  see how hard I am working, give me some love too. I am not going to play that game. <br/>What can the girls do? What do you want them to do? <br/>Nothing. But they are 19, 20-year-old girls, they are not going to do  anything. <br/>They are not going to do anything. <br/>And I am not going to be the one to try and tell them. <br/>I am not going to sugarcoat it anymore. <br/>It is like I asked you guys four times to help out with  the wood, you have been like statues standing here. <br/>Why do you talk to the girls a certain way but nothing to  the guys. <br/>I do. In fact I said would you help gather wood and they immediately  started doing it. <br/>Am I wrong? <br/>Did you ask them a different way, you come up to us and  say, "Storm is coming, gather wood."  I am tired of it. <br/>I tell you what, tomorrow I am fire free day. <br/>I won't have to say anything to the boys because they pull  their weight. We pull our weight and so does Andrea. <br/>She makes it right and goes get water and doesn't have to  be told. You lay here like beauty queens. <br/>I am tired of being the red stepchild to you too. <br/>Get off your butt and help out around here. <br/>Are you still talking? <br/>Yes, I am. <br/>You are going to see a new attitude of me around here. <br/>A new attitude, Phillip, we have seen it before. <br/>Cool. <br/>Get use to it, beauty queens. <br/>Thank you. That's a compliment. <br/>You see the fire is going, whatever and you won't do it  until somebody says something. <br/>We are going to walk away. <br/>Walk away and I will follow you if you want me to. <br/>If you want me to follow you, I will follow you. <br/>He is like mental, he literally has a mental -- somebody  needs to diagnose him. <br/>You lay around the entire day in your r and r mode. <br/>It is just annoying. I am done with him, done. <br/>If you don't like it, get tough. <br/>I think this is going to end up splitting the tribe. <br/>The best thing for us to do is keep winning and not get  rid of anyone, so immediately I said I need to take Phillip aside and I need  to squash this thing right away. <br/>I understand that you don't want to take it anymore and I  fully like I have been in that position and I get it, I just think at this  point the most important thing has to be team unity. <br/>It is like a peace process to bring the tribe back  together again. <br/>Phillip was right, the girls weren't doing anything but  the less they do the happier I am. I don't want them to work hard and, you know, giving us a reason  to write their name down and win a million dollars. <br/>I want to bore the heck out of everyone as much as  possible. <br/>That's the way I like it. <br/>Guys. <br/>He is not going to be very happy. <br/>The first thing on my to do list of trying to get back  into this tribe is to talk to Steve, but I hate apologizing for stuff like  that, so it is like, okay. Suck it up. <br/>What's happening? <br/>Hey, I am not really good at this, but I want to say I'm  sorry for voting for you. I know I kind of hurt your feelings but that's not what I meant. <br/>Stephanie took a moment and really tried to either play  the game a little better or try to win me over or really coming from her  heart, I am not sure. <br/>I appreciate you saying that. Thank you. <br/>That means a lot to me. <br/>Bringing us together, you know. <br/>I know. And it is good to have a positive attitude. <br/>I know she is working hard, so I am going to keep that  door open with Stephanie. I always try to believe in people until they absolutely, you  know, until I get stomped on. <br/>You want me to tell you the honest truth? <br/>Yeah. <br/>The name I do want to write down. I wanted to write down Sarita's name. <br/>I just see her as the weakest person in the tribe, but  it's just the position I am in-- it's like I have to keep that to myself. <br/>I am thinking it too. You're stronger in the challenges, you're stronger around camp,  you're stronger all the way around. <br/>Steve agrees with me that Sarita is a weaker competitor,  so I would love to go into a challenge where I could show off everything I  have and then Sarita is lacking and pick up her slack and win the challenge  and everyone is really happy with me and I would feel great. <br/>Any single thing would help me at this point. I mean, need to drag her down and bring me up. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. Mike, where is the animosity level right now between Ometepe and  Zapatera? <br/>I think there is a little clash going on right now, Jeff. You know, we are in the middle of this competition and both  tribes desperately want to win, so I think it is going to be a good challenge  today. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, are you feeling that? That there really is a rivalry? <br/>Oh, absolutely. <br/>Jeff: which animal are you using today? <br/>Both. <br/>Jeff: Both. Both? <br/>Both. <br/>Jeff: Steve, a little concern he has the gorilla and the  lion? <br/>Oh, forearm. <br/>Jeff: You catch that, Phillip? <br/>I caught it. <br/>Jeff: All right. I am ready to get to this challenge. Shall we? All right. First things first, I will take back the immunity idol. For today's challenge, two members of each tribe will be  responsible for launching balls out on to the beach where the remaining tribe  members will catch the balls. It doesn't Matter what color a ball is. If you catch a ball, you score a point for your tribe. First tribe to five wins immunity. The losers go to tribal council where one person will be voted  out of this game and sent to Redemption Island, in addition you are playing  for an award, the winner will be taken to a beautiful spot high on the  mountain overlooking the view where you will enjoy a nice picnic lunch. Sound good? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Zapatera, you have one extra member, who are you  going to sit out? Sarita, didn't even think about it. Sarita, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else I will give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. Launching the balls for Zapatera, Stephanie and David. For Ometepe, it is Natalie and Phillip. Out on the beach, the matchups, we have Grant and Mike. Nfl player taking on the marine. Big matchup. Boston Rob going against Steve. Deep in the back we have Julie and Andrea. And Ashley and Ralph. Here we go. Survivors ready. Three, two, one, release! Natalie goes sport and greg connects scoring one for Ometepe. Stephanie goes deep. Julie in and out. No score for Zapatera. <br/>Ometepe leads one-zip. Here we go. Three, two, one. Release. In the air with a line drive. Oh, Andrea makes a dive for it. Natalie goes short. Chris connects, chris scores another point for Ometepe. <br/>Good job. <br/>Natalie Grant connection is working. <br/>Good job. <br/>Get it in the net, guys! <br/>Jeff: here we go, three, two, one! Release. David is deep to Ralph. No point. Mike, trying to hold Grant, he can't do it, Natalie goes short  to Grant, Grant connects again! <br/>You have got to catch something. Come on. Good strategy between Natalie and Grant. <br/>All right. <br/>Is praying the strategy? <br/>Come on, guys, let's go. <br/>Jeff: Ometepe now leads three-zip. Playing to 5. Come on, guys. Here we go. Three, two, one. Release. Mike ripping Grant's shirt off. Natalie goes short for Grant. In and out. Stephanie goes deep, right there with another point for Ometepe. Steals one from Zapatera. <br/>Ometepe leads 4-zip. Grant rips off what is left of his shirt, presents it to Mike  who basically has been tearing it off every point. This could be the final point for Ometepe. Ometepe leads 4-zip. We are playing to five. Here we go. Three, two, one. Release. Natalie goes short. No, in and out. Steve --  Rob just misses the winning point for Ometepe! <br/>Mike and Grant have been going at it hard. Mike unable to score but doing his best to slow Grant down. That has not been particularly successful. Keep your eyes open. All right, guys. Keep it up, let's put it to bed right here. <br/>Ometepe leads 4-zip and we are playing to five. Immunity and a big reward. This could be it. Here we go. Three, two, one. Release. Stephanie goes deep. Boston Rob, in and out. Natalie goes short. Grant with the fifth and final point! Ometepe wins immunity and reward! <br/>Jeff: Ometepe, congratulations again. No tribal council tonight for Ometepe. Big reward, go somewhere different, enjoy some food. Head out and enjoy your afternoon. All right, Zapatera, grab your stuff and head back to camp. I will see you tonight at tribal where someone will be voted out  of the game and sent to Redemption Island. <br/>Our decision tonight is vital going into the next  challenge. We have lost two in a row and I have got to have a winning team  with the right attitude and a lot of fight in them. Not a lot of lip service by Stephanie and not a lot of uptown  girl like Sarita. It is going to be a tough decision. Oh, gosh. Are you kidding me? Man! <br/>Is this a lobster tail? <br/>Cookies! <br/>This is so much food. <br/>Oh, my gosh. This is the best reward. We have got food that we could have eaten for days. It was like fish, guacamole like everything we wanted to eat was  on the table. Yeah! <br/>Isn't this a great freaking view. <br/>This is ridiculous. <br/>What do you think the statue is? That is jesus for sure. <br/>Jesus! Watching over us today. <br/>This is everything we've talked about, you guys. <br/>Oh, yes. <br/>There's watermelon down here, too. <br/>No, that's hot salsa. <br/>Oh, even better. <br/>We show up at the reward, and we all know that there is  going to be a clue to the hidden immunity idol, because there is always a  clue so right away I spot the clue underneath the lobster tails in the  centerpiece of the table. At this point there is not any reason for me to do it, so I  realize if I can't get it without anybody else seeing that I got it, I am  going to let one of them get it. So Grant sticks his hand under and he grabs the note. <br/>Let's check out the view. <br/>This is amazing. <br/>Let's look at it to make sure it is not here. So as Grant is showing me the note, Phillip ends up walking up  the stairs and sees the note too. <br/>There was a little bit of like, Grant and I and we got  busted by the principal. <br/>What does it say? <br/>Back at camp. <br/>Huh? <br/>Back at camp. <br/>I am in an alliance with Rob, Grant and myself, in fact, I  caught the stealth, I am the specialist, Rob is the mentalist and Grant is  the assassin. <br/>Remember, boys, stealth. And yet today, when Rob and Grant found the clue for an idol  they tried to hide it. <br/>Well, hell hath no fury like a lion or a gorilla when he  thinks he has been provoked. If you are going to make an alliance with me you better adhere  to it because I am all about integrity. I served my country for duty, honor, country, that means  something to me, and when you try to trash on that, me and the united states  got something for you when you try that one, baby. I could dwell on a place of negativity right now based on what I  just saw, I am not going to do that. I am going to smile and when the time comes, I am going to kick  a little ass around here. <br/>As a result of the loss today we are headed to tribal  council tonight and it is going to be interesting. I have lobbied for Stephanie to stay and Sarita to go. Sarita is more like a team mom than a member of the team. That's not who we need. We need somebody who can actually contribute on the field. <br/>Sorry about that one, you all. <br/>We just weren't meant to win that one. That wasn't happening. We just got smoked. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It is more important than anything else right now. Think about that. <br/>What I think is happening right now is that David and Stephanie  are doing their damnedest to try to swap her name on the docket with my name. I would like to see Stephanie leave, but I am not really going  to go campaigning because I am the most loyal person that my tribe will ever  see and they all know that. <br/>Meaning we can't sit out any player. And the truth is, I know who the weakest player is physically  and that is Sarita. <br/>The guys like you more than Sarita. <br/>It is a trust thing. They really trust her. <br/>But if we don't have numbers going in the merge --  I know. <br/>-- you guys are going to be wiped out. <br/>It is not a done deal yet. We haven't talked yet --  I don't know what else to do. The best I can do is show how committed I am in these challenges  and you know what is important. It is important to keep our numbers. They know that I want it just as bad as they do, because I do. <br/>I can't be anybody else except for who I am. <br/>Well, yeah, that is just your personality. <br/>Strong woman. <br/>That means a lot to me. <br/>If they don't keep me, they are going to lose every single  challenge, because they are not going to be able to carry Sarita anymore. <br/>They are noticing that. I know dave is on my side. <br/>I am sick of losing. What do we have to focus on now? There is only one thing. Winning. Trust comes later. <br/>Sorry, guys. <br/>We know what our options are. <br/>Who are you voting for tonight? <br/>Stephanie is definitely stronger in the challenges, Sarita,  I have more trust in so it goes either way. <br/>I think they are both very weak. I give them both a one out of ten. I just disagree. I mean, I'm sorry. I just fundamentally disagree like -- all I care about is  winning. Like seriously all I care about is winning. As we go to tribal council, one thing we have got to weigh is if  Stephanie goes home, Sarita is going to be in the next challenge. Sarita just has kind of been cruising. Stephanie has more fight in her. If Stephanie can prove that we can trust her, I am not totally  opposed to keeping her around. It is absolutely not set in stone tonight. <br/>Jeff: David, take me back to the first challenge that you  threw. Voluntarily lost to get rid of Russell. How big of a regret is starting to settle in now? <br/>Obviously, we are paying the price now for having given  them a breath of fresh air in terms of moving forward in the game. Had we kept our foot on the throttle things may be totally different  in terms of momentum. <br/>Jeff: Ralph, let's talk about today's challenge, because  you guys just got destroyed in this challenge. <br/>I think we started the game out wrong today. We had no balls coming our way. If I had been shooting I believe I could have done a little  better. <br/>Sarita, why sit you out? <br/>I would liked to have been out in the field catching. <br/>I thought she was shaking in her boots when she found out  we were going to do a contact sport, but I am fine with her sitting out  because I don't think she is that great during challenges. <br/>Jeff: when you say you thought she was quaking in her  boots about doing something physical --  She was worried she was going to have to get in there and  physical and I was just like, I don't care, let's do this. Let's go, you know? <br/>But I didn't want to be the one that said okay I can  definitely do it and end up not being able to follow through. <br/>Jeff: So then you are saying you were glad to sit out  because then you couldn't be a goat? <br/>Well, no. <br/>That's exactly what she said. <br/>I am hearing the same thing you are hearing. That she wasn't going to put a fight about participating in the  challenge because she knew she was the worst, as a result of that she is not  going to be in trouble now because she didn't have any part in the challenge  and the failure. <br/>But I am not saying I am not good. I would have been fine to be out there. <br/>Bull ...  I am a big active member of this tribe and it is horrible  to watch that loss. I mean, I was really upset about the challenge as well, you  know, it is sad to lose someone, bottom line. <br/>Jeff: Do you buy that, Stephanie? <br/>Absolutely not. I haven't heard anyone complain as much as she does. So for me, my impression is, she doesn't want to be here. <br/>That's not true. You have no idea --  I am near you when you live --  If that's your opinion you are fine if you think that but  you are way off base. <br/>I don't think so. <br/>Well, that's fine but you are. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: Steve, is there any part of you that wonders, maybe Stephanie's  spunk alone is worth keeping her around? <br/>On the pro side for Stephanie, she is a warrior at heart. She works hard around the campsite. Sarita, on the positive side, is a trustworthy confidant. I would like to see her do more around the campsite and see her  pick up the challenge as well. You know, she is a bit of an uptown girl that I don't think has  gotten her footing out here in the wilderness yet. <br/>Jeff: Sounds like two of the positives are actually  negatives there but that could have been just my perception. To tell you the truth, Jeff, the tribe is too obsessed with  trusting one another at a time when trust is not the most important issue. The stage we are at right now focuses on putting the best six  out in the field to do what we need to do to win, trust will come with time,  right now we need to focus on winning. <br/>Jeff: Ralph what do you think of that strategic layout? <br/>Sounds pretty good. Sounds real good. <br/>Jeff: well, tonight's vote is clearly a big vote. Which direction is this tribe going to go? Let's find out. It is time to vote. Ralph, you are up. <br/>Maybe if you spent more time thinking about your actions  and how you fit in with your tribe, you would still be around. <br/>I will see you on Redemption Island. I will kick your ass then. <br/>I made the best arguments for you, Stephanie, hopefully  this works. <br/>Jeff: I will go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final, person voted out  will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I will read the votes. First vote, Sarita. Stephanie, one vote, one vote Sarita. <br/>Sarita, two votes Sarita. Stephanie, that's two votes Stephanie, two votes for Sarita. Stephanie, three votes Stephanie, two votes Sarita. Sixth person voted out of survivor Redemption Island, Stephanie. That's four, that is enough. You need to bring me your torch. Stephanie, the tribe has spoken. But you will have a chance to get back in this game. Grab your torch. Head to Redemption Island. <br/>Jeff: well, you made the decision to go with somebody you  think you can trust versus keeping somebody that might have done better at  challenges. We will know soon enough if you made the right call. Grab your torches and head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. Next time on survivor. <br/>One of the most difficult aspects of the game of survivor  is mental fatigue. <br/>I am losing my mind. <br/>Dave is bugging me. He's a loose cannon. <br/>Crazy, crazy, crazy. <br/>Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob. <br/>If we lose, the target is on me. <br/>Wow. My strategy out here is to be brutally honest about Zapatera  tribe. <br/>No way. You don't want to align with my people. <br/>I don't think I do. <br/>They are not nice people, when it comes down to it. <br/>When I win, I am not going back to them. That is obvious.
