<br/>[ speaking Spanish]  [ speaking Spanish]  JEFF Probst: We've returned  [ speaking Spanish]  JEFF Probst: We've returned to the waters of the Pacific  Ocean just off the coast of Panama for the greatest Survivor yet. In order to ensure top secrecy, we are under full military  escort. The air space has been shut down. The waters have been cleared. Just below me are three boats, all out of sight of each other. Onboard each boat, six people. These are the Survivorallstars, 18 former castaways returning to  play the ultimate game one more time. Each survivor has been given one canteen and very little information. Aside from their own tribe mates, they have no idea who else is  in the game. They don't even know there are three tribes. When they arrive at their respective beaches, they will find  only one machete, to be shared by the entire tribe. And that's it. No food, no fire, no help. It's the least amount of supplies ever given to a group of  survivors. They say they're the best of the best. Well, it's time to prove it. Have they learned from their past, or are they doomed to make  the same mistakes again? And will old relationships come back to help them or haunt them? 39 days, 18 all-stars, one survivor. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION  Probst: These 18 all-stars divided into three tribes are  about to begin the most competitive Survivorever. The Mogo Mogo tribe, which will always wear green, consists of:  Jenna Morasca, winner of Survivor: Amazon. Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien, Survivor: Marquesas. Richard Hatch, winner, Survivor: Borneo. Colby Donaldson, Survivor: The Australian Outback. Lex Van Den Berghe, Survivor: Africa, and Shii Ann Huang,  Survivor: Thailand. The Saboga tribe, which will always wear yellow, consists of  Rudy Boesch, Survivor: Borneo. Tina Wesson, winner of Survivor: The Australian Outback. Jenna Lewis, Survivor: Borneo. Ethan Zohn, winner of Survivor: Africa. Jerri Manthey, Survivor: The Australian Outback and Rupert  Boneham, Survivor: Pearl Islands. The Chapera Tribe, which will always wear red, consists of: Rob  Cesternino, Survivor: Amazon, Rob Mariano, Survivor: Marquesas, Alicia  Calaway, Survivor: The Australian Outback, Sue Hawk, Survivor: Borneo, Amber  Brkich, Survivor: The Australian Outback and Tom Buchanan, Survivor: Africa. [ whooping]  My tribe is a very eclectic group and it's gonna be really  interesting to watch how this shakes out. I can't wait to start wheeling dealing and building shelters and  winning challenges and vote people out. <br/>You know, it's hard for me to realize-- I'm 48. I've got young 'uns their age, but I'm here for the new race. This ain't a little boy's game. It's for the big boys. <br/>All-Star Survivor is gonna be so cut-throat it's not even  gonna be fun. Nobody trusts anybody. Nobody. Nobody trusts anybody, you understand? <br/>Well, let's see. <br/>Hey, we got a machete anyway. <br/>Yeah, we got a note. <br/>All right, honey. <br/>You ready? <br/>Yes. <br/>It's a map. <br/>It's a map, to the water and to the burnt log. <br/>It's weird, because we know each other. You know who to be careful of, who not to be careful of, who are  friends, who are not friends. Like, everybody knows, if you push my buttons you may get me to  crack, an-and that could be my demise. <br/>Is that way...? Which way is north? <br/>Hey! I-I... Hey, I think this is it. We've either found the water oror a big john, one. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>That looks like milk to me. We have well water, and it's highly contaminated. You're gonna get all these diseases if you don't boil it. We have no fire. I mean, it's just like they dropped you off, all right, go. Go ahead. There's a cooking pot and machete... a water source. What you would do? <br/>Our supplies here are extremely meager. As all-star survivors, we don't have anything to build a fire  with so, I think shelter is the primary concern. <br/>What about this space right here, you guys? <br/>That's real solid. <br/>We go all the way across. <br/>Right to there. <br/>The best way to do it...  We got a team. The first thing we want to do if we wanted to be a team... It  wasn't five minutes, they was six ideas on how to do everything. <br/>Are all six of us going to go to sleep at the same time? <br/>Instead of going there, we're going this way. <br/>Yes. <br/>Why don't we try to do it right from the beginning? You know? I'm not trying to be a bitch, but it's like-- do it right, babe. I'm definitely vulnerable. I'm the first one out... because I'm the most outspoken. <br/>What do you think? <br/>Tom is weird. What's he's worrying about the ... roof for? Okay. Um, I'm okay now. Let's grab that big one there...  All right. <br/>...and put it right here, Rob. <br/>We're putting it over here now? Now we're moving again? I didn't know I was gonna be again on the buffoon tribe, but  apparently I'm the brains behind this operation, so I'm gonna have to make it  work somehow. <br/>Saboga. <br/>Is that a machete? <br/>It is a machete. <br/>Yay. <br/>A map. <br/>We are here and the water is there. <br/>First impression of the group, I'm happy with the group. You know, you got the mom, the nice guy, the military guy, the  hot chick. We're all going to play this game, and we're all going to battle  for this prize, and it's just, it's amazing that all these different styles  of play are going to come together. <br/>Rudy! <br/>What do I look like, Magellan? [ laughter]  I did this again because it's part of my being. It's not about the money for me. It's all about life experiences. And whenever I kick the bucket one day, I am going out with a  casket full of life experiences. <br/>Rupret? <br/>Rupert. <br/>Sorry. Rupert. <br/>How are you getting there, just cutting through here? I'm the new guy on the block, you know. All these people know each other. <br/>Take a right. <br/>Right now I'm just trying to stand back and let all these  egos decide what we do and I'll be the worker bee. New strategy for a new game. <br/>Rupert, look at this. Holy cow! We're in banana heaven! <br/>We're in paradise. <br/>We really are. Okay, we have so many bananas, but they're not quite ripe. When we got on the boat and I saw everybody, I was ecstatic. Rupert and Jerri are in my league. Rudy, perfect ally. Tina and Ethan, two winners. Done. It's so easy to convince the others to vote off the two winners. <br/>Banana tree was a deadend trail. We're following whatever trail was by the banana tree. <br/>I feel very vulnerable. I did get put on a team with a woman who doesn't like me. Tina is a huge concern of mine. She didn't like me in Australia, and I don't know necessarily if  she likes me now. But I'm going to try this new strategy of mine and that's just  to keep my damn mouth shut. <br/>Lookit. <br/>Yay. <br/>Oh, yay. <br/>Yes, that's very good. <br/>Oh, nice. <br/>We did find our water source but we can't drink it right  out of the well. There's potential brain parasites that will put you in a coma,  so it's not something to be taken lightly. <br/>Take a pot of water back with us. <br/>No, no, no, no. We have to boil it, Rudy. Five minutes, we have to boil it. <br/>We'll boil it, we'll boil it. <br/>You know, I drank bad water all over the world, in Vietnam  and Russia, and it never bothered me. I drank dirtier stuff than that. <br/>I like this spot. <br/>I like this spot for shelter. <br/>This is my vote. <br/>What do you think about this, Kathy, for a house? Give you all reasons. There's a little breeze, but we'll put the fire closer to the  water where there's even more breeze 'cause that's where we'll mostly be  hanging out, I think. <br/>I don't see why not. As long as there's a breeze to keep the bugs away. <br/>We've got to have a fire, and we've got to have a shelter. We know where the water is. <br/>You guys get bamboo...  We're going to bring, yeah, building materials as far as  bamboo. I think I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a day that went by,  since being in Africa, that I didn't think at some point, even if it was just  for a moment, about Survivorand about the game and about the possibility of  coming back one day. <br/>We can use that tree and the "Y" there and lay  one beam in there and that will be the high side. It'll angle this way. We don't need it any higher than that. It's never been done before. No one's ever gone back to play this game twice. It changes the game completely, not from a physical standpoint  but psychologically we know how bad gets and we know how long this road is. It'll be interesting to see who's up for that. Are you guys all cool with this thing? <br/>No, that's fine, yeah. <br/>I just can't believe we're here. Like, we're such morons. You left everything you love to come starve and have no water,  have no fire. Seriously, we've got issues. <br/>I know they're making alliances. <br/>I told you it was going to be them against us. <br/>It's the guys and the girls, totally. I totally know it. <br/>Hey. <br/>Yeah? <br/>Those girls are plotting, honey. Hope you aren't plotting with them. <br/>No, we didn't get into anything, honestly. <br/>People are a little bit paranoid and that's a good, good  state to have them in. Suppose I ought to be as well, but...  The guys have got some scheme. You can feel it. <br/>I think Colby and Lex are, like... Richard...  I think they are. I think they are. I really do. There is a girl thing that got manifested, and so we were  talking about it. And did we even think of doing a 360 to look around if anybody  was listening? <br/>Let's talk about that since I was sitting in the woods  listening to the girl power. [ laughs]  There is too much girl power. So our alliance wasn't too good. So with that, we just aired out all our dirty laundry. <br/>Boys, I told them what I heard about the girl power and  they think we got boy power going. <br/>You know what? Let's just call a time-out...  I agree. <br/>We have so much time to do that later. Let's just have a good time now. Let's win challenges when we have to win challenges and let's  get a comfortable shelter going. <br/>I don't trust any of you sons of guns. <br/>I don't trust any of you! <br/>I don't care whether you're a man, or woman. I don't trust you. <br/>Let's just win and then we won't talk about this for  another...  We can definitely put this on the back burner for a while,  can't we? <br/>Survivor: All-Stars is a different game and I'm figuring  out how to play it. So I've really got to push and probe and stir the pot a little. I'm just a big-ass target, Doesn't matter what I do. Just going to keep shaking things up a little bit. <br/>Richard, do you know where we can find a rock that might  start the fire with a knife? <br/>A rock against steel, you think? <br/>Oh, are you naked? <br/>Wouldn't that be shocking? <br/>It would be shocking. Yeah, he's naked. Okay. <br/>All right, we'll be back. <br/>That's enough. This is off to an interesting start. <br/>There it goes. <br/>This it is. <br/>Keep going. This is it. <br/>Come on! Come on! [ grunting]  All right. <br/>We have to be able to boil the water. The first tribe in this game that gets water and fire is a tribe  that's going to go the farthest. <br/>This is burning hot. Burning. <br/>I've so been where you're at right now. I did it for two days in Borneo. I can't do fire. I have tried. <br/>All right, there's that positive attitude we're looking  for. <br/>I killed myself probably three hours each day to try to  start a fire. You guys have just started. <br/>So far, Sue has yet to help us on the fire. She says, "I can't do it." Wherever... Borneo, where  the hell they went last time. Well, this ain't last time. This is this time. <br/>I am not going to let myself even get close to dehydration  because it's hard to bring yourself back from it, especially in this kind of  situation. Got to drink it. I lived in Canada for six years and I drank the water right out  of the lakes. Right out of the lakes. No filter system, nothing. The way I see it, I drank enough beaver poop in my life that my  body can handle what might be growing in there, eh? <br/>You drank the water from the well? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Without boiling it? <br/>Rob, I've probably dranken worse water. <br/>How much of it did you drink? <br/>I drank four big coconut... I left the coconut shell up  there. It's, like, three-quarters of a coconut shell. <br/>Can anybody say "dumb ass"? <br/>I drank four of 'em. I actually got too full. I wanted to drink more, but I'm too full. <br/>That's a lot, Sue. <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I don't know what Sue is up to. If you get sick and you have to check out of this game, you're  leaving five other people here to do the job of six. <br/>If she's going to drink it, she's going to drink it. <br/>If it's going to kill her, I don't want to leave her half  dead because it will be a ... mess. <br/>It would stink. And we'll have to clean it. <br/>It'll be like a corpse. <br/>Got smoke, got smoke, got smoke. Some smoke. <br/>Come on. <br/>I can't. I can't. We're all dying of thirst. We needfire. My head's ready to pop. We need to be able to boil water. We could be like Rudy and just grab the water and drink it, but  none of us want to die. <br/>It's burning my fingers. <br/>We're so close. [ Ethan grunting]  We tried with the fire plow forever. Nothing happened. We got a curl of smoke and we were like cavemen, but that's not  fire. <br/>Once you work this bow, it causes friction. A lot more friction than that way, you know? I mean, if you want to do it the right way, this is the way. <br/>Well, so that didn't work. <br/>Nope. <br/>I mean, unless God strikes a log around here with  lightning, we might never get fire. <br/>We definitely need something right now to give us some  hope. I think everybody's starting to feel a little...  Feel worried. Not a little. Feel worried. <br/>I'm glad I'm not alone. <br/>No, you're not alone. I'm worried as hell. <br/>We've been given nothing, and the realization of it has  now hit home. No one's going to come in and save us. We have to save ourselves. [ Rupert sighs]  You know what I think? Me and you ought to think about an alliance. <br/>You're a man of your word, too from what a know of you. I am, too. Rudy looks at me and the first time he sees me, you know, all  tie-dyed and hippie, he looked right through it and wanted to be my buddy. <br/>Tina and Ethan are good buddies. <br/>I know. <br/>The other two are good buddies. <br/>I know. <br/>We could be out of this thing in a hurry. <br/>Yup. <br/>I figured me and Rupert ought to protect ourselves and  form an alliance, and that's all we did. He says, "I can depend on you," and he says, "You  can depend on me." That's all I got to hear. <br/>You and I are going to be strong to the end. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Rudy is a man of few words, but from what I gathered, he's  a man of honor. If he and I stick together, if we can just make it through these  first few days, he and I will stick together through the end of the game. <br/>I'm dying. end of the game. <br/>I'm dying. I didn't sleep at all last night. Every two seconds, rolling over, getting bit, I don't think I  can do another night like that. <br/>No. <br/>I am beat right now. <br/>You know what? I don't want to do another night like that. <br/>Last night was by far the worst night I've ever spent in a  Survivor. I would have built a shelter completely differently. I'm in construction. I know what I'm doing. <br/>Once we get fire, we can make everything else happen. That's the thing. <br/>That's the thing. <br/>We got our shelter, good. I don't even want to think about that shelter until we have  fire. I don't even care about it. I'll sleep on the beach if I have to, but we need to have fire  to get some water at this point. <br/>I'm more than willing to work on the fire issue, but all  aspects of our shelter should have been created differently. These flat pieces are no good. <br/>It's my back and my shoulders and arms touching the wood. <br/>And the sand. <br/>Yeah. <br/>There are six people here without water. Two people are more concerned about the bottom of the shelter  because they're not comfortable at night sleeping. There's not one person here that doesn't understand that you two  have not been able to sleep. Six people haven't had water. That's what I'm thinking. <br/>We've been busting our ass trying to make fire since we  got here, since day one. <br/>You keep giving up on it, though. <br/>Every single day. We haven't been giving up. We're physically exhausted. We're dehydrated. <br/>Don't yell. <br/>I'm not yelling, I'm just saying call it like it is. <br/>I am calling it like it is. We just talked about it. We all are calling it like it is. <br/>I'm not going through another night over here with no  sleep, that's all. <br/>I was sleeping in the same thing you guys were. <br/>We didn't sleep, though. <br/>I never heard so much cry baby, titty sucking in all my  life. We bitched about the clothes, we bitched about the weather, and  we bitched that God ain't give us no water. We're going to have to toughen up a little bit. <br/>Are you two happy with this? <br/>Yeah because we don't want to do it again. <br/>Thank you. That's all I care about, really. 'Cause I have been able to sleep. I want you guys to be able to sleep. <br/>What can I say about Alicia? She's a drama queen. You want the fact, you come to Mariano, you get it as it is. She's a drama queen. <br/>Let's start this freaking fire. Somebody has to say something. They can't just do that. Who made Rob the master of this camp and Amber his little  in-pocket girl? When did that happen? <br/>What do you think? You want to make an alliance and cover our own asses? <br/>I don't know if I can take you seriously or not. <br/>I'm being 100% serious. Just we can't make it obvious at all. Like, I'm carrying logs with you right now. It's got to end. <br/>Right. <br/>All right? <br/>All right. <br/>Do you want to? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Amber and I have an alliance for obvious reasons. She's beautiful, obviously, any idiot can see that. But I'll keep my word no matter what to her. I trust her. I don't think she's going to screw me. <br/>Switch up. That thing is so hot. Do you want me to take over? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, all-stars. Boy, that's the kicker. I think within the last 24 hours we've all questioned, at least  half a dozen times, why in the world we signed up for this. <br/>Maybe there's something in there. <br/>I'm running out of steam. <br/>Yeah, I think I could start the fire without even  blinking. But they don't need to know that. [ laughs] But I have no interest in trying. Look at how skinny they all are. They'll be dying in no time. I'm fine. I'm not even hungry. I'm playing that one by ear. They could think I'm just cocky and arrogant and think I could  last the whole game. Hmm, imagine that. <br/>Sorry I'm not very helpful. <br/>No worries. If you don't feel well, save yourself in case we have a  challenge. <br/>And I'm just frickin' busy, so I'll get to you when I get  a chance. <br/>Richard is totally obnoxious. He's going out of his way to not do any work. I think Richard wants to stand out. I think Richard wants to be special in our group. It's just part of his strategy to kind of be like a little bit  shocking, like "I don't really care what happens..."  Man, when we... when we get to the players splitting  this... splitting these things, and we need more chopping...  Cool. <br/>...you know, then you can help. [ pounding continues] Richard Hatch was the very first person to  win Survivor,ever. He spent the last couple, three years since he won Survivor  talking about how he is just the best this game has ever seen. <br/>I love the fact that he's just, you know...  Lounging, lounging. <br/>Lounging in his birthday suit. He isthe king! <br/>He was the king when he was playing with a bunch of sheep. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>That's true. That's true. <br/>That was like shooting fish in a barrel. [ laughs] This is a whole 'nother thing altogether. <br/>He's the prototype for all of us other survivors, so of  course everyone wants him down. Everyone wants to dethrone the king. I mean, are you doing this, like, alone thing on purpose? 'Cause it...  Kind of. Um, I'm off by myself so people can see I'm not... Yeah, you  guys can be all talking together. Four of you went off into the woods while I was out floating. <br/>Yeah, but we weren't talking about anything. <br/>Maybe, but you know what I mean? I can't know that. <br/>Sure. <br/>And have at it, you know? <br/>I personally think... what fun would it be if the king  left the first day? It wouldn't be any fun. <br/>Ah, tree mail. It wouldn't be any fun. <br/>Ah, tree mail. We just got our first tree mail today, a little earlier than  expected. But I guess today is just as good as any day, being that we'll  probably just be thirstier tomorrow. Well, I've got some good news and some bad news. <br/>Uh-oh. <br/>The good news is, I've got another pole for us to sleep  on. Thisis the bad news. <br/>What's bad about that? That's good. <br/>Hey, you want to read it as a group? <br/>Sue, you want to come over? <br/>Just speak up. <br/>Probably start it now. <br/>Just speak up! <br/>"To and from each challenge, fly your colors as you  stride. In a show of unity-- unity-- your flag shows tribal pride. Three more days are guaranteed for those triumphant in the game. Bring your dive mask with you to face the man of flame."  That must be Richard Hatch. <br/>Just got our tree mail, our first free mail. And it seems to be an immunity challenge, but we're hoping with  an immunity challenge, we can win some fire, 'cause our tribe is, uh... we're  hurtin' pretty bad. <br/>It is killing me not knowing who else is here. Every freaking survivor could be here. I don't know, and I can't wait to find out. <br/>Probst: Chapera, come on in. What's going on? [ laughing]  We want to ask you that question. <br/>Yeah, seriously. We want to know. <br/>Probst: You want to see who you're playing against? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Probst: Mogo Mogo, come on in. More familiar faces. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Hi. <br/>Probst: Any surprises so far? Hatch, surprised to see anybody over here from Chapera? <br/>Count them gone, Jeff, count them gone. One, two, gone! Who are they? Egh! <br/>Probst: He hasn't changed at all, has he, Sue? <br/>People, ready to leave! <br/>His team looks like they love him already. [ laughing]  Probst: Well, 12 survivors would be nice. Two tribes would be fun. Not enough. Saboga, come on in. <br/>Ooh...  Oh-ho! <br/>Rupert! <br/>The big man in the back, there he is. All right. Game on! <br/>Probst: All right, here we are. Survivor: All-Stars. So, tell me about arriving at beach. Big Tom, what'd you find when you got to camp? <br/>Nothin'. <br/>Just a knife and machete, a machete. <br/>Oh, yeah, and a bucket. <br/>Probst: You got a machete? <br/>Yeah, and a bucket. <br/>Probst: What else, Hatch? <br/>We got a pot. <br/>Probst: Rudy, did you get a map to water? <br/>A map to water, a machete and a bucket. And we can't drink the water. <br/>Probst: Why? <br/>'Cause we don't have fire. <br/>Probst: You don't have fire? <br/>No. <br/>Probst: How about Chapera? <br/>No. <br/>Probst: Hatch, I know you have fire. Nobody has fire? <br/>No we haven't got it yet. <br/>No fire. <br/>We got smoke. <br/>Probst: So, as Rudy says, the water's of no value. <br/>Well...  I drank it. <br/>Probst: Navy SEAL, how wise is that? Is that all right? <br/>Yeah. [ laughing]  Probst: So, is it wise because it's the other tribe? <br/>Yeah. [ laughter]  There you go. [ laughing]  Probst: All right, let's get to your first immunity  challenge. It harkens back to the very first challenge we ever did on  Survivor,"Quest for Fire." Here's how it works. You will each start on floating platforms. On my "go," you will dive down and release your raft  from a mooring on the bottom of the ocean floor. You'll then take the fire torches on your raft and use them to  light a series of woks, making your way back toward the beach. Once you get to the beach, light a third wok. And then you'll drag your raft under a bamboo crawl. First two tribes to light their final wok and cross the finish  line with all six members both win immunity. Now, for the immunity idol. It's two pieces. A human being. Environment. Each piece grants immunity. First two tribes to cross the finish win a piece of the idol. If you hold part of this immunity idol, you cannot go to Tribal  Council, you cannot be voted out of this game. You ready to get this going? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Swim on out, wait for my "go."  Here we go. <br/>Go, guys. <br/>Probst: Richard Hatch just got naked! Survivor: All-Starsis officially on. Survivors, ready? Go! Got to get your raft untied before you can move on. Two clips to untie the raft. Chapera is first out of the block. Moving toward their woks. Mogo Mogo right behind them. Saboga struggling. [ indistinct voices] Chapera and Mogo Mogo-- neck and neck. <br/>Keep going. Yeah, baby! [ grunts]  We're almost there. Pull. <br/>Probst: Chapera working their way over to the first wok. Mogo Mogo heading to their first wok. <br/>You got it, Lex. <br/>We're almost there. <br/>That's okay. <br/>We're almost there. <br/>Go, go! <br/>Probst: Mogo Mogo has their first wok lit. Chapera has their first wok lit. Saboga, still struggling. <br/>Come on, guys, get me over there. <br/>Go, Jenna, go! <br/>Go! [ indistinct voices] [ grunting]  Probst: Saboga has their first wok lit. <br/>You got it, Jenna, you got it. <br/>Come on! <br/>Probst: Mogo Mogo and Chapera still dead even. [ indistinct shouting] Lex, swimming over to light the second  wok for Mogo Mogo. Big Tom lighting the second wok for Chapera. <br/>Come on, Jenna! <br/>Probst: Jenna lights the second wok for Saboga. <br/>Go! <br/>Probst: Saboga, closing the gap. Mogo Mogo first ashore. Chapera right on their tail. <br/>Go, go, push. Push, guys. <br/>Probst: Fatigue starting to set in. Raft is heavy, water tough. Mogo Mogo with the slight lead. [ indistinct voices] Mogo Mogo has their third wok lit. [ indistinct voices] Chapera has their third wok lit. <br/>Okay, Jenna. [ indistinct voices]  Go, go. <br/>Probst: First two tribes to finish win immunity. Everybody and every piece of the raft has to go under the bamboo  crawl. Let's go, Saboga, pick it up. [ shouting] Saboga's closed the gap. They're back in it. <br/>I can't get the fire out! I can't get the fire out! Ethan! <br/>Push! [ indistinct voices]  One, two, three. Push! Go! Go! Go! <br/>Lift! [ grunting and shouting]  Probst: Chapera, the first tribe to win immunity. <br/>Whoo! [ cheering]  Probst: Mogo Mogo not there yet. Mogo Mogo and Saboga still fighting for that second immunity. [ grunting]  Light it! Lex, light it! <br/>Light it! <br/>Pick it up, pick it up. <br/>Probst: Mogo Mogo has their last torch lit. [ grunts] Mogo Mogo wins immunity. [ indistinct shouts]  Whoo! <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Chapera, congratulations. Immunity. No Tribal Council. You're out here three more days. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Mogo Mogo... immunity. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: Safe from Tribal Council. Out here at least three more days. <br/>Mogo! <br/>Mogo Mogo! [ cheering]  Probst: Not a happy group. Tough to lose the first challenge. Tribal Council tomorrow night. One of you six will be the first All-Star voted out. You have tonight and tomorrow to figure out who that's going to  be. You can head back to camp. Chapera, 'cause you crossed first, you get the honor of lighting  up Burning Man. [ cheering]  All right! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Nice job. <br/>Very good job. <br/>We won that. We played as a team. <br/>Team. We have to stay as a team. All right? Never mind what's going on back here. When we had to pull it together and get it done, we got it done. Let's go, Chapera! Let's go! Good job! [ whooping] We're the biggest bunch of misfit survivors you  could put together from seven seasons, and we go out there and win it. Nobody's expecting us to get it done. We are the ultimate underdogs. <br/>Wasn't that the coolest? <br/>That was the best. <br/>We didn't win. We came in first place of the very first All-Star Challenge. <br/>Immunity challenge. <br/>We came back with a good attitude... but we still have no  fire. <br/>Ya! <br/>It's horrible being the first group to Tribal Council,  horrible. None of us came out here to be the first one voted off, but one  of us is going to be the first one voted off. Tonight I think it's important we take out the two winners  first. I don't want to see them get another million dollars. I just want to get rid of them at the beginning. <br/>And I hate to say it, but... it's going to feel good. <br/>It's gonna feel great. <br/>...good, because they don't know what it's like. <br/>No, they don't. Hey, Rupert? <br/>I don't know. <br/>I don't know Rupert well enough to know if I can trust  him. He could be playing a bigger game than I think. Everything's a game. You can't take anything anyone says for what it means. You're a very strong member of the tribe, but you're also a  winner, Ethan. <br/>I know, but that's the... that's your best advantage. <br/>No. It's not. <br/>You got to be silly now to bring a winner to the final  two. <br/>I just don't want you and Tina around, 'cause you're  winners. <br/>You honestly think that? <br/>Yeah. Nobody out here wants to reward another winner. Sorry, guys, it's our game now. Get the hell off our playing field. <br/>Whatever you do, vote for Jenna tonight. We'd have a better chance tonight to vote Jenny... Jenna. I think Ethan and I need to stick together, because if we are  the first two targets, we need to be trying to figure out for ourself, well,  what can we do as targets to stay in the game. What to do, what to do. What's a mother to do? Hopefully, we can pull Rupert in and kind of surprise everybody  tonight. <br/>You got Jerri and tonight. <br/>You got Jerri and Jenna on one side saying, "We got  to get rid of the winners." I got Tina and Ethan on the other side  saying, "You cannot trust Jerri and Jenna. You cannot trust them." I think I might have some control  over Rudy's vote. He and I are going to stick together. [ thunder crashing]  Probst: Welcome to a very wet [ thunder crashing]  Probst: Welcome to a very wet Tribal Council. It's a tree house suspended in the middle of a jungle. A bit of a climb-- not one you're gonna want to make often. Go ahead and grab a torch behind you. Approach the flame. Get fire. Because I know you know by now, fire represents life on the  island and definitely in this game. Once you have fire, put it back in its slot and have a seat. Well, it is the rainy season in Panama, so this could be a sign  of things to come for the next 36 days. How do the first three days out here compare to what you've been  through in the past, Jerri? <br/>It's total hell. [ laughing]  Probst: Rupert, you just barely got home, and you turn  around to come out here and do it again. [ thunder crashing] Sorry you made that decision? <br/>You know, there's a little piece of me that says, why in  the hell did I come back here? I got to think about my wife and my daughter. I did this for Laura and Reya. Maybe I can do better this time. <br/>Probst: I'm noticing that Jerri is literally collecting water  while we sit here and slurping it. <br/>It's bad, Jeff, it's bad. You can live without food, but you cannot live without water,  and we are all feeling it right now, and it's scary. It's really scary. <br/>Probst: Are you trying to collect water in that? <br/>Yeah. It ends up being a spigot. <br/>Probst: Rudy, how does this tribe stack up against Chapera  and Mogo Mogo? <br/>We got a good bunch of people. I'm 75, I ain't what a used to be. I wish I was 23, but I'm not... But these guys are all...  they're good. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about liabilities. Rudy, you mentioned yours-- you're 75-- although you're better  than most 50-year-olds. Ethan, what's a drawback for you? What's gonna hurt you in this game? <br/>I think, um, having won a game before may hurt me. <br/>Probst: Is one of the reasons that being a winner hurts  you is that people respect the fact that you've won this game and therefore  are dangerous? <br/>Definitely, you know? In addition to that, a lot of it's payback time, you know? "You won again. You had your shot."  Probst: Jenna, can you find a scenario in your head that  could include a final two that has a winner and a nonwinner and you want to  vote for the winner? <br/>No. <br/>Probst: Really? <br/>I wouldn't, no. <br/>Probst: You've already decided? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Best player may not win, then, from your point of  view. <br/>No. <br/>Probst: Just based on irritation. <br/>Just based on a million dollars. It's a lot easier for the winners to come back and say they're  here for competition, because they've got a bank account that has $1 million. <br/>Probst: Tina, is that fair? <br/>Of course not, but we all... all the winners who came back  knew that coming in. We all knew that we would have big targets on our chest. <br/>Probst: Rupert, does it matter to you if somebody has won  this game before or not? <br/>You know, I-I like to think I would vote for the best  person out there. <br/>Probst: How about for you, Rudy? <br/>If they can do it again, let them go. <br/>You know, look at any sports team in any league around the  world. Some teams win the championship every year. Should they be knocked out at the beginning of the season 'cause  of the fact that they won the championship that one year? No. <br/>Probst: Okay, it is time to vote. Ethan, you're up. <br/>Jenna, Jenna, Jenna. Ethan, you're up. <br/>Jenna, Jenna, Jenna. Your mouth just keeps going and going and going. But you better be careful, 'cause it might bite you in that big  old butt of yours. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the big old butt of yours. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Probst: Once the votes are votes. <br/>Probst: Once the votes are read, the decision is final,  and the person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Jenna. Jenna. That's two votes Jenna. Tina. One vote Tina. Tina. Two votes Tina, two votes Jenna. That's three votes Tina, two votes Jenna. First person voted out of Survivor: All-Stars... Tina, could you  bring me your torch. Tina, the tribe has spoken. Because you do not yet have fire Tina, the tribe has spoken. Because you do not yet have fire back at the camp, you won't be  taking your torches back with you. They will stay here until you have made fire on your own. You guys can head back. Good night.

Next time on Survivor: Everyone is desperate for water. <br/>Dehydration may be our biggest concern. <br/>These people are like animals gone wild. <br/>Probst: And Ethan tries to prove his worth. <br/>Are you going to see if you could catch fish? <br/>I'm struggling out here. I'm trying to find my niche. <br/>Ethan came up empty-handed. <br/>Rupert goes out. Five minutes later, he comes back with a fish. Great. <br/>No one wants to be the first person voted off, and  especially me, being a competitor, but I was only here three days. And was it a hard three days? Absolutely. This experience has been different for me, because I went in on  an equal playing ground the first time, so, you know, I kind of expected it,  but it doesn't make it any easier.
