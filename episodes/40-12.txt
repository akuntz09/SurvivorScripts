<br/>Ben: Wow, big move, Tony. Well played, sir. Tony: It was-- it  was-- it was a last-minute thing, man. -ben: Yeah? -yeah. Jeremy: Tribal council  was crazy. Ben tried to make a  move on me, but Sophie went to the edge. So there's hard  feelings. Ben is pissed. He's not even talking  to me. It's so crazy. He's such a child. Like, grow up, Ben. Come on, man. The game goes up and  down. Just chill out and  let's play. You guys had us duped. You want to go talk, Sarah? Sarah: This was Tony's  idiotic move. But I told myself,  "Sarah, just keep your cool and don't be pissed." -you just sunk my  game. -no. -i'm done. Those guys don't want  to work with me. -yo. -it's me that flipped,  not you. You didn't flip. I did. -oh-- okay-- -i wrote Michele's  name down. -i know. That's fine... -Jeremy  don't want to work with me. -that's fine. -you don't need them. I'm with you. I'm... -[scoffs] -i  swear. I swear. -you're not with me. Sarah: To have Tony  come up with this all alone, I’m absolutely infuriated with him. It's ridiculous. It's a $2 million  game. What are you doing,  dude? We were fine. And now do we even  have the numbers? You think we do, but  you don't know if we do. I have an idol and I can  pay up fine. -i understand that. -you're not going  anywhere, Sarah. -all right. -if I jeopardize  anybody's game, it's mine. I swear to my family,  I didn't want to blindside you. -i'll tell you this  right now. -yeah. I will let all of this  go... -under what condition? -...until it sinks me. -aw, man. -then it's not gone. -yeah. -i get voted out, -do  not talk to me ever again. -no, come on. Tony: Wow, man. Usually, you blindside  somebody, you go back to camp, you hash it all out, and everybody's like,  "it's okay. It's all good."  not this time. This time, it's like  deep wounds, man. But, come on, give me  a break. I'm playing the game,  too, you know? This is war. Stop crying. Put your man panties  on and go to war. I am with you 100%. It was just tonight,  -and I wanted to make that move. -okay. And I promise to you,  I did not want to hurt you -or go with that side. -right. And I’m gonna tell you  something. I have an idol. Okay? -you have one? -i have an idol. -where'd you... -i  found it on the rock. -really? -yeah. So, I’m telling you  the truth, guys. I want to go to the  end with you guys. Ben: Tony's telling me  about all his advantages and all his idols, so he's gaining trust. But I don't know if I trust  him, because he's blindsided me hugely. -the reason why I’m so  upset... -yeah. ...is because Jeremy's  still here. -and because i'm...  -[splat] -ooh. -what the ... Is that? -you just got ... On. -by what? -a bird. A-- what bird is in  the nighttime? -[laughs] -ben: I still  want Jeremy out next. A] he is a challenge  beast, right? And b] he is a jury  threat. He's gonna get all the  votes. Like, there's just no  way for me to work with Jeremy, so I am not talking to Jeremy right now, and  I don't want to talk with Jeremy right now. -are you sure that's a  bird? -i'm po-- where else--  or bat. -a bat? -[laughs]: Yes, dude. Tony: Is that good or  bad? Ben: That's some  karma. Tony: Oh, my God. [crickets  chirping]  Tony: I made a big power move, which was blindsiding Sophie. The backlash was  unbelievable, so I think I’m in trouble. My wife told me,  "Tony, this time you can't play wild. You can't play crazy. You can't play  flashy." but I got the itch, and now this is the time for another  undercover operation. In my first season,  season 28 incagayan, I made a spy shack, and it worked. You know, he lied to  my face. Tony: And then,game  changers, my second season, I made the underground bunker. It was a failure, but  it was fun. Right now, my spying  has evolved, and now I’m up in the air. It's called the spy  nest. It's like a bird nest  that I perch myself on, just like a bird, and I sit there and I wait to hear  conversations that are going on. The only person that  knows I’m undercover is my partner, Sarah. It's only me, and  nobody's coming. No, I can't see you at  all, dude. It's... Golden. If we were in the real  world and Tony and I were partners, one of us would be fired, okay? Tony's back to the old  Tony, and it's nonstop-- go, go, go. And he doesn't let up. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. -yeah. Okay. -all right. Sarah: He's got my  back and I got his back and we're not gonna turn on each other. But if he's not  willing to back off a little, then he's gonna get himself voted out. How are you today? How'd you sleep, Ben? -what's that? -how'd you sleep? It was all right. Jeremy: You want to  talk? No. -no? -nah. -i don't. -why not? 'Cause I said no. That's all. I just don't want to. [chuckling] -never  seen anything like it. -yeah. Kim: Last night was  emotional and a little bit crazy. And it's super clear  people are thinking Jeremy's gonna go next. But hell no. I mean, I’m not doing  that. For me, it's really  obvious that Tony and Sarah are a problem right now. But I still have a  relationship with Sarah that can be salvaged. I'd so much rather see  Tony go than Sarah. And I’m done with the  sitting around, hoping that I’m on the right side of the votes. -this is where I’m at. -we have to-- okay. -Tony has to go. -he has to. Yeah. Right. Wow. I think you're right. Yeah. -what are we gonna do? -yeah, exactly. -sit and wait? -yeah. -just get picked off eventually. -uh-huh. Kim: This is by far  the riskiest move i've ever had to make, but I have to do something. I mean, I have to turn  this around or go out trying. To me, this is the  point where you flip the light switch on -and go, "okay, here we  go." -mm-hmm. -like, and then hope  you make it. -yeah. Amen. I agree. -i'm 100% with you...  -i'm 100% in with you. Michele: Tony has been  running the show, and we've been left out of the loop. We've been made fools  of. And I think a lot of  us are feeling that way right now. I... Agree. Michele: This game is  about power. And this seems like a  perfect opportunity to gain a little bit of control in this game and take out  Tony.  Sophie: Ooh,  boy. -Amber: What you got  there? -Parvati: What is  this? -what you got there,  Rob? -rob: All right, you  ready? -yeah. -[oohing] -yay! -Yul: Oh, no! -[groaning] oh, my God. I don't want to do a  tremendous effort challenge. Natalie: Oh. [Tyson groans]   here we go! Just a nice marathon  pace, guys. Rob: The mad dash was  on. Out of everybody here,  I think I’m pretty physical. I feel like I have an  edge in this challenge. Danni: I knew  this challenge is gonna really, really suck. It's gonna be a  marathon, just like the log challenge was. And so I knew I wanted  to pace myself. Rob: I got out to the  lead the first couple laps. It was probably not a  good idea if I’m setting the pace. I should probably slow  down and let somebody else take the lead. Parvati: The  stakes are really high for this challenge. Only six people are  gonna be able to win tokens. This is pretty stiff  competition. Wendell's really  strong. Tyson's an endurance  athlete. Yul's really strong. Natalie is a  superhero. Tyson: It was  more brutal than I expected it to be. And when I see how  fast these girls are going, I’m thinking, "i can't, even if I wanted to,  keep up with them." [panting]  Adam: This does not suit my  strengths. Like, I have never,  ever been a good runner. People are passing me  left and right. I'm in last place  already. What the hell? Did you really just do  that? What the hell? How did he do that? Oh, my God. Ethan: It was  incredibly difficult, and the tide started coming in. And then your feet are  ankle-high in-in ocean water. [groans]   [shouts] -[screams] -Adam: Oh, my God. I slipped and fell and  cracked my elbow. I just felt it. Like, I tried to shake  it off, but, like... ...i knew I was done. That was it for me. I was toast. Tyson: Natalie and Sophie  lapped every single other person at least twice. Sophie: I was back and  forth with Natalie the whole challenge. And Natalie's a beast. But I just kept  running the whole time. Natalie: Sophie was in  the lead for a majority of the time, but I knew that I had a little bit more  in the tank. I just pushed and I was  like, "why not beat her?" and I beat her. [chuckles] that was  fun. Oh, my God. [scoffs] -there's four  more spots. -[exhales] -Tyson. -Yul. -Yul's next. -Yul. -Natalie: Tyson. Parv. -Tyson. Never thought i'd be  so happy to leave -a pile of coconuts behind. -[groans] Natalie: Let's  go, guys! This is your last  push! -Sophie: Yes, Yul. Good work. -yeah, Yul! Yul: To my big  surprise, I ended up in third place. [whooping] -you did  it! -did it. I am so elated that I finished,  and I finished with Tyson, an ultra-endurance professional athlete. I was like,  "yeah! I still got it."  -everything hurts. -[Tyson groans] Wendell? Or is Danni-- -i can't  tell if Danni's in it. -Danni's good. -is she in it? -she's endurance  queen. Sophie: I feel like  it'll come down to Danni and Wendell. Natalie: Yeah. Sophie: Seven. Danni: Once I got to  those final coconuts, I’m like, "okay, here I am. Pick up the pace. "you've got to  fight. "you're further  out than you thought you were. "go for it. You've got to go for  it to get those tokens." Wendell: I knew Danni was the next person  behind me. She was in seventh  place. I was in sixth place. And then she was  gaining on me. Danni: I just kept  running and picking up the pace and thought I could catch Wendell, and I started  to close the gap on him. [gasps] yeah. Yeah. Unfortunately, I started  out way too slow and just couldn't gain enough ground. And I finished  seventh, just one short of winning two fire tokens. Rob: I said I wasn't gonna care if I didn't  win, you know? But I do. Wendell: Yeah. Rob: I feel like it  was important for me to finish. I didn't want to feel  like I was quitting. That's what makes this  game so good, is that it is so hard. Amber: It was hard to  see him still going to get those coconuts well after it was finished. That shows you that  he's not a quitter and that... [sniffles] he's gonna keep on fighting. Jeremy: I don't  get it. Yeah. -me and Ben were like  this. -yeah. -he called me his  ride-or-die. -yeah. It's a mess right now. Your game is not over,  right? My game is not over. Put yourself in my  shoes and you would be going, "what did you do?" Nick: The more  people are fighting, the more there is a war, the more crossfire and friendly  fire going on, the more I can really crank it up. Now is the time to  start trying to figure out who I want to sit at the end with and finding a  way to get everybody else out. We need a tight three. -just three? -like, at the e--  like... -i think so. -yeah. Yeah. -i would love that. -three of us working  with... -Kim. It's possibly tight,  four. -Michele: Four. -Nick: Yeah. -Denise: And I don't  know that anyone would totally expect that either. -i would be so down  with that. -mm-hmm. Nick: I’m done just  making it one step farther. I got my eye on the  prize at this point, and that's why I have to make big moves. I have to do something  to stand out. It's nice when you can  get with a group of people that you mutually Benefit each other. -can run with the  numbers for once. -yeah. Right. -for once. -or two. Aiming for one. [whispers]: I know. Nick: In my opinion,  there's three people in this game still that certainly beat me at the end, at  least three. That's Jeremy, Sarah  and Tony. We'll have to get rid  of 'em. -Tony, we're in  trouble now. -okay. Now we don't know  where an idol's at. -so-so... -and one of  them gets an idol -and I get voted out, I am not gonna be happy. -right. Sophie's idol is gonna  get put back in play. We've got to find it. Sarah: Sophie  went out with an idol. So now it's gonna be  out here. I need to save myself. If I don't find it, if  Tony doesn't find it, we could be in hot water. Denise: There's been a  mad dash already, and there's a lot of hands out here digging. There may be another  hidden immunity idol in the mix, which complicates everything all over again. Everybody's looking  through the dirt and the cobwebs and digging around trees. We really want to get Tony  out. So we need to get the  hidden immunity idol before Tony so that he doesn't have something else up  his sleeve. Ben: Kim is, like,  ready to make a move now. -she doesn't want to  be blindsided anymore. -yeah. So what kind of move  you think she's trying to make? -trying to get in with  Jeremy? -well, trying to...  -probably, yeah. Yeah. -yeah, right? Yeah, yeah. -Jeremy and Michele. -yeah. And Nick, too, I’m assuming. Tony: No, Nick, I trust  him 100%. Ben: 'kay. Well, she's just--  she's just ready to play her game. You know what I mean? She's just ready. See that? You see that? You see that? You see that? [grunting] well...  Tony: I saw him try to sneak it from me. Hello? Ben? I'm right next to you,  man. What are you doing? I-i'm watching you try  to hide the idol. Ben: I found the idol. And the first reaction  is, "oh. Oh, no. Got to turn it around. Don't let anybody  see." and then Tony's standing right there. He's like, "come  on, Ben." you found the idol in front of me. You're trying to hide  it in front of me, man. Y-- are you okay? All right, I found it. You know? He's like, "why  did you do that to me, man? You got to trust me. I'm sorry. I-i'm really-- -i'm  sorry for that moment. -it's okay, Ben. It's okay. It's okay. I got caught  red-handed. Gold-handed, right? Tony: But you still  don't trust me, man? Ben: Well, now you--  we trust each other. -Tony, listen, we're  in lockstep now. -i know. I just got nervous -when  you were trying to hide it from me, man. -well... -come on. -you-- look at what  you did to me. Yeah, but that's over  though. I thought we were  okay. -i know. But it's, like, four  hours later, dude. -all right. What am I supposed to  do? -"Tony,  look." -'kay. Ben: You know, I was  trying to hide it from Tony, right? Because I barely trust  Tony right now. -good job, man. -listen, -we're good,  'kay? -so now-- so now we're  good. -don't start getting  paranoid. -i'm-- no, I’m not  paranoid. Ben: Kim wants to take  out Tony, but Tony has an idol. So I need him to be  comfortable. -we have control in  this game. As long as... -thank  goodness. Yeah. So it doesn't matter. We can start picking  'em off. Here we go. He thinks he has me in  his pocket, and that's perfect, because I need to figure out what route I’m gonna  take-- whether or not to go with Kim and start targeting Tony... No, no,  you're good, man. ...or if I can work  with the guy, right? Oh, my God. Tony, I can't believe  it. [grunts] no. No-no, seriously,  stop. come on in,  guys! [groans] all right,  let's get to today's immunity challenge. First things first, Tony. Thank you. Once again, immunity  is back up for grabs. For today's challenge,  you're gonna stand on a very narrow perch with your hand above you, tethered  to a bucket. When your hand drops,  you're out of the challenge. Last person left  standing wins immunity. And today it will be  the last woman... And the last man. -ooh. -both will win  immunity. Both will earn two  fire tokens. Big stakes in this  game. Take your spots. We'll get started. all right,  everybody's in position, with their arms above. Now you have to take  your hand off the structure in three, two, one. And this challenge is  on. first time we  did this challenge was season three. In its original  version, it went -six hours. -[scoffs] then we  modified it. We added that beam  you're standing on, which made it a lot more difficult. That went an hour. And now we have made  it even more difficult. We've removed your  ability to support that arm that is tethered to the bucket with your other  hand. The most difficult  version yet. Let's see how long  this one goes. -been up there  five minutes. -[exhales] you gonna  offer us food, Jeff? Not this early. Got to earn it a  little bit, Ben. Tony: It's really not  that early, Jeff. I mean, I feel my  shoulder's -on fire already. [chuckles] -what is it  -you would love, Ben? -peanut butter -and  cookies, Jeff. -of course. Just to get down off  this. I'm in pain, Jeff. [creaking] [jangling] Jeremy  drops. -and Ben touched the  structure. -[scoffs] -did you  touch it? -yes, Jeff, I touched  it. Ben, I’m sorry. You're out. Ben is out. Cannot touch the  structure. We're down to two guys  left. -sorry, Ben, but  thanks for the integrity. -yes, sir. Probst: Sarah drops. It is now Denise, Kim  and Michele competing for one immunity. Nick and Tony  competing for the other. You can feel the  intensity kick in right now. Toughest version of  this challenge we've done. And you're seeing why. I'm gonna try to go  for three in a row, Nick, man. -you are? -record-break-- yeah,  record-breaking, man. -i'm sorry. -okay. I'm gonna do my best,  too, all right? Yeah, yeah. I got you, Nick. We're good. Probst: Given how  crazy tribal has been, one after another after another stunning blindsides,  having that necklace, as Tony knows from the previous two tribal councils, is  a great feeling. been up there 15  minutes. Now I’m gonna try to  tempt you to come down with some food. [groans] -Jeff. -damn it. -oh, my gosh. -ben, I promise you,  this was coming out at 15 minutes no matter who was up there. There's a mound of  peanut butter with chocolate. Cookies and milk. Exactly what Ben had  asked for. Damn, do you see all  that? -yeah. -probst: If you want  to opt out now, this will be yours. If more than one of  you, you will share it. And you will eat until  the challenge is over. Yep, I’m gonna do it. Kim's gonna step out. Anybody gonna join  her? The window is closing. All right, i'll do it. Probst: Michele's out,  which means Denise wins. -Tony: Yes. -Nick: You'll give me  -one token? I'll do it. -yes. Yes. -i'll do it. -probst: Nick is  dropping, which means Tony wins. Insane. -take it. -Denise: Wait. I got it. I got it? -i got it? -probst: You got it, Denise. -... Yeah! [whoops] -probst: Just  take this. Hold it? I can't eat it if I hold  it. Wow! What an ending. -Tony, you're good. -can I eat, too? You cannot eat. You just won immunity,  brother. We're done, man. Can you come and help  me out so I don't get wet? Probst: One of the  craziest finishes in any Survivorchallenge. [groans] probst: How  fast security in this game went out the window for chocolate, peanut butter,  cookies and milk. Denise, come on over. -[exhales] thank you. -Nick: Wow. Individual immunity is  yours. Safe tonight at tribal  council. Cannot be voted out of  this game. In addition, two fire  tokens are yours. -you are safe. Congrats. -Denise: Thank you. -thanks. -probst: Tony, come on  over. -three times in a row. -wow. -[whoops] -you went  from nothing... -i know. Thank you. -...to a streak. -thank you so much. -Tony once again safe  in this game. -thank you. Probst: Cannot be  voted out. -two fire tokens for  you. -thank you, sir. Probst: As for the  rest of you, tribal council tonight, where one of you will be voted out, sent  to the Edge of Extinction. Grab your stuff, head  back to camp. See you tonight at  tribal. -congrats. -thank you, Jeff. Thank you. Tony: What?! I won three in a row. Back-to-back-to-back. It's amazing, 'cause  anything can happen. I could've sneezed at  that moment. Mosquito could've bit  me in the eyeball. So, thanks, Nick. One token for an  immunity necklace? I'll take it. That's a bargain. [bird squawking]  [Tony whoops] -[whoops] -yeah. Jeremy: Congratulations,  Denise. They had to give cookies  and milk away -so Tony could win. -[Nick laughs] Kim: The  immunity challenge was a son of a "b." my plan has been majorly  foiled to blindside Tony tonight. -can you try to win a  damn immunity? -[laughs] I’m kind of  winning all the time. -[laughs] right. -ow, man. Yo, you got heavy  hands, man. Yo. -that hurt? -yeah, that hurt. [laughs]: No, it  didn't. Kim: I’m so mad that  he's won three immunities in a row. He has tons of fire  tokens. He's driving me crazy  in the game. Ben: Right. Right. Nick: And then it hit  me. -i was like, "oh,  crap." -Kim: No, I know. That's got to go on  the back burner, so what's going on the front burner? Nick: After last  night, I want -to prove my loyalty to Ben. -Kim: Okay. Nick: I will vote Jeremy  tonight. -okay. Yeah? -ben: Yeah. Yeah. -Denise: Yes. -Nick: I know that you  guys -have been going at it. -Michele: Wait, Ben. -ben: Yes. Mm-hmm. -Denise: Yep. Nick: We'll have to  put our plan on the back burner. I tried to do my best  to win that immunity challenge, and I was falling off. At least I get one of Tony's  fire tokens, peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies. And Jeremy goes home,  anyways, and there's no harm. So I think it's a  win-win. Like, I can't help but  just be, like, sad that it would be Jeremy. Yeah. Well, i'm... I really  do think you, me, Nick and Denise -could be a thing. -same. Michele: I am  distraught. I've been close with Jeremy  since day one in this game. He's kind of been,  like, my true family out here. But I don't know how  we get out of this pickle. Ben: Okay. -so, they're all  voting Jeremy tonight. -mm-hmm. -you... But you won  immunity. -yeah. So they can't do that  now. Yeah, yeah. You heard them say  "Tony," though? Who's they? Tony: Oh, Kim is. Tony: I just found  this news out. Kim was chirping in  everybody's ear, "maybe it's Tony's time to go." and it's a big  deal to me. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Oh. Oh, uh... Trying to  remember. Uh... [exhales] Tony:  I’m talking to Nick, and he's looking at me, and he's fumbling his words. I keep asking him,  "Nick, what's going on?" he's always lost. Like, come on, man. Nick is lying to me  right in my face. Are they really trying  to get me out, you think? -she just mentioned it  to me. -who's she? -Kim. Yeah, yeah. -oh, Kim said it? But... Okay. Okay. -oh. -[laughs] -here you  go. Yeah, yeah. -thanks for doing  that, man. So, now I’m 100%  worried about Kim trying to get these lower-tier threats together. So, if Jeremy goes  home, we're screwed, 'cause the ladies are gonna stick together and possibly  use Nick. Sarah: So, at this  point, we're writing Jeremy down. At this point, we-we  might have to work with Jeremy, man. No, but we can't piss  Ben off. Well, this is what  happened. Ben told me that the  girls were talking about me this morning, a-and Nick didn't even come -tell  me that. -Sarah: Mm-hmm. -see? 'Cause he ain't with  us. -Tony: And he was. Okay. -he told Tony about...  -no. -yeah. And-and... -no. -damn it. -yeah. -[groans] that's so  frustrating. -i know, it sucks. When I heard it... If Kim  stays in the game and Jeremy goes, next vote, Nick goes with the girls. -and it's done. It's done. We are done. -i-i think... But we  got to vote out Jeremy because we got to try and preserve Ben as our number  because we don't have any other option. I don't think... I-i  think Ben is gonna destroy our game -if we're scared of what to do. -i know. Okay, so you got to  talk to Ben, then. Ben: Hey. -we're good, right? -i'm good with you. -okay. -right? Now, now, now, Ben,  you're-you're 100% on Jeremy? -yes. Right? -okay, okay. No, i-i was thinking  if-if there was any way I could beg you or pay you, even, a fire token if you  could just hear me out with the Kim thing. -yes. Okay. -okay. We get rid of Jeremy  tonight, Kim is gonna get Michele, Denise. -they're gonna get Nick. Nick just... -no. I just talked to Nick  right now. He's playing me like a  fiddle. -he's lying to me. -Nick made his bed  with you today. Right? He gave you immunity. He didn't give it to  me. He was falling off the  challenge. He can go to the end  with Kim. -that's what he wants  to do. -well, that's...  [grunts] -what he thought. -that's what he wants  to do. So, once-once Jeremy's  gone, they're coming after us. They have the numbers. Me, you, Sarah. Ping, ping, ping. Gone. And then we... Hey, listen. The-the soldier and  the two cops and the fireman -will stick together and get rid of these little  rats. -right. I don't think Nick's  gonna do that. I don't honestly think  so. -i mean, i... -please,  bro. Jeremy is the number  one horse to win this frickin' game. We can get him out...  Get her out next time. Okay. -we can't. -okay. Do you think it's on  you or me? You, I think. If I give the  advantage to you, then you play it for yourself, -and if it doesn't work,  then doesn't work. -[groans] Michele: Everybody  is voting Jeremy, and I don't think that I can shift the tides and save him. I have to write Jeremy's  name down, but it doesn't mean that I can't try to throw him a bone to help  him out. -word? -Kim's got to go, bro. And we don't have...  And we can't trust... Oh. So, who are you voting  for? Michele was gonna give  me something. Okay. I want to talk to you  about -us moving forward. -right. Like, I don't want to  butt heads with you no more. -like, I feel like we  need each other. -right. So, who would you take  out, then? I mean, we can go  after Kim. -yeah. -listen, I’m trying to  build trust -back with you. I'm trying to give you  a little bit. -i know. -i know. -all right? Jeremy: He can't even  talk to me. And I could still see  him, like, stewing. Like, okay. What do I do now? Something's going on. I don't know. I don't know. I can't even figure it  out. All right, play it  tonight. Let me have it. Let me have it. Let me have it. Let me have it. Oh, my God. Jeremy: I don't feel  in control of my game. I have the 50/50 idol  in my pocket. If all else fails, I can  use that. But it could be an  idol, it could be nothing. It's a flip of the  coin. I might not be coming  back to camp tonight. Starting to get  paranoid. This is... This is not  good. This is the part of  the war that's gonna get really ugly. This is gonna be more  like friendly fire. probst: So, Denise,  last tribal council, it was really calm. And then the vote  happened, and I’m guessing when you went back to camp, -it wasn't as calm. -Denise: Oh, yeah. It was like watching  bad family therapy. Fighting, yelling,  betrayal, anger, hurt. It was mass chaos. Kim, is it one of  those situations where, in the heat of the moment, people might have been  willing to say something, but once a new day begins, you go, "okay,  maybe we all need to calm down"? Kim: Absolutely. Everything changes  almost every day. The person that was on  the bottom yesterday can be the one calling the shots today. I think if you can  make it through another day, -it's like a clean slate in a lot of ways. -Tony: Jeff, it's  shifting a lot faster than day by day. I think it's shifting  minute by minute, hour by hour, much more fluidly than -day by day. -Jeremy: Jeff, we're  running on an endless treadmill. -[laughs] -no matter  what time you put on that thing, it's exhausting. Probst: Michele, let's  talk about today's challenge. Kim, yourself and Nick  all dropped out for peanut butter and chocolate. Denise and Tony win  immunity. What happens in that  moment? It can't simply be,  "i'm just really hungry." Michele: No. And me and Kim were  just torn up with regret. We didn't feel  confident that we could last any longer. But then when you step  down, you're like, "well, what if somebody makes a mistake the next  minute, and now we just stepped down?" so, every decision that you make,  of course you're riddled with regret and anxiety. -probst: Kim, agree  with that? -Kim: Yeah. I mean, the truth is I  completely regret it. I felt like my bucket  was tipping, and so I heard myself say, "i'm coming down." at this  moment, I would so much rather have fallen two seconds and not gotten the  peanut butter than have stepped down, and then I know for sure that it wasn't  falling. -probst: Nick, how  about for you? -well, Tony gave me a  fire token to step down, so I feel like I got the food temptation and then  also the fire token temptation. But... I mean,  stepping down from a challenge... Probst: I got to interrupt. Is this so common that  you can actually answer my question while it's still going on? Nick: I guess it's...  Yeah, I think it's becoming common. I mean, I thought  everybody was on the same page. And this is an  argument to not step down no matter how confident you are in your place in  the game and how much you trust your allies, because it can... Change like  that, even at tribal. Denise, everything was  going just fine. Oh, my God. We cannot even get  through one tribal council and just freaking focus. It's like a tribe of  crazy, paranoid players, and it's driving us nuts. Probst: And we're  ringside. They're coming around  the first turn. [laughter] they're all  up. Except for Sarah,  still seated. Ben in the middle,  seated. Tony and Jeremy  talking. Kim. Okay. Okay. I don't. -probst: Sarah, is  there a... -what? -[laughs] -sorry. -Sarah: What was that,  Jeff? -[laughs] is there a  point when you just say, "i can't have any more conversations; if it's  me, then it's me"? I would say i'm, like,  at my peak at this point. I mean, it is just  mentally and emotionally exhausting. I mean, this is ridiculous. And you have people on  the Edge of Extinction -who are losing their mind in a different way. -Sarah: Right. Uh, here's the thing. They sit there and  would give anything to be us, and we would like to be able to shut off. It's the price you  pay. I mean, I don't want  to trade seats with anyone, but I’m definitely not enjoying sitting in this  seat very much. Maybe we just wait  till you're done and we vote. Maybe there's nothing  to be said tonight. Right? -i'm done. -you're done with  what? I'm ready to vote. I'm seriously like...  -are you-you... You sure you want to do that? -yeah. Jeremy: You know  you're just -safe tonight, though, right? -i-i... -you sure you  want to do that? -i fully realize that. -okay. Okay. -i've got it. probst: Wow. Everybody sitting. Should we vote? Yep. Probst: All right, it  is time to vote. Jeremy, you're up. I hope you put my 50/50 coin to good use. I'll go tally the  votes. if anybody has a  hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so. Just give me one  minute, Jeff. Sarah, you feel good? How do you feel? -hey, Jeff, I’m just  gonna... I'm-a play it. -well... I'm-a play  for Sarah. Sarah: No, wait. -Tony, you don't have  to. -yeah. -you sure? -Sarah: Yeah. So no play? -no play. No, no. -probst: Nothing? -i'm-a do it. -yeah. I'm-a do it. [exclaims] Tony: If  you didn't do that, man, then play it. If you... If you gave  me your word... -go. -wait, wait. -are you sure? -yes! -go. -Tony: Okay. Okay. -probst: We're good? -Tony: Yeah. Probst: All right. I'll read the votes. First vote: Jeremy. Kim. Jeremy. Two votes Jeremy, one  vote Kim. Jeremy. -three votes Jeremy. -damn it. Kim. That's three votes Jeremy,  two votes Kim. Kim. We're tied. Three votes Jeremy,  three votes Kim. Kim. Four votes Kim, three  votes Jeremy, one vote left. 14th person voted out:  Kim. Need to bring me your  torch. Kim, -the tribe  has spoken. -thanks, Jeff. Probst: Time for you  to go. Kim: Sheesh.

Probst: Next time on a  two-hour episode ofSurvivor... -it's like a bomb goes off. -Danni's going for it. Yes. -he doesn't want to go  to the end with us. -i know that. Tony and I are sitting  ducks. Ben: This right now in  this war is the hardest mission yet. Kim: The feeling of  being voted out was weird, but I’m not sorry for trying to gather the troops  to take out Tony. I think it was the  right move, and the game's not over. -Kim. -hi. [groans] I won't step  down for peanut butter on the battle back. -i want a hug. -hi. Do you have peanut  butter breath? -can I smell your  breath? -long time no see.
