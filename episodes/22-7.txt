<br/>Episode 7 -  <br/>Jeff: previously on "Survivor": Third person  voted out of "Survivor: Redemption Island," Russell. For the Zapatera tribe the one night of pleasure they got from  throwing a challenge to get rid of Russell turned into days of misery. Tribe unity crumbled. <br/>David under pressure is really stressful. <br/>I don't freak out. <br/>Jeff: And David's relationship with Sarita got so bad he  joined forces with Stephanie to try to vote Sarita out. <br/>Stephanie is a capable competitor in the challenges and I  think unquestionably Sarita is the weakest player on the tribe. <br/>Jeff: At Ometepe, Rob had a hidden immunity idol in his  pocket along with most of his tribe. <br/>By me having this I know that nobody else has this. <br/>Jeff: But Phillip had a love-hate relationship with Rob. <br/>I have been in an alliance with Rob, Grant, and myself. <br/>Jeff: when Rob tried to hide a clue to a hidden immunity  idol  I saw it. <br/>Jeff: It was all-out war. <br/>I'm going to kick a little ass around here. <br/>Jeff: Natalie goes short! Ometepe wins immunity! The Ometepes won their third out of the last four challenges. The Zapateras went to tribal council where dave and Stephanie  voted for Sarita but everyone else voted for Stephanie. Stephanie, the tribe has spoken. With Stephanie off to a duel, both tribes are now even at six. Well, you made the decision to go with somebody you think you  can trust versus keeping somebody who might have done better at challenges. We'll know soon enough if you made the right call. <br/>I hope we can all come together. <br/>I know David and Sarita have had some differences, but I  hope you guys can...  The two votes against Sarita were Stephanie and mine. I didn't want to make any bones about where I stood. I did what I had to do and I wanted to make my place and my  position known, and if it's the end of me, then so be it. <br/>I look forward to moving forward, and all pitching in like  we're all doing around camp. <br/>Me, too, me, too. And I do love constructive feedback and I do need to buck up  more. Tribal is never good but tonight was especially bad because come  to find out our gang of six did have a major hole in it, which as I had  suspected, David had gone over to the dark side, to Stephanie. <br/>Well, let's do the best we can to function as a tribe  because it's in all our collective best interests. <br/>I agree. <br/>This is the six we've wanted back in day one, but there's  a big rift between David and Sarita. <br/>Find common ground like we did back in day two and three. <br/>I agree. And I have a ton of respect for you, David. <br/>You don't need to give me a speech. It doesn't Matter. <br/>Dave is showing he can be a bit of an antagonist but  hopefully David can be man enough and put his ego and pride and emotions  aside and, you know, for the bigger cause of the team. If not, there could be pRoblems. <br/>I mean, there are so many things I love, I love vietnamese  food, thai food, I like chinese food, I love italian. I don't even like sweets but bring it on and I'm going to have a  slice of red velvet from a bakery I used to work at. The weirdest thing I've been craving is a banana shake with peanut  butter in it. Like I want the taste of peanut butter like snicker doodles with  peanut butter on top and milk. <br/>You're killing me, smalls. Stephanie came in and her mouth was going a mile a minute and it  was kind of annoying. I'm ready to go to the duel right now. I really want to win this one. I told god I'm going to be out here as long as he wants me to be  out here so I'm in it for the long haul. <br/>Tree mail! "Here you go again. By now, you know what to do. Select your redemption visitors and again, only choose  two." who's going? <br/>I'm going to go. If that's okay. Because it's my turn again. <br/>Can I go with you, Phillip? <br/>Sure. <br/>So Rob and Phillip. <br/>There's another duel. Rob and I are going to go. I just don't trust Rob anymore because yesterday Rob and Grant  found a clue to an idol and I went and I followed them. And when Rob saw me he tried to hide it. Miyamoto musashi a very famous japanese horse man once wrote a  book called "The book of five rings." and in the book he said what  you want to do which is so difficult is let your enemy move first, and that's  where Rob's weakness is. He likes to be extremely controlling, and he wants to control  me. And all the other players. But nobody's controlling me. <br/>You've got to bring your shirt. <br/>I do? <br/>Phillip wanted to go to the duel. He's not allowed to go without a chaperone so I have to baby sit  his ass for the day. Phillip has a big mouth. He likes to talk and he can't be trusted. He's dangerous because of his stupidity. He's pRobably the most unaware person I've ever met in my entire  life. <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the competitors for today's duel. Matt will be battling against Stephanie, voted out at the last  tribal council. Welcome to Redemption Island arena. Both tribes have sent members to witness today's duel. Matt, you spent 12 nights on Redemption Island. You've won four duels. Once again you find yourself in a do-or-die situation. Ready to get to it? <br/>Yes. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: One of the most difficult aspects of the game of  "Survivor" is mental fatigue. Conveniently, today's duel will test your memory. <br/>Perfect! <br/>Jeff: Scattered in the arena are pairs of matching  symbols. Each round you'll flip over two symbols. If they match, you score a point. First to five stays alive, loser is out of the game for good. This is it. One shot. Take your spots. All right, Stephanie won the rock, paper, scissor. She has elected to have Matt go first. You're flipping over two symbols. First round is going to take some luck to get a match. Matt flips over a skull... And another skull. <br/>Oh, god! <br/>Jeff: wow! <br/>Golden boy! <br/>Jeff: Unreal. Walk out onto the course and flip over two random symbols and  they match. Matt takes an early one-zip lead. Stephanie, you're up. Stephanie looking for the same kind of luck. Flips over a crocodile. <br/>Wow! <br/>Jeff: And a crocodile. <br/>Nice! <br/>Jeff: Redemption Island got something going on out here. It is 1-1. Matt is now back on the course. Matt flips over a calendar. And an eagle. No match. Stephanie, your turn. Stephanie flips over war clubs. And fire. We are still tied 1-1. Matt, you're up. Matt flips over fire. Has it already been turned over? And if so, can he remember where? Matt flips over a second fire symbol. Matt now in the lead 2-1. Stephanie, you're up. Stephanie flips over a warrior. <br/>All right. Temple. <br/>Jeff: And a temple. No match for Stephanie. Door open for Matt to take a bigger lead. Matt flips over the eagle. Going to take a shot. Matt flips over another eagle. Matt now has three to Stephanie's one. We are playing to five. <br/>Oh. <br/>Jeff: Stephanie flips a temple. She knows she's seen one. Where was it? Nice match for Stephanie. Matt leads 3-2. Matt, you're up. Matt flips over one canoe, looking for a second canoe. And he has it. Matt with now a very big lead. Matt has 4, Stephanie has 2. It takes five to win. Stephanie's got to get a match here. <br/>Warrior. Where were you? Oh, my god. <br/>Jeff: And she does. Stephanie with her third match. Keeps herself in this. <br/>I'm losing my mind! <br/>Jeff: Matt has 4, Stephanie has 3. It takes 5 to win. Matt could do it right here. Matt with a calendar. Have we seen a calendar? <br/>Yes, we have. <br/>Jeff: Matt thought he had it. He flips the head dress. No match. Door open for Stephanie now. Stephanie quickly flips the calendar. And thought she had it. Got the war clubs instead. Matt very excited now. You can win the duel right here. Matt flips over one war club. And Matt flips over the second war club. For the fifth time Matt stays alive, will live to see another  day in this game. [ applause ] Stephanie, what's the emotional feeling right now  when you want to play so badly and now you are out? <br/>Just leaving altogether because I really wanted to be here  until the end so just letting go of that dream sucks. I feel like there are people here who don't deserve to be here. Sarita is one of them. Ralph, if you really want to play the game, you need to get rid  of her soon because she's your weakest link. And I know you think dave is because he voted with me for Sarita  but he's the only guy who can do puzzles. Do you want to take on that responsibility? <br/>If I got to do it, I will. <br/>Jeff: Rob and Phillip are you tempted to say anything to  them or are they on their own? <br/>I don't know. Rob, look out because they're going to try to take you out like  they took out Russell so watch your back and I wouldn't trust anyone on their  tribe. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Try to win this guy back. But good luck, because he's been here a long time. <br/>Jeff: Stephanie, unfortunately for you, this game is over. Your quest for the million dollars done. <br/>That hurts. <br/>Jeff: You can put your buff in the fire on your way out. Matt, once again, you have seized the moment and lived to play  another day in this game. Phillip, you've seen Matt compete twice now. <br/>And I'm very impressed with Matt. In the old days of the samurai, they had something called the  bochuto code, which is what the samurai lived by. What I've seen in you, you are truly a samurai warrior. <br/>Thank you, Phillip. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>I appreciate it. <br/>Jeff: All right, Matt, you can head back to Redemption  Island and await your next opponent. <br/>Will do, Jeff. You know where to find me. <br/>Little Phillip couldn't keep his mouth shut, and I'm  telling you when the merge is coming, Phillip is ready to make a big move,  and by "Big move" he means let's get Rob out. <br/>I don't want to split our tribe, bro. <br/>I don't either. <br/>We want to stay strong. I don't want anybody to feel like we're not one cohesive unit,  you know what I mean? <br/>Okay, then tell them. It's your call. <br/>Right when we got back, Phillip asked me how much if any I  wanted to tell the tribe of what went on. We've been straight up so far. I'm not going to start that game, dude. That's not how I want to play. <br/>All right, man. <br/>I wasn't upset that Phillip suggested we don't say  anything to the tribe. In actuality, I was hoping for it, actually praying for him to  say something like that to me so I could just use it as amunition. An opportunity presents itself for me to throw Phillip under the  bus. You guys missed a crazy, crazy, crazy duel. <br/>Who did they send? <br/>They sent Stephanie. <br/>That's what we figured, yeah. <br/>Jeff was questioning her, and she let it all hang out. She basically looked at me and she's like, "Rob, watch out. They're coming for you." I took all this information and  relayed it all to the tribe because I want everybody on the same page. I want everybody to know that the target's on me so that they  feel safe, number one, and, number two, I need to keep everybody else against  Phillip. Right when we were walking on the beach he's like, "So what  do you want to tell them?" like, he didn't want to tell you guys. And I'm telling you, first opportunity, that's why, he's  flipping. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>100% he's flipping because we lose, he's goes to  redemption. And everything I just told you is 100% true. With all the attention focused on Phillip and everybody using  him as a punching bag, I'm free to maneuver and do what I need to do. <br/>Phillip, are you okay? <br/>I'm fine. Thank you. <br/>Everything I suspected about Phillip is confirmed. If we lose, there won't be any blindside. I'll go right up to Phillip when he asks me who to vote for and  I'll say, "You know what, Phillip? You're going home." I'll front-side him. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Nothing too nasty. I mean nothing you wouldn't-- nothing unexpected. <br/>She told the other team to pull hard, beat us. <br/>Did she really? <br/>Yes, she did. <br/>I don't think it was particularly egregious manner. It was nothing out of the ordinary, nothing you wouldn't have  expected. <br/>How is Matt doing? <br/>He's doing good, but he's for the other team. He ain't going to swap sides so don't plan on Matt favoring us. <br/>Yeah, and if you flip...  After the merge...  No one respects a flipper. <br/>Then you're the first one to go. <br/>I think David, if we merge, he would jump to their team,  just, bam, like that. I do believe. Well, he's a lawyer, and lawyers, you gotta look at them that  way. They're-- they think they're a lot better than everybody else. <br/>Today is the day to fish. First time we caught them all was after a big storm. <br/>When the water is dumping out from there, that's when all  the bait fish wash out from the river like the minnow and bring the bigger  fish in to shore. <br/>The 30-year-old David attorney is telling the 45-year-old Ralph,  mr. Outdoorsman, that we ought to go fishing. So dave is getting tough to stomach. <br/>Okay, dave is bugging me. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We should go fish now." you know. Like shut up. I want to, like, punch him in the face, him and his smirk. It's like picking his wound. <br/>You see that the face he made? <br/>No. <br/>Sarita, show the face he made. <br/>He's like you guys ought to be fish you now and he's  like... David's personality is I find him selfish and egotistical. As much as he thinks he's the king of riding the wild waters of  "Survivor" he isn't savvy at the social game at all. <br/>I'm guessing Steve's not real happy with the fact that I  decided to do my own thing last night. <br/>I don't know. David, he might be smart, but it don't take smart to win this  game. It just takes somebody that knows how to maneuver around and play  the ball. When it comes out here in the general world, survivin', he's got  to go. <br/>He pRobably will only eat that. Don't eat too much of the crispy stuff. I told him I would save it for him. <br/>There's plenty of it. <br/>Yeah, there's a lot. <br/>I think Rob will like the stuff on the bottom. <br/>I want one scoop of the crispy, okay, just one. <br/>That's all Rob is going to eat. <br/>But I didn't have one scoop of the crispy. <br/>We didn't either. <br/>We didn't have any. <br/>Phillip, really. <br/>Forget it. <br/>You can have all you want. <br/>I mean, I don't see where one scoop of the crispy would Matter. <br/>It's Rob's serving. It's fine. <br/>When we make it, guys, we're all entitled to whatever is  made, okay, in equal proportions. So if I wanted a scoop of crispy and-- look, I saw you guys get  a scoop of the crispy. Let's not make a mountain out of a mole hill, for crying out  loud. I'm standing right there. <br/>Here, bro. <br/>I don't want it. Whenever I-- it's like, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob! Everybody likes the brown crispy rice, but Rob likes it in  particular. I walked over and said, "Can I have a little scoop, a  spoonful, a teaspoonful of the crispy?" "No, no, no, you can't. It's all for Rob. Even though there's a full portion. You can have some of that but you can't have any of the  crispy." how asinine is that? <br/>Right here. <br/>I'm sick and tired of the fact that they act like because Boston  Rob is Boston Rob, he gets deference to everything. Just because they sleep in his underwear every night-- and  that's not speaking figuratively, that's literally-- they're sharing his  underwear, the girls, his socks, his bed, and so they want to pay him  deference on everything. <br/>Let it be known, the first opportunity I have to eliminate  him, I will. <br/>Let him eat that. <br/>That's what I said. And he said, "No. I don't want that."  "Don't make a mountain out of a mole  hill."  Oh, well. <br/>All due respect, I'm a 52-year-old man, and the senior  member of this tribe. I don't know what world they're coming from, but in any other  world, I would be given the deference simply because of my age. I'm certainly entitled to it, if we're going to call this a  tribe. But instead I get the redheaded stepchild treatment. <br/>Am I feeling part of this tribe? Hell no! Am I giving 100% to this tribe, 110% to this tribe? Hell yeah! And I'm sick of it. I'm not quitting, I'm here to stay, but I want it to be on  record there is a division in this tribe, not of my making, of their making. That's all I have to say. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>We are! <br/>Jeff: First things first, I will take it back again, Ometepe. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. On my go, both tribes will race through a series of obstacles  working together to collect bags of balls along the way. Once you've cleared all the obstacles, you must shoot the balls  into a basket. First tribe to get all six balls in their basket wins immunity,  is safe from the vote. Losers go to tribal council where somebody will be voted out of  the tribe and sent to Redemption Island. Any questions? <br/>What are we playing for? <br/>What are we playing for? <br/>Jeff: In addition, you are playing for reward. The winning tribe will leave here via helicopter, taken for a  beautiful afternoon picnic. You'll enjoy fruits, vegetables, cheese, chocolate, cookies. You'll have a cooler full of alcoholic and non-alcoholic-- Natalie--  beverages. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: we are back even. Six on six, nobody sitting out of this challenge. Give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. Here we go. For immunity and reward, survivors ready? Go! Both tribes hit the hay hard. Flying over it. <br/>Come on, get up! <br/>Jeff: Sarita going to work on that first bag for Zapatera,  Rob for Ometepe. Rob working quickly on that first bag of balls. Sarita taking a little time for Zapatera. Ometepe opening up a big lead right now. Zapatera really slowing down. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: Zapatera has their first bag of balls. <br/>Go, Ometepe! Everybody on the mat! Now you can go! Phillip now caught up in the ropes! <br/>You're going up. <br/>Up, up, up, up. <br/>Jeff: Rob working on that bag of balls again for Ometepe. Dave taking over for Zapatera. David has it for Zapatera. Zapatera's picked up a lot of time. Rob still struggling with those balls. Going the wrong way! Rob is now hung up. Ometepe has their second bag. Let's go! Ometepe has lost time. They had a big lead. <br/>Come on! <br/>Go, go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: Everybody through the crawl. <br/>Behind you, Phillip! <br/>Jeff: Zapatera working on their third and final bag of  balls. Phillip and Rob really dragging it for Ometepe. <br/>Get up! Get up! <br/>Come on! <br/>Jeff: Phillip slowing down. Rob at the end. David now having trouble with that third and final bag. <br/>Get me up! Get me up! <br/>Jeff: Rob trying to pick up some time. David now figuring it out. He's using his hands. David has the third and final bag for Zapatera. Through the brick wall! A big hit by Zapatera. Rob gotta keep it moving. Zapatera through the wall first! <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Get untying, guys! <br/>Jeff: Rob has the third and final bag for Ometepe. Grant through the wall! Everybody through the wall! <br/>Jeff: Phillip smashes through the bricks. Ometepe now through the wall! Gotta get all six balls in the basket. Both tribes already shooting balls now. Ometepe has their first ball in. Ralph not having any luck. Grant is two for two. Grant has two in for Ometepe. Zapatera with zero. Zapatera has their first ball. Ometepe has their third ball. Zapatera with their second ball. Their third ball. We are tied 3-3. There are six balls total. Gotta get all six in. Zapatera has their fourth ball in the net. Zapatera has their fifth ball in. Zapatera has one left. Grant puts one in for Ometepe. It is 5-4. Big reward and bigger immunity on the line. Ometepe with their fifth ball in. Both tribes have one left. Ometepe-- oh, in and out. Grant does it! Ometepe wins immunity and reward! <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Sorry, guys. <br/>Come on. <br/>We almost lost you, Phillip. <br/>We were close. <br/>Jeff: Ometepe, once again congratulations. All right, Zapatera, you are now down to six members. After tonight's tribal council, five. Things are going from bad to worse. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I will see you tonight where somebody will be voted out and sent  to Redemption Island. Ometepe, no tribal council tonight. Should be a nice, enjoyable day. Have a good time. [ applause ]  Some tribes advance boldly. Weak tribes grow agitated. But superior tribes, like ours, we find a way to win. And we did. <br/>This is my fourth time on "Survivor" and I've  been on a lot of rewards, but I'll tell you what I've never done is landed on  top of an active volcano. Definitely one of the coolest experiences I've ever had. <br/>Whoa! <br/>Be careful. <br/>Watch your feet, y'all. <br/>Take a look at that. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Wow. <br/>Hello! Hello! <br/>It's a hole is that goes straight to the center of the  earth. <br/>Literally, I am sitting on the edge of a volcano right  now. I'm looking down at it right now, bro. I could fall in here and never be heard from again. <br/>Ometepe! <br/>And what's special about it is we get to do it as a tribe  together and just enjoy it. <br/>What do we got? [ cheering ]  What's in there? <br/>Crackers. <br/>Crackers! Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm actually having an incredible day today. We have a numbers advantage. And for me, I haven't always felt like I was totally inclusive  with the group. But today, having a wonderful meal right now. <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>Delicious. <br/>Mmm! And surviving with the tribe. <br/>We won again! <br/>We won again! <br/>I find it hard not to be tribal in my thinking, community  in my thinking, so right now I'm on top of the earth. <br/>We got to keep this going. <br/>Comeback kids. <br/>They are good but we are better. <br/>What's in that jar right there? <br/>Oh, dude, try it. They're so good. Chocolate swirled in wafer. <br/>I've been on enough rewards to know whenever you win one,  there's gonna be a clue. So immediately it hits me, the cookies are cylindrical shaped. The clue's got to be in there. <br/>Those will make your heart stop. <br/>And sure enough in the center is a clue wrapped up like a  cookie. <br/>Do you put pesto on your sandwich? <br/>No. You have some? <br/>Dude, it's so good! But it really doesn't even Matter what it says because I already  have the idol, so... Might as well just throw it away in the volcano! Bye-bye! <br/>That certainly sucked. So today's challenge was an awesome challenge. The outcome completely sucked. That's three losses in a row, all three for food. We're starving out here. We're tired of going to tribal. After tonight it's going to be six of them and five of us. Not a good situation with a looming merge. <br/>So what do we think? This is pRobably the only time we're really going to have to  talk. <br/>I was thinking dave. <br/>Are you guys feeling good about losing the puzzle maker? I want the tribe to win. <br/>Michael can more than fill his shoes on the puzzles. <br/>I haven't seen him do anything too outstanding at any of the  challenges. <br/>I feel like I can do anything dave can do and I feel  like-- because I would say kick me off if I felt like dave was better than  me. I just don't feel like he is. I-- I don't think he's good. Tonight in tribal council I'm going to vote for David because  he's a loose cannon, and knowing that he voted for me last time, knowing that  he doesn't trust me at all, it doesn't really bode well for the future. <br/>What do you think? <br/>I just want to make sure you're on the program. I talked to the other four. <br/>You have? <br/>Yeah. <br/>They want to get dave? <br/>It's beside the point. I don't trust dave not to get together with them before the end  of the day and get one of us off. I really don't. I don't trust dave at all. <br/>No, I don't either. <br/>But I definitely think this next one is dave. <br/>You're pRobably right. <br/>I feel like David is going to have a really good chance of  beating boy wonder on Redemption Island, which I don't want to see him come  back. He's going to come back like a hell on wheels for me, but... The  game is the game. <br/>I feel a little bit more nervous tonight than I have in  the past, primarily because I don't know that the tribe has seen the light in  terms of keeping strength. Last time, nobody was interested in focusing on strength of the  tribe, and they wanted to focus on trust. If that happens again, there's a distinct possibility I am the  one going home. <br/>Here comes dave. Good work! <br/>I haven't seen him pick up that big a piece of lumber  since we've been here. <br/>Yeah, exactly. <br/>We were going to target David. But Sarita struggled today. She fumbled a couple of times, couldn't get the bag open, she  started panicking. It just wasn't coming together for her. David, on the other hand, really came through for us. <br/>For the strength of the tribe in challenges, we think  we've got to keep dave. <br/>Really? <br/>In my eyes, you know, I don't trust David. <br/>I don't trust him at all. <br/>I love Sarita, I think she's great but she's been super,  super weak at every challenge. She tends to get flustered and freaked out a little bit. She just doesn't have that intestinal fortitude, you know. She's absolute the weakest at this point. Tonight we have two options-- David or Sarita. Sarita very loyal, very trustworthy. However, in challenges she's very flustered and not very strong. David, on the other hand, he's a thinker. He's very smart. I think he'll help us get through future challenges with  puzzles. However, he's a little bit harder to trust, and if we end up  merging some time soon, who do we want to have with us at the merge? It's a total catch-22 at this point. Either we have a loyal tribe or we have a tad bit stronger  tribe. Right now we're in a bit of a tailspin and we have a couple  thousand feet before we hit the deck and crash and burn so we need to figure  a way out of this tailspin. <br/>Jeff: All right, Ralph, you tell me-- what has happened to  Zapatera? <br/>Jeff, it was pretty close today. We was ahead, but when it got to the balls...  Can I pipe in? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: David, finish this sentence, "Excuses are  for..."? <br/>Losers. <br/>I'm a loser then. <br/>Jeff: Julie, there is one glaring stat. Since you threw the challenge to get rid of Russell you have  lost the next three of four challenges. <br/>That's correct. It is bad karma. At the time, Jeff, we thought our tribe was way stronger than  the other tribe and we thought we could spare to throw one challenge and we  still feel like we're stronger than the other tribe. <br/>Jeff: David, maybe the pRoblem isn't that you're not as  strong as the other tribe. Maybe the pRoblem is you're just not as cohesive. <br/>I think that's exactly what the pRoblem is. It's a lack of unity here. When we were banded together against Russell that was something  we all had a similar goal towards. But if you look at the other tribe, it looks like they're all  friends. They're all sitting there laughing, giggling, and having a good  time. It would seem to me that's a component of their daily life. <br/>Jeff: Ralph, does that ring true to you, how important it  is that the entire group be cohesive? <br/>Well, first, Jeff, I don't know what "Cohesive"  means. <br/>Jeff: well in your job you manage a group of guys, right? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: would you rather have a dozen guys who are really  strong but didn't get along very well or a dozen guys that maybe aren't that  strong but work well as a unit. <br/>I disagree. <br/>Jeff: It's a question. Which would you rather have? <br/>I would rather have ones that are stronger because if they  do get along, yak, yak, yak, yak. <br/>I respectfully disagree. I think any coach would rather have a group that gets along. And I really believe that we're all working together. <br/>Jeff: Krista would disagree, Stephanie would disagree, and  from what I see recently between David and Sarita, David would pRobably  disagree. <br/>That's why Krista and Stephanie are gone. They were the dissenters among the group. David may disagree but I know that we feel we're stronger. <br/>Jeff: David, you have been pretty vocal in your support of  Krista and Stephanie. Are you concerned that may now put the target on you? <br/>Absolutely. Stephanie's refusal to vote with the tribe and instead voting  with Krista tipped the scales against her ultimately. The fact that I did the same thing at the last tribal council  concerns me but I gave Stephanie my word. And I'm not gonna jump backwards at that point. <br/>Jeff: Sarita, David makes the argument by keeping his word  he is actually showing he's loyal. <br/>That doesn't really fly with me just because I trusted in  the six. <br/>I trusted in the six and I don't have any individual trust  in you. <br/>I was surprised when David voted for me last week. I thought the six was strong and no Matter what differences we  had I would never have written his name down because I do honor my alliances. But then he yelled at me a couple of times and got me in my face  and that's not a person I can trust. It doesn't mean the six change, it meant that I wasn't gonna be  thick as thieves with David. <br/>Carry on after the six so there was basically no alliance  between the two of us but she was still willing to work with me within the  six. <br/>We had an agreement for the six and we had a hierarchy of  what we were going to do, and he flipped on that and decided to align with Stephanie. <br/>I didn't flip on any hierarchy. I did what I thought was best for the tribe. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: But tonight, things are different because there is  no Stephanie and there is no Krista. <br/>And my name was written down. <br/>Jeff: So now you're gunning for David. <br/>Um...  Of course she is. It's obvious. That question doesn't even need to be asked. If she thinks I've betrayed the alliance of course she's going  to go after me. I didn't plead my case to anyone this afternoon. Everyone has their mind made up. Whether it's me or her, so be it. <br/>Jeff: All right, well this group of six is about to be  broken up. It's time to vote. Julie, you're up. <br/>I was always honest with you, and you betrayed me. It's unfortunate because you have a lot of great qualities. <br/>I hope you love Redemption Island as much as I love  writing your name down. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Sarita. David. Two votes David, one vote Sarita. Sarita. We're tied-- two votes Sarita, two votes David. Sarita. That's three votes Sarita, two votes David, one vote left. Seventh person voted out of "Survivor: Redemption Island,"  Sarita. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Jeff: Need to bring me your torch. <br/>I wish I'd brought my stuff. <br/>Don't get too confident. <br/>Jeff: Sarita, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Thank you. Bye, guys. <br/>Jeff: You will have a chance to get back in this game. Grab your torch, head to Redemption Island. Good luck. Well, if there was any question as to whether or not this is one  cohesive group, tonight's tribal council certainly answered it. No. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor":  That cut my foot pretty badly. <br/>Jeff: An injury hurts Matt's chances in the most important  duel yet. The winner of today's duel will go back in the game. And Rob hears the three words that could put an end to his  dominance-- we are merged. <br/>This is a whole new game. <br/>I can see paranoia getting to him. <br/>I know they're coming after me. <br/>In the end, David won out, basically saying he was the  stronger, which is fine. What they don't realize is you don't always pick the stronger,  especially now that you're getting down. You want someone who maybe will not win individual immunity. They want to make the most Robust football team they can  possibly make. God love them for it.
