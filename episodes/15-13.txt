<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: Peih-Gee picked Denise and Erik to go  with her on a reward to the legendary Shaolin Temple... ...where Denise got  to show off her martial arts skills. Back at camp, Amanda, Todd, Courtney, and James made a final four pact. <br/>I've been the main guy trying to hold this thing together, and that's what  I'm going to do. <br/>Probst: And because he had both hidden immunity idols, James was in the best  position to win it all. At the immunity challenge... Erik wins individual immunity. ...Erik a victory locked in Peih-Gee as the next to go. <br/>Get rid of Peih-Gee tonight, and then after that focus on getting rid of  Erik, and then it's all cake after that. <br/>Probst: But Amanda had other ideas. She hatched a plan to take out She hatched a plan to take out James. James. And everyone jumped at the And everyone jumped at the chance. chance. <br/>Probst: At tribal council, James trusted his alliance... Once the votes are  read the decision is final. ...so he didn't play one of his idols. Tenth person voted out, and the fourth member of our jury, James. By failing to recognize he was in danger, the most powerful player in the  game was gone, taking the idols with him. James, the tribe has spoken. Six are left. Six are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>I think that was the most shocking tribal council yet. I think that Jean-Robert got a big kick out of James getting voted out. <br/>I think so, too. <br/>He was like, "Do-do-do, they got you, do-do-do."  "Wow," is all I have to say about tribal council. I was so nervous that idea wouldn't work to vote James out, and it did. I wonder how mad James is right now. <br/>Lord, have mercy. What did you say? I was like, "I hope to god this doesn't turn into a screaming match back  at the camp."  I said, "If this works, wow. If it doesn't, I'm scared for my life."  If it doesn't work and he comes back here, I was like, "Oh, my god,  could you imagine if he came back here?" We would all be dead. <br/>James is gone. He didn't use the idols. I'm still here. I had a vote cast against me. My heart was pounding. We are in the top six. <br/>How about we celebrate we are in the top six? <br/>Yay! <br/>We'll bitch a little bit tomorrow. It will probably rain. It will probably rain again. <br/>Group hug, everybody. <br/>Where is Peih-Gee? Where is Peih-Gee? <br/>Seeing original Fei Long members turn on each other absolutely gives me hope. There must be a crack old tribal lines somewhere, because Erik and I are  still around. <br/>Peeg, you and your Buddha outfit. You're tripping me out. <br/>If I can get one or maybe even two more people, we could possibly cause a tie  at tribal council, which would be kind of interesting. I'm not giving up until I'm voted out. You know, I love it that I'm You know, I love it that I'm still here. still here. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK  TELEVISION TELEVISION TELEVISION [ theme song playing] [ theme song playing]  Seems like we've been here for years. âª What am I doing here? <br/>All I really want is a beer. <br/>This is so crazy. I can't even describe to you how miserable I feel. I have thought of home for the past week and a half and how much I miss it. You know, I'm not an emotional person at all, but it kills you, kills you--  oh, man. So close. <br/>We've got a week left. Somebody has a week left. <br/>Seven nights and six days. <br/>And one poor unfortunate soul...  ...is going to go home. <br/>...will be taken out of the rain. My alliance in the game is me, Courtney, Amanda, and Denise. We want to get rid of Erik and Peih-Gee. That is the goal. But at the same time, you can't trust anybody 100% because in all reality, we  all want one million dollars. And if they turn on me, it would be a very smart move on their part to get  rid of me now. Of course, I'm not going to tell Of course, I'm not going to tell them that. them that. them that. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Today's challenge is all about speed and communication. Here's how it works-- for today's challenge, you will be paired up in teams  of two. Each team will be separated at opposite ends of a maze. On my "go," you must navigate your way through the maze, find your  partner, and make your way to the center platform. First team it get there wins. Make sense? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: To make it a bit more interesting, you'll be blindfolded. Should we get you paired up? <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: All right, Erik, you're going to be paired up with your mom. <br/>What? <br/>Probst: Come on out, Denise. Don't be shy. Don't be shy. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Is this really happening? <br/>Look at you! <br/>Yeah, I'm all skinny and bearded. <br/>Probst: Denise, take a spot over here. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Probst: Amanda, here's your partner, your sister, Katrina. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Oh, my god!

My god, you're skinny! <br/>It's a good weight loss program. program. Okay. Okay. <br/>Probst: Todd, you ready for some love? Your sister Brandy's here. Come on out, Brandy! Come on out, Brandy! Brandy's not going to walk. Brandy's not going to walk. Brandy's not going to walk. That's a hug. That's a hug. <br/>Okay, okay. I'm so glad you're here. How is everybody? <br/>Good. <br/>Kim's good, right? <br/>Kim's good, right? Is the baby okay? Is the baby okay? Okay. Okay. <br/>Probst: Todd what was the last question? <br/>My little sister was pregnant, and she lost her baby, but it's okay. <br/>Probst: Your other sister? <br/>Yeah. One a little bit younger than Brandy. So...  Probst: So, Brandy, the message you gave Todd is that your sister lost the  baby, but your sister herself is doing all right. <br/>She's doing good. She's doing good. <br/>That's all that matters. It's okay. It's okay. <br/>Probst: Courtney, I know you're ready for some love. you're ready for some love. Here's your daddy Graham. Here's your daddy Graham. Here's your daddy Graham. Looking debonair. Looking debonair. <br/>I told you he'd wear a suit. <br/>I'm English. I don't do... I don't do shorts. <br/>He's English. <br/>Probst: All right, guys. Graham, take a spot. <br/>Thank you. Thanks. <br/>Probst: Denise, I think there's somebody back there really anxious to see  you-- your husband. Come on out, Robert! Come on out, Robert! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! <br/>You want them? I'll give them to you. <br/>Probst: She was going to drag you all the way over there. All right, let me catch the loved ones up on what the survivors already know,  which is you are not just here to bring them love. You are going to participate in this challenge. <br/>I'm sorry, dad. I didn't know. They didn't tell me! I'm sorry! <br/>Probst: Today, you are playing for a boat trip out on the lake, a huge meal,  and love in the form of a phone call from family members back home. The winning team will receive this Sprint phone. Sprint, also known for speed and communication, is making this all possible. Shall we get started? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: You guys head off this way. this way. You head off this way. You head off this way. Here we go. For reward. Survivors and loved ones ready? Go! First pair of survivor and loved one to reach the platform wins reward. <br/>Rob, where are you?! <br/>Coming at you. <br/>Coming at me, all right, here we go. <br/>Okay, Amanda, where are you at? <br/>Katrina, that's me. <br/>Mom, where are you? <br/>I'm over here. <br/>Are you somewhere near the center? <br/>I have no idea. <br/>Probst: Some loved ones getting close, others still very far away. <br/>Lawrence, dad, where are you? Lawrence? <br/>I hear you, Peih-Gee. I can't get to you. It's a dead end over there. <br/>I'm in the center, Brandy. Where are you at? <br/>I'm not sure. I'm over here somewhere. <br/>Katrina! <br/>Amanda! <br/>Denise, I'm towards the middle. <br/>Rob, I hear you, where are you? <br/>I'm close. Where are you at? <br/>Right here, right here, but I'm stuck. <br/>Probst: Denise and Robert have connected. They've still got to make their way to the center platform. <br/>Todd! <br/>I'm coming to your voice, stay cool. <br/>Bloody nose, bloody nose. [ making bird calls]  Probst: Amanda and Katrina communicating like wild birds. <br/>Stop that noise. <br/>Peih-Gee! <br/>Yeah, I hear you, dad, right here, Lawrence. <br/>I'm right here. <br/>Probst: Peih-Gee has found her dad, Lawrence. <br/>This direction, over there. <br/>Probst: Lawrence trying to point her in the right direction. That's not going to help when you can't see. <br/>Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! Where the hell are you? Courtney still looking for her father. <br/>Oh, stop it, Probst. <br/>Look, we're going to go around the circle, find the opening on the other side  of this. <br/>Probst: Denise and her husband are working together, trying to find their way  to the center platform. [ making bird calls]  I'm here! <br/>All the way around. Just keep going. <br/>Probst: Denise and Robert getting very close to winning this challenge. Denise is paired up with Robert. They're looking for the steps. Denise and Robert win reward! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Yeah, Denise! <br/>Whoo! Yeah! <br/>Probst: Take off your blindfolds. It's over. All right, Denise and Robert. Here's what's going to happen-- you're going to go out on a boat. You're going to have a nice meal. I'm going to turn this Sprint phone on right now, because you're going to get  a phone call. Keep this phone turned on. In addition, you're going to choose two survivors to come along with you and  bring their loved ones. Who's the first survivor that you're going to bring along with their loved  one? <br/>Todd. <br/>Probst: Todd and his sister, Brandy, are going with you. Denise, you look pained to have to make another decision. <br/>This is a very tough decision for me, Jeff. I'm sorry, I'm going to have to go with Amanda. <br/>Probst: Amanda and her sister going on the reward. <br/>Thank you! Thank you so much. <br/>Probst: All right, the good part of the reward is over. Now comes the tough part. Time for you guys to say good[1]bye  to your loved ones. <br/>Good-bye. <br/>Thanks for coming. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: All right, Lawrence. <br/>Probst: All right, Lawrence. <br/>Probst: All right, Erik, Peih-Gee, Courtney, grab your stuff, head back to  camp. <br/>Have fun, guys. <br/>Probst: Okay, there is one more element to this reward. When the afternoon is over, the loved ones are going to spend the night at  your camp. They're going to get a chance to experience what you've been living for 31  days. Boat's waiting for you. Boat's waiting for you. Have fun. Have fun. <br/>Oh, my god, there's ribs. Oh, look at the chicken. There's pizza. <br/>There's pizza? Are you serious? <br/>Guys, dig in. <br/>We have been eating off the ground, literally. <br/>Rip it apart. <br/>You have never seen me eat like this, have you? <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>How is it, honey? Just for my husband to be here in China... he's afraid to fly. Just for him to come here, that means a lot to me. But to come here and compete and to win a challenge together, it's so  uplifting. I've been taken over the top. <br/>Ah! Oh, my god! <br/>Oh, look at that! <br/>That's Todd's piece right there. <br/>Do you want some? <br/>Do you want some? <br/>Oh, hell, yeah, baby. <br/>Oh, hell, yeah, baby. <br/>This is best chocolate cake I have ever had in my life. [ phone ringing]  Your phone's ringing. <br/>There's my call, hon. <br/>There they are, look! <br/>Say hello. <br/>Hello? <br/>Hi. <br/>All of a sudden I can hear people crying in the background. And it's my oldest daughter, Erin. <br/>Don't cry. You've got to talk to me. How did you guys do in the tournament? All right! Daddy's here with me. <br/>And I smell so bad. <br/>Can you smell me from there? <br/>Smell-a-vision. <br/>I'm smiling just thinking about you, sweet pea. I think about you every day. No, don't cry. I miss you so much. <br/>I love you, too. You have a good night, okay? And I'll see you really, really soon. <br/>I love you. Good night, baby. Being able to hear their voices and have my husband here with me today, it  gives me the strength, definitely, to keep on going, and, I mean, I'm here to  the end. I'm going to grab strength from them and embrace it and just them and embrace  it and just keep on going. keep on going. <br/>I wonder why Denise picked Amanda. I'll be honest, I'm kind of pissed that she didn't pick me, because I took  her off on a fat reward. <br/>I've got to get this off my chest-- I do not believe Todd's story. <br/>I could not believe that he... like, "Oh, my sister had an unplanned  teenage pregnancy, and then a convenient miscarriage." Gee whiz. You think the girl might not want the entire world to know about that. <br/>Like, if it's true, my deepest condolences to his family. <br/>I thought the same thing. I was like, "Oh, how convenient." And then he was the first one  picked by Denise. Right. Todd was going for the Oscar with his performance of "My sister had a  convenient miscarriage." And then of course Jeff was like, "Todd,  it looks like you just got some bad news. What happened?" And Todd's like "My sister. She was pregnant and she... she lost the baby. But it happened for a reason." Like, that is not, like the fake Johnny  Fair Play, "My grandma died." You can almost forgive that. You can almost forgive that. That's funny. That's funny. <br/>What is that? <br/>What is that? <br/>Shut up! <br/>Shut up! <br/>Indulge, kids! Indulge! <br/>Kinky! <br/>When the loved ones showed up, you know, we were sourpusses. We were pissed that we lost the challenge, pissed we didn't get to go. I really didn't feel like interacting with anybody. <br/>I'm so bad with names. Mr. Denise...  It's Robert. <br/>So how proud are you of Denise? <br/>Very, very proud. <br/>It was really tough. And especially for me. Like, I picked Denise to go with me on a literally once-in-a[1]lifetime  reward trip, and, you know, she didn't pick me. know, she didn't pick me. And it sucks. And it sucks. <br/>Amanda, how perfect it is that we...  I know! <br/>I can't believe it. <br/>Really, we're just so lucky that Denise got to pick two people and she chose  us. <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>So surreal. <br/>And the other thing that scared me was when I whispered about Kim, you know,  I was like, "They're going to think I'm lying, like I'm pulling a big  lie to see my sister." Hopefully everybody believes it because it wasn't  a lie. <br/>I'm so sorry about that. <br/>You know, I know there's been a lot of pointing at me as to a strategic  threat, but it was all true. It was all from the heart, you know? I wasn't out to be some snake right there. I really was concerned about my home. <br/>How pregnant was she? <br/>She was about two months. <br/>Three months now. <br/>She lost it a while ago, Todd. <br/>Did she? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Like, right after I left? <br/>Like, right after I left? <br/>Pretty much. <br/>Pretty much. <br/>Seems like you're getting along all right. <br/>Yeah, know, everybody seems to be okay. You know, I mean, like I said, there's a lot of young kids here, and I don't  have a lot in common with them. But we'll see what happens. I mean, I can only hope that Amanda and Todd stay with me, and we go to the  final three. If they backstab me and take Courtney, that's one of the chances I'm going to  have to take. But, I mean, to be out here all this time is still pretty damn good. <br/>Yeah. Play your game, that's all. Do what you... do what you think is right. <br/>I mean, obviously, it's not a good idea for us to backstab anyone anymore,  but I think as long as we take Denise to the final four she'll understand. <br/>Would you vote out Denise before Courtney, or no? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Because we can win better...  She works hard all week. I mean, she has kids. <br/>I freaking love Denise. I do. <br/>The thing is, in the final three, she will play her sob story. <br/>That's right. We... like, Amanda, and I and Courtney are all pretty much on the same level,  because we've pissed a lot of the people on the jury off. And so, like, it's a pretty even chance between all of us. So I'm like...  And we would make such a cute final three. <br/>Oh, you guys can do this. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You got it. <br/>Perfect. <br/>It's like a dream. <br/>It's like a dream. <br/>Perfect. <br/>Perfect. <br/>I know you'll do good. <br/>I'm going to do my best. <br/>Easily into the one or two  Easily into the one or two spot. spot. You know what you're doing. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I love you. My god, you smell bad. <br/>I know. I'm so sorry. I stink. <br/>I've got to smell just as bad, though. <br/>You're getting there, honey. You're fitting right in with You're fitting right in with this group, I tell  you. this group, I tell you. <br/>32 days. I can make it a few more. I can make it a few more.

So you want to feel comfortable, and you want to feel like you can trust  people, and you just can't, though. You've got to keep on your toes. You've got to keep yourself nervous, or else you're going to nervous, or else  you're going to get screwed. get screwed. <br/>No, I know. <br/>No, I know. I could see it, you know. I could see it, you know. It wasn't my fault. You know, it just happened to work out that way. I don't want to be the next one to go. <br/>After the loved ones left, Denise came over and tried to kind of fix that  little problem that she might have with problem that she might have with me,  like, not getting picked. me, like, not getting picked. <br/>I do feel a little better that at least she took the time to come talk to me. I might need her vote if I can convince her to try to vote convince her to  try to vote somebody else off. somebody else off. <br/>I mean, I just wanted to see where you're standing, and I wanted you to see  where I'm coming from, you know what I mean? <br/>Right now I'm going to concentrate on gathering up all my energy and focus on  winning that challenge, because I really need it. Every time since the merge, I Every time since the merge, I feel like I need  to win. feel like I need to win. feel like I need to win. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: First things first. <br/>Probst: First things first. Erik, give it up. Erik, give it up. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. You are going to have to dig deep, as today's challenge will test you both  physically and mentally. For today's challenge, you'll be attached to a rope which snakes through a  series of obstacles. At each obstacle, you must untangle your rope by either moving over, under,  or around each post in order to continue. At the end of the course, you'll find a set of boxes. Each box contains one true and one false statement about Chinese inventions. Next to each statement is a key. Choose the statement you think is true, grab the key, race back to the start. If you're right, your key will open a lock. If you're wrong, you have to go back and try again. First person to answer three questions correctly and open three locks will  raise their flag. First person to raise their flag wins immunity, guaranteed a one[1]in-five  shot at winning this game. We'll get started. We'll get started. Head up on the deck. Head up on the deck. Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready? Go! You are attached to a rope that runs the length of this course. Erik flies over. Amanda's over. Todd making quick work of it. Denise is over. Todd and Amanda making their way through the swamp. Peih-Gee's right there. Todd first up the mountain. Amanda right behind. Erik snagged on one of the posts. It's Todd and Amanda in the It's Todd and Amanda in the lead. lead. Todd and Amanda both untying their first box. There are two statements. One is true, one is false. One is true, one is false. Todd has his first key. Todd has his first key. Amanda has her first key. Peih-Gee's made her first choice. Todd going to pass Erik as he heads to the start. Amanda heading back to the start with her first key. Peih-Gee heading back into the swamp with her first key. Big question for Todd-- did he choose the true statement? Will the key open a lock? And it does. Todd has his first lock open. Todd and Amanda both have one lock undone. Two locks left. Courtney struggling to get back with her first key. Erik trying to get back in it. Todd still in the lead. Amanda right behind. Peih-Gee back with her first key. Peih-Gee has her first lock open. She's heading back for her second. Todd, Amanda, Peih-Gee, all have one lock open. Denise and Erik struggling to stay in it. Todd at his second box. Amanda at her second box. Choose the one you think is true and grab the key. Amanda and Todd both with their second keys. Erik trying to stay in this challenge for immunity. First lock doesn't open. Second lock doesn't open. Third lock doesn't open. Erik now in dead last. Todd and Amanda neck and neck as they head back into the swamp. Peih-Gee heading back with her second key. Todd opens his second lock. Todd has only one lock left. Amanda trying her key in the first lock. It does not work. Trying it in the remaining lock. It does not work. This gives Todd a huge lead. Peih-Gee back with her second key. Did she choose right? She did. It's Peih-Gee and Todd with two locks open, one lock left. Amanda still fighting, hoping Todd will make a mistake. Peih-Gee right on Todd's tail. Todd has two statements left. If he chooses the true statement he'll have his third and final key. Todd has made his choice. The question is, did he choose the right statement? Peih-Gee now opening her third box. You want a guarantee you go final five, you keep fighting. Peih-Gee has made her choice. Todd and Peih-Gee both have their third keys. With that third key in hand, if he is right, Todd wins immunity. If he's wrong, it oppose the If he's wrong, it oppose the door for Peih-Gee. door for Peih-Gee. It does not open. It's taken every bit of strength Peih-Gee has left to get back with that  third key. If she's right, it was worth it. If she answered correctly, she If she answered correctly, she will open the  lock. will open the lock. She does. And with that, Peih-Gee wins And with that, Peih-Gee wins immunity! immunity! Peih-Gee, come on over. <br/>I never would have believed it. <br/>Probst: For the second time, Peih-Gee wins individual Peih-Gee wins  individual immunity. immunity. You are safe tonight at tribal council, guaranteed a spot in the final five. Denise, Todd, Courtney, Amanda, Erik, after 33 days, this game will come to  an end for one of you. See you tonight at tribal council. council. Head on back to camp. Head on back to camp. <br/>You know, honestly, like, I can't believe I won. I'm still crying about it. Wow. I've been, like, underdog this whole time I've been here. Every council that I'm not wearing the necklace, I expect to be voted out,  you know, so...  Erik, come to the table. The muddy rice is ready. <br/>This is probably one of, like my proudest moments, like, I've ever had in my  entire life. I'm safe tonight, but it's been, like, really mentally and like, really  mentally and physically exhausting. physically exhausting. physically exhausting. <br/>I'm okay. <br/>I'm okay. The only thing that would be a surprise is if Amanda would turn. But she won't, because she knows if Erik or Peih-Gee get even close to the  end, they've got it. So... It seemed so obvious to me, at least, when Peih-Gee won immunity, who  else is going to go tonight? Erik. It's probably the easiest vote for me so far. <br/>I feel like, even if I were on Todd's side, I would feel a little shaded out,  just by not trusting him with, like, that... what I think is false  information about his sister. <br/>He could very well have, like, played that up as, you know, a way to get  further in the game. It's what it sounded like to me, too. <br/>The hard part for me is that nobody here trusts Todd. It irks me, because I've thrown his name out, and it's like, "Okay,  well, if you don't trust him, then what's the deal?" I feel like I have  to fight. I feel like I have to fight. But I don't know what to do. But I don't know what to do. <br/>Thanks. <br/>I'll talk to Denise. <br/>My plan for tonight, is Erik and I are going to vote for Todd, and hope that  Denise Todd, and hope that Denise swings for a tie. swings for a tie. <br/>If she votes Erik out now, it's highly likely she'll end up in fourth place. If she tries to force a tie and Todd gets voted out tonight, suddenly her  chances of getting suddenly her chances of getting to top three are much  better. to top three are much better. <br/>I will. Denise isn't stupid, though. <br/>This tribal council right here is definitely a turning point in the game. If I do switch and head to that side of the coin, are my chances better? Probably. But am I going to win against one of those two? I don't know. I mean, it's just... right now I mean, it's just... right now it's, like, a  50-50 split. it's, like, a 50-50 split. <br/>Oh, that cold wind. I hate that cold wind. That means it's about to start That means it's about to start in my... in my...   I trust you, I do. <br/>I'm definitely the swing vote tonight. For me, personally, I mean, this is do or die. When I get up there, I mean, I don't know right now who I'm going to pick. What happens when I come back to camp after I make this decision? Who's going to be flipping out? This is a game for a million dollars, and right now, writing someone's name  down is a million-dollar signature. <br/>It's going to be the longest wait of my life. <br/>I'm a little nervous. I'm a little scared. I'm a little in turmoil. I'm a little flipping out. Thunder and lightning is getting closer, the decision's getting closer, my  mind is racing. This is just insane. I don't know. I just don't know what to do. I just don't know what to do. Can you help me? Can you help me? <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Jaime, Jean-Robert, Frosti, and James, voted out at the last James, voted out  at the last tribal council. tribal council. Let's talk about the reward challenge. Amanda, after spending the afternoon with Denise and seeing her and her  husband interact, did you feel like you knew Denise in a different way? <br/>Oh, definitely. I think she's blessed with a great life-- like, a great family, a great bond  with her kids. It was just nice to see that part of Denise, like the softer side of Denise. <br/>Probst: Denise, is there a downside to everybody seeing what a great life you  have? <br/>Oh, definitely. I mean, it's a two-way street-- yes, it's a good thing to let them see a  little bit, but it's bad because maybe they won't vote for me, or maybe they  feel a little scared to let me go against them in the finals. <br/>Probst: Why would they not want to go against you in the finals? <br/>I don't know if they would vote for someone who already has a good,  experienced life, and give them a million dollars. You know, maybe I'll get a sympathy vote or maybe I'll get more votes on the  jury because of that. <br/>Probst: Peih-Gee, for the last several tribal councils, it's either going to  have been you or Erik voted out. What's your take on tonight's vote? Do you think there is a strong consensus of what's going to happen, or do you  think there's a lot of ambiguity going on? <br/>I think there's definitely some ambiguity going on. You know, if you want to look at it as us being two against four, one person  is at the very bottom. And I don't see why they would make that leap and be like, "I don't want  to be fourth. I want to be first, possibly." It could turn the game around entirely  for one or two people, you know, and so it's something that everybody's going  to have to take into consideration very carefully. <br/>Probst: Denise, does the talk of the vote being up in the air concern you? <br/>Yeah. I mean, there's three people over there, there's two people here, and I mean,  I always feel like I'm on the bottom of the barrel. Yeah, I'm really, really scared. But I mean, hopefully tonight's the night that I can trust people. So to get a little further in the game would be great. I want to stay here for as long as I can. So, I mean, I'm just going to hope for the best. <br/>Probst: Todd, is there anybody here that you trust? <br/>Yes, I do trust people here. I have to, because I'm not wearing that necklace. So I feel like I do trust people, yeah. I just don't know exactly 100% how much. <br/>Probst: Erik, if it's you tonight, have you done everything you can to try  and crack this other four? <br/>Yeah. Honestly, like, I want... I want to be here tomorrow. And I hope people realize if there's four and two, there could be three and  three, and all of a sudden you're not fourth. You're in the top three and you've got a chance to win the million dollars. And I'm playing that card. I mean that is... that is all I've got left. <br/>Probst: Let's get to the vote. Peih-Gee, you have individual immunity. You can give it up, if you want. You cannot vote for Peih-Gee. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. It's time to vote. Amanda, you're up. Amanda, you're up. <br/>It's either going to be me or you tonight. I'm not ready to go. I'm not ready to go. So... So...  Too many people said they couldn't trust you. couldn't trust you. Sorry. Sorry. <br/>I'm sorry I have to do this. This is probably the biggest mistake I'm going to make in mistake I'm going  to make in this game. this game. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes.

It could be a  million dollar decision. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

Are we getting extreme Survivorparanoia right now? <br/>Probst: Amanda targets Todd. <br/>I could pull Peih-Gee and Denise together. <br/>Probst: But Todd fights back. <br/>An angry Todd is a bad Todd. <br/>I will be pissed off. <br/>Probst: As alliances crumble, no one is safe. <br/>I hope you guys vote to knock off Todd. off Todd. I'd like to see that happen. I'd like to see that happen. <br/>I wanted to go all the way to the top in this game, but, unfortunately, today  was my day. I think I can always look back and say, "Well, I could have done this  differently or I could have done that," but I'm mentally and physically  and emotionally exhausted. I made it 33 days. I'm really proud of myself. The five remaining contestants are going to battle it out, and I'm really  curious to see who I'm really curious to see who comes out on top.
