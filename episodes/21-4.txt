<br/> Jeff: Previously on  "Survivor." in a vast and unforgiving Nicaraguan rain forest,  former n.F.L. Coach Jimmy Johnson emerged as a leader of the older tribe, but Marty was  envious of the coach's star power. <br/>I need to remove him  so people will lose their daddy and they'll have to come to me. On the younger tribe, Brenda, a former n.F.L. Cheerleader, was at the top of the food chain. <br/>I have people on my  side without doing anything. I get a good vibe from nay and I'm tight with Chase. We could rule this. Kelly b. And Alina were at the bottom of the food chain, but they had a clue to the  hidden immunity idol. <br/>We keep it between us. <br/>At the challenge, the  younger tribe took a big risk by not using the medallion of power. <br/>We can take them  without using it. <br/>Jeff: And the risk  paid off. Because while Jimmy T. Distracted the older tribe... You're wasting me  back here. <br/>Jimmy t., be quiet. <br/>Jeff: ...The younger  tribe cruised to victory. <br/>If these people knew  what they were doing I would be the leader of this tribe. <br/>Jeff: After the  challenge, with total disregard for Kelly B.'s artificial leg, NaOnka tackled  her in order to get a new clue to the hidden immunity idol. <br/>I'll push you so hard  the leg will fall off. <br/>Jeff: She shared the  clue with Brenda. At tribal council, Jimmy T. Was gunning for Jimmy J. <br/>Maybe I'm a threat to  his leadership role because I am a leader where I come from. <br/>Jeff: The coach and Dan  were thought to be the weakest players but only jimmy would admit to it. <br/>I'm the oldest player  and one of the weakest, too. <br/>Jeff: Between Marty's  alpha male coup and Jimmy Johnson's honesty, the coach was sent home. The tribe has spoken. In voting out Jimmy Johnson you vote out a proven leader. Who's going to step up and fill those shoes? 17 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>How about you? You gonna make it through the night? Huh? <br/>Yeah. <br/>When the going gets  tough, you know what I mean? The leadership that Jimmy Johnson supplied in everybody's eyes was nothing. He gave a couple of cheerleader speeches that any chucklehead could do. He didn't put his best people forward. He definitely wasn't a Jimmy T. Fan and I wasn't going to get a lot of playing time with him calling the  shots and if he was a player he wouldn't have been on my alliance, that's for  sure. So I'm not going to miss him too much. Bad waves passing on the beach and for one desperate moment. He came back in our memory, guy's so crazy, so close. And still just out of reach... Jimmy t. Is putting on the Jimmy T. Show, annoying, singing, trying to do his best. It is Jimmy T., man, that's who this guy is. He's a loud mouth, he just... He has to hear his own voice 24/7. Take it easy, baby, make it last night, last all night... It's just... This  game tries your patience in so many ways and that guy's just... It's just  obnoxious. So I mean all you've got to do with Jimmy T. Is give him just a little bit of rope. That's all he needs and he'll hang himself from the nearest branch. <br/>Wow, this is  absolutely crazy. <br/>Someplace on Nicaragua  they must have had eight or ten inches of rain and all that water we've had  mixed with the last couple of days obviously is just come on down and found  its way back to the ocean. <br/>The entire beach is  just covered with debris. All sorts of wood and everything else. As a matter of fact, our beachfront here is gone. You can't even get in there. And it's all covered with mud. The ocean's all filled with mud. It's really a mess. <br/>It's been a tough day  and a half for me. I burnt my foot and cooked my sneakers. <br/>Cooked your shoe! Too bad we can't eat your shoe. Fillet of sole. [ã    \laughsã    ]. <br/>That's pretty funny. We don't get food soon we're going to be eating my foot. This place is God forsaken. <br/>It is. It's jinxed. <br/>Food is a huge issue. It's terrible. Our bay that we were supposed to do the fishing in is completely washed out  so we have... It's not like we're lazing around waiting for food to come. We have no food and no means of getting it. So we're down to two cups of rice a day and our rations is probably going to  put us down more than that. So, yeah, we're starving and we're pretty sick about it. <br/>He's just doing...  That's what we should be doing. He waits until the fish comes down, waits for them, snags 'em when he sees  him and that's how we should be fishing right now. <br/>We really need to  catch some fish today. <br/>Yeah, he's doing it. Look, that wasn't hard. And that's all we need to do is set out a net there. Okay, Jane, I haven't tried throwing this yet. I'm going to see what I can do. <br/>We can try to throw  it with the two of us. <br/>Well, there's guys  that do it in the real world, throw it with one guy. <br/>I know, but I'm not  one of those guys, maybe you are. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah... That was  going to work if it didn't hit my foot. I'll try a couple times, see what I can do. <br/>All right. <br/>Nothing. <br/>I do believe every  one of us is going to miss Jimmy Johnson. I mean, I'm going to miss him because he was as good a fisherman as anybody. But every team I've ever been on had a captain and a co-captain and they made  decisions based upon the ability of the tribe. And I'm hoping somebody's going to step up and say "I want that  role." I didn't even know  that it rained last night until I woke up this morning and I tried to climb  out of the shelter and it was a little wet. I slept that well. <br/>Is that thing out? <br/>Pretty much. <br/>Brenda has the hidden  immunity idol clue right now and she's been trying to decipher it. <br/>Dig eight yards west. Tree-mail? <br/>We're going to try to  look for it today but these clues are really, really hard to figure out. <br/>Maybe it's tree-mail. So, um, remember how the clue shows the tree and the guy next to the tree? And it has the sun, right? So it's west. <br/>You are good! <br/>So maybe like align  yourself with the tree and the sun so that you're right in front of it and  that's where you dig. Dig eight yards west of tree-mail. <br/>West is that way so  it's like in the bushes. <br/>Look, west... Look around, look  around. <br/>It's right there? <br/>What is that? <br/>That's it right there! <br/>Get it! Get it! Oh, my God! <br/>Where are we going to  put it? <br/>Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's the key to our life in the game. The immunity idol is mine, mine, it doesn't belong to anyone else. Brenda helped me find it but ultimately I figured it out and it's mine. <br/>That was crazy. <br/>The hidden immunity  idol is in my sock. It's not going anywhere. I came all the way out here from south central l.A. And I think it's starting to finally hit me that, you know, it's a million dollars  on the line, it's a million dollars on the line. <br/>When you find the  immunity idol you just don't tell anybody. <br/>And that would not  let anyone stand in my way. Not even a one-legged person can stand in my way as you can see. One shove she's out of here. <br/>It's lonely out here. <br/>The hardest thing for  me right now is to pretend that I like nay. Ugh. You know? <br/>I know. <br/>Kelly b. And I have really built a good relationship. I really like her. She's such a nice person and seeing the way nay treats her, it makes me so  furious. She tackled a girl with one leg. Like how sick is that? How can it be really that hard to find? <br/>The clues don't help. Nor does like searching everything, you know? <br/>We have to find it. <br/>I know where they  went. I saw their footsteps. They were over in this area. And they were, like, that's the only place they were at. Something's over here. <br/>I've been watching Alina  and Kelly B. Running like a wild banshee looking for the hidden immunity idol. They're not going to find it. The idol's already found and it's hidden. So what do I have to lose right now? Nothing. So I'm going to try to scare them because they're weak. If you get in their head and they're scared, they're not going to know what  to do. You guys looking for something? <br/>No secret, looking  for the same thing you're looking for. <br/>So if you see me  watching you guys... Follow us. <br/>What? You know I don't like you. Never have liked you. Don't trust you. <br/>Naonka is psycho. Kelly b. Never did anything to nay. Never. Except for go for the same clue. <br/>I know that little  performance you put on after that [no audio] went down. I know about that. I just pushed you. <br/>You knocked me over? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah! <br/>But you said I don't  know why she did it. I don't have a clue. I don't like you. <br/>Okay, whatever. Nay's a bully. I can't think of anything else to call someone who knocks you over. I don't know if she's worried about me finding something out there, but she  wanted a reaction out of me, I wasn't going to give it to her but at the same  time it's really hard to, like, contain yourself. <br/>You're in the outs. I'm not with you, so... Why am I on the outs? <br/>I don't feel like I  need to explain anything. <br/>I didn't do anything. <br/>I don't feel like I  need to explain anything to you. I really don't need no charity case on the jury, because for sure, for sure,  she will not vote for me to get the million dollars. Continue looking. <br/>Why do you feel that  way? <br/>Good luck looking for  it. Torturing Kelly B. Mentally might even force her to just quit the game. And screw your leg. Screw your leg. Keep it away from the fire. <br/>You know, we're  getting through it, and, quite frankly, I couldn't spend ten days with no  food with my family out here without killing one of them, so I think we're  doing really good. <br/>I think we are,  'cause it's been... It doesn't get much tougher than this, guys. <br/>Yeah, it's huge. We're doing good, and we're only going to get better as time moves forward, I  think. What...? Any other observations other than...? <br/>No, I just think, for  the challenge, I think it's important to have... Either, for the most part,  one voice that's going to delegate who's going to do which parts of the  challenge, and I think, you know, the person that's stuck out the most, I  think, in terms of contribution or whatever, has been Tyrone. So, if you want to do it, I would nominate you to do it, and we've got to  fall in line and just make sure that everyone listens and is okay with that,  um... You know, I'm just  listening in, and it's tough for me. As you guys know, I've snapped on several other occasions. I bark once in a while. I'm a leader where I come from, I like to be a leader, but in this situation,  I really don't want to be the leader, and I'm willing to accept that. I'm going to snap once in a while, and say, "Play me! Play me!" but if you don't, that's fine, I can accept that. And I'm willing to just play my role. <br/>It's not like... Right. <br/>You know, we go in  the thing and nobody says anything... I'm always giving my  opinion. <br/>If you think you're  really good at one part of it, say, "Okay, I'm ready, I'll be the guy to  take a puzzle on." or whatever. <br/>Marty's definitely  not a big Jimmy T. Fan. It has to stem from insecurities, 'cause I'm an easygoing guy. You know, he wants ultimate control, and nobody say anything, and any time I  try to give some input, he tries to mildly, humbly shoot it down. <br/>So I don't know about  doing deep, deep assessments about, you know, hey, "What do you do the  40 in? And who does, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. <br/>A couple times, I'd  like to tell Marty, "Will you shut up, you preppy little bitch? You wouldn't last a minute in my world." But people should say  what they feel they're good at or whatever, and then, you got to be the  tie-breaker. <br/>I've got to give him  a little shake. "Marty! Get a clue!" hey, but maybe once I lose it, that's the next thing I'll  do. [ã    \monkey howlingã    ] Tree mail. "Life, home and family, tribal togetherness and trust. "Only team work can win warmth and comfort or your efforts will be a  bust." Oh, yeah. <br/>Blindfold. Uh-oh. <br/>Blindfold. Somebody's going to have to guide. <br/>Oh. <br/>We should practice. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Just to get used to  being blindfold... Being blindfolded. <br/>...And taking  direction and walking blind out there. <br/>You know, if we get  all used to those directions, when you give the directions, we'll know  exactly what you mean. <br/>Uh, Jill, ten steps  straight ahead. Dan, 15 steps straight ahead. Yeah, we've got to get the "W," and the other tribe is not a factor  to me. Jill, stop. Jill, right two. Dan, stop. Dan, right three. And I'm confident that if we give 110% of our best effort, which is  discipline and listening, I think we'll do better, because we're typically  more disciplined. We're older. <br/>Everybody, when he  gives the instruction, right, he's going to give 15 steps in whatever  direction, you got to do that and you got to stop without him saying stop. <br/>Yes. <br/>Because then he's  going to go to the next person, and you're gonna be... 'cause you can't just  wait and work on one person. You got to be multitasking. <br/>I nominated Tyrone  last night as the leader for the challenge, and, by the way, I knew it would  rile Jimmy T. You know, he's like a three-year-old. <br/>You know what I'm  saying? <br/>J.T. Is delusional. He has no idea. He suffers from both paranoia and from delusions of grandeur. <br/>He doesn't need to  tell you... Don't turn in that  direction... Jane, well, do  whatever instruction he does, and then, we automatically stop and wait for  the next instruction. <br/>Anybody that calls  out Jimmy Johnson, and says that Jimmy Johnson might be insecure because of Jimmy  T.'s leadership capabilities has got some issues going on. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys! Younger tribe getting your first look at the new older tribe. Jimmy johnson voted out at the last tribal council. [gasping] all right, you guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: First things  first. I will take back immunity. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, one person from each tribe will be your caller. The rest of the tribe will be blindfolded and paired up. Using only verbal commands, the caller will direct their tribe mates to  collect ten items scattered in the field. Once you have all ten items back, the caller will then direct one pair out to  find a set of keys. Those keys will unlock a chest. First tribe to get their chest and all ten items back to the start wins  immunity, is safe from the vote. In addition, you are playing for reward. The winning tribe will choose three groups of items from sears. You have a massive tool kit, tarp, rope, knife, a complete fishing kit. <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: All right, now  let's get to the medallion of power. Younger tribe, you still have it. If you use it in today's challenge, your advantage will be to begin with two  items already back at your starting mat. Give you a minute to figure out if you want to use it. <br/>I think that we  should use it. <br/>Use it. <br/>Jeff: Younger tribe,  what's it going to be? <br/>I think we're going  to use it. <br/>Gonna use it. Benry, give it to somebody from the older tribe. Older tribe now has the medallion of power and will get a chance to use it at  a future challenge. This challenge runs with only seven tribe members. Older tribe, you're sitting one person out. Who's it going to be? <br/>Daniel. <br/>Daniel. <br/>Jeff: Daniel's gonna  sit out for the older tribe? Younger tribe, you're sitting out two people. Who's it going to be? <br/>The two kellys. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: All right,  sit-outs, take a seat on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategies. We'll get started. All right, for the younger tribe, Brenda is the caller. For the older tribe, Tyrone is the caller. Younger tribe starting with two items already on their mat. Means they only have to collect eight items. For immunity and reward, Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Group one, two,  three, get going! <br/>Jill, 20 straight. <br/>You're going all the  way down. <br/>J.T., 20 straight. <br/>Group two to four,  group three to your right. Group three to you right. <br/>Aah! <br/>Group three, right. <br/>Keep going straight  all of you. Keep going straight. <br/>Jill, stop! Left three. <br/>Jeff: Everybody  blindfolded. <br/>Group two, stop where  you are, group one... Jeff: Everybody  trying to get their bearings. <br/>Hey, stop! Team, stop! Turn around! Reverse. Forward. Three. <br/>Group three, forward. Feel that, feel that on your left. <br/>Reverse! <br/>Get the tarp! It's on your left! Everyone, stop! <br/>Jill, forward. Three. <br/>Group three, get...  Yes, yes! Come back... Jimmy t., left, five! <br/>Group two to your  left... Jeff: Brenda very  calm as she directs the younger tribe. <br/>Stop! Stop, Jill! Put your hands down. <br/>Go three, yes, two,  yes. All three, come back. <br/>Objective to the  right. Objective right! Come back, Yve, reverse. Reverse. <br/>All three come back... Jeff: The younger  tribe off to a quick start. Three items, racing back. <br/>Come on. <br/>Go back. <br/>Jeff: Younger tribe  started with an advantage of two items. Naonka and Alina with the fifth item for the younger tribe. Older tribe coming back with their first item. Marty takes a fall. <br/>Yve, stop! Grab it. Turn around! Come back, Yve! <br/>All three keep going! <br/>Come straight back,  blue! <br/>Chase, on your  left-hand side. <br/>Aah! <br/>Chase, on your left. Chase, grab the top! <br/>I got it. Brenda?! <br/>Yes! Bring it back, yes! Yes! <br/>Stop it... Jeff: Older tribe  with their first item. Younger tribe coming back with their sixth item. <br/>Stop! <br/>Drop it! Go to your left. <br/>Jimmy t., back up. Back up, Jimmy T., three. <br/>Make sure... Jimmy, that's it. Grab it! Grab it! Turn around! <br/>Is this one? <br/>Stop, drop it, Jill. <br/>Jeff: Marty and Jill  drop the second item for the older tribe. <br/>Alina, you got it. Bring that back. <br/>Yve, stand up, turn  right three... Jeff: Seven items for  the younger tribe. <br/>20's great, Jimmy T. <br/>Go back on your left. <br/>Hey, I got a tarp! <br/>Yes, ben, yes! Bring it back! Bring it back! <br/>Fabio, she said yes! <br/>Oh! <br/>Jill, Jill, five  forward. Go Jill! <br/>Jeff: Yve and Jane  coming back with another item for the older tribe. That's three items for the older tribe. That's the eighth item for the younger tribe. Two items left. Younger tribe with a huge lead. <br/>Jimmy t., right! Jimmy t., right! <br/>I got to go this way. Come this way. <br/>Jeff: Nine items for  the younger tribe. <br/>Drop it there. Sash, bring that back! <br/>Over here. <br/>Bring that back down! <br/>Is it this here? <br/>Bring it back. Yes! <br/>Go. <br/>Sash, bring it back! <br/>Jeff: Sash and Chase  have the tenth and final item for the younger tribe! <br/>Drop it. Drop it. <br/>Jeff: Jimmy T. And Holly drop the fourth item for the older tribe. <br/>Go straight. Stop, Jill! Turn left three. Straight! No, left, Jill. Stop. <br/>Jeff: Yve and Jane  with five for the older tribe. <br/>Go back out, stop. <br/>Jeff: Younger tribe  has all ten items. Now they've got to find the set of keys... Go to the keys. <br/>Jeff: ...To unlock  the chest. <br/>Go to your left, Chase! To your left! <br/>Yve, stop! <br/>Jeff: Older tribe in  huge trouble right now. <br/>Yve, go right! <br/>Is he talking to us? <br/>Jimmy t., go right! <br/>Move to your left! To your left! To your left! Get the tree! Yes, yes, yes, yes! <br/>Jimmy t., go right 20! <br/>Jeff: Sash and Chase  have the keys to the chest now. <br/>Keep going forward! The chest is in front of you. <br/>Yve! Yve, turn around, stop. <br/>There you go, unlock  it. <br/>Jeff: Holly, Jimmy T. Have been wandering... Stop, Jimmy T.! Stop, jimmy! <br/>Jeff: ...For a long  time with no idea... Jimmy, stop! Damn, that boy don't listen! Jimmy t.! <br/>Jeff: Younger tribe  has their block undone. <br/>Bring it back to me. <br/>Jeff: Younger tribe  has the chest. They're heading back for the win! <br/>Yve, stop moving! Yve! <br/>Jeff: Older tribe in  complete disarray. All over the place. <br/>Go right! Turn right! <br/>Keep going straight. <br/>Jimmy t... Here! Up here! On the platform! On the platform! <br/>Jeff: Younger tribe  wins immunity and reward! [ã    \cheers and applauseã    ] When I was over  there, I couldn't hear you over everybody else screaming and yelling, so...  [cheering] Jeff: Younger tribe,  congratulations. Immunity once again. [ã    \applauseã    ] in addition, you now get to select  three groups of items from sears to take with you back to camp. What are the three groups? <br/>Fishing, the tarp and  the cooking supplies. <br/>All right, come get  your items. Put them in your crate. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: All right,  older tribe, tribal council tonight. Somebody will be the fourth person voted out of this game. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I will see you at tribal. <br/>It was really tough. I mean, it wasn't easy, you know? And I don't know if I was in it I don't think it would have mattered. You know, it was just tough. It was just tough. I know I'm not good on mud so I'm not a mudder, but, you know, the power of  the medallion really did it. <br/>Yeah, and that alone  says something about us, you know? They needed an advantage to beat us. <br/>Um, it's good to sit  here and say well, we did good, we did good. But, look, I'm going to continue to ask to get a little action. I think I can contribute. I'm... I've coached basketball teams and I've coached crews, I continue to  coach children on a regular basis. I think I can be a leader in immunity challenges and I'd like that  opportunity. <br/>So today do you feel  like you you would have been more valuable somewhere else? <br/>Um, probably not. I'm just looking for an opportunity to help this team win. I've been successful in the past and I can be successful in the future. I just want a fair opportunity. Doesn't even get an equal opportunity? <br/>Jimmy t., he's  digging his own hole. Every time we have a challenge he's very negative afterwards. Very negative he says "All I want is a shot. "I can get in there, I can make some things, I've coached." you  know, start giving me his resume. Bottom line is he's very much about him and it's becoming more and more clear  and the comments today I didn't dig at all. <br/>What! <br/>A lot of gear in  there. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Good job, everybody. Good job. <br/>God bless sears. <br/>What a win. <br/>New knives. <br/>Yeah we have a whole  knife set. <br/>A whole knife set. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>What we wanted most! [cheers and applause] a tarp, baby! Whoo! <br/>We can sleep now. <br/>As soon as I opened  the tackle box I saw a rolled up piece of paper. I knew it was a clue and as soon as I saw that I shut it. <br/>Let's have a little  watermelon celebration. Everyone else went over and looked at the tarp or whatever they were looking  at, I didn't care. I grabbed the note, folded it up, put it in my pocket and... Brenda is a very  close ally of mine. I'd probably trust her more than anyone out here. I have a clue in my pocket. <br/>What? <br/>Yep. I'm telling you that because I trust you, you know? <br/>I know, I know. So now what? <br/>Now we look for it. Dig eight yards left of tree-mail. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Let's go. <br/>If we can get this  idol, we're gold. <br/>Chase found the third  clue. He figured out where it should be if it was there and I just felt so bad  because he is my buddy. Do you trust nay? <br/>Do you trust her? <br/>I trust her. <br/>You do? <br/>Do you trust me? <br/>I trust you. <br/>Who do you trust more? <br/>You. <br/>Like how much more? <br/>I trust you more than  anyone here. <br/>Good. Well, then I've got to tell you something. <br/>What? It's either eight yards that way or eight yards west. Do you want to look at the clue? <br/>Okay, this is the  thing. You're not listening to me. <br/>Go ahead. <br/>Okay. Um... So if nay for whatever reason confided in me because she really does  trust me and I trust her. <br/>Why are you worried? <br/>Because I am trying  to keep my trust with the person who has the immunity idol. <br/>Someone has the  immunity idol? Who? Nay? <br/>Yeah. But I found it for her. <br/>You swear to me? <br/>I swear to you. <br/>You guys found it? <br/>I swear to you we  found it. <br/>You can not trust  anyone in this game but sometimes you have to. Naonka and I don't have a great trust but we do have Brenda between us, you  know? So as long as nay's not coming after me, then that's fine. Can I do this? <br/>What? <br/>Can I go up to nay  and be like... You don't have to say  anything. Seriously. You don't have to say anything. If word gets out that I told Chase, nay won't trust me anymore because I... I  betrayed her trust. Which is big because she's the one with the idol. You have to understand my position. She has it. So if I betray her, we're all-- me, you-- are all screwed up. <br/>Not a lot of sea  urchins here. <br/>That's a big one,  isn't it? <br/>Yeah good enough. You can get something out of that. <br/>Oh, we're digging  around for sea urchins. We're really hurting for food and this is about it. You get tiny little glop of salty protein. But it's really good. They actually are just a bit of flavor and yeah, we're down to sea urchins  now. <br/>Marty, you're not  contributing to the company pot? <br/>I just grabbed two or  three of the little tiny ones. <br/>Two or three over  here, two or three over there then two or three over there. What about the rest of the team? Come on, man, be a tribe player. <br/>Not gonna go there  with you, buddy. You guys can eat all the ones you caught. <br/>All right. Just want to make sure you're doing the right thing. <br/>Appreciate that. Trying to call me out as a non-team player because I ate a couple sea urchins  and I didn't contribute sea urchins to his net, he just doesn't get this game. You do that, that's the perfect way to ensure your destiny in this game. <br/>Oh, back there he was  like... Oh, with the... You eating the  urchins all by yourself. I just want to make sure you're a team player. Give me a break. <br/>You are. Don't worry, you are. <br/>Of course I know that. So Jimmy T. Trying to tell me that I'm not a team player and calling it out in front of  the whole tribe? That's the equivalent of putting a gun to your mouth, pulling the trigger and  blowing your brains out as far as I'm concerned. <br/>I'm going to write Danny's  name down. I don't want to but I'm going to. I think he's been hitting around. He's had enough. Don't you? I'm going to hate losing Danny because I love his little one-liners. <br/>So do I. <br/>I mean, I do. <br/>So you think that's  who you'll vote for? <br/>Yeah. Because that's what coach put down and I think coach was sending a message to  us to vote the next weakest link out. <br/>Honestly I think  we'll keep Dan around after today. He always sits out. <br/>We have to. We have to. It's critical. He's our swing vote. <br/>I don't think I've  got 28 more days of this in me. <br/>Just take it one day  at a time. Take it one day at a time. But Jimmy T. For sure, right? Correct? <br/>Whatever you say. <br/>We've got to work on Tyrone,  okay? That's the key, right? <br/>I'll talk to him. <br/>The main thing is  that Danny does not go home. I tried to drill that into Jill. I think she gets it. Do I wish Danny was stronger and better? It would be great but after tonight people will understand it doesn't matter  what they want to say about whether Danny's weak and why am I protecting him. <br/>Stuff's too wet. <br/>It will be numbers. Numbers speak for themselves and the numbers will dictate the outcome of the  next three tribals and I know I can count on him. I know I can count on him. <br/>Hey, look at this. <br/>Would you stop? <br/>Can you help me untie  the shoes? <br/>Jimmy t. Drives us all crazy. He drives everybody crazy in camp. It's just... It's annoying as all hell and if I don't have to listen to him  at any more tribal councils, it will be a blessing. <br/>I don't know. It's a tossup between Danny and Jimmy T. <br/>If I'd give you my  druthers I'd pick Jimmy T. <br/>Okay, given my druthers  I'd pick Dan because everything is... Everything requires something. Dan's having a hard time walking. You know what I mean? I help him through everything. Yeah, he's a great guy and he's still going to be a great guy but you're not...  You know, helping our cause right now. <br/>Right. <br/>Honestly, I want Dan  to go but he's... Because I've always been for a strong team but he's  intrinsic to my alliance so I'm not sure I can do that. I mean, I love Dan but he's definitely the guy who sits every game so what are  you going to do? <br/>Did he say anything? <br/>He wants Dan. <br/>He wants what? <br/>Dan. He thinks Dan's weak. He's all about a strong team. I don't know that I can swing him so I don't know. <br/>I don't want to vote Danny  out. I'm telling you. Are you leaning towards one or the other right now? <br/>Yeah. It's kind of crazy. I don't know. I guess Danny was my first thought. His knees, he can't run in the mud. Everything we've done has been in the mud to some degree, you know? <br/>A little bit, yeah, I  hear you. I just think sometimes there's things that are just wrong, you know what I  mean? It's like a cancer. To be honest, right now I'd rather have Jimmy T. Gone. And I feel pretty strongly about having somebody that's that volatile and  that loose. And it's pushing the boundaries of my patience but, um, yeah, his plea, his  biggest feedback after the challenge today was that he wants to be the  leader, basically, is what he's saying. The guy's a train wreck. I can't believe he could lead anything. <br/>Yeah. <br/>All I want is a shot  at one challenge. One shot; one challenge. That's all. I don't want to be leader. <br/>What would you have  done differently? <br/>I'm not saying I  would have done anything different or I could have won today. I just would have liked the opportunity. The question is why aren't I getting the chance? Why is everybody saying hey, let me get a chance. No, no, no. Why is that? <br/>You know, sometimes  silence is a little bit more powerful than speaking and it's a social game,  too, and I know j.T. Appears verbally to be secure but he's insecure. <br/>I've got to be me. I'm going to continue to say "Please can I have my chance?" And when someone of  that stature and that accomplishment doesn't trust he's enough, is he... I  can't trust he's going to be enough down the road. <br/>Anyway, thanks for  listening. I... Send me your therapy bill and I appreciate you hearing me. <br/>I'm a mother and I  don't coddle my kids that much. <br/>You never know in  this game. I'm scared it might be me because I keep opening my mouth. I'm getting a little messy. Can you pass me the napkins, please? But of course every time I open my mouth about "Put me in, coach"  it falls on deaf ears. They don't talk much to me. I get very little out of them. That's what feeds my fuel of feeling like I'm all alone on a planet here. It's a tough group of people to get along with. And I'm easy to get along with, I think. <br/>Jeff: Tyrone, let's  talk about today's challenge. What happened? <br/>Today we went with  our plan. Worked out well. I think the medallion of power... Jeff: Wait. Your plan for today's challenge worked out well? <br/>Well, provided the  medallion of power wasn't in the play I think it would have been a much more  competitive challenge. <br/>Jeff: Marty, is that  your take as well? <br/>Yeah, we had one more  item to go, they had two to start out with so at the very least it would have  been a close match or we could have had a leg up. <br/>Jeff: To be clear,  you had one more item, a set of keys, a chest, three locks and getting it  back. <br/>You know what? It's behind us; we've got to move forward. Fixing what we can at camp, that's the mental attitude you have to have. <br/>Jeff: Dan, you sat  out of the challenge yet again. <br/>I told everybody on  the tribe that I do not feel comfortable because of my knee sloshing around  in mud. If you put me on level ground, I'll go up against anybody. But why would I want to do something that I know I'm not good at and possibly  hurt the tribe? <br/>Jeff: No, I wouldn't  either. But when you come to tribal council saying "I can't go because it's  muddy" when you're in the rain forest, you have to be a little worried  that maybe I'm just too much of a burden. <br/>Absolutely. Yeah, maybe I am. <br/>Jeff: Do you believe  you are? <br/>No. If I think I'm making the proper choice of sitting down, that's what I'm  going to do and I'll do it again. I don't want to hurt the tribe. <br/>Jeff: Jill, how much  does that factor in for you when you think about who to vote out tonight? <br/>It's... It factors in  a lot in my thinking. I mean, I know everyone's kind of like, rah, rah, we did our best, but I'm  tired of losing. I'm not used to losing. I don't like it. We've gone through an n.F.L. Coach and all this stuff and we're still not winning challenges and it's  bugging me. <br/>Jeff: Jimmy T., Jill  mentions you've been through an n.F.L. Coach, got rid of him. How frustrating is that to not have leadership? <br/>Right. The ship is going down. We keep coming back here voting guys out, so why don't we try mixing it up? <br/>Jeff: And  "Mixing it up" would mean what? <br/>Everybody knows I've  been vocal in wanting one opportunity to lead the tribe in an immunity  challenge, but I continue to be the squeaky wheel that doesn't get the oil. <br/>Jeff: Marty, why not  give Jimmy T. A shot? Are you open to it? <br/>Not necessarily, no. I mean, I think as a tribe, we thought that Tyrone should be the guy calling  the shots. I don't think it's always necessarily some incredible leadership quality. I mean, we had Jimmy Johnson for... Sake. It doesn't get any better than that when you talk about leadership. You've got a stressful situation here. There is zero tolerance for paranoia, delusions of grandeur, popping off. Everyone right now is trying to be as patient as possible, but it's been  stretched to the limit. <br/>Jeff, I'm offering. They don't want to accept, that's fine. But what kind of success is Espada tribe having right now? <br/>Jeff: very little. <br/>Case closed. <br/>You know, can I say  something? All he's asking for is a chance. Let him try. How do you know that the sixth person on the bench doesn't have the ability  as the first person on the bench if you don't give him a chance? That's the way I look at it. <br/>Listen, I'm a  valuable contributor to the tribe. I provide food. I try to provide comfort, but evidently they don't see me the same light I  see me. <br/>Jeff: Tyrone, if you  believed Jimmy T. Could change, if you believed it was possible, would he have value to the  tribe? <br/>Yeah. He has value now as it is even though he's not a follower. He would have more value if he was, you know, able to be a follower. <br/>Jeff: Okay. So Jimmy T., are you willing to accept the role that this tribe clearly wants  you to have, which is as a follower, not a leader? <br/>I'm man enough. I believe I'm man enough. And maybe... Maybe they don't believe so, but I'm man enough to take my role  and take some good advice. <br/>Jeff: Is this hard? <br/>Very hard for me. <br/>Jeff: Why does it  hurt so much? I can see you're emotional. <br/>Give me a minute. <br/>I say take this as an  opportunity to have the courage to acknowledge that, hey, maybe there is  something that I can do to be a better me and move forward from there. <br/>Jeff: Jimmy T., from  all guys, Tyrone extending the olive branch. <br/>I think they know I'm  a man of honor. I know I'm a man of honor and integrity. If I say I'm going something, I'm gonna honor that. So I'll step down and say I'll just be a worker bee for this tribe and a good  worker bee and nobody can deny that. <br/>Jeff: Well, a lot has  been said at tonight's tribal council. The question is, how will it impact the vote? It is time to vote. Holly, you're up. <br/>Sorry about your  shoes, but you sat out two challenges. You're the weak one on the team. You need to go. <br/>See ya, pal. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally  the votes. <br/>Jeff: Once the votes  are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Dan. Dan. Two votes Dan. Dan. That's three votes Dan. Jimmy t. Three votes Dan, one vote Jimmy T. Jimmy t. That's three votes Dan, two votes Jimmy T. Jimmy t. We're tied, three votes Dan, three votes Jimmy T. Jimmy t. That's four votes Jimmy T., three votes Dan, one vote left. Fourth person voted out of Survivor: Nicaragua, Jimmy T. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Jeff: Jimmy T., the  tribe has spoken. Well, it seems pretty clear that tonight's vote was an attempt to improve the  chemistry of this tribe. Let's hope it worked, because something has got to change. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from out next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on Survivor...  Naonka becomes her own worst enemy. <br/>Still hurting? <br/>It's killing me. <br/>Jeff: And Marty's  million-dollar dream ride... It would take  something extraordinary, completely whacked out to disturb my plan. <br/>Jeff: ...Grinds to a  halt. Drop your buffs. It is a brand new game. <br/>I was definitely not  counting on this. <br/>Yeah, I totally blew  my game. It's my own fault. I planned on keeping my mouth shut and that went right out the window. I think Marty's the puppet master and he's pulling all the strings right. He's playing with his head. I played with my heart. Definitely outwitted me. That's what you've got to do in this game. I just really feel like I blew a tremendous opportunity. I really feel like I let people down.
