<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: Courtney grew closer to Frosti...  Frosti's my little munchkin, and he's a doll face. <br/>Probst: ...which made Todd question her loyalty to the Fei Long alliance. <br/>It's scary. It really is, because you never know if she's going to want to twist or turn. <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge... You will be divided into two teams of four. ...Peih-Gee's team dropped the ball. James too hard, Peih-Gee can't get it. And Erik's team won an unforgettable trip. Frosti, Amanda, Erik and Courtney, cruising down the Lee River. <br/>All right, everyone, cheers to us. <br/>Probst: During the cruise, Courtney and Amanda vented about Peih-Gee. <br/>She's too intense right now, and I don't like that. <br/>She's made a series of poor decisions. <br/>Probst: And back at camp, Peih-Gee blamed James for losing Peih-Gee blamed  James for losing the challenge... the challenge... ...making her first in  line to be voted out. <br/>Peih-Gee, she's just stupid. <br/>Probst: But at the immunity challenge... Peih-Gee wins immunity. ...Peih-Gee narrowly beat Frosti. With Peih-Gee immune, the former Fei Long saw Frosti as the biggest threat. <br/>He has to go. <br/>Probst: And although James had the only two hidden immunity idols, he felt  confident that he wouldn't have to use them. <br/>It makes no sense for us to mess it up now, because it's right there. <br/>Probst: And at tribal council, his gamble paid off-- James received no votes. Ninth person voted out and the third member of our jury, Frosti. And Courtney lost a friend. And Courtney lost a friend. Frosti, the tribe has spoken. Frosti, the tribe has spoken. All right.

Jury, it doesn't involve you. Jury, it doesn't involve you. You can head out. You can head out. Okay, we've just finished tribal council. Frosti was just voted out, became the third member of our jury. There are now only seven of you left. Tonight, you're not going directly back to camp... because you're going to  participate in a reward challenge right here at tribal council. <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>Thank you! <br/>Probst: But this is no ordinary reward. The winner of the challenge will travel by private jet hundreds of miles into  the Sungshan mountains to a place where few outsiders have ever been invited  to stay, the Shaolin Temple. This is an incredible rare privilege. Built in the Fifth Century, the Shaolin Temple is most famous for being home  to kung fu. You'll enjoy a kung fu demonstration, a vegetarian meal. You will then spend the night in the temple before returning to camp in the  morning. Big relief, James? <br/>A little one. <br/>Probst: In the midst of a crazy game, this truly is an opportunity that very  few people in the world will ever experience. The winner of this challenge will also choose two people to go with them. Let's get to it. This reward challenge starts This reward challenge starts right now. right now.

Okay. So everybody's going to go back to camp together. Try and get a little sleep, because you're leaving very early in the morning,  Peih-Gee, Erik, and Denise. Have a good time. Grab your torches, head back to camp. camp. Good night, guys. Good night, guys. <br/>Hey, guys, the boat. <br/>Go eat a lot of food. <br/>You guys don't have too much fun here without us. <br/>We'll do our best. <br/>Peih-Gee picked me to see the Shaolin Temple. I got such love right now for her. But here I am, I'm going off with Peih-Gee and Erik. I'm concerned because sometimes when you leave camp you don't know what's  going on, and when you come back, you don't know what to expect. That makes me very, very nervous. <br/>Bye, guys. <br/>Have fun. Run, Erik, run! <br/>Bye, guys. <br/>Hey, I think we should eat a lot today. lot today. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>It will be nice to have the four of us chilling in a big four of us chilling  in a big bed, eating good food. bed, eating good food. This is what I want. This is what, like, a nine-day advance sneak preview? We all know that, which I think we're okay with. When Denise, Peih-Gee, and Erik left for their reward, we were all kind of  like, "Oh, this is nice to have the four of us. It could be this way. We could keep it this way." We could keep it this way." And there  was no arguing. And there was no arguing. <br/>Right now, the four of us are in the proverbial Garden of Eden. The Lord said, "Don't bite that apple." If Eve would have listened,  they would be frolicking naked in heaven. I just want us to frolic naked as long as we can. So don't be tempted by Peih-Gee and Erik. Don't bite the apple. Leave it alone. <br/>We're in the top seven, soon to be top four. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Right now, I'm just kind of going along with everyone, saying "Yeah,  we're top four. Whoo-hoo!" But in all reality, I don't feel comfortable going to the  final three with any of them. This is the time in the game that a change needs to be made. This is my chance to make something else happen the way I something else  happen the way I want it to happen. want it to happen. <br/>Whoo-hoo! <br/>Yeah! <br/>You ever been on a private jet? <br/>I've never been on, like, a charter jet before. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>It was a ridiculous contrast, because we're still, like, in crazy rags and we  stink. <br/>Here we are sitting in the lap of luxury like millionaires eating. <br/>You and I didn't have to win. <br/>Exactly. <br/>Peih-Gee graced us. <br/>Whoo-hoo! <br/>Thank you for having us. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>Here's to us flying high in the skies. <br/>Living large. <br/>You guys realize that after last night, we could be final three? Right now, the three of us, that's three votes. There's only seven people left. We could get James to go with us. That's four of us. That would be the majority. We could pick off... who would it be, Todd? What do you think about that? <br/>You never know what's going to happen, though. That's what this game is all about. <br/>Peih-Gee is working her strategy. She needs to do whatever she can to get further along in this game. Peih-Gee and Erik are definitely on the outsides, but you don't want to make  enemies, so, I mean, we're just going to have to wait and see what happens at  to wait and see what happens at this point. this point. <br/>Welcome to Shaolin Temple. <br/>Being Chinese, it was really great to be able to experience something that up  until now had kind of been, like, a separate foreign world to me. I mean, a 1,500-year-old Shaolin temple, and it's huge. You could see monks playing music, some meditating. You know, these are, like, Shaolin monks and they're renowned for their martial  arts prowess. <br/>Yeah, I've been actually taking karate classes and I opened my own school. My black belt is coming up. My black belt is coming up. <br/>Cool. <br/>Cool. <br/>Eight years. So just... I started when I was 32, and I'm 40 now. 32, and I'm 40 now. So still a student. So still a student. Some might say. Not me yet. Out of all the rewards that have come up, this is the one I wanted to go on  the most. The Shaolin Temple. It's 1,500 years old. I mean, just to look around and see over 1,000 years of culture and the  beginnings of the actual martial arts themselves is just so incredible for me. so incredible for me. It's just an amazing thing. It's just an amazing thing. The demonstration was fantastic. I mean, it takes years of practice just to get a single form down, and these  guys were form down, and these guys were doing it with hardly any effort. doing it with hardly any effort. <br/>After the main kung fu exhibition, the cutest kids came out. Denise and Peih-Gee and I were allowed to go down, and they allowed to go  down, and they were teaching us some moves. were teaching us some moves. <br/>Going to burn off those  Going to burn off those cookies. cookies. <br/>Are you getting this, Denise? <br/>Are you getting this, Denise? You're getting it for sure. You're getting it for sure. <br/>A little demonstration. <br/>Sure, put me on the spot. <br/>Sure, put me on the spot. <br/>Yeah, that's right. <br/>Yeah, that's right. <br/>It was cool to see Denise do  It was cool to see Denise do that karate. that karate. I was impressed. I was, like, "No way. I was, like, "No way. Denise, who knew?" Denise, who knew?"  At this point, I could not thank Peih-Gee enough for picking me for this  reward. To take that experience back home for the rest of my life, there's no words  to really there's no words to really describe that. describe that. <br/>Wow! Do we just dig in? <br/>I guess so. <br/>We've forgotten what to do with food. <br/>Oh, that's good. <br/>That's sweet and sour, huh? <br/>Mmm! Oh, my god. It's so good. We've been squatting on logs eating out of, like, dirty utensils. So, like, suddenly we're ushered into this, like, magical setting in the  middle of the temple courtyard. I mean, it was... it was really, really cool. What did you think of that demonstration, huh? In those guys are crazy out there. <br/>That was cool, huh? <br/>It was so awesome. <br/>I've never seen anything like that. <br/>It's an amazing reward. Oh, my god, this is our room, you guys. <br/>Beautiful. <br/>This is really cool. <br/>Good night. Thank you for such a good day. <br/>Good night. <br/>Good night. <br/>We got to sleep in, like, a little temple room, and they set up mats. And, I mean, it was just... it was crazy. Like, you couldn't... I don't think you could, like, pay to do think you  could, like, pay to do something like that. something like that. My neck is still on the line. People still want me out. But being at the temple, it really gives me inspiration, you know, for me to  really to keep know, for me to really to keep on truckin'. on truckin'. <br/>Yeah. <br/>This rainstorm is hell. When you're sitting in a muddy hole in a swimming suit that you've been  wearing for a month, crammed, hunched over like this, looking out, praying  for the clouds to go away... I'm done with the rain, done. with the rain, done. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. <br/>They're back. <br/>They're back. <br/>When we came back to camp this afternoon, there was nobody around, and I  didn't understand where everybody was. Amanda came out to greet everybody. Nobody's going to come out to greet Peih-Gee and Erik. <br/>Hey. How was your kung fu? <br/>It was pretty sweet. <br/>It was? <br/>Yeah, it was really cool. <br/>That's cool. <br/>Where is everybody, in the cave? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Hey, guys. I won't lie. It was, like, pretty cool. The three of us, we had this great experience. We get back here, and it is, like, a mess. And, obviously, they're like miserable rats here. miserable rats here. <br/>So what did you guys do? <br/>So what did you guys do? <br/>You flew somewhere? <br/>Yeah. <br/>It was pretty cool. It was, like, a little small jet and we had pistachios and a bottle of  champagne. We get there and we walked around and they showed us a bit around and they  showed us a bit of the stuff. of the stuff. <br/>You're lying. Chocolate? <br/>No, they were, like, pecan sandies. <br/>I was about to push you back in the mud. <br/>The cave was the best thing I have right now. The cave is my happy place. What I don't want, like, is everyone and their damn mother decides that they  like the cave, too. It's like, you know, Peih-Gee comes sidling up in there. And I'm like, "I'm going to kill you." And then you want to start  talking about... no, get out of here. Get out. No talking in the cave. <br/>We're all really happy that you guys got to go, especially you guys got to  go, especially you... you...  Man. Man. Peih-Gee is not my idea of fun. She is annoying as hell. She goes to Denise and is like, "We should vote out Todd, dah, dah,  dah." And I'm thinking, "Bitch, do you expect anybody to get up on  your side? Anybody?" Good job, because now I hate your guts. Thank you. Thank you. <br/>Oh, no! <br/>Oh, no! <br/>That's true. <br/>That's true. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, I get it. Erik's not that smart. If I were to go from nice happy five to the evil two... I'm not going to eat  that apple. They can tempt me all they want, but I'm just not having it. He should know that. He should know that I'm really not going to flip on nobody. not going to flip on nobody. It's pointless. It's pointless. <br/>I'm over the bamboo. <br/>I'm over the bamboo. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, gosh. "Practice, practice, practice, anyone can win this game. Arrogance breeds complacency. Remember that when you lose your flame." So we're just flinging stars at  people? Like, isn't this kind of dangerous? <br/>When we go back... I have been up all night, thinking of our situation. I have a really good idea. I have a really good idea. We get rid of James tonight. We get rid of James tonight. I do. Because the thing is, to get James out, he can't expect it, and he doesn't  expect it right now. I came up with a plan to get rid of James, because he's in control right now,  because he has the immunity idols. So he definitely has to be blindsided tonight. We're pretty much, like, just giving James a top three spot right now. And he deserves to win a million dollars. I would give James a million dollars. He's done the most around camp. He's been, like, crazy good in challenges. There's no other time to get rid of James other than right now. <br/>Okay, that sounds good. <br/>Is that a good idea? <br/>Yeah. <br/>James keeps telling everyone, "Stay away from the apple. Don't eat the apple. This is our final four, that's it." I am not only ready to bite the  apple, I am ready to make the whole frickin' pie. All we have to do is make sure All we have to do is make sure he doesn't win  immunity today. he doesn't win immunity today. he doesn't win immunity today. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Final seven. You ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: First things first, Peih-Gee, time to give it up. <br/>Oh, come back soon. <br/>Probst: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will each throw three stars at a series of  targets, each worth different points. Hit any part of the target, and get one, two, or three points. Hit the heart itself, you get five points. The three people with the highest scores at the end of the first round move  on to a sudden death round, where you only get one throw. The person with the highest score wins immunity, is safe tonight at tribal  council, guaranteed a one in-- what, Todd?--  Six! <br/>Probst: ...shot at a million dollars. We'll draw for spots, we'll get We'll draw for spots, we'll get started. started. Peih-Gee is up first. <br/>All right. <br/>Probst: Three stars. Looking to score as many points Looking to score as many points as you can. as you can. First toss, in the ground. First toss, in the ground. <br/>I suck. <br/>I suck. <br/>Probst: Peih-Gee hits the board, no score. One throw left. You need to get some points here. Oh, hits the black but bounces off.

Courtney, you're up. <br/>Come on, Court. <br/>Thanks, Amanda. <br/>Probst: One point gets you into the top three, Courtney. <br/>Well, we'll see how this goes. <br/>Probst: Courtney nails a three, moving you into second place already. <br/>Oh, a score! <br/>Good job, babe. <br/>Probst: Courtney just misses the three. You hit the two. That is five points total. And Courtney with another one. That's six. Courtney moves into the top position with Erik. Courtney now has six, Erik has six, Todd has three. Peih-Gee you're out of the running. running. James, you're up. James, you're up. Three is now the score to beat.

Oh, first throw bounces off. <br/>Come on, baby. <br/>Probst: Denise with a two. Denise, one throw left. You have only one thing you can hit, and that is the heart for hit, and that  is the heart for five. five. Oh, just misses. Bounces off, not enough for Denise. We were looking for the top three, but instead we have a top four. Amanda, James, Courtney, and Erik, all tied at six. All four will move on to the final round. final round. I'll go set it up.

Erik, come on over. <br/>Good job, Erik. <br/>Good job, man. <br/>Probst: Congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: You are safe tonight at tribal council. For the rest of you, after 30 days, this game will come to an end for one of  you. See you guys at tribal. See you guys at tribal. Head on back. Head on back. <br/>Good job, Erik. <br/>Yeah, good job. <br/>Congratulations, man. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Well, the immunity challenge was okay. I mean, Erik got the immunity. So we get rid of Peih-Gee tonight, and then after that, focus on getting rid  of Erik, and then it's all cake after and then it's all cake after that. that. <br/>Okay. <br/>We're pretty much giving James a top three position right now, because you  know everyone is going to vote for him. I guarantee you. Why don't we take control and vote him out tonight? <br/>I just worry, honestly, more about getting Erik and Peih-Gee anywhere near,  because they are the fighters. <br/>She hasn't won anything. <br/>She won two in a row! <br/>Yeah, but, see, the next challenge, if Peih-Gee has immunity, then Erik goes. If not, then Peih-Gee goes. You see what I'm saying? <br/>Yeah. <br/>What do you want to do? <br/>I will do what everybody feels most comfortable doing. doing. I don't care what that is. I don't care what that is. <br/>There is a chance that James could use the hidden immunity idol. I mean, why not, you know? If he pulls out the idol, all of our votes for James go away, so we just have  to continue to convince him that we're voting Peih-Gee out-- basically, lie  to his face, which hurts really bad, especially since I like the guy. But I like a million dollars, But I like a million dollars, too. too. <br/>I hope we can keep  I hope we can keep redeeming ourself. redeeming ourself. redeeming ourself. Erik, look at this. Erik, look at this. There's one last card I could play, which is that I'm pretty sure that James  has the immunity idol. So I'm going to try. I'm still going to talk to them and see. I don't want to go out without a I don't want to go out without a fight, you  know? fight, you know? <br/>Yes. I'm not stupid, Peih-Gee. I'm not stupid, Peih-Gee. <br/>No, no, no. <br/>No, no, no. <br/>No, no, no. Peih-Gee... Peih-Gee...  I'm debating, as far as whether I would go along with Peih-Gee. On one hand, if I voted for Todd and then James gave the idol and Todd was  gone, that would be kind of good, but then I'm kind of good, but then I'm  risking a lot by doing that. risking a lot by doing that. <br/>That girl there, she's on her hustle. <br/>I know. <br/>Which I don't blame her. That's how she's supposed to be. <br/>Exactly. She knows she's leaving tonight. She knows she's leaving tonight. She knows. She knows. No, she knows. <br/>Then we go with the good stuff. Why play around with it? It's right there. <br/>I know. <br/>It's right there. <br/>I've been the main guy trying to hold this thing together, and that's what  I'm going to do. Tonight is pivotal. Tonight is pivotal. We get past tonight, I'm good. We get past tonight, I'm good. If I get a sense that somebody is going to do something they're not supposed  to do, I will play the idol. the idol. I'd have to. I'd have to. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in  Probst: We'll now bring in the members of your jury. the members of your jury. Jaime, Jean-Robert, and Frosti, voted out at the last tribal council. First thing I've got to ask-- Denise, you are beaming like I have not seen  you beam in 30 days. Tell me about the reward. <br/>It was so much fun, Jeff. The energy just from being in the temple, I mean, it just gave me such a lift. I mean, I got plenty of energy now to go the rest of the time. <br/>Probst: Peih-Gee, have you tried to penetrate this former Fei Long group? <br/>Yeah. I mean, it's still like butting against a brick wall because they're just  absolutely convinced it's numbers, it's numbers. <br/>Probst: James, for all the talk of Fei Long sticking together, Peih-Gee is  still in this game, just like you. <br/>Yes, she is. <br/>Probst: So whatever she was doing, it's working just like your strategy. <br/>It is working. I mean, she's doing what she's supposed to do. She's working hard at it. She's been working hard at it all day. But I'm like this-- it's so much easier to fight from a definite five than it  is to guess and take a chance. But as far as right now, there's still a Zhan Hu here, and you get them off. You know, why are we going to allow them to keep on losing to win, or just  slide in? <br/>That's not accurate because, after all, who has been winning individual  immunity? Oh, Erik, that's a lovely necklace you've got on. So calling us losers isn't going to make us too happy. You guys have to realize these are going to be people that eventually you're  going to want voting for you in the end, right? <br/>Probst: Todd, scale of one to ten, how important is trust? <br/>Trust is huge. I'd say probably a ten. If you don't have that necklace around your neck, you know, what else can you  do? <br/>Probst: Well, the opposite would be not trust. <br/>Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like keep your friends close, keep your enemies  closer, you know? <br/>Probst: Denise, what's your take on trust? <br/>I don't trust anybody at all. You say, "Okay, I make a pact with you," but then four other people  decide, "You know, that's not a very good pact, so we're going to take  you out before we take the other person out." You know, you never know  if it's going to be you. <br/>Probst: James, is it possible you could trust somebody at this point? <br/>It's possible in a way if you have the same strategy, if you have the same  goal with them. That's the only time you could really trust somebody. If you know that they really need you and you really need them, you all bond  together. But if not, you really can't trust anybody. <br/>Probst: Who here will admit that they're not overly concerned that it could  be them tonight? [ laughter] So after this entire tribal council, five strong, two weak,  everybody here truly feels it could be them. Peih-Gee, what do you think your odds are? There's only two Zhan Hu left, and Erik is wearing individual immunity. <br/>Hey, man, I've never harbored any illusions to the contrary. So I've never been in doubt about my place in this group.
