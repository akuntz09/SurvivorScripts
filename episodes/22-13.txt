<br/>Episode 13 -  <br/>Jeff: previously on "Survivor": The Ometepe six  learned that once they defeated the entire enemy tribe, the battle was only  beginning. Because now they had to face each other. <br/>One of us has to go to Redemption Island. <br/>Jeff: So Rob cut deals with everyone. <br/>We decide who goes when, and that's it. Brad thinks it's me and him. Natalie thinks it's me and her. As long as everybody thinks they've got a piece somewhere, I'll  be all set. <br/>Jeff: And everyone believed him. <br/>The only person I really, truly trust out here is Rob. <br/>Jeff: Meanwhile...  What are we doing right now? <br/>Jeff: Natalie and Ashley were pairing up. <br/>Natalie and I, we're hanging. <br/>Jeff: And Phillip thought he was the best bet to take to  the end. <br/>I made myself the villain so everyone in my tribe feels  that their best chance of winning against anybody is me. <br/>Jeff: Despite their different strategies, they all agreed Andrea  was the biggest threat. <br/>She's one of the strongest competitors in the game. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, the tribe banded together to  blindside the first member of their alliance. Andrea. <br/>Jeff: At Redemption Island, Andrea must face her former  ally, Matt, for a chance to get back in the game. As for the rest of the Ometepe, the easiest vote is done and  there's nowhere left to hide. <br/>And then there were five. Tribal was actually kind of enjoyable. We blindsided Andrea. <br/>Andrea was pretty confident. <br/>She had no idea. I love blindsides because in an evil way it's kind of fun to  see, like, their reaction, how shocked they are, and she was definitely  shocked. You could tell. <br/>Can Natalie and I just say we're the last girls standing? <br/>Yeah! <br/>I'm not going to lie, I'm kind of glad to see Andrea gone. I just felt like Natalie and I were always like this, and she  was kind of always on the out. I'll tell you if there's any plan to vote you out, and you tell  me, and maybe us two. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Love you. <br/>I'm kind of stuck in a bad situation just because Ashley  keeps bringing up "You're looking out for me, and I'm looking out for  her." I'm leaning towards sticking to Rob just because, like, he has  been there for me throughout this. But so has Ashley. <br/>Ashley's pRobably thinking about a way to turn the vote  against me. I've been fighting 10 years to get to this point. I'm seven days away. It might make sense to get rid of Ashley next. Things have to go just right. I've had control in this game. I just need to keep control. <br/>Hello. <br/>Hey, Redemption Island. <br/>Hello. <br/>Hi, guys. <br/>Howdy, howdy, howdy. <br/>How are you? <br/>I'm doing great, doing great. <br/>Andrea showed up at the isle of redemption. I was certainly most hurt by her considering I was like, you're  my number one, I want to take you to the top, let's go to the end, and then she  turns around and writes my name down because she's scared to make a move with  me. <br/>After being here, I'm like, you know what, I am bitter. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It feels so like...  It leaves a bad taste in your mouth. <br/>It does feel bad, doesn't it? <br/>I know, I know, and I know that you hate me and I know  that every time I come to the duel, you give me these dirty looks. <br/>I don't give you dirty looks. I just don't know why you're giving me big puppy dog eyes. Like you feel bad for me. <br/>You hate me and you like give me, like, these evil looks. <br/>I don't give you evil looks. Come on, you voted against me, and I tried to get you go with  them. <br/>You should have been a little more decisive because you  came in and were so wishy-washy. You went up and had a heart-to-heart with Rob, and was like,  "Hey, Andrea and I were planning on blindsiding you, but we're not going  to do that any more." throwing me under the bus. They're like, "What's your deal with Matt?" they're  like, "One minute you feel bad and one minute you don't feel bad."  they're like, "You... Can't make up your mind about him." and I was  like, why would Matt trust me ever again? <br/>I'm sorry for ruining your "Survivor" game and  throwing you under the bus and everything. <br/>No, it's okay. I'm here. I didn't that go much further. It was my fault. <br/>I'm about ready to hit the hay. <br/>No. Ain't got nothing. Here's where I sleep, on this board. <br/>Really? <br/>She can sleep on the ground. We merged. They kept there team, their tarp. Now it's good for her to serve what I had to go through. <br/>It's sparse living here at Redemption Island. <br/>I'd invite her to my house and I wouldn't let her sleep on  the ground. I'd have something for her to get off the ground. But she's not at my house. She's at Redemption Island. This is payback. It's a game. Rob was using you like toilet paper. He wiped his ass... [ laughter ]  Jeff: Come on in. We'll now bring in the competitors for today's duel. Matt, Mike, Ralph, and Andrea. Welcome to Redemption Island arena. Andrea, first chance to look at the five who blindsided you at  the last tribal council. Game changed suddenly for you. <br/>Year, it's just amazing to me that you can, like, look  into people's eyes and they can, like, all lie to you. I think every one of them lied to me. It's a really, like, shocking and, like, humbling experience. <br/>Jeff: You seem emotional right now. <br/>A little bit. <br/>Jeff: Do you feel betrayed? <br/>Yeah, I just-- like I really-- I, like, really trusted  people. I, like, open up to people and they tell you, and they're like--  trusting you. <br/>Jeff: well, the good news is, that all four of are you  still in this game, and one person at some point in the game is going to go  back into the game and will still have a shot at the million dollars. To get there, you have to survive today's duel. Here's how the duel works. You're going to move a handle through a long table maze. When you get to the end of the maze, you're going to use the  handle to smash a box. You'll retrieve a bag of puzzle pieces and use them to solve the  puzzle. The first three to complete their puzzle stay alive and are in  this game. The loser is out, will become a member of the jury. Once again, it is do or die. One shot. Take your spots. All right, put your hand on your handle. Here we go. Survivors ready? Go! Remember, these handles hover. Just lift it. Let it hover in there. If it's meant to go, it will. Don't panic. Just lift it. Let it hover in there. Ralph with a little bit of a lead now. Andrea right in it. Mike in it. <br/>Shoot. Okay. Damn it. <br/>Jeff: You do not want to last this long in this game and  go home on day 33 because you're in a bad mood. <br/>Gosh, okay. <br/>Jeff: Ralph making fast work of this maze, like he made it  himself. Ralph has his mate finished! He's going to start working on his puzzle. Mike doing well. Andrea still in it. Matt very calm. Not panicked at all. Ralph getting an early start on his puzzle. Ralph does not want to go home after 33 days. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Jeff: he wants back in this game. <br/>Why is it so hard! <br/>Jeff: Mike and Matt both very calm. Their time on redemption has shown them a lot of patience. <br/>Yeah, I'm, like, all frazzled. <br/>Jeff: Mike has his maze finished, untying those puzzle  pieces. Matt is finished now with his maze. Matt has his bag of puzzle pieces. Andrea very close. Andrea has her's finished. Andrea has her bag of puzzle pieces. Everybody working on their puzzle now. Ralph has had a huge head start but three people are moving on. You don't have to win this challenge. You just don't want to lose this challenge. Whatever lead Ralph had is quickly evaporating. Mike doing a nice job on his puzzle. Matt right behind. Andrea's in this. Ralph is actually the one falling behind now. <br/>Dang. <br/>Jeff: Mike is very close, but he's missing one piece. Where is it? Mike has his puzzle solved. Step back. Mike is staying alive. It is now Matt, Ralph, and Andrea. Two more people are moving on and staying alive in the quest for  one million dollars. A million dollars. You lose this challenge, your shot at the money is over. You become a member of the jury. That blows. <br/>Gosh...  Jeff: Matt has it right. Andrea has it right. Matt, Mike, and Andrea stay alive. <br/>Good job, buddy. <br/>Jeff: Ralph, unfortunately, after 33 days in this game,  your shot at the money is over. You will have a say in who wins the money, though. You're going to become the next member of the jury. Toss your buff in the urn. We'll see you at tribal council. <br/>See ya, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Good job, brother. Matt, Mike, Andrea, you live to see another day in this game. Grab your stuff. Head back to Redemption Island, and await your next opponent and  your next duel. All right, guys. You can head back to camp. <br/>I'll never give up hope and I'll never give up fight. I've got more heart than anyone out here but this Redemption  Island twist is making it even harder to make it to the end. I want Redemption Island to be over and done with so it's not a  factor anymore. <br/>You hungry, brother? <br/>Starving. Like...  I think we can make some rice. <br/>If we eat it, it's only going to take to us day 36 if we  eat three times a day. <br/>It's not like all of us are going to be here. We could have a cup because three days from now, you're going to  be less one. And two days from that, you're going to be less one. That's how you should be thinking. It's not like all of us are going to be here. <br/>I don't know how much, but I think we should eat  something, don't you? <br/>Okay. <br/>Zapatera ate too much while they were here and now we  don't have much left. Everybody's exhausted. Ease along. Try to just not exert as much energy as we can. Ashley is the only one that doesn't want to eat it, right? I don't know what it is, bro, but there's something about her I  just don't trust. <br/>Hey, bro, next immunity challenge, I say we get rid of Ashley. I'll tell you what-- Natalie will never switch over after that. <br/>She can't. She'd be too scared. <br/>I say we do it. <br/>Okay, there's a reason why Grant's coming to you. He's a big, muscular guy. And if we want him to dominate, if Mike were to come back, he  better be eating and feeling good and strong. <br/>Oh, I'll give up my portion of rice, then. Let me give my portion of rice to them. <br/>I'm not asking you to give up your portion of rice, but  you don't consume as many calories. You don't need as much food. You don't need as much energy. Think about that. <br/>Can you not get in our face and talk to us--  I'm getting ready-- I'm getting ready to get up. <br/>Just go, then. <br/>But do not get in our face and talk to us that way. <br/>Which way? <br/>In that tone of voice. <br/>You know what? I'll leave it. I'm done with it. <br/>That's the biggest load I ever heard-- we don't need to  eat because we're girls. <br/>You know what? <br/>We don't need the energy and we don't need the calories. <br/>Don't lie on me! Don't lie on me! <br/>What are you talking about a lie. <br/>You just said I said you don't need the energy. I said you don't need as much as he does and that's a fact. I didn't say that you didn't get to eat. I told you... 1,700 calories versus 3,600. That's a difference. <br/>How do you know how many calories--  Because I'm a well-read person, that's why. The average woman can survive on 1,700 calories a day. <br/>Good. Maybe I'm not average. <br/>Guess what? I don't give a... What you are. <br/>What? <br/>I really don't, I really don't. I said I don't give a-- you are. I don't give a-- you are, okay? <br/>Yeah, we can tell that you don't care...  I don't care, I don't care. I answered your question and you didn't like it. Apparently you're not prepared to argue with Boston Rob about  it. Oh, oh, but you want to argue with me all the time. I just love the fact that you guys only want to argue with me. With you two, it doesn't come an argument. <br/>Maybe we don't argue with them because they're normal. <br/>Yeah, they are normal. You want something from them. Since day one you snuggled up real nicely with them. You want to bring it out, we can talk about it, okay. The thing about me, you open up a can of [ bleep ] I will get  right in there with you and drag you down in it. If that's what you want to do, let's do it. <br/>Get out of our faces. <br/>I don't have to get out of your faces. <br/>Phillip. <br/>I'll sit right up here if you want. <br/>Phillip. <br/>Then get down. Yeah, go. <br/>Phillip, come on, dude. <br/>They piss me off, man. <br/>I know...  I tried to explain it to both of them. <br/>You explained nothing, Phillip. <br/>Psycho! <br/>Like you. <br/>He's pathetic. And he's crazy. Not the "N" word crazy. He's just crazy. <br/>You're a little princess, go get on your pageant. <br/>Psycho! <br/>Go get on miss u.S.A. <br/>Ashley and Natalie are getting too close for comfort. The best thing for me to do is to split the two of them up. <br/>He's nuts. <br/>So instead of, like, picking on one of them, he picks on  both of them. Instead of driving those two apart, he drives them closer  together. Phillip, stop making so much work for me. - How are you doing? - Good. - That was crazy. - I know. <br/>Are you okay? <br/>What are you thinking? I'm scared. <br/>Don't be scared. All you have to do, is you just have to do what I say, okay? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Keep Ashley happy. If you hear her mention anything about some kind of plan that  doesn't involve getting Phillip out then we need to talk. <br/>I'm for sure that she wants Phillip out. <br/>She wants Phillip out. I know. <br/>She's freaking out that you're going to go for her. <br/>Yeah, well, we are going to go for her, maybe. -I don't know. - Really? <br/>Because Grant is very skeptical about Ashley's actions,  you know. And Grant wants to get Ashley out. <br/>Okay, well--  It doesn't make sense. I know. But just-- just trust me this. Like, I know and Ashley have been friends this whole game. I promise you I will get you to the end. I promise you. <br/>Natalie and I, you know, we've stuck together since the  beginning. And the thing with Natalie is she's really relying on Rob a lot. And I rely on Rob, but I also know that he's playing the game. And I would bet my life if it came down to Grant, me, Natalie,  and Rob in the four, that Rob would vote one of us girls out in a heartbeat. So I think the best play for me in this game is to just get a  big move going here and get rid of a strong competitor. <br/>We were just thinking that it might be smarter to send Grant  to redemption, and then only one person comes back, whereas if he's still  here, and Mike comes back, then we've got to worry about getting rid of Mike  and him. You know what I mean? <br/>Do you really want to deal with Phillip? <br/>No. I don't want to keep Phillip around. I just want to do what's the smartest to keep us three together. <br/>It's definitely something to consider. Let's just sleep on it and see what happens tomorrow. Ashley actually came to me with this genius plan. Let's get rid of Grant next. I've already run the numbers on this scenario weeks ago. It doesn't make sense. All it does is give Ashley another way closer to squeezing  herself into the finals. She's no good, bro. She wants you gone. She wants to throw you under the bus. She's like, yeah, even if Phillip wins immunity, who cares. <br/>That's a snake, bro. <br/>Dude, she is. Grant, I ain't doing it to you. <br/>I know you're not. <br/>I told you you have my word. But we got to win. Me or you has to win. <br/>Dude, it's done. <br/>We have to win every single one from here on out. All right. That's all. <br/>Ow. Mother...  Ashley is a dark individual, and she's ridden on a  coattail far enough. If Ashley doesn't win immunity, she's out of this game, and I'm  going to be happy to do it, happy. [ laughing ]  Are you ready? <br/>I'm ready, brother. <br/>Okay, good. <br/>We're all on board here. <br/>The more than likely scenario that's going to be happening  is still for us is sticking together until the end, which if you told me that  day 19 I would have called you a liar. <br/>Chopsticks. <br/>Oh, I hope it's chinese food! <br/>Don't even go there. Ashley actually came to me last night and said that she thinks  she wants to get rid of Grant before Phillip. Ashley's had a free ride for 35 days, and her fairy tale's about  to come to an end real abruptly. <br/>Rise and shine. Tree mail. <br/>Tree mail! <br/>You don't have to, like, stand up. But you can definitely sit up. Here we go. <br/>"So close yet so far to go. Leaving now would make you sick. Redemption island gets you one last chance but for now you have  a bone to pick."  What does that mean? What is this? <br/>I don't know. <br/>I have no idea. <br/>Well, we'll find out soon enough. <br/>I feel like it's pretty pivotal for me now. <br/>No. Stop. <br/>I'm just saying, Natalie. <br/>Last night, Natalie and I approached Rob with an idea that  we're going to blindside Grant. And I thought Rob would be like, all about it, and at first he  was kind of hesitant, and then the more he thought about it he was like, that  is a really good idea. So, we'll see, you know. I kind of feel paranoid, like if Grant wins immunity, then I  might be, like, on the chopping block. Rob, thanks for the socks last night. It seriously saved my life. But I really trust Natalie, and I think she's 100% on my side. So if anything's said, Natalie usually lets me know. <br/>This is going to be hard. <br/>Huh? <br/>It's going to be hard because she's--  If she just sticks by you all day I'll just tell you right  before we go, all right. But whatever you need to know, just know that I got your back, Natalie,  all the way to the end. All right? I promise you. I won't do anything that's going to put you in jeopardy. I understand it's going to be hard. But at this point, I can't stand what she's doing to you. I can see it. She's trying to tell you what's in your best interest. She's coming. I want to try that peanut butter-- that snickers brownie thing,  though. I'm, like, seriously going to make that when I go home. <br/>I know. <br/>But I don't know where-- where do you get caramel sauce? Can you buy it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Like, where they have the reese's shell stuff. <br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah. <br/>Is that where it is? Natalie may not be the brightest player to ever play this game,  we all know that. But Natalie is a sweetheart. She's innocent and she's pure, and Ashley's trying to corrupt  that. Ashley and Natalie, they've been close since the beginning of  this game. But it's never been a strategic closeness. And more and more, I see Ashley imposing her wisdom on Natalie. And it's not a good thing. You know what I'm exciting about? It's day 35. And after 35 days of having this pain in my ass, I think I'm  going to finally get some relief tonight. Are you ready to go? <br/>I'm going to win. <br/>All right. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yup. <br/>Jeff: First things first, Rob. Once again, I will take it back. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will use large fish hooks to retrieve  bags of puzzle pieces. You will then use those pieces to complete a puzzle in the shape  of a fish skeleton. To make it a little more interesting, you will do this challenge  with one arm tied behind your back. First person to get it right wins immunity. All five of you are very close to the money. With this around your neck, it ensures you get one step closer. In addition, today, you are playing for reward. It is "Suvivor's" version of room service. You will have a three-course meal delivered to you at camp. Worth playing for? - Yeah. - Yes. <br/>Jeff: All right, we'll draw for sports and get started. Here we go. For immunity and reward, survivors ready? Go! Already difficult having that one arm behind your back makes it  even more difficult. Grant makes quick work of that, has his first bag already. Amazing! Rob has his bag. Ashley now back. Phillip back. Natalie trying to hook that bag of puzzle pieces. She's got it. Natalie heads back. Once you have the pieces free, start placing them on the spine  of the fish skeleton. Grant doing a great job. Phillip now working on his puzzle. Natalie still trying to get the pieces out of the bag using her  teeth. The only rule is these fish bones cannot touch each other. Ashley very close. She knocks a piece out. Grant has his first section finished. He's back out. Grant now has to hook four large hooks. Phillip has his first section done. Rob has his first section done. Phillip is the first one to finish. And it all collapses before he can get back. Phillip has to start over. Natalie still working on her first section. Ashley's been on that first section for a long time. Finally finishes. Phillip has his back together. Rob there. Rob has his together. Ashley quickly gets her four hooks and Ashley is now back in  this. Rob has all the pieces out from his second section. Now Grant has it. Grant is now back. Natalie still inexplicably working on her first section,  knocking pieces out. Rob, quick work on the second section. Ashley has her second section complete. Ashley now in the lead. Grant has his second section complete. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: Phillip has his second section complete. Rob now falling behind. Natalie is still on the first section. Once again, Ashley, the first person to get all five hooks  together like she grew up doing it. Ashley now back. Natalie out of this challenge. You might as well sit down and watch. Grant going for that fifth and final hook. Ashley's working on that final section. Rob has his five hooks. He's heading back. Grant cannot get that last hook. Ashley getting closer. Rob trying to catch her. Phillip trying to get in on it. It is Ashley and Rob right now. Ashley is close. But two pieces are touching. Ashley wins immunity and reward. <br/>Thank god. <br/>Jeff: All right, Ashley, get over here. Right here. Congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Ashley is safe at tonight's tribal council. You cannot be voted out of this game tonight. <br/>Such huge relief. <br/>Jeff: In addition to immunity, reward. Here's how it works. We have a room service menu, and as you can see on this menu,  there are spots for two names. Pick one person, Ashley, to join you. Huge decision for you. <br/>Natalie. <br/>Oh! <br/>She didn't get the last reward, chocolate cake, and I've  drawn a lot of strength from her being out here. <br/>Jeff: Natalie, come on over. <br/>Thank you, ash! <br/>Jeff: All right, "Survivor" room service will be  delivered to your camp for Ashley and Natalie. In addition you gotta figure out who is going home. It will be either Natalie, Grant, Phillip, or Rob who will be  voted out at tonight's tribal council and sent to Redemption Island. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Be kind to your waiter. <br/>You are awesome. Ashley! <br/>Days like today, man, I wish I stayed home. It just happens, you know, when there's one thing you tonight  want to happen, it happens. <br/>Ashley! We can celebrate now! <br/>Food! <br/>And then all of a sudden, Ashley's a friggin' genius. This was all her plan all along. Grant, when you watch this, you're going to realize I never  wanted to do it this way, bud. And, although I'd like to, you know, think of you as a friend, I  didn't come to this game to make friends. I came to this game to win. So even though it does break my heart, bud, I gotta vote your  ass off tonight. The three of us take out Grant. That's it. It's done. <br/>It's done. We don't need to talk about it. It's perfect. It's the perfect time to do it, too. <br/>Yeah, he knows. I think he knows it's him. <br/>Yeah. <br/>But his only options are to either take out Phillip or if  he thinks he can get me and Phillip to take out Natalie. I'm not taking you out. <br/>Okay. <br/>I'm never going to vote against you. So I'll go play bad guy. It seems like no Matter what the situation on  "Survivor," I have to do the dirty work because everybody else is  too stupid to do it. Here's the thing, we've got to go put on an act for Grant. I have to play to Grant is it going to be Natalie or is it going  to be shep? <br/>Right. <br/>Because I have to play to Grant, we can go to Natalie and  we can go to Ashley and try to get you out. <br/>Right. <br/>I'm not getting you out. You have my word. <br/>Okay. I basically told Phillip we're voting for Grant. But then I had to go to Phillip, Ashley and Natalie: "We're  voting for Grant." then I had to go to Grant, ask Grant which way he  wanted to go, if he wanted to go with Phillip or he wanted to go with Natalie. It's a lot of work. It's exhausting. It really is. Dude, what do you think, brother? <br/>Look, I know you and Natalie have a special relationship  but my word is with you, dude, and all we need is me, you and Phillip to vote  for Natalie. For Natalie, or me, you and Natalie to vote for Phillip. What do you feel most comfortable playing? In my head, it's a no-brainer. <br/>Natalie? <br/>Yeah. And I know-- listen, shep--  I almost feel like I can convince Natalie more than I can  convince shep. I don't know. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>I don't know. <br/>If Ashley's in, Natalie's there. <br/>Right. I don't know if she's going to listen to me. She's going to listen to Ashley first. <br/>Right, which I think has already happened, bro. To be honest with you, it's like a couple, no different. Splitting them up is going to be the best route. I promise you this, man, in my gut feeling, I honestly think  shep's with us. And on we roll. <br/>All right. <br/>But you're good with that, though? <br/>That's good, man. <br/>You're good? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Cool. <br/>Blindside. Blindside. <br/>Worst-case scenario happened in the challenge today but  it's okay. We have an escape hatch. Natalie is going to be the one going home tonight. When you look somebody in the eye and shake their hand, you kind  of get a vibe from that person and I got a good one from Rob and sticking to  our alliance. The first course is here. It's going to be exciting. You're going to see my name written down twice, and then here  comes Natalie. [sings a fanfare] the princess is going to have a red carpet  straight to Redemption Island. <br/>Really? <br/>Oh! Thank you! <br/>Natalie and I were making rice for the boys, and all of a  sudden, like, these little waiters show up and they've got, like, their  little bow ties and suits on and they have our platters of food. And we were just like, "See, ya, boys." we ran off. But honestly, if there was any challenge I needed to win, it was  today. So that's why I just feel on top of the world right now. I can't wipe the smile off my face. <br/>Grab a spoon. Grab the spoon. <br/>This is what we have been talking about. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Mmm! I'm speechless. [ laughing ]  Ashley! <br/>Natalie! <br/>This is not even right. <br/>Whew! <br/>Do you feel okay? <br/>Uhhh. <br/>Ooohhh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Thank you so much for picking me. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>I love you. <br/>I love you, too. <br/>Eat a lot. Make yourselves sick. In a good way. <br/>I feel terrible! <br/>I hope you friggin' choke on it. Ashley and Natalie are getting too close for comfort. It's just like amber and I. It's just like Andrea and Matt were at the beginning of this  season. A couple is very powerful in this game. Even if it's two girls, if they trust and believe in each other,  it's a very powerful thing. <br/>Person from redemption comes back and wins, we might have  to team up with them. And kind of use it as... Strategy. Let's just hope the person from redemption comes back tomorrow,  because if not, Rob's going to want to break us up. <br/>Part of me was hoping that Ashley wouldn't pick me just  because it really put me in a sucky position. I feel like I'm stuck. I have Ashley on my side, and I have Rob on my side. And it's really tough because both sides have pros and cons. <br/>What's going on with ash? <br/>She just feels really confident now. <br/>Huh? <br/>She just feels really confident. She's, like, totally counting on me. <br/>Right. <br/>She thinks it's me and her. <br/>But at the end of the day, it's me and you. <br/>Yes. <br/>Yeah. [ hiccups ] ooh. <br/>You knew for a while, but I know Ashley can't be trusted,  either. If she turned on Grant this quickly, it will be me next. I guarantee it. <br/>I'm not going to lie. This sucks. <br/>I know. With Ashley and Natalie getting as close as they're getting, it  could be a real pRoblem if somebody were to come back from Redemption Island,  and they were to decide to join up with that person and decide they don't  need me anymore. In that situation, it would be more advantageous for me to break  up Ashley and Natalie while I have the chance so that that doesn't happen. And I think Grant's a good guy. I really have, like, made a good friendship with him throughout  this show. I'm still sitting in a pretty good spot, even though I didn't  win immunity today. If I decide it's going to be Grant, it's Grant. If I decide it's going to be Natalie, it will be Natalie. <br/>Oh, it's not that bad! <br/>One man should not have this much power in this game. Luckily I'm not an ordinary man. <br/>Jeff: we'll now bring in the members of the jury. David, Julie, Steve, and Ralph. Ashley, 35 days in. Gotta feel pretty good to be wearing that necklace tonight. <br/>Honestly, I had a weird feeling, like, if there was one I  needed to win, it was this one. And I feel really good to be wearing this necklace, honestly. It's the one tribal council that I actually feel safe, and I  feel good. <br/>Jeff: Grant, how badly do you think you needed to win  today. <br/>I think it was pretty crucial that I won today. I am a threat in challenges. And without the necklace, you're a target. <br/>Jeff: Rob, you're vulnerable tonight. <br/>Yeah. I mean, I definitely feel vulnerable. I think maybe the only thing I have going for me is that maybe Grant's  a bigger threat than me. I hope. [ laughs ]  Jeff: Ashley, you win today, and you pick Natalie. The only other girl to join you on the reward. Did you feel a reaction back at camp when it was just you and Natalie  eating? <br/>Natalie's been there for me this whole time. And at this point, in the game, I don't think it's a shock that Natalie  and I are very close--  It may not be a shock, but even hearing you say that you  two are very close, I'm telling you right now, bombs are exploding in Grant, Rob,  and Phillip's ears. Phillip, do you believe that it means nothing that Ashley picked  Natalie? <br/>I mean, none of us thought that we were going to be the  one picked. I mean, we knew that she was going to pick Natalie, so, is it  strategic? Yeah, sure. <br/>Jeff: So, Natalie, then it's pRobably a natural assumption  that you and Ashley would vote together as well. <br/>Yeah. I mean, Ashley and I are very close. So I know that these guys are pRobably looking at maybe me as a  target because they might want to split us up, you know. They may feel that we're dangerous in the game. <br/>Jeff: Grant, clearly, with five people in the game, two  people have votes. Huge. <br/>It's absolutely huge. But you come here with a solid group of people, or maybe even  just two, maybe three. And you've got to put faith that their word is going to be their  bond. <br/>Jeff: Rob, how much of tonight's vote goes into the  category of the person we vote off is going to redemption? <br/>At this point, you can't speculate any more. Nobody knows about redemption. Nobody knows when it's going to end. I thought it was over already. It's still going. <br/>Jeff: Rob, a few more days left in this game. What gets you through this? <br/>My wife and my daughter. That's it. I love my wife more than anything else in the world. And she knows how much I love this game. She's made tremendous sacrifices to let me come out here over  and over and over again to try to win. And we're so close, but, with all the different scenarios, we're  still so friggin' far away. You can try to do everything right the whole game, and then one  little thing here or there, and poof... It's all gone. <br/>Jeff: Grant, how about you? What gets you through these last days? <br/>I think about my soon-to-be wife, who's waiting at home  for me. It brings me to tears every time, just having that bond and that  trust with somebody is... It's a greater gift than anything you can find out  here. And I just know I have got that-- that beautiful spirit just  waiting for me back at home. <br/>Jeff: Rob, how big a vote tonight? <br/>It's the biggest vote we've had so far. At this point, everybody's on edge. I'm on edge. <br/>Jeff: let's get to the vote. Cannot vote for Ashley. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Grant, you're up. <br/>Grant, I think you're too strong of a competitor and too  much of a threat. Sorry. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now would be the time to do so. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Natalie. Grant. One vote Natalie, one vote Grant. Grant. Two votes Grant, one vote Natalie. 15th person voted out: Grant. That's three. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>One of you...  Jeff: Grant, the tribe has spoken. Grab your torch. Head to Redemption Island. You'll have a chance to get back in this game. <br/>See you guys shortly. <br/>Jeff: well, there are only four days left in this game. But there are still a lot of things standing between you and the  million dollars. Perhaps the biggest is the fact that somebody you voted out is  going to return from Redemption Island and re-enter this game. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Next time on the special two-hour season finale, everyone  has a plan to win it all. <br/>It's the three of us till the end. <br/>Jeff: But someone will return from Redemption Island. <br/>Three will fall, one will remain. <br/>Jeff: And it puts everybody in jeopardy. <br/>Pretty big stakes. <br/>All good things must come to an end. <br/>Jeff: Don't miss the end of "Survivor: Redemption  Island."  I didn't think I was going to be voted out. I trusted the people in my alliance. And, you know, it turns out somebody wasn't being honest. And that's just how it goes, but... Possibly Rob betrayed me. Possibly Phillip did. But I'm at peace with everything that I've accomplished out  here, and I don't need anything more. <br/>Hi, guys. <br/>Oh! <br/>Grant!
