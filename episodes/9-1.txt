<br/> <br/>Jeff Probst: I'm standing on the rim of Mt. Yasur, a  massive crater that displays its anger on a regular basis, spewing molten  lava and rock thousands of feet into the air. Locals believe this is the  final resting spot for the spirits of the dead. Yasur is one of nine active  volcanoes on the island nation of Vanuatu in the South Pacific. It is a land  with a fascinating history of cannibalism, where rituals like sorcery and  black magic are still a part of daily life. It is here that 18 Americans are  about to begin the adventure of a lifetime. 18 strangers, all from different  walks of life, forced to work together to create a new society while battling  the elements and each other. They must learn to adapt, or they'll be voted  out of the tribe. In the end, only one will remain to claim the  million-dollar prize. 39 days, 18 people, one Survivor.

[ whistling ]  <br/>Probst: Yeah. [ applause and cheering ] Welcome to  Survivor: Vanuatu-- Islands of Fire. The game is about to begin, but before  it does, you have to be granted access to the land. So you're going to take  part in a tribal ritual. It is a rite of passage and an invitation to stay on  the land, but in order to stay, you must participate. It's going to impact  each of you differently. At times, you may find it beautiful. At times, you  may be repulsed. And at times, you may be frightened. Chief Mormor will  preside over all of this. He is a real chief. I will be there, but he will  guide you through it. The tribes of Vanuatu take their spirituality very  seriously. The ceremony you're going to take part in is an authentic Vanuatu  tribal tradition. You are in a foreign country. Remember that. This is their  culture. We are only visitors. It's time to go over. Three in a canoe. Down  the rope ladder.  <br/>Jeff gave us an overview, saying how the customs of  Vanuatu are not like we're used to, so I was... I was really nervous after he  was talking to us. I'm like, "What are they going to do?"  <br/>Jeff informed us we're going to climb down the side of the  boat and we're going to get in these canoes. I thought, 'Man, that's great,'  because I didn't learn how to swim until six weeks before I come here. I  would've been spooked if I knew I had to swim. [ screaming ]  <br/>We get into the boat, and it tips over, so I'm trying to  hold onto the rope to keep me up. It was killing my back, but I wasn't about  to move again. I was going to stay right where I was at. We finally got  another boat over there. [ singing ] [ chanting ]  <br/>When the natives took us into the middle of the ring where  everybody circled around us, it was really overwhelming for me, and I don't  know if it was just the anticipation of getting started or the whole thing,  but I was... really, I was moved to tears. [ native people screaming ]  <br/>There was a bunch of [ native people screaming ]  <br/>There was a bunch of tribesmen running with spears. My  first reaction was, you know, "What's going on?" We were like,  "Wha-Wha-What? Are we suppose to defend ourselves? What are we supposed  to do?"  <br/>They're jabbing spears at absolutely everybody except me.  Nobody jabbed a spear at me in any way, shape or form, which I took as, you  know, a black man coming on the island is not particularly unwelcome. [  singing ]  <br/>These guys in their big cone-shaped jungle dresses-- they  have these big sticks, and they start, you know, pulling people out with the  sticks, but kind of, like, you know, whacking 'em out. Soon enough, I noticed  that they were bringing the women to one side. We look over, and the guys,  you know... Like, we're, like, kneeling on a mat, and they all have, like,  little, like, stump seats to sit on. And they're, like, right in the center  of the action. We're kind of off to the side. And so I immediately start  thinking, 'What's with this? I thought we were all supposed to be part of  this ceremony.'  <br/>They brought a bowl out, and they uncovered the palm  leaves off of it, and they were pointing at it. Well, I thought maybe I was  supposed to wash my fingers or something, you know? Uh, we were getting ready  to eat something or-or, uh, wash my fingers, 'cause it was some  rustic-looking stuff.  <br/>Chief Mormor offers each one of us this kava, which is the  local drink. It's like mud, basically. You drink it. Your lips go numb, and  your tongue goes numb, and your throat goes numb. [ spitting ] [ laughing  ]  <br/>The chief is welcoming us, and I look over at the girls,  and they're not getting anything to drink. And I'm thinking, 'Wow, this is  pretty cool.' You know, special treatment for the guys. [ spitting ]  <br/>I was waiting for our turn. I was like, "Well, okay,  well, when do we get kava?" But it never came around. We're not getting  the full deal here. I'm not used to being put second behind a man. [ man  chanting ] [ men singing in response ]  <br/>Probst: Keep if mind, guys, what is about to happen next  is a common part of their tribal tradition.  <br/>Apparently, the Vanuatu people really honor pigs. Pigs  are, I think, sometimes better than women. Anyway, so, they come in with this  pig. Right away, I thought, 'Okay, we're having a pig roast,' you know? But I  thought the pig was dead. And then I realized the pig was alive.  <br/>I eat meat, and I know that animals are slaughtered, but,  like, seeing it was just like... [ gasps ] Like, I-I literally think I gasped  out loud, because it was just so shocking to watch.  <br/>That kind of stuff doesn't bother me, because I'm a  shepherdess, and that's what I do. I-I raise lambs for that exact purpose: to  slaughter. So I totally understand that ritual.  <br/>The head chief took the blood of his sacrifice and went to  each male member of Survivor-- no, no females-- and said, "You are now  a-a, you know, a warrior in Vanuatu." And basically, I felt what he was  doing was he was saying "Welcome." [ cheering ]  <br/>Probst: There's one element [ cheering ]  <br/>Probst: There's one element left to this initiation. It  involves a spiritual stone. It is believed on these lands that this carved  stone and other stones like it ward off evil spirits. Last thing you want in  this game is bad luck. Possessing this stone could give you a spiritual  advantage in the game. As you've seen, men and women are treated very  differently. The chief is offering the men a chance to possess this stone.  The only hitch is you have to get it from the top of that pole, which has  been greased with pig fat. If you fail, the women get it. The chief will  decide in which order you go. To show you that it can be done, he's going to  instruct a tribe member to take it up and put it there now.  <br/>Ever who possesses that stone, the spirits are supposed to  be in favor. Even though that's not my beliefs, I still wanted that stone,  just so the girls wouldn't get it. [ cheering and hooting ]  <br/>We were all going, "I don't want to be the one that  falls flat on my face in front of everybody." The chief turned around,  and he pointed in my direction. I was like, "Oh, my God. No, not  me." And I went like this out of the way. I said, "Yeah, him?"  [ cheering ]  <br/>I was just praying to God he was going to pick somebody  else, but he picked me. As soon as he did, I figured the only way I'd even  have any chance is to do it kind of like the other guy did it. And I got a  little dirt on my feet, in my hands. And I just hung on for dear life.  <br/>The girls were praying that the boys were not going to do  it. So I was like, "Please fall." We want to see some of them fall  at least. [ cheering ] [ thunder crashing ] [ cheering ]  <br/>As soon as he got that rock, it started raining like  pouring pee out of a boot on a flat rock. It was definitely spooky, but I  didn't care, we got the rock. [ cheering ]  <br/>Now, it's time to begin Survivor. Because you have been  divided by the chief into groups of men and women, you will stay that way.  Men in possession of the Spiritual Stone, you are the Lopevi Tribe. You will  wear red.  <br/>Men against women. It's perfect. I can outsmart eight men  a hell of a lot quicker than I can outsmart eight women. Women stick  together. They're thick as thieves. Men are deceiving, mischievous,  untrusting human beings. Men-- I can manipulate.  <br/>Probst: You are the Yasur Tribe. Named after the volcano.  You will wear yellow.  <br/>When I found out we was splitting the men and the women, I  looked around at them little girls and I thought, "Oh, Lord, what did  you get me into?" We had a couple of ol' prissy ones. They probably  hadn't even been dirty in their entire days and they ain't got a clue what's  in store for the next God knows how many days.  <br/>Probst: Your next task is to find your tribal beaches. You  will not have a map to guide you. You will not have fire to lead the way. It  is going to be a long, dark, wet walk. And when you get there, you will have  a pot, you will have a machete and you will have a map to water, and that's  it. Have a good 39 days. Men, down the beach this way. Keep walking till you  find your tribe flag. [ thunder crashing ] Ladies, down to the beach, head right.  [ cheering ]  <br/>I think the boys got a lot more out of that ceremony than  we did. I think we definitely got a bum deal. So we're out for blood now. [  cheering ]  <br/>Okay, girls. Be really careful.  <br/>You have to hold on to the next person.  <br/>This is really slippery roots here so be really  careful.  <br/>Oh, whoa, Scout.  <br/>One down, one up.  <br/>Are you okay?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>What do you think, Scout? I'm going with your years of  experience and... and, uh, know- how here, because I don't want to... I don't  want to walk around all night.  <br/>I just wanted to hunker down till daylight came so we  could, you know, find our camp easier and everybody would be safe. I wasn't  tired. I just love to sit and visit. I haven't said anything to anybody here,  but I'm schlepping around an artificial knee. So I'm pretty cautious crawling  across lava rock that deep at night with it raining. [ hooting ]  <br/>Yeah?  <br/>Ami and Dolly and Scout didn't want to come along. They  almost insisted on just stopping where we were and, you know, sleeping. Like,  I think sleeping right here is, like, the stupidest thing we could possibly  do.  <br/>You guys, come on up here!  <br/>Come on.  <br/>We want to hang out. We want to get to know each  other.  <br/>We want you to come hang out with us.  <br/>Hey, girls, let's make a group decision. What way do you  want to go?  <br/>I don't want to hold you. I want you guys to go at your  pace, you know. I just, I feel like they're headed the wrong direction, so I  want you to go on. I'm happy to stay back.  <br/>Somebody needs to make a decision.  <br/>It got to a point where we couldn't make a decision  whether we should continue or go back or if we missed the flag, or... We were  really kind of afraid that we missed camp altogether 'cause it's dark  out.  <br/>I really had my heart set on find our camp tonight.  <br/>Me, too.  <br/>I didn't want to be too pushy because I didn't want to be,  like, the odd person out.  <br/>Are you going to be able to sleep in this rain and  cold?  <br/>No, no, I want to keep walking.  <br/>We might as well keep walking.  <br/>Luckily, you know, other people agreed with me that, um,  we should continue. Scout, will you come with us if we chose to go, or are  you going to...?  <br/>Yeah, I'll go with you.  <br/>Come on, girl.  <br/>Yeah, let's go forward.  <br/>We don't want the guys to find their camp before us. [  scattered laughing ]  <br/>I know, I know.  <br/>Whoo!  <br/>It's the blind leading the blind here.  <br/>Where's the flag, bro?  <br/>I don't think nine of us would miss it.  <br/>Can we hold on a quick second? We really need to come up  with some sort of game plan because this walking our path is bull... I mean,  we got nine of us. There's got to be a better way than this. Now we can keep  walking along the path, and some of us can walk along the path, but then we  passed several trails that are going up, and we have no idea where those  things are going. Nine of us walking in a group like a bunch of ladies ain't  helping.  <br/>Rory, I don't think he's going to fit in. There is one in  every bunch, you know what I mean? To see, like, Rory already barking out  orders, what is he thinking? I'll be honest with you, the walk is, like, kind  of keeping us busy, like, we got something to do, just walk. Like, you know  what I mean? Once we find camp anyway, what are we going to do when we get  there anyway?  <br/>What does the group want to do? What do we want to  do?  <br/>Keep walking?  <br/>Move on.  <br/>Move out, move out.  <br/>I don't think there was any independent thought. I think  that we could've covered more ground if we weren't all walking in a big pack  of nine guys all at once. Some of the younger guys that... that are here,  none of them want to listen. They're all young.  <br/>Little tension on the first night. [ scattered chuckling  ]  <br/>What's that right there? Does that look like a stick with  a flag on it? Yo, it's the flag! [ whooping ] We got the flag!  <br/>Yeah! [ talking excitedly ]  <br/>Let's be real careful.  <br/>This has got to be it.  <br/>Please be our beach, please be our beach, please be our  beach.  <br/>Yeah! [ whooping and cheering ] You guys, we did it! [  cheering ] We see the flag and, you know, all the trouble, all the conflicts,  like, dissolved. We're all hugging and thrilled to death that we're  here.  <br/>Here's to be persevering and being strong! [ cheering  loudly ] [ whooping ]  <br/>Okay, now what? [ scattered laughing ]  <br/>Should we bring the rest of the fronds over?  <br/>I think now let's pull in what we got and see and then tie  'em down. You got to tie all these up to that center piece. Boy, we've got a  really sturdy rack for a shelter. It's been a group effort. I've stayed with  it, and Twila has stayed with it, and, uh, Leann stayed with it. But some of  the gals are down there on the beach basking in the sun, chitchatting.  <br/>Oh, praise the spirit for the sun.  <br/>Rub it on.  <br/>It's scrub, deodorant. Shampoo.  <br/>I call all these sorority girls "bowheads." That's  what we call them back in Oklahoma. They all like to hang together. They're  like cattle. I mean, really, cows, they just cluster. And those sorority  chicks, they aren't paying attention to any damn thing but themselves. You  know, they're their favorite topic.  <br/>I'm really not a negative person. Like, I'm awfully  optimistic in most cases, but for some reason, I just don't think we're going  to get fire from rubbing two, like, quasi dry sticks together.  <br/>Eliza, she talks nonstop. She's probably at the top of my  list, just to get her mouth out of my face. I'm telling you.  <br/>Dude, are they building shelter right now? I don't see  them.  <br/>Just lean up against this and hold that. Slide down a  little bit, though. [ chuckles ]  <br/>Twila has been working on the shelter constantly. I feel  like her continuous work has made those of us who have taken reasonable  breaks look bad in her mind to think that, oh, they're not pulling their  weight. Hey, ladies, looking great.  <br/>We had too much chattering and not enough moving. Mouths  are working but the hands ain't. The hut still is not done. There is a couple  of them that didn't do nothing but bitch, moan and complain last night. We  was all cold. You know, get off your ass, get the... done or don't bitch  about it tonight when you're freezing your butt off.  <br/>We know where our water source is. It's just a little  creek with some fresh water. It looks really clean, but it's still going to  have to be boiled, and... I guess our problem right now is we just got to get  a fire going.  <br/>Hey, you guys, before we start the fire, let's get the,  uh, let's get the Immunity Rock, huh? Rub the rock's head.  <br/>Fire.  <br/>Well, you know, it worked at home when I did this. You  make a little notch in this fire tray and put the ball of tinder right in  here. On the opposite side, you make a groove. The Aborigines did this, why  can't we?  <br/>J.P. wants to prove himself bad. He's about 30 years old,  and he's feeling like, you know, I'm buff, I'm bad, I'm young, I'm all, you  know, go to the end of this. He don't have a clue. He's got the frame, but he  ain't got the brain.  <br/>Slackening.  <br/>Yup, there you go, dude. Keep it going.  <br/>Yup.  <br/>This is going to be it. Keep going.  <br/>Ton of smoke, ton of smoke.  <br/>We need more smoke, more smoke, dude. [ grunting ]  <br/>Dump it... Blow it...  <br/>It's here... It's right here, it's right here, it's right  here.  <br/>We actually had a hot ember, which was very pink.  <br/>Oh, you're getting it.  <br/>Yeah, that's it.  <br/>Just go, go, go.  <br/>Easy, easy...  <br/>I think we were all excited to see a hot ember, but none  of us knew what to do with it. We were just kind of like, "Yeah, we've  got ember." No.  <br/>No!  <br/>We were so close to getting fire going that I thought we  were gonna be able to boil water. Didn't work.  <br/>You got those leaves?  <br/>You guys check it out. I got to... I got to show you  this.  <br/>There's one more right now.  <br/>You guys agree that I had a pretty good run down here, I  didn't fall or anything?  <br/>After doing things that are physically demanding, I felt  like it was the right time to-to reveal the fact that I have no foot, that  it's a prosthesis. They were pretty surprised. It's a rare form of cancer  called synovial sarcoma. And I just had a little, uh, bump in the bottom of  my foot...  <br/>Dude.  <br/>...and thought it was nothing. I thought it was a cyst. I  lost it about 20 months ago.  <br/>Dude, it's inspirational that you're here. It's  awesome.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I know.  <br/>Good on you, mate.  <br/>I had absolutely no idea that Chad had no leg. I mean, he  had... He was wearing pants the whole day, so he just goes, "Hey, guys,  look." And then he unzippered his pants, and there was no leg. It was  pretty... It was pretty shocking.  <br/>It's, uh...  <br/>Extremely mobile, man. You did a hell of a job with  it.  <br/>Well, I try.  <br/>Great. The guy with the mechanical leg's gonna win for  sure. He's nice, he's smart, he's quiet, and he... you know, he's got the  underdog thing going on, so we're screwed.  <br/>That's awesome, dude. I had no idea.  <br/>I'm amazed. All the power to him. I totally think that's  inspirational, but if I have to vote his ass out of here tomorrow, I'm still  gonna vote his ass out of here tomorrow.  <br/>Let's go.  <br/>Tree mail.  <br/>Whoo!  <br/>Tree mail.  <br/>How cool.  <br/>I know.  <br/>Is this it?  <br/>"A show of pride and unity, each time the two tribes meet.  Bring your tribal flag with you whenever you complete."  <br/>Compete.  <br/>Compete. "Access..."  <br/>"Assess your tribe mates strengths. Whose talents you'll  require."  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>"One tribe leaves with heads hung low, the others go home  with fire." [ gasping and cheering ]  <br/>They don't have it. They don't have it.  <br/>We got tree mail, and, um, we're all psyched up, 'cause  supposedly we're gonna get some fire.  <br/>Obviously, most people think that girls are weaker, and  women aren't cut out for this kind of thing, so I think it's really important  that we win this challenge. We're gonna go and kick some butt.  <br/>Probst: Yasur, the ladies, butt.  <br/>Probst: Yasur, the ladies, how is it going so far? Two  nights.  <br/>Two long, cold...  <br/>No fire.  <br/>...wet nights.  <br/>No fire.  <br/>But it's going awesome.  <br/>Probst: All right, Lopevi, you guys, grinning. No problem,  right? First three days, how is it going so far?  <br/>We still need fire before we're gonna drink water. So we  need to boil ours. We're not taking any chances.  <br/>Probst: Okay. Let's get to the first challenge. It is for  both reward and immunity. There are several elements. All nine of you must go  under the mud crawl. Once all nine of you have made it to the other size of  the mud crawl, three tribe members will tackle the box maze. Your goal is to  maneuver a ball from the start to the finish net. Once the ball gets in the  net, take it with you, because it has matches inside that you're gonna need  later. The next stage, all nine must cross a very narrow balance beam. If you  fall off, or if your feet hit the net at any time, you got to go back to the  start. Once all nine have finished, three different tribe members will race  to build a fire that will burn a rope and drop a torch. Light it, cross the  finish line. First tribe with a lit torch to cross the finish line and light  the final wok wins reward and immunity. Want to know what the reward  is?  <br/>Absolutely.  <br/>Absolutely.  <br/>It's flint. [ applause ]  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>You already have steel with the machete. This will give you  fire, give you warmth, let you boil water. But more important than reward is  this. Immunity.  <br/>All right.  <br/>Probst: This is what you want in this game. If you have  immunity, you are safe. You cannot be voted out. Without it, you are  vulnerable. Ready to go?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Take your spots on the start and wait for my go.  All right. Here we go for reward and immunity. Survivors ready? Go! Through  the mud pit. Everybody dead even.  <br/>Come on.  <br/>Come on...  <br/>Come on... Come on.  <br/>Probst: Pretty even. Keep moving. Get your face down and  dig through. John and Lisa are across.  <br/>Come on, go. Come on...  <br/>Probst: A lot of teamwork going on. The women pulling each  other through. Guys pulling each other through. [ people shouting ] Dead  even. Let's go. Get her through. Get her through. Pull him! Got to get on the  mat. Men are through the mud. Men moving on to the box maze. Get on the mat.  Drag her. Women through the mud. Women moving on to the box maze.  <br/>Careful. Does it need to go over there?  <br/>It goes here, it goes here...  <br/>Probst: You need the maneuver the ball into the finish  net.  <br/>Don't let it go in yet.  <br/>Ready? Now. Now.  <br/>We're in.  <br/>No. Just take your time. Easy. Right there.  <br/>Probst: Guys hit a roadblock.  <br/>That needs to go through this one.  <br/>No, down.  <br/>Down...  <br/>Here.  <br/>Nice. [ indistinct chatter ]  <br/>It won't fit.  <br/>Probst: Girls working together well.  <br/>Oh, oh.  <br/>Oh, come on.  <br/>Probst: The men have it. Moving on with their ball to the  balance beam.  <br/>Nice. Now, tilt, tilt. Don't let it go down now.  <br/>Probst: Chad first up on the balance beam. Keep working.  You're still in this.  <br/>Now, we can't let it go through that last one.  <br/>Okay, okay, bring it back. I'll bring it back.  <br/>Don't tilt it. Just go nice and tiny.  <br/>Probst: Bubba is down. Back to the start.  <br/>Go, go, go, go...  <br/>Probst: John makes it across. The women have it. Ladies,  you're still in it.  <br/>Go, go, go.  <br/>Come on.  <br/>Go, go, go, go, go...  <br/>Probst: Brady, you're across and down.  <br/>Go.  <br/>Come on, women. Agility, agility.  <br/>Probst: Bubba gonna crawl. Oh, scraping his belly against  that wood. That cannot feel good.  <br/>You got it, man. Come on.  <br/>Think fire, think fire.  <br/>Come on, think about it.  <br/>Probst: Bubba working it.  <br/>Let's go, let's go. She's catching you, she's passing  you.  <br/>Probst: You cannot touch any part of the net.  <br/>She's passing you.  <br/>Probst: Leann makes it. Women have their first woman  across. Get those feet up there.  <br/>Good man.  <br/>Probst: Bubba's through.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Let's go, come on...  <br/>Go.  <br/>Probst: Chad you're there. Keep moving Twila. Watch your  feet. Keep 'em up. That a way. Drag those feet up. You're good.  <br/>Hurry, hurry!  <br/>Probst: Lea makes it. You're down. Dolly, you're good. That  a way to dig, Rory. [ people shouting ] Mia makes it across. Women are  closing the gap. That a the way, Rory. Down to you two. Down to Scout and  Chris. [ all shouting ]  <br/>Probst: No, Chris to the back. Hustle, man, you got it.  Stay in this! [ all shouting ]  <br/>Probst: Women have taken the lead. Hustle, Scout. You got  to get to the mat. [ all shouting ]  <br/>Keep going, keep going.  <br/>Probst: Let's go, men. You're still in it. Women have to  make fire.  <br/>Start it small. Start it small then roll around it.  <br/>Then we'll grab it.  <br/>Move forward. Move forward, buddy.  <br/>Don't do it...  <br/>Just like you're walking on the sidewalk, bro.  <br/>It's all you, man.  <br/>He's off again. He's off again.  <br/>It's all you, man.  <br/>Plenty of time, dude. Take your time. Focus.  <br/>Get a few tall sticks on there.  <br/>Come on, man, it's all you.  <br/>Keep your feet straight.  <br/>Jimmy.  <br/>Come on, girls. [ indistinct chatter ]  <br/>Probst: Ladies have fire.  <br/>Whoo!  <br/>Probst: Protect that fire. Block the wind.  <br/>You can do this, Chris! You can do it, man. Say to  yourself, you can do it, buddy.  <br/>Just think how warm we'll be tonight, please.  <br/>Okay, let's go now.  <br/>They got as far as... now.  <br/>Whoo!  <br/>Look up. Let's go.  <br/>It's all you. It's all you, man. You're the man. You got  our support.  <br/>Here we go, here we go. Here we go. Keep it going. Keep it  going.  <br/>Go faster, go faster, go faster, go faster...  <br/>Go, go, go, go...  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Probst: Here it goes. [ all shouting ]  <br/>Fire!  <br/>Oh, fire!  <br/>There it is. There it goes! [ indistinct chatter ]  <br/>Go! [ cheering ]  <br/>Probst: Yasur across the finish line. The women win the  first challenge-- reward and immunity! [ cheering ]  <br/>WOMEN [ chanting ]: Fire and water and immunity, fire and  water and immunity...! [ cheering ]  <br/>Probst: Yasur, right here. [ cheering ] That's going back  to camp. No Tribal Council for you guys.  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: And flint. Water tonight. You'll stay warm.  Congratulations.  <br/>ALL: Thank you.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>In the mood for a hot meal?  <br/>Probst: Lopevi, tough break. Chris, certainly gave it  everything you had. We'll see if it mattered or not tonight at Tribal  Council. Somebody is going home. First person voted out. I'll see you  there.  <br/>Whoo! [ cheering ]  <br/>Hey, bottom line, I think we underestimated them, man.  They did a good job.  <br/>Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we just lost.  <br/>Losing fire right now was tough. Losing to women was  tough.  <br/>I want to tell you guys a little bit more about myself.  I'm not real good at balance. [ laughter ]  <br/>Chris couldn't get across the balance beam. The fact is,  he didn't make it, and we lost.  <br/>I'd get halfway and hit a wall. I really wanted to make it  across the beam. You know, if I had wings, I'd have made it. You know, I  would have made myself go across the beam. This game, you outwit, outplay,  outlast people. You don't out-balance them.  <br/>It has to be. You don't out-balance them.  <br/>It has to be. You know what I'm saying?  <br/>I totally agree.  <br/>We have to win this game.  <br/>Lea, what do you think... who are you leaning towards  tonight? We're just talking, as a group, we want to be a strong group.  <br/>Bottom line is, I want to beat those girls, and I want to  keep getting immunity. The way I'm going to do it is, it's basically the  weakest link.  <br/>I'm going to give it a few hours and see what the  attitudes are, 'cause, I mean, I like everybody.  <br/>That's the thing.  <br/>I don't have no bad quarrels with nobody. J.P., Brady,  John and Brook-- they basically said, "Sarge, we need to get rid of the  weakest link." It's tricky to decide who I'm going to vote for. I said  I'm going to think about it. They said the weakest link. They're assuming  that I agree that the weakest link is Chris. If we're going to stay in this--  the old people-- the only way we're going get a million dollars, one of us,  is if we get rid of the young people.  <br/>But J.P. is the only one that really is trying to make  fire. I'd say Brook. Brook is cocky, and we don't know where he lies.  <br/>I'll talk to Chad. I prepared to come here mentally, and I  prepared to play the game. I'm not vulnerable at all. We got a plan.  <br/>I'm just trying to survive the first couple days.  <br/>The one thing you got to worry about is you never know.  Those guys could smarten up, which I hope they didn't. Personally, I think  these are all young guys on the team, guys are going to be targets. I feel  like I am one of the stronger, younger guys who's going to be a target.  <br/>Right now, we're in charge of... As of right now, you know  what I mean?  <br/>Not necessarily.  <br/>Trust me.  <br/>Cool.  <br/>You know what I'm saying?  <br/>All right, cool. I'm down.  <br/>All right.  <br/>Well, obviously I haven't fully made up my mind on who I'm  going to vote for yet tonight. I'm thinking about Chris right now, but Rory,  he's kind of on his own sheet of music a lot of the time. I think maybe some  people feel like Rory is maybe not putting out as much group effort as some  of the other guys, and the group right now is where it's all at.  <br/>Probst: Behind each of you right now is where it's all  at.  <br/>Probst: Behind each of you right now is where it's all  at.  <br/>Probst: Behind each of you guys is a torch. Go ahead and  grab a touch, approach a flame and get fire. Because in this game, fire  represents your life. As long as your torch has fire, you're still in the  game. When your flame is gone, so are you. Welcome to your first Tribal  Council-- definitely not the place you want to be. Somebody is going to go  home as a result of today's loss. But before we get to the vote, let's talk  about today's challenge. Anybody here willing to admit that as they saw Chris  fail, fail, fail, that they started thinking, "This guy is killing  us."  <br/>Oh, I mean, yeah. Because it was so easy. And I'm saying,  "Come on, bring your big tail across the doggone beam. We were ahead;  now we're losing. All we got to do is build a little fire, blow the torch and  win over these females."  <br/>Probst: Chris, at any point while you're trying to cross  it, are you also thinking, "I'm dead, I'm going home  tonight"?  <br/>No, I wasn't. I wasn't thinking "I'm going home  tonight." I wasn't thinking "I'm dead." I don't categorize  stuff like that. The first night, Rory, he had some ideas. He was getting on  people's nerves. Did I all of a sudden develop an opinion about him and  think, "You know what? He's going home the first time I go to Tribal  Council." No, I didn't think that. Everybody's going to help the team  some way, sometime down along the line, and that's all I think about.  <br/>Probst: Rory, how are you fitting in with this  group?  <br/>I fit in fabulously well, and I love my partners here.  We've accepted every single thing that's come our way as a family and as a  team, and I would expect that's the way we're going to continue to  operate.  <br/>Probst: J.P., how close are you to crisis mode in terms of  not having water?  <br/>We're on red alert. I mean, when you get into this game,  you realize, you take a lot of things for granted, and water is one of them.  You start getting headaches. You can't get up. You're lethargic. You start  cramping. It's taken a toll on all of us in some way or another.  <br/>Probst: Before we get to the vote, there's one other topic  we have to bring up. You got your first look today at the women.  <br/>Mmm.  <br/>Probst: Bubba, that was just a little grunt or a groan, or  a...?  <br/>Jeff, I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times.  You never underestimate a woman. I knew going into this that these women were  going to be fighting hard, and I hope now everybody respects these ladies,  'cause they mean business, and they can kick our tail, Jeff.  <br/>Probst: Brook, anybody you wouldn't mind ending up on a  tribe with?  <br/>Yeah, there was a couple girls that had really nice, um,  tails, but, uh, I was real impressed with how competitive some of those girls  were. It's one thing to expect it, and one thing to see those girls shimmying  across that beam and grinding their teeth and screaming and yelling just  'cause they want to beat us so bad. But, yeah, I was peeking over quite often  when I got a chance.  <br/>Probst: J.P., you had to be a little surprised nine women  kicked your guys' butt.  <br/>I think as the group, we expected to win. Nine males,  Jeff-- there's nine of us. We're all brute strong. We're going to have to  come in and play the game a little bit harder. They just raised the level of  the game.  <br/>Probst: With that, it is time to vote. Brook, you're up  first.  <br/>Chris, I'm making this vote to save my own butt, and it's  definitely strategy. Good luck, bud.  <br/>If you get voted off tonight, we'll miss your sage  comments around camp. Right now, man, it's all about team and winning.  <br/>I'm just playing the team and winning.  <br/>I'm just playing the game, man. I started playing it when  I got to the beach. It's all part of the game.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read,  the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal  Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. The first vote. Chris. Chris.  That's two votes Chris. Rory. Brook. Brook. That's two votes Brook, two votes  Chris. One vote Rory. Chris. Brook. Three votes Brook, three votes Chris. One  vote Rory. Brook. Four votes Brook, three votes Chris. First person voted out  of Survivor: Vanuatu-- Islands of Fire-- Brook. You need to bring your torch.  Brook, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Three different tribe  members received votes. You guys are going back to camp. No water, no fire,  'cause you're going to earn it or you're going to build it. You guys can head  back to camp. Good night.

Being here is like being in  prison.  <br/>Probst: And Rory gets mad.  <br/>That was nonsense. That was classless.  <br/>I just don't think, you know...  <br/>Show some class!  <br/>The one thing I didn't want was to be the first person  off. Who the hell wants to be the first person off? But, uh, during these  three days in the game, I don't think I have learned much about myself. My  only problem was, the other 17 people here just gave me an absolute schooling  in the game of Survivor, so... Uh, you know, I got beat. The bottom line--  someone got me. They got me good. Peace out, Survivorland.
