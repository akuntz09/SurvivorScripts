<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor: When the two tribes first hit the beach,  they stayed true to their nature. The Heroes were heroic, and the Villains were villainous. Villains were villainous. The Heroes overcame injuries... The Heroes overcame injuries...  Probst: ...to win the first challenge. They also tirelessly worked together to build a great camp. <br/>Watching these guys working together-- it's good to be a Hero. <br/>Villains! <br/>Get your evil on. <br/>Probst: The Villains did not work together and complained work together and  complained about everything. about everything. <br/>Probst: It was the perfect environment for Russell to work his black magic. Russell made deals with anyone who would listen and even roped who would  listen and even roped in Parvati. in Parvati. <br/>Probst: But by day two, the game started to change. At the Heroes' camp, J.T. embraced the dark side by making conflicting deals with making conflicting  deals with James and Tom. James and Tom. <br/>You're my guy for the end. <br/>All right, you got me. <br/>Probst: At the Villains' camp, Boston Rob behaved heroically. He worked hard around camp and even built a fire without flint. And after getting sick and passing out, he got up and led his tribe to a come-from-behind  victory at the immunity challenge. Villains win the second immunity challenge in a row! After their second defeat in a row, the Heroes were demoralized, and James  lashed out. <br/>He was telling you what to do, and everybody mouth want to talk. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, James continued his tirade. <br/>You're trying to blame this entire challenge on me? <br/>Probst: And J.T.'s duplicity was revealed when he chose not to honor his  alliance with Tom by voting out Tom's closest ally, Stephenie. Steph, the tribe has spoken. 18 are left. 18 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? [squeaking] [squeaking]  There's a lot of frustration, James. I get that. You could have been gentler, that's all. Let's do what we can to get it back on track, you know? <br/>I can't believe...  I think we cleared up a lot of things. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We aired things that needed to be said. Um...  Let's work together, man. <br/>That's all I want to do, man. <br/>Right. We got a good fire going. <br/>I love that. It's nice to come home to fire. <br/>At Tribal Council tonight, I mean, just a nasty turn with... All right,  Steph's going, and then, James got to bring down, you know, just nasty,  brutish bullying on her. The vibe now is, everybody comes home, puts on a happy face, and, uh, tries  to make it as pleasant as possible to be together. [indistinct chatter]  I respect you a lot, Tom. Here's the thing, man. I'm sorry for-for everything. I'm sorry for-for everything. I-I knew... I-I knew... I-I knew...  Right. <br/>Right. <br/>Hey, listen, sometimes with numbers, that's the way the dice come up. I'm a big boy. I'm okay with that. <br/>Hey, I'm sorry, man. <br/>Nope, it's all good. It's all good. <br/>I'll do my best. <br/>I feel betrayed by J.T., but if he really does feel bad about it, um, he  might be the guy to keep me alive a little longer and buy me some extra time  if I and buy me some extra time if I need it. need it. <br/>Right. It's hard to play nice after a scene like that, but that's exactly what we  need to do. Right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>To be fair, the game has been ugly, so maybe we were naive to think we were  coming back, and it was going to be Marquis of Queensberry rules here and  everybody fighting fair, and...  Right. <br/>So, we know the guys that are playing the game, and, uh, be smarter. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Be smarter. <br/>Be smarter. <br/>Okay, hold it, hold it. I'm going to try to get in here. I don't know what...  Ugh! Oh, it hurts! <br/>Ow! Ow! This sucks. <br/>Oh. <br/>Is he moving again? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Does your head stay on his chest, or does it roll off? [laughter] Mine just rolls right off. It won't stay. Ew! [laughter] Stop it! Stop it! [laughter continues] [laughter continues] [laughter]  Ew! <br/>I mean, at the end of the day, I wanted to see what would develop, and you  notice different things around camp. I mean, the clearest sign... For anybody that's going to play Survivorin the  future, I'm going to give you the key to figuring out who's on what team. Watch how they sleep at night. Whoever's sleeping next to who-- and I'm even guilty of it-- will tell you  who's aligned with who. Because at night when you go to sleep, you don't usually go to sleep next to  the guy who you want to vote off. <br/>All right. Sorry. <br/>It's okay. <br/>I don't trust Russell's ass at all. At all. I mean, he's running around with puppy doggy eyes over Parvati since the  minute we landed here. He won't do anything without her. He has to sleep next to her every night. Coach and Jerri are trying to do the same thing. That can be dangerous. I know. I've been there. And I know how powerful that And I know how powerful that kind of an alliance  is. kind of an alliance is. <br/>Our tribe has not been solid since we've been together. That's why I was kind of hoping for a rainy day that would force us all in  the shelter, all day today, and play games and talk and do some bonding stuff  and do some empowerment stuff. <br/>This is the coop, huh? Sweet! <br/>If we don't become a good, cohesive team, we will continue to lose. <br/>Get them inside. <br/>Get them inside. [clucking] [clucking]  They got out. <br/>Hell, yeah! Free chickies! <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>That's him right there. <br/>Get him out of there. <br/>Oh, they're right there, y'all. Let's just grab them. <br/>Grab 'em, bro. [loud clucking]  Okay, there's one of them. <br/>Hold him. <br/>I don't even see the other one. <br/>Oh, there he is. <br/>There he is! There he is! There he is! <br/>Grab him! <br/>Hang on. Don't... Don't get him running. Don't get him running. <br/>He is now wanted, dead or alive, so it's his choice. <br/>He just went out that way, that way, that way. What? <br/>There he goes. He's under the shelter. <br/>Surround the shelter and let's do the same thing. <br/>He's coming out the back. <br/>That's good. Yeah. <br/>Good. <br/>Good, good, good, Tom, very, very good... [whooping]  Still got it! <br/>Good job, Tom! <br/>It was a neat experience, wrangling the chickens as a tribe. tribe. Um, that's what we need. Um, that's what we need. <br/>So in that sense, the chickens getting out was supposed to happen to help us  supposed to happen to help us bond. bond. bond. [Rupert snorts] [Rupert snorts]  They're not going to kill that thing so fast. <br/>I can't believe that thing is just sitting there, dude. <br/>So, what's up, man? <br/>The first vote is the most important vote. <br/>Right. <br/>You got to be careful. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. You got to be careful, 'cause people want to have any excuse to not be the  vote. What is that excuse? "Oh, Russell and Parvati are together."  Right. <br/>Whatever it is...  Right. <br/>Everybody's going to use an excuse so it's not them. Russell, um, is walking on very thin ice. Parvati, in my opinion, is the most dangerous player on our tribe. <br/>And it's not that we're cool or nothing-- me and Parvati. It's because, uh, she's a good asset to the team. <br/>For him to be following around Parvati is no strategy at all. It's puppy love. She's got the charm. She's got the smile. For some reason, when she pays attention to you, you feel like you light up. It's not that people don't see it. It's just that they are allured by her charm, and they're taken by it. They're smitten by it. They're smitten by it. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. <br/>What's the deal? <br/>What's the deal? <br/>Uh...  Uh...  About what? <br/>Who can kind of...  Uh, ultimately, I'm trying to get a feel on Russell on what he's thinking  about Parvati, and.. <br/>And not for nothing, but I've seen this go down before. You got to be careful, you know, the way you're hanging out with her and everything. <br/>Yeah, I know. <br/>And I mean, she might... she might not be the strongest, and she got a lot of  friends on the other side. <br/>Right. <br/>And we see you marching around with her, so...  Yeah. <br/>...you have to understand our concern. <br/>Oh, I understand it. <br/>Am I right, or am I right? <br/>Yeah, you're totally right, and it's like it's ostracizing you. <br/>Right. <br/>And you got to be cool on that, man. that, man. <br/>Man. <br/>Man. <br/>I mean, what else can you do? <br/>You've got to do it. I have no choice. That would be my... the end of my game... Everybody knows Coach is a big  joke, so he can go around flapping his jaws all he wants. The thing with Rob-- he thinks he's the boss of the camp, like that's my  daddy. Well, I'm the daddy around here. But I got to listen to this fool like he's in control. But that's what I have to do to get to the top. That's what I'm going to have to do until he's gone. He don't know who he's messing with. Nobody knows who they're messing with around here. It's Russell Hantz. It's Russell Hantz. Give me a break! Give me a break! <br/>And he's, like, "No, no. She'll know something's coming. man. Just keep doing what you're doing, brother." "Keep doing what  you're doing."  Wow. <br/>He is after you. <br/>He is demented. <br/>I didn't want your name to even be on the block. It worries me because of that, so I was... I was even trying to convince him...   I'm used to it, honestly. <br/>I was even trying to convince him another way. <br/>I've dodged a few bullets. Why do they always want to vote me out? I don't know. I'm just a sweet, innocent, little girl, really. [laughs]  And then Rob came over there and said, "Give us your word you'll get rid  of her." I said, "Dude, do you seriously think I'm here to hook up  with a girl? I mean, please."  I made an alliance really early on with Russell, and so, I don't know what  I'm going to have to do, but who else am I going to be with right now besides  Russell? I don't trust anyone, and I actually do trust him, even though he's kind of a  lunatic. <br/>I said I'll show you how to get rid of her, and we'll get rid of her-- and  then y'all can trust me then, so she's gone. Okay? And that's it. [Parvati laughs]  If I'm gone, you're gone next. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You know that. <br/>You know that. <br/>Yeah. Bye. <br/>Yeah. Bye. <br/>So I'm three days out, basically, from the, you know, 95 degrees, hot as  hell, started throwing up. My gums were, like, bleeding a little bit. I mean, I started getting these big sores on my face. I'm, like, all right, what's this? <br/>Is this the same story as last night? <br/>Not the same story, my friend. <br/>It's not? It's awful similar. <br/>No, it's not, trust me. <br/>Okay. <br/>So it took me eight days to get from, uh... de Los Angeles... Yeah, I had my  compass set on, uh, east-due-east, and I was hoping I would make it. So...  [chuckles]: Rob thinks he's running the show, and Coach thinks he's running  the show. But I'm gonna take control of that. They want to play rough? I can play rough. King Rustall can get rid of the machete. You know what happens then? Getting rid of the machete will cause conflict in this camp. Rob's going to go crazy. The tribe's going to go crazy. Everything's going to go haywire. Can't find the machete, can't eat the chickens, can't open the coconuts,  can't start fire. And that's a good thing. <br/>95 degrees, hot as hell, and I was thinking to myself, what am I going to do? I've got no water. <br/>This is going to be wonderful, 'cause it's not just going to be the machete. Old Boston Rob likes that hat, don't he? I think he will go nuts without his little "B" hat. I don't even like the Boston Red Sox. Red Sox. It's the Houston Astros, baby. It's the Houston Astros, baby. It's the Houston Astros, baby. <br/>COACH: Oh...  COACH: Oh...  I... Give you... Give you... All of my strength. All of my strength. <br/>Who wants clam? Russell, Rob, Parvati? Nobody? <br/>I'm fine without a clam right now. <br/>Courtney? 'Cause I don't want it to spoil 'cause it's out of the water and I don't want  it to... you know, go to waste, and I don't want to eat it all, either. <br/>Well, just eat a little bit of it and throw it away. <br/>All right. <br/>All right. <br/>Machete? <br/>Machete? <br/>Machete? <br/>Damn. <br/>Damn. I did find one giant clam that was good for five or six bites of food, but  nobody cared. You know, I'm used to seeing on Survivorwhere somebody brings a fish in this  size, and the entire tribe swarms him hoping to get an ounce of meat, and you  eat what you can eat when you can get it and you don't ask questions, 'cause  you don't know where your next food is coming from. <br/>Randy, this thing cuts good. <br/>Ew. <br/>Got to eat. You don't like it? <br/>You want a white piece? Of this? [Parvati spits]  Sorry. <br/>No? <br/>I can't eat it. It makes me gag. <br/>No, we're not gonna waste this on you. <br/>Mm-mm, don't do it. <br/>We won't. [laughter]  Survivor,in so many ways, is like the real world-- you don't get ahead by  being smart... clever, hardworking. You get ahead, unfortunately, with a pretty smile and being able to schmooze  people. And Parvati is the queen. You know, this whole game is designed to mess with everybody's nerves, and it  works. <br/>The team's only as good as its weakest player. And that's why we never get anything done around camp. Because the weakest players just sit there and think that they can look  pretty and cute and have everything handed to them. Right? <br/>Well... let's vote them out. <br/>I personally can't stand it when I see people that are loafers and people  that are weak. It's not fair. It's just simply unjust. And it's selfish, and it's egotistical that "I can do nothing, sit back,  feed me grapes like a Greek goddess." It's just... the whole thing It's  just... the whole thing just stinks. just stinks. <br/>You know, I think you're a great player, and, um... I'd like to make it to  the end. <br/>Yeah, I do, too. <br/>But if somebody's not talking to me strategy, they're talking to somebody  else. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>And when you come talking with somebody on the day we're going to Tribal  Council, that doesn't count. You know what I mean? 'Cause you need a favor then. <br/>Candice is beginning to scare me a lot. She's much more strategical than I gave her credit for to begin with. <br/>I think Cirie is trustworthy if... she feels safe within...  If she feels safe. Candice may be the next one to go, in my opinion, but, you know, it's not all  up to me. Not in this group. <br/>What are your thoughts? Everything still good? <br/>It's hard to trust anyone out here right now. out here right now. <br/>Mm. Tell me about it. <br/>Mm. Tell me about it. [laughs]  Okay. <br/>I got her. I can get rid of her. [laughs] I can tell a story when I need to. I think my lying ability is... probably better than it should be. Considering I don't do it very much in everyday life, I'm pretty good at it  out here. [water splashing]  I'm-I'm nervous now. <br/>About what? <br/>About us. <br/>You're nervous about me and you? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Why? What...  I hear-hear stuff. <br/>Tell me what you hear. <br/>That you don't trust me, and...  Who said that? [Cirie laughs]  I don't want to say who said it-- I just want to...  Well, it doesn't matter who said it, 'cause it's not true. I'm thinking, where did that come from, because I have never said that. Either somebody is trying to make sure that she and I don't trust each other,  or I'm thinking there's something weird going on. Did you tell Cirie in any way that... I said or that I don't trust her? <br/>Absolutely not. <br/>Okay. She's hearing around that I said I don't trust her. <br/>I've never heard you talk bad about Cirie. bad about Cirie. <br/>No, and I haven't. <br/>No, and I haven't. Cirie just told me that somebody is telling her that I said I don't trust her. <br/>I don't have any idea what you're talking about. I just wish you would just chill out just for a second, just for a little  while, and then we'd be all right. Candice, I mean, she's a nut. Everybody's going to play with Candice 'cause she's hustling a little bit too  much. I don't know what's wrong with the girl. Like, I don't even care about the whole... we can't even focus on all that  stuff right now. It's pointless to even worry about all that. I just want to get to I just want to get to challenges and win. challenges and win. challenges and win. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Villains getting your first look at the new Hero tribe. Stephenie voted out at the last Tribal Council. <br/>Oh...

For today's challenge, you are going to square off, one on one, sumo style. Using a large, heavy bag, you will attempt to knock your opponent into the  mud. Two rules-- you must keep both hands on the bag at all times; cannot use your  legs as a weapon. First tribe to score eight wins immunity, safe from the vote. Losers go to Tribal Council, where somebody will be voted out of this game. In addition, you are once again playing for reward, and it is a doozy. First, we have luxury items. Each of you brought one item from home to remind you of the love you left  behind. In addition, you are playing for coffee, sugar...  Coffee! <br/>Probst: ...and a week's worth of rice. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Villains, you are sitting out two people. You must sit out two women. <br/>Me and Courtney. <br/>Probst: Courtney and Sandra sitting out. You two take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize and change minute to  strategize and change clothes if you like. clothes if you like.

[whooping]  Yeah, that was real heroesque. <br/>Real classy. <br/>Get your ... out of there. <br/>I told you, you were on the wrong team, James. <br/>Probst: Heroes, congratulations.

Enjoy the night off from Tribal. Cirie's got the cleanest hands. <br/>Yes, you take that. <br/>Probst: Villains, Tribal Council for you guys. One of the ten of you will be the third person voted out of this game. Should be an interesting afternoon. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. I will see you at Tribal. [laughter]  Oh, dude. Feel your hair. <br/>Dude, come on! <br/>Oh, my God, it's a lot of mud. <br/>Yeah, those Heroes were waiting to wallop on us a bit. I guess they must have all eaten steroid sandwiches right before the, uh...  the challenge. They were all crazy-eyed, and, uh, it was almost scary to look in their faces. Not that it was intimidating, but I worried for their sanity. <br/>There you go. <br/>A mess. Everyone's a mess. <br/>Little pigpen. From the, uh... the Muppets? <br/>The Peanuts. <br/>Peanuts. <br/>You don't even have to be told that your name is on the block. You can just sense it. I'm the oldest guy in the game, I'm the oldest guy in this tribe, and Russell  and Boston Rob and probably Tyson are falling for the oldest trick in the  book since cave man days that these girls can get what they want if they bat  their eyes and flirt. <br/>Scrubbing is involved. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Parvati is a threat right now, even though she may be in a minority in this  tribe. But if we overlook her because she's got a pretty smile and a nice wiggle,  she's going to be trouble when she meets up with her old friends James, Cirie  and Amanda. And we could all pay dearly for not taking care of business right now, and by  taking care of business, I mean getting her of business, I mean getting her  out of here as soon as possible. out of here as soon as possible. <br/>No, I'm... I have not made my bet yet. <br/>Answer the question. <br/>Answer the question. <br/>I have not made my bet yet. <br/>I have not made my bet yet. <br/>I hardly ever even talk strategy. The only person I talk strategy with is Randy, because he's a a super fan. <br/>Oh, Coach, please. Every time I see you, you're running around grabbing someone, trying to talk  to them. <br/>That is not true. That is totally not true. That is not true. I don't lie. You know, Parvati came at me real aggressive in the water today saying,  "You know, are you targeting me?" I kept trying to fend off her  question, and yet she thinks that she can bat her eyelashes and wiggle her  hips and roll down a very short bathing suit already to make it even more  skimpy, and everybody will follow her around. Well, maybe Russell will, maybe other people will. Maybe Tyson will. I sure as hell won't. <br/>I don't want to go, and I don't think I'm the weakest. I think I would be a poor choice to go. I think you could use me to your advantage. <br/>That stuff doesn't work on me. I've been coaching college soccer for women for 13 years, and I've never had  one of those girls bat their eyes at me and make a difference in their make a  difference in their playing time. playing time. <br/>Never. Fear's never controlled me, and flirting has never controlled me. I'm my own man. <br/>Really? <br/>I'm going to make my decision...  I just want you to know. I don't think any flirting controls anyone. <br/>But I do like flirting with you. <br/>I think it's ridiculous that people think that. <br/>So out here with a million dollars on the line, certainly isn't going to  happen. And anybody that lets it happen will be a fool. <br/>Parvati has too many friends on the other side, and they're controlling that  game over there. Randy has no friends anywhere, here or there. She's dangerous. Randy is not dangerous. What do you think? <br/>Amanda, come here. Are you hearing this? <br/>I heard him. It has to be a group effort. It can't be two or three going... You know what I'm saying? <br/>I know. <br/>Like, it has to be the majority, and what is the majority? Randy is weak. Why would we want to weaken our tribe? <br/>I just know she has a ton of friends over there. <br/>I'd rather take Randy out than Parvati. <br/>So, let's make a decision. People are coming. <br/>Parvati is like a virus. That girl needs to go. She has a way of just, like, roping people in, even when they don't want  anything to do with her. I'm going to find out how to bottle that up and use it in my real life,  'cause it's pretty powerful stuff. <br/>I'm safe tonight. You're safe tonight. We know the two people whose names are there, um, and I don't know what to do. You know? I don't know where you're at. <br/>I'm going to tell you like this. I'm not in trouble. <br/>I don't want to, either. <br/>Therefore, I don't need...  I feel the same way. <br/>All I'm going to do is, where's everybody at? Boom, that's it, done. That's it. If they all want him out, that's who I'll write. If they all want her out, that's who I'll write. That's it. Let me go do this thing. Let me go do this thing. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>It doesn't matter, either. It's just a matter... He's, obviously, the weakest link, so...  Yeah. I mean, this is a lot of...  We don't have to play that card, but a lot of people want to, and that's...  it's overall just...  I know, but I'm just going to say it again because... Everyone... I think  everyone has their own strength...  Yeah, but if we vote him out tonight, they'll have to sit out one of their  strong guys in the next challenge, so that will give us a fighting chance. <br/>I mean, we don't know. <br/>Yeah, you don't know. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm just saying that  I'm just saying that that's... that's...  Well, if you're going to say not Randy, then you have to say someone else? <br/>I don't have to say. <br/>Why not? <br/>Because I don't know. I'm just trying to figure out what's going on. <br/>Well, but if you're trying to get someone to vote for someone, you have to  say who. <br/>I'm not trying to get anybody to vote for anybody yet. I don't know what's going on, honestly. Moments like that drive me up the wall. That girl-- she thinks that she can make people do whatever she wants, and  people are, but I'm not. I am not. I'm at the point right now, where every time I'm around here, I just want to  punch her in the face. That's all I can think about is just taking her down. Boy, I'll tell you what. <br/>Jerri's annoying. [laughs] I mean, she is the fakest Fakey McGee I've ever met. I know she's running around behind my back talking about me. She's just, like, a bitter old cougar, and I think her days are numbered, too. <br/>I loved it when I saw Stephenie gone, 'cause that should make it clear to you  what's going on. It should make it clear to Rob what's going on. If you guys don't see that, you're next. I don't have a clue what you were talking to Parvati about, and I don't even  want to know. But... this is Micronesia 2.0. <br/>Oh, it is. <br/>And if you guys don't see that, I don't want to play the game with you  anymore, I really don't. I'm not going to scramble today like a dead man walking, because...  No, I'm gonna be scrambling. <br/>Because if I am dead man walking... [laughs] a lot of my friends are next. And, you know, I'll see you in Loser's Lodge. I'll buy you a beer. <br/>There's nobody out here that's honorable. There's nobody out here that's honorable... anymore. Except for me. I hate to pontificate about that but, you know, Martin Luther King says that  the greatest measure of a man is not in the way he handles times of comfort,  but in the way he rises with controversy and challenge. There's always hope. The last thing we have in life or in this game is hope that the impossible  happens, that we dare to dream, that Randy's going to wake up in this camp  tomorrow. So yes, there's still hope. While I still have a breath and a brain cell in my brain, I a brain cell in  my brain, I will fight for him. will fight for him. <br/>Probst: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab one. Dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council, because in this game fire  represents your life. As long as you have fire, you're still in the game. When your fire is gone, so are you. Sandra, when you play a game like this with 20 people who have all played--  some two, some three times-- how big a consideration is past relationships,  whether within this tribe or people that are on the other tribe? <br/>There's a lot of things we take into consideration. One, who's won before. Who's been out here three times. Who has friends on another tribe. For instance, with Parvati, we're thinking, okay, Cirie's over there, James  is over there, Amanda's over there. Like, how far do we want them to go, and then, once we merge, are we screwed? <br/>Probst: Parvati, you're shaking your head. <br/>Yeah, everyone's nervous about me flipping if a merge comes. All I can say is that I want to stick true to this tribe. But, you know, it's words, and in this game, your word doesn't mean that much. It's really your actions that matter. <br/>Probst: Russell, what kind of weight do you give that? <br/>I think it is a huge advantage that somebody might know three or four people  on the other tribe. It's a huge advantage. <br/>Probst: Jerri, do you think tonight's vote should be based on performances at  challenges? <br/>I think the physical side of this is very important for us. This is our first loss, and we don't want to lose any more. But I know myself I'm still taking into account all the other factors,  relationships and all that sort of thing. <br/>Probst: So for you, past relationships, whether within your own tribe or the  other tribe, is a big factor? <br/>I think it should be a big factor for everyone. <br/>Probst: Sandra, is there a leader on this tribe? <br/>Well, it all depends on what we're doing. If we're building the shelter, we start listening to him, and then when it  gets too much, then we go off on our own. And then Coach'll delegate, "You do this and I'll do this and we'll go  do that," but then when you look, Coach is gone two miles out. <br/>Sandra, you only mentioned me in that, and I don't know if it's a jibe at me,  but that's a bunch of bull. I collected firewood for three hours, thank you very much. Nobody's out there collecting firewood like I am. I've been working hard around camp, and I resent you for saying that. In fact, why do you think we have the worst shelter in Survivorhistory? Because it's like herding cats. <br/>It's not the worst shelter in Survivorhistory-- I was in that one, actually. <br/>I'd argue that I was also a part of one of those contenders. <br/>I want to say one other thing to Sandra. If you think I'm not pulling my weight around camp and in the challenges,  then put my name down on the paper tonight. <br/>No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. <br/>Well, that's what you made it sound like. You made it sound like I'm an ass that sits there that wants to be a leader  and then doesn't do any work. <br/>And we ain't got a machete! We haven't had a machete all day. <br/>Probst: What do you mean, you have no machete? <br/>It grew legs and walked off. [Probst laughs]  We have three chickens, though. <br/>Probst: Parvati, you guys are literally laughing about how bad it is at camp. <br/>We're kind of a tribe full of misfits, Jeff. We're the Villains. <br/>Russell, what are you making of this tribe you're on? <br/>It's definitely different. The dodos I played with last time couldn't hold a candle to any one of these  players. <br/>Mm...  So it's fun, but it's a lot harder, because you have everybody playing the  game. But that's what I like, and that's what I want to see, and that's what I  respect. <br/>Probst: Rob, given how well you guys have done overall at the challenges so  far, I'm a little surprised at the lack of cohesiveness within the group. Do you think just coming to Tribal Council alone will impact that when you  guys go back to camp? <br/>No. I don't think so. I think that when we have a challenge, we know what we have to do, and we  figure out a way very quickly on how to accomplish it. At camp, it's a different story. There's nobody to tell us, "You need to make your shelter better,"  or "You need to collect firewood." There's not that sense of  urgency. So I don't think it will change. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to vote. time to vote. Russell, you're up. Russell, you're up. <br/>It was either you or me tonight, and I wasn't gonna go tonight, and I wasn't  gonna go down without a fight. down without a fight. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote... Randy. Rob. One vote Rob. Randy. Randy. Two votes Randy, one vote Rob. Two votes Randy, one vote Rob. Randy. That's three votes Randy, one vote Rob. Randy. Four votes Randy, one vote Rob. Randy. That's five votes Randy, one vote Rob. Third person voted out of Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains... Randy. That's six; that's enough. That's six; that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Randy, the tribe has spoken. Randy, the tribe has spoken. Well, even though we're only eight days into the game, if you don't get your  camp life together, it will catch up to you, and you will be coming back to  Tribal, and more people will be going home. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor: Coach melts down. <br/>Why does nobody say anything good about me? <br/>I think I'll go this way. <br/>Probst: The Hero tribe splinters apart while looking for the hidden immunity  idol. <br/>This is not a group effort. It's every man for himself. <br/>Probst: And the clock is ticking on Russell. <br/>Russell's a bonehead. <br/>Russell's a bonehead. It's time for him to go home. It's time for him to go home. <br/>It was definitely a mistake for this tribe not to vote out Parvati, but I  knew Parvati wasn't gonna go home, so I decided to shoot a bullet Bob's way,  send a little message. Whether anybody gets that message, I don't know. I hope it comes back and haunts each and every one of them. I never felt a part of this tribe, so, you know, good luck tribe, so, you  know, good luck to them.
