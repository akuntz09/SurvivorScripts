<br/> Jeff: Previously on Survivor...  Welcome to Survivor: Nicaragua. Since the beginning of the game, Chase has been a portrait of indecision. On day one, he was Shannon's closest ally. Without me or you, I think they're screwed. <br/>Jeff: But later voted  him out. <br/>I'm sorry, dude. I owe a lot to you. <br/>Jeff: Shannon, the  tribe has spoken. He had a puppy dog crush on Brenda. <br/>There's no reason for  me to backstab you. <br/>Jeff: And eventually  voted her out. <br/>You know this isn't  what I wanted at all. <br/>What the... Is wrong  with Chase? <br/>Jeff: Despite Chase's  indecisiveness, NaOnka liked him enough to give him her hidden immunity idol... You my boy. I wouldn't give it to nobody else. <br/>Jeff: ...Right before  she quit. You want to go? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Go. Which brings us to day 30. Chase was in an alliance with Holly, Jane, and Sash, who had the other hidden  immunity idol. <br/>I got the reassurance  from Chase that we're definitely together all the way to the end. <br/>Shake on it, look me  in the eye. <br/>Jeff: But Benry also  thought he was in with Chase. <br/>We're talking Fabio. <br/>Jeff: So Chase  conspired with Benry and the rest of his crew to vote out Fabio. But at tribal council, Chase decided that Benry was a bigger threat. <br/>Nothing personal at  all, man. I love you to death. <br/>Jeff: Benry was voted  out. Benry, the tribe has spoken. Six are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Fabio is just happy  to be alive. He saw his name was put down twice. He really thought he was going home. He knows that I'm in control of this game right now, and as long as Fabio  doesn't win a challenge, he will definitely be the next to go. <br/>They said I was  trying to get Holly off? You know, the next couple of days are going to be really tricky. I think they believe I'm more gullible and naive than I am, you know. But it's to the point where I'm on, like, high alert right now. It would be pretty funny to watch them underestimate me and they're kind of  like, "What? I didn't know Fabio was that smart." We've got a cell  phone! <br/>Oh! <br/>It's tree mail. <br/>Okay, read it. <br/>"To fill your  belly and quench your thirst, today you'll have to be the first. This reward today is a major score. It will take you places you've never seen before. Go to videos, a surprise awaits." Wow. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>What? <br/>Okay, so how do you  go to video? <br/>Let's go to videos. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>I gotta get my  glasses. <br/>It's my mom and my  brother. <br/>Honey, I can't wait  to see you. I told you before you went that I've never gone this long without talking to  you, and I want to hear your voice, and all the excitement of the adventure  that you've been doing. <br/>We're playing a game  for a million dollars, and something as simple as a sprint cell phone can  bring you to tears. <br/>Your mom is beautiful. <br/>Oh, my God. That's awesome. <br/>That's my mom next. <br/>That's your mom? <br/>Yeah, that's my mom. <br/>Hi, Sash. How are you? I'm so happy I have this chance to be able to tell you how much I miss you. You just have continually been in my thoughts and in my heart. <br/>It was very  interesting to see how everyone reacted to their own family because it makes  you realize you're playing this game with people, not just other competitors. And they miss their family just as much as I do. <br/>Hey, mom! How you doing? I hope you're winning. And I hope you enjoy the crappy rice you're eating. We all miss you here, and the go-kart broke again, just so you know. [laughter] Hi, dad. How are you? Nice to be able to talk to you. <br/>Dad, we miss you. We love you. Amazing how many people have called me saying they haven't gone this long in  their life without being yelled at by you. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Holly, we all know  you're doing absolutely fantastic, but we miss you terribly. And the one thing I'm really looking forward to is putting my arms around you  as soon as I possibly can, honey. Love you. <br/>I miss him so much. <br/>I have always been so  proud to be your mother and that goes double for today. You have... You have an inner strength and a personality that is generous and  intelligent. <br/>I know that my family  is, like, number one and being out here has really given me time to think  about that. But actually seeing the video, it really got me, man. My mom always says the perfect thing, man. She told me exactly what I needed to know, and... I just want to see my  family, man. I really do. <br/>Us three young guys. <br/>Is that... I want to  take you and Sash. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Just me, you, and Sash. We could get one reward together. We haven't had one, the three of us at all. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>So. <br/>Oh, yeah, I promise. <br/>That's what I'd like. <br/>It will be us three,  you, me, and Sash. <br/>Yeah, that's what I'm  going for, so... Jeff: Come on in,  guys! Good morning! <br/>Good morning! <br/>Good morning! <br/>Jeff: Well, this  morning in tree mail you received the evo by sprint. It's the first 4g phone out there and it contains some wonderful messages  from your loved ones back home. Holly, how was it to hear from family? <br/>It was very emotional  but it was also very inspirational to hear their words of encouragement. I'm so ready for the next six days. <br/>Jeff: All right, I  will take it back. Win today's challenge, and you can take the evo by sprint to a place you've  never been before. The winner of today's challenge will set sail down the coast of Nicaragua. While you're there, you'll enjoy a nice meal. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: Sandwiches,  some cookies, champagne, a little beer if you want, some chips. <br/>Oh man! <br/>Jeff: And to make it  even more special, you're going to have some gorgeous company, your loved  ones. [gasps] Chase, here's your mom, connie. <br/>Where? Oh, my God! <br/>How are you? Honey, I love you. <br/>I love you, too. <br/>Are you doing okay? <br/>I love you, mom. <br/>I love you, too,  honey. I'm so proud of you. <br/>Jeff: How does he  look, mom? <br/>He looks good. He's handsome as can be. <br/>Jeff: All right,  connie, you can join him over there on the mat. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: Fabio, who  would you like to see? <br/>Anybody, man. Any... My mom, dad. <br/>Jeff: Fabio, here's  your mom, anne. <br/>I love you so much,  mom. I love you so much. <br/>Oh, I love you too. <br/>I think about you  guys every day. <br/>We think about you  all the time. <br/>Look at you. Gorgeous. <br/>Jeff: Anne, we should  tell you that the son you formally knew as Jud is now Fabio. [laughs] That's a good  nickname. They used to call him "Jud the stud." Jeff: Only a mom can  say that and get away with it. <br/>I love you. <br/>Jeff: We have one  more mom who wants to say hello. Sash, here's your mom, lee. <br/>Oh, Sash! <br/>Oh, my God! Oh! It's so good to see you. <br/>Jeff: Sash, tell me  about your relationship with your mom. You guys look very close. <br/>Growing up we didn't  have much money, but we have a lot of love and being out here really makes me  realize that's all you need in life is a little bit of love to get by. And she's my... My best friend. <br/>Jeff: I think it's  time we got a kid out here. Dan, here's your son, matthew. <br/>Dan! There he is! <br/>Oh, God! Oh, God. <br/>Jeff: Dan, tell me  about growing up. What was the culture like in your family? <br/>My two sons have been  my life. They really have been my life. They made me so proud. I do a lot of crazy things, and they're always so proud of me, no matter what  I do, they're, "Dad, dad, dad." this is so special. I want to thank you so much. <br/>Jeff: I am so touched  by the affection that matthew is showing you. He can't stop kissing you. <br/>He's my dad! <br/>Jeff: All right, take  a spot on the mat. We've got another kid that wants to say hi to her mom. Jane, here's your daughter, ashley. <br/>Come on, ashley! [screaming] you made it! She had a lot to do with my farm. It's just me and her now against the world since her father passed away. So, yeah, I left her in charge of my place. <br/>Jeff: How's your mom  look? <br/>Skinnier than hell. <br/>Jeff: All right, so  everybody's had their loved one. <br/>We got one more. <br/>Jeff: Oh, one more. I'm sorry, Holly. Who do you want to see? <br/>My husband. <br/>Jeff: All right,  charlie, come on! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: There's your  man! <br/>We missed our 25th  wedding anniversary for me to be out here so this is unbelievable. <br/>Jeff: 25 years. <br/>I can't believe she  stayed with me all these 25 years, either. <br/>Jeff: All right, love  birds, take a spot on the mat. <br/>Okay. <br/>I can't believe it! <br/>Jeff: Loved ones, if  you've enjoyed seeing your Survivors for a moment, you're going to have to  work to spend a little more time with them because you are going to  participate in today's challenge. Here's how it works. On my go, the Survivors will run up a plank, jump into the water to retrieve  a bag of letter tiles. You'll race it back to give to your loved one. You'll go back and get a second bag. Once you've collected both bags, the loved ones will use the letters to solve  a familiar phrase. First one to get it right wins reward. You guys ready for this? <br/>Yeah, all right! [whooping] Jeff: All right,  we're going to draw for spots. We'll get started. All right, here we go. For reward. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, Holly, go. <br/>Come on, Chase! <br/>Jeff: Survivors got  to get the bag and get back. Fabio first out. Chase right behind. Sash is in it. <br/>Come on, honey, hurry. <br/>Good job, Holly, good  job, good job. Got it, go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: Fabio and Chase  are back and have their second bag before Dan is even out of the water. <br/>Dad, you got it. <br/>Jeff: Everybody back  with their first bag except Dan. Fabio's mom has both bags. Chase's mom has both bags. <br/>Come on, Sash! <br/>Jeff: Sash's mom is  working on the puzzle. Holly's husband, charlie, has both bags. Jane's daughter's working on the puzzle. Dan is the last one left. Get that bag! <br/>You got it, dad! Come on, dad! You got it. <br/>Good, Danny boy. <br/>Jeff: That a way, Dan. Keep fighting. Show that son what you're made of. <br/>There you go, dad. <br/>Jeff: Now Dan's son,  matthew, is in it. Everybody working on their puzzle now. <br/>Family visit time. <br/>Don't say it! <br/>Jeff: You don't want  to be yelling anything out because everybody has ears here. <br/>Family, family first. <br/>Jeff: Fabio's mom,  anne, falling behind. Jane's daughter, ashley, falling behind. Sash's mom has something going. Chase's mom, connie, making good progress. Charlie's got something going with Holly. Chase's mom getting closer. <br/>Done. <br/>Jeff: Connie, you  think you have it? Family comes first! Chase and connie going on reward! <br/>Oh! <br/>We were close. <br/>Jeff: Chase, connie,  come on over. <br/>Good job, you guys. <br/>Jeff: Good work out  there, mom. <br/>Thanks. I like to play games. <br/>Jeff: All right, Chase  and connie, you're going to leave here, take a nice cruise down the coast of Nicaragua,  have some nice food, make some great memories. I want to you choose somebody to come with you, one Survivor and their loved  one. <br/>Just one? <br/>He's probably going  to pick Sash. <br/>I love all of you, I  know that. I love each and every one of you. There's one person who hasn't been on a reward in a long time, and that's Sash. And I believe he deserves it. [applause] Jeff: Sash, come on  over. <br/>Thank you, Chase. <br/>I love each one of  you guys. <br/>Jeff: Chase, bring  one more person with you, one more Survivor and their loved one. <br/>I know this is going  to hurt some people's feelings. I'm going to take Holly. <br/>Jeff: Holly and  charlie, come on over. <br/>Honeymoon today. <br/>What happens to the  rest of them? <br/>Jeff: They will be  taken and executed. As with any good challenge. Fabio, you're really upset. <br/>Yeah, man. I don't get to see her a whole lot. So it meant a lot to me. <br/>Jeff: You guys live  in different states? <br/>Fabio, I love you,  man. I'm so sorry, man. <br/>No, man, you know I  would have taken you and your mom because I know how much your mom means to  you, dude. <br/>I know, dude. <br/>You know that; that  was... Shhh! <br/>Fabio, man... I'm not going to cry  about it. <br/>It's okay. <br/>Jeff: All right,  loved ones, say good-bye to your Survivors. <br/>I love you. [indistinct conversations] Jeff: All right,  guys, hit it. All right, Jane, Fabio, Dan, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff; head back to camp. All right, Chase, got a nice reward in store for you. Take the evo by sprint. Use it to record all the great memories you guys are going to make. <br/>Video, picture? <br/>Jeff: Everything. Have a great time out there, you guys. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Head on out. <br/>Are you hungry? <br/>I'm starving. <br/>Why do you think he  continues to choose Holly for these? <br/>Evidently, he thinks  our useful life with him is over. That's what he thinks. You could see it today. How many times does he want to suck up to Holly? He has no allegiance to us. He's done with this three. <br/>He told me numerous  times... He's told people a  lot of things. <br/>He's like,  "Yeah, fab, you know..." he knew how much my mom meant to me and I  knew how much his meant and he was going to take me. Even today we talked. I was really let down by Chase because we had been talking about, you know,  having our moms and this one reward, and he knew how much my mom meant to me  and I knew how much his mom meant to him, and I was really planning on taking  him. So I kind of got played there. He straight up lied to me. <br/>Forget you, forget me. He did it to Jane. <br/>I know, that's the  thing. <br/>Ashley is going to be  going off to college. I spent my whole summer here. This is ashley's last summer at home. <br/>Yeah, he made a  million-dollar decision to lose it. Chase won the challenge, and he really did a bad thing to Jane. He really let her down. Just shows you what a... He is. You know, he's been her friend, and then he just spits in her face today. It was disgusting. <br/>He told you straight  up he was taking you? <br/>Yeah. <br/>He doesn't have a  brain. I said it from the beginning. <br/>I mean, it really  hurts. <br/>Yeah, Jane, I know. <br/>Well, Jane... My swimsuit's falling  off in that damn challenge! I got mad at Chase for not picking me. Where I stand right now, it appears that I'm the fourth person in a four-way  alliance, and that worries me. <br/>What's this,  watermelon? <br/>I see cookies. <br/>Cookies. <br/>I see beer and  champagne. [whooping] Oh, my God! <br/>Wow! <br/>Let's share a cookie,  honey. I'm assuming that we are not going to have any more food challenges and we're  going to be here the next four days without food. So I needed that to get some of my energy back. All I know is I appreciate food a lot more than I ever have. <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>Sash, you've gone  almost two weeks without a meal. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Thanks for picking  us, Chase. <br/>Chase, thank you so  much. I can't tell you how much this means. <br/>Final three, right  here. Let's make it happen. <br/>Let's cheers water at  the moment. We'll drink some champagne later to cheers the final three. <br/>We've got to stick to  our plan. We've got to stick to our plan. <br/>It just shows you  all, I could have tried to get jury votes. I'm sticking with you. <br/>We know. <br/>I had to choose,  really, between Holly, Jane and Fabio. We all want Fabio gone next because he can ruin our plan. <br/>We're planning on  going the final three, right here. <br/>Fabio is very  emotional but I want to keep Holly close. I want to make sure she helps take me to the end so hopefully it doesn't bite  me in the butt with jury votes if I get that far. If it included a hidden immunity idol... Sash and myself. <br/>So will it be you  three against the other three when you go back? <br/>No. The three of us are in an alliance and we have one other person in our  alliance, Jane. <br/>Really? Okay. <br/>But we've made a  commitment to each other. The three of us. <br/>Mind-boggling. [whooping] Survivors! <br/>I think you all are  amazing, and I'm proud of all of you, and I wish you all good luck. Chase, win. [laughter] Cheers. <br/>Everyone's looking  good. Done. <br/>Okay, are you ready? Cheers. Oh, that's awesome. <br/>So you've got to go,  huh? <br/>Yep. <br/>It was unbelievable  spending the afternoon with charlie. Him just holding me in his arms. It just felt amazing. I will never look at a hug from charlie the same. <br/>Okay, I love you. <br/>Bye. <br/>I wanted to let loose  and let my mom know I'm doing okay, have a good time with her,  once-in-a-lifetime experience. But in the back of my mind I was saying, damn, I have to go back to camp and  face wrath. <br/>Bye! <br/>Love you, mama. <br/>Yo, Chase. What's up? <br/>Fabio, man. <br/>How was it, buddy? <br/>It was-- it was  great, man. <br/>What do you mean? <br/>No, I don't blame you. <br/>Sash and Holly and I  just got back from reward, and immediately Fabio wants to know what the hell  happened, why I didn't take him. I don't blame you. If I was in your shoes, I'd be upset, too. <br/>She lives with her  husband. I see my mom twice a year, bro. <br/>It's true. <br/>I guess we'll move on. You can't hold grudges out here. You can't be super ticked off at somebody because it will come back to get  you. It's over, man. That's fine. So I think the best thing I could do is just try to win immunity. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys! You ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First things  first, Sash, I'll take back the necklace. <br/>Thanks, jeff. <br/>Jeff: Once again,  immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will each be blindfolded. On my go, you will make your way over and under a series of hitching rails to  a station where you will find a shield with several symbols on it. Using only your sense of touch, you must memorize the symbols. You'll then grab the bags of matching symbols and head back to the start. Still blindfolded, you will use those symbols to create a matching shield. Some of the symbols in your bag will feel right but they won't match. First person to get all their symbols in the right spots wins immunity and is  guaranteed a one-in-five shot at winning this game and the million dollars  that goes with it. We'll draw for spots and get started. All right, here we go. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! Under, over, under. To get to your shield. Fabio out to a quick lead. Chase right behind him. Fabio first to the puzzle. Chase is at his puzzle. Study those symbols. You have to memorize their position and their shape. Holly's now at her puzzle. So is Jane. Sash is at his puzzle. Dan is the last one. Jane studies her puzzle and is already heading back. Fabio heading back. Holly's heading back. Sash making his way back. Jane trying to find her way. Fabio now back with all his pieces. Jane back to her shield. Holly back to her shield. You have to take those symbols in the bags and recreate the same shield on  your end. Make sure you have all three bags because without them, you will be short  pieces. Chase really taking his time, really studying. Sash now back at the right shield. Chase making his way back. Dan making his way back. Fabio's starting to put in pieces. Sash puts in a piece, hoping it's right. Jane trying to remember where does it go? Holly struggling, but she's got her last bag. That's going to help. Chase back with all his pieces. Chase trying to make up some time now. Dan is the last one. 36 days, taking its toll. Chase spent a lot of time studying the symbols. Was it worth it? Fabio placing more pieces. Chase starting to place pieces now. It is coming down to Fabio and Chase. Both placing a lot of pieces. The question is, are they right? <br/>Am I right? <br/>Jeff: Fabio thinks he  has it. He does not. That opens the door for Chase. Fabio quickly switching pieces. <br/>Am I right? <br/>Jeff: Fabio thinks he  has it and he does! Fabio wins immunity! <br/>Good job. <br/>Jeff: Fabio, come on  over. <br/>Good job. <br/>Good job, Fabio. <br/>Jeff: When you need  it, you get it. Fabio, congratulations. As for the rest of you, somebody going home. Head back to camp. I'll see you at tribal. Congrats. <br/>Well,  congratulations, Fabio. <br/>Good job, Fabio. <br/>Good job, Fabio. <br/>The only thing that  could have screwed up today's immunity challenge was Fabio winning immunity,  and of course Fabio wins immunity. <br/>I don't know. It was a good one for me. <br/>You did a great job. <br/>I'm just exhausted. <br/>You're exhausted? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Now we're stuck in a  tight spot because we really wanted the biggest threat to go home, being Fabio. So now we have to decide what our next move is. He's done, dude. <br/>What are you saying? I mean... Dan is done. <br/>Why don't we vote Jane  off tonight and Dan tomorrow? <br/>Are you saying that  because you want to keep Jane around still? You've got to think. You got to think. <br/>I'm thinking, dude. <br/>I know, but it's,  like, such a no-brainer. Chase the whole time has said, yeah, I know Jane has to go. I know Jane has to go. And now when it's actually time to do it, he's all thinking about it, and you  can tell he doesn't want to let her go, and it's like, dude, if he doesn't,  like, vote her out or something, this could go down as his worst decision. <br/>Fabio is really pushing  for Jane. I don't think that's in our best interest. I really don't. We're really taking a big risk if we send Jane home. <br/>Well, we know we have  to vote Jane out at some point. Whether it's today or tomorrow. <br/>I think it's a  win-win sending Dan home tonight for you and I. You don't look like you're okay with this. <br/>I think we're leaving  ourselves open to someone sneaking in who shouldn't. <br/>What are they... What  are they saying? <br/>They want Jane out. <br/>Of course. <br/>Without us saying  anything, what do you think? <br/>And, you know, it's a  big deal. If she makes it through, then none of us make a million dollars. This gives us the best chance to make it to the final three. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>And that should be  our focus. <br/>I don't want to write  Jane's name down. I want to keep Jane around to the final four and beat her at the final four,  but now Sash and Holly don't think that's a good idea, so they're going back  on it. <br/>Here she comes now. <br/>But I've got a little  bit of time. I'm still not sure on it. I don't know if this is right or not. <br/>I just want to make  sure we're still... Four people. <br/>Somebody has to go  tonight. It's hard. And... I mean, we still  voting Dan out? That's what I'm asking. Or has it changed? <br/>That's what we need  to discuss. <br/>So is it me? <br/>Is that what we  decided? Because y'all know I don't want to do it, but... Is that what y'all are dead  set on? <br/>This is not easy, you  guys. <br/>Y'all been conniving  this the whole time? <br/>Um... I guess there  has been discussion of voting you out. <br/>The truth is, the  three of us think that you can beat all of us for the million dollars at the  end. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>My alliance have  turned on me. And I'm supposed to go home tonight. And it was supposed to be the final four, us. That was the game plan the whole time. So they're obviously flippers. They're liars. They're cheats. They're backstabbers. I'm most disappointed in my carolina home boy, Chase. If I was Chase, I wouldn't show my ass back in north carolina. I told Sash "Don't even... Look at me." and try to pat me on the  back, like, "Oh, I'm sorry, Jane." no. And if he wants to try to compare me to his mama, uh-uh. I didn't raise my daughter to be a liar and a cutthroat, but she raised a  damn liar. I've not stabbed anybody in the back in this whole game. So I am proud of the way I played this game. [sighs] I got a little bit of thinking to do tonight prior to tribal council. Because I'm not going to give up, but the wrath of Jane will break out tonight. By God, I started it. I put it out! <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring  in the members of our jury. Alina, Marty, Brenda, NaOnka, Purple Kelly, and Benry, voted out at the last  tribal council. Well, Dan, it's getting down to it. It had to be somewhat of a crazy afternoon. I'm guessing. <br/>I mean, there are  things... Listen, never mind. <br/>Jeff: No, no, no, no,  no. Give it to me, or I'll dig. <br/>Before we left  tonight, Jane took a bucket of water and threw it over our fire. <br/>I sure did. I started that fire. And I wanted to be the last woman standing to put the fire out. <br/>Jeff: So this was  sort of a philosophical statement. <br/>Well, can I have my  say? <br/>Jeff: It is your  tribal council. <br/>Well, there's  absolutely no loyalty in tonight's vote. It's full of liars and backstabbers. End of story. <br/>Jeff: End of story? No, just beginning a story. I want more. <br/>Okay, they're going  to vote me out tonight, okay. And I'm going to call some people on some stuff, okay. Holly, you call yourself a coach and a mentor. Yet, you steal $1,400 worth of personal property. Where I come from, you'd go to jail, okay. <br/>Jeff: You're  referring to? <br/>Shoes that belonged  to Danny. Okay? <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: So, Jane,  you're frustrated because... No, it's not that I'm  frustrated. I'm upset that I made an alliance with people who right now are throwing me  under the bus, and yet the four of us had always decided to get rid of these  two and us stay as a foursome. That was the alliance. That's how Benry got voted off. <br/>Jeff: Chase,  alliances are only as good as they are good. So Jane could believe she's in a four-way alliance and not actually be in a  four-way alliance. <br/>No, Jane was in a  four-way alliance, and this afternoon, we set her aside and said that it's in  our best interest to have a shot at winning this game to possibly send her  home. And we told her that. <br/>Jeff: All right, let  me ask the alliance of three that seems to be in charge. If you vote out Jane tonight, who's next? <br/>I would say it's...  Whoever doesn't win immunity next. <br/>Jeff: So it's Fabio  or Dan. <br/>Would you guys agree  with that? <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Would you guys agree  with that? <br/>Jeff: Game is  happening right now. <br/>Holly? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: So you just  conferred in front of the other three, which I gotta hand it to you guys, is  a ballsy, big move. So, Fabio, are you hearing what's happening right now? <br/>It sounds like if I  don't win again, I could be going next. <br/>It's writing on the  wall, Fabio. <br/>Jeff: You have three  people just told you flat out that there is a three-person alliance. There are three other people, Dan, Fabio, and Jane. So let me ask you the question that my mom would want asked, which is why  don't they have their own alliance? Try to do something? Or force a vote? It seems crazy? Jane, what would you suggest to do right now? <br/>Us three vote Holly  out. Because these two have an idol. <br/>Jeff: Okay. Chase and Sash, you both have hidden immunity idols? <br/>Naonka gave it to me. <br/>Jeff: And you brought  yours. <br/>Yes, it's in my bag. <br/>Jeff: Tonight is the  last night you can play an idol, so it would make sense to play it. So, Dan, why not take Jane's advice and say I want a shot to win, not take  fourth. <br/>Yes, it would make  sense for me to form an alliance with Fabio and Jane. Yes, it would. <br/>Jeff: Fabio. <br/>This is crazy. Everybody comes in here thinking one thing, and then you start realizing,  well, you know, we could do this. Three people could tie, and maybe the three-person alliance won't be as  strong as they thought. You know, I always tell myself no matter what happens, I make the best of the  pieces that are there. <br/>Jeff: Holly, we  walked in here with this big proclamation. Jane says, "I'm going home." now we're about to vote, I'm not so  sure that everybody is as comfortable as they were when we started. Are you? <br/>No. Because we came in with a plan. Now their wheels are spinning. So, of course, I'm going to be sitting here nervous now. <br/>Jeff: Chase, the look  on your face is utter confusion. <br/>Um, I don't know what  the hell is going on right now, honestly. <br/>Jeff: All right, Fabio,  you have individual immunity around your neck. I assume you're keeping that. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: You cannot vote  for Fabio. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Dan, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally  the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. Thank you. Thank you. Rules of "Survivor" state if anybody plays the hidden immunity idol  any votes cast against them will not count. These are both good immunity idols. Any votes cast for Chase or Sash will not count. All right, once the votes are read the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Jane. Jane. Two votes Jane. Jane. That's three votes Jane. 13th person voted out and the seventh member of our jury, that's four. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Jane, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Y'all have fun. <br/>Jeff: Well, final  five, you have survived 36 days in this game. You have three days left, and based on everything said tonight, it should be  three of the craziest so far. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for  scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on  "Survivor," with only five players are left, one thing is certain. <br/>Holly has got me  hands down as a threat. <br/>Holly could be a  threat. <br/>Dan is a bigger  threat than Holly. <br/>Chase is a threat. <br/>Sash is a huge threat. <br/>Fabio is a huge  physical threat. <br/>A big threat. <br/>He's one of the  biggest threats? <br/>Jeff: Everyone is a  threat. Join us in a special two-hour season finale. <br/>You find out really  fast what people's true colors are out here. Sash is a big-ass liar. Holly, I lost total respect for her. And Chase, my buddy in crime, I'm very disappointed in. He always promised to take me to the end. I can't believe Chase deciding to turn on me, but that's  "Survivor."
