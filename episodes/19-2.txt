<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor:these 20 castaways were marooned on the  tiny island nation of Samoa. You guys have already been divided into two tribes. Wearing purple, you are Galu; wearing yellow, you're Foa Foa. At their camp, Galu had a communications breakdown. <br/>We have strong male personalities that aren't personalities that aren't  really hearing one another. really hearing one another. <br/>Probst: but Galu's problems were minor compared to Foa Foa's. The yellow tribe's biggest problem is spelled R-U-S-S-E-L-L. Russell's plan is to perpetrate every dirty trick in the book, in order to  win. <br/>They can be my little puppets. When I'm finished with them, just throw them in the trash. <br/>Probst: On their first night, he sabotaged his own camp just to make life  miserable for the others. <br/>I think if I can control how they feel, I can control how they think. <br/>Probst: He made a series secret alliances. <br/>I got an alliance with the dumb short-haired blonde, and an even dumber  long-haired blonde. And the dark-haired girl. I like to call it my dumb-ass girl alliance. <br/>Probst: He constantly lied. <br/>I lived in New Orleans. The storm was a category 5. When it hit, I tried to get out of the house and I realized I wasn't going to  make it. I never lived in New Orleans. It's crazy how you can break their hearts by telling them a lie. <br/>Probst: after Foa Foa lost the immunity challenge, Russell needed a fall guy,  so when Marisa became suspicious of him...  I'm starting to feel like he's pretty slimy. <br/>Probst: He found his sacrificial lamb. <br/>What is that going to make me think? That makes me think I gotta get rid of her. <br/>Vote Marisa. <br/>We're voting off Marisa. <br/>Probst: But not everybody was on board with his scheme. <br/>Marisa. <br/>No. <br/>She's going first. If you stay with me, then you're going to be fine for a long time. <br/>Probst: Unfortunately for Russell, Betsy's a cop and she didn't believe a  word he said. <br/>As a police officer, I usually can get a pretty good read on somebody. And I don't trust Russell. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Betsy went against Russell and targeted Ashley as  the weakest player. <br/>I think Ashley's the weakest. <br/>Probst: But Russell's sway over the others was too strong. First person voted out of Survivor: Samoa,Marisa. Marisa was out, leaving Officer Betsy to return to camp to figure out where  Russell will strike next. 19 are left. 19 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Tribal Council was-- I liked it. I had fun because Marisa's gone for no other reason but me, and that's a fact. If you play with fire, you're going to get burned, and she got burned. I'm excited that Marisa is gone. You know, I don't have to worry about it no more. I don't have to worry about her strong mind. I know that she's a strong woman. [screeching] You can't have that out here. You can't have that out here. I can't have it. I can't have it. <br/>You see, the thing is, I... I was telling you... I didn't do anything for you  not to trust me, nothing. You was going by appearance only, I guess. Or how I was trying to play the game so fast. Which I understand. But I-I mean it, and I even told the people I was with that I want to keep  you around as long as I possibly can. I think you made a huge mistake, and you'll see that later on. <br/>Okay. <br/>Because I was...  All right, as long as we agree that we don't trust each other, but we still  can talk. <br/>Yeah. <br/>All right. <br/>I just don't... You didn't... Why didn't you trust me from the beginning? You're not a threat to me. It would be a perfect thing for me to do. But, anyway...  Okay. <br/>It is what it is. <br/>It is what it is. [laughs] I feel fine that I voted for Ashley last night. I have no regrets. But I think Russ felt very threatened by Marisa. He didn't like her. She spoke her mind, but I'm not afraid to stand up to him at all. He knows where I'm coming from. He knows that I have no faith in him, and I used to. But not after getting to know But not after getting to know him. him. him. [theme song playing] [theme song playing] [theme song playing]  Look at all the rashes. They ate me up. See, you even still look nice. What's wrong with me? Why do I look this bad? <br/>Because you're funky, baby. <br/>Oh, whatever. Funky is the word. Oh, my God. I'm never taking my kids camping. This is crap. I don't know who invented, like, loving the outdoors. Like, who can really love the outdoors when you can be indoors, 'cause this  right here? This is not for me. <br/>Her back's all wet, poor girl. <br/>And then see, look at how I have to walk, like a stick up my butt. Last night was horrible. Lord have, mercy, God, I didn't know it was going to be this hard. I was shaking, I was cold, I was nauseated. I don't know what was happening. All I know is it was not good. Look at that bed. That bed is pitiful. I've been told so many times, "Oh, if you can make it in Detroit, you  can make it anywhere." What, the 'hood? The 'hood is not the woods. The 'hood is not the woods. Ugh! Ugh! <br/>Yeah! I got a lizard! Look, I got him right on the dome, too, man. <br/>Oh, what's up. <br/>Stick a stick down his face  Stick a stick down his face and roast him up. and roast him up. <br/>All right, I just want to make sure everything is good. Last night was a little too chaotic for me. And I was a little shocked by how aggressive you guys were with Marisa last  night. I didn't know that either hatred ran that deep, or that you and Ben were that  close. <br/>Oh, that's not it. It ain't nothing to do with hatred. It's just she was... I thought she would be a real powerful player. Me and Ben was talking about that. I think, man, I trust you way more than Ben. <br/>Do you? <br/>I think Jaison is somebody perfect to bring with you, because he's so calm  and collected. He's an honest guy. He's playing the game, playing the challenges hard. He's quiet, but he's likable. You can't do this alone. You gotta have somebody. So if Jaison is the person that I can trust, then this is going to be real  good. Another thing, man, I think there's an immunity idol in our camp. You gotta keep that a secret. You know, and I should keep it a secret, but the reason I'm telling you is  'cause I trust you, 'cause I'm going to start looking for it. 'Cause if we can find that, dude, without even any clues...  Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>That would be wonderful. <br/>That would be wonderful. <br/>Russell really wants to find this hidden immunity idol. We don't even know if there is an immunity idol that's hidden or going to  come into existence or whatever. So, he's kind of, I guess, trying to launch a preemptive strike on trying to  figure out where that thing would be. <br/>Don't put anything green in this fire. <br/>if I can find that idol, then that would be genius. In the history of Survivor, how many people found the idol without a clue? without a clue? Zero. Zero. <br/>I think you'll like this, Mick. <br/>Yeah, I'm excited. <br/>Pretty tasty. <br/>It's a white meat. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>I cannot believe I'm eating lizard. Oh, my God. <br/>It kind of tastes like chicken/fish. <br/>What's he doing in there? <br/>I'm looking. I'm looking for the immunity idol. These people are so ignorant. Everybody is standing in the same spot. I'm in a big old hole in the tree and I don't want to look suspicious but it  surely does. So I look in the tree, I look up. I almost passed out. I seen it sitting there. So I reached up there and yanked it down, got it loose, put it in my  underwear, turned around and just walked off. The wonderful immunity idol. Boo-yah. <br/>Guess I'm on now, dude. <br/>Ow! <br/>Ow! Is that it? Is that it? <br/>When I looked up, I almost passed out. When I looked up and seen it, I started shaking. <br/>Keep it cool. <br/>And then everybody's standing right there! <br/>I know. How did you get it out of there, put it in your pants? <br/>Boo-ya. <br/>Russell found the idol, so I'm excited we have it. I think it's definitely a tool we can use. <br/>Let me put it on before...  So "this is yours. It can't be taken from you." I'm not sure how I feel about the fact that  he has control of it as opposed to me, but at this point, I think I can trust  Russell a lot more. You and I have still a deal? <br/>Hell, yeah, dude, it's on. I wouldn't have never told you if it wouldn't have been. I ain't stupid. So it's on. <br/>Yeah, well let me get back there before...  Okay. <br/>We'll deal with that later. My strategy from the beginning was if I found the immunity idol I wouldn't  tell anybody, but I wanted Jaison to trust me, so I showed him I had it and  said, "You see. You can trust me." I don't have plans to give it to him. I just want him to think that I will if he needs it. How does it look on me? How does it look on me? Pretty? Pretty? <br/>Let's go get tree mail. Come on. <br/>Me and you? <br/>Yes. Okay, Mike, don't doubt yourself. We can do this, right? We're not going to give up. <br/>We got to. We got to. Betsy's paranoid. We're the two older ones, but at Tribal Council, I didn't get one vote but I  want to show 'em today that, you know, I'm not the weakest. I'm the oldest, but I am definitely not the weakest. <br/>We have to win challenges, or we ain't good. <br/>Right. But I think that the next challenge we're gonna do is between Betsy and, you  know, Mike. Whoever performs...  Right. <br/>...last, they're out. <br/>Right. It's easy. Next two are easy. <br/>Easy, yup. <br/>The debate about voting people out is between Mike and Betsy, and the more I  thought about it, the more I thought that it would be smarter to vote Mike  off. He can't compete physically, and God forbid, if we lose the next immunity,  Mike's gonna go. <br/>Mailman. Take it, Boss. <br/>Let's see what we got here. "All the bravado and talking smack may cost someone today. "A rumble and a test of skill will send one more away."  Physical. <br/>"Rumble."  Physical. <br/>Rumble! <br/>Yeah, baby! [laughter]  Who's the boss? Who's the boss? <br/>"Come to the challenge painted as a Samoan warrior." Nice! Who can draw? <br/>I can draw. <br/>I can draw. <br/>Ben and I are drawing. Whoo! <br/>Mike's been dying for this since day one. <br/>This is the one where I have to prove myself, show my stuff. I'm a mean motor scooter and a bad go-getter, man, when it comes to  one-on-one stuff. <br/>They fight dirty around here, Mike. But you're from New York, I know. <br/>Someone's getting hurt, and it ain't our team. I'm going to take him downtown to Chinatown, man. I'm waiting for this. I'm waiting for this. Or I'll die trying. Or I'll die trying. Or I'll die trying. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Galu, getting your first look at the new Foa Foa tribe. Marisa voted out at the last Tribal Council. All right, you guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>ALL: Yes. <br/>Probst: First things first. John, I'll take back the John, I'll take back the immunity idol. immunity idol. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. On my "go," three members of each tribe will battle to retrieve three  balls. You'll pass those balls to three other tribemates up on a platform who will  attempt to shoot those balls into the opposing tribe's basket. After every point, we will switch positions. First tribe to score three points wins immunity and reward, and it's a nice  one. Fishing gear. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: If you cannot catch fish with this, go home. In addition, one other twist, which will be revealed after the challenge. Make sense? Galu, you have one extra member. You're sitting somebody out, cannot sit out the same person in back-to-back  challenges. In this challenge, you must sit out a woman. Monica's going to sit this one out. Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize, and we'll minute to  strategize, and we'll get started. get started. All right, first round. In the pit, we have the men. Up on the platform, the women are the shooters. Survivors ready? Go! A bigcollision right off the bat. You've got to get the ball to the people on the platform so they can take a  shot at the goal. <br/>Rebound, rebound! <br/>Probst: Ball control is everything in this game. <br/>Throw it all the way! <br/>Probst: Shambo shoots and misses. Borassi getting in on it, goes after Erik. Russell has Brett tied up. This is gonna be physical. A lot on the line, this challenge. Borassi going after Erik again. Laura goes underhand. It's short, and Russell tied up. Erik collides with Nick. Liz shoots for Foa Foa and scores! [cheering and whooping] Men, you're out, women, you're down. Next threesome, you're up on the platform. Foa Foa leads, one-zip. Playing to three. Survivors ready? Go. It's the women in the middle. Laura and Natalie going at it right away. Jaison tries to pass it. He's long. John with a shot. <br/>You ain't got nothin'! <br/>Probst: John is short. Natalie and Laura with a heavy match going. Watch the choking. No choking. Russell with a shot for Galu. Oh! Shambo! Easy on the face. John with a shot. John shoots and scores for Galu. We are tied, one-one. <br/>It's all right. I know it's hard. <br/>Probst: All right, everybody listen up. I'm just gonna tell you what I'm observing. You're right on that line of getting ugly, right on the line. So there's no more warnings for a head butt, an accidental choke, a slap to  the face. Consider yourself warned that from this point forward, if I see anything  resembling a cheap shot, you're out of the challenge. Everybody good? All right, we have our next round. Three men are on the platform, two men, one woman in the pit. Survivors ready? Go. Oh! Yasmin annihilates Ashley. Russell and Jaison going at it. Ben throws Yasmin into the fence. Erik with a shot. Just misses. Ben takes down John! Russell and Jaison mix it up. Everybody's tied up. Mick with a shot for Foa Foa. Brett with a shot for Galu. A big battle on the ground. Ben! Stop! Ben, out of the challenge! [whooping] First time in the history of Survivor,somebody's been pulled out  of a challenge. Take a spot here. You're done. <br/>You all right, Russ? <br/>Probst: Starting this point over, Foa Foa is now down one person. That means here in the pit, Galu has a huge advantage. Two guys and a girl taking on one guy and a girl. We are still tied, one-one. Survivors ready? Survivors ready? Go! Go! Galu has all three balls. Big opportunity. Jaison cannot get away from Russell. Jaison takes down John. Erik with an underhand. Erik scores for Galu! Galu leads, two-one. Next round. Men, you're in the pit. Women, up on the platform. Foa Foa has to score to stay in this challenge. Galu scores, they win. Survivors ready? Go! [yelling] Oh! Dave and Russell collide in the middle. Borassi and Erik going at it. Liz shoots and misses. Oh! Big bodies colliding. Erik finally gets some payback on Borassi. <br/>Mike, get us the ball! <br/>Probst: Kelly just misses for Galu. Barossi still stunned from that hit by Erik. Laura goes underhand. Laura scores for Galu! [cheering] Three-one-- Galu wins reward and immunity! and immunity! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Ben, how you feeling about being the first person in the history of  this game to ever be thrown out of a challenge? <br/>Outlaw, baby. Whatever. No use crying over spilled milk. I'm out. I'm just gonna let it go. <br/>Probst: All right, Galu, back-to-back immunity wins. Galu, safe from Tribal Council. Huge reward of fishing gear, plus one twist-- this involves your leader. Russell, come on over. All right, as leader, you must now select one person from your tribe to  accompany the other tribe back to camp. They will return back to your camp after sitting in and observing at Tribal  Council. Who you gonna send? <br/>I'm going to send my home girl... Yasmin. <br/>Probst: Yasmin, this is for you. Open in private once you get to Foa Foa's camp. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Join Foa Foa. After this challenge, this should be interesting. Galu, grab your fishing gear, Galu, grab your fishing gear, head on back to  camp. head on back to camp. All right, Foa Foa, I will see you once again at Tribal Council. And, Borassi, I want medical to take a look at you. <br/>You know, during the challenge, Mike took some really hard hits. I mean, you know, he was very out of breath. I don't know, he just did not seem right to me, and that's huge, especially  right now. If we continue losing, we're going to dwindle to nothing, and then we're just  gonna get then we're just gonna get kicked out one by one. kicked out one by one. [beeping]  What's his blood pressure now? <br/>92 on 60. And you want to stand up for me? Okay. How do you feel standing up? <br/>A little woozy. <br/>A little woozy? All right. Hang on. Cameron's there. Cameron's there. If you need to sit down... If you need to sit down...  Just keep that on. <br/>When we were done with the challenge, Mike was having trouble breathing. <br/>Just gonna get you to do some deep breaths. <br/>When medical checked him out, he was suffering from very, very low blood  pressure. <br/>I'm just gonna look at your blood pressure again. <br/>As a physician myself, you always, especially out here, you've got to  consider the worst-case scenario, which, you know, for him is probably a big  heart attack. <br/>Just have a tiny sit-up. If you start feeling woozy at all, I want you to lie straight back down. Cameron, can you...  I can do it on my own. <br/>I can do it on my own. <br/>All right. <br/>All right. All right, we're going to take All right, we're going to take it again. it again. It's 80 on 60. So he's dropped 30 just standing. <br/>Probst: Is this something that a couple of canteens of water back at camp  will remedy? <br/>We've already tried his canteen, and we've waited for the 40 minutes. The fact that he was blue when he came off the game is a bit scary to start  with, and it just shows us that his heart's not coping very well. <br/>Probst: So, Doc, just so we're clear, you are pulling Barossi from the game? <br/>At this point, yes. <br/>Probst: Okay. All right, Foa Foa, come say your good-byes to Mike. <br/>I wanted to go all the way, you know? I'm a little beat up, but... those guys never got me down in the pit. <br/>Your health's worth way more than a million bucks, my friend. <br/>I think I showed that I can be tough when I have to be, no matter what age I  am, you know? <br/>Probst: All right, so, here's what this means. Foa Foa is now down to eight members. You guys are going to head back to camp with Yasmin. You're still visiting. You will still go to Tribal Council tomorrow night. You guys head back to camp. Borassi, you're going to the hospital. <br/>I was privy to the conversation that Mike had with the physician there. And I think she absolutely made the right decision. With Mike gone, Marisa gone, and then a Tribal Council... [sighs] You know,  I'd like to say we can push through this, but it does push through this, but  it does not bode well for us. not bode well for us. <br/>Did Shambo take the fins, too? <br/>I don't know. <br/>Where is she? <br/>I'd love her to come back with fish. Oh, she's way down there. <br/>Shambo insisted that spearfishing was her thing. Awesome. She's bringing back fish for sure. <br/>Coco rico in my belly. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Shambo's been gone a while. I hope that means she got some fish. <br/>This is the first bath I've had in five days, even if it is a swamp. It feels awesome. I didn't catch any fish, but I tried. And there's no visibility in this pond water, so I can't use the mask and the  spear. So I'm going to go Yogi Bear back float around here for a little while. Hi, peeps. <br/>Hey. <br/>Hey. How'd it go? <br/>You guys want the good news or the bad news? <br/>Bad news. <br/>Bad news? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I had no luck in the ocean. I was in the...  You broke the, uh...  I didn't break it. It floated off while I was in the swamp. I wasn't using the mouthpiece. I was using this... the mask. <br/>Okay. <br/>Just floated off. <br/>So the mouthpiece is gone? <br/>It is. <br/>You couldn't find it? <br/>It's in the swamp. There's nothing I can do. <br/>And the good news? <br/>There are hundreds of thousand of fish on the reef, so...  The good news is-- you'll never believe it-- there's fish in the ocean. You know, I feel sorry for her, in one sense, because she's kind of desperate  right now, trying to catch fish, and then on top of not catching the fish,  she loses our stuff. You just signed your own death warrant is basically what you did. <br/>I mean, if everybody would come closer, I'd like to introduce myself. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Tell you guys who I am and find out a little bit about you. Okay, now, my name is Yasmin, and I'm a professional hair stylist. I don't know how you're feeling about me, but let's just say I'm not the  enemy. Not only that; I'm here to help you guys strategize, because to me, I don't  like a not-fair fight. It's almost like, why be matched up with people that's not matched up with  the right people, because then it's like taking candy from a baby. Who the hell wants to do that? That don't boost my self-esteem. You know what I'm saying? That makes me seem like I really did something that was a cakewalk, but, um...   We got Yasmin here, and, uh, what-what are her first words to us? "I want to help you guys. Why? Because I don't want this to be a cakewalk. I don't want this to be like taking candy from a baby." I was, like,  "Screw you."  Now don't get offended, but personally, off the riff, I've noticed that  strategy may be, um, something you guys are lacking, and I don't know his  name. What's his name right there? <br/>Ben. <br/>Ben, I would like to talk to you in private about something. For sure. I know this is not the game that people think you can be honest...  She's full of crap. She comes over here to our camp, disrespects us, calls us babies, tells us  how we can win a challenge if we listen to her. She come to the wrong camp, and she ain't getting nothing but disrespect from  me from now on, and you know what? She's going to pay for that She's going to pay for that statement, I promise  you. statement, I promise you. <br/>"Congratulations. You now have a clue to the hidden immunity idol. It's up to you whether you share this information with anyone else."  [sighs] "Search hard here at Foa Foa. Your treasure's not easy to see. If you don't find it in a little while, you must be barking up the wrong  tree." Hmm. I haven't been here all of two hours yet, so I don't know who I can trust. I do care about getting that idol, but with that clue and all I had to go on  was a tree. You know how many trees are out here? Too many, so you know.... <br/>Sure. <br/>Okay. Now. <br/>What's up? <br/>Let's talk about cheap shots. I don't know...  Trippin' somebody ain't a cheap shot. <br/>Uh, uh, uh, uh. 'Cause guess what? You tackled me like a dude. Don't tell me you don't remember. <br/>Well, that's just the way the game's played. It wasn't anything personal. You were going after one of my teammates...  But you a dude. Look at the match-up. Do you see women playing football with men that play football? <br/>That's because they can't. <br/>It's either all women...  They cannot...  I want to know. They don't for a reason. So I want to know, why would a dude as tall as you tackle me? <br/>'Cause you were going after my teammate. <br/>That was very disrespectful. <br/>Do you underst...  But... I understand what you're saying, but you know what? You're not showing me no sympathy, and you're not understanding what I'm  saying. You're a dude. It doesn't matter. Yes, it is a game. <br/>Listen, Grammar School. Listen, here's where it's... here's where it's going, all right? <br/>Listen, Ignorant, since you want to say Grammar School. <br/>Ignorant? What's the definition of ignorant? <br/>Yeah, yeah. What's the definition of grammar school? I'm just telling you how I feel. But since I see I won't get nowhere with you, I won't waste my energy, but I  wanted to let you know because I don't back down to nobody, and I don't appreciate  you tackling me. <br/>You won't get anywhere with me, not... no way. Yasmin is just a piece of work. Yasmin has a big mouth. Yasmin smells bad. She's got really poor grammar. I think Yasmin is pretty close to being a hooker. <br/>You the one look like a fool. You look like a big jerk going after a girl. Okay, if a dude saw that on TV, they wouldn't say, "Ooh, he tackled a  girl; he's the bomb." They'd be, like, "You know what? He's a big sissy." That's what they would say. <br/>I say, "Kill 'em all." I say, "Kill 'em all."  That's what they would say, but you heard what I said. <br/>Yeah, I heard your incorrect grammar the whole time. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>She was just barking up the wrong tree, 'cause I'm the one person that you  just don't want to approach like that. <br/>And I see, you know what? <br/>You don't even know the definition of ignorant. <br/>You're looking for a fight becauseyou're ignorant. <br/>You don't even know the definition of ignorant. <br/>Who would tackle a girl that weighs 110? <br/>You were going after my teammate, so just shut up. You're in our camp. <br/>Ben is definitely a wild card. He's definitely a liability. He's saying things at challenges. He's getting kicked out of challenges. Um, honestly, I think what Ben's doing is stupid on his part. <br/>She's ghetto trash, plain and simple. <br/>That's right. <br/>She needs to go back to eating ketchup sandwiches and drinking Kool-Aid and  doing whatever the hell she does and leave me alone. <br/>You know what? I wish Yasmin was here for another three days 'cause I love confrontation. 'Cause her and Ben start fighting. Everybody starts hearing it. I love that. That just makes everybody not like Ben. You know, I got some great plans set ahead, and, uh, it's plans set ahead,  and, uh, it's going to be real fun. going to be real fun. going to be real fun. [scraping] [scraping] [scraping]  What do you think? <br/>What do you think? <br/>What do you think? [animal hooting, birds singing] [animal hooting, birds singing]  Um, I don't know what's going on, but Ben was up all night. I think he's asking to be thrown out. It was so ridiculous. It was so crazy. Why would you hammer a machete in the middle of the night? With a fire going. There's no reason. So I don't think anybody's too happy. <br/>I was getting really annoyed by the guy, and it's really starting to drive me  crazy. <br/>You know how he gets, man. Anybody calls him out on anything, or he gets exasperated, he really just  unleashes, instead of just being like, "Hey, man we need to talk like,  "Hey, man we need to talk about this." about this."  Who the hell hammers in the middle of the night? At nothing. <br/>I don't know. <br/>I don't get him. Now that Mike's gone, my head is definitely on the chopping block, 'cause I  know they're all looking at me as being the elder and the weakest. But I don't want to go home at all. I don't want to go home at all. I don't want to go home at all. Ben needs to go, in my opinion. I know that you're saying, "Oh, we need him for strength or to win  challenges," but we haven't won any challenges, and plus, he got kicked  out of a challenge. So, I would have voted for him. Even if it didn't happen last night and all that, I was going to vote for him  anyway. I was going to tell you I was going to vote for him. <br/>Tonight, I think Betsy's going home. We need to focus on challenges, and she is considered to be the weakest link  right now, physically. But, uh, Ben getting kicked out of the challenge, him waking up and chopping  wood, his big altercation with, uh, Yasmin-- I mean, those are three big  strikes, so I don't know if he's got a lot of friends left. <br/>Go with your gut. Go with a woman's intuition. <br/>It's hard. <br/>It's strong, though. Listen to your intuition. To go to a... go with a police woman, motherly type, or an outlaw? <br/>I don't know. There's a lot at stake. <br/>An outlaw who is a pain in the ass! I think if anybody else got kicked out of a challenge-- which has never  happened before-- they would be getting voted off at Tribal Council. Why isn't it not Ben? <br/>Just I don't know. <br/>I won't write your names down. <br/>Maybe Ben would be the right choice to kick out tonight. He's not a nice guy, and he's, you know, kind of pissing people off. I did originally think, you know, I was stuck on voting out Betsy, but now  that I think about it more and more, I don't about it more and more, I don't  know if that's the right choice. know if that's the right choice. <br/>I just don't know if we're making the right choice. <br/>Well, this is... this is my thing. We made a big sacrifice with Marisa and we kept the physical weakness, and we  lost. <br/>Well, and we got a loss because he got thrown out of the challenge yesterday. <br/>Yes, absolutely. <br/>And he's pissing a lot of people off around camp. Yeah, he might be physically a little better, but Betsy's a cop. And you know what, if we...  But she's slow. <br/>There are some good points to voting off Ben eventually, but Betsy is a  47-year-old cop and Ben is a 28-year-old... young guy. They are not physically equivalent, which is the argument that Ashley was  trying to make. And I'm, like, oh, my God. I can't... I don't know what to do with this girl. I think it's more better for you to talk to Ashley. <br/>Well, what is she so concerned about? She's trying to switch up the whole thing. <br/>She's getting worried, and you need to, like, lock and load. <br/>Wow. <br/>I don't know. <br/>Betsy has to go, or we will get our asses kicked. It's over. She's going, for sure. <br/>You and I know that...  You... you... Jaison... She... you know what? She better stop that. <br/>I didn't talk to her. <br/>Betsy's going home tonight because, first of all, she's the weakest link, and  second of all, she doesn't trust me. Marissa threatened me, Betsy threatened me-- I'm gonna go down the line. Each time somebody threatens me, they're going home. Ashley-- she'll be going home next. I want to keep Ben this time, and you know what? Ben's gonna stay this time. 'Cause whatever I want, happens. 'Cause whatever I want, happens. <br/>Probst: Come on in and take a seat. Yasmin, you can have a seat Yasmin, you can have a seat right over here. right over here. All right, last time you were here, the discussion really centered around a  negative force that you identified as Marisa. You voted her out. Liz, one big happy family now? <br/>Uh, I think so, for the most part. It doesn't help that we lost yet another challenge. That never bodes well, but I think going forward, yeah, we are pretty united. <br/>Probst: So if it's one big happy family, Yasmin's visit must have been fairly  pleasant? <br/>Um, there was one minor incident with Yasmin and Ben, but I think for the  most part, her stay was fairly congenial. <br/>Probst: Ben, what happened with Yasmin? <br/>Uh, when Yasmin showed up, she said, "Let's talk about cheap  shots." She goes, "Oh, you tackled me, and I'm a girl." I'm,  like, "There wasn't any rule that a guy couldn't push a girl down."  And she's, like, "Oh, you're a sissy," and, like, starts going on  and on and on. Her grammar is so poor, it was like talking to an idiot. She's ghetto trash, and I have no respect for her and she needs to go back to  where she came from. <br/>Probst: Russell, you're biting your tongue to get in on this. <br/>I have to say, when she came to our house, she said, "It's like taking  candy from a baby." If somebody came to your house and disrespected your  family, are you gonna turn the other cheek and go in the other room, or are  you gonna kick 'em out your house? <br/>Well, I think we can sit here and talk about kicking somebody out of the  house, but we got to win a challenge. Yeah, I was upset that she said "taking candy from a baby," and I  don't want to get punched in the face and left in the mud and then been told  that I'm a baby, no. But, you know, you don't prove it in here, you don't prove it by yelling at  somebody-- you prove it by beating the other team, period. <br/>Probst: Mick, you're the leader. You okay with how Ben handles defending your tribe? <br/>That's how Benny rolls, basically. I mean, the guy doesn't just show teeth, I mean, he bites. <br/>Probst: Can that be disruptive to a tribe? <br/>Well, I think it sort of intimidates people a little bit. But you know what you're gonna get from him, so if you don't want that, like,  don't go there. <br/>I'd just like to say something about Ben. <br/>Probst: Betsy. <br/>With him helping us lose the challenge, him mouthing off, him chopping wood  in the middle of the night, driving everybody crazy, he would probably be the  first person being voted out tonight. And what I don't understand is, I'm the only one that brought my bag. And maybe it's the cop, but we have one of these guys in every town. It's, like, "Did you see that speeder go by? He was going faster than Iwas." You know? It's where they just basically slide by the rules. I mean, if I got kicked out of a challenge yesterday, I could understand, but  I don't understand why my head's on the chopping block and not his. <br/>Probst: Ashley, you think it hurt you guys yesterday losing Ben? <br/>Definitely. I was in there with two guys and a girl, and they'd attack Jaison, so it was  just me. So it did hurt us in the end, which is disappointing, but...  Probst: Ben, any regret at all about what happened at the challenge? <br/>First of all, you never said we were playing by your kind of sissy rules. I mean, I regret that I didn't get to help my teammates, but do I regret  tripping him? Absolutely not. I mean, everybody else is doing all this reallycrazy stuff, and all I did was  trip somebody. <br/>Probst: Accidental trip or on purpose? <br/>Oh, completely on purpose. I was, like, "This guy's big; I can't tackle him. But guess what? My legs are longer than his. Whack! Big tree fall hard." That's basically what happened. <br/>Probst: Ben, say that when this game started you had a 100% chance of winning. Where do you think it's at now? <br/>I got a good as chance as anybody. <br/>Probst: You believe, based on how you've acted, that your chances of winning  are as good as anybody else left in the game? <br/>I definitely do. You know what, I'm straightforward people. And I'm one of those people, I do not start a fight, but if you come at me,  you're gonna get a fight. <br/>Probst: Okay, it is time to get to the vote. That means, Yasmin, your time here is done. You've had a chance to observe a lot. What you choose to share and what you choose to keep to yourself is up to you. Grab your stuff, head back to Grab your stuff, head back to camp. camp. All right, it is time to vote. All right, it is time to vote. Mick, you're up.

Stay tuned for scenes from our Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor... Russell's mind games continue. <br/>You plant that seed in their head, and it's called a "Russell  seed." It takes over their whole mind. <br/>Probst: Jaison recruits an army to fight him. <br/>I'm definitely loyal to Jaison. <br/>Probst: And Shambo is on the outs. <br/>Are you frickin' kidding me? You know, we got four people You know, we got four people doing yoga. doing yoga. <br/>Well, it took me six years to get here. I loved every minute of it. The only thing I'm not gonna miss is Ben and his attitude. He needs to grow up. He's still not admitting that he did something wrong at the challenge. It's all gonna blow up in their face. They made the wrong choice tonight. I just hope they kind of see that. If they don't open up their eyes, the whole tribe will go eyes, the whole  tribe will go down, I bet.
