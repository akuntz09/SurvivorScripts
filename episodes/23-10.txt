<br/>Previously on "Survivor."  jeff: Immunity team for 19 daystwo sides Upolu and Savaii traded victories in  one of the closest battles ever when they merged it was still. It's six on six. Everybody is looking for an in. Jeff: But after the firsttribal council Cochran betrayed his own tribe giving  old Upolu a numbers advantage. He threw the whole tribe under the bus. You disgust me. Jeff: Jim, facing tonight'stribal council -- when ozzie failed to win  immunity they jumped to vote him out. Ozzie once again. Jeff: Sending him toRedemption Island. I'm going to treat them really nice then send them packing. Jeff: At the next immunity challenge Whitney from the old Savaii hung on for  the win. She's safe at tonight's tribal council. Jeff: Back at camp ater previously going against his alliance and targeting Edna  Albert again tried to take control by targeting john. I'm thinking he's going. Albert is getting nervous. He's thinking a lot right now. But in tribal council Albert's plan was rejected by Coach and the old Upolu  tribe. Jim, tribe has spoken. Jim was sent to Redemption Island. Now with seven remaining in the Upolu alliance the question is, will anyone  seize the opportunity to team up with Dawn and Whitney and turn the game  upside down. Upside down. Whitney won immune tie today. They all sat out. All seven sat out. And they gave the whole -- with honor and like getting. The longer that Coach has them believing that they're all one tribe more  likely it is that he wins a million dollars. Going to bring him to the end. Pisses me off. I hate to say I told you so. I won't say it. I. Jim is the most dangerous kind of person because to your face and on the  surface he looks like the best friend of everybody. When the chips are down he wouldn't do it -- that's the worst kind of guy. Now that he's gone we're going to grow as a family even more so. You guys don't have anything to worry about. Trust me. Survival 101, rule 37, anybody that is on the bottom of the alliance better  not feel like they're on the bottom or they're going to revolve and scramble  to find a bet are place. I keep talking to people about unity and respect. Because people get scared in this game. Blind sides happen every day, in fact more blind sides happen than alliances  sticking together. You guys have been around me. I don't dictate anything. I never tell these guys who to do. We all make suggestions, it's equal. Coach is running the show like he's Jesus. All of them think that they're going to go to the end, obviously seven can't  go to the end. It's so frustrating I kind of want to laugh at him be like, y'all are so  smart, Cochran went to harvard. Sophie is going to med school. I don't understand how these smart people can be so stupid. Captioning brought to you by Survivor productions, cbs, âªâª âªâª 45 degree angle. Step out. And push that target out. Come back like you're shooting a bow. People it as you pull back then we'll come out of it. You can come out of it any way you want to. Come back to the center. Bring your hands together. As painful as it is to admit it, I am drinking the Coach's kool-aid, not in  huge gulps but taking ginger steps. I'm going to meet my untimely death, I got to obey the father of the family. I got to tell you, man, I’m a little bit worried. I'm a little bit worried. About what? I don't know. I'm just worried, man. Albert's been really squirrely the last couple of days. Brandon's running around in Brandon mode. Sometimes think I’m going to get blindsided. Do you think everybody else is going to vote? I will do everything in my power to make sure that doesn't happen. But everybody always says that I’m in control of the game, I’m really not. I think you're worried that Albert is going to do something. I just think that fishy things are abroad. Kind of alarming to hear that Coach is concerned about Albert in the game  right now. Some sort of power struggle, Albert he's possibly one of the two biggest  leaders of that group so it's possible he's aware that they are gunning for  him earlier than they say they are. So I’m starting to get concerned about my place. I felt comfortable 24 hours ago, today I’m not so comfortable. Jeff: Now bring in the competitors for today's dual. Keith, ozzie and Jim voted out the last tribal council. Brought the whole tribe here to witness today's dual. Here is how it works. With your arms outstretched you will use the top of your hand toehold two  poles against an overhead board. If you lower your hands even slightly the poles will drop, you're out of the  duel. Last person left standing stays alive in this duel with a shot at a million  dollars. The two losers are out for good and will become the first and second members  of our jury. Oh, wow. Jeff: Big stakes.this is it. One shot, take your spot. All right. Everybody is in position. This duel is on. This is another duel where you need to concentrate. Because if you lower your hands even just a little bit, that's all that pole  needs to fall to the side. First person out becomes the first member of the jury. Second person out becomes second member of the jury. Last person standing is still in the hunt for a million dollars. Huge stakes at this duel. Huge stakes at this duel. Jeff: Who are you rooting forBrandon? I'd look to root for Jim. Jeff: Anybody here rootingfor Keith? Yes. Go Keith. Jeff: How about for Ozzy?Ozzy is on his own. Jeff: How about for Ozzy?Ozzy is on his own. Jim drops out of the duel. Jim becomes the first member of our jury. We're down to Ozzy and Keith. They were tribe mates at one point now they're battling against each other,  one stays alive. One joins the jury. Keith getting close to that edge. Ozzy with a bit of movement. Stay focused. If you want to win this game you have to win this duel. That is it. It couldn't be any more clear. Both guys with their poles on the edge of their boards. Ozzy flirting with disaster trying to keep his pole on the board. Tiniest little movement those poles are going to drop. Keith drops out of the challenge. Keith becomes the second member of our jury. Ozzy stays alive in this game. And remains a threat to get back in. Ozzy, the one guy who had no support from the tribe. I'm sitting in the best place I think that I could. How so? I don't have to rely on people's trust I’m sitting there at redemption eating  my heart out, getting ready for the next person to come in. I'll be nice, i'll make fish, make you fruit. Then come in i'll beat you, i'll be sitting at the end, too, see who is back  stabbed who and who is taken the higher road, if you will. Huge fan of "Survivor ." big fan. Jeff: Wanted to be part ofthis experience for a long time. I'm hoping there's a secret double Redemption Island. Not going to happen. Jeff: There is no double Redemption Island. You'll become first member of our jury time for you to go. [ applause ] this adventure is over, you'll become the second member of our  jury. Time for you to go. Good job, Keith. Good pluck. Ozzy, stay alive on Redemption Island grab your stuff, head back, await your  next duel. See you later guys. Head back to camp. I got to say being alone on redemption is a beautiful thing. I've really scored out here. Like my mini paradise. I've got all that I could ever want in food. One of the most beautiful reefs full of cavs. I'm really glad that Te Tuna tribe is missing my skills. As far as I can tell nobody is able to get out there and go fishing. Because they got to spend a lot of their energy watching out, who is doing  what and where people are going and who people are talking to. They got to watch out for the could notifying nature that is the normal  classic end game of "Survivor". Redemption adds a whole new twist. You have the skills and ability like I do, you can come out here and really  refresh, rejuvenate get everything set to go and play the end game with a  passion and a ferocity that you can't get when you're having to deal with a  tribe. I think it's that duel proves that I’m a huge physical threat still. And if anything i've just gotten stronger since being out here on redemption. And the next couple people coming through redemption are going to have a big  challenge in front of them. And that's me. Nothing, huh? I jeopardized my own game and didn't out your game plan. When our group could have shook it up. I feel like you could reciprocate. I'll do anything to stay in now. You're still the number one person on the list. There's something appealing about the idea of returning to Dawn and Whitney. They know it's going to basically have to be the act of an angel looking over  them to carry them further. I think if I were that angel that would probably earn me a lot more jury  votes than just blindly following the Upolu. I'm willing to change -- yeah. I get it. Either way it's going to be a leap of faith. I'm going to have to trust that the few promises I have received to take me  further than 7th place have been sincere or if I really am 7th in line I got  make a big move. This is something I need to seriously consider. Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right guys ready to get to your immune fecal then first things first, Whitney,  I have to take it back. Not going to help me at all, are you? Nope. I don't want to let go of it. Jeff: Once again immunity, back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will balance a bowl filled with rice on top of  your head. On my go you will race across two teeter-totters and empty your rice in to a  container. If at any point you touch the bowl while on top of your head or the bowl  falls off you got to go back to the start. First person to finish wins immunity. Is safe from the vote and is one step closer to the money. All right, we'll draw for spots, we'll get started. All right, everybody. Put your bowls on top of your head. Find a good sweet spot, get that beanbag on there, make sure that bowl feels  comfortable. All right, here we go for immunity. Survivors ready. Go! Making sure you get a good fit on your head is key. Albert back to the start. Coach has to head back. Cochran's got to head back. Lot of balance in this. Use your body. Rick hanging on there. He's got to go back. Dawn off to a good start. Dawn almost loses it, nice recovery. Brandon and Sophie trying to win this. Dawn is back. She emptied her rice. Brandon's back with his rice. Sophie back with her rice. We got a challenge now. Coach giving it another shot. Coach got something going now. Whitney up and over that first teeter totter heading out on the second. Once you find that sweet spot this gets easier. Got to head back. Coach with his bowl of rice. Whitney, close, Whitney falls. Brandon and Edna doing great. Edna almost. Falls out, Edna has to head back. Brandon with his second bowl of rice. Dawn not messing around, she knows she needs immunity tonight. Dawn with another bowl of rice. Sophie with another bowl of rice. Brandon, Dawn and Sophie fighting for immunity. Everybody else struggling. It has come down to a three-person challenge right now. It is Dawn, Brandon and Sophie. Sophie now with a huge move, a very full bowl of rice. It is overflowing. Sophie has more ricin her bowl than anybody else has taken at one time. That thing is filled to the brim. That could be enough. Brandon with another bowl of rice. Will that do it? No. Dawn with another bowl of rice. She's close. Sophie, will it be enough rice? Sophie with that wins immunity! Wow! Sophie, come on over. [ applause ] good job, Sophie. So proud of you. Nice job. Jeff: Sophie is safe at tonight's tribal council. One step closer to getting to the end. All right, guys, tonight a twist of tribal council which will be revealed at  tribal. Head back to camp. Whitney and I are on the out. We had to win the challenge for sure. But I haven't lost hope. Jeff said tribal council there will be a twist. So I think if this isn't the time to get up because anything can happen. Good job, guys. I was disappointed with my performance in today's immunity challenge, I thought  there was a chance I would excel. Again my lack of balance and agility came back to haunt me. It was definitely Dawn and Whitney. Thing is that if Dawn gets to the end of this game she'll win. No question. That's why we want to get her off sooner than later. Luckily Dawn and Whitney are in such a bad position right now. They know they're the next two to go. Unfortunately when jeff mentioned there would be a twist at tonal's tribal  council my first thought, double elimination. There's always the possibility that after we vote out one of the two there  will be another immunity challenge if one of the remanning two wins that  challenge, I could be in danger. So I’m a little bit nervous. We needed to win that. So mad at myself. I think it's going to be me. I had to win the challenge today, there wasn't any way around it. I'm most likely going to Redemption Island tonight. They are so issue about the -- Coach has this loyal following. But it's not over. I mean the one thing about this game is you can lay in bed and think, I’m  going home. And whole day changes. That's our only hope. Right now we'd be up for making a move. Just picking the right people, Brandon is such a loose cannon that you don't  know what to believe. Rick, he's not even playing the game. Edna, she's so far up Coach's butt it's ridiculous. Albert at least seems like a good guy. We're two votes that can help someone. I don't know who it is. We have no alliance to anyone. Right now I’m at a crossroads. I feel like my only real chance to win this game is to secure every Savaii  vote. I have possibly getting Edna immediately for couple of reasons. A, I really want to credit Cochran for what he's done for us by moving him up  the ladder, so to speak. Also want to curry a little bit of extra favor with a Whitney or Dawn. Now i've buttered three potential jury members and lost an Edna who wasn't  going to vote for me anyway. Like Edna has not done a thing. Basically just been following coat tails and follows him around. Like to me that's bogus, because I hopsly truly legitimately feel that you  guys deserve it more. Cochran and myself plus you and Dawn and one more person that would be five. And vote Edna. Thank you. I am in with that. I'm on board. A bizarre thing not to talk to these people. Not to be rude but when times come to vote someone out you can't sit there  make yourself available. Available. I didn't see that. I'm screwed. Big time. Albert just confirmed my suspicion, is that I’m going to be voted out. Not exactly shocked but I felt complete betrayal of our trust because I saved  that entire tribe. If they think that Edna is a more valuable player for them somebody who made  more sacrifices for them they're sorely mistaken. I came to play "Survivor" it's about big moves. I didn't make the big jump I did to be voted out. I wanted to move further in this game. If that means slipping back again then something I have to consider. How are we doing? Doing good. I just want to tell what you the deal s. Whitney and Dawn are obviously dead people walking. But here's the thing. Who is Edna going to have the most allegiance to as a jury member? Coach. We're never getting her vote. It's pretty obvious. Why don't we take this opportunity to make good of what some people like a Dawn  and Whitney who could end up being votes for us at the end. I'm going to put the cards on the table f. We don't rid of Edna now. Albert is showing his true colors more and more which are same three my true  colors. This is our one shot to make the big moves. Because you have two, three votes hanging around. I've given no promises to Edna. They annoy the hell out of me. She wrings it to the table. Not out organize, out clean, out gather. It's fRickin' Survivor. Albert is trying to take control of this game and I’m the swing vote. So now I’m debating whether to stick with Coach or go with Albert's crazy  plan. In the end of the day it's a question of what will take me to the end. I think Coach is getting suspicious. That worries me. Albert right now is playing for Albert that's a dangerous game to play. See him talking to Whitney, Dawn, either trying to come up with a plan or  trying to curry jury votes. Neither one is acceptable in my opinion. If anybody wants to go over five it's instant death. There are three types of motivational style, there is coddling, reaffirming  and fear. So I feel at the moment like an old mob boss. If anybody goes against the family, they're dead. Jeff: We'll now bring in our members of the jury. Jim and Keith. So Dawn, once the immunity challenge was over you knew you didn't have  immunity your job became, find a crack or create a crack in this alliance of  seven. Tell me how the afternoon went? I think it's time for them to use the two of us. It's hard, people that I see in five, six and seven position seem content to  stay with the group at five, six and seven. Jeff: Your pitch is, five, six and seven come with Whitney and me and we've  got five. Right. Jeff: We've we're now the final five. Right. Jeff: Whitney, who have you heard is five, six and seven? Cochran is seven that's all I know. Jeff: You feel confident about that? I do. Jeff: Based on what? Just observation and just hearing some things. Jeff: How does that make you feel? Not the first time this topic has come up. I'm aware I’m in position where I’m a late comer to the Upolu group be  tempting to automatically make me seven because of that. I'm confident that if I do reach that position i'll be able to do some  maneuvering. Jeff: You're telling me as an avid fan of this game you have not started  thinking beyond seven? You're there. This is happening. There are seven and there are two. Tonight I’m guessing it's Dawn or Whitney where there's a crack and somebody  is about to get blindsided. If not you're going to be very, very late to a party that not going to be  interested in letting you in the door. I am planning ahead. I'm speaking in the future tense I’m already making plans what I would like  to have happen. There are fractures. Jeff: Let me put it to you different. True or false, this is great time for somebody to make a big move. This is the ideal time to make a big move. There for people that they know they're in a desperate situation, they're  probably willing to devote their entire loyalty to whoever is willing to  bring them a little bit further in the game. But this is time to make a big, big move. As a Survivor man I like big moves. Jeff: Dawn, what is your best move? My best move right now to say, i've got nothing but loyalty. I feel like i've been hard competitor in the game I feel like my word has  been kept. And in the people that i've spoke to today, you know that I absolutely would  stand behind you. Jeff: Coach, how concerning is this to you that one person changes their mind  and starts a shift and a big move happens and suddenly this game which is in  such control right now starts to slip away. You know, it's always a concern. I'm always thinking about it. Sometimes I sit and I watch people go off in to groups, we have thinkers on  this tribe. What happens if. So can these two garner two or three votes and change the entire game. Absolutely. I don't do a lot of talking contrary to popular believe I’m not running this  this alliance or running the show but I’m always thinking in the back of my  head that people have to make big moves in order to get further in this game. So I worry, I stress, I believe, I trust, all of those emotions all day long. It drives me crazy. Jeff: Whitney. When Coach said contrary to popular bee leave I’m not the leader of this  tribe you kind of smiled and rolled your eyes. Did i? Well, I just see a lot of -- just observing things like everybody always  reports back to Coach. Seems like maybe that would be the position he's in there. If they're always reporting back that's what you got to assume, right? Jeff: Does that surprise that you she observed that everybody goes back to Coach. No, doesn't surprise me at all. It's been widely interpreted that Coach is leader by a lot of the members --  jeff: Is he your leader? I don't think he is my leader or this leader of this group or alliance might  just be a figurehead who represents lead are ship to the group or might be  pulling the real strings. It's very easy to make that natural connection from Coach to leader. Jeff: Coach -- I don't feel like I’m a leader but obviously I like to hear  information. Knicks is the biggest power in this game. When people give me information I take it, I file it away. I use it one day when I think that my life is in jeopardy out here, which  that day is coming, fairly soon, yes. Jeff: All right. It is time to get to the vote. Dawn and Whitney clearly you two are on the bubble unless somebody in this  group of seven decides tonight is the night to make a big move. Sophie has immunity. Everybody is fair game. Brandon, you're up. Brandon, you're up. Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has hidden immunity you want to play it now would be the time to  do so. Once the votes are read the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediate  leech i'll read the votes. First vote, Dawn. Edna. Dawn, two votes for Dawn. Edna, we're tied. Two votes Dawn, two votes Edna. Dawn. Three votes Dawn. That's four votes Dawn two, votes Edna. 11th person voted out of Survivor: South park. Dawn. Bring me your torch. Dawn, the tribe has spoken. You will have done that get back in this game. Grab your torch at Redemption Island, good luck. Okay, now the twist I told you about earlier. We're going to go right in to another immunity challenge with a vote to  follow. Jeff: Okay. We're going to go right in to another immunity challenge. Sophie, take that immunity necklace. For grabs. I'm now going to ask you series of survival related questions. After 27 days out here this is stuff you should know. Answer correctly you stay alive. You get it wrong, you're out of the challenge. Grab the cube behind you. All right, shall we begin? First question, to prevent dehydration it's recommended that Survivors drink  how much purified water every day? A, one pint. B, one quart. C, one dpal lone. Once you have it hold it in front of you. Okay. Correct answer is, c, one gallon. Whitney got it right. Cochran got it right. Coach got it right. Brandon got it right. Sophie got it right. Albert, you're wrong. Edna, you're wrong, Rick, you're wrong. Set your cubes down you're out of this challenge. Just like that we are down to five. Next question. True or false: The coconut crab gets its name because it's favorite food is  coconut. Correct answer is true. Whitney stays alive. Coach stays alive. Sophie stays alive. Cochran, Brandon, you're out of the challenge. We are down to three. Whitney, Coach and Sophie. The soft edible flesh found inside the shell of a fallen coconut is called,  a, pacific artichoke. B, heart of palm. C, palm fingers: Or d, cocoa sprouts. Whitney and Sophie both say heart of palm. Coach says cocoa sprout. Coach, I don't know what a cocoa sprout is but it's incorrect. Coach is out of the challenge. Whitney and Sophie are both right. It is heart of palm. We're now down to Whitney and Sophie. Interesting situation, isn't it? The one person clearly in trouble tonight is Whitney. She's one of the two people left in this challenge. True or false: Although they are quite delicious, you should not attempt to  remove giant South Pacific clams from the ocean as they are considered  dangerous. True or false. True or false. This will decide it right here. Whitney says it is true. You should not attempt to remove them because they are dangerous. Sophie says, that is false. Correct answer... False. They are not dangerous at all. Sophie wins another immunity. Whitney, so close. Sophie come on over. Sophie once again you are safe from the vote. Cannot vote for Sophie. Everybody sells fair game. Sophie, if you'll take this back and vote first. And vote first. I'll go tally the votes. Okay, once the votes are read the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Cochran. Whitney. Two votes Whitney. Three votes Whitney. Whitney, that's four votes Whitney. One vote Cochran. 12th person voted out of "Survivor: Southable pacific" bring me  your torch. Whitney, tribe has spoken. You will have a chance to get back in this game. Good luck. The good news is the seven of you have accomplished your goal. Bad news, no where left to hide. This game is about to change. Grab your torches head back to camp. Good night.
