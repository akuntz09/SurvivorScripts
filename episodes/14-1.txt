<br/>Jeff Probst: We are flying over the stunning water of the Fiji Islands, a  place once known for its cannibalism, uncharted reefs, and formidable  warriors. These islands are home to spectacular sea life and lush, spectacular sea life  and lush, jagged terrain. jagged terrain. Just below are 19 strangers that represent an extreme cross-section of  America, from a former homeless street performer to a Harvard-educated lawyer. They have been given absolutely no information. The fear of the unknown is so strong that one survivor quit just moments  before being set adrift miles from shore. Exile Island is back, with hundreds of deadly sea snakes. And this time, two hidden immunity idols will complicate the game like never  before. 39 days, 19 people, one 39 days, 19 people, one survivor. survivor. <br/>When I got there, I noticed we were, like, all 19 of us together. I thought that Jeff was going to be there and we were going to be, like,  split into tribes, and "You go this way and you go the other way."  other way." But it wasn't the case. But it wasn't the case. <br/>In my past, where I used to work and stuff, they called me Stallone. They called me... I guess I look like Sylvester Stallone or Rocky. I have droopy eyes, dark hair. For some reason James was too hard for them to remember, so hard for them to  remember, so Rocky will suffice. Rocky will suffice. <br/>We were just so excited to get here, it didn't matter what we were doing. We were lost on a deserted island, you know? What would anybody do? Go explore. <br/>Oh, it's water! <br/>Yeah, water! <br/>Water! <br/>Where? <br/>Filled my canteen. I'll tell you right now, I lost my mind. I didn't know what to do, I didn't know what to say. I was running around like a I was running around like a chicken with my head  cut off. chicken with my head cut off. <br/>We look, and there's this big, beautiful cave. We're like, "This is a blessing. We're like, "We're great."  I found a lemon tree. <br/>We've got banana trees over there. We've got papaya over there. We've got papaya over there. We are stoked. We are stoked. <br/>Well, my real name is Andre. But on this beach I go by But on this beach I go by Dreamz. Dreamz. I came up with the name Dreamz a long time ago. It was more of a name of striving and achievement. <br/>I'm glad we came up here. Now, look at this. It's like buying a new house. You know, you want to see everything-- the backyard, the front yard, living  room, the dining room. You want to see everything that's in your house. And this is our house. I'm the king of Fiji, of an I'm the king of Fiji, of an unnamed island. unnamed island. <br/>My outdoor experience up to this point consisted of being maybe 20 to 40 feet  off the road. This is totally new for me-- sleeping outdoors, finding food. I love coconut, but it's granulated, already shredded in the grocery store. the grocery store. So... So...  It is, I see. <br/>But believe me, it's worth it. <br/>Oh, okay. <br/>Oh, okay. <br/>Okay? <br/>Okay? <br/>Wow! So you're a native, huh? <br/>I'm native, almost. I am definitely trying to prove myself. I can see that all the other guys are quite young, like half my age. Old people are usually the first ones to get booted off, so I'm hoping I will  be the exception here because I know the surroundings, and I can help get  them coconut to drink. <br/>Did you just open that? Oh, thanks! <br/>So what are you thinking right now? <br/>Man, I don't know. Too many people in one place right now. That's what makes me a little bit nervous. <br/>Yeah. <br/>What do you think? <br/>I mean, there's 19 of us. So how do you split that up into two tribes? <br/>We're like, you know, looking around the island for a machete. We're looking for, like, flags for our tribe. We don't have a pot, we don't have water, we don't have anything. We don't even know our tribe name, you know? It's incredibly overwhelming, because there are so many people and none of us  have a clue what's going on. We're looking for Jeff Probst. We're looking for Jeff Probst. We're like, "Where's Jeff?" We're like, "Where's Jeff?"  We're like, "Where's Jeff?"  Come on, we've got visitors! <br/>Come on, we've got visitors! <br/>Come on, we've got visitors! <br/>Bring it in! <br/>Bring it in! <br/>Where's the box? <br/>I think they got it. <br/>Oh, they got it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>We have a box! <br/>Our heroes! <br/>It's got a genie in it! <br/>Everybody was excited. Maybe we can get a machete. Maybe we can get fire. Everybody was anticipating what they wanted to be in that box. <br/>Wait, that can't be the way  Wait, that can't be the way into the box. into the box. <br/>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! <br/>Whoa! <br/>Whoa! <br/>The strongest guys start, like, throwing that thing down, hammering it,  punching it. And here comes the little scrawny guy, Yau-Man. And he opens the whole thing like, you know, in ten seconds. <br/>It takes a real man to do it. <br/>Very simple physics. The weakest point is to drop it on its corner. So I dropped it on its corner So I dropped it on its corner twice, and the  box opened up. twice, and the box opened up. <br/>Listen up. This is very important. <br/>"Welcome survivors. Before you do anything else, you must find the hidden cache of lumber and  supplies. Its location is shown on the map."  Tree mail, right here. <br/>"Use the supplies to construct the best possible living area you can  using the blueprints provided as your guide."  We've got a toilet seat on there. <br/>What? <br/>Toilet assembly. <br/>"Included with this note is a flint to start fire. Make sure you boil your water before drinking. before drinking. Do not waste any time." Do not waste any time."  Let's rock 'n' roll. <br/>You know, we've got this map and directions and instructions that says, you  know, we have to build a shelter, kitchen, and a build a shelter, kitchen,  and a toilet and a picnic table. toilet and a picnic table. <br/>Initially, naively, I thought, "Wow, this is awesome." And then I  thought, "Wait a minute, this is Survivor. This is going to mean something very cruel is going to happen very  soon." very soon."  Let's go do it. <br/>Let's go do it. <br/>Excuse me, brother. <br/>Okay. Here's the fork. Go straight this way. <br/>It's got to be right there. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think I found it. <br/>Holy cow! <br/>All right, all right! <br/>Ah! <br/>What we found at the top of the hill was just all kinds of lumber. And it was, like, shingles for the roof of the shelter. There was all these crazy things that no one in their right minds would ever  imagine that we were going to get when we got here. <br/>Look at all the tools! <br/>Nails, hammers! <br/>We got a bag of rice the first day we were here. brother. You know, maybe a machete and bucket to boil water-- that's what anybody was  expecting. No way... we have a toilet seat. I'll say it again, a toilet seat. <br/>Okay, you, you, and you carry all that stuff down. <br/>One on each shoulder. <br/>Give me that toilet seat. I've never seen where people that come on Survivorhave this much, so I'm  really nervous, because I think a curve ball is coming. It's too easy. <br/>The kitchen's going to be right there, okay? The outhouse will be over there. There was a site plan, and being an architect, of course, I was given all of  the maps and said, "Here, you figure out what to do." So I looked  at the site plan and realized the cave was, in fact, the location of the  shelter. Then there would be a kitchen and an outhouse, and it was... it's a pretty  amazing set of drawings. So we're building. Who's got the site plan? <br/>There's our shovels, all right? <br/>We need the shovel brigade to start shoveling four holes. That's our number one thing. Who's got the shovel? Who's got the site plan? Who's got the tape measure? We need a crew for the kitchen, or else it won't be done until tomorrow. <br/>I do get the sense that Sylvia's trying to dominate. You know, we're all here to do this together, and you're going to upset the  wagon by doing to upset the wagon by doing that. that. <br/>He's what? All right, here's what's going to happen-- whenever there is a big word in a  sentence, we're all going to have a time-out and teach James the big word,  the teach James the big word, the definition. definition. <br/>There's another big word James... orthagonal, huh? Learn something new every day, right? [ cheers]  All right! <br/>Proud of you! <br/>When we started construction, everybody was, like, trying to, like, you know,  prove to other people that they can handle the workload. But as, you know, the workload started going on and on, and the people  started going out in couples, you could see that some couples, you could see  that some people were talking. people were talking. <br/>I'm trying to talk to people and see what's going on so I can... you know, so  I can get my place here. <br/>Okay. <br/>So right now, just me, you. <br/>We need a guy. <br/>We do need a guy. <br/>Who? <br/>I don't know. Me and Jessica have kind of got... you know, we're talking, getting some  stuff... getting some stuff together. We don't really know what's going to happen, so I think I need to be talking  to as many people as I can. <br/>No, y'all are just being silly. This water its too hot to drink. <br/>Just drink it, man. <br/>It just burned me. I ain't going to drink it. It burned me. <br/>So you guys want to... when you're done with the water, do you want to help  with the bathroom, or do you want to start with the kitchen? I feel like it's not moving nearly as fast as it should, because we're still  working on the primary shelter when the kitchens and bathroom still need to  be built. We've got to get everything done okay? So put down...  We need to get this done, because we're running out of light. light. And we have to have this done. And we have to have this done. <br/>The night was rough. There we are with the shelter half done, no roof, half a floor, and we ended  up getting soaked. So today we need to finish our shelter. <br/>Can you, you know, lead a bunch of people to bring all the bunch of people to  bring all the material down? material down? <br/>It should be a two-by-four. <br/>Two-by-four? Well.... <br/>This is a cup. Hold on to it. This is the funnel. <br/>Yau-Man, he's a keeper. He figures out every little thing that goes on. <br/>Drink in good health. <br/>Good hot tea. <br/>Good hot tea. <br/>Lemon. <br/>Lemon. <br/>We're getting together. All 19 of us are bonding. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing, but it's bonding us. Oh, my god! That looks beautiful! <br/>We're rockin'. I'm taking this one home. We've been here almost two days trying to figure out what's going on. I think we just keep getting to know each other until we get to the point  where we get the next the point where we get the next set of instructions. set of instructions. <br/>We have a shelter. It has a floor and a roof. We're going to have a kitchen. We have an outhouse with an actual toilet. It's really surprising to have It's really surprising to have so much on day  two. so much on day two. <br/>We're feeling pretty lucky right now. I mean, this is my Fiji vacation right now. I mean, we have everything that we need. I'm scared about what's coming. <br/>All of your hard work to make this place kind of a home for now! <br/>Nice! <br/>[ applause]  Everybody! Everybody! <br/>I can't take all the credit. Okay, I can. But I just want to thank all my people for getting me coconuts while I was  working. Back as a child, I was pretty much homeless. By the age of seven, I was out of a house and just stayed in the back of a  soup kitchen. And then go into the trash cans and get the food. And it... I mean, it was kind of like what's going on right now. The only thing you have to worry about is when it rains or when you can't  find no more food. I love it. I wish I could bring my family I wish I could bring my family from home here. from home here. <br/>What kind of name is Earl? <br/>Dreamz? <br/>What kind of name is Dreamz? <br/>Who said that? Who said that? Back there. Is that a Chinese person that said that? My thing is to be playful and play too much, just to make sure they notice  that I'm present, to know that my presence is there. Were you as great as I, you Were you as great as I, you could say what you  want to say. could say what you want to say. could say what you want to say. <br/>You know what? <br/>You know what? <br/>Is he going to be quiet at all tonight? <br/>Dreamz kind of came out of nowhere, like, late, while we were all trying to  sleep. He was going off on little rants, like, every 15 to 20 minutes. <br/>Where all the white people here? If you're white, raise your hand. hand. Rock, what color are you, man? Rock, what color are you, man? <br/>I'm Italian, Irish, and Spanish. <br/>You're talking to him or are you going to talk to me? <br/>Just yelling about nonsense. And I'm exhausted. I don't know if the island is getting to him, but he's just getting a little  irritating. Why don't you give me two seconds to talk, and then you can speak and we'll  be done. <br/>Go ahead, talk. <br/>All right, you get a little crazy sometimes. <br/>Just talk. <br/>I'm talking right now. I'm talking to you right now. You get a little jumpy with your voice. You snap, you snap... I don't care what you do with anybody else, you snap a  little bit at me. All right, I'm telling you right now, I don't want to be treated like that. Okay? I'm just trying to go to sleep. I've been running around all day. I don't need you to raise your voice to me. Because I'm not a little girl. <br/>I don't yell at people. That's not me. <br/>What are you doing now? <br/>I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you. I haven't yelled at anybody here. <br/>You're crazy, dude. <br/>And I'm not going to let anybody belittle me. <br/>What do I stand to gain by belittling you? What do I stand to gain? <br/>I don't know. Why? <br/>Because you yelled at me! That's why, that's why! <br/>You are yelling right now. <br/>Because you don't pay attention. I'm trying to explain it to you. <br/>No, you yelled. <br/>Go back to bed. Go back to bed and hang out with your friends. <br/>Whatever, Rock. <br/>I'm pretty hard on myself when it comes to, like, letting my emotions show. I hate to do it. I used to do it when I was young, and I think I'm past that now. But it's just really hard, especially under the conditions we're under right  now. we're under right now. What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do? <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Welcome to Survivor: Fiji. Jessica, tell me about the first few moments. You hit the beach. What happens? <br/>It was wild. It was like a big beach party. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man, I dropped a package out of the sky. Tell me about the reaction. <br/>Someone found the canister and decided to open it and saw the plans. And it's not just any shelter. It looks like a very fancy shelter. And we're supposed to build it. <br/>Probst: Alex, when you started to assemble the shelter, did anybody emerge as  the driving force on how to approach this? <br/>I think initially we were all pretty confused, but luckily, we have an  architect on board. So...  Who's the architect? <br/>Sylvia. <br/>Sylvia right here. <br/>So, I mean, having an architect on here was extremely helpful. <br/>Probst: So the first big task is to build the shelter. And Sylvia, this is what you do every day. <br/>I was so happy. I couldn't believe it. <br/>Probst: So it sounds like, Sylvia, you really stepped up to be the leader. Does that ring true to everybody here? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Nobody disagrees with that? <br/>Nope. <br/>Nope. <br/>Probst: Sylvia, come on over. <br/>Probst: Sylvia, come on over. You are now going to divide You are now going to divide these 18 people into  two tribes. these 18 people into two tribes. You're going to alternate, one person to the green line, one person to the  orange line. Make your first choice, Sylvia. <br/>Cassandra to the green line. <br/>Probst: Cassandra, first member of the unnamed green tribe. Next choice, somebody going to the orange line. <br/>Yeah, Michelle. <br/>Probst: Michelle. Next choice? <br/>Liliana. <br/>Probst: Liliana joins Cassandra. Has the green top to match the green tribe. Next choice. <br/>Erica. <br/>Probst: Erica joins Michelle. Make your next choice. <br/>Stacy, on the green. <br/>Probst: Stacy joins the green tribe.

Make your next choice. <br/>Anthony. <br/>Probst: Anthony joins the orange tribe. Sylvia. <br/>Big Ed to the green. <br/>Probst: Edgardo goes to the green tribe. Mookie goes to the orange tribe. We have our two tribes. Moto. You are green. Ravu, you are orange. Put on your buffs. <br/>Whoo-hoo-hoo! <br/>Probst: Okay, Sylvia, here's what's going to happen. You are not on a tribe. You are still in the game. You're going to Exile Island. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Bad news, you will have company. Thousands of sea snakes out there. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Whoa. <br/>Probst: The good news is you'll receive a clue to the whereabouts of a hidden  immunity idol. Secondly, because are you not on a tribe, you are immune from the first  tribal council. You will rejoin this game by joining the tribe that does lose a member. Boat's waiting for you. Exile Island awaits. <br/>Bye, Sylvia! Good luck. <br/>Take care of yourself, woman. <br/>Be safe. Be safe. <br/>Probst: All right, let's go to today's challenge. For today's challenge, you are going to race chariots across the Fijian mud  flats. Two people will be on the chariot. The other seven will pull you across a quarter-mile course. Along the way, the two people on the chariot are responsible for retrieving  three bags of puzzle pieces. When you reach the end of the course, you'll grab a tribe flag, come all the  way back. Four tribe members will then use those puzzle pieces to solve three puzzles. This will give you the numbers you need to solve a combination wheel. You will turn it clockwise, counter-clockwise, clockwise. If you count correctly, you will find a knife. You'll take the knife, chop a rope, dropping a tribe flag. First tribe to drop their flag wins the challenge. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: The most important thing in this game, immunity. [ applause] Winning tribe gets immunity, is safe from the first tribal  council. In addition to immunity, the winning tribe gets to stay on the beach that all  19 of you put blood, sweat, and tears into building. <br/>All right, we can do this. We can do this. <br/>Probst: And when you get back, there will be a housewarming gift waiting for  you-- goblets, cutlery, a couple of hammocks, a bush shower, and a nice,  soft, comfortable couch. <br/>I think we got it. <br/>Probst: Losers will go to a new beach where you will find one pot and one  machete, and that's it. In addition, losers are going to tribal council tonight. Somebody will be the first person voted out. Give you a minute to strategize Give you a minute to strategize and we'll get  started. and we'll get started. On the chariot for Ravu, Michelle, Jessica. On the chariot for Moto, Lisi, Stacy. Stacy.

Moto thinks they have it. Moto wins immunity and reward! Moto wins immunity and reward! All right, Moto, congratulations. Immunity. Nobody going home tonight. Equally exciting, you are going back to a beach that's all waiting for you,  already constructed. You've got fire and you've got some really nice housewarming gifts. Ravu, here's a map to your new beach. Not much waiting for you-- a pot and a machete. Tonight, tribal council with me. One of the nine of you is going home. Head to your new camp. Head to your new camp. I'll see you tonight. I'll see you tonight. <br/>Whoo! <br/>We're going to enjoy this reward, baby! <br/>Oh, my god, I'm so excited. <br/>We've got a couch! <br/>Having that first win is such a huge thing for morale. We come back to our shelter, and we've got this great couch. And I almost shed a tear, I was so happy. <br/>Oh, thank you, lord! <br/>All right! <br/>All right! Candles. <br/>We got hammocks. <br/>Shower! <br/>Shower! <br/>We've got a beer mug. <br/>We've got a beer mug. <br/>Dreamz. <br/>Oh, cool. <br/>Give me that one, baby. <br/>It feels so spectacular. Not only did we get immunity, not only did we go back to the place we helped  put together. We came back with a kick-ass tribe. All right, to us, guys! <br/>To Moto! <br/>Ironically enough, Sylvia, she helped build this place, and now she's  sleeping with the now she's sleeping with the snakes. snakes. <br/>When I found out I was being exiled to Exile Island, Jeff was very clear that  it was good and there was bad. The bad was that I would be here by myself with a bunch of sea by myself with  a bunch of sea snakes. snakes. Jeff had wander me about these sea snakes and I thought he was trying to pull  my chain, you know. But it's for real. I see them still. I see them. Oh, boy. The good was that I got the immunity. And there would be a clue giving me some kind of hint about where the  immunity idol was hidden. the immunity idol was hidden. Wow, pretty spectacular. Wow, pretty spectacular. <br/>"Here you won't find the idol you crave. Search back at your camp if you hope to be saved." Okay. I've been given this opportunity of a clue. But the clue said, "Sorry, it's not here. It's back at camp." So now I have to figure out a time and a place where  I can search for it without prying eyes. That's going to be a challenge That's going to be a challenge in itself. in itself. in itself. <br/>We're home. <br/>We're home. <br/>Losing the challenge today felt horrible. All the work we put into the shelter, you know, learning the island, just  everything, you know, you get accustomed to, know, you get accustomed to,  it's gone. it's gone. <br/>We have a cave right there. <br/>Awesome. This is awesome! This place is so nice! <br/>Is it amazing? <br/>I'm glad we lost. [ laughter] Keep their stupid shower. <br/>Yeah, that cave is gorgeous. The hardest part for me was not being able to go back to that shelter that we  built. But, I mean, everybody else seems like they're okay. It's like, "Whatever. Oh, we lost it, but we're over here on this great island." I mean,  they're enjoying the blankets and pillows and the couch. We have to start all over. I'm pissed off, and I can't believe nobody else is. We worked hard on building that shelter, kitchen. We worked hard. And that hurt the most. <br/>Right now, we're back at square one, because we have nothing. And at the same time, we've got to figure out a team member to lose. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Don't get sad. <br/>Oh, I'm not sad. <br/>All right, I'm just telling you. We've got to figure out. Me... maybe me, you, and Jess, we'll figure it out, yeah? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>All right. <br/>Me, Jessica, and Rocky are really tight. really tight. We can swing the whole thing. We can swing the whole thing. <br/>And Michelle... Michelle, she's a little ninja guy. She hangs from things, she jumps around, she's really physically fit, and  that's what we need right now. <br/>I'm not getting rid of Monkey. Monkey. I call her Monkey. I call her Monkey. <br/>Like I said, I...  We need strong people. Rita has to go because Erica is strong. <br/>Erica is no joke. <br/>Yeah, she's, like... she's the real deal. So...  Okay? <br/>Yeah. <br/>All right? All right, and what a tangled web we weave. It just sucks, Jess, because I don't want to get rid of anybody. <br/>I know. I feel bad, too. <br/>I don't want to get rid of anybody, but it's the game, right? What are you going to do? <br/>We just have to stick together. <br/>We will. I just feel so safe with Rocky. I feel good now that I know it's not me, because I was working on that puzzle. We lost on the puzzle. <br/>We're thinking Jessica. <br/>Who? <br/>Jessica. <br/>She's dispensable. Her third puzzle was hers. <br/>I mean, I hear you that point. But could the third one have been harder? Was it harder? <br/>They were all same. <br/>They were all kind of the same? <br/>Yeah. <br/>That's a valid point. <br/>That's a valid point. <br/>It's over here, right? <br/>It's over here, right? <br/>I will. <br/>That way I know, all right? <br/>I will, because me, you and Erica are going to stick together. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I will tell you. <br/>We were all kind of pointing at Jessica. We all adore her. We all adore her. It's nothing personality-wise. It's nothing personality-wise. I get along super good with her. So I'm kind of hurting to have to do that. <br/>My concern is to really keep all the strong guys. <br/>I would say Rita's stronger than Jessica. than Jessica. She is. She is. <br/>I have, too. <br/>Just don't think on a personal level. Just think the next challenge. <br/>Dude, this is business. <br/>They just came to a conclusion that Jessica has to be voted out. I... I won't write Jessica's name down. name down. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. <br/>Who? How do you know that? And how did that come about? <br/>I don't know how it came about. I just know it. <br/>Just tell me who you heard it from. Huh? Everybody? Well, I'm not putting her name down. I won't put her name down. I won't put her name down. <br/>Me neither. <br/>Me neither. <br/>Tribal council tonight will be interesting. Everybody's nervous, and you still wonder in the back of your mind-- like, it  might be you. Always keep your guard up. You never know when people are trying to trick you. It's a lot of actors here, a lot of poker faces. of poker faces. This is my poker face. This is my poker face. <br/>Probst: Go ahead and grab a torch. Approach the flame. Approach the flame. Dip it in, get fire. Dip it in, get fire. This is part of the ritual of tribal council. As long as you have fire, you're still in the game. When your fire is gone, so are you. you. Take a seat. Take a seat. Michelle, how frustrating is it right now to know that there are nine people  sleeping peacefully in a shelter you helped build? <br/>It was a frustrating thought at first, but I think it's okay now. We actually really like our new island. <br/>Probst: I can't wait to hear how you've turned this in your head. Erica, what's so great about the new island that you don't miss the old one? <br/>We have an abundance of coconut. <br/>Probst: 36 days left. You better have a lot of coconuts. <br/>I mean, it's not a fantasy land. The reality is, we don't have fire. And without the fire, we don't have water. You know, and I'm glad everybody has themselves together, and we're going to  make it work. But it's going to take hard work. And it starts immediately. <br/>Probst: James, how big of an advantage is it for the other tribe to not only  have shelter, but to have fire, to have water? <br/>I think they have a huge advantage right now, but I think this group's got  something special. I think we're going to rise above and hopefully knock them off their perch  the next time we go against them in the challenge. <br/>Probst: So now you've got to vote somebody out. You haven't had much time really to even assess why you would keep somebody  or why you would get rid of somebody. So Erica, what do you use for the criteria? <br/>I think we're going to fall behind if we lose another challenge. We know everybody has something good to offer, but somebody has to go. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man, you've got to be a little concerned, with all due respect,  simply due to age. <br/>Yes, I feel very vulnerable, because I'm not... physically not the strongest  one. And in order to win the next challenge, I want to keep all the strong guys. And if everybody thinks like that, I think I'm going to be a target, and I  hope they don't. <br/>Probst: Mookie, will this tribe be better after tonight's vote? <br/>It's hard to say. I think my vote's based upon whether that person can be replaced by Sylvia. Does she or he contribute enough or more than Sylvia would? <br/>Probst: Rocky, do you think the person voted out tonight will be surprised? <br/>Yeah. I think so. I think so. I think so. Because I know if I'm voted off, I'm surprised. I'm sure if anybody here, surprise, too. So yeah, I bet there will be a big surprise coming up real soon. <br/>Probst: Rita, if it's you tonight, do you understand why they would get rid  of you? <br/>I would be very surprised. Because I think that I am contributing for us to get ahead. But I would understand. <br/>Probst: Mookie, if it's you, would you understand? <br/>No, I would not understand. <br/>Probst: Jessica, would you understand? <br/>No. I mean, if I had been laying on the beach, you know, getting some sun and  just relaxing, then maybe, yes, but no. <br/>Probst: Okay, it is time to vote. vote. Michelle, you're up. Michelle, you're up. <br/>I'm sorry. <br/>I'm sorry. This wasn't my idea. This wasn't my idea. <br/>Sorry. Nothing personal here. This is strictly mercenary.

Going to be a lot of people wondering what they did to earn a vote and what  they can do tomorrow to make sure it doesn't happen again. Because you do not have fire, you will not be taking your torches back with  you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: stay tuned for scenes  Probst: stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:  Water. Just lick some leafs, man. <br/>Ravu gets weaker. <br/>I'm starving, I'm thirsty. <br/>Earl gets primal. <br/>Sorry there, buddy-- I can't take that chance. <br/>Boo, be careful. <br/>Probst: And Boo's luck...  I need some medical. I get injured a lot. <br/>Probst: ...runs out. <br/>Boo will hurt himself out of  Boo will hurt himself out of the game. the game. <br/>I guess if you're going to get back-stabbed, it's good to get it done in the  beginning when you don't know people that well. I was absolutely shocked. I felt like I worked really hard. So I don't know where I went wrong. I feel honored to have been able to play a game that not many people get to  play. My torch may have been snuffed here, but I'm sure it's being here, but I'm  sure it's being lit somewhere else.
