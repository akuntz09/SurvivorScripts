<br/>Reunion <br/>Is that Rob? <br/>I want to win survivor. It's something I've been trying to do for ten years now, and I'm  giving it everything I got. <br/>Jeff: Rob wins immunity! <br/>Ding, ding, ding! <br/>Yeah, baby, maybe I learned something since last time. It really doesn't even Matter what the clue says 'cause I  already have the idol, so, might as well just throw it away. <br/>Okay. <br/>I'm running my tribe like the army. I'm the general, they're soldiers, and they're all doing as  they're told. <br/>Jeff: Matt, the tribe has spoken. <br/>One man should not have this much power in this game. Luckily, I'm not an ordinary man. Superman. <br/>Superman. [band playing] [applause]  Jeff: welcome to the survivor: Redemption Island live  reunion show. Congratulations, Boston Rob. Four times... [applause and cheering] and a record 117 days  played in this game. Coming in to this, knowing you had... You had... Obviously, you  had a target on your back. <br/>Right. <br/>Jeff: what odds did you give yourself? <br/>Well, you know, I knew from the very beginning, that if I  was able to get my foot in the door, if I could get these people to at least  play with me, that I would have a shot. You know, they didn't realize how nervous I was the first day I  was out there. They held all the power. But they didn't know that. So I knew if I could get in and start to build relationships,  and I could show them that I would be helpful around camp, that, you know, I  could get in a good alliance, and then work my way from there. <br/>Jeff: was there a key moment the first few days? <br/>Uh, yes and no. I mean, Kristina, going and looking for the idol feverishly on  the first day, kind of put a target on her. And, you know, building the shelter and working together with  everybody, I kind of showed them that, you know what? I have some experience, and let me show you how, because, you  know what? Even if I get all the way to the end, nobody will vote for me to  win. And that's, you know...  Jeff: when you were assessing who to make your alliance  with off the top, what was the thought process? Why did you end up with who you had in your group? <br/>Loyalty... At first. You know, that was the main thing. Natalie, I knew that, you know, she was young, and that she  needed someone to help, you know, go through this game with, and that I could  be that person for her. And in return, she would, you know, stay loyal to me. <br/>Jeff: One of the things that I heard all season was,  nobody in your alliance talked to anybody else. <br/>Right. <br/>Jeff: It was kind of cult-like. <br/>You know what? [laughter] it was to a degree. But it was a lot of hard work, too. It looks easy when you're sitting at home watching it, but I  would constantly be going back and checking with each and every member and  making sure that nobody was talking to anybody else, and if they were, I  pretended to have an open-door policy with everybody where we all put  everything on the table. Of course, I kept a lot of it to myself. But it was a lot of hard work. It wasn't as easy as it looked. <br/>Jeff: Ashley, what happened? You know, I was tweeting live during these episodes, and the one  thing that kept coming up is, "Why aren't these girls flipping it on Rob?"  why did it never happen? <br/>There was a pivotal point when I had won immunity going  into... I think, Andrea had just come back from redemption. And we knew-- Natalie and I knew-- that Rob had an idol. We knew that. He told us that he found an idol after the merge. So, we were like... I was... I don't know. You're so scared when you're out there, or something. Like, it was just, we knew he was going to play the idol. And at that point, I had immunity, and I felt like I had control  and that was the best move for me. <br/>Jeff: I got to interrupt. I don't know if we can hear this, but that... Is that your baby? That's Boston Rob's baby out there, and daughter saying,  "Daddy, daddy, daddy." [applause] I think we understand why. And amber, if you need to leave, if they get too loud, you just skedaddle. It's fine. No hard feelings. Andrea, you're at home now watching this whole thing play out. What do you take from how Rob played? <br/>Rob played a brilliant game, and also what you don't see  is, the way he built relationships with each of us was so individual that you  felt... You know, I looked at him as an older brother. We spent two days building a daybed for no reason. And you look at those relationships, and you feel close to  someone. We all, Grant, all of us, had this different relationship with Rob,  and that's just brilliant, 'cause he makes...  Jeff: what it you learn? If you played again, what did you take from this? <br/>That you have to be constantly checking in with everybody,  and saying, "What are you talking about? What are you doing? What were you talking about over there?" 'cause you see he  does that with everyone and you become comfortable. Everything he does with checking in, just constantly knowing  what's going on. Never become comfortable, either. <br/>Jeff: Rob, what did you see in Phillip that nobody else  did? <br/>Here's the thing about Phillip. With all the talk that was said back and forth, Phillip is a  lovable guy. He's a guy that... You know, if you just listen to him for a second  and listen to the story that he's trying to tell. <br/>He comes from a family of six...  12. <br/>12. <br/>He left home at 16. He's going on and on. And just imagine what that's like for a minute to come from a  family of 12. You've got to be constantly fighting for attention. And I just said, you know what? Here's a guy that if I show him some love, he will... He will be  there for me. I mean, it's not any different than what any of us want. You know, we all want to be loved, and we all want to be heard. So, everybody else would be giving it to Phillip for giving 'em  a hard time. I mean, socially, there were times where you weren't, you  know... [laughter] it wasn't a picnic. But at the same time, he was someone that, you know, I could go  to and I could find a common ground, and we could exchange, you know, and  have an exchange on that. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, I... [applause] I want to talk to you later  in the show, but I got to ask right now. You seem... Either you're just very reserved, or you're down. Are you down right now? <br/>No, I'm attentive, and I'm listening and, uh...  Jeff: quick, tell me what I'm thinking. <br/>Huh? <br/>Jeff: what am I thinking? <br/>What you're thinking right now is, "What is Phillip  really thinking?" [laughter] [applause]  Jeff: Natalie, did your loyalty to Rob ever waiver, even  though we might not have seen it in the show? Did you truly consider turning on him at any point? <br/>I mean, I think I would have if he didn't have the idol,  but because he did, like Ashley was saying, I mean, we couldn't vote for him. We knew it was the last time he could play the idol. There's no way he wouldn't. So I put myself in a position where either, basically, I'm going  to the end no Matter what, because I have Ashley, and I have Rob. <br/>Jeff: how was the final tribal for you? Julie was particularly harsh on you. You were, Julie. <br/>I was. Yes. <br/>Jeff: I mean, as a mother yourself, those were pretty  tough words to say to a young woman. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: how did it impact you? <br/>I think I'm stronger than I think I am. Because in my life, I... I've given to what people say, and I  think what this experience has given me is just, like, take it with a grain  of salt, and move on. Move on, because... [applause]  Jeff: Julie, when you saw that played back, any regrets on  that? <br/>Um, you know, now that we're sitting here, yes. Yes, because Natalie is a great person. But what I lived through was so much frustration because here's  these women that are just being blindsided by this guy that's played the game  four times. I just wanted to shake them, and, "Come on! Wake up! We can do a female alliance."  But that would have...  And hats off to Rob's leadership. <br/>Jeff: well, I mean, the obvious comeback is, "I made  it to the final three. You're back row, jury."  Yes, absolutely, absolutely, you're right. <br/>Jeff: right? <br/>Absolutely, and my hat's off to them. It is. <br/>Jeff: Rob, one of the things that started happening with  the Ometepe six, is that after you guys had the easy votes to get rid of Zapatera,  then you had to turn on each other, and the one that I think... The one that  got to me the most was you and Grant. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Because knowing you, after you played so many times,  I have a pretty good idea of what you're like. That you and Grant, in normal life, would pRobably be the  closest of anybody here. Have you repaired that damage? <br/>You know, it was really tough, you know, watching it back. Grant and I communicated quite a bit when we got back from  nicaragua. And when... When the show first started. And I stopped hearing from him, pRobably about three or four  episodes in. And he wouldn't return my phone call, wouldn't return a text  from me. And I just want to say, bro, that, uh, if I hurt your feelings,  I'm sorry. I was just playing a game, but, you know, no hard feelings. We haven't really got to that point. We've seen each other all day today, and...  Jeff: 'cause Grant, certainly, I'm not Phillip. I am not a specialist, nor can I read your mind, but I can read  body language, and your body language looks right now you might jump Rob,  rather than hug Rob. <br/>Um, there comes... There comes a point where you have to--  in this game survivor-- where it becomes, where do you draw the line between,  I'm going to call this a game, where in actuality, it's a direct reflection  of your life, of who you are. And as much as we can cop out, so to speak, and say this is a  game, for me, the experience was much... The experience was much different  than that. <br/>Jeff: Rob, do you think that might be in part because  you've played so many times? Do you start to learn how to not take this game personally? <br/>Well, you know what, I think you have to, in your mind  set... If you... Let's put it this way. If you draw a line in the sand and say, "I will not cross  this line," then you get out there on the island, and start playing the  game, then you're going to be constantly flirting with, am I going to go over  this line? Am I not going to go over this line? It's a lot easier to say, "I'm playing a game, and I'm  going to do whatever it takes to win." at the same time, I understand  his point of view because you're out there living with these people 24 hours  a day, so the relationships you make are real. At the end of the day, I looked at it like, I'm going to try to  win a million dollars for my family. <br/>Jeff: well, I got to say, I've annoyed a lot of people  over the seasons by having an opinion. I have one now. For my money, in 22 seasons, that's as close to a perfect game  as anybody's ever played on survivor. [applause and cheering] coming up next, Russell hantz. Has he recovered from his early demise? Matt spent 27 days on Redemption Island. It nearly broke his spirit. And Phillip, was there a method to his madness, or is Phillip  just mad? We will find out. We are live in new york. It is the survivor: Redemption Island reunion show. We'll be right back. [applause and cheering]  It's called stealth. <br/>Ah. <br/>And I am known as the specialist. Boston Rob, the mentalist. Where's Grant? Better known as the assassin. <br/>Jeff: wow. <br/>At one point, I was actually part of a tribe. <br/>Jeff: Matt is in the water! <br/>And I got blindsided. <br/>Jeff: Matt, grab your torch, head to Redemption Island. <br/>If god wants me to go a step further, so be it. <br/>Jeff: Matt seizes the moment and will re-enter this game. <br/>You guys, give me a minute. <br/>Jeff: Matt, you need to bring me your torch. <br/>The game of survivoris long and painful. God has literally been carrying me. But I wouldn't change anything. [band playing] [applause]  Jeff: welcome back to the survivor: Redemption Island  reunion show. Matt, clarify. Was it 27 or 29 days? <br/>I was out there so long, I started to lose my memories. <br/>Jeff: Either way, you have a few records. You have the most days spent ever on Redemption Island. Somewhere around a month. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: You won ten out of 11 duels. And you were the... [applause and cheering] you were the first  person to be blindsided twice. [laughter] in the same season. It seemed like it took a really big toll on you emotionally. How bad did it get for you? <br/>Um, I mean, my lowest point was definitely when I broke  and you saw me crying. And talking about god carrying me. That was so true. But I think that was even after the duel with Julie. I was just so over the game. I felt so alone. I was completely exhausted. <br/>Jeff: well, there was a time to remind people when you  said, "I want to go home unless god doesn't want me to," and god didn't  want you to, and he gave you another week or so. <br/>Yeah. That's definitely true. I mean, god does what he wants to. And we have to be respectful of that, whether it's what we want  or not. But, really, I'm just so thankful for the way that everything  came out. It was really a life-changing experience, and I loved every  minute of it. <br/>Jeff: how so? What did you learn? <br/>Um, well, I started the game deciding that I was going to  blindly follow my heart, and I take away from it that following your heart doesn't  necessarily mean ignoring logic and reason, but... [laughter] but it's  important to evaluate the context of the situation you find yourself in. And make an educated decision with what you know and go from  there, and so...  Jeff: Can you describe what it's like to be out...? Because you spent a lot of that time alone. <br/>I did spend a lot of that time alone. And I have a stellar nicaraguan rock collection. [laughter] but it's really difficult. Just the simple tasks become impossible-- collecting firewood,  starting the fire, cooking the rice, cleaning the pots. It's very lonely and kind of miserable at times. <br/>Jeff: what does your family and friends say about, you  know, what you went through and what they saw? You were very exposed out there a lot. <br/>Um, I mean, everyone says that their hearts were just  breaking for me, but at the same time they're, like, "Wow, the way you  got to talk about your faith and talk about what god was doing for you, so  incredible." and the people who know me really well think,  "Redemption island was the best place for you since you like to be by  yourself so much." [laughter]  Jeff: Andrea, there was some talk or speculation that  maybe there was a little connection going on there, love-wise? Any love interest between you and Matt? <br/>Uh, Matt's cute. I mean, look at him. I think we can all agree. <br/>Jeff: Andrea. <br/>What? [laughter]  I don't know. I think Matt's cool. I'm pRobably blushing. <br/>Yes. That was a yes. <br/>Jeff: That's a yes? <br/>That's a yes. <br/>Jeff: Matt, is there anything? Have you guys spoken, talked, gone on a date? <br/>Well, I'm in nashville, and she's in wisconsin, so it's a  pretty big distance. We definitely had a connection on the island, and I'd  say...  Jeff: And we'll be friends forever. Okay, I got it. Mike, you served... In fact, I think we have a photo of you from  the war. You've been in our armed forces. You've been out there. [applause and cheering] protecting our country. So... So you have an idea of what it's like to go through something  tough. How... And this is a tough comparison to make, but is there any  parallel between the deprivation you go through on this show? <br/>Well, Jeff, there's a lot of soul-searching that went on  with me. "Survivor" transformed me as a human being, as a man,  as an american. I-- it helped me understand my purpose and what-- what I'm doing  with my life. I got closer to god. It was great to have talks with Matt. God bless our-- our troops and our service members [ cheers and  applause ] god bless them. "Survivor--" "Survivor" is a challenge. It's a challenge. I signed up-- in the marine corps I still bleed green. My heart bleeds green. Once a marine, always a marine. And the strife and the hardship that we go through over in iraq,  or over in afghanistan, or wherever-- wherever our troops are, does not  compare to "Survivor." however, "Survivor" is very real  and very difficult. Your life's just not on the line. You know. And --  How many times a night, as we go to break, do you think  about that last challenge and how close you might have been to a million  dollars? <br/>I was tired of coming in second place, Jeff. You know, there were so many challenges where I almost had  immunity. Our tribe was one down at the merge. We almost had Matt. We almost had him. And I wanted to win "Survivor." took out Russell  hantz. I had Rob in my crosshairs. I didn't have enough to get him. I love this game. I'm passionate about it. And, you know, I really, really had a great experience. It was great for me. <br/>Jeff: All right, still to come. Sprint is going to award $100,000 to one of the season's  castaways based on your votes. Up next, he came into this season the most notorious villain in  "Survivor" history. He went out in tears. Will evil Russell ever play again? And the answer to the biggest question of the season-- is Phillip  sheppard really a former federal agent? We'll be right back. [ cheers and applause ]  My trunks were hidden so my great-great grandfather came  to me in a vision and he said, "Look near the water pole." am I  good or what? Don't mess with the undercover specialist. <br/>Jeff: Russell, you are out of this game. Is it embarrassment at finally losing? <br/>No. I respect this game too much to go out this way. [ applause ]  Jeff: welcome back to the "Survivor: Redemption  Island" reunion show. We're live in new york city. Russell hantz, what was it like? What did your fans say when they saw you cry? <br/>It's just rough. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life, you know,  and it's so emotionally-- you get so emotionally involved, especially after  playing three times. But I-- you know, first of all, I have to say,-- I have to  congratulate Rob. And he played an excellent game. And I want to see if he's going to shake my hand this time. Rob? <br/>Oh! [ applause ]  Jeff: Yeah, it was really-- at the end of the  "Heroes-villains" live show that whole idea was born when you guys  challenged each other. So Zapatera, your tribe, so wanted you out of this game, they  threw a challenge to get you out. Is that fair in "Survivor"? <br/>You see, the amazing thing, I'm-- you're such a great host  and you're not asking the question that I'm sure everybody wants to hear and  that question is do you regret your decision in throwing a challenge seven  days in for a million dollars? Now we've got-- I'm half this man's size and he's scared of me? I got two people in my alliance, two. And they've got six. It's impossible-- they can control me. But I can't make things disappear and appear. I know they might think I can. But I can't just make things vanish. So just try to control me. And, you know, it makes me sick to my stomach when I hear Steve  tell people like Phillip that he's not a man when this man gave up-- gave up  his momentum, a professional football player, threw in the towel, and-- in a  game-- Jeff, you have to tell me that they had a bounty on my head. How in the world-- you know, I can't think they're that idiots. I can't think that they're that stupid. <br/>Jeff: Phillip with all this-- uhm-- that you have going on  right now--  Russell. <br/>Jeff: Russell, sorry. Wow! I don't know if that was freudian or what. Maybe you two should show down next, Phillip and Russell. The specialist might have your number. So, Russell, with everything you have going on inside you right  now, I can still see that you're amped about this game. Your last words were,"I'm done. I'll never play again." has that changed? Is the door open that you might play again? <br/>It's like a piece of me. It's a part of me, you know, and it's hard to-- I gotta say-- I  gotta say no, but it's so ingrained in me. <br/>Jeff: Should we not call? [ laughter ] do you want us to throw your number away? Yes or no? Yes or no? <br/>I'm two-time fan favorite right now. <br/>Jeff: Do you want me to keep the phone number or dump it? Yes or no? <br/>Just keep my number. <br/>Jeff: All right. Well, Russell was one of the most polarizing survivors in  history. Until Phillip showed up. <br/>I'm a former federal agent. That's right, special agent sheppard. I'm a former special agent. A federal agent. I worked for the government as a federal agent in the department  that I work in. I'm a former federal agent. I did it for three separate agencies. And I am known as "The specialist." [ applause ]  Jeff: Phillip sheppard. So, was there-- was there a method to your madness? <br/>Absolutely. I woke up on day two, and saw that Boston Rob had a grip on the  tribe. And I went four more days, and that grip was unchanging. This was no window for me to talk to anybody in my tribe. So I came up with a plan. How do you get close to the guy who's going to control this  tribe? And that was be the most villainous person while-- within our  tribe-- to make sure that they would see-- Rob would see that I was the focus,  and that would keep the focus off of him and he would appreciate that. <br/>Jeff: what's been the reaction on the street from people? Clearly, people love or hate you. <br/>They absolutely love me. I don't run into anybody that does not love me [ applause ] most  people describe it-- describe me as "You're a brilliant player."  and there was one other component to my game that was missed by most, and  that is I played with a certain level of integrity. I was not going to trade my integrity for a million dollars. <br/>Jeff: I know, something that went on just-- just-- does  that surprise you that people laugh? These guys are laughing. The people in the audience are laughing. You just gave a very heart-felt comment. <br/>It doesn't surprise me. I would ask the audience just to know whenever you saw an  interview with me, not one time that I recall did you ever hear me talk about  any one member of this entire audience, even when--  You talked about me all the time. <br/>No, excuse me. When I would talk about you, I would talk about you to your  face. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, this is why you're great. This is why Phillip is great. <br/>Excuse me, excuse me --  Phillip, hold on -- I know, I know. Stop. <br/>I said in the interview. <br/>Jeff: Stop, stop, Phillip, we're live. You know I'm your biggest fan, and I want to get to the bottom  of something-- two things quickly, quickly. Okay, one is very heated discussion between you and Steve about  race. "Survivor's" a tough game, I know. Have you guys healed that wound? <br/>We haven't, but we are. You know, the specialist doesn't make a mistake, but he made one  in this game. Steve, I hope you accept my apology. <br/>I do, always [ applause ]  Jeff: Now there's one more big question. All right, this is what I know for sure. Throw up the photo, michael. I know you served in the army in 1984. There's Phillip sheppard as a young man. Now you've told everybody you're a former federal agent. What agency did you serve with? <br/>I served with the defense investigative services as a  special agent and I also worked with the naval investigative service as an  adjudicator. <br/>Jeff: Now, to make sure this is authenticated, we have  brought somebody from your past that I'm going to go interview right now, and  we're going to find out if this is true. Diane hardy, stand up, please. Okay, now I met diane earlier. I've seen your credentials. I saw the shiny badge. I saw it all. You are an active federal agent. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: how do you know Phillip sheppard? <br/>Phillip and I met one another, we attended the training  academy, and Phillip was an outstanding student, in my opinion [ applause  ]  Jeff: Now, are you saying this because you think he needs  some help? <br/>No, no. Before the training, we're given a manual. And Phillip came to the academy. He knew the manual inside out. It was as if though he memorized the manual. After the training we went to different locations so I did not  work on the job with Phillip. But I know if he conducted himself as he did at the training  academy, he was an outstanding federal agent. <br/>Jeff: Thanks, diane [ applause ] you can sit. You can sit. Thank you. So does that answer the question? Do we buy this? Phillip, people are still unsure. Even diane hardy can't convince them, and she is an active  federal agent. To be continued, my friend. The question remains and so will the question mark. Up next, find out the sprint player of the season. And later an exclusive peek at where we are headed for season 23  and taking us to the break our survivor composers, russ landow and David  vannacor. [ applause ]  Jeff: welcome back. Well, since wednesday, viewers have been texting and voting  online for the sprint player of the season, the honor also includes $100,000  cash prize. The votes are in, and it was very, very close this year. It came down to two people. Two of you dominated the voting. Two of you gathered 76% of the vote between the two of you. Those two are Boston Rob and Matt. [ applause ] the veteran and the newbie. The guy who was in control of blindsiding the other one. It was a 40%-36% vote. That's how close it was. Polarizing, very different, faith, god, god, god. Godfather. I will cut you [ laughter ] the votes are in. The winner of the sprint $100,000 cash prize, it is a clean  sweep. Rob mariano. Nicely done. Amber's going to go shopping! <br/>Yeah, she is. Thank you. <br/>Jeff: I just want to pop around. I noticed something in the last episode, Ralph, when we got to  the vote, I sensed an-- a real affection between you and Phillip. Do you like Phillip? Is there a friendship here? <br/>Nah, Phillip he's a great guy. I figured pretty quick that's the way he was playing the game. <br/>Jeff: And, Grant, you're married now? <br/>I am married, yeah. <br/>Jeff: That's going to get some boos from the women. <br/>That's okay. <br/>Jeff: Congratulations. <br/>Thank you very much. About a week after I got back. <br/>Jeff: Fantastic. <br/>Proposed right at the airport as we landed coming back  from nicaragua. Yeah. There's Kristina. She's right out there. <br/>Jeff: For those of you-- oh, there she is. Beautiful woman. And I heard a rumor that I'd like to investigate quickly that  there is another love affair, that "Survivor" has blossomed yet  another love affair and typically at tribal council I would go digging until  I found it but since it's love and love is tender and beautiful, David, why  don't you just tell me about this. Is it true? Are you dating another "Survivor."  I am, not a current cast member. A former cast member. We met shortly after the season. <br/>Jeff: who is it? <br/>Carolina. <br/>Carolina eastwood. Was it love at first sight. <br/>I don't know if I would go so far as to say it was love at  first sight. She put me in my place before she gave me the time of day but  she came around. <br/>Jeff: how is the relationship going right now? <br/>It's going very well. Things are going pretty good. <br/>Jeff: Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: All right. [ laughter ] wait a second. How well is it going? <br/>It's going very well. <br/>Jeff: really? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: like very well as in, gee, I'd like to maybe really  make this official? <br/>Yeah, I think that's kind of a good idea right now. <br/>Shut up! <br/>Carolina you are the most amazing woman I have ever  met--  Shut it down right now. Shut it down. <br/>You drive me nuts but at the end of the day you make me  happier than I ever could be. Will you marry me? <br/>Shut the flipping-- "Survivor" loves blindsiding  me. Yes, yes, oh, my god, yes. You guys really like blindsiding me. <br/>Jeff: All right, well you never know what you're going to  get when you watch "Survivor" live. After 22 seasons, the game continues to surprise even those that  were on years ago. And we are still going strong. Find out where "Survivor" is headed next right after  this. Redemption island. It was a twist that changed the game. And next season, Redemption Island is back. 16 new castaways will embark on the adventure of a lifetime as  they are abandoned in the south pacific. They will face unrelenting storms, scorching temperatures and  unforgiving waters. They will be joined by two returning players who are seeking  their own shot at redemption. Who will have what it takes to outwit, outplay, and outlast all  the rest? Find out this fall on "Survivor: South pacific."
