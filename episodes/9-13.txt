<br/> <br/>Jeff Probst: Previously, on Survivor:  <br/>Screwed you, didn't I?  <br/>You didn't screw me. I'm still in the game. You screwed  Leann.  <br/>Probst: While Ami felt betrayed after her ally Leann was  voted out, Twila and Scout felt good about what they had done.  <br/>We've overthrown the queen. I have a great mind sometimes.  I love it.  <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge...  <br/>No way.  <br/>Probst: ...the tribe learned that the first-place finisher  would win a new car.  <br/>Nice.  <br/>Probst: And that the winner and the two runners-up would  drive to the other side of the island for a night of pampering. Survivors  ready... go! Ami first in to dive for her flag. Ami led the entire race, but  in the end... Nice job. ...Eliza came away with the car and Ami placed  second. Chris, the third-place finisher going on the overnight reward. (cheering)  Eliza, Ami and Chris drove to a luxury spot.  <br/>Oh, my gosh.  <br/>And enjoyed a hot shower, local entertainment...  <br/>I'm not stopping anytime soon.  <br/>...and an all-you-can- eat gourmet dinner.  <br/>Listen...  <br/>Probst: Ami worked strategy on Chris and Eliza.  <br/>I think it would be really smart for you guys, is to break  up Scout and Twila.  <br/>Probst: But Chris wasn't about to let Ami stay in the  game.  <br/>Does she think I'm stupid, you know? She's still working Eliza,  though. She's strategizing. We're pure final four and look at our  competition, a 60-year- old woman and Twila. I'm counting on the fact that  Eliza is mentally strong.  <br/>Good night, Chris.  <br/>Probst: But when Ami was alone with Eliza, the strategy  talk continued.  <br/>Every single time I've had your back.  <br/>ELIZA: Ami has stood up for me a lot of times. Ami has  been like a big sister to me out here.  <br/>Probst: At the Immunity Challenge, it came down to Chris  and Ami... Chris is on! ...but Ami couldn't come through. Chris wins  immunity. And Chris was safe for three more days. Back at camp, Eliza  considered siding with Ami and Julie to vote out Scout.  <br/>Oh, she would be so mad. I'm not afraid to change things  if I think that it's going to get me farther in this game.  <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Ami confronted Twila about  swearing on her son's name and then breaking their alliance.  <br/>TWILA: I am not the only friggin' person that has lied in  this game. You've been had. Screw you.  <br/>But when you bring in the one thing that you say is the  most sacred thing to you in the world, to me that is not worth a million  dollars.  <br/>Probst: And though Eliza agreed with Ami about Twila's  deception...  <br/>Twila swore on her son, the one thing that someone could  say to convince me. I'm, like, "Oh, well, then they must be true to  their word."  <br/>Probst: ...she cast a vote against her big sister. Ami,  the tribe has spoken. Five are left. Who will be voted out tonight? (theme  song playing)  <br/>It's a light night out.  <br/>Incredibly beautiful night.  <br/>After Tribal Council, we got back to the camp and  everything was good. Ami was gone, one less worry and I'm the last man  standing. It seemed like it was going to be just a quiet, you know,  easy-going night, but there was still a lot of emotion stirring in Twila. The  fact that Eliza had brought up Twila swearing on her son's name.  <br/>Sorry, T.  <br/>You don't know how bad I feel about saying that, and then  you just keep rubbing salt in the wound, which is fine.  <br/>You know what...  <br/>But the only one I want to worry about it with is my son,  when I go home.  <br/>We're all dropping it, completely, and I'm sorry I brought  it up.  <br/>Because I am, you know, I'm sorry I ever said it. I am so  sorry that I ever made that statement. I am tired of it. I'm tired of hearing  about it, period. The only one that I've got to condole with or say anything  to is my son when I get home. The rest of you mother ... can kiss my ...  period.  <br/>Yeah, we're past it and we're over it.  <br/>Yeah, everybody's over it.  <br/>I think that's a little uncalled for.  <br/>I was apologizing. I was apologizing. There's no need  to...  <br/>I think it's a lot called for, Julie.  <br/>Why?  <br/>You all keep ... dogging me about this ... and I'm sick of  it.  <br/>Your son?  <br/>So let it go.  <br/>I haven't... your son?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>I haven't brought up your son once.  <br/>Oh, ...  <br/>Twila's outburst really looked like a heinous insecurity  just projected on us. And I'm actually kind of glad she did it, 'cause I know  it completely turned everybody off and I'm going to use it against her later  on. That was so uncalled for.  <br/>That was so... I was apologizing for bringing up something  that she didn't want me to bring up.  <br/>You know what?  <br/>And she was like, "Mother... go to hell." I'm  like, "Oh, my God."  <br/>I know.  <br/>It's shocking. Nobody speaks to me like that. Nobody  speaks to me like that, and I don't... I don't tolerate it. I guess Twila got  a little upset at Tribal Council, but she got even more upset when we got  back and she was cursing at me. Yes, I brought up the fact that she swore on  her son to both me and somebody else, and one of those times it was a lie, so  it made me wary of the fact that she had sworn on her son to me. You know,  she's the one who did it. If you can't live with your past actions, you shouldn't  have done it. (thumping)  <br/>Good morning.  <br/>Against herself, towards us, more so towards you.  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>I knew that it wasn't a good thing what Twila was doing.  She definitely offended Julie. She definitely offended Eliza. Eliza being  part of this four- person alliance with Scout, Twila and myself, you know,  it's important to try to keep a level, you know, understanding. She's taken a  road she doesn't need to take. It's dangerous for her position in the  game.  <br/>Why would it be a big deal to vote Twila off instead of  me?  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>Just from your perspective, your position.  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I don't think it would. I would definitely consider making  a deal with Julie. Sometimes when it's in your best interest to abandon an  alliance, you have to do that to get yourself further in the game.  <br/>Right. I mean, Chris is like either/or, 'cause he could  win against me. And if anything, Twila's his semi-competition, and I'll talk  to him about it.  <br/>Just say, "Oh, I mentioned it to Eliza and I told her  I was going to talk to you." Don't say...  <br/>I'm not gonna... yeah, I'm not saying you're agreeing. All  day I've been shuffling my ideas and my plan to Eliza. I've been playing up  the fact that we want to get rid of Twila. But her only dilemma is that she  is going to be faithful to Chris and if Chris doesn't buy it, then there's no  point. So I have to approach Chris in an appropriate time and manner. You  know, it's all benching on that for me. It could either continue my game or  end it abruptly.  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Okay. Today's reward challenge  will give you a second chance with some challenges you have tackled in the  past. All five of you will go through the mud pit. The first four to get to  the other side move on to the next round. Those four will tackle the pigpen,  where you must get inside the pigpen, get a pig and get that pig in its cage.  The first three to do this move on to the next round, where you must put  together a Tiki puzzle. The first two to correctly solve the Tiki puzzle move  to the final round. The last two will race up and across a balance beam, down  the other side where, using a slingshot, you must break three tiles. You'll  raise a torch, torch will light the wok, you win reward.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Probst: Want to know what you're playing for?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Probst: For the winner, you will take a horseback  ride.  <br/>Ooh!  <br/>My favorite.  <br/>Probst: And you will end up at Mount Yasur, one of the  most active volcanoes in the world. Of course, you'll have a little snack  fitting for volcano viewing: hot dogs.  <br/>Oh, my God, Jeff.  <br/>Probst: Wine and/or hot chocolate and beer. You'll spend  the night at Mount Yasur. Worth playing for?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Probst: All right. We're going to draw numbers for  position. We'll get started. First four through the mud pit move on to the  next round. Survivors, ready. Go! Chris, Twila, Eliza with a slight lead and  then Julie and then Scout. Twila and Eliza. Chris bringing it on. Julie  struggling, but she's still ahead of Scout. First four across, Chris is  across, Eliza is across, Twila is across and Julie moving on to the next  round. Scout is the first one eliminated. Here we go, the first three to  catch a pig that has an orange stripe and get that pig in its cage moves on  to the next round. Survivors ready. Go! (pigs squealing) Chris has one.  (squealing) Julie and Eliza fighting for one. Eliza had it and she lost it.  Julie has one. Chris is in.  <br/>Go, Twila. Go, go, go.  <br/>Probst: Julie is moving on. And Twila moving on to the  next round.  <br/>Nice try, honey.  <br/>Probst: Eliza's out. First two to correctly get their Tiki  put together move on. Survivors, ready. Go! Got to untie knots, take the  puzzle apart and then put it back together again. Chris and Twila wasting no  time. Julie going to untie all her knots first. Julie has all the knots  undone. Chris has all his pieces off, Julie right behind... Twila right  behind. Chris is going to do his on the ground. First two move on.  <br/>I think I got it.  <br/>Probst: That's not right. Two people are moving on to the  final.  <br/>Please say yes.  <br/>Probst: Twila's right. She's moving on.  <br/>Yes, whoo!  <br/>Way to go, Twila!  <br/>Probst: Chris, trying to figure out where he's gone wrong.  Julie's right, moving on. Julie and Twila in the final. Chris, one piece over  there you never used. This piece right here.  <br/>No, I didn't see that.  <br/>Probst: Final two, Twila and Julie, for a horseback ride  to Mount Yasur. Survivors, ready. Go! Twila trips on the ladder, Julie with a  little bit of a lead. Got to get across this balance beam. Julie is first  over. Twila still doing well on the beam. Time to catch up. Julie untying her  slingshot. Twila took a big fall on the net, she's hurt. Julie untying the  slingshot. Twila making short order of the knot. Twila starting to catch up.  Julie has her slingshot, got to break three plates, releasing them from the  wires. Julie is going to get the first shot in. Twila right behind. Julie,  with one shot, breaks her first plate.  <br/>Way to go, Julie.  <br/>Probst: Julie lines up for her second shot. Julie breaks  her second plate. Twila breaks her first plate.  <br/>I'm winning this.  <br/>Probst: Julie says she's going to win it. She's got one  plate left... and she does. (scattered cheers) Julie going to Mount  Yasur.  <br/>Way to go, Julie.  <br/>Probst: All right, Julie, nice effort. You're going to  Mount Yasur-- horseback ride, hot dogs, beer. Who you taking with you?  <br/>Well, it's ironic, 'cause none of these people would've  taken me, so I'm gonna take Chris. (groans): Oh... brother.  <br/>Probst: All right. You three, nice effort. Heading back to  camp muddy. Head on out.  <br/>Julie won the reward. And she picked me, and we cleaned up  after the muddy challenge we went through. And we journeyed through the  jungle and we finally come out into this extremely ashy, dense area.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Lord, that thing is mammoth.  <br/>The decision to bring Chris-- I knew none of them were  going to bring me-- but Chris I had the funnest with, I needed to talk to,  and he's my door to open to get me further in this game, so it only made  sense to bring Chris.  <br/>Hello.  <br/>Hello, hello.  <br/>Julie.  <br/>Joe? Okay.  <br/>Okay, Joe.  <br/>Let's go. Let's take a walk up there.  <br/>Okay, let's go.  <br/>Oh, yeah!  <br/>Oh, Chris, can you believe it?  <br/>This is beautiful.  <br/>Wow. Wow. Whoa. Hope you make it.  <br/>He's awful nervous.  <br/>There was one part when we were crossing the river, okay,  and Chris is in the river just looking around. And he just looked so hopeless  out there, I just couldn't help but laugh.  <br/>He's not wanting to go nowhere.  <br/>Yeah? Just give a kick. Kick on the side. (clicking  tongue)  <br/>Kick him?  <br/>Kick, yeah. Stronger.  <br/>This horse and me had trouble getting to know each other  at first, you know? It took us a while to, you know, build a trusting  relationship. Go. Whoa! So, okay, well, off to a little bit of a rough start  on the horse, but everything else went great. This is beautiful.  <br/>Isn't it?  <br/>We walked down this long trail, and it was awesome just  looking at everything on our way up.  <br/>Finally, we come around the far side of Mount Yasur.  <br/>Here we are. This is your hut for the night.  <br/>Ow! Oh, my God! I see foot-long hot dogs, huge rolls,  onions and relish, wine, beer. We are thrilled, so we're like, "Okay,  what can we do? Let's get going."  <br/>Guys...  <br/>Yeah. Joe comes back and he's, like, "Bring the hot  dogs. We're going to heat them in the vent." You look around, there's  all these steam vents coming up. It was probably about ten feet away.  <br/>This is nice and warm.  <br/>Oh, wow.  <br/>Nice and hot, see?  <br/>Is it hot enough it'll cook this?  <br/>Yes. Sure.  <br/>Great little oven.  <br/>Oh! I'm sorry. That is hot.  <br/>Yeah. We go over to the vent, and put some corn in the  bottom, and just stick them in. Three minutes later, they're ready.  <br/>Okay... Oh, yeah, look at that.  <br/>You think?  <br/>Yeah. Take a bite. Mine's cooked.  <br/>We'll leave the corns for...  <br/>God, oh, my God. So we doll up our rolls and we ate just  four hot dogs nonstop, foot-long, great, yum. I was in heaven. Oh, my God,  Chris.  <br/>You know, Julie won the reward. It didn't surprise me that  she picked me. She wants to go further in the game, and she knows that her  name is coming up for elimination.  <br/>Are you a lot tighter with Twila than I thought you  were?  <br/>Um... no, I've never been real tight with Twila.  <br/>Right. So who do you feel most loyal to?  <br/>Since the merge, you. You've never done nothing... you've  done nothing but help me since then. I see that. I know that. Me and Julie  got a little bit of, you know, a bond between us, you know. She let me know  that she doesn't want to leave. She wants to stay in the game.  <br/>Eliza's like, "I'm aligned with everyone, but Chris  is the only one... if you talk to him then I'll consider." She's like,  "I'll go along with it if Chris goes along with it."  <br/>Well, that's because she told me I'm the only one she  trusts now.  <br/>Right.  <br/>I don't know, Julie worked it pretty good. There's nothing  that Julie or Eliza would like more than for me to jump on their side and  vote off Twila. And I didn't tell her no. I'm the last guy standing. I sit  and I think, "Is this a bad thing or a good thing?" I just haven't  decided yet. Sure, I mean, I know darn well you could influence Eliza.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Without a doubt. And, yeah, the three of us could  completely turn the game around.  <br/>Chris was very open-minded and he's open to help me  progress in the game, so Chris is my rock right now.  <br/>Get them bananas over here and just start cutting some of  them up and put them in a soup just so they don't go to waste.  <br/>You want to bury the other ones?  <br/>The big ones?  <br/>Yeah. Where are they?  <br/>Did I unbury them or do you want to bury the rest of  them?  <br/>No, did you unbury?  <br/>Nope, I didn't.  <br/>Where are they?  <br/>I'm not telling.  <br/>T...?  <br/>If you ask me one more time, I'm going to let the damn  things rot in the ground.  <br/>Twila has been telling us that she hid these bananas. She  buried them in order to help them ripen and won't tell us where they  are.  <br/>Are you hungry for a banana, little one?  <br/>I'm over the fact that she's saying, "Oh, we're going  to let them rot in the ground." It's so patronizing.  <br/>You're acting like a kid, though. Get over it.  <br/>Why are you being so childish about the damn  bananas?  <br/>She don't want you to have the bananas yet, honey.  <br/>Wearing me slick.  <br/>She's saving those bananas so we all have something to eat  at breakfast each morning.  <br/>I'll just go bury the rest of them and then let you know  if I decide I want to tell you where they are.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Touché. She got you. She got you, Twila. (laughing)  <br/>For Scout, for Twila, for me, it's just gotten to the  point where we cannot hold back anymore and especially Twila. She's just so  childish and immature and so obnoxious and annoying, and I hate the way she  treats me. I hate... I mean, oh, my God.  <br/>It just don't make no sense why she's being so freakin'  childish over it. I don't care. They can stay in the ground and rot, I ain't  digging 'em up now. It's her way or no way. Forget that.  <br/>I'm so sick of Twila. I just want her to go home  now.  <br/>Full moon, Chris.  <br/>Awesome.  <br/>It's like a challenge all over again.  <br/>No kidding.  <br/>It's going to be great. I like watching this.  <br/>Oh, wow.  <br/>Do you see?  <br/>Yeah, that is awesome. So Joe comes back and, you know,  we're like, okay. He goes, "Look, I'm going to take you up here."  So we all three took off up this little trail up the volcano. Watch the  rocks.  <br/>Oh, my God, Chris.  <br/>Oh...  <br/>Oh, my God. Do you believe it?  <br/>This is where we're going to sit and watch.  <br/>No way. Julie, do you see how close we are now?  <br/>I know. Oh, my God. Gosh.  <br/>No way.  <br/>Oh, my...  <br/>It's like a time bomb.  <br/>It is. This is definitely like fireworks.  <br/>It was amazing because every time the volcano erupted, the  volcanic rock would shoot out and it just glowed. It was like the Fourth of  July. Oh, granny, give us a big one.  <br/>Oh... I saw a volcano exploding the whole night. It was  one of the most beautiful things I've ever witnessed.  <br/>There is absolutely no other experience in my life I can  compare it to.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>I don't know if I'll ever have another experience like it.  I mean, how often do you get to sit at the mouth of a volcano and watch it  explode? Is it talking to us or what?  <br/>It's saying good-bye.  <br/>Got me scared. I had to turn around.  <br/>Just about home.  <br/>Oh, I see Chris and Jules coming. (animal call)  <br/>Coming, slowpoke?  <br/>I just filled your water jug, J.B. I don't know where  yours is or I'd fill it for you.  <br/>I knew that. I'm glad, yeah.  <br/>Where's Twila? How is her foot? I've been thinking about  her. After the reward this morning, we come back to camp. Right away, you know,  Scout hugged me and she's thinking the same thing I'm thinking. It's game  time. I just let her know nothing has changed. We're all four together and  then, you know, Twila. She's a basket case. You've got to reassure her.  <br/>Coming back to camp was perfect. Everything fell together.  Everyone's thinking on the same terms, keeping an eye on things. That's what  I got to do.  <br/>Come sit and talk to me for a minute. I was thrilled to  get Julie and Chris back because presumably Julie has spoken to Chris about  voting for Twila. And if Chris is going to go for it, then I might go for it  also.  <br/>Everything is good. Julie picked me for strategy. She's  worried about her spot in the game. She knows that us four have an  alliance.  <br/>Right, right. So if any one of the four of us wins  immunity, we're voting Julie off.  <br/>I don't know. Depends on, you know, our best interest in  the game and how far we can go. I think without a doubt Twila is gonna stick  with Scout, Scout is gonna stick with Twila.  <br/>Oh, yeah, definitely.  <br/>That-that worries me a little bit.  <br/>But if Julie stays in the game, we're automatically in the  final three.  <br/>I'm open-minded to exactly what you said, because, you  know, me and Julie have talked and we had discussed us three...  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>...as being better for all three of us.  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>Yeah. I sat down with Eliza on the beach. We went over a  scenario about me, her and Julie taking out Twila. I mean, I don't trust  Scout. I don't trust Twila. I don't trust Eliza. I don't trust Julie, and  they don't trust each other. And the most screwed-up thing about it is, I  think they all trust me. So... it's... it's getting really crazy. I've  probably made it this way myself because I am playing both sides.  Everything's good. We'll just have to see how this immunity challenge goes,  and, you know, if it falls in the right direction, we'll talk and do what's  best for us... to the final three.  <br/>Oh, yeah. To the final two.  <br/>Well, yeah, I mean, right.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ready for today's  Immunity Challenge?  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>Probst: First things first, Chris. Give it up. Immunity  back up for grabs. For today's immunity challenge, I'm gonna tell you a story  about a legendary man in these parts, and then you're gonna have to answer a  series of questions. Ready for the story?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: All right, back in the 1200s, this guy Chief Roy  Mata comes to this land, conquers it. His first goal was to bring peace by  uniting all of the tribes, and he accomplished that. But sadly, the peace  didn't last very long. 15 years later, Roy Mata was murdered, not by an enemy  or a rival chief, but by his own brother. Now, it certainly wasn't forbidden  to bury a chief on the land that he ruled, but the locals were so afraid of  the power of the spirit of Roy Mata that they took the body to a remote  location and they buried him there with his 18 assistant chiefs, their wives  and all of Roy Mata's wives. Before being buried alive, the men were given a  strong brew of kava, not because it was customary but because it put them in  a dream-like relaxed state. The women, however, were strangled to death before  being buried. Once the ceremony was complete, the land was declared taboo,  and nobody visited for seven centuries. One footnote, the name Roy Mata, not  a popular name today. In fact, it has never been used since. That is your  story. Your challenge now to see how much of that information you've  retained. Here's how it'll work. There are six huts scattered in the jungle.  You'll race to a hut where you'll find a puzzle. Put the puzzle together,  which has the question, read it and then choose between answer A or answer B.  Attached to each answer is a bag full of tusks. Without looking, reach in and  pull one out. If you're wrong, you will grab a black tusk, in which case you  have to race back to the center, toss it in the urn and return to the hut to  answer the question correctly. If you're right, you'll grab a white tusk,  bring that back to your post, put it on your necklace. There are six huts.  First person to get five answers correctly wins immunity. Ready to do  this?  <br/>Let's roll.  <br/>Probst: Here we go. For immunity and a guaranteed spot in  the final four. Survivors ready. Go!  <br/>Okay. "When Roy Mata conquered the land, what was his  first goal?" "Unite the tribes."  <br/>Probst: Eliza heads back first. She's got one right.  <br/>"The body of Roy Mata was not buried on his  homeland..." Because... "It was forbidden by custom."  "Locals feared his spirit."  <br/>Probst: Chris back. He's got one right.  <br/>"Roy Mata was poisoned by..." "A  family..."  <br/>Probst: Here's Julie. She's got one right. Eliza, Chris,  Julie with one right.  <br/>"Before being buried alive, the men drank kava  because..." "It was customary."  <br/>Probst: Twila has her first one right.  <br/>"The wives of the assistant chiefs serving under Roy  Mata were also buried alive."  <br/>Probst: Scout got it wrong, throws it in the urn.  <br/>"To this date, the name Roy Mata is..."  "Never used." "A popular name." "Never  used."  <br/>Probst: Eliza heading back with her second question. Eliza  in the lead with two. Here's Julie back with another one. Chris back with his  second one. Eliza extends her lead. Back with her third correct answer. Julie  racing back. She's got her third. Looking for an opening hut. Chris trying to  get in this. Eliza with three, Julie with three, Chris with two. Eliza got her  fourth one right. Julie right behind her. She has her fourth one. We're dead  even. Between Eliza and Julie. Julie waiting on a spot from Twila. Eliza with  four, Julie with four. First one back with the white tusk wins immunity,  guaranteed spot in the final four.  <br/>"Before being buried alive, the men drank kava  because..." "It relaxed them." "It was customary."  "It relaxed them."  <br/>Probst: Here comes Eliza, number five, and with that,  Eliza wins immunity! All right, Eliza. Get over here.  <br/>My first time.  <br/>Probst: Well, it's a good time to be the first time. So  the other four of you, after 36 days of making it this far, tonight the game  will end for one of you. I'll see you tonight at Tribal Council. Head on back  to camp. (indistinct conversation)  <br/>For the first time, I won individual immunity today, and I  am guaranteed a spot in the final four. It's awesome. It's a great feeling.  I'd like to win every immunity challenge from here on out. This is gonna be  the first Tribal Council I haven't brought my bag to. I think that tonight  Chris, Julie and I are going to shock the hell out of everyone and vote off  Twila, and it's just... it's a really exciting prospect. Chris has proved me  right so far, and I just hope he continues to do so.  <br/>(indistinct talking)  <br/>Yeah. Not a big deal.  <br/>What are they talking about?  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>Putting a lot of trust in Chris, you know? He could  guarantee himself a final-three spot with them.  <br/>But... I don't think he'll do that.  <br/>We're three, they're two. That's it. Case closed, right,  Scout?  <br/>Right, absolutely.  <br/>Nothing stops us.  <br/>If I'm going home, you'd better tell me.  <br/>You guys... I'm here because of you guys. It's not  changing. I mean, don't even doubt it. I would tell you, you got it? We're  going all the way, to the final three.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Scout and Twila are definitely convinced that Julie's the  next to go. And then there's me. I'm still weighing my options, but I'm going  back and forth like a teeter-totter, you know? I'm thinking, one moment I  think I'm gonna keep Julie around, and the next moment, you know, I'm thinking  maybe I better stick with Twila and Scout. Now, just listen to me. It's just  a question. It's not what's gonna happen necessarily. If I decide to vote  Julie off tonight because I think it's best for me and you, that doesn't  affect me and your pact, right?  <br/>The only thing is, you know Scout and Twila are not gonna  go against each other. That means whichever one of us doesn't win immunity is  going up against one of them, whichever one we decide to vote off first, in a  challenge at Tribal Council.  <br/>I know.  <br/>That's what that means. And so yes, it doesn't affect our  pact, but that means that one of the two of us could end up in the final  three with two of them, meaning 100% we do not end up in the final two.  <br/>I know, I know.  <br/>What's up?  <br/>I don't know, you tell me. What's up, Eliza?  <br/>I don't know. I just feel like you're ... with me.  <br/>You got immunity.  <br/>You're right, I do have immunity tonight, but if I don't  have immunity tomorrow night, then who's gone, T? I think you're a liar,  T.  <br/>Who else has been lying? Are you in this alliance with us  to the end?  <br/>I hadn't told a lie in this game.  <br/>And have you been talking to Julie about anything, or is  that just... that's okay for you to do? You said, swore to us that you was in  this final-four alliance till the end, so what've you been talking to Julie  about?  <br/>Hey, I'm gonna listen to her.  <br/>And you're not saying, "Okay, we would like to do  this and this and get Twila and Scout out of here" or anything?  <br/>I'm listening. I'm listening, and you know what?  <br/>And you ain't said a word?  <br/>I would consider it, because you've been trying to plot  against me since day one.  <br/>You've been on the edge for the last three friggin' days.  You're driving everybody friggin' nuts. Chill out. You got one night that you  know you ain't going nowhere. Enjoy it.  <br/>I will.  <br/>Now, Chris, what are you thinking?  <br/>(laughs): What? I'm just laying here, you know, in the  hammock.  <br/>No, you was talking to... I just come up. I was just kind  of listening to what was being said.  <br/>I'm hearing Eliza out. She's talking to me.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Everybody's scrambling. I just think I'm in a better  position than, you know, Twila, Scout, Eliza, or Julie right now because  I'm-I'm, I'm pretty much the middle man, as far as I know. You know, what  them four have conspired or talked about, I don't know. I don't trust any of  them. They're thick as thieves, man. They're all women. How do you trust any  of them? So, I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm messing with both sides,  but it's kind of easy to do right now. I need to do it to figure out what my  best option is right now. It's probably in my best interest to go with you  and Eliza because Scout and Twila are too thick. I haven't broke my word that  often in this game and I thought I would be a cutthroat piece of...  <br/>But isn't she easier to do that to than me?  <br/>What I'm comparing this to is my friendship with you  compared to my friendship with Twila.  <br/>Right.  <br/>And my friendship with you is a hell of a lot more than  my-- I mean, come on. We've joked around, and, you know, I call you my little  sister. It's just... it's totally different. We'll keep you. We're gonna vote  off Twila.  <br/>Chris approaches me. He says he's gonna straight-out vote  for Twila, basically saying that our friendship is weighing on his decision  tonight. I hope he keeps me around. That's all I can do. I don't know for  sure. I'm not going to be extremely paranoid. I'm just really gonna be even  keel and hope that it goes in my favor.  <br/>I haven't liked the game since we merged.  <br/>We have no reason to be stressed. I've made my decision.  It's not gonna change. It's me, you, and Scout voting for Julie, and that's  it. That's not gonna change. I'm not even hesitating. Me and Julie's become  friends. I'm sending her home tonight.  <br/>Chris has guaranteed me that I'm not going home tonight.  Part of me wants to believe Chris wholeheartedly, but-- it's a game. I just  cannot do it. I cannot let my guard down. You can't trust nobody now. Nobody.  You're playing for a million dollars. People have murdered for less than a  million dollars, you know? Come on.  <br/>I'm excited to have immunity.  <br/>I know, you ought to be.  <br/>I told Julie that I'm keeping her. I told Twila that I'm  keeping her. I'm gonna put myself in the best possible situation to win the  game. It's tough right now. I'm gonna have to make a decision before  long.  <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of the jury: Sarge,  Chad, Leanne, and Ami-- voted out at the last Tribal Council. Welcome to  Tribal Council. Well, let talk about 36 days, a lot of wear and tear,  physically and certainly emotionally. Everybody here wants to win the game.  Have you guys started thinking about who deserves to win this game? Twila, is  there any way that somebody could be unworthy of winning?  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>Be honest.  <br/>Probst: You don't know or you don't want to say?  <br/>You are being hard on me, you know that?  <br/>Probst: Am I?  <br/>Yes, sir, you are.  <br/>Probst: Are you saying there are people here tonight that  absolutely do not deserve to be in the final five.  <br/>Just tell him what you feel, Twila.  <br/>Yeah, come on.  <br/>Why hold back now?  <br/>My personal opinion is yes, there is.  <br/>It's me, by the way, in case anybody was wondering.  <br/>Probst: Well, Twila, it's no secret you and Eliza have not  gotten along for a long time.  <br/>No. No, there's no secret.  <br/>Probst: Eliza, anybody here that doesn't deserve to be  here.  <br/>Even though they would say the opposite of me, I think all  the people sitting here deserve to be here. That doesn't mean that I like  them. That doesn't mean that I don't like other people, who are no longer in  the game, a million times more than I like some of the people sitting here  next to me, but I think we all deserve to be here. We wouldn't be here  otherwise.  <br/>Probst: What about you, Julie? At this point, when you  have to vote, obviously, it's strategic, but is there any part of you  starting to whittle things down, thinking who I want to go to the final four  with are these people and this is why?  <br/>Um... I guess, just judging people. The longer you're with  them, you see their antics and tactics and I feel like I can, I know who I  can trust and who I can't trust and who cares about me or who doesn't care  about me.  <br/>Probst: At this point, do you think any of these other  four care about you?  <br/>Yeah, I know that some do.  <br/>Probst: Chris, what's tough for you about tonight's  vote?  <br/>Toughest vote yet.  <br/>Probst: For you?  <br/>Oh, yeah.  <br/>Probst: Why?  <br/>Uh... kind of caught in the middle. It's a vote I don't  even want to cast, but I, you know, I've got to play the game.  <br/>Probst: All right. Eliza, you have immunity. As always,  you can keep it or assign it to somebody else.  <br/>I think I better hold on to it, Jeff.  <br/>Oh, give it to Twila.  <br/>It's my first time.  <br/>Probst: Okay, you cannot vote for Eliza. Everybody else is  fair game. It is time to vote. Scout, you're up.  <br/>Jules, a wise woman once gave me some good information:  "Go back to your roots, Jules. Rediscover your roots."  <br/>Twila, I have been waiting to vote you off since the day I  met you. I cannot believe that 36 days later, I'm finally getting this  opportunity.  <br/>It's tough, but I gotta play the game.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes.  <br/>Probst: Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The  person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.  I'll read the votes. First vote... Julie. Twila. One vote Julie, one vote  Twila. Julie. Two votes Julie, one vote Twila. Twila. Two votes Twila, two  votes Julie. I'll read the last vote. The 14th person voted out of Survivor:  Vanuatu... Julie. You need to bring me your torch. Julie, the tribe has  spoken. Well, you have made it to the final four. Over the next three days,  there will be three Tribal Councils, two immunity challenges, one winner.  Grab your torches and head back to camp. Good night.  <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.  <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:  <br/>I don't think you deserve to be here, Eliza. You have done  nothing but boil freakin' water.  <br/>I think Twila's a dumb bitch.  <br/>Probst: The heat is on.  <br/>I hope they kill each other.  <br/>Probst: Only three days are left. Next time, in a two-hour  special, find out who will become the sole survivor.  <br/>It's for a million bucks. That'll change your life.  <br/>Here I am. It's day 36, I'm done. Little bit of a  surprise. You know, I-I thought Chris and I had this kind of straightforward  brother-sister kind of slap-each-other-around relationship, and Chris was  kind of my crutch today and he told me 100% that he was gonna vote for Twila.  I don't know if he changed the last minute. I'm curious.
