<br/>Probst: Tom leading. <br/>All right here we go! Pick it up! <br/>Probst: Tom wins first individual immunity. Tom's got it! <br/>I hit him with a machete. <br/>Oh my God! <br/>Wham! He keeps whomping me. You know you can only taunt me so long before I strike back at  you. <br/>The difference between Tom is he's a man. Tom is he's a man. He's a man among men. He's a man among men. <br/>Probst: Welcome back to the Survivor: Palau Reunion Show. For the first time, we have all 20 of this season's survivors  back together. Great season. Going to cover as much as we can, starting with Tom. Congratulations. Thank you, Jeff. [ cheering and applause ] Thank you. And all of you, thank you. <br/>Probst: And, obviously, this is your hometown. You've got a lot of crowd support out there. <br/>Yeah, New York! Whoo! Oh, yeah! [ cheering and applause ]  Probst: And I got to say, Tom, you know, well deserved. It was a season that there was a lot of domination. Your tribe, Koror, dominated. You guys won 11 of 14 challenges, a Survivorrecord, and you won  five of seven individual challenges, also another record. So you cannot say you don't deserve this, you didn't play it  well. What was the plan going in? 'Cause you had a very clear strategy of how to get here. <br/>You know, actually, the way that this played out, I owe to  a good friend of mine, and my wife, most importantly, who, when I started  concocting plans of the role I would play out there in Palau, and they both  just slapped me around and said, you've got to go in there and be yourself,  it's a winning strategy. I thought I was going to be able to hide underneath my gray  hair, and, uh, you know, it didn't happen too well. So I kind of, if anything, I played a lousy strategy game 'cause  I didn't hide well. So, it all just had...  Probst: This...  to play it all out. <br/>Probst: This is why you won, right there. That answer of saying nothing, but just... continually not  offending anybody. [ laughter ] But, obviously, the two people next to you-- key:  The relationship with Katie and Ian formed at the beginning? <br/>First night. <br/>Probst: Very unusual to see an alliance make it that long. <br/>Right. <br/>Probst: And, Katie, let's address the fact you took a lot  of heat in that final Tribal Council. <br/>You think? [ laughter ]  Probst: And... Gregg. Where's Gregg? This is what I want to know. She made a good point of saying, look, I'm not the most  physically gifted, but my strategy was to find two people strong and attach  myself to them. Why was there so much animosity? <br/>You know, it's... there was, and it's unfortunate, because...  when I was on the other side, outside of the game, I looked at these people  as characters, and I didn't take into account the personal relationships that  I had. And I can tell you that Katie, for 33 days, for me, she did  entertain me, she was my friend, and she articulated her strategy very well. And, I mean, I love her, and I love our friendship. And for some reason, she was just a character over there, and I  laid into her, and I feel horrible about it. <br/>Probst: Well, and you also said something to me before the  show that as far as you were concerned, the game wasn't over. And you wanted them to earn this vote. <br/>This game is about being accountable for your actions. And I do believe, in the context of the game, that you need  to... you need to pay the price to keep the game pure. And you need to put people in the hot seat, and I can tell you  that as soon as I asked my question, you know, to Katie, I lost focus. I didn't know what was going on. But as soon as we cast our votes I went over and I gave both of  them a hug and a kiss, and I said, "Great game." You know,  "This is what it's... this is what it's about." That was my last  move. But, you know, my last move was that question. But the hug and kiss was where it mattered. <br/>Probst: Katie... you seemed completely surprised by the  animosity towards you, which surprised me, knowing what I saw, even at Tribal  Council, there were a few people you should have... you could have naturally  assumed were not going to like you, based on what you said about them and  making... Janu comes to mind, you know, first. So why were you so surprised that there were going to be some  people frustrated with you? <br/>Well, I wasn't surprised by Janu-- I went in knowing I  wasn't, probably, going to answer her question. Um...  Probst: That's another thing, while we're on it. You make it all the way... you make it all the way to day 39. There are seven votes. It takes four to win, and you gave one up. You just gave it up. <br/>I didn't give it up. I mean, I knew going in, there was... How many times did I say,  "I will not win against Tom"? I tried to take him out. I love him, but come on. You can't beat this guy. <br/>Probst: Janu, was your mind made up? <br/>It was, Jeff. <br/>Probst: It was. All right. [ laughter ]  Sorry. [ applause ]  Probst: Tom, I thought there was an interesting thing  going on between you and Gregg-- to show you how quickly the game can flip. You guys both approached this with a lot of game theory-- that  is, trying to figure out what the other person's best move is and making your  move based on that. Gregg, that was the case with you, right? <br/>That was all my prep, yep. <br/>Probst: You said you would sit up at night and think about  everybody and what they were going to do. <br/>I would go through, you know, the line that we were  sleeping in-- "Okay, what's Caryn's best move right now? What's she thinking? What is she going to do?" And try to make my move subtly by  making... assuming everyone else is playing logical and gonna make the smart  move. <br/>Probst: And your plan was to get to five and make your  move. <br/>That's right, worked well. <br/>Probst: Tom figured... [ laughter ] Well, you know what? Tom was telling me-- you figured it out-- that based on what you  knew about Gregg, why he wouldn't do that. Tell me about that. <br/>Um, you know, Gregg really believes when you're on a plan,  you stick with that plan, and nothing derides the cart. And it's that good analytical thinking that makes him great in  business. He finds out what's wrong with a company and where you have to  streamline it. He had a really good firm he was working for, Koror  Incorporated, and he didn't want the partners unhappy. And he just said, "Let's go, I've got time. I've got time," so I believed he was going to stay with it  right to the five. I was told later, "No, no, no, he's coming for you,"  so... but I believed that he would stay with it just based on the fact that,  um, he liked the way things were going, he knew that...  Probst: So to be clear, you figured out, "He's going  to wait till five. I get him at six."  I was told that he was coming for me. I would've waited to five, and then, and still played... I was  going to hold to that word also and just say, "All right, we'll play to  five, and then we'll start the picking off."  Probst: This is complicated for me, and I've already  talked to you guys about this stuff, and now I feel like I'm getting played. Caryn, talking about making the best move, if you make it to  this game-- this is my opinion, obviously, I've never played it-- but if you  make it to five, without any alliances, suddenly, you become the most  valuable person on the island. There are two here and two here, and you in the middle. What happened? How did you go home that night? Why weren't you guaranteed a spot in the final three? <br/>Well, I'm not sure exactly what happened, because I wasn't  privy to everything that happened, but when I wouldn't give up information on  the beach that Jenn and Katie and I had made an alliance, I think I ticked  off Tom and Ian. I mean, Tom and Ian were definitely considering-- at least I  thought, I could be wrong-- taking me and getting rid of Jenn next, but I  think when I didn't give up any information that it didn't work. You know, I wasn't useful to them anymore. And then Katie flip-flopped on the all-women alliance, and so I  wasn't useful there for them, either, so I went home, I went packing. <br/>Probst: Ian? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Probst: You're 11 hours into a challenge. You find yourself final three with your two allies and the two  people you have betrayed, so severely, you don't know what to do. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: 11 hours, almost-- yeah, it was 11 hours-- longest  challenge we've ever had, you finally decide to step down. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Now some will say, "Hmm, it's a little  suspect." Were you really processing the whole time? <br/>Absolutely-- I mean, there wasn't too much else to do,  unfortunately. I mean, you're on a buoy, and, uh... a lot had happened in the  past 24 hours, and, you know, I came into the game wanting to play, you know,  from where I'm from and with the values that I came to the game with, and I  realized at the 11th hour-- I guess, literally, this time-- that I hadn't  been doing that. And I wasn't ready to sacrifice, you know, what I was going to  take back to my family and my friends back home for a million bucks,  so...  Probst: And no regrets on that? [ applause and cheering ]  Absolutely not, no. <br/>Probst: Interesting stat, as, uh, as we go to break on  this segment, seven of the ten winners have been 30 years or older. The average age is 34 of winning this game, and it brings up an  interesting topic, which is maturity, because everybody else was playing this  game, too. Maybe they were playing it better, but it seemed like you just  grew up a little bit out there. <br/>Absolutely, I mean the game changed my life. And I had the opportunity to play with somebody almost three  times my age, so... [ laughter ] So it was, uh, I learned a lot from the  people that I played with, so...  Probst: On that note, up next, we will hear from  Survivor'sfavorite hairdresser Coby. Still to come, on of the most popular survivors ever, Stephenie,  but first, this season's challenges were some of the most physical ever. of the most physical ever. Take a look. Take a look. <br/>Come on, we got to go! <br/>Come on! <br/>Probst: Angie dunks Gregg! Gregg dunking Bobby Jon. Ooh! Still on! Steph! <br/>Swallow it, Bobby Jon. <br/>We're not going back to Tribal Council! to Tribal Council! [ all cheering ] [ all cheering ] [ screams ]  Oh, my God! There were three! There were three! [ gasps ] [ gasps ] [ applause and cheering ] [ applause and  cheering ]  Aw, how cute. <br/>Aw, how cute. <br/>Probst: Well, Survivor: Palau had some big characters,  some big challenges and some big twists. We also had some very big revelations. We've already talked about Ian's realization regarding  integrity. Another great story this season was Coby-- what he proved to  others, what he proved to himself. You like this pressure, don't you? [ all cheering ] Coby does it. <br/>As a kid, I was always called the girlie-guy, you know, as  a sissy. People would pick on me, and I would just give up. I ended up quitting school because people made fun of me. <br/>Probst: James comes on strong out of the gate. Coby fighting back. <br/>Coby, go! <br/>But I wasn't going to let anybody make me quit this time,  no matter how hard it is. <br/>Probst: And he's got him! James is in! [ cheering ] [ applause and cheering ]  Probst: Aw, Coby. What... was that part of the appeal? Did you come out here to try to get rid of some demons? <br/>I did-- my demons were, when I was a kid, you know, I  wasn't popular in school, so Survivor really is kind of like high school, so  I wanted to be popular, you know? I wanted to be the prom queen, but... but I'm not. And to be part of a team was definitely an appeal. <br/>Probst: To be part of a team? <br/>A team-- 'cause I'd never been part of a team, you know...  That's why this was such a nightmare, because it started off as my childhood  nightmare with the pick 'em. It was awful, it was awful to watch that happen. <br/>Probst: And so you ended up being part of the most  dominating team in the history of this show. <br/>Yeah! Sorry, Bobby Jon. [ laughter ]  Probst: And so are you different? Did you go home and have some skeletons gone? <br/>I did that day. When they showed me crying, that day, I completely put it all to  rest. I really did. It was the best moment of my life, one of them. <br/>Probst: Wow! [ applause and cheering ] Well, one of the... I know one of the  favorite moments for me was a great showdown: Coby, the gay hairdresser  versus James, the self-proclaimed redneck from Alabama. <br/>Come on! Come on. <br/>Probst: And you know what was great about that was that...  was that you beat James, and James was so... You were so complimentary about  it. I mean, you really were. And I have to imagine the next day after that episode aired,  when you went in to work, your buddies had a couple of things to say. This is America-- am I wrong, or not? <br/>This is America, and to be honest with you, I've been  unemployed... [ laughter ] 'cause I can't get work because I'm a  redneck...  Probst: James...  but I'll tell you what. Folks I've been around... yeah, my old friends from the mill,  you know, they saw it, and I'll tell you what, I tell them straight up,  "That boy whooped my tail." He's 210 pounds, 155. That ain't no excuse, because I was pure steel from the steel  mill, you know? And I thought I was going to whoop Coby. You know, I'm thinking in my head, "This is a gay  hairdresser, he's feminine. I'm going to whoop his tail-- I'm a steel mill worker."  That boy, he's got some tail, I'm telling you. Wore me out. [ applause and cheering ] I respect that. <br/>Thank you, James. <br/>Probst: And, James, you know, you were a big character out  there, and I don't want to take a long time on this, but you said something  interesting to me, which was you actually changed, too. You said you don't take your kids for granted anymore. <br/>Oh, Lord, no. It changed me. You know, me and my family-- rocky-- but when I got back, a lot  of things changed. I went and did with my kids, I went and roasted hot dogs and  marshmallows, first thing I did, and I don't take my wife for granted no  more, neither. <br/>Probst: Good. <br/>It changed me. [ applause ]  Probst: Another revelation this season, showgirl, was  Janu, who... you know, this was more than you bargained for. It seemed to be. And you had some tough days, disappointing at challenges, laid  around camp a lot-- even you would agree with that-- and then your worst  nightmare comes true: you get thrown on an island by yourself, and it turns  into be the biggest moment of your life. <br/>It was great. It was amazing to be there by myself. It was supposed to be "exile island," and it just came  together for me. It was full circle. And I learned the appreciation that I had for family and friends  and life in general was just that. I was satisfied. And I knew, going in to Tribal. <br/>Probst: And I want to-- this is something I haven't asked  you, haven't asked anybody else who was at Tribal Council that night. Yes or no, did I coerce you into quitting? <br/>No, you did not. <br/>Probst: Anybody at Tribal Council that night feel that I  did, who was there? No. I couldn't have convinced anybody else to quit. 'Cause the point I'm getting at is, you know, when somebody-- if  you come into this game thinking you can quit, you probably will quit, and if  you come to Tribal Council looking to quit, you're probably gonna quit. 'Cause if I smell it, I'm going to find it, 'cause every time  somebody quits, there's 50,000 people at home going, "I wouldn't have  quit." So I just wanted to get that out there because there's another form  of quit that we're going to talk about now which is the engineered quit. And I'm looking at you, Jeff. <br/>I knew it was coming. I was waiting for it. I'm, like, "Bring it on."  Probst: Because there's another way to get out of this  game and that is to say, "Vote me out." And it may not always play  as a quit, but in my world it's kind of a quit. And I want to hear you defend why you should have left the game  with a hurt ankle when you clearly could have chopped coconuts, made fire,  tended camp in a lot of different ways. <br/>Well, I mean, first of all, I am officially "Coconut  Boy." I mean, anywhere I go, anybody that talks to me, I'm "Coconut  Boy." That's how it goes, I mean... It can't get any worse than that. <br/>That's hot. <br/>But, for me, it really did come down to I knew my  strength. I knew my limits, and, at that point, I had already injured  myself to the point where I knew that was it. It wasn't going to go further. <br/>Probst: Okay, what I'm asking, Bobby Jon saw you, he walks  by-- there's a great moment in the show when he sees you chopping coconuts  and says, "Kim is not doing anything. Jeff is at least contributing to camp." Bobby Jon, would  you have left the game with an injured ankle? <br/>Uh, you'd've had to cut my head off and carry it in a  five-gallon bucket... [ loud applause and laughter ] ...'cause I wouldn't  have left; I wouldn't have left. But, you sometimes, you can't help it, though. When you get hurt, I mean, you're injured, and he just had  surgery on it. So I know he was really hurt. <br/>Probst: I'm not debating you were hurt, don't get me  wrong. I'm just wanting you to defend it. <br/>I've defended this a lot, Jeff. <br/>Probst: And you know, Ashlee on one side of you, and Kim  on the other, we could possibly make the same argument for you guys. Ashlee, would you agree with that? That, in some ways, you kind of had enough of that game. <br/>Jeff, I completely had enough of it, yeah. Unfortunately for me, I thought that I was tough, but, no. Not tough enough to last. <br/>Probst: All right. And on the end, two people who never had a chance to quit,  Jonathan and Wanda, because you didn't get picked. Jonathan, you're a more unlikely target for that. I mean, I think people look at you, you're a strong guy, you're  young, you're fit. What happened? <br/>I jumped out of the boat. And, I guess, swimming against that current didn't really pan  out. You know, I thought I was going to swim twice as fast as the  boat, get to shore, get immunity-- and it just kind of all fell apart from  there, I guess. <br/>Probst: So, that's the reason you didn't get picked is...? <br/>I mean, honestly...  Probst: Angie, you're waving your arms. <br/>Um, no, I don't think that's just it. Like, I knew this question was going to come up, and you seem  like a very nice person now, but when we were out there, I think you gave me  one conversation, and I think the conversation you gave me wasn't very nice. And I think maybe that happened to a few other people, and the  fact was, you're very nice in person, but I think when we were out there, you  weren't. I think you kind of picked and choosed who you talked to, and  you made a little bit of enemies that way. It wasn't just about... 'Cause I never looked at it like that. <br/>Yeah, but 20 people going all in different directions,  right when we get to the beach, that's kind of hard for, you know, to form a  relationship with everybody in three days. <br/>Probst: All right, all right, all right, we're not going  to play it out. But obviously, there's a little dissension, and first  impressions matter in this game. Obviously, Wanda, you were the other one on that end of the  stick. And your attitude seems to be, you're okay with it. I mean, you went off singing. Was that true or were you hurt? <br/>It was devastating, absolutely devastating, but they  called out, "Sing us another song, Wanda." There was some pleasure  in it, even though they had a couple of curmudgeons who managed to complain  about it. And so they asked for a song. I never let my fans down. [ cheering and applause ]  Probst: Okay, I gotta ask, Wanda... I have to ask. I'm guessing you prepared a song for...  You betcha. <br/>Probst: I hope it's short. Go for it. [ to melody of "Oh, Susanna"]: We were stranded on  Palauan shores With coconuts and rats We survived the heat, found some food  to eat And some survived the spats We're survivors, we faced and passed the  test And in history, all the world will see That Survivor Ten was best. Probst: No, you're done. [ cheering, whistling ] All right, thank you, Wanda. She was the first person off the boat and the last remaining  Ulong member. One of the most popular women ever to play this game. ever to play this game. Stephenie is next! Stephenie is next! <br/>Probst: Stephenie, the only woman left in this challenge. <br/>I've been an athlete my entire life. I'm just not a good loser. <br/>Probst: Steph does it again! <br/>She can do anything a man can do, I tell you that. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>Probst: Good old-fashioned cat fight. Steph not budging, and pushes Jenn off easily. <br/>This is the scariest thing and the hardest thing that I'll  ever do. But I'll never give up. I'm not a quitter. One coconut. It's a big one, at least. [ sighs ] [ sighs ] [ applause and cheering ] [ applause and  cheering ]  Probst: Steph, nobody ever in that situation before-- one  tribe member left, spending the night out on your own. Did you know going in that you had that in you? I mean, you're an athlete. Obviously, you've been in a lot of competition, but that was  severe circumstances. <br/>Yeah, yeah it was. Um... [ clears throat ] I knew I'd be all right in the  challenges to a certain extent. I didn't know how I would fare with no food, and then losing  every single immunity challenge was like really... No, it's not your fault. Um, that was really, really tough. So, no, I mean, I didn't know. I had no idea I was, you know, gonna be able to do that well. <br/>Probst: Was there a defining moment, when you think back  on your time out there, where you, where it all crystallized, and you knew  you were all right? <br/>It was probably that night when I was by myself. It's like, can't get any worse than this. I'm the last one left. I mean, there's nothing... You know, I'm here by myself. I don't know what's going to happen. And then I got to join Koror. Then I was, like, forget it, I can do anything now. <br/>Probst: What's been the reaction on the street from  people? Because you're one of the most popular women, certainly, to ever  play Survivor. ever play Survivor. [ cheering ] [ cheering ]  I don't know. It's weird, you know. I'm so grateful that everybody's been so supportive. Thank you, everybody. [ scattered applause ] Um... it's just, everywhere I go, people,  you know, come up to me and they say, you know, "You're my daughter's  hero. You're my hero." Just a nice thing to hear, I guess. I get a lot of letters; lot of really nice letters from high  school women, even men. So I don't know. I don't know. <br/>Probst: Yeah, go figure. Uh, Bobby Jon, your partner... for some reason, even though,  watching the Ulong tribe dwindle, it was kind of fun toward the end, because  you'd never seen it happen. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Probst: I'll admit. When it got to Bobby Jon and Steph, it just seemed different. It seemed like it really was this tribe of two, and suddenly, we  certainly realized, "Wow, this has never happened before." Bobby  Jon, you never got voted out. <br/>Didn't get voted out. That's right...  Probst: You only are out of this game because we had a  tiebreaker, somebody had to go home. <br/>That's right. I got beat. Didn't get voted off. Still feels good, but you still lose. And I wear my winning hat like a man, I wear my losing hat like  a man. <br/>Probst: So, no sour grapes? <br/>No, not a bit. <br/>Probst: Hey, where does your work ethic come from? Because, if Stephenie's one of the most popular women, it's fair  to say you're one of the hardest-working people that has ever been out there. You never slacked off. And that doesn't seem like a strategy. That just seems like Bobby Jon. <br/>That's me; I would have to definitely give credit to my  family and the people of Troy, Alabama. That's all they know how to do is work. When you go there, you work. And I was brought up good. [ applause ]  Probst: One other, one other question I have for you. You got to experience something that was so spectacular--  Jellyfish Lake. Did it last? Did it stay with you? Is that a moment you can go back on and remember? <br/>If you go back in the Rolodex in your brain, that's the  one I go back to is Jellyfish Lake. Because, for me, that was peace. Not many times people can go and find peace like that. And for me it just, it was really just complete peace. <br/>Probst: Jolanda, first person to win immunity and be the  first person voted out. <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: And you're obviously strong and a competitor. What happened out there? <br/>I think a lot of things happened. The way that we had to choose tribes sort of threw off the  dynamic, because I thought I'd get to pick a team, but I didn't. I got to pick one, and I ended up being on a team full of young  adults. And anyone who's a parent knows that when they start turning 18,  21, 25, 30, you want to prove to the world that you know everything, and they  didn't want leadership, and they didn't want to be a team, and we were  duplicating effort. And I knew, when I got voted off, that we were going to  self-extinct, and I knew it. I wanted them to do better, but, I mean, when I go back to when  I was those ages, I didn't listen, either, so...  Probst: Angie, why... Is she right? Why was Ulong so unsuccessful? <br/>She is right about not listening. Nobody... I mean, we'd go to challenges and we weren't  listening. We'd talk to each other and we weren't listening. And it's, it's one of those things, like, you see the other  tribe getting together so well 'cause they'd listen more to one another. And it was, it's kind of sad, like...  Something about our team, is we totally-- the young people  did-- underestimated Koror. <br/>We had great ideas. <br/>They're old, they can't do anything. And I kept saying, dude, we're not old. We think. We can't run as fast, we can't jump as high, but we think. And then we make a plan. And it was, like, "No, we got all the muscles. We're young."  Oh, I didn't believe that. <br/>Probst: Ibrehem, you told me that you changed your game  plan because Jolanda was first out. And you thought, "You know what? Being strong ain't a good idea."  Well, I don't think her being strong was the problem. I thought that was something good that we needed. But I think people couldn't handle her strong personality. And I guess I didn't want to jump out there and do the same  thing and get me out of the game quick. <br/>We got put on a cursed island. <br/>Probst: Yeah, yeah, blame it on the island. All right, up next, couples updates from Jeff and Kim and Gregg  and Jenn. That should be interesting. Plus for one survivor, the experience in Palau led to a dramatic  life change, and we will share that with you. But first, take a look at these record number of events that had  never happened before-- that had never happened before-- Survivorfirsts. Survivorfirsts. <br/>Probst: Tough to say, but guys, it is time for you to go. <br/>We couldn't believe that we were going back to Tribal  Council. This has to be a record. <br/>It was exciting being the last Ulong member. At the same time, it was really scary. <br/>"Ulong has been conquered and one more now joins  Koror."  Probst: We have a tie. We're tied. We're tied. Ian, we're still tied. <br/>If I don't step down, I'm gonna beat you. <br/>That's why I won't step down. <br/>Probst: Who are you voting out of this game? <br/>I'm going to vote out  I'm going to vote out my buddy Ian. my buddy Ian. [ band playing ] [ band playing ] [ applause and cheering ] [  applause and cheering ]  Probst: By the way, all the music you hear every week, on  every episode of Survivor is those guys right there: Russ Landau, David  Vanacore-- great musicians and composers. [ applause and whistling ] Okay, Jenn, give me the update. You and Gregg were a couple on the island. Are you a couple now? <br/>We were on the island. We had a... a good alliance; we had a good bond, and it was a  good friendship, too, and we're still continuing to be friends, and let the  dust settle after this whole thing and see what happens. <br/>Probst: All right. Kim, Jeff, same thing. You guys posed in a magazine. Are you a couple now, are you friends? What, Kim? <br/>We are amazing friends. Um, I actually live out in California now, and we get the chance  to hang out and have fun, and a great time on the island. I'm just glad to have him in my life as a friend. <br/>Probst: Nice! Hey, one other thing, I'll put, Willard, with you, that didn't  make the show that I thought was really interesting-- you're an attorney, but  you didn't tell people that. You told them...  I told them I was a mailman, and I'd actually been a  mailman, a long time ago, when I was an undergraduate. But my theory was-- you take a random selection of Americans, a  significant portion of them know lawyer jokes, dislike lawyers. Nobody dislikes the mailman. <br/>Probst: And they all bought it. You guys didn't know. [ all murmuring ]  Willard told me. <br/>I told Caryn, but Caryn was a lawyer, too. We could smell each other out like sharks... [ laughter ]  That's exactly right. Probst: One other thing we have to share, very big surprise  with, I think, everybody here, except for one person, and that person is  Coby. You came back home-- big life change. Tell us about it. <br/>Well, everybody keeps saying family and how important family  is. And one of the other things that Survivordid for me was it  helped me put away a lot of the guilt about being a gay man in society and  that I can't have my own family. So, when I got back, I started looking into adoption. And I was looking at international adoption, and my cousin was  actually brave enough to call me, and odd enough, she was pregnant and  couldn't keep it. So I actually adopted a little girl. [ applause, cheering and whistling ]  So awesome. <br/>And, and...  Probst: One more part to this story. <br/>Close... I named her Janu. [ all sighing ]  That's sweet, man. <br/>Oh, my God. [ indistinct chatter ] [ applause and whistling ]  Probst: On that note, where is Survivorgoing next? More stories to come. We'll tell you, right after this. [ band playing ] [ band playing ] [ applause and cheering ] [  applause and cheering ] [ band playing, applause, cheering and whistling  ]  Probst: Tomorrow morning, on The EarlyShow, here on CBS,  Tom will get a check for a million bucks. [ applause and cheering ] And along with that, you get something  else, which is a 2005 Chevy SSR. You guys saw it out on the island. Nice little rig, and, uh, I have the keys right here. <br/>Nice. <br/>Cool. <br/>Probst: Good hands. There you are. [ applause and cheering ]  That's too cool. Well, as Survivor: Palau comes to a close, there is a brand-new  batch of newbies waiting to take part in the greatest adventure of their  lives. Want to know where they're going? going? Take a look. Take a look. Hidden deep in the rain forests of Central America stand the  ruins of an ancient civilization that once prospered... and then vanished. These were the Maya people, and this is the country of  Guatemala. These stunning cities of the past stand as clues to a mystery  thousands of years old. While Europe was in the Dark Ages, it was the Maya who harnessed  the knowledge of the stars and the celestial movements, to create a mystical  union of man, nature, and the gods. It was a world of great kings, elaborate ceremonies, fierce  battles, and even human sacrifice. 18 survivors will be marooned within this mysterious and rugged  terrain. For the first time, the castaways will actually live within the  ruins of a vanished civilization. And they will be forced to embrace the ancient Maya lifestyle. Join us this fall as the adventure continues with Survivor:  Guatemala, the Maya Empire. [ applause, cheering and whistling ] And if you'd like to own  your very own piece of Survivor: Palau, here's how you can do it.
