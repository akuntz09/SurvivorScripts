<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: (roaring) (twittering) (chattering) 18  Americans embarked on a journey to one of the most remote regions of Africa. Welcome to Survivor: Gabon, Earth's last Eden. The diverse group included a high school physics teacher, a world  championship video game player, and an Olympic athlete. <br/>I am a 2004 gold medalist in the women's 4 x 400-meter relay. <br/>Probst: As they split into two tribes, Ace and Sugar connected right off the  bat. <br/>I don't think it would be appropriate for a photographer not to have a model. Sugar, please. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: The tribes were called Fang, in red, and, Kota, wearing yellow. Go! They immediately raced for individual immunity and extra food. Marcus has the idol for Kota. For Fang, GC grabs the idol. Fang lost the challenge by a landslide. Kota wins corn and beans! From the very beginning, Kota was a tribe that could do no wrong. <br/>Our morale was super-high. We're all excited. We love our team. <br/>Probst: The yellow tribe was in perfect harmony. <br/>I felt a little yoga would really get our energy flowing, the chakras would  be all in time. <br/>Probst: Almost. <br/>Ace is kind of getting on my nerves. <br/>Probst: Kota's smallest tribe mate, Paloma, was making waves. <br/>Ace is getting on my nerves. He does not shut up. <br/>Probst: But Kota's problems seem insignificant compared to Fang's. After only six days, the red tribe was starting to look like one of the worst  tribes in Survivor history. <br/>This tribe is hopeless. They're idiots. <br/>Probst: They lost an immunity challenge badly, and voted out one of their  best athletes. They selected a tribe leader, GC, and he quit the next day. <br/>I didn't want to be a leader. I'm not going to let y'all force me to be the leader. <br/>Probst: Gillian's not helping. Fang is falling behind. They lost yet another immunity challenge, and then finally, they did  something that was completely out of character. They made a unified decision. They unanimously voted out their oldest and weakest player. Gillian, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Bummer. <br/>Probst: 16 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Thank God for another night. <br/>Hell, yeah, man. Whatever happens, we made it another night, you guys. <br/>Tribal Council was a no-brainer. Gillian, you got to go. We got rid of a major physical weak link. <br/>Tomorrow is going to be a new day. <br/>We got to win tomorrow. We have to. (clamoring)  And I don't care if it's physical or whatever-- bring it on. Ahh! Okay. (laughter)  I would like to start winning, but the tribe that I have, I still don't  believe it's possible. <br/>Are you trying to break that? <br/>The problem is that they're stupid. I really shouldn't blame them for being complete idiots, but they are. They don't know it, but, but they are. (theme song playing) Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION  *  Oh, man, we're getting it cracking out here. <br/>It's day seven, and we're over halfway finished with our rice. Someone had the bright idea of three meals a day. You know, this is Survivor. Three meals a day? It's ridiculous. We're running low on rice. We're running out. It's not "maybe." It's a fact. I mean, I love three meals a day, but can we compromise at two? Two meals a day? <br/>I can. <br/>I can. <br/>I'm fine with two. <br/>I just, I don't know. I just think, uh, everybody was eating so much at first. I remember throwing away a half a pot of rice the first day. That wasted so much of our rice. And now I'm suffering because some people chose to do that early on. <br/>I'm not suffering. <br/>I am. <br/>In my opinion, the cancer in the tribe is GC. He cannot be told anything. And our tribe is going to continue to have problems until that cancer is  excised. <br/>Randy, are you, like, the leader of the tribe now? <br/>No. We're just sitting here talking, dude. <br/>I'm not...  If you want to start, we'll start it. <br/>It just seems like lately, like the last couple of days, you kind of been  trying to step up into the leadership role. I don't know if that's what you want to do, but you sure are jumpy about it. <br/>No, we decided this tribe doesn't need a leader. So what's your point? Are you asking me if I want to be leader? Okay, the answer's no. And, you know, I don't want to talk about it anymore. Drop it. <br/>I don't have to drop nothing, man. I can ask you something if I want. <br/>And I can just ignore you then. <br/>You can do that if you want. <br/>I don't think we've pulled together as a team. We'd have a much better chance if we were more unified and thinking of this  as a team, rather than, you know, fighting amongst each other. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Ooh! <br/>Whoo! <br/>A fish. It's amazing. <br/>Yay! <br/>Our hero. <br/>My alliance right now is with Marcus, Corinne, and Jacquie. Beyond that, I think Paloma and Kelly are really tight. And Sugar is attached to Ace. And I definitely think Bob is woo-able, and can be used as a swing vote. So there is always the concern that the other five might bond together, but I  think the other five are so all over the place, that we'll be able to keep  the four together. <br/>It's his way or no way. <br/>Like, right now, they're just, like, he's like the king, and everybody's,  like, bowing down to him. I just want to gag every time he opens his mouth. <br/>I know. <br/>Yeah, I know. <br/>I know. <br/>For some reason, me and Ace decided we had some kind of connection. I trust Ace. And I believe that he's going to take care of me as much as he can. <br/>You guys! <br/>Tree mail! <br/>Okay, ready? "This head-to-head battle requires a well-balanced team. To win some camp comfort, you'll kick and you'll scream." Totally  bedding. <br/>Bedding! <br/>Bedding! <br/>We've got water. <br/>Right. <br/>I mean, obviously, I'm not going to say let's throw the challenge, but I'm  saying I'd rather we put out people that are stronger today, so we have those  people that are stronger for the immunity challenge. <br/>Yeah, exactly. <br/>Because I can live without bedding, but I'd rather not go to Tribal. <br/>Everybody seems to adore Ace at this point because right now everybody's just  bowing down to him. They think he's the king, but I can see through it, so I'm not blinded by it. But you know, just from talking to Kelly, I know she has the same frustration. We both are over him. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. * Kota getting your first look at the new Fang Tribe. Gillian voted out at the last Tribal Council. You guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, one member of each tribe will be stationed at  a post. On my go, two members of the other tribe will race out and attempt to remove  you from that post and drag you through the sand to the finish. First tribe to get the member of the other tribe across the finish line  scores a point. One note: players can swap positions each round. First tribe to score two points wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Comfort. <br/>Yeah! (applause)  Probst: Blankets, hammock, pillows, mat. In addition, the winning tribe will send one member from the losing tribe to  Exile Island. Worth playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>You know it. <br/>Probst: Because this challenge requires a specific number of men and women,  Fang, you will sit out one man. Kota, you must sit out three women. Fang, who's going to sit out for you? <br/>I am. <br/>Kenny. <br/>Kenny. <br/>Probst: Ken's going to be the man sitting out for Fang. Kota, who's it going to be? <br/>Us three. <br/>Probst: Corinne, Jacquie, Kelly. Everybody else, head up to the start. Dan is first on the post for Fang. Ace, first on the post for Kota. He's yawning. Wow, you're that relaxed. The attackers for Kota are Charlie and Marcus. The attackers for Fang: GC and Matty. Here we go. For reward. Survivors ready? Go! It's going to be good and physical. Dan, hanging on tight. The big battle between Matty and Ace and GC. <br/>Come on, y'all! Let's go! <br/>Probst: Marcus and Charlie got Dan off the post. Ace proving very strong for Kota. Marcus and Charlie slowly inching Dan toward that finish line. <br/>Come on, Matty! <br/>Probst: Ace not budging against GC and Matty. Marcus and Charlie inching him closer, little by little. (cheering) GC, you got to dig deeper than that. <br/>Come on, GC! <br/>Come on, Charlie! <br/>Probst: Kota very close. GC has given up. Kota scores the first point! Kota leads 1-zip. <br/>Probst: Kota leads 1-zip. Next round, Susie will be on the post for Fang. Paloma will be on the post for Kota. The attackers for Kota: Bob and Sugar. The attackers for Fang: Randy and Crystal. If Kota scores this point, Kota wins reward. Survivors ready? Go! This match looks a little more uneven with Crystal and Randy on the very  small Paloma. This could be over quickly. <br/>You're done! You're done. <br/>Probst: Randy and Crystal have Paloma off the post very fast. They're dragging her up the hill. <br/>There you go. You're done. <br/>Probst: Fang scores! We're tied, 1-1. <br/>Yeah! Get some! Come on and get some! I'm trying to sleep good tonight. <br/>Probst: All right, we are tied 1-1. We're back to the original match-up: Ace and Dan on the poles. The attackers are different this time. Marcus and Bob attacking for Kota. And Crystal and Matty are the attackers for Fang. This is a final round. Playing for reward. Kota would like to make sure Fang does not taste victory. Fang is desperate for a victory. Survivors ready? Go! This is it right here. <br/>Come on, Crystal! <br/>Probst: You need to dig deep like you've never dug before. Dan holding on tight against Marcus and Bob. Ace not budging against Matty and Crystal. Which tribe wants it more? <br/>Crystal, we need this win! <br/>Probst: Matty has the top half of Ace off of the post. Crystal, working on the legs. Bob and Marcus have Dan off the post. Dan hanging on with his last arm. <br/>Nice, Crystal! <br/>Probst: Crystal and Matty have Ace off the post, and they are dragging him! Marcus and Bob starting to make some progress. We are neck and neck. Ace trying to get away. A big takedown! This is a war. Bob and Marcus fighting hard on Dan. Crystal's starting to drag Ace again. Fang getting closer to their first victory! Dan fighting them off. <br/>Don't give up! <br/>Probst: Ace knocks Crystal down. <br/>Crystal! Do it! <br/>I can't hold on much longer! <br/>Probst: Dan screaming for some help. Matty now pulling Ace. Who's got more will? You got to cross the plane. You got to get him across. Fang wins reward! (cheering)  Yeah! <br/>Yes! <br/>Good job! <br/>One, two, three-- Fang! <br/>Probst: Fang, congratulations. Crystal, you look very emotional. <br/>We had to go out here and fight like warriors in order to get some blankets  and some comfort, but it was worth it. <br/>Probst: Fang, big decision to make. Who are you going to send from Kota to go to Exile Island? <br/>We're going to go with someone sweet. So we're going to pick Sugar. <br/>I knew that. <br/>Probst: How'd you know that? <br/>I knew that. I knew that they were going to pick me 'cause they think I'm dumb, but they  haven't talked to me yet. <br/>Probst: Well, the bad news for you, Sugar, you're going to be away from camp,  and as you know, that's never a good thing. <br/>I know. <br/>Probst: The good news is, waiting for you on Exile, a clue to the location of  a hidden immunity idol. Got your stuff? <br/>Yup. <br/>Probst: Map to Exile. Kota, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. All right, Fang, nice job. Get your reward. Head on out. <br/>Hammock. (cheering)  Nice. Everybody, nice. <br/>Good job, man. That challenge felt so good. It felt good for the other tribe to feel the pain that we have been feeling  to walk away with your heads down. <br/>How fun is winning? How awesome is it to come back winning? <br/>You held on. <br/>The reason I held on so long 'cause I got my energy from Matty and from you. Coming back into camp, we were feeling like a team. Finally feeling like we're going to start creating a little bit of a roll  here. I was losing it and you heard me yelling. <br/>I'm all, "Come on, bitch! Come on, bitch!" (laughter)  No, you guys did awesome. <br/>I mean, we had-- we moved our forces back in perfect retreat, which was the  point. <br/>Exactly. <br/>But we did take out our strongest girls, you know? I mean, it was a great, great decision. <br/>That was such a brilliant strategy. <br/>It's hard when, like... I mean, their three strongest, and one of the them  was the girl, it's like...  Yeah. <br/>No. Nobody would of. <br/>Crystal, which is on their team, is huge. Especially compared to me. Like, I'm the shortest person alive, so compared to Crystal, like, I mean, I  just had no chance. It was kind of weird that, like, Ace decided to put me on the pole instead of  Sugar, but, like with Ace, it's kind of like it's his way or the highway. <br/>We should have put Kelly in instead of Paloma. I'm not sure why we sat the three of you guys out. <br/>It would have been fine to put her in for a puzzle or something, but...  Yeah, but what if it wasn't a puzzle? <br/>Yeah, that's...  That's fine. <br/>We're short two pillows. <br/>Big deal. <br/>We'll be fine. <br/>It's not fine when it's, like, we still have to catch fish for her and catch  fish for her tonight, and keep the traps and do all the other stuff. It's, like, I don't know, we're just stuck with Paloma. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It was a bit hard, you know, watching Paloma just give up. Yeah, I think her lack of, um... motivation, let's say, just sort of sealed  what we were all thinking already. Sort of crossed and dotted the "T"s on her contract of death. So whatever. <br/>"In this garden of Eden, a difficult choice you'll face. One choice provides an apple. One choice provides direction. Spend your time in idle comfort or seek idol protection." Going for the  clue. Getting in that cage and having comfort, it would have been nice. But it would have been really stupid because I'm pretty sure since I'm only  the second person sent to Exile Island, that the idol is still out there. "Across the lake you see so well, there lies a sandy crater. The object hidden in its floor will surely help you later." Looks like I  got to go through a jungle. No problem. (gasps): Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh! (screams) This is not my normal thing, obviously. I'm not a camper. I don't like to be dirty. I think I've gone too far. This time, I've gone too far. Yeah... I'm lost. I did Survivor 'cause I thought it might help me grow up a little bit and get  a thicker skin, and get over... not get over, but deal with... my father's  death-- I can't even say it. My father passed away seven months ago. I'm trying to, trying to keep it together because when I stay in survival mode,  then I don't get like this. I'm sure I'll be a stronger person by the end of it all. Playing this game will help me at this time in my life. Oh, thank God! (laughs) Holy... Oh, my God. Did I find... the thing? Or is this a joke? "Now turn around, go back towards the lake. On one tree hill climb for salvation's sake." What? That looks like it could be one tree. Maybe I'll... start with this one. Oh... cool. I don't really know how to play this game, but I'm learning really quick. My confidence is built up a little bit more with each new thing I do. I'm a lot tougher than I thought I was. "Walk along a yonder creek. Beneath the burned wood is the thing you seek." Oh, Lord... Okay, cool. Hey, uh... can you help me out with this? "Through creatures unknown you'll have to wade among the limbs that  reach skyward your deliverance shall be made." Hopefully the idol, right? Not another clue. Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy. I'm going to have to * Wade in the water. That's a big, old tree in the middle of the water. Maybe that's it. Oh, Lordy. I'm going over to that tree. 'Cause it looks like it might have some good hiding spots. Oh, my God. Don't be scared. (screaming) (groans) That was so scary. (gasps): Oh, my God! I found it! Okay, good. Thank God. When Fang sent me to Exile, I thought maybe they thought I was dumb, and that  I'd never find the idol, no way. I can't believe I found it and the lawyer didn't. How funny is that? That's funny. But my dad's been with me this whole time, so I feel like he's been helping  me. Um, he's here. Thank you, my friend. You were awesome. (laughs) Thank you very much. *  Uh-huh. <br/>And those are the two that I'm flip-flopping with. And I know you like Sugar. <br/>I like Sugar as a person. You know, she's loyal. And loyalty stands a lot for this game. You know that. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think we can trust Sugar longer than we can Paloma. <br/>Ace is putting himself at at risk by doing this manipulation. By calling out Paloma, he's protecting Sugar big-time. He wants to keep Sugar. I can see why. If she makes it to the jury, she will vote for him, but that can irritate  people and it worries people. And that's what worries me. <br/>It'll definitely be Paloma and then Sugar. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Or Sugar, then Paloma. I mean, they're going. Ace is doing something very stupid. He's bringing Sugar to the end because she's weak. She needs him. I'll tell you this much. I have, you know, Jacquie, Marcus, Charlie. You know, we're all in your book. As long as, you know, you feel the same way we do, we're all in it together. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And there's five of us. So it's... we can pick whoever we want. We are in the majority. I think Bob responds really well to bold, confident moves. When I was speaking to him, I had to speak to him like, "Here's the deal. These are the four. You're the fifth. That's all you need to know. It's the majority. We're getting rid of this one." That's it. And it doesn't really matter 'cause we're five. So lock it down. That's it. <br/>Good point. <br/>None of us are looking to take Bob to the end. However, we need him for numbers, and I think that we can trust him. <br/>Tree mail. <br/>"Slip, slide, splash and run. The stakes are high, but you'll have some fun. Who is bright and who is slow? Know the difference or be the next to go."  Oh, no! <br/>(gasps): Yay! <br/>Yay! I knew our swimsuits were in there! <br/>Yay! <br/>I think the next immunity challenge is the most crucial one that we've had at  this point. Their one victory has given them some hope. Crushing that hope is going to send them to another level of despair. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Sugar, returning from Exile Island. <br/>Sugar. <br/>Hey, babe. <br/>Oh! That was really wrong. <br/>I know. <br/>Probst: Don't look at me. I didn't send you. It's the game. All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: First things first. I will take it back again. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, one at a time, you will launch yourself down a  slippery slide and into the water. You'll then swim out to retrieve a covered number tile and race back. Once you've collected all six tiles, the remaining tribe member will use  those numbered tiles to solve a math puzzle. The answer will reveal the combination to a chest. First tribe to open their chest and raise their tribe flag... wins immunity. Losers, Tribal Council, where somebody will be going home. Kota, you have two extra members. Who's going to sit out this one? Paloma and Sugar. I'll also give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right, Bob and Ken are waiting to solve puzzle. Everybody else is going down the slide. For immunity, survivors ready? Go! It's Crystal and Kelly first down. Kelly does it perfectly. Crystal takes a hard hit. Both are in the water at the same time. Crystal's tall enough she can actually run to get her first puzzle piece. <br/>Come on, Kelly! <br/>Probst: Kelly coming back. <br/>Come on, Crystal! <br/>Run! <br/>Probst: Crystal out of the water first for Fang. <br/>Run, Crystal, run! <br/>Probst: Susie on the course. <br/>Come on, Kel. <br/>Probst: Fang with a good-sized lead right off the bat. Corinne hits the course. <br/>That was awesome! <br/>Come on, Susie! <br/>Probst: Susie has the second piece to this puzzle. Corinne quickly gets her number. She's heading back. Making up a lot of time on Susie. <br/>Come on, Sue, faster! <br/>You got it! You got it! <br/>Probst: Fang has lost all of their lead now. Charlie on the course for Kota. <br/>Yeah, Charlie! <br/>Probst: Kota now has the lead. <br/>Yeah, Charlie! <br/>Probst: GC on the course for Fang. That's how you do it. Charlie out of the water, heading back for Kota. Kota has three tiles back. Fang, still with two. Kota still with a good-sized lead. Randy on the course for Fang. <br/>Come on, Randy! <br/>Probst: Jacquie out of the water for Kota. Two numbers left. Ace flips over twice. Randy needs to pick it up. Fang has lost more time. Dan on the course for Fang. Still looking to win that first immunity challenge. Ace holding on to Kota's lead. <br/>Ace! <br/>Probst: Kota has one number left in the water. Fang has two more left. A big launch. Marcus heading out for that sixth and final number for Kota. Dan finally out of the water for Fang. Matty's going to have to make up a lot of time. Marcus out of the water with the sixth and final number for Kota. It's now up to Bob to solve the puzzle. <br/>Okay, Bob! You can do it! <br/>Probst: Matty out of the water with that sixth and final number. <br/>Go, Ken! <br/>Probst: Ken racing now, trying to catch up. Got a physics teacher going head-to-head with a video game expert. You don't need to be a math major to figure this out. You just need to be able to concentrate. Read it carefully. Rearrange the numbers. "The sum of both end values will equal the sum of the middle two. The last number is equal to the second, minus the third, and is one less than  the one before it."  Do it! Do it, then! Try it! <br/>Probst: Bob thinks he might have it. Make those numbers into a combination. If you're right, the chest will open. No, he doesn't have it. <br/>I think I got it. <br/>Probst: Ken thinks he has it. Ken tries it. He's not right. Try to look at this puzzle again. Maybe you're putting a comma where it doesn't belong or reading a word wrong. <br/>Oh, are these the end values? <br/>Probst: Bob thinks he might have figured it out suddenly. <br/>I think I got it, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Ken thinks he has it again. <br/>I do, too. <br/>Probst: Bob thinks he has it. Both tribes trying it. Either one of these guys are right, immunity for their tribe. <br/>Pull the damn handle, Bob! <br/>Probst: Bob tries it. He's wrong, once again. Ken has it right for Fang. Fang wins immunity! (cheers)  We did it! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>That's simple math. <br/>Fang! <br/>Probst: Fang, congratulations. Back-to-back wins. This time for immunity. This game is changing. (applause) Kota, date with me tonight at Tribal Council where the third  person will be voted out of this game. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. Fang, you guys going to miss me at Tribal Council? <br/>You need to get to know them a little bit better. <br/>Probst: Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>But the clues are not freaking easy. I had to find my way through, like, a big desert. Saw a spot with this map and I kind of read it wrong or something. I think I played off the fact that I won the idol pretty well. I don't think anybody has a clue that I got it. I'm not too bad at this. I'm a lot better than I thought, for sure. <br/>So I can hang on to this thing for a while, maybe. <br/>Yeah, hang on to it. I mean, I'd obviously, not bring it to Tribal tonight, but I mean, I'd bring  it to Tribal generally. <br/>I just had a very nice conversation in the canoe, being told that Sugar has  the immunity idol. And we're going to hopefully dominate this game. <br/>Paloma tonight. <br/>Paloma's dead. <br/>Yeah, okay. <br/>Um, Kelly's pretty dead after that. <br/>Awesome. I'm pretty excited. <br/>Now, we're all prepping for the coupe de grace, being Tribal Council, and the  dismissal of little Miss Paloma. <br/>Strategically, I'm, like, the animals out in the wilds. I just watch. Just watch, and then I'm going to pounce on someone and eat them up. Has Ace made an alliance with you yet? He's made an alliance with everybody else. <br/>He has? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>He's not said one word to me. <br/>Mm-hmm. He's not said one to me 'cause he doesn't like me. I mean, he's trying everything he can to get rid of me, like putting me on  the pole instead of Sugar. Anyway, think about it. He doesn't want to get rid of Sugar. Ace doesn't want to, and Ace is pretty much running the game. <br/>Hmm. <br/>It's really crazy. Just keep your eyes out because he's really, really sneaky. Like, I'll just say what I need to say really fast till I get people to think  and get their brains going and make them, like, all crazy and, like, thinking. Ace might be, you know, strong as an ox and I might be as weak as a mouse,  but we're both 50/50. People want him out because he's strong. People might want me out because we're weak. <br/>He's not running the show, Paloma. <br/>Well, I mean, not... I mean, personally, I don't really care. I can't stand the guy. <br/>Well, let me see what I can think up. That's not happening. I really can't stand Ace. I'm not sure that that accent is real. I think he's a con artist. I would like it see him go home sooner rather than later. I am afraid if Ace goes with us to the merge he will be the first one to flip  because he's on the outskirts of our alliance. So I went on a walk with Paloma. <br/>Yeah? She tried me to be in an alliance with her. And she was like, "Ace is really dangerous." She goes "The  only reason why Ace made a point to force me to go on the post is so that  everyone could see how bad I was." She's like, "Everyone knew who's..."   I think that could be partly true. <br/>It's 100% true. Afterwards... I know this because afterwards Ace was like, "Did you see  how good a job..."  Sugar wants him. <br/>What, are you...  And she can do it for two seconds, like this. <br/>Not even. It's a problem. Ace needs to get out of here before the merge because we can't have that. <br/>You're smart at this game. There definitely is a short-term benefit to getting rid of our weakest  players because then we can trounce, you know, the other team and not have to  vote off other people. But Ace is the biggest concern because Ace has been playing Sugar like a pawn. <br/>"I'm taking her to the end because she's easy. She follows what I say, like..."  They're going to pull out all the stops at the end. <br/>Getting rid of Paloma, whatever, that can be done later. You want to get rid of Ace earlier before he gains momentum before we merge. That's more important. I don't know. It's hard to say. I dislike so many people on this damn tribe that it's like, it's a toss-up. <br/>Probst: Behind each of you is a torch. Grab a torch, approach a flame, dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council because in this game, fire  represents your life. As long as you have fire, you are still in the game. When your fire is gone, so are you. So, finally, we get a chance to talk. So, Corinne, first Tribal Council, what do you base the vote on? <br/>Everybody has their own opinion of who should be voted out, but the idea is  that you want one opinion together, so that you have as little dissension  among the group as possible. <br/>Probst: Ace, that seems incredibly pie-in-the-sky. "Let's come to one group consensus on who we're going to vote out?"   I think this early in the game, the most important thing is what strengthens  the tribe and makes us stronger for challenges. <br/>Probst: Sugar, let's talk about Exile Island. That's a long time to be alone this early in the game. What do you draw on? <br/>Well, um... I thought about my dad. Damn it. Just because I lost my dad recently, and... And.... <br/>Probst: It's got to be tough. <br/>I missed everyone. <br/>Marcus, there are two ways to play in regards to the idol. One is "Don't try to flush it out 'cause I don't have it." The  other is, "I got it."  You're absolutely right. I mean, I think Sugar's choosing, if she does have it, to let her outside  reflect something completely different than the insides, and, you know, if  that's the case, more power to her. It's probably the way I would play it myself. <br/>Probst: When you got with this group, who jumped out at you you as, wow,  interesting. <br/>Um, I think our tribe actually has a lot of those people, but, I mean, Ace  was a really interesting guy from the start, and he and I seem to work well  together and have a lot of similar ideas. <br/>Probst: Paloma, did Ace stand out to you as having a big personality? <br/>Yeah, definitely. Ace is, like, the head honcho at our campsite. <br/>Probst: How do you feel about that, him being the big guy? <br/>I mean, like, he can be the big guy all he wants. I really could care less. But, I mean, as far as I'm concerned, I'm not even going to go there. <br/>Probst: You're not even going to go where? <br/>Like, do the whole, like, "Ace is my hero" type thing, like...  Probst: So, Ace is clearly not your hero. <br/>No, not at all. <br/>Probst: Ace, does that surprise you to hear that? <br/>Not particularly. I think we have the capacity to rub each other the wrong way. <br/>Probst: Kelly, do you think Ace is an asset to your tribe? <br/>Um, in some cases, because he's almost condescending in a way. <br/>Probst: How is condescending a good thing? <br/>It's not a good thing at all sometimes. Um, say, we're cooking rice or something, he'll be like, "Oh, I thought  we were going to make water." Like, if somebody wants to make rice, let  us make rice. We don't necessarily need water right now. <br/>Probst: Ace, concerned at all that you have two people that are coming up  saying, "By the way, I got two votes and..."  Of course, you know. You can never walk into Tribal Council without being scared. <br/>He doesn't have his bag with him, so he can't be that worried. <br/>There's nothing I really wanted to take from camp. <br/>Think you guys would have been maybe brother-sister in another life? <br/>Maybe, in another world, 1,000 years from now, when I'm dead. <br/>Probst: Wow. All right, Marcus, you have an immunity idol around your neck. It is only good at tonight's Tribal Council. You can, obviously, assign it to somebody if you want or make sure are you  safe and keep it. <br/>I think I'm going to hang on to it this time. <br/>Probst: All right. Tonight, Marcus is safe. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Kelly, you're up. <br/>This is pretty much self-explanatory. <br/>Unfortunately, you know exactly why you're leaving. It's for the strength of the tribe. Best of luck. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote: Paloma. Ace. One vote Paloma; one vote Ace. Ace. Two votes Ace; one vote Paloma. Paloma. We're tied: two votes Paloma; two votes Ace. Paloma. Three votes Paloma; two votes Ace. Paloma. That's four votes Paloma; two votes Ace. Third person voted out of Survivor: Gabon: Paloma. That's five. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Paloma, the tribe has spoken. Well, the truth is, you've lost back-to-back challenges, and now your first  tribe member. Fang clearly has the momentum. Question is, can you get it back? Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

The tightest three is right here. <br/>Probst: Divides again. Today, you're going on to rank your tribe from top to bottom. And the game is turned upside down. <br/>This is not looking too good for a pimp. <br/>So, I got voted off. Um, first person on my tribe to go. These past nine days in Gabon have been amazing. Definitely been an experience, something I've never ever done before. Good luck to the whole Kota tribe. I hope you guys do awesome. But definitely, let's just put it this way: If Ace wins a million dollars, I  will probably never watch Survivor again.
