<br/>JEFF Probst: Deep in the South Pacific... the 20th season of Survivor the  20th season of Survivor began with an invasion. began with an invasion. This season, ten of the greatest heroes... and ten of the most ruthless  villains returned for either villains returned for either revenge or  redemption. revenge or redemption. The Villains took the early lead. Led by Boston Rob, they defeated the Heroes in challenge... the Heroes in  challenge... after challenge. after challenge. The Heroes tribe was quickly whittled down to only five members. But everything changed when Russell challenged Boston Rob for control of the  Villains. He joined forces with Danielle and Parvati, and with some help from Jerri,  they took out Boston Rob's entire alliance, until only Sandra remained,  harboring a grudge against Russell. With the merge looming, J.T. thought he could pull Russell to the Heroes' side by giving him his hidden  immunity idol. <br/>You don't hand the enemy the idol. <br/>Probst: But when the tribes merged... [cheering]  There you go. <br/>Probst: ...Russell gave Parvati J.T.'s own idol to use against him. What Russell didn't know was that Parvati already had an idol of her own, and  at Tribal Council...  Sandra, that's for you. <br/>Probst: ...Parvati made one of the biggest moves of the game. game. <br/>Jerri, that one's for you. <br/>Jerri, that one's for you. <br/>Probst: She played both idols to seal J.T.'s fate. Back at camp, Sandra decided it was time to strike. Russell? You want Russell gone? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Russell's gone. <br/>Probst: She did everything in her power to take out her longtime enemy  Russell. <br/>It's time for revenge, because I've been waiting to take him down for 30 days. <br/>Probst: But the Heroes never listened. Amanda. And instead, went home, one after the other. Yet, all was not lost for the two remaining Heroes. <br/>I want Danielle gone tonight. <br/>Probst: Because acting like a true Villain, Russell turned on his own allies. The tribe has spoken. With alliances shattered, no one was safe. Sandra tracked down a hidden immunity idol to protect herself. <br/>I would hate to go home with the idol in my bra. <br/>Probst: She played it at the last Tribal Council, but she wasn't the one who  needed protection. Rupert, the tribe has spoken. Now only five remain. Colby-- in season two, Australia, he was the sharpshooting Texas gentleman  with a heart of gold. <br/>I'm thankful I'm alive, and I'm thankful I'm a Texan. <br/>Probst: He was a dominant force in challenges. [grunting] This has had a permanent home here for a while. He took a worthy competitor to final Tribal Council, but his honorable  decision was his undoing. The winner of Survivor: The Australian Outback. [cheering] This season, he had a tougher time in challenges. Coach now dragging Colby! Colby first person out of this challenge. Colby, 15 seconds into the challenge, first person out. Without immunity, he was forced to change to a more social strategy. <br/>When you're staring at a jury of nine, not having any enemies, pretty good  place to be. <br/>Probst: Colby is now the last remaining Hero. Can good conquer evil? Parvati. Parvati has always been known as Survivor'sflirty temptress. <br/>When I first saw Parvati, I was, like, "Damn!"  Probst: But in Fans vs. Favorites, she proved herself a cunning strategist...  I'm playing smart this time. Like, I want to make the right alliances with people that I know I can trust. <br/>Probst: ..and brought her black widow brigade to the final four... [laughter]  ...where she ultimately won the million dollars. The winner of Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites. [cheering] This season, she has been just This season, she has been just as  cunning. as cunning. <br/>I don't. <br/>Probst: And just as physical. Cirie and Parvati going at it! Parvati wins immunity. Now that she's played more days than anyone in Survivor history will this  double threat win the million dollars again? Sandra. In Season Seven, Pearl Islands, this feisty mother of two excelled at sneaky  maneuvers. <br/>The two of us, that's it. <br/>Probst: She also wouldn't back down from a fight. <br/>You know what? I can get loud, too! What the ...  Her days are numbered, and I got a mill that says she won't be the final one. <br/>Probst: The winner of Survivor: Pearl Islands. [cheering] This season, she returned for the million dollars again and used  the same tactics-- stealth. <br/>He's a stupid ass. <br/>Probst: And attitude. <br/>Russell, can we just have a minute? It's like, every time I try to do something, somebody is in my face. <br/>Probst: Ever since Russell eliminated her allies, she's eliminated her  allies, she's been working to eliminate him. been working to eliminate him. <br/>I'm against you, Russell. <br/>Probst: Will she finally get her revenge? Jerri. In Season Two, Australia, Jerri became Survivor'soriginal black widow. <br/>It's not like you're making a deal with the devil here. <br/>She will ride the team until it's time to take the knife out and cut  someone's throat. <br/>Probst: She tried to lure people in with her flirtatious nature. <br/>Pouring hot chocolate all over some hot dude's bod. <br/>But I ain't no Hershey bar. [Colby laughs]  Probst: But her pushy attitude eventually did her in. <br/>No, no, no, no. We're going to talk right now. <br/>Probst: Jerri, the tribe has spoken. This season, she switched tactics and made friends instead of enemies...  Are you guys playing Cupid? <br/>Yes. You and the dragon slayer. <br/>The black widow and the dragon slayer. What a combination. <br/>Probst: ...and became a crucial swing vote to take out major players-- Rob...   You're smart, Jerri. Like, you know what to do. <br/>Probst: ...and Danielle. <br/>I'm closer to Parvati than  I'm closer to Parvati than you think. you think. <br/>Probst: Will her new moves give her a shot at the million dollars? Russell. Last season in Samoa, Russell took over his tribe by creating chaos. <br/>I think if I can control how they feel, I can control how they think. <br/>Probst: He made alliances with everyone...  It's just going to be me and you. <br/>All right. <br/>I believe you. <br/>You've got my word. <br/>You have mine. <br/>Probst: ...until they no longer served his needs. <br/>Who's going first? They're going to be my little puppets. When I'm finished with them, I'll just throw them in the trash. <br/>Probst: Burning bridges along the way eventually cost him the million dollars. The winner of Survivor: Samoa. [cheering] This season, more of the same. <br/>Getting rid of the machete will cause conflict in this camp. <br/>Probst: Bullying...  You ain't making any sense. <br/>You ain't making any sense. <br/>You're not listening to me! <br/>You're not listening to me! <br/>Probst: ...and making deals with everyone in sight. <br/>I want to take you all to the top three, man. I want to trust you all the way to the final three. <br/>Probst: Will his aggressive approach finally pay off? After 20 seasons, tonight will be Survivor's biggest finale yet. Among the final five, there are two past winners, two former finalists, and  between them all, over 100 Tribal Councils. Find out tonight who will win the million-dollar prize and the million-dollar  prize and the title of sole survivor. the title of sole survivor. <br/>You did it, too! <br/>That's a terrible play, 'cause it shows that she lied. That's a terrible play. She was safe today. How is that a good strategic play? <br/>You used an idol to save yourself when you didn't...  Right, and it was a bad play for me. You straight up lied to me about You straight up lied to me about it. it. <br/>Every time you played an idol, I found out you had an idol after the fact. You never came to me and said, "Oh, I got an idol!" I played my  idol at Tribal Council, and once we came back to camp, Russell was upset, mad  about how we're supposed to share the idol, and everyone should know. And I'm looking, like, "When you found your first idol, you used the  idol to save Parvati. We didn't know. When you got an idol from J.T., I didn't know." So how come the minute  Sandra gets an idol, I got to go tell Russell? He wants to micromanage the whole tribe, and, unfortunately, I'm not the kind  of person you can micromanage. Sorry. <br/>I don't want to talk about it. It's-It's... What's done is done. What's done is done. Let's move on from it. Let's move on from it. <br/>Because I don't believe you, Parvati. I believe you knew about it. You lying straight in my face. <br/>I did not know about it! <br/>She didn't know. <br/>Parvati, you are lying to me. <br/>No, I'm not, Russell! I didn't know about it. Neither did Jerri. Nobody knew about it. I don't know why it would even matter if I did. <br/>If you knew about it, it's real sneaky. That's the problem. <br/>How is it...? I didn't know about it, okay? Just leave it at that. Done and done. I didn't know about it. <br/>Done and done. All right, done and done. <br/>Okay. Get over yourself for one second. It's ridiculous. I just don't like being accused of being a liar when I clearly of being a  liar when I clearly was not. was not. <br/>I could care less if Russell's running around stomping his feet like a little  two-year-old child who got his toy taken away, 'cause that's pretty much what  he's acting like, and it makes him look like a fool. <br/>Oh, this has been a thing with me from the beginning of this whole game. I've been, like, "Get rid of her. She's dangerous."  We've got to get rid of her. We've got to get rid of her. <br/>She's dangerous. <br/>I'm the last Hero standing, and once again, the Villains go at it. And any time this dysfunctional family of Villains is not getting along, it  takes the getting along, it takes the attention off me. attention off me. attention off me. [theme song playing] [theme song playing] [theme song playing]  Treemail! <br/>Treemail? <br/>Bag of puzzle pieces. [overlapping chatter]  A puzzle? <br/>A puzzle. <br/>A puzzle. <br/>Okay. "If your steady hands work to perfection, maybe then you'll win  protection. But lose control and it won't matter. Sit back as your dreams and your dishes shatter." That's the same one  they had in China. <br/>If Colby doesn't win individual immunity, he's going to have to go home. But if Colby does win, I'm going to have to make a going to have to make a  decision. decision. <br/>I know! <br/>Up again. The perfect scenario for me to win is me, Sandra and Jerri in the top,  because Sandra didn't play the game at all, and Jerri didn't play the game at  all. The jury doesn't even have a decision. They almost have to vote for me. So if Colby wins individual immunity, then the best thing to do is probably  get rid of to do is probably get rid of Parvati. Parvati. Parvati. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Day 37. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Phew. <br/>Probst: Guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Parvati, first things first, I will take it back. [Jerri laughs] Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will balance ceramic dishes on the end of a long,  wobbly balancing arm. The more dishes you stack, the more difficult it will be to keep them stable. When your dishes fall, you're out of the challenge. Last person left standing wins immunity and a one-in-four shot at the million  dollars. We'll draw for spots. We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. We'll get started. All right, here we go. Put your arm up on the ball, everybody. First plate is the large plate. Let's get used to it for a second. This is all about concentration. Three, two, one. All right, let's put a large bowl on there. Three, two, one. We're locked in. All right, let's add another large plate. Three, two, one. That sun is out. That sun is out. It's early and it's already hot. It's early and it's already hot. It's early and it's already hot. You are now stacked nine dishes high. Sandra wobbling a little bit. Jerri starting to wobble a Jerri starting to wobble a little bit. little bit. Sandra-- first person out of this challenge. Take a spot on the bench. We are down to four. The next dish you're going to add is a small plate. Three, two, one. Everybody's good. Jerri wobbling. Get it back under control. Get it back under control. You have 14 different dishes stacked right now. stacked right now. Jerri once again unstable. Jerri once again unstable. [Jerri gasps] Jerri can't hold it any longer. Jerri is the second person out of this challenge. We are now down to three. Russell, Parvati, Colby. All right, it's time to add another soy dish. This will be the 15th plate on your stack. Three, two, one. Everybody good. Nice job. Time to add another dish. You're going to add a medium bowl. Here we go. <br/>Wow. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one. <br/>Probst: Three, two, one. Russell with a bit of a waver. Russell with a bit of a waver. Russell wobbling. Russell can do nothing but watch his plates fall. Russell is out of the challenge, and we are now down to two-- Parvati and  Colby-- for immunity and a one-in-four shot. Wind coming up. Big gust of wind. Big gust of wind. Hang tight. Hang tight. Colby starting to wobble a bit but getting it back. Whatever it takes, keep running it in your head. Keep reminding yourself what you're doing. Do not drift. Time to add another dish. You're going to add a large bowl. Take your time. Finding it. Don't rush. I'll give you plenty of time to get there. Colby has his bowl, places it in, and it's wobbling. Parvati has hers, trying to set it in. Get it level, get it how you want it. Three, two, one. Three, two, one. And we're good. And we're good. And we're good. You now have 17 dishes stacked. You now have 17 dishes stacked. Without warning, Colby's plates drop. Parvati wins her second immunity challenge in a row. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Yeah. Dang. <br/>Probst: Parvati, come on over. Congratulations once again. Parvati safe tonight at Tribal Council, guaranteed a spot in the final four. Colby, Sandra, Jerri, Russell, it has been 37 long days in Heroes vs. Villains. For one of you, that's as far as you go. Somebody going home tonight. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I'll see you at Tribal. Congratulations. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Once again Parvati escapes her elimination vote. I mean, it's unbelievable how this game works sometimes. It's not like it's the end of the world. We still have one more person that we can get rid of, that being Colby, but,  you know, it's still Survivor,and anything can still Survivor,and anything  can happen. happen. <br/>Winning today is a huge deal for me because I am safe and I can keep the rest  of my Villains here. If Colby had won the challenge, it would have been insanity here today and I  would have had to make a decision that I didn't want to make right now. <br/>Guys, can I just say... [Colby sighs] I made my play yesterday to break you  guys up. It didn't work. I had my opportunity today to win immunity, and damn you, I couldn't get it  done. [Parvati laughs] Let's enjoy day 37. I'm proud to be the last Hero standing, but I'm not going to hustle today,  I'm not going to scramble. I have enjoyed playing with you guys, I really have. I needed to win today's immunity challenge and I didn't. I've tried, I've tried. I really needed that one. So we came back into camp, I gathered all the Villains, and I gave them my  surrender speech. <br/>You make me sad. <br/>You made me cry. <br/>Oh, come on. See, that's actually my last attempt... [Jerri and Parvati laugh] ...is the  sympathy vote. If I can't beat you in the challenges, maybe I'll get an "Aw,  shucks" vote. <br/>It's good. <br/>"Aw, shucks, he's so pathetic, let's keep him around one more day."   Aw! <br/>Pretty good speech, actually. Hell, I almost convinced myself I was giving up, but I don't know how to quit. It's just not in me. I've never quit anything in my I've never quit anything in my life. life. life. So when the time was right... So when the time was right... [exhales]  [exhales] I made one more attempt. I made one more attempt. So what are your thoughts? Send me home? Yeah. So the idea is to get rid of me and then hopefully get rid of Parvati  tomorrow and take Sandra in? <br/>That's the idea, but...  Right. Well, my case is: get rid of Sandra tonight, then the three of us have a  better shot at beating Parvati tomorrow. <br/>Colby comes back from the immunity challenge and he's basically quitting. Then, 30 minutes later, he comes up to me telling me, "Hey, man, I think  I still can help you."  Yeah, I think Parvati is going to get a ton of votes, especially if she keeps  winning like this. I haven't had a chance to talk to Jerri yet. <br/>I got Jerri. Trust me. Tonight's Tribal Council is going to be very interesting because you think  about it, it might be the best strategic move to keep Colby and to get rid of  Sandra. You know, I don't trust Sandra as far as I can throw her. We keep Colby, it helps us beat Parvati. The problem with keeping Colby is he could possibly go to the top three, and  that's it-- my top three, and that's it-- my game's over. game's over. I don't know what to do this time. I've got to think: what is the best option for me, only me? I'm going to wait till Tribal Council, see what they have to say, and make my  decision right say, and make my decision right there. there. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Coach, Courtney, J.T., Amanda, Candice, Danielle, and Rupert, voted out at  the last Tribal voted out at the last Tribal Council. Council. Colby, the last remaining Hero. Third time you played the game, it seems like it's been the toughest. <br/>The toughest out of the three, but also just the toughest journey to get here. The challenges have been the biggest disappointment, bar none. I needed this immunity more than any of them. Didn't work out. Parvati's a heck of a competitor, and if I had won immunity today, she might  be going home tonight. <br/>Probst: So, Colby, it would seem like there are four Villains who could  easily just say, "Let's just stay with the plan, get rid of Colby, and  then we'll figure out what to do tomorrow."  Right. <br/>Probst: On the flip side, if there is a big move to be made, tonight would be  a great time to do it. <br/>Yeah, there's hope. And I've been hustling. Trying to convince Russell, specifically, to take me and not Sandra, and  that's a tough sell. Would have been easier if Sandra had won immunity today. <br/>Probst: You mean easier to get rid of Parvati? <br/>Yeah, because nobody really wants to sit next to Parvati in the finals. I love you to death, Sandra, but everybody wants to sit next to you. <br/>Well, that's news to me. Then I should be smiling. I shouldn't have packed, huh? <br/>Probst: If it's true. That's the rub. If it's true. <br/>No, you're good. I mean, say what you got to say. <br/>Probst: So, Sandra, how much of what you hear around camp do you believe at  this point? <br/>This is Survivor. You can't believe nobody. <br/>Probst: Parvati, you've been in this game with three of these people from one. Yet, the ability to say, "Yes, I believe you, 100%."  No. No way. I mean, not since day one and not today. And listening to Colby say that it would be much easier for him if I didn't  have this necklace, and I would be going home tonight... I'm, like,  "That's news to me, because..."  I said, there's a chance. <br/>I mean, I've been promised the moon, the stars, the sun, the sky, everything. You know, we'll see what happens. But I don't believe anyone. <br/>Probst: Russell, anybody here you believe 100%, there's no chance they would  lie to you? <br/>You just got to hope that those true alliances that you thought you had and  that you tried to build at the beginning help you at the end. But you know, sometimes it just doesn't work out that way. <br/>Probst: And Colby, that inability of the Villains to trust each other is  exactly where your hope lies. <br/>Yeah, and you know, so many nights and so many different days since we merged,  the Villains run through these implosions, you know, where the conflict  starts. And that's what you want. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to find out where the loyalties lie. Parvati has the necklace. You cannot vote for her. Anybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. It's time to vote. Parvati, you're up. Parvati, you're up. <br/>Well, Colby, today's your day  Well, Colby, today's your day to go home, so, adios. to go home, so, adios. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote-- Colby. First vote-- Colby. Sandra. One vote-- Colby, one vote-- Sandra. Colby. Two votes-- Colby, one vote-- Two votes-- Colby, one vote-- Sandra. Sandra. 16th person voted out and the eighth member of our jury-- Colby. That's three. That's enough. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Colby, the tribe has spoken. Colby, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. Congratulations on making it to the final four. Tomorrow you'll compete in your final immunity challenge. I encourage you-- try to get a good night's sleep. You're going to need it. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>I know if I had won that challenge today, I'd have a shot at a million  dollars. It's disappointing, especially when the challenges were something that I used  to be good at. I guess I'm just an old, dusty veteran. My third time in, I'm just not My third time in, I'm just not destined to win  this game. destined to win this game. <br/>Finally! <br/>Oh! <br/>Unbelievable. <br/>I can't believe it. <br/>When Rupert looked like a crazy serial killer...  Yeah. <br/>...I thought he was going to lunge over and kill someone. <br/>Yeah, he just looked like a lunatic. <br/>He is a lunatic. <br/>So what? He wrote my name down. I don't care. [Jerri laughs] Just like Colby wrote my name down two times, too. <br/>Tonight at Tribal when Colby said that it would have been easier to get rid  of me, it was kind of an eye opener for me. I didn't realize that I was such a huge threat, like, with the jury. So now I feel like I really have to try extra hard to win this immunity, to  make sure that I'm sitting there in the final sitting there in the final  three. three. <br/>She went to the well. <br/>She went to the well. We have to win, Russell. We have to win, Russell. We have to win, Russell. <br/>We have to win. <br/>We have to win. <br/>We have to win. <br/>Yup. <br/>Yup. <br/>I know. I know it. I need to beat Parvati. She has really proven to me that she is a really tough she is a really tough  competitor. competitor. <br/>Yeah, I know. <br/>Well...  Like a nice little birdie. It's a fairly tough decision now, because my main alliance is Parvati, and  I'm leaning towards sending Parvati home. <br/>Guess what I have. <br/>Get out of here! <br/>It better not be a map. <br/>Believe it. <br/>It kind of looks like a map! <br/>It's a map. <br/>I don't know. <br/>Oh, my gosh! [screaming happily]  All right, read. <br/>Okay. "Congratulations, Final Four."  Yay! <br/>"You are almost at the end. Follow the map to the ceremonial beach. There you'll find the torches of your fallen comrades. At each torch, you will collect a representative mask of those who were voted  out before you. At the end of your journey, you'll offer them up to the burning man, paying  respect to their memory, as they each had a part in getting you to this point. You'll then proceed to your You'll then proceed to your final immunity  challenge." final immunity challenge." The rites of passage-- it's  where you pay tribute to your fallen comrades. So it's really nice, because this has been the hardest game I've ever played  in my life, and it's because of the people that I played with. Everyone fought to play this game as hard as they could, so I'm ready to pay  my respects. They deserve it. <br/>Sugar! <br/>Oh, Sugar. <br/>Well, I definitely have more faith in myself this trip than the last time I  played Survivor. That's the hardest thing about this game. You can't play with your heart all the time. You have to play with your head. You can't win this game playing good all the time. You just can't. You just can't. I proved that. I proved that. <br/>Stephenie! <br/>Stephenie. She was hard core, too. <br/>Yeah, I was kind of shocked that she went out second, she was such a tough  competitor. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I did get hurt on the first day, but it's a part of the game. I can live with it. I mean, I definitely think people were gunning for me because I had such a  reputation for being such a strong competitor. My reputation was probably one of my hardest things to of my hardest things  to overcome. overcome. <br/>Oh, Randy! Randy-- every morning made me smile and laugh. He was a good friend to me. <br/>My lack of ability to communicate with 26-year-old girls is what got me  booted, ultimately. And I'm not ashamed of that. What phases me is having people clearly stupider than me controlling my fate,  and there's controlling my fate, and there's nothing I can do about it. nothing I can do about it. <br/>Cirie. <br/>She was vicious in the challenges. [laughter]  People underestimate Cirie as a physical competitor. She's really tough. <br/>I attempted to play different this time, but I felt like I wasn't given a  chance. I feel like people came in, you know, with "We got to get her. She's a schemer," just straight out. You don't even know if that was the game I was going to play this time. You know, so never judge a book You know, so never judge a book by its cover. by its cover. <br/>Oh, Tom. <br/>He seemed like a real trustworthy person. <br/>He was the first winner to go, too. What a shame. <br/>The fact that you can be the winner and dominate one season and be the cast-aside  who gets dropped for a guy who's jumping around on one foot in your next  season I think is what makes the game special and what made it game special  and what made it worth playing. worth playing. <br/>Tyson! <br/>Oh! He had such a sense of humor. <br/>The funny guy. <br/>When you play with these all-stars, everybody's just out for blood  immediately. I was in control until I made a stupid move. I was basically the victim of my own stupidity. America thinks I'm an idiot, but as far as I'm concerned, but as far as I'm  concerned, I'm still the winner. I'm still the winner. I'm still the winner. <br/>Careful. <br/>Careful. <br/>James! Seriously, what a competitor, though. I mean, he hurt his knee and he still competed in the next two challenges. <br/>When the big guys fall, they fall hard. <br/>This time I actually tried to be a little more conversational with with  people. I talked more. I was more friendly, I guess. There was this injury, and something you have to deal with. I had a great time, but an I had a great time, but an injury got me in the  end again. injury got me in the end again. <br/>So, Rob. <br/>Boston Rob. <br/>Rob, if you ain't with me, you against me. <br/>Boston Rob! <br/>Too bad, too bad the poor old guy didn't be who he was messing with. [Jerri laughs]  Leave him alone! <br/>He did do a lot for morale in the beginning. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>He told me one time, he said, "Me and you, we're going to get along  'cause Puerto Ricans and Italians are loud and ignorant," and I died  laughing. <br/>When I first played this game, I was 25 years old. I'm 33 now, and I can still hang in there with the young guys. I can still do it, but, you know, at one point I passed out, but I came  through all right. You know, the new generation of players are smarter now. I got to applaud them for getting rid of me. It's the first smart thing they've done in 20 seasons. they've done in 20 seasons. They're starting to learn. They're starting to learn. <br/>Careful. <br/>Oh, Coach. <br/>Oh, no, it's Coach. <br/>Benji. <br/>Coach Potato. <br/>Your lover boy. <br/>Oh... you guys. <br/>Jerri's boyfriend. <br/>He was my partner in crime there for a little while and we had some really  good talks. See, I can pay homage to you, Coach. <br/>Namaste. <br/>Namaste. <br/>I know, among all of the survivors that people have hated to hate, loved to  hate, and hated to love, I was and am number one on the hit list, and I'm  proud of that fact. Inspiring other people but at the same time making myself a better man, and  through all of that myriad of experiences, I that myriad of experiences, I  found redemption. found redemption. <br/>Courtney. <br/>Courtney. <br/>Oh, little one. <br/>I miss you, Courtney. <br/>Usually, on a regular season, you get a bunch of duds. This time there were just no pawns here. It was-- everyone was the master of the chess board, and they were all  playing a different game. So I sum up the experience as: I'm really glad I came and did it. I did the best I could, and, you know, getting on the jury on an All-Stars,  that's not that easy. <br/>Oh, J.T. You know what? You never would have known that a Hero helped a Villain make their biggest  move of the game, giving him his hidden immunity idol. <br/>He was the second winner to go, too. <br/>Poor J.T. <br/>Never give your heart to a Villain, J.T. [Jerri laughs]  I feel like I done really well. I just, you know, I made a big move early in the game. I gave my idol to the biggest Villain in the game-- Russell-- and he used it  to vote me out. It was beautiful. So I would say my experience this time was much more humbling. <br/>Amanda. <br/>Amanda. <br/>That was the first time that girl has ever been voted out of the game of  Survivor. <br/>Overall, I'm proud of how I played. I think my biggest mistake in this game was giving Danielle back the clue. I should have kept it. That was my lifeline, but my conscience got the best of me. I am just not destined to win I am just not destined to win this game. this game. <br/>Candice. <br/>Oh, Candice. <br/>I'm glad you got to enjoy those peanut butter and jelly sandwiches before you  went. <br/>Was it worth a million dollars? <br/>Hell, no. <br/>A million-dollar sandwich? <br/>Hell, no. <br/>Making it to the 13th person voted out this time, I think, is a much more  serious accomplishment than it was last time because I beat people that were  harder to beat this time. I'll definitely take a few I'll definitely take a few lessons home. lessons home. <br/>Danielle. <br/>She was my little Boston brawler. She always stood up for me. I miss you, Danielle. <br/>And I'm sorry, Danielle. [Parvati laughs]  I'm not. <br/>I am. <br/>This was the most intense thing I've ever had to go through in my life, and I  have no regrets. I was proud of the way I performed in my challenges, and I think I showed  that, you know, that I have a heart and I am a good person and I'm not a  Villain. <br/>Oh, Rupert. <br/>Rupert. <br/>The pirate. <br/>He was nice. <br/>Arr, me fire. <br/>Arr, me toe. We hope your toe gets better. <br/>To have my torch put out instead of making it to day 39 and being able to sit  in the final Tribal Council felt very bad, but I feel very, very good about  the way that I played the game and the way that I showed that label of Hero,  I deserved it. it. <br/>Colby, my favorite cowboy. <br/>Oh, Colby. <br/>Colby. <br/>My Outback comrade. <br/>I think he was the real, true Hero of 'em all. <br/>He really is. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm almost ten years older than I was the first time I played this game. Not as fast, not as strong. Yeah, I'm disappointed. I'm frustrated in the fact that I'm out of the game and the game is still  going, but I'm proud of the way I played. I outlasted all the other I outlasted all the other Heroes. Heroes. Heroes. <br/>Cool. <br/>Cool. <br/>Cool. <br/>Okay, light her up. <br/>Okay, light her up. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Whoo! <br/>You go, girl. <br/>You go, girl. <br/>Now, that's a fire. <br/>Now, that's a fire. <br/>High five. <br/>High five. [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter] [cheering] [cheering]  Villains for life. <br/>Villains for life. <br/>Villains for life. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Are you ready to get to your final immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Parvati, give it up one more time. one more time. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs. Today you will compete in a Survivor maze. You'll each be blindfolded. To help you navigate your way, there will be a series of guideposts, but  because you're blindfolded, you will have to use your fingers to read the  symbols. Each guidepost leads you to four different stations where you must collect a  corresponding necklace. Once you have all four necklaces, make your way to the finish, the immunity  necklace will be waiting for you. First person to finish wins immunity, is guaranteed a spot at the final  Tribal Council. That means you get a shot at the money, a chance to plead your case to the  jury. If you lose, Tribal Council tonight could be the last part of this game you  see. Guys ready to get to it? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get you blindfolded up. you blindfolded up. We'll get started. We'll get started. All right, here we go. For immunity and a guaranteed spot at the final Tribal Council. Survivors ready? Go! Go! <br/>Ow! [laughter]  Somebody else is going for the same one. <br/>Probst: The only thing that can help point you in the right direction are the  guideposts. The guideposts will point you to each of the four stations. <br/>Damn, move out of my way. <br/>Oh...  Probst: Russell has his first necklace. He's heading out. Jerri has her first necklace. She's heading out. Parvati has her first necklace. Sandra's still searching. <br/>Oh. <br/>Probst: Jerri using that guidepost to point her toward her next necklace. Parvati using that guidepost. <br/>Ow! <br/>What is that? <br/>Sandra, that's me. <br/>Probst: Sandra tries to take Parvati's necklace off her neck. <br/>Geez. <br/>Probst: Russell searching for that second necklace. <br/>Is this the stupid box? How many times did I come over here? <br/>Probst: Sandra finally gets  Probst: Sandra finally gets that first necklace. that first necklace. Russell has his second necklace. Russell now with two necklaces, everybody else with one. Jerri using the guidepost again. Parvati gets lined up and takes off. Parvati has her second necklace. Jerri now with two necklaces, along with Parvati and Russell. Sandra with one. You need to keep in mind: which symbols have you collected? Which ones do you need? You know which symbols you have. They're hanging around your They're hanging around your neck. neck. <br/>Ow! <br/>Probst: Parvati banging into all kinds of dead ends. <br/>It hurts. <br/>Probst: Jerri has her third necklace. Jerri now in the lead with three necklaces. Russell and Parvati with two. [Parvati exclaims] Parvati has her third necklace. <br/>Parvati, where are you? I just heard you scream. <br/>Probst: Parvati now with three necklaces. Jerri with three necklaces. <br/>Get away. <br/>Probst: Without using a guidepost, Sandra is using something else-- Parvati's  voice. She knows she just got a She knows she just got a necklace. necklace. <br/>Oh, a box. <br/>Probst: Sandra has her second necklace! <br/>Thank God. <br/>Probst: Sandra and Russell now with two necklaces each. Jerri and Parvati with three necklaces. Russell now doing what Sandra did. Russell now has his third necklace. Russell, Jerri, Parvati, all looking for one final necklace. Sandra with two. She's got to pick it up. Parvati at a guidepost. Will it put her any closer? Russell and Parvati run into each other. Both with three necklaces, looking for that fourth and final necklace. <br/>Oops, sorry. <br/>Probst: Jerri looking for her fourth necklace. Russell has his fourth necklace. Parvati has her fourth necklace. Parvati and Russell both with four necklaces, both looking for the finish. Jerri needs that fourth necklace. <br/>Get off me! Get off me! <br/>Probst: This is where patience will pay off. If you go the wrong way, you will lose this challenge. Jerri has her fourth and final necklace. We now have three people with their necklaces-- Jerri, Parvati, Russell. First one to the finish guaranteed a spot in the final Tribal Council. The center symbol will lead you to the finish and the immunity to the finish  and the immunity necklace waiting for you. necklace waiting for you. Russell on the move. Parvati on the move again. Parvati on the move again. Jerri at a guide post. Jerri at a guide post. Parvati at another guide post. Parvati at another guide post. Jerri on the move. Jerri on the move. All you have to do is find that finish pole and grab the finish pole and grab  the immunity necklace first. immunity necklace first. Russell hits the post! <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Probst: Russell wins immunity. <br/>For real? Oh. <br/>Probst: What a finish. <br/>Dang! <br/>Probst: Russell, Jerri, Parvati. <br/>Wow! <br/>Probst: All three within inches of the finish. It doesn't get any closer than that. <br/>That was fun. Very fun. <br/>No, it wasn't. It sucked. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It was awful. <br/>Probst: Well, I have to say, in all of my time on Survivor, that is one of  the most dramatic finishes of any challenge, let alone the final immunity  challenge. Russell, come on over. Why did you take it off, man? That's yours. <br/>If you put it on me, then it's official. <br/>Probst: Fair enough. Glad to do it. Russell safe at tonight's Tribal Council, which means you will go to final  Tribal Council. You will get a chance to plead your case for a million dollars. Also at Tribal Council tonight, two of you will go on to the final Tribal  Council. One of you will go home. Going to be an interesting afternoon. I look forward to seeing you at Tribal Council. <br/>We'll be there. <br/>Probst: Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I got to talk to Russell, make sure I'm still his girl, you know, because you  never know with that one what he's going to do. Russell's thinking I'm his biggest threat when it comes to jury votes? I could be going home. You know, not having that necklace around my neck, I have no protection going  into Tribal, no protection going into Tribal, and that scares me. and that scares me. <br/>Oh. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>What a day! <br/>Oy. <br/>That was unbelievable. <br/>What a day! So basically, the fact that Russell won immunity means that Parvati is going  home. If I watch her torch get snuffed and her walk off, I'm not going to cry about  it. I'm going to be very happy I'm going to be very happy about it. about it. <br/>You know why everybody wants to take you to the end? <br/>'Cause I already won, and they'll win against me? <br/>Yeah. <br/>But I don't care. I'll take the $100,000. Because I knew I wasn't going to win again. <br/>And no matter what, in any circumstances, I'm keeping Sandra. I think she might get Courtney's vote, and that's it. So I'm going to use Sandra for me to win a million dollars. me to win a million dollars. She can't beat me. She can't beat me. <br/>All right. <br/>Straight up. <br/>I'll take the $100,000. You know how I feel. <br/>That's the... It just... It just makes sense to me. <br/>Russell won immunity, so essentially, I have to do whatever Russell says  because he's wearing the idol. I'm feeling wonderful because, regardless, Russell's keeping me around  because I'll never get a single vote. get a single vote. But I don't know about that. But I don't know about that. But I don't know about that. [squeaking] [squeaking]  I got to go for a walk, but  I got to go for a walk, but those might be good. those might be good. <br/>You want her with us? <br/>Yup, 'cause, uh, Jerri...  Okay, well, let me just... let me just say something before you make that  decision, okay? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>If Sandra's with us, she instantly gets Amanda, Candice and Courtney. <br/>I don't think so. No, I'd rather take Jerri. I mean, I'd rather put Jerri on the jury, 'cause I got her vote. <br/>What if she doesn't vote for you? What if she votes for Sandra? <br/>Parvati wants me to get rid of Sandra because she can't even beat Sandra. She surely can't beat me, so she's trying to find out a way to possibly get  second. It's a scenario that's been through my head over and over all kind of  different ways. Best option for me is to take Jerri and Sandra, and that would be the best  strategic move for me. <br/>Your best strategic move? <br/>Would be Jerri and Sandra. <br/>No, 'cause Sandra would win. <br/>Well, you know, it gives me two people that I could sit there and say,  "Please, ask these people what strategic play that they made in the  entire game besides sunbathing." Right now, I'm on the fence, because if  I send Jerri home, I'll get her vote. If I send Parvati home, I don't know if I will get her vote, but I might. Tonight's Tribal Council is extremely a hard decision. I suffered way too much in this game not to win it. game not to win it. I have to win this thing. I have to win this thing. I mean, we let the chips fall I mean, we let the chips fall where they may. where they may. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Coach, Courtney, J.T., Amanda, Candice, Danielle, Rupert, and and Colby,  voted out at the last and Colby, voted out at the last Tribal Council. Tribal Council. So, Jerri, you get back to camp. You don't have immunity. So not only do you have to think about who you want to vote out. You have to make sure it's not you who is voted out. How much of your time is spent making sure it's not you? <br/>Well, getting back to camp, you know, normally, I just walk off and go sit by  myself on the beach and think about things and contemplate everything that's  going on in the game. But today, I didn't really leave camp. I stuck around the whole time. <br/>Probst: Sandra, you get back to camp. You don't have immunity, either. <br/>What do I do? I go to the person with immunity, because they're not going home, and you  want to let that person know, this is why you should keep me, and these are  the votes... I might possibly get one, if that, so, you know, who better to  go up against? 'Cause I don't want to go home in fourth. <br/>Probst: So your play to Russell was, "Take me 'cause I can't win."  Yeah, and Russell already knew that. He tells me all the time. [Jerri laughs]  Probst: That you can't win? <br/>Yeah. Well, kind of. No? <br/>You never know what's going to happen. She could easily, possibly win. This is when the decision-making is, to me, the most important and the  hardest. You know, alliances are going to get broke tonight. And the decision-making is, who do you want to bring that you think that you  can beat when it comes down to it? <br/>Who has friends, who doesn't, who might potentially give you a vote. Who definitely won't give you a vote. You got to sort it out. You got to write it in the sand. [laughter] Do the math. <br/>Probst: Parvati, after winning two immunity challenges in a row, you don't  win today. <br/>I feel vulnerable. I feel very vulnerable, especially knowing that I have played a good,  strategic game, and if people are trying to vote out threats, then I'll  probably be walking out that path tonight. <br/>Probst: Jerri, what case do you make to Russell? Why keep you? <br/>Well, Parvati's a huge threat. You know, that's a scary thing. So that's kind of the case I push. <br/>Probst: Why is Parvati a huge threat? <br/>'Cause she's been kicking butt, and she's got a lot of friends over there,  and it's... You know, it's no secret. Right now, that is a threat. <br/>Probst: So, Parvati, Sandra says, "Take me. I can't win." Jerri says, "Get rid of Parvati. She can win." What case do you make to Russell? <br/>I say, if he's going to be loyal to anyone in this game, if he wants to  redeem himself... [laughs] ...as far as Villains go, then take me, you know. I've been your girl this whole time. I've been protecting you. I've had your back this whole time. That's as good as I can get. Is... Was just...  You've been protecting me? How have you been protecting me? <br/>We've been protecting each other... since day one. <br/>Hmm. <br/>You disagree? <br/>Oh, I think I've been protecting you. <br/>We've been protecting each other. I've never gone against him, which I could have many times, because we argue  a lot, you know. <br/>Probst: Now, Russell, Parvati could easily have said, "You're right,  you've been protecting me." She didn't. She looked you in the eye, and she said, "We've been protecting each  other."  It kind of annoys me. <br/>Probst: So, Russell, completely different experience for you today. You have the upper hand. You have the power. <br/>Everybody has came to me today and told me what they were thinking, and every...  Everybody made perfect sense. You know, everybody's playing strategically today. <br/>Probst: And all three of them are smiling right now. are smiling right now. [laughter] [laughter] All right, let's get to it. Russell has the immunity necklace. You cannot vote for Russell. He is guaranteed a spot at the final Tribal Council. Parvati, Jerri, Sandra, one of you is about to be sent home. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Parvati, you're up. Parvati, you're up. <br/>Hopefully, it's you tonight, not me, 'cause I want to win. not me, 'cause I want to win. Sorry. Sorry. <br/>I have mad respect for you, Parvati. You have shown again that you are capable of kicking some serious butt, and  for that reason, it is not a good idea to sit next to you in the final sit  next to you in the final three. three. <br/>Sorry I had to do this. I trusted you the entire game. I believe you would have been loyal to me, but now my best shot to win this  game is to get shot to win this game is to get rid of you. rid of you. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote-- Parvati. First vote-- Parvati. Jerri. One vote-- Parvati, one vote-- Jerri. Jerri. Two votes-- Jerri, one vote-- Parvati. One vote left. Seventeenth person voted out, and the ninth and final member of our jury--  Jerri. of our jury-- Jerri. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Probst: Jerri, the tribe has spoken. spoken. <br/>Bye, guys. <br/>Bye, guys. <br/>Probst: Well, congratulations on going as far as you can go in this game. Tomorrow night, the power in this game shifts to the jury. All you can do is get a good night's sleep, because you're going to need your  wits about you tomorrow as you attempt to convince them why you deserve the  title of Sole Survivor and the million dollars that goes along with it. Grab your torches. We'll see you tomorrow for final Tribal Council. <br/>Crap! One more night! I was so sure I had this one. This is kind of the Villain way. I'm leaning towards voting for Russell just because he's played an amazing  game. He's a little reactionary and hotheaded, but for the most part, Russell makes  decisions that make sense. that make sense. Except tonight. Except tonight. <br/>Final three! <br/>Unbelievable. Unbelievable. <br/>It has been quite a ride. Ta-da! <br/>Yeah, I'm ready to go home to my house, my kids and my dog. Although you're trying to focus on the game, you still tend to go back and  think about, I wonder what my kids are doing. I wonder what my husband's doing. If I think about my husband-- he's out in Afghanistan. Is he okay? Did he make it through today? You know, it's not easy. All right, y'all, I think I'm going to bed. <br/>What? <br/>You're going to leave us alone? <br/>Yup, there's no need to baby-sit y'all any more. [Russell and Parvati laughs] He's out there in Afghanistan fighting for our  country, and here I am fighting to be the Sole Survivor, you know. Um, but to me, it's worth it. Yeah, I don't get to talk to him. Yeah, I don't know how he's doing, but inside, I know he's okay. okay. I have that gut feeling. I have that gut feeling. <br/>Yeah. <br/>That's it. <br/>Yup. <br/>So I have to focus on the game, because I came for one reason and one reason  only-- for another million dollars. And if that makes our life easier, then why not? This is how I hustle. This is how I make my money. I come and play Survivor. That's what I know how to do. That's what I'm best at. Coming out here, getting my money, going home. money, going home. Simple as that. Simple as that. <br/>All right, let's go get treemail then. <br/>Hmm. Let's do it. <br/>Day 39, you know, I said I would do it, and here I am. I've done it again. <br/>[laughing]: Oh! Oh. [Sandra mumbles] Oh, my God! <br/>Yes! <br/>Look at it! It's amazing! <br/>Sometimes it makes me want to tear up. It really does, because you say you can do it, but it's a lot harder than you  really think. And I've done it, twice-- day 39. <br/>I want a piece of that bread...  Yeah. <br/>...chunked off in my mouth. No one's here to tell us no. We're villains. [Parvati laughs]  Tonight, I believe I have a good shot of winning this. Last season, I brought two people, 'cause I thought I could beat them, 'cause  they were the weak players. And I didn't. <br/>I would like to say congratulations to everybody for making it to the final  three. <br/>I'm bringing people that other people don't like. Parvati has a lot of enemies. Sandra-- she didn't do nothing. At the end of the day, the reason she's here is 'cause she's easy to beat. <br/>I'm going to have to undo my pants. <br/>Oh! <br/>Aah! [Parvati laughs]  Tell me the truth. If I would have been on the jury, would you have voted for me? <br/>I told you, I would have voted for Sandra. <br/>I would have voted for you. If you would have put me on the jury, I still would have vote for you. <br/>That's nice of you. <br/>But you wouldn't have voted for me, really? <br/>I would have voted for Sandra. <br/>No, you... Seriously? <br/>I told you. <br/>Wow. <br/>I have played the game of Survivor for 114 days. I don't know if that makes me crazy. Probably. But I think it also makes me one of the best players of Survivor, ever. <br/>Your game was just like mine,  Your game was just like mine, but mine was a little stronger. but mine was a little stronger. <br/>My game was not like yours, not at all. <br/>Oh, you're gonna hear what I think about it at Tribal. <br/>You say what you want to say. <br/>Yeah, we all say what we got got to say. This is it. Every man for himself now. <br/>I'm definitely a little mischievous, a little devious. I like to get into trouble. So, I definitely have embraced my villain side this time around. And you know what? I've put my heart and soul into this game, and I'm here to win, and that's  what I want. He's so full of himself. <br/>We're gonna lay this bomb on him tonight. He don't know what it's like to be up against two chicks. <br/>Bam! <br/>Ruthless. My God! I'm going to burn his hat. [Parvati laughs]  Oh, my God! [Sandra snorts] Oh, my God, do it! <br/>So he can take his bald-headed ass to be in Tribal Council. [Parvati laughs] Are you gonna tell? <br/>Uh-uh. Are you kidding? [Parvati laughs]  That's how much game I've got. [Parvati laughs]  Good work, lady. <br/>Mm. <br/>Russell is obnoxious, so I took his hat, and I threw it in the fire. I don't care. I should burn his sneakers. [Parvati laughs] He could take his bald-headed tail to Tribal Council. It'll be all right. He can wear his buff on his head. He has a big, bald patch right here, he doesn't want nobody to know about. But we've been here for 39 days. I've seen it a whole ton of times. Screw it. That's payback for everything he's done to me in this game. he's done to me in this game. I don't care. I don't care. <br/>No. <br/>What the hell. Yeah, y'all haven't seen it? <br/>No. Did you pack it? <br/>I put it right there. <br/>Oh. <br/>I know I did. <br/>I don't think it's about the money tonight. I think it's about the title of Sole Survivor. That's all Russell wants. And if that's what Russell wants, that's what I got to make sure Russell does  not get. <br/>I don't get my hat, I ain't leaving, though. <br/>Well, we're going to have to leave. <br/>I don't give a ...  There's not a day that didn't go by that I was trying to focus on, what's the  best way for me to get rid of Russell. <br/>Okay! <br/>And the worst thing of all is that those Heroes, each and every one of them,  are responsible for their own self-destruction. You do it, girl. [whooping] When I was out here, I had to hustle. I had to make sure all my stuff was in order so that when I went to Tribal  Council, I made it out in one piece. I didn't hide behind no immunity necklace. I never had safety. I had to take care of myself. [whoops] Look at it go wild. And yet, here I sit, final three. I think I deserve it. I want the title of Sole Survivor. <br/>Yeah. <br/>The Heroes built it, and the  The Heroes built it, and the Villains burn it down. Villains burn it down. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in your jury. Coach, Courtney, J.T., Amanda, Candice, Danielle, Rupert, Colby, and Jerri,  voted out at Colby, and Jerri, voted out at the last Tribal Council. the last Tribal Council. So, after 39 days, here's where we stand. We started with 20 people-- ten Heroes, ten Villains. We are down to three. Parvati, Russell, Sandra. Each of you having played a very different game of Survivor. Tonight, the jury takes over. Nine people that you had a hand, either directly or indirectly, in voting out  of this game now will decide which one of you wins this game, gets the title  of Sole Survivor, and the million dollars that goes with it. This is their first chance to address you. I hope you're ready for it, because you will be held accountable. And anybody who lasts 39 days in this game will have something to be  accountable for. Here's how it works. You'll make your opening statements. They'll address you, then we vote. Let's start. Sandra. <br/>Okay. I mean, we all know how Survivor works. I've been sole surviving since my alliance was wiped out. I got to the Heroes' camp. I tried to get rid of Russell three different times. I'd have to work my way around things at camp, try to make sure to take all  the precautionary measures to ensure that when I brought my torch in here  lit, that it left here lit. that it left here lit. And I did that by myself. And I did that by myself. <br/>Probst: Russell. <br/>You know, uh, everybody thinks that this game is a game of luck. Some cases, I believe it is. In my case, I don't believe it is. I played as hard as I possibly could play, and for some reason, you know,  when I come here, I feel that people look at me like I did something wrong. You know. I tried to play hard. That's what I did. If I did anything to offend anybody in this game, I apologize. But I played the game. But I played the game. That's all I can say. That's all I can say. <br/>Probst: Parvati. <br/>I came into this game knowing, I was going to play with 20 of the best  survivors ever. What I didn't realize was the threat that I was to everyone in this game. So immediately, I had to put a line of defense together, and that's where  Russell came in. He was, um, the dragon. And instead of slaying him, I kept him as my pet. And he displayed his loyalty at the end to me, and only to me. You know, I think I played the ultimate social game, the ultimate strategic  game and the ultimate physical game. <br/>Probst: All right, jury, in a moment, you'll get your first shot at  addressing these guys. I'm going to give you a moment to get your thoughts, and then, to get your  thoughts, and then, they are all yours. they are all yours. <br/>Probst: All right, jury, it is now your first chance to address Parvati,  Russell, Sandra. You're trying to figure out who's most deserving of winning this game. this game. Colby, get us started. Colby, get us started. <br/>Russell, did you really just say there wasn't any luck involved in getting  you here? <br/>Yeah, I do. I do believe that I got here without any luck. I believe I got here with my strategic play. <br/>Okay, well, I was just double-checking, because you are delusional if you  think you can make it all the way to the end of this game without any luck. Uh, Parvati, tonight, for me, I need to learn a little bit about strategic  plays you made beyond challenges, 'cause you were impressive in the  challenges. But I want to know what makes you more impressive than those two. <br/>Right off the bat, I was the target from the first day. I mean, I'm sitting here against God's plan, basically. I mean, everyone over there wanted me out. J.T. wrote it in the note that he wanted me out, because y'all thought I was  running a girls' alliance. You know, so I feel like I had to fight harder and make some bolder plays. Probably the riskiest move that I made was the day that I had two idols,  because I talked to Amanda to see if I could trust her. Amanda's telling me, "Save yourself. We're going to vote you." I took a huge risk that night, and played the  idol for Jerri. I gave it to Jerri to save her, and I gave one to Sandra to save her, in  order to ensure their loyalty to me for the rest of the game. <br/>Well, good luck, all three of you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Coach, you're up. <br/>Well, the final three Villains. You've got Parvati, the charmer, and also, the manipulator. You've got Russell, the schemer, but also the liar. And you've got Sandra, the coattail rider. We'll start with you, Russell. You can be a very little man in stature and also in word. And the example that you've set here should have been, only the penitent man  shall pass. I think if you came into this Tribal, and you said that you crossed the line,  I think you might be one of the strongest people in the game. Sandra, I've always said I liked taking the strongest to the end, and,  unfortunately, you were fairly useless in challenges. I played with strength, with honor and with integrity. And I wish I could be there in your stead. Parvati, I got to tell you that coming into this game, I was dead wrong about  you-- that you were going to be a weak player in the challenges. You were a warrior in challenges, and I respect that. The ironic twist of fate is, the day that I finally trusted you was the day  that you turned on me. As a Christian man, I give you my word that I came in here tonight without  any preconceived notions of who I was going to vote for, and I will be  watching, listening, and I'll be voting for a million dollars. I have taken that responsibility quite seriously for this game that I love. <br/>Probst: Amanda, you're up. [Amanda sighs]  Hi. Um, Sandra, my question for you is-- tell me how your strategy was better in  the game than Russell and Parvati. <br/>I wish my strategy had been better, because had it been really good, Russell  wouldn't be sitting here. You don't know how many nights I spent trying my hardest. "How can I get Russell out of this game?" And what happened was,  every time I went to a Hero, I was, like, "I can't believe these people  don't want Russell out." And he's taking them out one by one, and every  time I go and try to do something, they run back to Russell. It was crazy. <br/>So did that strategy work for you? <br/>It didn't work for me. It just never panned out. I could never get Heroes on my side. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Courtney, you're up. <br/>Probst: Courtney, you're up. <br/>Well, hello, Villains. Congratulations, especially my two Villainesses. Very proud of you both. Parvati, I know you played a, you know, a good game. I'm really proud of you. Athletic as hell, great. And then there's my girl, Sandra. You're loyal as hell, and I think that that's often overlooked, especially in  a game like this. And I want to give you an opportunity to defend something that people view as  weakness, when really it's an amazing strength that you take, and you took  all the way to end of Pearl Islands, and you took all the way to the end this  time. <br/>It's true. When I pick somebody that I'm going to be loyal to, I'm loyal to them till the  end. I was loyal to Courtney from the beginning, and she knows that I protected  her. Every time I heard anything bad about Courtney, I go bananas, and I was,  like, "Courtney, you ain't going nowhere. They ain't doing this to you, nothing." If I tell you I got your back, I  got your back. And if something is wrong, I'm gonna confront you. I'm looking out for you, you should be looking out for me, but if you ain't,  we need to split. That's it. I love you girl. <br/>I love you, girl. <br/>All right. <br/>Probst: You're good? <br/>Done. <br/>Probst: Take a seat. <br/>Thanks, Jeffrey. <br/>Thanks, Jeffrey. <br/>Probst: J.T., you're up. <br/>Probst: J.T., you're up. <br/>Russell, I guess I ought to talk to you first, old buddy. Good strategy is getting to the end of the game, then winning the game. Getting to the end of the game is half of it. The people you voted out-- do you think you've done well at preserving their  vote for yourself at the end of the game? <br/>I really, seriously, believe that everybody on the jury is going to respect  my game play, especially this group of people that's played the game before  and knows how hard it is to play the game. And I might not get anybody's vote, but I have to stick to what's going to  get me here, and then hopefully, the jury will respect the way I played the  game. <br/>How do you think you've done, Parvati? <br/>Um, I think... I love Sandra. I think the difference between our game was that I was a huge threat from day  one. Sandra was kind of a sleeper. Like, she gave 50, 60% in the challenges. So post-merge, no one thought about voting Sandra off. I had to work in those challenges, because everyone was trying to vote me out. <br/>Sandra, did you only give 50 or 60% of the challenges? <br/>No, no. No. Here's the deal. When it came to the challenges, I gave 110%, but I'm not a physical person,  right? But...  I know that. <br/>And you know what I want to tell you, too? I wish I would have known that you were going to throw that thing in his bag,  'cause if I could have intercepted that thing, I would have threw it right  back to you, and told you, "Don't do this. You don't know what you're doing."  Me, too. <br/>I mean, I wish...  I'm not sour about me going out of the game. I made my bed, I can lay in it. Russell, I shook your hand before I left that night. I'm not out for vengeance, so so let's be clear on that. <br/>Yeah, that's what I'm hoping for. No matter what happens today, I sit here, and everybody looks at me like I'm  the devil. You know, I am playing the game, and I'm playing it hard. <br/>Hey, I'm laying in my bed, partner. Lay in yours. <br/>But I want to be able to...  Lay in your bed like I'm laying in mine...  Yeah, but what I want to do is, you know, be cool afterwards. <br/>Are you through saying...? Thank y'all. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Danielle, you're up. <br/>Well, well, well, Villains, Hello! Hello! Um, congrats to all three of you guys. Russell, it's clear that there's been a lack of skill in your jury management. That being said, what you've heard from all of these people thus far-- would you  change anything about your game now? <br/>You know, I don't regret anything that I played, 'cause if I don't play like  that, there's no way I'd be here. If that's what you want me to say, I'm not gonna say that. <br/>No. Would you change anything? <br/>I'm not going to sit here and tell you what you want to hear. I'm going to tell you what... the truth, and I wouldn't change. <br/>But after hearing what all of these people have said, how you... You're not  going to get any votes! Nobody respects the way that you played the game, Russell. <br/>I wouldn't change anything, and I don't regret it. <br/>Okay. That's too bad. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Danielle. Jerri. <br/>Hi. [laughs] I am absolutely 100% undecided who to vote for. Absolutely 100%. So I'm going to start with you, Russell. Right after you win the immunity necklace, the plan was, get rid of Parvati  and take me to the end. So carry on from that moment and tell me what happened. <br/>You know, uh, right after I won the immunity necklace, that was the plan. And all day, I thought about it, and I thought that it would be a bad  strategic move by me to take you, because you didn't do anything to anybody  on the jury, and if you were sitting next to me, in my mind, you would have  won. <br/>Can I tell you what he told me? <br/>And... yeah, I was just going to say, Parvati, your story? Because we never talked, so...  The reason that he told me that you were leaving is because 100%, he knew he  was getting your vote. He wanted you on the jury, 100%. He knows he's getting your vote tonight. <br/>And it makes sense. <br/>You know what they say about assuming. <br/>Makes an ass out of you and me. <br/>Exactly. So, uh, Sandra, you know, I hear you tell everybody how honest you are with  people, and how you... When you say you're looking out for somebody, you look  out for them, but I still got blindsided, so you didn't really do that for me. It's tough. I got to say, it is a tough decision. But, um, I appreciate the insights. Thank you. <br/>Probst: Candice, you're up. <br/>Congratulations, Final Three, for making it here. Russell, you know, you have to tell lies in this game, but you can go too far. You told dirty lies-- lies that you didn't need to tell. And you hurt people doing that. Parvati, you kind of played this game under Russell's thumb the whole time,  like a spouse in a bad, abusive relationship, you know, and you never got out  of it. I wanted you to get out. I wanted it so bad for you, but you never did. I like you, but I can't support that. As tough as this game is, it really comes down to how you treat people. That's what I'm basing my vote on. It's not just what you stand for. It's what you fall for, too. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Candice. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Candice. All right, Rupert, you're up. All right, Rupert, you're up. <br/>Russell, I want to start with you. To be honest in this game is a very hard thing. To be a manipulative, deceiving, lying person is very easy. You took the easy way out. And if you think you should be proud of how you got here, you're sadly  mistaken. Sandra, sitting here listening to your answers makes me feel even worse about  my game play. I wish you and I had talked more, but I had been swayed by what I consider a  disgusting human being. You opened the door up for us, and we kept slamming it in your face. I want to say thank you, for all the Heroes. Whether they give you their vote or not, you deserve a big thank you. <br/>You're welcome. Look, don't make me emotional. <br/>Parvati, you're a very, very strong player. You might have aligned yourself with... Terrible. <br/>I didn't have a choice. No one else would align with me. It was day one, and seven people on my tribe wanted me out. <br/>But I want to say, you, as well as Sandra, deserve the vote, because you  worked to get here. I went up against you in those challenges. You fought to be sitting right there, and you deserve to be in the final  three. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Rupert. Jury, great final Tribal Council. A lot of information has come out. I'm going to give you guys a moment to take all of it in, sort through your thoughts. Then we'll come back and make a Then we'll come back and make a  million-dollar vote. million-dollar vote. <br/>Probst: All right, jury, you've heard from Parvati, Russell and Sandra. You've had a chance to address them. You should have all the information you need to decide who's most deserving  of the title of the Sole Survivor and the million dollars that goes along  with it. Tonight you are voting for a winner. For the last time, it's time to vote. vote. Jerri, you're up. Jerri, you're up. <br/>This is absolutely insane. I'm walking up here going, "Parvati, Sandra, Parvati, Sandra."  Sandra." I... am perplexed. I... am perplexed. <br/>Sandra, in this game, the line between hero and villain was blurred most of  the time, but you work hard, you put family first, and you always stay true  to yourself, and that stay true to yourself, and that makes you a true hero  to me. makes you a true hero to me. <br/>Hey, girl, I'm voting for you. I know everything that you had to go through dealing with Russell and all,  but you are a great player. I thought you deserved to be I thought you deserved to be sitting in the  final three. sitting in the final three. <br/>Parvati, I was wrong about you. You were a warrior, and that is You were a warrior, and that is why you get  my vote. why you get my vote. King Arthur's journey has King Arthur's journey has officially ended. officially ended. <br/>I'm honored that I get to write your name down again and give you a million  dollars. give you a million dollars. Love you. Love you. <br/>Probst: For the last time,  Probst: For the last time, I'll go get the votes. I'll go get the votes. Well, I want to say that we couldn't have asked for a better group of people  to play in this twentieth season of Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains. Thank you. Parvati, Russell, Sandra-- the nine votes inside this urn are about to make  one of you a millionaire, but you're going to have to wait just a little bit  longer. I'll see you back in New York I'll see you back in New York for the reading  of the votes. for the reading of the votes. for the reading of the votes. [applause and cheering] [applause and cheering]  Probst: All right! [applause and cheering] Thanks for the welcome. Let's get to this. You know, I just said this a moment ago, but it was months ago when I said it. And now that the season has aired, and I've had a chance to listen to the  fans tell me, literally on a daily basis, the consensus is really clear to me  that this is one of, if not, the greatest season we've ever had on Survivor. [cheering and applause] [cheering and applause] So, kudos to you guys. So, kudos to you guys. Very tough game. There's a lot... There are a lot of reality shows. There is no show like this that forces you guys to live in these elements and  compete with the mental challenges that go on, on a daily basis. But now it comes down to this-- three people in this Heroes vs. Villains season-- all Villains-- Parvati, Russell, Sandra. And nine votes from your jury. The jury has spoken.
