<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," at the Hero  tribe, Chrissy was running the show with ben. <br/>We're in the prime position. <br/>Jeff: While Ashley and Alan were butting heads. <br/>Are we strong or not? <br/>Dude, you are tripping. <br/>Jeff: At the Healer tribe, Jessica and Cole were loving  life and sharing secrets. <br/>Joe has the idol. <br/>Jeff: At the Hustler tribe, Patrick and Lauren went after  each other. <br/>I’m assuming you'll try  to vote me out tonight. <br/>Jeff: And at tribal council, Patrick lost the battle. Patrick, the tribe has spoken. 15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! Heroes and Healers getting your first look at the new Hustler  tribe. Patrick voted out at the last tribal council. All right. You guys ready to get to it? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Everybody, drop your buffs. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: We're switching tribes. <br/>Wow. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: I’m going to hand you buffs. <br/>It's day nine, and we were all starting to get a little  bit comfortable, but when Jeff says, "Drop your buff," all of that  gets erased, and it's a brand-new game. <br/>Drew: All right. Shall we? Everybody reveal. Once you find your color, take a spot on the mat. Bring you stuff with you and say hello to your new tribe mates. <br/>Oh, my God. Bye, guys. <br/>I instantly looked over  at Cole and saw that I had a red buff and he had a red buff, too. My palms were sweating, my heart was racing. It was awesome. <br/>Welcome, Ryan. <br/>Jeff: Wow. Big mix-up. Let's start with our first tribe. We have two Heroes together with Ashley and Alan, two Healers  withyDesi and Joe, and one Hustler with Devon. Desi, what do you make of this new tribe? <br/>Looking around, I don't think we fared too badly. The swapped worked out really well for me. We have three of the strongest men, and Ashley I know is a super  strong swimmer. I think we're in a great situation. Physically I don't think there's a reason we couldn't dominate. <br/>Jeff: Okay, next group, we have two Hustlers with Ryan and  Ali, two Heroes, Chrissy and JP, Roark, you're the odd person out on this  tribe. Concerns or is that a opportunity? <br/>I think it's fair to say  both. I just don't know. I'm excited to introduce these people to the beach. I hope we can all be friends. <br/>Jeff: Go to our last tribe. We have three Healers with Jessica, dr. Mike, and Cole, one Hustler with Lauren, one Hero with ben. Ben, what does this feel like, because you were on a dominant  tribe doing very well. Now you're a lone soldier out here with a group of new people. <br/>Yes, sir. It looks pretty bad for me, and what was you name again? <br/>Lauren. <br/>Lauren. We walked over here. Open arms. They gave us all hugs. I think we'll do all right. <br/>Being split up from Chrissy, that's a shot in the foot. Things were well-oiled and greased and we were moving. I'm going to have to put some work inch I’m not just going to  roll over and die, but my odds at this point are real low to move forward. I'm scared. <br/>Jeff: All right. We have three new tribes. The big question is how well will you work together? Why not right now for your first reward challenge. Are you ready? <br/>Let's do it, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, three members of each tribe  will be attached to a braided rope. On my go you'll work together to untangle that rope. Once you're completely separated, you'll use the rope to hook a  sled and pull it back to you where the two remaining tribe members will use  the pieces on top to solve an upright puzzle. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Peanut butter and jelly banana. <br/>I knew it! I knew it! [applause]  Jeff: Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to eat right  away, and enough peanut butter, jelly, and bread to make sandwiches for a  while, plus an individual back of potato chips for each player. One more thing, this is a winner-take-all challenge. No second place. Take a minute to strategize. We'll get started. All right. Here we go. First reward challenge as a new tribe. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Let's go, guys. <br/>Jeff: Lots of new groups. We have Alan and Ashley who have worked together but don't know Joe. For Soko we have Ryan, Roark, and JP Nobody knows anybody. And we have Cole, ben, and Lauren, where nobody knows anybody. So the first stage of this challenge is going to come down to  how well groups of strangers can learn to communicate very fast. <br/>Me over you? <br/>Step over. <br/>Nope, nope, nope, nope. <br/>Jeff: Lots of talk with Soko. <br/>Okay, okay. <br/>Jeff: Ben, Lauren, and Cole are moving faster by the  second. They've really got a rhythm going. Now you got to get over and under. Now the yow oo tribe in red in the early lead. <br/>Guys, you're ahead. <br/>Jeff: The Soko tribe in yellow trying to catch up. They're free. Now you have to get over and under. Joe, Alan, and Ashley struggle. <br/>Pop over to the other side, Joe. <br/>On the right side. <br/>Jeff: Roark launches herself over. Ben throws himself over. Everybody getting physical now on "Survivor."  Good job, good job, one more flip. <br/>Jeff: Moving on to the third and final section. Soko is moving on to this third phase of the untangling. It is still yowa in the lead. JP, Roark, and Ryan doing a great job of working together,  slowly catching yowa. <br/>You're almost there. <br/>You're almost there. Come on! <br/>Jeff: And once again Alan, Ashley, and Joe struggle to get  a rhythm. <br/>All right. You got to move a little bit faster. <br/>Jeff: It's JP And Ben side by side trying to get over that last bit of rope. JP Launching himself. Go one person. Soko now in the lead. Now you're trying to hook that sled. Ben is over now. Red can go. You did all this work to untangle the rope. Now you're going to use it to bring those pieces to the two  remaining tribe members. Alan, Joe, and Ashley are exhausted. Nothing easy about this challenge. All tangled up with the rope now. All that effort and we are now back to even. Yowa lassos it. They are back in the lead now. This is heavy, and it's taking three people a lot of effort. You're good. Take over, puzzle solvers. Jessica and dr. Mike working on that puzzle while JP Continues the try the hook the sled for Soko. Alan now in for Levu. It is an upright puzzle, not easy to solve. Jessica and dr. Mike have been together in this game from day one. It would same they would have an advantage in terms of  communicating. <br/>Focus on the end. <br/>Jeff: JP Launches and he has it. You got to pull. It is heavy. <br/>Together. On three, one, two, three! <br/>Jeff: Ryan giving everything he. Can it requires all their muscle. <br/>One, two, three, pull! <br/>Jeff: You're good. Go, puzzle solvers. You guys are done. It's now Chrissy and Ali quickly trying to make up ground. Alan now feeling the pressure. They have no shot without those puzzle pieces. Can't get it to hook. Jessica and dr. Mike have a big time advantage. But Chrissy and Ali are not messing around. They don't know each other, but they're working together  quickly. <br/>Move this, move this, and move this. <br/>Jeff: Yowa continues to move forward. <br/>I’m getting it. <br/>Jeff: Alan falls short again. Is this a sign of the new Levu tribe? <br/>Do you want somebody else to try? <br/>Let me get one more. <br/>Jeff: Jessica and dr. Mike continue to make progress as Mike smashes Jessica's  fingers. <br/>I’m sorry. <br/>Jeff: It would be a huge comeback for Soko if they could  pull this out. Dr. Mike and Jessica arguing. Ali and Chrissy are working together trying to close that gap. <br/>That's it, that's it. <br/>Jeff: Dr. Mike makes a change. <br/>We have it. <br/>Jeff: Jessica makes another change. Is this right? This would be a huge reward, biggest of the season. They think they have it, and they do! Yowa wins reward! Peanut butter and jelly bonanza. Yowa, congratulation, nice way to welcome in a new tribe. Big reward. Grab your stuff, head back to camp, enjoy the afternoon. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Jeff: Soko, Levu, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp, spend the afternoon getting  to know each other. <br/>Now that the Heroes and the Healers and the Hustlers are  all switched up, the game has stepped up a level. You have to perform. <br/>Nice. <br/>This is awesome. <br/>First initial impression of this tribe swap, there's a  little bit of comfort in our tribe knowing that we work well together and won  that pb&amp;j. But three Healers, one Hustler, and a Hero, that's target pinned  right on my tail. So I have to earn respect around here and gain trust to keep my  butt in the game. <br/>Obviously us three know each other pretty well. My name is Cole. I'm from arkansas originally. But I've been living in wyoming. <br/>The whole tribe is getting to know each other. I look in my chip bag and I see to my surprise the word  "Secret advantage." it looked like a big chip. I almost just ate it. I'm like, well, that would have been awful. I probably stared at it a little too wrong. And then I realized. Jessica, you're staring at your chips too long. And so then I rolled it up until I can get a better read of it. <br/>Chrissy seems so nice. <br/>Chrissy is really nice. <br/>And Alan looks like he can be a hothead. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Right now I feel like I have a . Of power. I have the opportunity to block another player's vote at the  next tribal council. "If you win immunity and do not go to tribal council, you  must send this to someone on the losing tribe." oh, my goodness. I can only imagine what kind of chaos this could cause when it's  actually used. So I feel lucky that I found it. Somebody's angel. Here you go, my friend. Hey, I found a secret advantage in my chip bag. <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah. Long story short, if we go the tribal council, I can block someone's  vote so it doesn't count. But it has to be used as the next tribal council. <br/>Jessica just gave me a huge piece of knowledge. Knowledge is power in Survivor, but I shared with Jessica that Joe  had an idol. Instantly her next reaction was to give me a hug, kiss me on the  cheek, and say I trust you now, Cole. I plan the use that same method with other people. <br/>So I'll share a secret with you. Jessica has an advantage, and it cancels out one of you all's  votes. <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah. Jessica's secret sounds like my olive branch. I can extend this information and maybe they'll see me as more  trustworthy because I've chosen to tell them something that I had no only  gigs to -- obligation to tell them in the first place. So Jessica's got an advantage in her bag of potato chips. <br/>How can you believe that? <br/>Supposedly Jessica got an advantage in the bottom of her  chip bag, which is odd that Cole told us that. It could be that Cole was just telling myself and Ben to make us  believe in him, and if he is, that's great, but I'd rather just put my faith  in my own hands. So I will be using your little secret to my advantage. <br/>I can't believe this  beach. <br/>What was your beach like? <br/>Not like this. <br/>Not pretty. <br/>The new Soko is myself, JP, and Chrissy from the Heroes. And Ryan and Ali from the Hustlers. I pretty much went from the tribe of six Healers who were super  tight to the lone Healer of Soko beach. So we only slept in here the night it rained. <br/>We definitely slept in our shelter. <br/>The swap brings such act dayty, but I’m very lucky that Chrissy  was swapped on the my tribe because I awarded her the super immunity idol  that I found on the boat day one, and I ensured her she would not be the one  going home that night, so I have an in. I just think it's cool that you're from jersey. <br/>I know. <br/>I think we'll be friends. <br/>I think so, too. I was glad to see you. <br/>You know, I'll tell you something, so I found an advantage  on day one on the boat, okay, and that advantage was I could save someone at  the first tribal council. <br/>I know why you're telling  me this obviously. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Thank you. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>Why did you pick me? <br/>I just had a good vibe,  and I wanted really to play the game with you. <br/>I felt very loved when I got  it. <br/>Well, it was easy to give to you. <br/>That is so nice. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>Thank you so much. <br/>Ryan blew my mind. He totally gave me the super idol and seriously made me feel so  loved. I thought, what was it about me on that ship that he looked over  and thought that I looked like a kind person that he wanted to play this game  with. Maybe he thought I was like his mother an he wanted to play the  game with his mother. I don't know. I give you my word, I hate to say pay you back, but you know  what I mean. <br/>I gotcha. <br/>I am absolutely thrilled. I feel very, very secure, because now I have one more person who  can help me get further in this game. <br/>Welcome home. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Desi. <br/>Joe. <br/>Ashley. <br/>Hey, gorgeous. <br/>Right now we've got two Heroes. We have Alan and Ashley, two Healers, me and Joe, and then we've  got I think the strongest of all the Hustlers in Devon in the middle. <br/>Thanks for being so welcoming. It would be easy for the four of us to throw Devon out, but I'd  rather work with him because he's potentially the swing boat. <br/>How you feeling? <br/>If there was one person out of all three tribes that I did  not want on my new tribe, that would have been alex. He's proven to be this wild car. He'll call you out and three your name under the bus. He's already done it to me. I was really nervous. <br/>I know I got history with  you. <br/>Yeah, all this stuff between me and you, doesn't matter. That was last chapter. Luckily I think Alan is as nervous as I am. So even though I don't trust him, I do trust that he doesn't  want to go home. <br/>I gotcha. <br/>Ben, where is your head at right now? <br/>I’m just trying the get  further in this game. I loved my tribe. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Thanks to the swap, it's a whole new game. When I was with the Healers, we won every challenge, so I had no  worries. But now I’m not as confident. It's true, I do have an idol, but I’m not taking any chances. Devon is a swing vote, and I want him on my side. The thing is, they kind of like said, why don't we take them. I may be Healer, but I’m also a strategic player. I said, listen, Devon, they want to vote you out, but I made it  up. I don't care. This is a game of being deceitful, so I want to do what I have  to do. <br/>Was it beth of them or just Alan? <br/>Both. <br/>I don't know if I can  really trust Joe, but this is the first time that I've felt like, shoot, I might  be going home next. So I got to figure out my next move or I feel like I could be in  big trouble. <br/>I thought we were all  going out there. I don't know. I just think it's funny that every time you see them, they're  like this. Ben and I are a little outnumbered here. The only way the really gain a little bit of control would be to  get dr. Mike to join us. So if dr. Mike doesn't know that Jessica got the advantage, I’m going to  use that against those two. Do you think there was an advantage yesterday? <br/>I don't know. That's a good question. I hadn't thought about it. Like where would it have been. It would have been in the basket. <br/>Yeah, I don't know. I heard there was one in a chip bag yesterday, and I didn't get  it. You didn't get it, and he didn't get it. And you don't know about it. Do you know what I’m saying? <br/>So Lauren says there's an advantage in the game, which  clearly somebody from my tribe has then told her. It is clear to me it's Cole, because Cole sometimes can't keep  his mouth closed. And those things come back the bite you in the butt. <br/>Hey, if you guys are playing me...  What are you talking about? <br/>They know about your advantage? <br/>They know about my advantage? When he said they know about the secret advantage, everything in  my crashed, because only two people knew, Cole, and Mike. So one of them opened their mouth. <br/>Did you tell Lauren about the advantage? <br/>She's like, Mike, there's an advantage in her potato  chips. <br/>How would she know about that. <br/>In my head I’m like crap, crap, crap, crap, crap. Jessica is going the look at me and think, Cole, you betrayed  me. <br/>Either you or him told Lauren. I didn't tell Lauren. <br/>I certainly wouldn't have  gone and told Lauren. That's there's no benefit to tell her. <br/>Somebody told her. <br/>I’m so sorry. I mentioned it to ben. I thought it would extend trust to him. <br/>Colburned me bad. He can't even keep a secret for a day. <br/>The same reason I told you about the idol. <br/>Cole, but you have to protect that knowledge a little bit. It's my prerogative on who I tell what I have, you know? You hurt me. Whether he meant to or not, he did. But I would never admit that to him. When I get hurt, I always wonder, was it me, and did I choose to  form a relationship with someone that I just shouldn't have? And that's why I got hurt. That's how I feel now with Cole. Did I make a poor decision from the beginning, and how do I move  forward in this game thinking that? So, yeah, I had to swallow that. It hurts. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! All right. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Jeff: First things first, take back the idols. Roark. <br/>You're welcome. <br/>Jeff: Ashley. Once again immunity back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to race out to a large crate  of puzzle piecings and maneuver that crate through a table obstacle and under  a net. Once you reach the finish, you'll unlock your second set of  puzzle pieces. You'll then arrange those pieces so each intersection is the  same color. First two tribes to finish win immunity, safe from the vote. Losers, tribal council where somebody will be the fourth person  voted out of this game. Take a minute the strategize. We'll get started. Do it. All right. Here we go. For immunity, Survivors ready? Go! That crate of puzzle pieces is heavy. And already Yawa feels the weight of it. You now have to maneuver it through a table obstacle. The big question is: Are your tribe mates helping you, or are  they throwing a monkey wrench intooff plans? <br/>Go back. <br/>You, you, you. Me, me, me. <br/>Jeff: It's very close. Another hot day in fiji. My poor brain is fried. It's Levu through first. Now you're on to the net. Yellow are right on their tail. <br/>Come on! <br/>Come on, come on, come on. Ready? Here comes Soko. They're entering the second phase of this challenge. Now is when it gets dirty and hard. You have to work together. <br/>One, two, go. <br/>Jeff: Levu doing a nice job together. Yawa doing a great job. Yawa now in the lead. It is now Soko that is struggling to get through this. These crates weigh a ton. Yawa is through first. They won the first challenge. They would love to win the second and send a signal. <br/>Got it, got it, got it. <br/>Jeff: Levu trying to get through. Levu through. Yawa is untying their puzzle pieces. Levu right on their tail. <br/>Yank 'em, yank 'em. <br/>Jeff: Here comes Soko. <br/>Yank 'em. <br/>Jeff: Immunity on the line. You do not want to go home tonight. <br/>Go. Go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: It's now Lauren on the keys for Yawa. You have to find the right keys for both blocks. Ashley on the keys for Levu. Soko taking up a lot of time. Chrissy now on the locks for Soko. <br/>Guys, guys, guys. <br/>Jeff: Lauren has the second lock and the pieces are free  now for her tribe to start working on the puzzle. Out of nowhere Chrissy has the second lock for Soko. Go! You guys are good. Ashley still working on the locks for Levu. <br/>You got it, ash. <br/>Jeff: You are looking for both color and the shape. <br/>This one. <br/>We got to flip that one. <br/>Jeff: They have the line up at the crosses with the same  color. Ashley struggling with the locks for Levu. <br/>It's if last one. <br/>Jeff: In times like these, you need a little luck. <br/>It's the last one. <br/>All right. We're good. <br/>Jeff: Good job, ash. Ashley has the second lock. Ashley's work is done. <br/>I do not think that is  right. There are no two ends that are red. <br/>Jeff: Where the pieces intersect, the colors must match. You must finish however long it takes, otherwise it is a  listening road to ruin at tribal council. <br/>I’m lost. I'm loves. <br/>Jeff: Levu is having trouble. <br/>"Right decisions," right here. <br/>Red, purple. Switch 'em, switch 'em, switch 'em. <br/>Jeff: Yellow thinks they have something. <br/>This is not right. <br/>That's in the right. <br/>Jeff: Something is not right for Soko. They got to rethink it. <br/>Guys, over here. That one is over here. That one is over here! <br/>Yes, yes! <br/>Jeff: We're flat. Are we flat? Yawa thinks they have it, and they do. Yawa wins immunity, safe from tribal. Looking for one more. <br/>Come on, come on. Hurry. <br/>Jeff: Levu doing a nice job. We are neck and neck right now. It's a race to the finish. <br/>This is yellow, white, yellow. <br/>Jeff: Soko put the last piece. If they're right, Soko thinks they have it. And they do. Soko wins immunity, safe from tribal council. Somebody from Levu will be the fourth person voted out of this  game. <br/>Unbelievable. <br/>Jeff: Yawa, congratulations. Immunity is yours. <br/>Thank you, sir. <br/>Jeff: Nobody going home from you tribe. Soko, congratulations. Immunity is yours. Nobody going home from Soko. Yawa, Soko, grab your stuff, head back to camp. No tribal tonight. All right, Levu. Somebody going home tonight, somebody will be the fourth person voted  out of "Survivor: Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers." grab you stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>Tonight I have the opportunity to block a Levu player who  votes at tribal council. The goal is to help the Healers, so I’m going to disrupt the Levu  tribe as much as I can. <br/>The keys were such luck. <br/>We just couldn't do the puzzle. <br/>It was the very last one I tried. <br/>Don't even worry about that. I think everyone was just on their own page instead of working  together. <br/>We lost again. It was deflating. So you got me and ash, you got Desi and Joe, and then you got Devon. No question Devon is a swing vote, and whoever he goes with is  going to come out on top. <br/>Devon, I don't want you to think that because you're the  odd one out you'd be target, because the Healers need to go. <br/>Listen, are you telling the truth right now? <br/>100%? Yeah. <br/>Okay. Because Joe told me that you want to vote me out. <br/>Really? That's [bleeped]. We don't want you to go. It makes no sense. <br/>All right. You guys didn't even consider that? <br/>Not even for a second. <br/>All right. Wow. That is scary. To pull something like that. What a sketchy dude. <br/>When Joe told me that Ashley wanted to vote me out, I had  a gut feeling when they're going me that whole pitch, I felt like I was being  talked to by a car salesman. I was like, this might be a lie. And now I think it was. <br/>He's a player. <br/>That's why I like talking to you. You seem the most honest. I think I can trust ash. Alsoian -- Alan seems like a straightforward guy. Joe is a snake, and I don't like having snakes around. <br/>Oh, my God. Let's do it. <br/>All right. <br/>Jeff: That just made me so  I saw Ashley and Devon in  the water. I'm not sure what they said, but at the end of it, they hugged. <br/>Really? <br/>It looks like Devon could be playing me. I think he has this emotional connection with Ashley. He's a surfer dude. And Ashley is all about the beach. So I don't feel confident. <br/>He's going to come after me first. I'm going to have to play the idol, but if I play it tonight and  they vote out Desi, then I just wasted an idol and I’m next, so if I’m going  to get one of them out, I have to make sure they vote for me. <br/>So is this the part that we just act like everything's  cool, or...  What do you mean? <br/>I’m just saying, we're  going the tribal tonight. I've been in this game for 11 games. I don't know who is part of my alliance. I want to know, we're going to move forward as a strong tribe,  or we're going to go back to, all right, so we started off yellow or we  started off blue. <br/>Somebody got to go home tonight, bro. <br/>That's what I’m saying, are we not going to acknowledge. <br/>It's acknowledged. Somebody is going home tonight. <br/>I understand that, but  we're not going to talk about it at all. <br/>Who do you think should go home? You brought it up and everybody got to vote. Who you voting for in. <br/>All right. Let's talk about it. We had two challenges. We lost both challenges. So how do we move forward stronger than we are right now? <br/>What do you think is going to make us stronger? <br/>I don't mind, I'll put my  vote out there. I'm voting for Ashley. I think the strongest four is us four. <br/>Joe wants to talk about who we're getting rid of, and, of  course, it's my name that comes up. <br/>What makes Desi stronger than Ashley? <br/>Please. <br/>I think Desi's stronger  in puzzles. <br/>How? <br/>What do you mean how? <br/>There's always a puzzle. You're not good at puzzles. <br/>This is total bull crap. I don't think I’m the weakest link by any means. He has to know the more he pisses people off, the more people  want to get rid of him. <br/>I’m not voting for Ashley  or Desi. <br/>Fair enough. <br/>So I guess our name is on the chopping block. <br/>Let your man do the math. <br/>Joe just blew up camp and in the process he blew up both  of our games. <br/>You just blew your whole spot up. <br/>You'll see tonight. You all my be surprised tonight. I guarantee you that. <br/>That was an idiotic move. Now my name is on the chopping block. I'm just pissed off and already devastated and I haven't even  got to tribal council. <br/>She's probably upset, but I had to get the target off you  somehow. <br/>Listen, I have an idol, okay, so trust me. The far get is on my back. <br/>No, it's not, because you came in too confidently. Now they're going to assume you have the idol. <br/>Trust me, you can't think like that. You don't know how...  Then play the idol for me. <br/>What? <br/>You play the id.L. On me and then I got you from here on out, but at this point in  time, you just through me under the bus. <br/>I kind of screwed up, you  know, I wanted to start chaos, and I did, but it kind of backfired a little  bit, because now Desi's nervous they might voted for her. I was like, crap. So what do you want to do? I'm telling you, I’m willing to give you the idol, because if I don't  have you, I don't have anything. So me giving you the idol is an extra three days for us to find  some crack. It's easy of me to work crabs together by myself. <br/>Give me a name, I'll write it down. <br/>They're both writing my name down? <br/>To be honest, you should worry, if you have an idol,  they're writing my name down. <br/>They're writing my name down. <br/>Now everything is up in the air. If he pulls out the idol, one of us are going home. He may have an idol. She may have an idol. <br/>We have to pick one. <br/>Secret advantage, do not open until it is time to vote. No way! We're about the go to tribal, and I discover in my bag a secret  advantage. If I have a secret admirer, that is a beautiful thing. It could be an extra vote. It could be anything, like I have no idea. But with that and being the swing vote, I have all of the power  in my hands. Power in my hands. <br/>Jeff: For those of you who haven't been to tribal yet,  grab a torch. Get fire. This is part of the ritual at tribal council because in this  game, fire represents your life. When your fire is gone, so are you. All right. So Alan, off the a tough start as a new tribe. Wait, we haven't even started and the look on your face is  disgust. <br/>It's been a long day. <br/>Jeff: Let's get into it. What happened? <br/>We got back the camp and things sparked off. Some people were a little anxious to get tribal started. <br/>Well, we came from a loss, and I wanted to discuss it. And unlike Alan, I just speak my mind. Alan got upset and he's like, you need the calm down, you're  upset. I wasn't upset. I just wanted to discuss it. So I threw Ashley's name out there. <br/>Jeff: Ashley, you could not have liked being referred to. <br/>Jeff, I have never been referred to the weakest link. Me had to pick someone. He went for the easiest tribes. His actions or his words might affect him tonight. <br/>Jeff: Desi, that was a really honest statement. <br/>Yeah. I didn't expect that out of Joe. Names were thrown out. And part of what happened was I got thrown under the bus in the  process. <br/>Jeff: Alan, is Desi's concern fair based on what happened  at camp? <br/>Absolutely. Especially when you bring in things like talk of an idol. I'm going to be quite frank, by vote is between her and Joe. <br/>Jeff: Joe, this is like a movie. <br/>It's better than a movie. <br/>Jeff: It's like that moment where they want to get the bad  guy, so they get the bad guy by getting his wife. <br/>That's not what I wanted at all, but on the flip side I got  a lot of information from Alan knowing he's supporting Ashley. His divide was made by him. So thank you, Alan, I appreciate it. <br/>Jeff: Wow. Devon. Really interesting for you, because when you first had the  switch, you could argue, I’m the odd person out, and now it sounds like we  have two Healers, two Hero, and you sitting in the middle. <br/>Yeah, it's out in the open that I am the swing vote. And my vote is based on who do I think I can work with and move  forward with in this game. <br/>Jeff: So, Joe, this is a real showdown. <br/>Yeah. I mean, Alan wants me out because I’m not a Hero. I'm not good for his game. I'm sure she's not good for his game because we're not Heroes. You can't Ben trait the Hero, so why let the Heroes stay around  when there's no cracks. Long-term you need to get rid of them. It's that simple. <br/>He says the Heroes can't be broken. The Healers were undefeated. If you do the numbers, do you want to be at the bottom of seven? Joe was the person hanging off the cliff that you see each  finger peeling off because he's scratching and clawing at whatever he can. <br/>Jeff: Devon, if everybody here is ready to lay on the  sword for their partner, the pressure on you is enormous to make the move  that moves you forward. <br/>Well, every decision I have made has been, is this going  to further my game, and my decision is going the stay the same every tribal  council I attend. <br/>What's good for you? <br/>Jeff: It sounds like we have a showdown about the happen. It is time to vote. <br/>Jeff, I got a little something. It says "Do not open until it is time to vote," which  is right now. <br/>Jeff: Go for it. <br/>I’m very curious. <br/>Jeff: I think everybody else is really curious, too. <br/>Okay. It reads, "This is a secret advantage, but it is being used  against you by another player to block your vote at tonight's tribal council."  that is not an advantage. <br/>Jeff: Devon, just to make sure we're clear, that advantage  is being used to block you from voting, meaning Devon can till be voted out,  he just won't vote. Everybody else votes, and you can vote for anybody. Does that make sense? All right. Time to vote? Joe, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. <br/>I got something for you, Jeff. Can I keep it for myself or give it to somebody? <br/>Jeff: Yes. <br/>All right. So I'll keep it for myself. <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. Any votes cast for Joe will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote Joe. Does not count. Joe. Does not count. Alan. That's one vote Alan. Fourth person voted out, Alan. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Detroit, holler back, baby. <br/>You got it. <br/>I read your face. Thank you, girl. <br/>Jeff: Alan, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. <br/>Bye, Alan. <br/>That was crazy. What the hell just happened? <br/>Jeff: Well, one of the great truths about "Survivor,"  you can have all the plans you want, "Survivor" Gods don't care. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. Captioned by media access group at wgbh  Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor," to win you have  to get dirty -- that is how you do it right here -- be ruthless. <br/>She wants to do an all-girl alliance. <br/>Oh, she's got to go. <br/>Jeff: And have a willingness to risk it all. <br/>It's 2-2. <br/>We are in this together. The next vote is going to rock. <br/>I don't know where Devon  came up with this thing or what he pulled, but it fell apart. I blame a lot of my fate on that damn immunity idol. We discussed putting votes toward Desi, but I have to give  credit where credit is due. They played a hell of a game, and they got me.
