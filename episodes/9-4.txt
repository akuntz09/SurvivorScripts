<br/> <br/>Probst: Previously on Survivor: At Yasur, Eliza had some  explaining to do.  <br/>How the hell did the vote switch to Dolly?  <br/>I thought she was writing my name down.  <br/>How about clueing us in, Eliza?  <br/>I'm not so sure Eliza is in with us. Even then I don't  know if I trust her, but I've got a backup plan.  <br/>Probst: At Lopevi, Rory was fed up with Sarge's military  ways.  <br/>Do you feel I'm not pulling my weight?  <br/>I saw you going on a lot of walks.  <br/>Sarge wants to dictate when people take a crap, when you  sit down, when you work, and I don't take orders real well.  <br/>Probst: At Yasur, Twila and Mia had it out over the division  of labor.  <br/>You take the martyr and you play on that role!  <br/>You stay here five minutes and then your ass goes down...  I'll whup the little scrawny bitch's ass. I ain't here to make no  friends.  <br/>Probst: At the challenge, the tribes got a big surprise.  Today you are playing for both reward and immunity. Here's the twist. Both  tribes will vote out one member tonight.  <br/>No!  <br/>Probst: Separate Tribal Councils, two people going home.  In the first of two rounds Lopevi won the reward. Lopevi, congratulations.  You now have a Hawaiian sling, fishing gear and a mask. The men also won the  opportunity to play for individual immunity while the women sat out. It was  John K. who won the necklace and a little something extra. John, you're now  going to leave and go back to camp with Yasur. You'll be gathering  information for a very big decision, because tonight when your Tribal is  over, you will stay behind. You will give your immunity to one member from  Yasur.  <br/>Probst: At Yasur, John witnessed a tribe divided.  <br/>You just keep saying you don't want there to be a  tie.  <br/>I don't trust you, Eliza.  <br/>Don't trust me.  <br/>I could care a less who gets voted off of this tribe. I  just want them to not be mad at me for whoever gets voted off.  <br/>Probst: At Lopevi's Tribal Council John K. reunited with  his tribe, and even though Rory got three votes the alliance of elders held  and J.P. was voted out. J.P., the tribe has spoken. John K. stayed behind for  Yasur's Tribal Council. You know who you're giving it to?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Give it up. And in an attempt to not ruffle any feathers  John gave immunity to Ami who was not in danger of being voted out. When it  came time to vote it was Lisa who betrayed the young girl's alliance by  helping to vote out Mia. Mia, the tribe has spoken. 14 are left. Who will be  voted out tonight? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK  TELEVISION  <br/>You talk about telling the truth.  <br/>I told you that.  <br/>That was before I thought that there was somebody who was  going to flip. I'm sorry I ever apologized almost.  <br/>I'm sorry you took it that way and that's how it is. It is  what it is.  <br/>The vote at Tribal Council shocked the hell out of me.  Lisa was supposedly in an alliance with me, Julie and Mia, so when she voted  against Mia, that totally blindsided me and I was like, "That  bitch."  <br/>You know what, honest the truth, I didn't trust you, so  there you go. Really, it all comes down to you, Eliza. It all comes down to  you.  <br/>The night before, I had voted for Dolly behind Lisa's back  and then I apologized, apologized, apologized. Finally, she forgave me and  then she did the exact same thing. That makes you seem like kind of a  hypocrite.  <br/>You know what, I had a right and I changed my mind. I'm  not going to be confrontational. I did what I did and I'm not going to argue  with you. I told you I didn't trust you and I meant it. I've been giving the  truth all along.  <br/>Except today.  <br/>You have the nerve. You have your nerve.  <br/>You know what, guys? My environment is a little polluted  here. I'm going to go to bed. I love all of you and I'll talk to you  tomorrow.  <br/>I just want us all to become a strong team. If we want to  beat these guys, we need to be tough and we need strong inner and outer. I  don't know how to get there, but we need to get there and I'm going to sleep  because I'm tired.  <br/>I wasn't surprised about Eliza or Julie getting mad at me,  but I voted for who I felt like I needed to vote for last night, so let them  get mad. I would much rather be in an alliance with the older group.  <br/>Guys, I'm going to have to switch with somebody.  <br/>I'm furious. I do not trust Lisa, not one bit. I'm going  to be civil to her and and pretend to be unified because that's what  everybody wants, but if she were gone tomorrow I would be thrilled. She  repulses me now.  <br/>That was hairy for me last night, getting three  votes.  <br/>It's a gut check.  <br/>Getting those three votes. I took three votes last night  in Tribal Council, and yet that doesn't really bother me a whole lot.  <br/>Our five strong is invincible. We need to stay the course  and we have no worries. It's all about the numbers, baby.  <br/>The fact of the matter is, I've got an agreement with  Chad, Travis, Sarge and Chris. That's already a numbers game that works for  me.  <br/>I can't stand the way that this tribe ended up. The good  young guys that have great personalities and are good athletes are all gone.  Why are we letting fat dudes run the show? This doesn't make any sense to me.  I don't know what these guys are doing.  <br/>Yeah. Setting us up for losing challenges and such.  <br/>I don't blame Rory for doing it, but Bubba and Chad.  <br/>Just because it's easy and a sure thing. It's an easy  numbers game right now. They don't have to think very far down the road. I  don't know why they think their plan will work. None of them are very  athletic, and the bottom line is a lot of these challenges are physical so  we'll see what happens.  <br/>The fab five, as long as they got their five, which they  have had since day one there's not much left up in the air. The only thing I  can physically do myself I think is the fishing. If I can endear myself  enough with the fishing, that may change one or two people's minds. Wish me  luck.  <br/>Good luck.  <br/>Good luck. Got one already.  <br/>Yeah. I got him. Give it a chance to grow up.  <br/>I got little fish and its brother littler. The seem like  the only fish dumb enough to get hit by the spear are the small ones.  <br/>Good job, brother! I wouldn't shoot something that small  because that wouldn't even fill one person.  <br/>You know what if they are offering themselves up to me, we  can at least throw them in there. John and I, it's getting down to the  nitty-gritty. Hopefully we'll figure out a way to shake up the game and  change the dynamics of what's going on right now because something's got to  happen.  <br/>Tree mail.  <br/>Oh, my God, look. Oh... oh, my God. "So you think  you're living like the natives, but are they as hungry or as  cold?"  <br/>"Frustrated by your lack of food, your shivering must get  old."  <br/>"Well, put your minds together and maybe you'll  discover...."  <br/>"Help is on the way, and you'll find it under  cover."  <br/>Pig.  <br/>Pig roast.  <br/>Shell... piggie.  <br/>It's a memory thing.  <br/>I am so friggin' good at this.  <br/>Really?  <br/>I think we have a lot better memory than the men do.  <br/>Oh, my God, it's beautiful.  <br/>There's a rainbow.  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>Yay, that means we're going to win.  <br/>Probst: So catch me up. Yasur, how is life at camp?  <br/>Peaceful, good relations, nice rest.  <br/>Probst: Scout, how could life be better?  <br/>If we knew a little bit more about finding food and making  something different, that would be great.  <br/>Probst: Lopevi, what's going on with your camp?  <br/>Once we finally got that spear, just spent a lot of time  out in the water and taking a lot of shots you eventually hit some fish. Most  of them are, you know, a bite or two, but I'm getting better at it. We're  going to have more fish.  <br/>Probst: Okay. Shall we get to today's challenge?  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>Let's do it.  <br/>Probst: It's for reward and it's a very simple memory  test. There are 15 pairs of items covered in the field. Your goal, pair up  matching items, one tribe member at a time. First tribe to pair up five  matching items wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>All right.  <br/>Probst: Da, mith.  <br/>All right. We're going to learn something.  <br/>Probst: This is Da. Da's from the Amberian tribe. He's  going to spend the next hours with the winners of this challenge. Put it  simply, Da is a rock star when it comes to living on the island. He doesn't  speak a lot of English. You're going to have to draw information out of him,  but he knows how to find food, how to catch food and how to cook food. He  knows how to better your shelter, how to improve overall your living  situation. You've only been out here nine days, you still have 30 days left  if you make it all the way. This could completely change the way you live  from here on out. Worth playing for?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Sure.  <br/>Probst: All right. Take your spots. Wait for my go. Okay,  Lopevi won the right to go first. Chad, you're up. Wooden pig. Tamtam.  <br/>Tamtam.  <br/>Probst: Lisa. Shrimp trap.  <br/>Probst: It's a guess at this point. Coconut. Four items  revealed. No matches. Rory. Starting to get to know the lay of the land.  Tribal drum. Still no matching items. Wooden idol, not to be confused with  the tamtam.  <br/>Scout, you're up.  <br/>Probst: It's a gourd. And a nautilus shell. Not a match.  Somebody is going to match up soon. Bubba, feeling lucky? Grapefruit. Bubba  is thinking about one thing.  <br/>Eating it. [laughs]  <br/>Probst: Looking for another grapefruit.  <br/>Oh, there you go.  <br/>Probst: Tribal drum. The first item that could be matched  up. Ami, ready to go match up the drums. Ami has the first tribal drum. Ami  has a match. First match for Yasur. One pair for Yasur. Lopevi you're up.  Brady reveals a palm frond. Not too excited by the palm frond.  <br/>All right. Got it.  <br/>Probst: The other grapefruit. Second item could be matched  up. Eliza pulls off the first grapefruit and the second grapefruit. Yasur  with another match. They are up 2-0.  <br/>Nice grapefruits.  <br/>Probst: Yasur with two matching pairs, Lopevi with none.  Chris, pig jaw. Is he going to go back to something familiar or something  new?  <br/>Shrimp trap. Lopevi reveals another potential match.  Julie, looking for matching shrimp traps. Julie has the first shrimp trap.  She has to remember where the last one was. Chris just revealed it. And she  has it. Yasur with their third pair of matching items. John, Lopevi trailing  3-0. Oh, yeah. He stumbled on to something, the pig jaw. The other pig jaw  has been revealed. Can John remember where it sits? Nope, the wooden pig.  That's the second wooden pig. Leann. She has the first pig jaw. Another match  for Yasur. They lead 4-zip. They are one pair away. Sarge, getting his first  shot at the course, wasting no time, goes back to the wooden pig and Lopevi  has their first match. They are finally on the board. That's 4-1. Yasur needs  just one more match to win it.  <br/>Oh, yes!  <br/>Probst: Coconut. Where's the other coconut? We've seen it.  Nope. Not a match. After four in a row Yasur misses. Guys, still alive.  There's the first coconut and he did it. Lopevi back in it. 4-2. Lisa, Yasur  with their second chance to win the game, just need to match up one more  pair, and they win the services of Da. There's the nautilus shell. Lisa  stumbled upon the nautilus shell. Can she remember where the other one is?  She's seem very confident with her skip. There it is. Yasur wins  reward.  <br/>You are just the girl to bring it home. Good job.  <br/>Probst: Lopevi. I got nothing for you. No reward. Heading  back to camp.  <br/>Good job, Yasur.  <br/>Thanks.  <br/>Good job, ladies.  <br/>Probst: Yasur, you want to meet Da?  <br/>Yes!  <br/>Probst: Da, come on in.  <br/>Hey.  <br/>Hello, Da.  <br/>Probst: You guys have won the chance to benefit from the  knowledge of a native tribesman for 24 hours.  <br/>All right.  <br/>Probst: You guys head back to camp. He has his own way of  getting there. He has his own way of getting there. He'll meet you  there.  <br/>You guys, I see him coming. Should we be on the beach to  welcome him? I'm so excited.  <br/>At the challenge today we won an island expert for 24  hours. His name is Da, and he's supposed to know everything about these  islands, how to hunt, fish, cook, shelter, anything we need to know, he's  supposed to know it so we want to learn from him, busy when he's gone, that's  it.  <br/>Hello.  <br/>Hola.  <br/>Da, came up on the beach, we all came to greet him. We  were going to stop and introduce ourselves. No time for that. He came in here  with a purpose.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>Hurry.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Good.  <br/>That would take us about a half an hour.  <br/>[speaking native language] half an hour.  <br/>[speaking native language]  <br/>Watch how he does that. Holy Toledo.  <br/>It was right there.  <br/>Da, he like pulled up a root and he's like, have you been  eating this? We're like no, and he chops it, and he's like, here you  go.  <br/>Keep an eye on him and he just keeps walking and we were  just chasing to keep up to him.  <br/>Cut it off? Cook 'em and eat 'em.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Who knew we had all this food in our backyard and we  thought it was all gone. We just didn't know what to eat.  <br/>There's something else.  <br/>It looks like bamboo.  <br/>In between the long cornstalks.  <br/>Sugar cane. Sugar.  <br/>We've got sugar cane, which is just unbelievable. That's  everybody's favorite.  <br/>That's the best thing ever.  <br/>What is that?  <br/>Eat.  <br/>Nut.  <br/>Da seemed to understand us more than we could understand  him. He had to kind of use his hands a lot. Eventually we got it.  <br/>Face is right there.  <br/>Eyes, nose.  <br/>Look at that. All right.  <br/>Da, he's just amazing. We're all in awe, I mean just  watching... taking in the knowledge that he's giving us and he's cooking us a  great dinner. It's a godsend, it's a blessing, it really is.  <br/>Da was like a big breath of fresh air. He really took our  focus off each other and focused more on what's going on around us. I  definitely feel more confident that I can find food by myself, I could cook  it by myself and I think he really boosted team morale that we all have that  confidence and that's huge.  <br/>Bubba getting tired of plantains.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I bet old Da could have told a few more things to  eat.  <br/>I bet they will have a hell of a meal tonight.  <br/>Today's reward challenge would have really been fabulous  because every creature comfort we could have come up with could have been at  our fingertips right there.  <br/>I'm fixing to go through withdrawal.  <br/>What?  <br/>Food.  <br/>Camp morale at this point is low. Bubba for one is not  liking this day-to-day plantain thing, he's just not into it and it's really  affecting his mood.  <br/>I'm going to start carving my wife's and children's name  on my pole. I'm from the country. Every meal was a celebration. You know, you  eat with your family. My biggest concern is how my family is doing. You know,  are they missing Dad? You know they are, but my boys are my life. They are  everything.  <br/>I'm worried about Trav.  <br/>The thing is, he'll just let his thoughts get the best of  him, you know?  <br/>It's becoming obvious that Bubba's weakness is definitely  his family. I'm just telling you personally it's going to really affect you  physically if you don't put that ... behind you. It's a weakness, man. People  start to question whether or not you're tripping. That's going to affect  people's perceptions of you.  <br/>Like I'm trying to be a loner. All right, hey, appreciate  it.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>The thing with Rory is, a lot of times I think he's really  misunderstood.  <br/>Whoa, man, we don't want dirt all over it.  <br/>There was already dirt all over it.  <br/>Everybody's got strong personalities here and Rory is no  exception.  <br/>Man, don't use clean water cleaning our food.  <br/>Sarge, you are so difficult to keep happy, man.  <br/>With Sarge and Rory, it's just an ongoing barrage of  bickering.  <br/>All the canteens have to be done in a line, too.  <br/>Yeah, I know, I know, I know.  <br/>Whether it's this filling the canteens full of water, how  much wood to put on the fire, how to cook something, it's a lot of bickering  and I'm tired of it.  <br/>You could have handed it to me.  <br/>There's always rocks on it.  <br/>Okay, okay, okay.  <br/>Damn.  <br/>I'm just saying, you don't have to throw at me like a  bone.  <br/>All right, play nicely or you're both going to time out.  Right now we just need harmony on the team and today that definitely wasn't  happening.  <br/>Right now Da is making our beds comfortable.  <br/>The man took bamboo and kept chopping and chopping and  chopping and then split it open and flattened it out and all those  humpity-bumpity bumps we had in the bed-- they're gone.  <br/>It's like a mattress. This is going to be so good. Thank  you. Okay. Fishing.  <br/>Fishing?  <br/>Fishing.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>That night, Da made torches out of dry palmetto, lit them  up and we took off down the beach crab hunting. He was good to do anything  that we asked and I thought it was just extremely gracious of him.  <br/>[speaking native language]  <br/>Not a good night to try? There were no crabs. He said the  tide needed to be further out, but to find ways that we can learn from each  other and speak to each other and cross cultures, it was touching to have an  example of that happening in this exotic place.  <br/>It was a good day. I think a lot of feelings were healed,  and I think our tribe kind of came back together. It was just a very  wonderful day for everybody.  <br/>What did he get?  <br/>It looks like a crab.  <br/>Oh, wow, a crab.  <br/>Thanks, Da. This is wonderful. Having Da here was  absolutely incredible, and I was surprised how emotionally attached we all  got to Da just within 24 hours. We were all like, you know, practically  crying when he left.  <br/>Thanks, Da.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Thanks, Da.  <br/>Bye.  <br/>Bye, Da.  <br/>That was a great  <br/>This was the best reward we could have won. It was a  morale booster, and, oh, my God, it couldn't have come at a better time,  because next time we have to go to challenge we'll be ready in a big  way.  <br/>I have absolutely no idea how to use a Hawaiian sling. I  know the concept, but I don't have any aim, any direction, but it's the first  day. We'll see how it goes.  <br/>You going fishing?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Just be really careful you don't break a point. Rory took  the spear and just milled around for hours today. I've been trying to figure  out a way for the last few days here for a little bit of a rift between Sarge  and Rory. I think it's doable because I think the Sarge gets put off by him a  little bit, too. Look at that. He takes off with the spear so he can walk  around and have fun poking through the reef.  <br/>Looking for sea shells for his little kids?  <br/>That's not helping get us dinner at all. He's never going  to put any fish in this fire. It's never going to happen. I was maybe a  little bit sharper with the tongue today. I was trying to just shake things  up just a little bit and figure out if there's any room to go one way or the  other. Who do you think is going to consider Rory a threat?  <br/>Nobody.  <br/>Exactly. So who is going to vote against Rory? Nobody.  He's not going to have anybody vote against him so who do you think is going  to be there in the end? I planted my seed. I did what I thought I could do. I  think our efforts should be on doing better as a tribe and winning. Maybe if  we start strengthening our tribe instead of making it weaker, things will  improve.  <br/>Tree mail.  <br/>Cool.  <br/>"Many hands make light work, so the saying goes. Fail to  put your minds together and add to your tribe's woes. In a test of mental  agility, it's anybody's game. Tribal Council for the losers, one more will  lose their flame."  <br/>Put your minds together.  <br/>We need to win this immunity because Julie and I are the  only two people left who voted the opposite way of the majority at the last  Tribal Council so we both feel very vulnerable and feel like this win is  essential.  <br/>Probst: Come on in! All right, Let's get to today's  challenge. We're at an interesting point in the game. We're still even, seven  members each in a game that is all about numbers. This is what guarantees you  the numbers. Let me explain the challenge. Both tribes are going to solve a  tile puzzle. There are four Vanuatu symbols, each symbol in four different  colors for a total of 16 tiles. Arrange the tiles so that none of the same  symbols, none of the same colors are in the same row or same column. You'll select  up person to be your eyes. They will have a vantage point above on a tower.  First tribe to complete the puzzle correctly wins immunity. Losers going to  Tribal Council tonight. Yasur, who is going to be your set of eyes? Eliza.  Lopevi, who is going to be your set of eyes?  <br/>Rory.  <br/>Probst: Rory. All right, take your spots. Wait for my go.  Here we go, guys, for immunity. Survivors ready. Go.  <br/>Start flipping, start flipping.  <br/>Probst: First thing you've got to do is find out what  you're dealing with. Four different symbols, each symbol comes in four  different colors. Cannot have the same symbol or the same color in any row or  any column.  <br/>Don't start moving them around quite yet.  <br/>Don't move them around quite yet. Just flip 'em  over.  <br/>Leave that one there, Sarge. Chad, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,  get the brown pig and take it up to the brown skull. Let's get the colors  straightened up first.  <br/>Leave it there, Sarge.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Twila, start switching this and those. These two in the  second column. Switch those two. No, no, no. Julie, switch the one in front  of you and the one you're on.  <br/>Probst: There is a key to figuring this out.  <br/>Chad, bring the pig down here where the brown palm tree  is.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>The red, the brown, okay. Are there any colors that are in  the same column or the same row.  <br/>No, no, let's work on symbols.  <br/>Now all we need to do is work on the symbols.  <br/>All right.  <br/>We got it.  <br/>So I need a blue volcano.  <br/>Move that down to the pig.  <br/>Switch like colors, right?  <br/>Work with your light colors.  <br/>Okay, than that right here.  <br/>That with the brown.  <br/>No, no, no, no. Chris, don't...  <br/>Probst: You guys need to work together. You're never going  to solve this.  <br/>Listen, listen. Okay, Leann, come here. We need a diagonal  of the same color all the way across and a diagonal of every opposite shape  all the way across. The pigs were all in a diagonal.  <br/>Diagonal is this way.  <br/>We need a same color.  <br/>You guys got to start working here, guys.  <br/>Don't stand on the symbols.  <br/>Look, knucklehead, geez.  <br/>Look, guys, guys.  <br/>Listen to Rory.  <br/>Guys, guys, guys!  <br/>Probst: Rory may have lost control of this.  <br/>What if we did this one diagonal, too?  <br/>Scout, exactly what Scout just said. Perfect.  <br/>Probst: Yasur working together well.  <br/>Check it out. We need a blue palm tree, blue palm tree  right here.  <br/>I need a volcano. Orange volcano. You're trying to do is  one at a time.  <br/>Go with a red pig.  <br/>Orange volcano right here.  <br/>You've got two skulls,.  <br/>I know, man. We're not done yet.  <br/>Probst: Lopevi, total chaos.  <br/>No, no, do what she is saying, switch 'em back. Let's do  what she's saying. She's got the eyes.  <br/>Okay, girls, now where's the yellow skull? Okay. Yellow  skull, brown skull, switch it, switch it, switch it.  <br/>Put it there. We got it.  <br/>Probst: Eliza thinks she's on to something.  <br/>I think we got it.  <br/>Make sure. Check every one.  <br/>Two volcanoes in the same row.  <br/>Okay, okay, okay.  <br/>And two skulls in the same row? Can we switch them? We  ought to switch these two.  <br/>Take the black skull and put it where the black volcano  is.  <br/>Hey, guys, hear me out.  <br/>I think we got it, Jeff.  <br/>Probst: Lopevi, hold up. Yasur wins immunity. Their second  challenge in a row. Yasur, congratulations. No Tribal Council tonight.  Guaranteed at least one more day out here. Lopevi, never good to go to Tribal  Council. Somebody is going home tonight. You have the afternoon to figure out  who that is going to be. Go back to camp and see you at Tribal.  <br/>The challenge today for immunity was pretty much  pandemonium. It was a mess. We didn't even come close.  <br/>There was just people screaming orders, and it was just a  cluster.  <br/>And we all had our plan, but we said Rory would do the  talking and that's what messed us up. I mean right off the bat, I seen a way  to do it, but I didn't want to interfere with Rory.  <br/>Most of us were sitting around most of the time, not  saying anything, waiting for direction.  <br/>It was the worst performance as a team unit that we've had  and I pretty much take that on my shoulders.  <br/>It didn't really matter who was on the podium. We had  people screaming orders and nobody was listening to nobody.  <br/>There's a lot of yelling going on. If you looked up, Rory  just sitting looking with a blank stare like he couldn't figure it out.  <br/>So is the reason Rory still in because he's not seen as a  threat.  <br/>No. He's supposed to be real good at puzzles.  <br/>He didn't do better than anyone else today.  <br/>I know. Maybe he just had a bad day. What if they vote for  Brady tonight. Would you vote that way? Maybe it will show people that you're  willing to work with us. You see what I'm saying?  <br/>The way I look at it, bro, what does your group have to  offer that's going to beat those girls? Me and Brady are more athletic than  anyone here. You really think you guys are going to win some immunity  challenges?  <br/>Let me ask you something. This little alliance we have  going on, who do you think is the leader?  <br/>You. Sarge?  <br/>He's called every shot.  <br/>Man, I hope the five of us really are together because if  not I'm dead right now. If anybody turned around in our alliance and went  against me it would be Sarge, and it really scares the hell out of me. Sarge  just likes to dictate what goes on. I don't know if you've noticed that or  not.  <br/>Yeah, I've noticed. It's hard to miss. Within our alliance  we do have some conflict. Sarge could at the last second make a change. Sarge  does like to be in control.  <br/>Pull yourself up. If Brady gets voted out, okay, I'm going  to lose a real good work partner. There you go, get up there, get up there.  There you go. I would keep him here to the end because he's one of the  strongest. Don't let that son of a bitch win. My background tells me have the  strongest warriors with you when you go to a battle. There you go, all right,  all right. The pack wants Brady gone but Rory is a bad seed and you don't  need bad seeds on a team when you're fighting for survival. Hey, we'll see  what happens.  <br/>Probst: Welcome to Tribal Hey, we'll see what  happens.  <br/>Probst: Welcome to Tribal Council. Before we get to the  vote let's talk about today's challenge. Rory, you got zero respect today.  How does it make you feel? Every Tribal we've come to, you've gotten votes.  Then today you're leading the tribe, which is odd to me, and then even  weirder, nobody listens.  <br/>I am the leading vote- getter at this point, Jeff, and I'm  scared as hell right now, as a matter of fact.  <br/>Probst: The last two days have seen a huge shift in  momentum, with the women clearly in control. They win the reward challenge  improve their camp life dramatically. They win the immunity challenge today  and force you guys to vote out yet another member. Bubba, can you guys sense  that shift happening?  <br/>Yeah, Jeff, they really kicked us in the groin today. We  really took it hard, but the thing of it is I really think that we're going  to be a whole new ball team come next game, I really do, Jeff, I really  believe that.  <br/>Probst: Based on what I'm looking at, I don't buy it at  all. Brady, do you think it's possible that you guys started playing an  individual game way too soon?  <br/>I think at the very, very beginning, day one, maybe even  hour one, individuals started thinking about where they were going to be six,  eight challenges down the road, and I think that mindset took apart a lot of  our team concept right from the very beginning.  <br/>Probst: Chris, the obvious problem with playing an  individual game you is may last longer than the guy next to you, but you're  not going to last longer than the women.  <br/>Yeah, but you don't necessarily know where the women are  coming from. You don't necessarily know if the women are going to be playing  numbers or how are the women playing? We don't know how they are  playing.  <br/>Probst: What on Earth would make you think they're going  to do anything but stick together?  <br/>There's nothing that makes me think they wouldn't stick  together. But I'm just saying, look, you're a team at first, you're a tribe,  you have to no choice, but the bottom line is looking ahead individually,  you've got to make sure you do what's right for you. I mean, anything can  happen.  <br/>Probst: Chad, as Chris was saying that, you were shaking  your head in agreement.  <br/>If things within the tribe starts happening where there's  a sense that people are starting to go individual, what are you going to do as  an individual if you feel that that is starting to happen, you have to jump  on. Ideally the tribe will come first, but this individual thing has to be  your backup plan. It's the only way to save your own butt.  <br/>Probst: John, are you concerned tonight you might be going  home?  <br/>I'm extremely worried. The past two guys that were voted  out were two of the more athletic guys in our group so, yeah, I'm scared. I  mean, There's not much more I can do. I'm not going to back down and pretend  I'm not a good athlete.  <br/>Probst: Brady, why are you voting the way you're voting  tonight?  <br/>I'm voting first and foremost to make sure our team  doesn't lag behind the other team. I want this team to stop that momentum  slide, turn it around and go into the merge with some momentum, that's the  way I'm voting.  <br/>Probst: With that, it's time to vote. Chris, you're  up.  <br/>Brady, you caught the Chris, you're up.  <br/>Brady, you caught the first fish, you even climbed the  pole, but the spirits sometimes dictate that it's time for you to go.  <br/>Maybe the third time's the charm.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read  the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal  Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Brady. Brady.  Two votes Brady. Rory. Two votes Brady, one vote Rory. Three votes Brady. The  fifth person voted out of Survivor Vanuatu, Brady. That's four votes, that's  enough. Please bring me your torch. Brady, the tribe has spoken. It's time  for you to go.  <br/>Good luck, fellas.  <br/>Probst: Well, based on your first three Tribal Councils,  it would appear that you're voting out tribe members that you think might  become an individual threat later in the game. Only potential problem with  that strategy-- it's still early in the game. See how it plays out. Grab your  torches and go back to camp. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.  Next time on Survivor:  <br/>There are people coming in on a canoe.  <br/>Are you serious?  <br/>I'm dead serious.  <br/>Probst: Lopevi and Yasur face a shakeup. All right,  everybody, drop your buffs. And then...  <br/>Holy ...  <br/>Oh, my gosh.  <br/>Whoa! You feel that earthquake?

Can't help but feel like a  bit of a loser, but in the back of my mind I'm hoping there was one of those  things where they said Brady is one of those guys that he makes it to the  merge, he's going to kick my ass, so I'll take that little bit of  self-encouragement along with me.
