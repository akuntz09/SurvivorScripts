<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: For the past 18 days, the yellow tribe,  Kota, was the king of the jungle, winning eight out of ten challenges. Kota, once again, immunity is yours. The entire tribe was united, except for Dan and Susie. <br/>I don't have the confidence that we get to the merge and these people have  got my back. <br/>Probst: Throughout the game, the red tribe, Fang, consistently made  questionable moves. <br/>I'm stuck in a tribe that has no skills. <br/>Probst: Ace made a heads-up play...  That's the deal. <br/>Deal? <br/>Deal. <br/>Probst: ...when he pulled Matty into an alliance with his long-time ally,  Sugar. <br/>I've been relying on Ace the whole time. <br/>One of Sugar's biggest plusses is the fact that she has the immunity idol. And I've got Sugar in my pocket. <br/>Probst: Their first move was to vote out Ace's biggest enemy, Kelly. Kelly, the tribe has spoken. 12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? âª âª [animals chirping, chittering] [animals chirping,  chittering] [animal squawks in distance] [animal squawks in distance]  This is a tough game. <br/>This is a tough game. We're starving. We're starving. <br/>There's nothing to eat. I'm starting to lose my spirit, I'm starting to lose my hope. It's-it's become hopeless. It's-it's become hopeless. I'm hopeless about Fang. I'm hopeless about Fang. <br/>What happened? <br/>As soon as I got up, it tipped over. But just a little bit came out. But I'll scoop it back in there, 'cause it... it was just a little bit. <br/>That's a ton. Rice is more valuable than gold, and she just clumsily trips over it and  spills it. I wanted to just lay into her and chew her out, but I... it's just pointless. You can't cry over spilled milk, you know? milk, you know? It's just too late. It's just too late. Is it done? <br/>Yeah. Not so bad. <br/>You guys ready? <br/>Nothing like some fresh  Nothing like some fresh oatmeal rice. oatmeal rice. <br/>I don't want to take away from you and Matty. <br/>Crystal, eat. <br/>Ace, you eat. <br/>Come on, please? <br/>You don't have to beg me. You eat. I don't want to feel like I took away from anybody in this tribe. So by all means, eat your full, like you normally do. <br/>This tribe, Fang tribe, we're not working together. Everybody has grudges against each other. Matty and Ace are basically going against Crystal. These guys are trying to call the shots, and I don't like that, I don't like  that at all. <br/>You guys don't haveto say anything, but your faces say a thousand words. That's the difference between me and you guys. <br/>Crystal did me a favor. She will be the next lamb to the slaughter.

[laughter]  I think Charlie and Marcus and Corinne seem very, very tight, and at times  almost exclusive. And I'm just the type of person that I'm always gonna feel a little bit  vulnerable, a little bit insecure. I mean, I wanted to clarify that I'm, like, a really sensitive person. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And it's weird when I'm not part of a group. I kind of, like... it-it, like, makes me feel bad a little bit. That's just me, like, that's how I am with groups. <br/>Yeah. Yeah. <br/>You know, I like to be part of the group. <br/>I would say that Dan is socially inept in a lot of ways. I don't know if he's a former fatty or why he wasn't liked as a child, but  deep down inside he's a little kid that's seeking approval. <br/>It's different than Fang, where I alienated myself because I didn't like  those people. With you guys, it's completely opposite. It's, like, all right, I really like these three...  Dan is the ultimate paranoid human being. At some point, Dan is gonna be a huge liability, and unfortunately, there's  nothing I can do to-to sort of save him from-from himself at this point. <br/>Do you feel better? <br/>Yeah, I do. <br/>Okay. <br/>Do you guys? <br/>Yeah. <br/>All right. Good. âª âª  Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Kota getting your first look at the new Fang Tribe. Kelly voted out at the last Tribal Council. All right, you guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>OTHERS: Oh, yeah. Yeah. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, gonna play a little game of keep-away. On my "go," three members of each tribe will toss a breakable ball  back and forth, while one member of the other tribe attempts to smash that  ball or force it to the ground. You'll be playing at the same time, in two rings. The tribe whose attacker breaks their opponent's ball first wins a point. We are playing to three. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Hell, yeah. <br/>Probst: The winning tribe will be picked up by helicopter, flown to a  beautiful location here in Gabon. You'll be bringing with you everything you need for a nice afternoon picnic. [gasps]  Beer. <br/>Beers. <br/>Probst: You have some bread, veggies, meats, cheeses...  Cheese! <br/>Probst: ...some nice drinks. It should be a fun afternoon. In addition, the winning tribe will send one member of the losing tribe to  Exile Island. Worth playing for? <br/>OTHERS: Oh, yeah. Yeah. <br/>Probst: Kota, you have two extra members. Who's gonna sit this one out? Charlie and I would like to be the cheerleaders today. <br/>Probst: Corinne, Charlie, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize, we'll get started. First round, Randy, the attacker for Kota, will be going up against Fang. Ace, the attacker for Fang, he'll be going up against Kota. Fang looking to break a five-challenge losing streak. Survivors, ready... Go! Ace goes after Bob in the Kota ring. Randy very aggressive in the Fang ring. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Ball hits the ground. Kota scores first point! [cheering]  Yeah, Kota! <br/>Over. <br/>Probst: Kota leads: one-zip. Next round, Bob, the attacker for Kota, Sugar, the attacker for Fang. <br/>[growls]  This guy is so ugly over here. He's such an ugly person. He's mean. <br/>Probst: This should be fun. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Survivors, ready... Go! Sugar being aggressive, giving everything she has trying to score for Fang. Bob takes Kenny out, doesn't help. Fang's still alive. Bob takes a hard fall. Stay after him, Sugar. Be a hero. <br/>[laughs]: Okay. <br/>Probst: Fang needs to score. Sugar, you need to pick it up. Do not drop that ball. <br/>[grunts]  Probst: Big takedown from Bob! It doesn't work, though-- Ace keeps the ball alive. <br/>Nice, Ace! <br/>Probst: Sugar doing nothing, absolutely nothing. <br/>Come on, Sugar! <br/>Probst: Sugar's gonna have to get aggressive, try to make something happen. Bob almost deflects it! No! Another takedown by Bob on Matty! <br/>[laughing]  Come on, Sugar! <br/>Probst: Ace tries to get it past Bob, but Bob shuts him down! Kota scores again! Kota leads: two-zip. We are playing to three. This could be it. Next round, attacking for Kota is Dan. He could end this challenge. Attacking for Fang is Matty, trying to keep Fang alive for a big reward. Survivors, ready... Go! Matty comes out strong, chasing after that ball quickly. Dan very aggressive on Ace. Ace gets rid of it to Crystal. Crystal to Sugar, back to Ace. Ace back to Sugar. No! Dan causes the ball to break! Kota scores! Kota wins reward! [excited chatter] All right, Kota, big decision. You're sending one member of Fang to Exile Island. <br/>Let's go ahead and send Sugar. <br/>Probst: Sugar, this is unprecedented. I don't think we've ever had anybody be sent to Exile five times,  back-to-back-to-back... to-back-to-back. <br/>Yeah, I'm here to break records, you know. [laughs]  Probst: All right, Sugar, get your stuff. <br/>Sugar is a pinup model. She is completely worthless when it comes to challenges. So when it comes to Sugar in this game... I would really, really, really  desire her to go. <br/>Probst: Kota, it should be a fun afternoon. [indistinct chatter] Fang, I got nothing for you. <br/>We lost the biggest reward yet. It's hard, you know, when you see them walking away. They have everything, and we have nothing. And we see Kota in their beautiful chopper just lavishing in their reward,  you know? It's madness, it's total It's madness, it's total madness. madness. madness. âª âª  Reward was a helicopter ride, and I was lucky enough to have thefront-row  seat. Just seeing that incredible crater, it made my trip to crater, it made my  trip to Africa. Africa. The only thing that was beating faster than the rotors on that helicopter was  the beating of my heart. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>Close as I want to get. <br/>Holy cow. <br/>Stay away from the edge. <br/>You're making me nervous, Marcus. The beautiful scenery, it was awesome. It's something I thought I would never experience, so it just gives you more  incentive, more power, more strength to know that you can get through this,  no matter what. So it was very... it was very surreal for me. It was just amazing. <br/>Let's get our blanket out. <br/>This is great, let's get our blanket out. blanket out. <br/>Sardines! Ha-ha! <br/>Sardines! Ha-ha! <br/>I don't think in my entire 29 years of living I've ever been so embarrassed. I'm humiliated. I felt pathetic. My spirits are dropping so fast. I look over, and, like, Sugar, she's just, she can't do anything. She's just being dominated. It was pointless for us to even keep going. She was just standing there getting walked all over. I hate it. I'm starting to get pissed. As long as there's physical challenges, we're gonna lose. Want to take a boat ride, Ace? Want to take a boat ride, Ace? <br/>Sure, bro. <br/>Sure, bro. <br/>We need to take out Sugar. Okay, this is what we do. We go Kenny, Crystal and I vote for Sugar. You don't have to vote for Sugar, so you're not backstabbing her, okay? Sugar's gone, and it's you and I to the merge a hundred percent. There's no question. <br/>You know we're a hundred percent, you and me. <br/>No, I don't know that. We're aligned. Me and you are aligned, so make me comfortable. We need to take out Sugar or at We need to take out Sugar or at least get the  idol out. least get the idol out. <br/>Yeah, I see the logic, dude. I see that logic. <br/>Okay, we know exactly where it's sitting, and we can use it to our advantage  when we have to. <br/>You know what they're talking about, right, Cri? <br/>Yeah, those two asses out there in the boat trying to get me off. <br/>They are. Will you trust me? <br/>I've been there with you from day one, Kenny. <br/>We have to blindside Ace. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I have to talk to Sugar. Crystal, you trust me a hundred percent, right? <br/>I trust you a hundred percent. <br/>Okay. <br/>I can feel Ace, right now, strategically, wants to get rid of me. The way that he's manipulating Matty, he's a devil. And he has to go. <br/>This is... this is awesome. <br/>Getting this is just incomparable. <br/>And the best part about this is they don't get it. <br/>And they may be completely out of rice, to add insult to out of rice, to add  insult to injury. injury. <br/>Oh, oh...  What is this? <br/>What is this? <br/>Oh, my...  Oh, my...  Oh, my God! <br/>Wait, stop. Everyone, shh! <br/>Holy cow, these are letters from home. <br/>Oh, my God, they're letters! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [gasps] Oh, my God! They're really letters! <br/>[sobbing]  Bob, are you okay, man? <br/>No, I'm not! <br/>Your family loves you, Bob. <br/>I know it. [sobbing] [grunts] I don't know which one to read first. This is from David. <br/>My dad, he never writes anything, and he wrote me a letter. <br/>Isn't that cool? <br/>He never writes anything. He wasn't even excited. He didn't show any excitement when I was leaving. Wow. <br/>"You should receive..." I can't read it. My eyes keep blurring. I'm close to these people here, but these are the people that are the closest  to my heart. Life is good. And I realize how lucky a man I am. I'm here. And I can't... I can't wait to get home to them. Life doesn't get better than Life doesn't get better than this. this. <br/>Back to the Sugar Shack for me. I don't really know what the hell's happening in this game. I'm just... trying to survive. [laughs] Thank God for Ace. What's funny is I'm pretty sure we're using each other, but I feel like my  tribe thinks I'm naive and that I'm sticking with him out of stupidity, but  I'm sticking with him because he's the strongest player at this point. So I just hope that they're not So I just hope that they're not all screwing  me around. all screwing me around. all screwing me around. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Sugar, We'll now bring in Sugar, returning from Exile  Island. returning from Exile Island. <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: First things first, Dan, I will take it back. Dan, I will take it back. Thank you. Thank you. Good news and bad news about today's challenge. Bad news is, both tribes are going to Tribal Council tonight. Both tribes are gonna vote somebody out. The good news, each of you will have an equal shot at winning... individual  immunity. It's a log roll. You're gonna match up against another tribe member. It might be somebody from the other tribe. It might be somebody from your own tribe. Your goal is to stay on the log longer than the other person. First person to hit the water is out. Winners move on. Last person left standing wins immunity and is safe at tonight's Tribal  Council. <br/>I think I may have a target on my back, so it's very, very important for me  personally to go in there and win, and not just win by a little. Win by a lot. <br/>Probst: In addition, there is a twist which will be revealed after the  challenge is over. <br/>Another twist? <br/>Probst: We'll draw numbers, get our matchups, we'll get get our matchups,  we'll get started. started.

Read it out loud so everybody can hear it. <br/>"You will now assign immunity to one member of the other to one member  of the other tribe." tribe." I'm going to give this to Sugar. <br/>Probst: Sugar, come on over. <br/>Probst: Sugar, come on over. [applause] [applause]  My hope is that Sugar is smart enough to keep the immunity idol to herself  and that might actually end up giving us one of our biggest surprises, which  would be losing a big power player from the Fang tribe in Ace, Matty, or  Crystal. <br/>Probst: Sugar safe at tonight's Tribal Council for Fang. Marcus is safe for Kota's. <br/>When I saw Sugar with the immunity necklace around her neck, I'm like,  "Damn! This girl has two idols!" She is now the most powerful She is now the  most powerful person in this game. person in this game. <br/>Who would you have picked from the other tribe to give immunity to? <br/>I don't know. <br/>You don't know? <br/>Maybe Susie. <br/>Susie? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, you think Susie's gonna be gone tonight? <br/>I think that's irritating people. <br/>Oh. Matty and Ace, they're thinking to get rid of Crystal and it all depends on  the pin-up girl, Sugar. So, yeah, I will lie in this game. I will do everything in my power to get her to vote with me because my life  and Crystal's me because my life and Crystal's life rests upon her. life rests upon her. So, basically, this is honest to God truth. This is what's happening around camp. I'm not lying to you. Matty goes, "We're voting out Sugar next immunity challenge." And  then Crystal's like, "Okay." So then when Crystal went away, I  looked at Ace, I'm like, "Are we really voting out Sugar?" And Ace  is like, "Right now Sugar is really good for nothing except for the  hidden immunity idol." They think you're like clueless, you're like a  dumb blonde or whatever. Okay, and Ace thinks he has you wrapped around his finger. <br/>Okay. I don't trust Kenny, he might have been lying to me. But I have been trusting the biggest snake in the game so far and I've known  that. So, I really don't know who to trust at any point in this game. <br/>Ace is like, "Well, I actually got the hidden immunity idol from her  once, I can probably do that and then we can blindside her and then I'll have  the hidden immunity idol." And I was like, "Oh, my freaking God,  this guy is a snake."  You and I will say we're  You and I will say we're voting on Crystal. voting on Crystal. <br/>We blindside Ace. <br/>Blindside Ace today. <br/>And we don't have to worry about the snake ever again. <br/>Never again. <br/>I trust Sugar and I trust that she will go along with the plan to vote out  Ace. She may be the pin-up girl, but She may be the pin-up girl, but she's very  smart. she's very smart. <br/>Kenny has reassured me all is well. I will truly believe Sugar when she writes Ace's name down. Either she's going to write my name or she's going to write name or she's  going to write Ace's name. Ace's name. Ace's name. <br/>Why? <br/>Why? Who's going to do that? They'd only have two votes. Matty's with you. <br/>They'd have three votes. <br/>No, it'd be Kenny and  No, it'd be Kenny and Crystal, wouldn't it? Crystal, wouldn't it? <br/>I gave it back to you last time. I'll give it back to you this time. <br/>Oh, Ace, I gotta think about it, okay? <br/>That's fine. <br/>You make me feel awful. When Ace asked me for the idol, it made me think maybe Kenny was telling me  the truth. <br/>Don't you think after...  Ace definitely knows how to finagle people much more than I've ever seen  anybody do, probably in my life. But he's definitely had my back. <br/>I'll bring the last of it, and then that's it. <br/>All right, go for it. <br/>Crystal's supposed to go next, but plans could change. Ace could be turning on me now. I have no idea. Oh, God, what am I gonna do with Oh, God, what am I gonna do with this thing? this thing? <br/>Probst: Sugar, you've been out here 21 days. Tell me about camp life. What's going on? <br/>Um, we are very low on rice. Crystal accidentally knocked some over, and she didn't eat because she  knocked it over. <br/>Probst: Kenny, how much rice did you have before Crystal knocked it over? <br/>We had about seven days worth. Crystal ended up scooping some of the rice that she spilled outside back into  the pot. So, probably had about five and a half days worth of rice. <br/>Probst: So, Matty, the rice is so valuable, that if you spill even a little  in the dirt, you gotta pick it out grain by grain. <br/>The rice is valuable. It's the most valuable thing we have. We get about six to eight spoonfuls a day of rice. <br/>Probst: Wow. <br/>And she spills the rice, and nobody goes, "God, Crystal, what are you  doing?!" Nobody...  No, but your faces said it all. <br/>Just simmer down. <br/>Your face said it all. <br/>My face says it all... nobody says a word to her. <br/>Because they knew it was an accident. <br/>Exactly, so just...  I didn't purposely go over to the rice box and just throw the rice down. <br/>Just let me get to my point. Can I get to my point? <br/>Get to your point and then I'll talk. <br/>So, then we looked past it. We moved past that issue. <br/>Probst: Ace, make sense of that for me. <br/>Crystal made a mistake. That's common. The whole part of us feeling angry at her I thought was a bit concocted in  her own head. <br/>Now I'm delusional. I can see it on your face, Ace. Okay, don't look at me like that. When Matty turned around he was like, "Oh, whatever." Then he made  some look at you, Ace. I didn't say anything to anybody. I just sat down there picking up about 20,000 grains of rice and then they  started to eat. "Oh, Crystal, come on and eat." No, I spilled some of the rice so I  will go without and that's what I did and that's why I did it. <br/>Nobody asked you to, Crystal. <br/>It's not like you saved me any anyways-- you still ate it. <br/>I asked you three times...  Yeah, I mean, if you cared enough you would've saved me some anyways. <br/>Probst: Sugar, you have, like, the perfect seat in the midst of this great  Shakespearean drama. <br/>I know. <br/>Probst: Your eyes are like saucers. <br/>This sounds like such petty bull crap to me. I mean, I think that we can get past our issues better than this, and this is  why we haven't been winning, because people are holding these stupid, petty  things against each other. <br/>Probst: All right, Sugar, you have individual immunity tonight. You can assign that to somebody else or keep it for yourself. <br/>Keeping it. <br/>Probst: Sugar is safe tonight. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Ace, you're up. Ace, you're up. <br/>You're one of the snakes, and I got to get rid of you. I got to get rid of you. Go home. Go home. <br/>Crystal, I've been waiting for this day for so long, and I for this day for  so long, and I am so happy it's here. am so happy it's here. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes.

Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. Don't go away. Coming up next, Kota prepares for their own Tribal Council. <br/>Right now would be an optimal time to get me out. <br/>Probst: While Dan digs his own grave... Susie commits social suicide. <br/>I was actually going to vote you. <br/>Really?! I hate her. I hate her. I want her gone, yesterday. I want her gone, yesterday. <br/>Can I ask you a question? <br/>What? <br/>I'm not going tonight, am I? <br/>Not that I know of. Given the fact that everyone's voting for Susie. <br/>It has to be Susie, 'cause we have no idea. We could stay together as a tribe for another two rounds. Right now would be an optimal time to get me out as a strong player so this  is a huge vote for me, because I'm either going to come back here and trust  everyone or I'm going to be at everyone or I'm going to be at home eating a  pizza. home eating a pizza. <br/>Please trust us. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And, you know...  And, you know...  And-and that is incredible faith on my part, but I know I got to do it. <br/>Randy's replaced Bob in a final four situation, because I think Randy's  willing to cast his lot in with a good group of people, and he's found that. And he, you know, as long as he keeps his end of the bargain, he's got a  great run for this he's got a great run for this game. game. <br/>She knows she's low man on the totem pole. She's bound to. She may continue to dig her grave all day long, and-and y'all's conclusion  may shift. <br/>Of course. <br/>As annoying as Bob is, I see him as being as loyal and trustworthy as the day  is long. <br/>And-and right now, I can't say the same thing about Dan. <br/>I can't, either. <br/>But I'm closer being able to say it about Susie than I am about Dan. <br/>Dan is super vulnerable tonight. And the only thing Dan has going for him right now is that he should really  cross his fingers that Susie's going to blow up that Susie's going to blow up  and do some crazy stuff. and do some crazy stuff. <br/>I really like you, and I don't want you to go home. So I'm not writing your name down, and I just wanted you to know that. You're just not on my list of...  Do you know who-who they're thinking about voting out? <br/>Um, I think that it's going to be Dan. <br/>That's what your-- your guess is it's gonna be Dan? <br/>I think so, yeah. But we felt like we don't want to take somebody that's gonna flip. I feel really good about the fact that you wouldn't. <br/>No, I wouldn't, as long as you keep me in the loop. I-I figured people were talking, and I figured eventually they would come to  me and tell me where I'm at, you know. 'Cause I-- when I was gonna-- Okay, I'm gonna be honest with you. I was actually going to vote you, because...  Why? <br/>Because I know that I'm a hard worker. I-I know that without having fire and water and food, how are you going to  perform physically? You're going to have to take that time to do that work. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>So I'm just being totally up front with you, so, and that's the truth. <br/>Okay, so you need me to help more. <br/>Well, yeah, I need help from everybody, actually. So that's where I'm at. But I-I appreciate that, 'cause now I know which way I can swing. <br/>So this moron has decided that she'd like me to go. Really?! I hate her. I hate her, hate her, hate her. Like, I really want to stab her in the face. And if you piss me off, you've And if you piss me off, you've pissed off my  alliance. pissed off my alliance. <br/>Did I not say to you guys she's nuts? I mean, certifiable. <br/>But she's the worst kind of nuts, 'cause you don't see it coming. <br/>She goes whichever way the wind is blowing. <br/>Um, I mean, I hate her. I want her gone, yesterday. <br/>Susie's game is no game. And the problem with no game is her vote can be bought. She's gone. <br/>Tonight, I don't want any sort of curveball. I do not want to go home tonight. I don't know what could be cooking. I mean, Dan doesn't have the idol, does he? <br/>Not that I know of. <br/>What if Susie and Dan get together, Dan has the idol, and he's like,  "Let's both vote Corinne"? <br/>Then you're gone. <br/>Let's just take her out. Then she has to go. <br/>Everybody's ass is on the line. Susie needs to go. She's annoying. I want her to go home, and soon. <br/>So, um, here's the thing. My entire plan was wedged on the fact that Susie is easy, she trusts us, and  she's never gonna win individual immunity. We can get rid of her when we want. I didn't realize she was loco en la cabeza. Like, I had no idea that that was what I was dealing with. <br/>I am devastated right now. <br/>Well, I'm completely frustrated, because I feel like we got some issues that  we had no idea existed. <br/>What do you think is the safer bet? 'Cause I'm really a little concerned. <br/>We're at the point where I think either decision has incredible risks  associated with it. <br/>Right. <br/>Thank God we have a two-person advantage at this point. But Dan could have the immunity idol. But I really doubt it, so-- If he actually does have the immunity idol, we  should vote out Susie. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Just in case there's an idol. <br/>Yeah. We're worried that Dan has the immunity idol, because he spent a couple days  on Exile Island. But we also think that Dan may need to go. So unfortunately, it's not who is the best asset. It's who is the least risky. Which stinks because, you know, we still don't know who we're we still don't  know who we're gonna be better off with. gonna be better off with. <br/>Probst: Marcus, is the game at a point where you're now looking out for  yourself versus keeping our tribe strong? <br/>I think we're basing our decision on what we're expecting to come in the next  few days. We've got to surround ourselves with the most powerful crowd of people,  because that's the only way we're going to survive an onslaught from the rest  of the Fang tribe. <br/>Probst: Susie, looking at this tribe, you got to be a little concerned  yourself. Is it fair to say that you're the weakest person on this tribe in challenges? <br/>I-I don't think I am. I think there's certain skills that I may be a little bit weaker at, but...  Probst: Who's weaker than you on this tribe? <br/>Um, I think strength-wise, upper strength, I think I'm stronger than Corinne. <br/>Probst: Corinne not buying that at all. <br/>I don't want to insult her. I think that she is very skilled, and I think that she does have athletic  talent, you know. <br/>Probst: She just insulted you. <br/>Well, yes, and that's why I'm telling you that I don't agree. I think that I have a lot to offer. I think I have upper body strength. I think I've got a lot of things, but...  And you probably do. I don't-- I mean, I'm just, I'm trying to just kind of observe and just kind  of see where this game's taking me, and...  Probst: Corinne, have you picked up on Susie's tendencies to maybe sometimes  let loose? <br/>Yeah, but I've operated without a filter for so many years that, like, I  totally respect when people come out of their shell and just say whatever it  is that they're thinking. I mean, I would encourage more of that. Maybe you should blow up once in a while, and then I'll know you better. <br/>Probst: Randy, where do you sit on the "be yourself" versus  "hold it in"? <br/>I'm probably about eight on a scale of ten, and that's good and bad. <br/>Probst: What's good about it? <br/>I don't have to pretend. And, uh, you know, people pretty much know where I stand most of the time. <br/>Probst: What's bad about it? <br/>I don't have to pretend, and people know where I stand most of the time. [laughter]  Probst: Dan, where do you fit in on that? <br/>Um, I tend to be a worrywart, and so it has inhibited me from being  completely comfortable and completely myself. But my result in the game will fare much better if I can shake it off and  just relax. <br/>Probst: Charlie, how big a factor is trust becoming? 21 days in for this group of seven. <br/>It's huge, because we intend to go into a merge as a powerful group together. And if someone splinters, our numbers will dwindle before the Fang numbers  dwindle. So my vote is based on who I can trust going into a merge most. <br/>Probst: Corinne, is it possible that tonight's vote could be a mistake? <br/>Damn, yeah. I don't know if we're making the right decision or if I personally am making  the right decision. I hope that I am. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. Marcus, thanks to a nice performance today, you have individual immunity. It is yours unless you choose to give it to somebody else. <br/>We won it for Kota, but I'm going to hang on to this one. <br/>Probst: All right, you cannot vote for Marcus. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Bob, you're up. Bob, you're up. <br/>Dan. <br/>Dan. Sorry, guy.

There's a new leader in Africa. And they call him Randy. <br/>I am king of Gabon. I'm sorry, but I rule. This ocean, it's mine. All those Fang and Kota members, they know the power is shifting. I'm king. Cheers. Cheers. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Whoo! <br/>This pretty much blows. There's a definite level of disappointment in relation to Sugar. Matty, I respect you, you know. I wish you the best. C'est la vie. <br/>Um, a lot of mixed feelings right now. A little bit disappointed that I didn't make it further in the game. On the other hand, it feels good to be able to be myself. And I got some great friends and family to go back to, so that's family to go  back to, so that's really about it.
