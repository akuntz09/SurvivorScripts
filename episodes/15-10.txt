<br/>Jeff Probst: Tonight, on a special episode of Survivor: China,we'll take a  closer look at how the final seven survivors made it deep into the game. Todd. <br/>I'm smaller than the rest of our people, but I'm quick and I'm smart. <br/>Probst: Courtney. <br/>My strength is that I'm not a strong player. <br/>Probst: Peih-Gee. <br/>I'm going to come off as a bitch and I'm going to come off as bossy. <br/>Probst: Erik. <br/>Unless I'm way off, I haven't made any enemies. <br/>Probst: Denise. <br/>I want to stay in this game as long as I possibly can. <br/>Probst: Amanda. <br/>I try hard. I'm athletic. I am a huge threat in this game. <br/>Probst: And James. <br/>I really would love to see how these people would be without me being here. It would be hilarious. Because they honestly would be dead. <br/>Watch your mouth, dude. Word gets around. <br/>Todd, when you come confronting me, make sure you know what you're talking  about. <br/>Probst: We'll also see how their stories unfolded...  Bottoms up, baby. <br/>Probst: ...with 14 scenes of all new footage. <br/>I ate the legs and a little bit of the ass and now I'm craving frog. <br/>If we lose, you're going home. <br/>My impression of Jaime. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>If you're not in the mood to accept my apology, that's fine. <br/>No. I know what kind of person you are. <br/>James...  Probst: New twists constantly reshaped the game... Fei Long, you now get to  kidnap one member of their tribe. ...into one of the most ...into one of the most unpredictable Survivorsever. unpredictable Survivorsever. And for the first time ever, one castaway holds two immunity idols...  I cannot stop smiling, because I'm not going anywhere. It's all good, baby. <br/>Probst: ...making him  Probst: ...making him virtually invincible. virtually invincible. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION TELEVISION [ theme  song playing] [ theme song playing]  Probst: 27 days ago, 16 Americans traveled to a remote section of rural China  for the section of rural China for the adventure of a lifetime. adventure of a lifetime. Their journey got off to a grueling start. <br/>We don't know how many more stairs there are. <br/>Have mercy. <br/>Goodness. <br/>I don't see the end. <br/>Guys, it's a long way to go. <br/>We got to the temple, I mean, it was hard. We are carrying bags up 450 stairs and we figured, "Oh, this is it. We're ready to start this thing up."  We should build shelter right here. <br/>More stairs? We're just climbing up these really steep stairs. And every time they curved around, and every time we thought we were there,  it's another curve, and another curve. <br/>I'm telling you guys, ain't no money at the top of this hill. You might as well slow down. We'll go another ten. <br/>All the young kids, they're all, like, grabbing their stuff, running up the  hills. The big guys have got them over their heads and they're walking up. I got stuck with Chicken. He's like, "Take it slow. You don't have been to rush. Ten at a time. We're going to do ten this time." And he'd stop and sit down and wipe  his brow. I'm like, "All right, I'm going to hang with this dude for a to hang  with this dude for a while." while."  Thank you. <br/>Welcome to China. <br/>Welcome to China. [ applause] [ applause]  I was, like, looking at my outfit. I was uncomfortable and I was embarrassed. It's definitely not appropriate for a temple. <br/>Come on, girls. Cover up the boobies for temple. <br/>The Buddhist monks actually came over and gave us drapes. Almost all the girls had to use drapes over their dresses. I'm sure they don't get a whole lot of skimpy dresses in the temple. <br/>Probst: During the Buddhist welcoming ceremony Leslie had a moral dilemma. <br/>I'm a believer in Jesus Christ, and in the bible it says, "Thou shall  not bow down to any other god." You know, it really felt like worship,  and I just couldn't do it. <br/>Probst: When the ceremony ended, the survivors were split into two tribes. Yellow tribe, your name is Zhan Hu, which means "Fighting Tiger."  Red tribe, your name is Fei Long-- it means "Flying Dragon." All  right, good luck, guys. All right, good luck, guys. <br/>Thanks so much. <br/>Thanks so much. <br/>Probst: After settling into camp, Todd nominated Aaron to be the leader of  Fei Long. <br/>We do need someone who's strong and knows how to take lead, and you're very  good at it. <br/>It feels weird, but I can... I think I can did it. <br/>I am very, very smart in trying to push the leader role more so on to Aaron. <br/>Probst: While over at Zhan Hu, Chicken's assertiveness was squashed. <br/>You think this here is going to hold up? <br/>We have to build something, though, so let's stop being negative. <br/>I was just giving my opinion and nobody wanted it, so I'm done suggesting. <br/>Probst: After three days of intense hunger, Zhan Hu resorted to eating  anything they could to eating anything they could get their hands on. get their hands on. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Just don't stare at it. <br/>Just squeeze. <br/>It's like popping a big, nasty zit. <br/>Eww! That's disgusting, Erik. <br/>Dude, I'm hungry. We weren't find any plants we could eat that were edible, and we couldn't get  the fire, so no rice, so there was nothing. I was just ready to eat I was just ready to eat something. something. <br/>You know, that's TMI, man, milking worms. <br/>Milking worm poo. <br/>I'm, like, sitting here, we squeezing poop out of worms, and making people  eat them, but I think they'll be glad they pushed the boundaries, and I think  that's the key to surviving out here. <br/>Shoot it! <br/>I'm hard core. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Ching. <br/>I'm doing three big guys here. here. <br/>Oh, just... ah! <br/>Oh, just... ah! <br/>Do it. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Ew! <br/>Oh! <br/>We're still living so primitively. Nothing to eat. We're drinking dirty rain. Bugs. You know, they're eating worms. I mean, it's just gross. It's just filthy. It's just filthy. It's disgusting. It's disgusting. <br/>Oh, yeah, that wasn't bad at all. <br/>See? <br/>I could do another one. <br/>Probst: But worms weren't the only strange foods the tribes ate. ate. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Oh, my god. Frogs became a culinary island treat. <br/>Roasted frog. <br/>I ate the legs and a little bit of the ass, and now I'm craving frog. <br/>Did you eat the first one, dude? dude? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: And eating greens had  Probst: And eating greens had a whole new meaning. a whole new meaning. <br/>Good morning, guys. Got breakfast. <br/>Oh, look at that. <br/>Probst: The survivors even resorted to eating roots from resorted to eating  roots from the water. the water. <br/>With some lime juice. That would be good. <br/>Courtney, do you want some of this rice? <br/>I do. <br/>Did you guys just have this like, today, really? <br/>Is it okay? <br/>Probst: But nothing killed appetites more than spoiled rice. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Oh, my gosh. This is so nasty. This is so nasty. <br/>The mother lode! <br/>Probst: And even clams were questionable...  I don't think these things are cooked all the way. <br/>What? <br/>All right, you eat it, then. <br/>You think I'm not going to eat that? <br/>Probst: ...which caused a lot of bickering. <br/>Just like with the damn rice. I said the rice is bad, don't eat it. <br/>You did not say the rice is bad. Shut up, dude. If somebody said the rice was bad, I wouldn't have eaten it. <br/>The survivors searched everywhere...  Yes, dig for dinner. <br/>Probst: ...for anything remotely edible. <br/>Have y'all eaten one of these  Have y'all eaten one of these things? things? <br/>It's like, "Hey, he'll try it."  After eating frog, I guess  After eating frog, I guess I'll eat anything, huh? I'll eat anything, huh? <br/>Probst: At the first immunity challenge, lack of food and sleep didn't fare  well for Zhan Hu. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: And Fei Long prevailed. Fei Long wins immunity! That night, at tribal council, Zhan Hu decided who was their weakest link. First person voted out of Survivor: China,Chicken. <br/>Damn! <br/>Probst: The next day at Fei Long, Todd and Amanda formed an alliance. <br/>You're my long alliance, too. <br/>Okay. <br/>You have to have one in this game. You have to. <br/>Probst: And Aaron asserted himself as the leader, calling out Jean-Robert. <br/>Jean-Robert, you need to start pulling your weight. <br/>I know that I'm not working as much as I'd like to be able to work. My brain's working, but my body's just not able to move with it. I wanted to give the perception that I was a little bit lazy, so later on  when I am contributing and putting in the work effort, you know, people are  noticing. <br/>Probst: But after a short time, Aaron's actions caused people to question his  people to question his leadership abilities. leadership abilities. <br/>I thought you were supposed to be doing something. I thought y'all were supposed to be doing something. We need to do the roof and get some fire. <br/>Yeah. We tried and I couldn't do it. <br/>So y'all going to stop? Dude! You're killing me. <br/>Can you get fire? Can you get fire? <br/>You can. We probably can together. You're supposed to be the damn leader. Y'all are killing me. Y'all are killing me. The only reason why stuff gets done is I don't want to sleep on... get rained  on. I can't do all this stuff by myself. No, I'm not. We're the only two to actually do physical activity. We've got a stewardess, we've got two older ladies that don't do much. We've got a boy... he's a card player, dude. He came out here in Louis Vittons. <br/>James comes marching down and, "Aaron, you're supposed to be a leader. You're supposed to be showing us what to do, and you're down here taking a nap."  And I'm, like, thinking he's yelling at me at first. I looked over at him, and he's like, "You're just a flight attendant. I'm talking about him, our leader." And I was like, "Okay, let him  get ripped up," you know? <br/>You have to help. You have to help me out. The rest of them, hey... you need to get your ass up. Come on. There's just too much delegating and a whole lot of nothing getting done. Now, I'm not going to do this by myself anymore. They're going to pull the rope with me or they're all going to die. die. I'll move in that cave. I'll move in that cave. <br/>Probst: Up next, Todd calls out Jean-Robert. <br/>Do you have a problem with me, John-Robert? <br/>Absolutely not. <br/>That's not what I've heard. <br/>Todd. <br/>What? <br/>First of all, fix your tone. <br/>No. <br/>Fix your tone. <br/>Fix your tone. <br/>No. <br/>No. <br/>Probst: At the next reward challenge... Go! ...Fei Long rolled to their second straight victory... Fei Long wins! ...and a major element of the game was revealed. Fei Long, because you defeated Zhan Hu, you now get to kidnap one member of  their tribe. That person will come and live with you until the next immunity challenge. Who are you going to kidnap? <br/>Jaime. <br/>Probst: There's one more layer to this twist. Jaime, this is for you. It says, "Open in private." When you get to their beach, find a  private spot and read it. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: And if losing wasn't bad enough, Zhan Hu was hit even harder when  they returned to camp. <br/>It looks like a natural disaster hit our camp. This is basically destroyed. <br/>It was like somebody just took all the water from every ocean they could find  and just poured it right on top of us. <br/>Probst: And they quickly devised a plan to restore their camp. <br/>I'm going in, I'm getting the machete and I'm cutting a channel. <br/>Yeah, it was pretty disheartening. My first reaction was just, "Oh, brother. Here we go, something else to worry about." But, you know, when there's  a problem, you can only spend so much time being worried about it. You really have to just, "All right, let's fix it."  If you can at least cut through some of those fibers and those roots. <br/>Oh, there you go, there you go! There it is. <br/>Are they coming yet? <br/>Yeah, it's starting. <br/>Great effort. We're digging channels, trying to get our different plateaus to drain. We have three plateaus here at our camp, and the top one's draining into our  living one, which is draining into our bamboo prep fields, which is then  tumbling two meters down then tumbling two meters down into the lake. into the lake. <br/>Hopefully, we'll be able to get this really dry and finally have a  comfortable camp that's not wet and muddy, so... The water is actually  starting to flow now, so I think it's actually working. <br/>Probst: That same day at Fei Long, Jaime found a quiet place to open the  bamboo tube. <br/>"In this sealed tube is a clue to a hidden immunity idol at the enemy  camp. You must give the sealed clue to a member of the tribe." My strategy, as  far as the clue goes, is I'm going to give it to whom I think it is their  weakest link. <br/>Probst: In an attempt to be strategic, Jaime gave the clue to Leslie. Don't let anybody know you have it. <br/>Okay. I feel like the Lord really gave me a gift. <br/>Probst: Leslie formed an alliance of her own, hoping it would help keep her  in the game. <br/>I told Todd the idol is here, so we're going to team up and use it together. And I trust him. <br/>I can't believe she told me. I'm in shock! I would never tell anybody. I would never tell anybody. What was she thinking? What was she thinking? <br/>Probst: The next morning, Aaron woke everyone up and delivered some  surprising news. <br/>All right, so, making an announcement. It's been real, and it's been fun, but it hasn't been real fun. <br/>I just can't stand all the Brady Bunchantics that go on in this tribe. Aaron stood up this morning, put on his little suit and jacket with his  little powwow. Like, some of us haven't even taken our heads off the bamboo yet. <br/>I am now relinquishing my title as leader. I can't continue to, like, keep tabs on everyone else, and I don't want to  keep tabs on everyone else. But I've definitely enjoyed, you know, helping out, you know, with whatever  advice I can give, but I'm tired of making decisions. <br/>Aaron came up with this new brilliant idea-- "I'm relinquishing my  leadership position." What? <br/>All right, let's get some fire. so Amanda is on stairs. Jean-Robert, you're going to do logs with James later in the day. So does anyone know how to fish? <br/>"No, I'm not the leader," and right afterwards, he told us all  right afterwards, he told us all what to do. what to do. <br/>Probst: Over at Zhan Hu, Dave's lack of sleep was starting to affect him. <br/>I'm up first primarily because I got shuffled and squeezed out of every  comfortable sleeping position there is. And if no one can see I'm the tallest person around here, that's starting to  get under my skin a little bit. Hello. You know? <br/>Probst: And Dave expressed his views about eating before a challenge. <br/>We decided to do rice and just a little bit so it will boil faster. We don't know how much time we have to go before our challenge. <br/>I'll tell you, man, eating the rice right before a challenge, I don't know. I know that digestion diverts all your energy to your stomach. <br/>But we're all starving. <br/>I'm... I'm... watch this. Please, patience. <br/>You're so dramatic. <br/>Well, you know, I mentioned this so many times. And I have reasons for it. <br/>I think it's better to eat when you're starving before you have to exert  energy. <br/>My physiology, my metabolism is not yours. Whatever you guys need to feel better about it, if you feel better after a  meal, then by all means, cook the rice. <br/>If you don't want to eat, that's... Well, I don't think any of us need to eat  right now. I just think it's smart to. <br/>You guys know your bodies. You guys start yourselves up. I am not going to tell you what to do, what not to do in that respect. <br/>Dave hasn't been eating. He hasn't wanted to because he says his energy is high. He keeps telling everybody that he somehow gets magical energy from the air  and he doesn't need to eat. I think he'd be smarter than that. <br/>Good things come to those who wait. I don't like doing things half[1]assed. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, Dave ate his words, causing Zhan Hu to  lose. Fei Long wins immunity! When Zhan Hu returned to camp, Dave knew he was in the hot seat. <br/>I apologize. I feel like I let us down today. <br/>Start the fire. <br/>Let me finish. <br/>In the fireplace. <br/>Let me finish. <br/>Probst: And his constant bickering with Ashley...  You're the leader, and I'm going to let you do what you want. <br/>How many fires have you built, sweetheart? <br/>Probst: ...put them both in jeopardy. At tribal council, Ashley ended up getting the boot. up getting the boot. Ashley, the tribe has spoken. Ashley, the tribe has spoken. The next morning at Fei Long, The next morning at Fei Long, Leslie cleaned up  around camp. Leslie cleaned up around camp. <br/>Oh, they were? <br/>Oh, they were? Okay. Okay. <br/>This morning, I woke up, and I caught Leslie throwing away our bait. We caught it yesterday. We needed that today to catch the crabs and the fish. And she thought there were too many flies on it, so she threw all our food  away. I was in shock. I cannot believe how silly some I cannot believe how silly some people can be. people can be. <br/>Huh? Huh? Yeah. <br/>And I'm really sorry, I threw out those fish. I didn't realize we were going to use them for bait. <br/>And tried to find them, and I couldn't. Here's what I'm going to do. I know. I have a learning curve. I know. You can yell at me. You can scream at me. I'm going to go down and try to catch some more with the little net, okay? <br/>Uh-huh. She wakes me up this morning and tells me, "Oh, yeah, you need to go  fishing. I'm like, "Cool, whatever." "Oh, but I threw out the  bait." I don't understand that! I mean, that's amazing. I really would love to see how these people would be without me being here. It would be hilarious, because they honestly would be dead. They'd be in the little boat swimming, and would die of thirst and hunger and  just die and float off in the river. <br/>Probst: At the next immunity  Probst: At the next immunity challenge.... challenge.... <br/>Get that off my finger! <br/>Probst: Todd struggled with the puzzle. <br/>Move it from my face! <br/>Probst: Zhan Hu wins  Probst: Zhan Hu wins immunity! immunity! With Fei Long facing their first tribal council, Jean-Robert started placing  blame on others. <br/>What's on your mind regarding today's challenge? <br/>It's a strategy thing and we messed it up. It's that simple. <br/>You know, you guys said we're all promoting Todd to put the things in, so I  didn't want to get in his way, but I handed them all in the right places. It was a matter of going up or down. You know, it wasn't that complicated a puzzle. <br/>Did you... did you realize this and then...  I let Todd take the charge and he was doing it, and it looked like he was  doing just fine for a while. <br/>Now Jean-Robert is spinning it that Todd didn't do the puzzle right, so it's  always someone else besides him. But, like, I don't care. I'll vote for snoreface Jean-Robert because he annoys Jean-Robert because he  annoys the crap out of me. the crap out of me. <br/>Okay, I'm going to leave you guys. I just wanted to... I just wanted to...  Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: And Todd became very defensive. <br/>You have a problem with me, Jean-Robert, thinking I screwed up the puzzle or  something? <br/>Absolutely not. <br/>That's not what I've heard. <br/>So what did you hear? <br/>Someone said that you thought that I screwed up the puzzle. <br/>I didn't say any such thing. <br/>You've got to watch your mouth, dude. Word gets around. <br/>Todd, first of all, fix your tone. <br/>No. <br/>Fix your tone. <br/>Who said I said... James, were you here? Did I say he screwed up the puzzle? I'm asking you, James. You were here. Did I say he screwed up the puzzle? Amanda, did I say that Todd screwed up the puzzle? <br/>Amanda wasn't here. She was with me, dude. <br/>Aaron, did I say that Todd screwed up the puzzle? <br/>No. <br/>Thank you. So when you come confronting me, make sure you know what you're talking about. <br/>That's why I came straight to you, Jean-Robert. <br/>Okay, but you came to me with a tone. <br/>Okay, well, wouldn't you? <br/>Listen, we're all upset because we lost a challenge. <br/>Okay. <br/>So all I'm saying is what could we have done better? You, absolutely, were not even close to being one of the people accountable  for messing up today. <br/>All right, sorry for freaking on you. I just want to clear it out. <br/>All right. <br/>I get a little crazy like that, okay? <br/>Yeah, all right. <br/>So, of course, I run back to camp and kind of lose it on Jean-Robert for a  second, and I wanted to put him in his place and let him realize, "Yeah,  you know, I'm 150 pounds lighter than you, dude, but I have a very, very strong  opinion, and I'm going to knock you down if I have to."  This team hates to lose. <br/>Everybody gets kind of on edge. <br/>This team hates to lose. That's one good thing. <br/>Probst: But at tribal council, Fei Long kept Jean[1]Robert  for his strength. Third person voted out of Survivor: China... And Leslie was voted out. Up next:  If we lose, you're going home. That's not my call. <br/>Probst: Frosti gets handed an ultimatum. <br/>It's either we win and end up going really far in the game or going really  far in the game or lose and go home. lose and go home. <br/>Probst: By the morning of day ten, Courtney had reached her boiling point  with Jean-Robert. <br/>Don't touch that! <br/>Don't touch that! Don't touch that! Don't touch that! <br/>Okay, sorry. I was afraid it might be hot. <br/>He's, like, a cocky son of a bitch, and he sucks so bad. There's no getting out of that. <br/>Probst: Later that day at the immunity challenge... Sherea launches again! ...Sherea gave a brave performance. And scores! But her efforts were not enough... James connects again. ...as Fei Long won another challenge. [ cheers] After another loss, Sherea and Dave were at each other's Dave were  at each other's throats. throats. <br/>Sherea, please do not throw those away. <br/>I wish you would touch me. I wish... I wish you would touch me. <br/>I'm saving some of these shells. <br/>Back up off me. <br/>I'm saving...  Back up off of me. <br/>Would you please...  Back up off of me. <br/>If it were up to me, if we could get rid of both of them, it would be great. <br/>Do not walk up on me again. <br/>Probst: And at tribal council, Zhan Hu decided they'd had enough of Dave. Fourth person voted out of Survivor: China,Dave. <br/>Someone's coming in. <br/>Probst: On day 13, another twist was revealed. <br/>Ah! <br/>Fei Long, choose the two warriors from Zhan Hu who you feel could best help  to strengthen your tribe. <br/>Probst: The tribes were mixed up. Sherea and Frosti had to move to the Fei Long tribe. <br/>Hey, guys. <br/>Probst: And James and Aaron had to move to the Zhan Hu tribe. <br/>What's going on, guys? <br/>Hello. <br/>Probst: With the new tribes in place, Fei Long took some time to lighten  things up around camp. <br/>I... I... [ laughter]  But I don't... I don't know. <br/>I would have to say that... that... that... that... winning is... god, it's  so good! <br/>That was great. [ applause] [ laughter]  I don't even know how it started, but we started doing impressions. And we did Jean-Robert, and how he just likes to talk about himself, and Todd  stuck out his belly, how Jean-Robert does. And I was like, "Keep going, don't stop." This is what me and my  friends do at home. We sit around and we jaw on each other. That means talk about each other. <br/>You guys...  You guys, if we just work together...  I'm kind of like liking you. You're like, "Over on the other side over there, we wasn't eatin'  anything. There was... okay." [ laughter]  Oh, I know he ain't going to...  You put your one hand, and you shake your ass. <br/>People do say I walk like that. <br/>Denise-- "Oh, I don't care. Everybody get in the car. We go down to Salem, we get ourselves some Bud. I do some karate. I just don't care. I just don't care. At all, about anything." At all, about anything."  Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff... [ laughter] "We're team Abercrombie and Fitch, and you guys are  all, like, team you know, what's left." And then sometimes it's the one  eye, like, real open. "Okay." And the butt goes out more and more. It's the visible thinking. That's what gets me. It's, like, the visible thought process. And she's like... like when they finish the challenges, she's like... it  gets, like, more intense. She's like, "I'm ready to go." [ laughter] "I'm ready."  "Yo, when I compete, it's on." With her little boobies and her hot  pink bikini, and she bartends at a frat house. And it's like, "Can I order you online? Like, aren't there ads for you in the back of a magazine somewhere?"  Like, come on. <br/>Probst: But over at Zhan Hu, things were all business with things were all  business with Jaime and Peih-Gee. Jaime and Peih-Gee. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge...  Boys, take your time and just get your breath first. Wait a minute. Wait a long minute. <br/>Probst: Jaime and Peih-Gee's plan was set in motion. Fei Long wins immunity! And Aaron was the fifth person voted out of Survivor: China. The next day at the reward challenge... Fei Long wins reward. James was kidnapped by his old tribe. James, this is for you. Once back at Fei Long, James put his fate in Todd's hands. <br/>I know what they're talking about. It's those stupid bats above the freaking thing. <br/>Probst: Todd and Amanda found the hidden immunity idol, but Frosti  unexpectedly got involved. <br/>Hey, hey, hey, hey! All I could think was "Frosti, Frosti, no." So Todd and Amanda came  up with a new plan for James to take the immunity idol and throw the next  challenge in order to save challenge in order to save himself. himself. <br/>If you're running, trip. James loses immunity. They vote for him, but he uses the idol to get rid of Jaime. <br/>Probst: Then Todd told James about the second hidden immunity idol at the  Zhan Hu camp. <br/>All I have to do is stay focused, get the other idol and then I'll have both  of them. I mean, it's going to be wonderful. I'm having a great time. <br/>Probst: But with Frosti now in the mix, Todd and Amanda had to make a  foolproof plan. <br/>People have said if we lose, you're going home. That's not my call. So, I mean, it will... it will help, though, for you to fight even harder to  win, because it's either win and end up going really far in the game, or lose  and go home. Do you know what I mean? And I like you way too much to send you home. <br/>We're not trying to blackmail you. <br/>I promise I'm not. I promise I'm not trying to play godfather. I like you way too much to watch you go 11th place, dude. Way too much. If we lose today, Frosti knows he's going home, because he saw the hidden  immunity idol, and he knows our plan now, so we had to throw that blackmail  in his face and say "Look, this is how it is. You have an ultimatum-- win and stay, lose, go home."  How do you feel right now? <br/>Yeah, you look kind of dumbstruck. <br/>Well, I mean, you know I have to be on your side. <br/>Yeah. I trust you now, because... [ laughter]  That makes me sound horrible. <br/>We blackmailed Frosti because we don't want him giving any information to  Zhan Hu today, and with Frosti helping us win as much as he can, and James  helping Zhan Hu lose as much as he can, I'm pretty confident that we'll win  the challenge today. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge... Go. ...Frosti put his best foot forward in an effort to stay in the game. Frosti, he's licking the plate. Fei Long scores! These are chicken fetuses. Go. James spitting it back up. Denise is struggling. But Denise couldn't get her head around the task...  Sorry, James. <br/>Probst: ...ruining James' and Todd's perfect plan. <br/>I got it. <br/>Chew it! <br/>That's right, baby. <br/>Probst: James puts it all in his mouth. James scores for Zhan Hu. <br/>Genius idea. Smashed. <br/>Probst: That night at tribal council, Frosti's ongoing loyalty paid off. Sixth person voted out of Survivor: China. And Sherea was voted out. Even though James and Todd's plan didn't pan out, James' spirits were up when  he found the second hidden immunity idol. <br/>That's funny. I'm on Survivorwith two idols. <br/>Probst: Later that day, Jaime and Erik found a discarded plaque that James  had left behind. <br/>This used to be hanging on the archway. And it looks like someone took it off. <br/>It could definitely say, like, immunity idol in Chinese and I'd have no idea. It's a weird symbol, so I don't know what it stands for. <br/>Probst: James had to laugh when he noticed the plaque was gone. <br/>The thought of this woman having a blank one... that would be the best ever,  if she pulls out a blank thing and everyone's like, "What do you mean? It don't have the writing on there. You at least have to have something. One of these!"  Probst: That night when James was away from camp, Jaime decided to do some  snooping. But in the dark, she was unable to differentiate James's idols to differentiate  James's idols from her own. from her own. On day 20... Drop your buffs. ...the tribes merged. ...the tribes merged. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: ...and had a celebratory feast. <br/>Oh, my God! We get to eat! We get to eat! <br/>Yeah, girls! <br/>Yeah, girls! <br/>Probst: And the party carried  Probst: And the party carried on throughout the night. on throughout the night. <br/>Who is over there? Is that Erik and Jaime? Jamie, is that you? <br/>I'm not drunk, I'm not drunk. <br/>Jaime, is that you? <br/>No, this is Erik. <br/>Is that Erik? Erik, hey, what's up? <br/>Hey! <br/>You guys, I think we're on the last legs of this canteen. It's almost drained. Todd is definitely... Todd is done. <br/>I'm closing out Todd. I'm closing out Amanda. Courtney.... <br/>You guys, this is not good. <br/>Tonight at the feast, we had some, like, potent snake sake. I don't know what was in it, but it was really strong. You could feel it in burning in your mouth a few seconds after. <br/>This is like Survivor: the Musical. <br/>âª We live in the jungle in a tree  house With a leaking roof âª They have no tarp even though they won it even though they won  it but we have fire... âª but we have fire... âª  âª I haven't had snake wine  because I don't drink. âª  They sing when they're sober. They'll sing all day and all night. It's like a little musical over here. I knew the alcohol would only I knew the alcohol would only heighten it. heighten it. <br/>What? <br/>What? <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>The guys broke out the wine, and they've been sucking it down the last couple  hours and a couple of them are pretty tipsy right now. I'm a little older than the rest of the kids. I don't want to be having a hangover. But I think definitely Todd and definitely Amanda aren't going to be feeling  too well in the to be feeling too well in the morning. morning. <br/>Probst: On day 21, Jaime felt secure with her place in the game. <br/>If Todd sees me play the hidden immunity idol tonight, he's definitely going  to be floored. I think it's probably going to shock everyone, including Jeff. I'm not as dumb as I look, and maybe they're figuring it out. <br/>Probst: At tribal council, Jaime played what she thought was an immunity idol. <br/>I found this at camp lying on the floor. So I thought it might be immunity. <br/>Probst: This is not a hidden immunity idol. But her hopes were tossed aside. Seventh person voted out of Survivor: China,and the first member of our jury,  Jaime. Jaime, the tribe has spoken. And Jaime became the first member of the jury. Up next, Peih-Gee tries to make Up next, Peih-Gee tries to make amends. amends. <br/>You can accept it or not. <br/>No. <br/>But I really am sorry. <br/>You're really not. Please, stop messing with me and Please, stop messing with me and go sit down  somewhere else. go sit down somewhere else. <br/>Probst: On the morning of day 23, James took some time alone to clear his  thoughts. <br/>They're a bunch of late sleepers over here. They're just so tired. You've got to motivate yourself. I'm a grave digger. I've been doing it my whole life. My dad handed me a shovel at 11 and told me to start working. And that's all I've ever done. All I do is work. I'm used to being in the hot sun with a shovel in my hand. And over here, there's nothing for me to do but, you know, provide. I like cooking. I like catching fish. I love providing for people. I mean, that's what I do. It's one of the reasons I'm still here. I mean, granted, the two idols I do have are a big part of it, but I make  life easy over here. I am that guy who's been kind of the glue of the alliance. I feel like I am the one who is holding everybody together. It's just right there. It's so simple. All we have to do is stick together, and we'll be there. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, Courtney was the last one sitting. Courtney wins immunity! Facing tribal council, Erik filled Jean-Robert in on the secret behind the  immunity idols. <br/>We looked in James' bag and there were two of them. <br/>Wow. This is the guy favored to win every challenge from here out. <br/>Probst: So Jean-Robert confronted James. <br/>You have two immunity idols? Two of them and you can't tell your boy? Nobody told me, bro. ...is the realization that you're holding out on me. you're holding out on me. That's what I came up with. That's what I came up with. <br/>Probst: Jean-Robert came up with a plan to take out his closest ally. We could blindside him tonight, because he will not pull out the idol tonight. <br/>Let's see how it goes tonight. I was kind of bothered by the fact he's coming up with all these ideas that  I've had for days now. <br/>Probst: But Todd turned the tables on Jean-Robert. <br/>I think our best bet is...  I don't want to break the system, but...  Do we want to tell Denise or no? <br/>No-- hell no! <br/>Probst: But at tribal council, James took the risk of not using one of his  idols... James. ...and almost paid the price. James received three votes. One vote left. But in the end, Jean-Robert with five votes was dealt a losing hand. Jean-Robert, the tribe has Jean-Robert, the tribe has spoken. spoken. At the reward challenge, Peih[1]Gee  was captain of the red team, Erik captain of the yellow. Go. Peih-Gee's team dropped the ball. James, too hard, Peih-Gee can't get it. And Erik's team bounced to victory. Frosti, Amanda, Erik, and Courtney, cruising down the river. <br/>All right, everyone, cheers to us. <br/>Probst: During the cruise, Courtney grew closer to Frosti. <br/>I love my Frosti. I love my Frosti. <br/>Probst: Back at camp, Peih-Gee blamed James for losing Peih-Gee blamed James  for losing the challenge. the challenge. That's why y'all lose. You're quick to blame. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I can finish? Can I please finish? <br/>No, you can't, because I don't care. <br/>You know, I need to take a walk right now. <br/>Peih-Gee, she's just stupid. <br/>Probst: After she cooled off,  Probst: After she cooled off, Peih-Gee tried to make amends. Peih-Gee tried to make amends. <br/>No, you're not. Don't politic. <br/>I'm not politicking. I'm apologizing. So you can accept it or you're not, but I really am sorry, okay? <br/>No, you're not. You're really not. <br/>Please stop messing with me and go sit down somewhere else. <br/>No, I came up to apologize. I didn't come out to fight with you some more, okay? <br/>Well, obviously, you did. <br/>You know what? Listen, that's cool. You're not in the mood to accept my apology, that's fine. I can understand that. <br/>I know what kind of person You are, and this is just a bunch of fluff, and I  really don't like fluff. I'm not a fluff person. <br/>James.... <br/>I'm really not. <br/>After losing the reward challenge, I was really pissed to have lost, but I  shouldn't have taken it out on James. So, I don't know. I'm in, like, a really bad position. <br/>Probst: But at the immunity challenge... Peih-Gee wins immunity. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: ...Peih-Gee narrowly beats Frosti. With Peih-Gee immune, the former Fei Long saw Frosti as the biggest threat. <br/>He's got to go before Erik. <br/>He's got to go before Erik. <br/>Has to go. <br/>Has to go. <br/>Probst: And Todd tried to  Probst: And Todd tried to sway Courtney's decision. sway Courtney's decision. <br/>Frosti's kind of like my little munchkin. And everyone's kind of worried about me because they know he's, you know,  like, my good friend. <br/>Probst: That night at tribal council... Ninth person voted out and the third  member of our jury... ...Todd's efforts paid off. Frosti, the tribe has spoken. All right. Tonight, you will not be heading Tonight, you will not be heading directly  back to camp. directly back to camp. We have more business to attend We have more business to attend to here. to here. <br/>Probst: Where 16 once stood, only seven remain. How will James choose to use his two immunity idols? <br/>I have the big joker and the little joker, so I'm going to be here for a  while, so you might as well go on and get comfortable. <br/>Probst: What new adventures will the survivors face? What future twist will the challenges bring? Today, you are playing for.... <br/>What? <br/>Probst: Join us as the adventure continues.

A twist at tribal council catches everyone off guard. We have more business to attend to here. And Amanda turns on her alliance. <br/>Fei Long is not together  Fei Long is not together anymore. anymore. <br/>That is not a new style for Denise. I believe that the USA hockey team is missing a player. I mean, the flight attendant voice is getting to me. You can almost hear everyone opening their little bag of peanuts every time  he says something. Peih-Gee seems kind of smug, like, "Yum, I love me some pig  knuckles." Any guy who shows up to the middle of the jungle in a silk  shirt and no underpants, you've shirt and no underpants, you've got to wonder  about that guy.
