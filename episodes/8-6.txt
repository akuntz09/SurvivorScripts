<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor:At the reward  challenge, the tribes faced the first big twist of the game. The losing tribe will not return back to your beach. The tribe members will be absorbed by the two remaining tribes. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: The tribes battled to keep themselves together,  but it was Mogo Mogo who cruised to an easy first place finish. Mogo Mogo wins reward. Giving them first pick from the losing Saboga tribe. In a strategic move, Mogo Mogo picked Ethan and brought Jerri  along for the ride. <br/>The biggest reward was dismantling Saboga. <br/>Probst: And Chapera chose Rupert and Jenna. <br/>Welcome aboard. <br/>Probst: At Chapera, Rupert and Jenna were happy to have a  new home. <br/>Our camp was Hobo Junction. Theirs is the Taj Mahal. <br/>Probst: Things got physical when the two tribes battled  for immunity. <br/>Come on, Sue, you got it. <br/>Sue, get up there. <br/>I want this one. Come on, baby. <br/>Probst: And Sue had a close encounter with Richard. Guys, come on. As Boston Rob led the new Chapera tribe to victory. Before Tribal Council, the scramble was on when Colby suddenly  changed the plan to vote out Ethan. <br/>Richard's the one we've we've got to get rid of. He's a cancer in this tribe. <br/>Probst: When Richard found out, he teamed up with the  girls to foil Colby's plan. <br/>How dare you approach somebody to get rid of me? You must go bye-bye now. <br/>Probst: And Kathy found herself caught in the middle. <br/>Give me ten minutes. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Colby spoke out. <br/>You cannot coast, although a lot of people are doing it. <br/>Probst: And proved he was a power to be reckoned with when  his plan succeeded. The fifth person voted out of Survivor: All-Stars,Rich. <br/>I've been bamboozled. <br/>Probst: The first Survivor winner, Richard Hatch, was  voted out. <br/>Food, food...  Probst: 15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION  Last night was the biggest scramble at the last minute as  Richard Hatch was scurrying about trying to save his own butt. Right as we were leaving for Tribal Council, we grabbed our  torches and I looked at Kathy and I said, "Who are we voting for?"  And she said "Hatch."  I have some questions for you Kath. <br/>Yes, darling. <br/>What happened last night? <br/>Yeah. <br/>The decision last night at Tribal for me was I could have  swung Shii Ann and Jerri to vote for Colby. Instead, I decided to stay with what Colby wanted, which was to  vote Richard Hatch off. <br/>He's the Richard Hatch now of the group. <br/>Don't give me that loyalty ..., Colby. I tried to put together my gut instincts about what it was going  to be like to come back to the tribe, having made that big decision to oust  Colby without consulting with Lex. I just think the repercussion would put a schism between myself  and Lex, and Lex would feel totally betrayed. And I know Lex. He then would never trust me, so in the 11th hour, I decided to  vote for Richard Hatch. I saved Colby's ass. I made it look like we saved him. <br/>You're so powerful right now. Kathy's the biggest power player of all. She's got all of us wrapped around her fingers. And if nobody's noticing that, she's one darn good player. <br/>That's where you put the strap in? <br/>Uh-huh. See, and it's such a good spear it's already drawn blood on me,  so I know it's going to draw blood on fish. <br/>That's good. <br/>Hell, yeah. I love that. <br/>To be honest with you, it put pressure on me when Rupert  and Jenna come because it threw another cog in the game, but I really like  old Rupert. He's kind of like me, he's easygoing, nothing don't bother him. And I know it may cost me down the road because, you know, he  could easily take my place. I wonder if down here in this little cove right here, it'll be  shallower. <br/>The role of provider is wide open here. I like the fact that none of them could fish. <br/>Rupert? <br/>Yeah? <br/>You want them both? <br/>Ah, good. A few of them would eat the snails, that attach to the sides of  the rock, but I want to be the guy that brings, you know, a couple of dozen  oysters and a couple fish in every day. <br/>You want help picking those up? <br/>No. I'm doing all right, man. We're never going to take them all anyway. You always got to leave some back so the other guys know where  to come. <br/>Sue is playing her own game. <br/>[ humming tune]  She wants to be that provider, but the only meat that  she's providing right now are those cone snails, which I think most of the  people eat. <br/>First, nobody likes these damn things. Now everybody likes them. It sort of pisses me off because I'm not eating the rice. Oh, recollect. <br/>I want to catch some fish. Grizzly Adams out there trying to pretend like he's a big man. He brought home two little fish the whole time he's been here. Rupert's catching fish-- I'm happy. He can continue to feed me until it's time for him to go, and  that time will be determined by me. So he'd better catch a lot of fish, keep my belly full. <br/>My strategy of fish, keep my belly full. <br/>My strategy of flying under the radar was pointed out by  Colby last night, which by the way, was not the smartest move on his part, to  say, "Well, those who are flying under the radar are not going to get by  me." I felt like that was a direct attack at me. <br/>Shii Ann, you've said before, you know, you guys just tell  me what we're doing and I'm good with that. I didn't have any respect for that game plan the first time I  played this game. It's just very easy to allow someone else to be the bad guy. And yesterday, that was me. <br/>You think you were the bad guy yesterday? <br/>Ultimately I ended up almost getting chopped because I sat  up on that hill and told Ethan he had nothing to worry about, that we were  going for Richard. And then I came down and lied right to Richard's face and told  him the same thing. Someone like you doesn't have to lie this entire game because  you don't make a decision. It's very easy to sit in a tent, wait until an hour before  Tribal Council for someone to walk in and tell you who we're voting for and  say, "Okay, I'll go along with that." Man, that's an easy game to  play. That's an easy game to make it a long way. I don't have had any respect for that. If that's your game, that's a very brilliant game. It will work, but you can't...  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Lecture, lecture, lecture. Captain America with his good teeth, nice smile, handsome guy. I'm just like... [ snoring]. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you done? <br/>Everyone's got to play...  I agree. <br/>...and it takes more than just showing up and writing a  name on a ticket to be a player in this game, as far as I'm concerned. <br/>He doesn't respect my game-- I don't necessarily respect  his. We're equal. But I'm not dumb enough to tell him that. <br/>Which one looks like a lucky coconut? This one. <br/>Can you imagine us going into a merge seven to four? <br/>That'd be great. <br/>Even seven to five. I'd be thrilled. It guarantees us all seven at least. <br/>We're kind of sitting back and watching what's going on and  waiting to go see what happens. We don't really know Jenna and Rupert all that well. We haven't played with them. They just came into this tribe a few days ago. Now we won the first immunity challenge against Mogo Mogo since  we've formed seven in each tribe. Be interesting to see who they vote off. <br/>Yeah. Hell, yeah. <br/>The next thing that we want to see is who gets voted out. They had to go to Tribal Council. Who'd they vote out? <br/>I think Jerri's gone. <br/>They may be tired of old Hatch. I would be. <br/>I wish. <br/>Richard probably is making them insane. I would do my damnedest to have him voted off the first time we  lost. <br/>Oh, I hope they vote him off, you guys. If Ethan's getting fish, I hope to God they vote him off. I still can't... they better talk to Richard about what he did  to me at that challenge. <br/>That was tough. <br/>Anything that Richard could have done... was, like, what  he does, he does all the time-- he just gets naked. Well, at this point, we're over it. So yesterday, what happened at the challenge, he throws his  hands up in the air and thrusts his hips and starts rubbing himself on me. He does not deserve to be here. Anybody that's won, as far as I'm concerned, Ethan and, like,  Rich should be the first ones to go. <br/>Yes. <br/>Oh, I will go hug them all. <br/>Nights are really long here. They're like 12 hours long. It's awful. All night I laid there thinking every time I woke up, I could  re-feel Richard naked. It kept flashing through my head. And I started feeling really bad. Like why did he have to touch me? He didn't touch nobody else. Why didn't he just walk by me? <br/>You know why, 'cause Why didn't he just walk by me? <br/>You know why, 'cause the more she thinks about it, she's  like, "My husband's going to know about this." He's going to freak  out. I mean it's not a good scenario for her. <br/>She probably wants to be alone right now, huh? <br/>This morning when we woke up, Sue was not herself. I didn't realize how much she had been affected by what happened  to her until she started to cry. It's affecting us because it's affecting you, but we're all  right. I mean, we're more worried about you than anything, do you know  what I mean? <br/>I mean, it's, like, gross. I've been with one partner for 20 years. Never even thought about kissing another guy. <br/>There was nothing you could do, Sue. You know he's not going to be mad at you. <br/>There's something I can do and I ain't going to get it  done laying on this beach. <br/>You need to get it all out, Sue. Just be mad, be upset. She just couldn't control her tears, and she couldn't control  her anger. It's really hard to try to console somebody who feels that way. There was nothing I can do. <br/>I think sleeping on it, she must have thought about it all  night last night. <br/>Yeah, she did. She's thinking about her husband and she's really upset about  it. <br/>It's like another one of those situations, Amber, where,  like, you don't know... is she just ... around because like, she's a smart  player and she's trying to get some money out of this, she wants to sue him  or is like, just something that's really bothering her? But a situation this serious, you can't even screw around. You got to give her the benefit of the doubt. Sue is either, A] Looking to cash in on a huge payday-- sue the  ... out of Richard Hatch; Or Sue is really emotionally distraught by the  whole thing. Or Sue's using this as some kind of a leverage to play the game  of Survivor. Nobody knows what Sue's thinking except Sue. <br/>I think it's just gotten worse and worse in her head as  it's gone along. I think maybe at first she was thinking, oh, you know, I can get  him for this. But now it's really starting to bother her. As the day went on, she had more and more time to think about  it. And when you're out here playing this game, your mind does crazy  things. And so I think that just made the situation worse. I think if we were in another situation not even playing  Survivorand that would have happened, it might not have been as big as a deal  maybe as it turned out to be. <br/>You hungry, Sue? You want to cook those eyeballs up? <br/>No. <br/>You holler when you want to cook them-- we'll cook them up  and fry them up. Sue was distant, nonresponsive, throwing in the towel. Are you okay? At the time of the challenge and all the contact and all that  with Richard, Sue could have handled it different. She could have stopped right then and said "foul."  Instead, she turns her head, says, "Oh, that's gross," and goes on. Thinks about it, processes it, comes up with her own agenda, and  goes on with that. <br/>You can't argue her point. I don't feel what she's feeling. I don't. I mean, it didn't happen to me. I couldn't possibly understand how... She's humiliated. She feels completely humiliated. <br/>That's right. <br/>Earlier, Sue was vital to this tribe that we couldn't get  rid of her. But I want it to be known right up, by God, I don't need her. She's very overbearing, and in my opinion, if it was up to old  jungle cat, I say stick a fork in her, she's done. <br/>What I'm doing is I'm making a grocery list. It's ending up being pretty much all sweet, but I've got... I  started off pretty healthy. Coming from Saboga, we really had a food advantage on our  island. We had an endless supply of plantains, tons of coconuts. And then I get here to Mogo Mogo and all they have right now is  rice. I need honey-roasted extra crunchy peanut butter, Peanut Butter  Crunch, marshmallows, big and small. Bananas, apples... gala apples. <br/>I hate talking about food this early in the game. It drives me crazy because then all after sudden I have this  mirage in my brain, you know, of just this big giant ice cream sundae. It doesn't make me feel good to get cravings. <br/>Milk chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, marshmallow  creme, graham crackers with cinnamon...  I am a little bit concerned about the food situation. I don't like the fact that our main food provider got voted out  because I knew every day he'd bring back a fish. Oh, Richard Hatch, I miss you already. Where is the fish? <br/>I actually thought about that this morning. I thought about getting up and going out with a sling. <br/>You haven't tried it yet, have you? <br/>Not here, no. I want to. I really wanted to wait until Richard was out of the picture  before I picked up the spear because I didn't want it to be a competitive  thing. I knew that Richard was really kind of territorial with the  whole fishing chore, and that was fine. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Easy. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Easy. <br/>Yes! <br/>He's a natural. <br/>I wanted to take on the fisherman's role. However, I didn't try to fish today. I'm sitting back a little bit, you know, I let him do it all  today. <br/>Sharp shooter. We should have gotten rid of Richard a long time ago. <br/>I didn't think it was necessary to let everyone know that  I was an accomplished fisherman. I think kind of holding your cards a little closer is always a  good idea in Survivor. <br/>Yay, the heroes. It's so funny. You guys look like the guys have been out for days getting food. <br/>I got three or four different kinds. There's some small ones for flavor. <br/>Oh, my God, Lex! They're awesome. Look at them all laid out. It's like a trophy room. <br/>Wow. Lex is a competitor. This is not his first rodeo, as we say in Texas. Because of his ability to fish, that is something you check in  the back of your mind knowing that ultimately I'm competing against Lex. Wow. <br/>What a treat, getting a taste of all these different kinds  of fish. <br/>I know. It's fun. <br/>I think that I've got the favor of the girls right now. If I can show them that I can provide them with food, there's no  reason for them to feel any compulsion to keep the other two guys around. <br/>I came in yesterday, felt like a sacrificial lamb. <br/>Right. <br/>Like, just, I felt Rupert can get you guys food and stuff,  but, like, if you guys are serious...  No, we're dead serious because me and Rob want to save our  asses. Like, I'm trying to save my ass but I know Sue wants to get rid  of me. Rob and I came up with the idea to approach Rupert and Jenna,  tell them that you know, we think we're on the outs, we think we're in  trouble. We'll save you if you save us. <br/>But what makes us believe that you guys aren't coming to  us like Alicia came to you? <br/>What would we have to lose by coming to you, you know? <br/>I don't know. <br/>Momentum is huge in this game. When you have it, you want to keep it. Rupert has a squeaky clean image and attitude. There's something about him I just don't trust, so I, uh, I  formed an alliance with him. <br/>We are taking a huge risk at you guys going back and  telling the other guys. <br/>No, trust me. I'd much rather go in with you guys. <br/>But I just, and I felt that you guys would hopefully want  to go with us. <br/>Yes. No, we do. <br/>Hell, yes. <br/>When I first started this Survivor: AllStarand I hear  people talking and you know saying that they want to help me, or saying that  they want me on their side, I couldn't trust any of them. Now after 16 days, I know that I can trust Jenna, I hope that I  can trust Rob and Amber. I feel pretty confident with where I'm at. <br/>If you honestly honor your alliance, you go to the end, no  matter what. But always somebody, like, gets greedy at one point. Once it gets to the final four, then we can, you know, every man  for themselves. <br/>Exactly. <br/>You got to look at me. <br/>I'm cool with it if you guys are cool with it. You have my word. <br/>I'm beautiful with it. <br/>All right, done. I've got alliances with everybody now, except Sue and Alicia. I mean, we can turn around tomorrow and kick Jenna and Rupert  off. They can be here as sacrificial lambs. We've got to see what's going on. It's my game, buddy. <br/>Why do we have tree mail? <br/>"You'll do some highstepping while rewards sail  through the sky, so wave your hands and stomp your feet. Your taste buds will tell you why." This is coffee in here,  by the way. [ sniffing] Smell. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>We could try to make coffee with this. <br/>Oh, my God, I'd be up for five days. I've been dying all day today to be alone with Lex for a few  minutes, just to kind of put things in order. Listen, Lex, I just want you to know, you can trust me. <br/>Okay. <br/>150,000%. <br/>Okay. <br/>I absolutely adore you. <br/>Okay. And you know I trust you, too. <br/>Good. And I want you to. <br/>I do. <br/>Because I, personally, out of everybody here, would love  to go with you. <br/>I appreciate that, Jerri. The conversation I had with Jerri was completely sincere. I don't have any reason to feel that it was anything but. But I am going to do whatever it takes to get me further in the  game, and that if that means exploiting situations where I have a friend that  might trust me, I'll do it. It's business this time. <br/>What if the reward challenge was a grill and seasonings  and some meat...  Some seasonings? <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>And a bottle of wine. <br/>And a bottle of wine. <br/>Two bottles of wine. <br/>Five bottles. <br/>Five bottles of wine. <br/>That'd be the best reward right now. <br/>Every day, we talk about food out here because as good as  the rice is, it's terrible. And it has there has to be some light at the end of the tunnel. We're starving over here. <br/>Are you hungry, Sue? <br/>No. <br/>That's coming from a guy who's been fighting with her from  day one. <br/>Yeah, it is. I hate it. <br/>Sue is Sue. She will endure and pursue her own agenda. She doesn't give a damn about what anybody else is doing. Ultimately, Sue having her own agenda, will hinder her. It alienates her from the tribe. <br/>How do we make it back again? <br/>We are going to win. <br/>We win and we eat. <br/>We're going to win. <br/>We support her 100%, but we're also thinking this puts us  in a bad place as a tribe. We still have to play this game. <br/>Probst: Come on in, Chapera. Mogo Mogo, come on in. You're getting your first look at the new Mogo Mogo tribe. Richard Hatch voted out at last night's Tribal Council. <br/>Good move. <br/>Probst: Before we get to today's challenge, I want to  address something that happened yesterday. Richard Hatch, sort of being inappropriate...  Sort of, yeah. <br/>Probst: Anybody have any comments? <br/>I was sexually violated. To have some guy come up... He passed a half dozen people on  platforms and never touched them. <br/>Probst: Sue, I'm...  And it went too far and he crossed the line, and he  crossed the line with me. <br/>Probst: Well...  SUE: Okay, I know you don't know, and you didn't see it  because his back was to you and he's too big of a ... slob to see around. I was violated, humiliated, dehumanized and totally spent, Jeff. It wasn't "sort of," Jeff 'cause his back was to you,  Jeff. That's all I'm saying and I'm ... spent and I'm done with this  ... game. There's no way I can continue with my ... emotions pushed to the  ground that much. <br/>Probst: So... Okay, so you're... when you say you're done  with the game, as in you want out of the game? <br/>I'm done. I'm walking away. <br/>Probst: Let me ask you guys, did anything come up at your  camp about it? <br/>No, we... I...  I didn't know what happened. <br/>Probst: You didn't see it? <br/>We didn't even notice. <br/>It was all done in front of our platform. <br/>Yeah, I saw it, Sue. And the thing is, trust me, you know from the first season,  maybe you guys don't, living with a guy being naked sucks 'cause he's naked  all the time. <br/>I didn't give a ... if he was naked, if he had just walked  by me and never ... touched me, I'd have been fine, but he didn't, that's the  ... point. <br/>Probst: Does it have any impact that he's out of the game  or not? <br/>No, I-I... No, my mind's ... left this game 24 hours ago. <br/>Probst: Let's, uh... if we can, bring in this boat, ASAP. <br/>I'm so sorry, Sue. I'm so sorry. I didn't see him... I'm so sorry. <br/>You guys, good luck. <br/>We love you. [ indistinct talking] [ engine puttering]  Boy, is that discouraging. <br/>Probst: Okay. I'll tell you what I suggest, you tell me what you want to do. Here are the two options-- we continue, we play the reward,  winner takes all, just like always. Or we forego the reward, you guys can sit down here and talk  about it and we'll split this up, you can take it back to camp with you and  eat on your own. You tell me what you want to do. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Maybe we should sit down and all share the food and fix  animosity between two tribes, instead of playing. <br/>No, let's play. We're here to play. <br/>I say we play it. <br/>We want to play. <br/>We want to play. <br/>It's been a long night, long day. <br/>Let's get back to some normalcy. <br/>Let's have some fun. <br/>Probst: So the decision is...  We're going to play. <br/>Probst: Play on. All right, it's been an odd 16 days...  Yeah. <br/>Probst: ...but let's get to today's reward challenge. Fortunately, it's fun, it's reward, it's for food. Here's how it's going to work. You're going to be stomping items into a basket eight feet in  the air. Each tribe will have a basket. Underneath the basket is an adjustable plank. One tribe member at a time, you'll put one food item on one end  of the plank, you'll stomp on it. That'll catapult it into the air and hopefully into the basket. Each tribe member is responsible for one item going in that  basket. You can't move on until that person has achieved that goal. Here are the six items-- there's sugar, pineapple, mixed nuts,  coffee, oranges, and beef. First tribe to get all six items in their basket wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah, definitely. <br/>Yeah, please. <br/>Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. <br/>Probst: Hopefully you'll like it. [ cheering]  Shish kabob! <br/>Shish kabob! <br/>Meat. <br/>Probst: They're very nice. You got some filet mignon, you got some peppers. You have some mushrooms and some red onion and also some  utensils. In addition, the winning tribe keeps everything in the basket. <br/>Oh, yes. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>Oh, we've got to win. <br/>That's it. <br/>Probst: We're even up six, six, that means everybody  competes. Get your order, wait for my go. [ cheering]  Mogo Mogo! <br/>Here we go, Tommy, here we go! <br/>Probst: For reward, survivors ready? Go! [ cheering]  Yeah, Ethan. You got it, baby. <br/>Probst: Ethan and Big Tom. Allies from Africa. Ooh, Ethan just overshoots it. Big Tom is in on his first toss. [ Tom shouts indistinctly]  Yeah, good job. <br/>Probst: Ethan's in on his second. We're tied up 1-1. Jenna and Shii Ann. <br/>Turn your board over, Shii Ann. <br/>Come on, Jenna. <br/>Make sure it's in a groove. Shii Ann.... oh! So close. [ indistinct shouting]  Move forward, Jenna. <br/>Probst: Shii Ann hits for Mogo Mogo. Mogo Mogo 2, Chapera 1. Jenna still just missing to the right. Jerri... oh! In and out. Lips it. <br/>Line the board that way! <br/>Probst: Jenna getting a little help from her tribe mates--  adjust the aim. <br/>You're all right, Jerri. <br/>Probst: That's three for Mogo Mogo. Wait till she gets back. <br/>Forget the hat! Colby up for Mogo Mogo. Mogo Mogo 3, Chapera one. Shish kabob at stake. Jenna... no. <br/>Jenna, way over. All the way over. <br/>Nice and straight, Jenna. <br/>You got it. <br/>That's it, go! <br/>Move the board! Move the board! <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Probst: Just... And Mogo Mogo's in with four items. [ cheering]  Come on, Jenna. Let's go, let's go, let's go. <br/>... it. <br/>Here we go, here we go. Game on. <br/>Probst: Jenna hits it for Chapera with the one-legged  stomp. <br/>...  Probst: Boston Rob trying to make up some time. <br/>There you go. Don't worry about it. <br/>Probst: Mogo Mogo with four, Chapera with two. <br/>Go, Kathy. <br/>You got it, Kathy. You got it. You got it, Kathy. <br/>Probst: Kathy... just misses for Mogo Mogo. <br/>Come on, Rob. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob nails it for Chapera. Kathy nails it for Mogo Mogo. We're at five, three. Go, go. Lex with the last item for Mogo Mogo. If he gets the beef in, it's reward for Mogo Mogo. <br/>Come on, Alicia! <br/>Probst: Alicia trying to catch up for Chapera. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: One toss... just over. Alicia hits it on her first shot. <br/>Come on, Alicia. <br/>Probst: Chapera with four. Mogo Mogo with five. Amber's going to have to make up a lot of time. Lex can win it for Mogo Mogo with this. [ Jerri screaming] He just misses. [ people shouting]  Probst: And with that, Mogo Mogo wins reward. [ cheering]  Whoo! <br/>Good try, Amber. [ cheering and hooting]  Probst: All right, Mogo Mogo, utensils. <br/>Barbecue. [ Shii Ann screaming]  Probst: Take these. <br/>Oh! <br/>Big smell. <br/>Probst: And the main course...  Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: ...shish kebobs. Sadly, Chapera, nothing for you. <br/>Whatever. <br/>Probst: Been an eventful day? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yup. <br/>Probst: Tomorrow's another day. <br/>Right. <br/>Probst: You guys can head back to camp. <br/>Thank you. [ cheering and shouting]  Mogo Mogo! Yeah! [ hooting]  All I know is tonight we ain't talking about it. We're eating it. <br/>We're eating it. <br/>That's right. <br/>We got these seven kebabs of filet mignon. We just couldn't wait to put it on that fire and start grilling  it up. <br/>It sounds good. <br/>It does. <br/>Oh, yeah, baby, look at this. <br/>The steak kebabs were more delectable than... Excuse me  while I clear the saliva out of my mouth. <br/>How is it, Ethan? Is it cooked enough, buddy? <br/>Yeah, I mean I don't even... I can't tell you the last  time I had a steak or meat or anything. <br/>How come? You don't eat meat? <br/>Uh-uh. <br/>Yeah, you do today. <br/>It was good. I just wanted to rub my face in it. I wanted to sleep next to it. Oh! <br/>To a great win. <br/>Mm-hmm. Hear, hear. <br/>Unbelievable team. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I hope there's no ill will on the other side because we  didn't take any of the stuff and share it. <br/>They wanted to play. <br/>Yeah? <br/>Well, that's the thing, is-is having Sue leave and then  losing the challenge, they're going back somewhat demoralized, yeah. <br/>No, no, yeah, that's... Yeah, it's going to hurt them. <br/>It's a good thing Rich wasn't here. <br/>Oh. I don't even want to think about what that scene would have  been. <br/>I think he would be mortified. I think the guy does have a soul. <br/>I know Richard Hatch. As jerky as he might seem, he is not someone who would purposely  go and sexually violate someone. <br/>Angry woman. <br/>She must have been feeling something awful for 24 hours to  have exploded like that. <br/>Uh. <br/>I felt terrible for her that she felt so violated and that  she felt so humiliated and insulted. Very mixed emotions. <br/>I thought it was brutal. I know it's a horrible thing that happened, but my God. That was hard for all of us to hear. I don't like her for it. I'm sorry. I know she went through a lot. Still, you got to learn how to contain your emotions. I was really offended that she'd bring us that far into her core  of hatred. I didn't like it. So... I don't know if that's mean-spirited, but that's how I  feel. <br/>You think she was influenced? You think Sue was influenced... to do what she did by leaving  the game? <br/>You know? I sat and talked with her for an hour up here, trying to  convince her that she could still... She could still pursue whatever she  wanted without throwing the game away. You know, now as it stands, we kind of gave them a hell of a  gift. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We didn't give them anything. <br/>Wedidn't. Suegave them a hell of a gift. With Richard getting voted off, Sue walking out, and losing the  challenge, three strikes-- Chapera was almost out for a few minutes. <br/>All right. <br/>Look, guys, there's no reason why, no matter what, we  should be able to win this, if you think about it, right? We're six strong, they're six strong. And then we can just roll, one right after another, after  another. <br/>If we stay strong together...  Then it comes down to us six. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Then whatever. <br/>I agree wholehearted. <br/>Let's all make a pact to stick together. <br/>You want to do that? <br/>Yes. <br/>This is it, guys. [ all talking]  I'm in it, no matter what. <br/>No matter what. <br/>Go, Chapera. <br/>One, two, three...  Chapera! <br/>We all promised each other we'd stick together no matter  what. What that really means, I don't know, but it's a good gesture,  and it's a good show of faith. <br/>Hmm! <br/>Get ready. <br/>Rupe, what's the look on the face? <br/>We got tree mail. <br/>All right. <br/>Oh, let's see. "A friend of yours has left the game. There will be no challenge played tonight."  Heads down. [ humming]  Let's have a moment of silence for Sue. <br/>For Sue. <br/>So, I need to...  Too bad we don't have any whiskey to show her how we  really feel. [ Rupert laughs]  Let's have some rice. <br/>Let's drink to her. <br/>Is it ready for lunch already? <br/>Let's have a drink. <br/>It means a lot to lose a member of our tribe, especially  the way that we had to lose Sue. But you can never count out Chapera for making a sad moment into  a happy moment. We're the happy tribe, and somehow, we always find a way to  laugh about it. <br/>I miss her so much. <br/>It was a sad day in Bedrock. <br/>It was... It was heart-wrenching. <br/>It's hard to get over. [ laughs]  I wasn't real happy with... I mean, I know Big Tom and Sue  didn't get along, but his insensitivity in doing the "Sue's Gone"  dance, I think is pretty crummy. We lost a valuable member of this tribe. She was like a guy. Sue is hard-core. And we can count on her every time we went to a challenge. And everybody knows that. I don't care if you like her or you don't like her. <br/>Ah, Sue...  Well, at least that's what we assumed. <br/>Right. <br/>It's somewhat of a relief. <br/>Sue is out of the game. We're going to be six to six. <br/>And at least we know that it's playing out the fair way we  wanted it to. <br/>That's right. <br/>Yes...  That's right. That's the most important. <br/>It definitely disappoints me that Sue couldn't keep it  together. I mean, I can't help but wish that she was still here. We were up a member. But Survivor'strue test is, if you're able to keep it together  and keep each other happy, then you're good to go. Yeah, we've had bad days, we have our lows, but we have so many  more highs. And that's what we concentrate on in this tribe. We don't even think about our lows for very long. We always think about the highs. <br/>All right, people, come forward. <br/>My girls. My girls know how to make rice. <br/>That's right. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>You can keep the oysters and the snails. This is what Survivoris all about. [ Rupert laughs] Rice, baby, rice.
