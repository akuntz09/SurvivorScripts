<br/>Â Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor...  <br/>I'm not going to fight with these kids. They hate  us.  <br/>Probst: When the fans' camp was filled with  disarray...  <br/>Everyone is tired. Everyone is hungry.  <br/>We need to fix our shelter.  <br/>Probst: ...Joel was vocal about getting the group back  together.  <br/>Why is everybody talking all the time and not  working?  <br/>Probst: At Malakal, two couples came together  strategically and romantically, creating a formidable alliance.  <br/>I think we'll be receiving birth announcements from Ando  and her little Ozzlets that she's about to have. And Parvati and James will  be at the wedding as soon as this is over.  <br/>Probst: Jonathan, Yau-Man, Eliza, and Ami created a second  alliance...  <br/>Hands in. I'll do it. I'll do it.  <br/>Probst: And both sides needed Cirie to gain a  majority.  <br/>I don't care. I'll get rid of anybody, as long as it's not  me.  <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, the favorites won  easily. Favorites win immunity! With the fans facing tribal council, Mikey B.  attempted to control the vote.  <br/>Let's get the final plan right now, and then we don't have  to talk about it again.  <br/>Probst: But after watching Mikey B. form a close bond with  Mary, Joel had other ideas.  <br/>Mikey thinks he's running this whole show. He and Mary  have to be broken up. Mary's going home. Mikey will be completely confused as  to what happened.  <br/>Probst: At tribal council, Joel's plan worked. Second  person voted out of Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites, Mary. And a stunned Mikey  B. watched his closest ally go home. 18 are left. 18 are left. Who will be  voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight?  <br/>Be careful right here, you guys-- right here.  <br/>I can only assume the big guy Joel stuck a knife in my  back already. Interesting. I don't blame the move, okay, you know, as long as  the move is not you to take that whole crew. That would be you with four  girls and a kid, you know?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>And Chet is included as a girl. Joel is playing a long  game right now when he should be focusing on a short game. When it gets down  to the merge, you get rid of the strong ones. When it's team versus team, you  keep your strength and you get rid of your weakness. And these people--  Tracy, Kathy, and Chet-- are weak around camp, and they're weak in the  challenges. They're all useless. I know it's a million bucks, but you're not  going to win with them. I mean, you're not doing it.  <br/>Mikey thinks he's got all the answers, and he guarantees  I'll never make it to the final four, and he just thinks he's got this whole  tribe in his pocket.  <br/>I consider it that you made a move that you didn't have to  make, okay, necessarily. And you know, if you want to make up for it, you  can.  <br/>And I would really, really like to see the look on his  face when the baseball bat comes swinging up beside him and wakes him up to  the reality that he doesn't have this tribe in his doesn't have this tribe in  his pocket. pocket.

I was, like,  hanging out with the old people. I'm only 24. I mean, not old, not old,  just...  <br/>They go to bed early.  <br/>Just tired of that damn cave.  <br/>Amanda, Ozzy, James, and Parvati said they were going to  go down to the beach, and they said, "Come with us. It will be  fun." So I went down there with them, So I went down there with them,  and they were working me. and they were working me. and they were working  me.  <br/>Right.  <br/>Right.  <br/>You dislike Jonathan that  <br/>You dislike Jonathan that much, huh? much, huh?  <br/>They were like, "You know, I think we need to keep  this team strong, and I think the two weakest people are Yau-Man and Cirie. I  think we need to get them out of here." And I kind of was like,  "Oh, yeah, sure, okay." I listened to them, but I don't trust them.  They'd be stupid to stick with us knowing that the five of us are so tight.  are so tight.  <br/>So what's the proposal?  <br/>So what's the proposal?  <br/>They've been working. They've been trying.  <br/>Unless they think that they have a chance with  Cirie.  <br/>Well, there's definitely a little bit of juggling the two  foursomes, because they need my vote, either side. And I'm still trying to  figure out which side is better for me.  <br/>If we get another vote, then Parvati's going to go,  right?  <br/>For sure.  <br/>She's weak enough and... and threatening enough because of  her relationships with Ozzy and with James.  <br/>And with Amanda. I mean, the two of them have been  bonding.  <br/>As long as the five of us stay strong, and we are, then  we're cool.  <br/>In this game, for me, it's all about who I think I can  trust. And if I feel that I can trust you, then I'm willing to go all the way  with you. But if I don't trust you, then you can't believe a word I tell you  can't believe a word I tell you. you.  <br/>Tree mail!  <br/>Tree mail!  <br/>Uh-oh!  <br/>This is a big tree mail, you guys.  <br/>Big tree mail.  <br/>Okay, it says, "Preparing to go into battle, use war  paint and a battle cry. Are you ready to tackle your enemy?" Oh!  "You better be ready to try. So pick three choices for your reward.  Today will be an aggressive meeting. If you win, you take them home. Lose,  and you just take a beating."  <br/>Okay.  <br/>It's our wrestling one that we've wanted for so  long.  <br/>This is our comfort catalogue.  <br/>Ah! Wow.  <br/>How many do we get to pick?  <br/>Three.  <br/>We get to pick three?  <br/>Oh, God!  <br/>We get three things, guys.  <br/>Right.  <br/>That's awesome.  <br/>All right!  <br/>Ready? Shelter-- tarp and rope.  <br/>Tarp and rope would be good.  <br/>Sleeping items-- blankets, pillows, mattress. We've got to  use our war paint, and we've got to come up with a battle cry.  <br/>Yes!  <br/>We're going to war.  <br/>Yeah. Yeah, it's war.  <br/>Y'all better get serious about this.  <br/>It should be like... just like a little, bitty  heart.  <br/>Are you ready to bring it?  <br/>Let's do it!  <br/>We are going to kick some ass today.  <br/>I know.  <br/>There's no way we're going to lose today. We're going to  decimate them. We have the will. We've been dry. We've been eating.  <br/>Ah!  <br/>There's no way we're losing this challenge.  <br/>We lost our last challenge. Morale is a little bit down.  But you can't fight emotionally. You have to fight logically. And logically,  if somebody comes and invades my home, I'm going to kill them.  <br/>Malakal! Malakal! Malakal! Malakal! Malakal!  Malakal!  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Favorites getting your first  look at the new tribe of fans. Mary voted out at the last tribal  council.  <br/>Mary?  <br/>Probst: This morning in tree mail, you were both given war  paint. Glad to see you put it to good use, because today is going to be a  battle. For today's challenge, both tribes will start at opposite ends of a  lagoon in their opponent's end zone. On my go, you will charge across the  lagoon toward the other tribe carrying three canvas bags. Your goal is to get  your three bags, plus two bags from the other tribe, into your end zone. You  are allowed to steal bags from your opponent's end zone even after they've  scored. First tribe to get five bags in their end zone at the same time wins  reward. This morning, in tree mail, you were also given a catalog, told to  choose three items. Here's what the favorites are playing for: shelter,  lighting kit, survival kit. Here's what the fans are playing for. They chose  differently: fishing kit, shelter, and a kitchen set. Winning tribe gets  their three items. Worth playing for?  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: Let's get it on.  <br/>Probst: Let's get it on. All right! Got a little bit of  rain to make it more fun. Here we go. For reward. Survivors ready? Go! Who's  going to square off against who? Joel knocks Yau-Man and takes Amanda down  hard. This is getting physical quick. James pulls Kathy off Cirie. Favorites  have two bags in their end zone, fans have one. Got to get five bags in at  once. Yau-Man on a breakaway. Yau-Man in to the end zone. Favorites have  three bags, fans have one. Joel and James going at it. James trying to take Joel  down. Joel tosses the bag. Big collision! Joel steals one from the favorites.  We're now back to favorites two, fans have one. Joel pulls Amanda down hard.  Been some hard hits already. Fans with two bags. Favorites with two bags.  We're tied up, two bags each. Jason has it. Hands it off to Alexis. Oh! A  huge collision with Penner. Heads knocked on that one. Penner pulling Alexis  back. That was the biggest collision so far. James just comes in and busts up  the whole pile. Erik steals a bag from the favorites. Erik is literally  pulling Eliza into the end zone. Fans have three bags, favorites with two.  You need five to win.  <br/>Get him!  <br/>Probst: Amanda going after Erik, who tosses Amanda over  his head. That irritates James. James now in on it. James grabbing Erik.  Mikey B. in on it. Alexis steals one from the favorites.  <br/>Come on! Run, run, run!  <br/>Probst: Alexis knocks Eliza down. We are 4-2. Fans need  one more bag. James trying to steal that bag. He's pulling three people in  the water. James has the bag for the favorites! We're tied 3-3. Amanda trying  to steal the bag from Mikey B. Amanda steals the bag for the favorites. Kathy  tries to tackle Amanda. Amanda tosses the bag to James. It is now 4-2.  Favorites now have four bags. They need just one more. Favorites have their  hands on that fifth and final bag. Penner fighting for it! Penner's got it!  This will do it! Favorites win reward! A huge battle comes to an end.  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>Probst: Nice work. Now you must choose one member from the  fans tribe to go to Exile Island. Who are you going to send to Exile?  <br/>We're going to send KB.  <br/>Probst: Kathy, you don't look pleased at all with that  news.  <br/>No.  <br/>Probst: Now who are you going to send from your own tribe?  Ami, you're excited to go to Exile?  <br/>I am-- second clue.  <br/>Probst: All right, Kathy and Ami head out. Boat's waiting  for you. You will rejoin your tribe at the next immunity challenge. All  right, fans, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp.  <br/>Good job, guys.  <br/>Good job, guys. Hell of a battle.  <br/>Probst: Favorites, congratulations. You have shelter, a  lighting kit, and a survival kit. Come get your stuff, head back Come get  your stuff, head back to camp. to camp.  <br/>The nice girl, we got tangled up, and she's like, "So  do you have a girlfriend?"  <br/>Well, Mike had both me and Amanda. He had two of us, like,  wrapped up, and we were both struggling to get free, and he's like, "I'd  like to stay like this all day."  <br/>Holy crap. That was like the hardest thing That was like  the hardest thing I've ever done. I've ever done.  <br/>I don't know if the other people feel relaxed because they  feel secure in their alliances, but I don't feel relaxed at all. I feel like  I have to continuously scramble to make sure everything works in my sure  everything works in my favor. favor.  <br/>You were just terminating, like, throwing people left and  right. I was very impressed.  <br/>Because I am in the middle right now, I have to look at  every option or every scenario that could possibly happen and try to have a  plan B. If I was in their position, I think they could do a little more for  me, actually. No one's washing my clothes. I haven't gotten any special  meals. I think if they really wanted my vote, they should probably do a  little more. I should probably be carried, I should probably be carried,  like, on a chariot-type thing. like, on a chariot-type thing. All right,  ladies, I'm just feeling a little bit nervous, and it's only because of the  relationships that you already have with James and you, Amanda, have with  Ozzy. But, Parvati, this James thing But, Parvati, this James thing just kind  of developed. just kind of developed.  <br/>Right.  <br/>Right.  <br/>That's the thing...  <br/>That's the thing...  <br/>I know.  <br/>I'm just going to put it out there. I like flirting with  Ozzy. So if that makes you uncomfortable, then I'll, like, stop, but...  <br/>No, no, no, no, don't change.  <br/>No, because that's the way you keep him close, you know?  And he doesn't asks questions. James asks me no questions.  <br/>Are you nervous about her?  <br/>No, I'm not.  <br/>She's like me a little. She gets paranoid. She needs to be  reassured a lot.  <br/>Let's reassure her.  <br/>Okay. But they're out there filling her head with  lies.  <br/>I want to vote Yau.  <br/>You want to vote Yau?  <br/>Because if Yau goes to Exile Island one time...  <br/>Oh, yeah.  <br/>Going up against Yau...  <br/>You'll never win.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>So I have both of you guys' word that it's us three to the  end.  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I don't care if James proposes to you or you and Ozzy have  little Ozzlets.  <br/>Oh, you know how I am.  <br/>All right.  <br/>So we'll talk to her. They're filling her head with stuff.  She's the swing vote, I guess. And why would she swing over to them unless  she thinks that she should be the queen bee over there?  <br/>Yeah, but she's not. She won't be.  <br/>Well, exactly.  <br/>I hope she doesn't fall for  <br/>I hope she doesn't fall for their garbage. their  garbage.  <br/>What's it say?  <br/>It says-- okay, listen good-- "Continue your quest by  crossing the ocean."  <br/>I'm here on Exile Island again. Right away, Ami wanted to  go to the other island. After having been to that island many times with  Cirie, I'm like... because Cirie and I found all four clues.  <br/>It says, "Cross the ocean." So that's what we've  done before.  <br/>Yeah. Ami saw the clue up in the tree, and she could not  figure it out, but I had to play dumb, you know, like, "I don't  know." I was just exhausted, and I wasn't about to go island wasn't  about to go island hopping again. hopping again.  <br/>I think we should, because the tide's coming in, not  out.  <br/>The waves started getting choppy. I said to Ami,  "Uh-oh." I'm no weatherman, but the clouds, everything, it looked  like a big storm was coming in. So pretty much clue searching So pretty much  clue searching had to come to an end. had to come to an end.  <br/>Oh, my God!  <br/>Oh, mother of God.  <br/>This is insane.  <br/>It's pouring down rain. Our shelter sucks. Everyone's  freezing. Everyone's cold. Everyone's sopping wet. Not much you can do.  <br/>Oh, wow, it sucks in here.  <br/>It sprinkled last night. Tonight it's a monsoon. Tonight  it's a monsoon. Oh, right on my face! Oh, right on my face!  <br/>Yay, victory!  <br/>Oh, yeah!  <br/>Came up to the cave and settled down for a nice sleep. The  rain is falling really, really, really, really hard, the hardest since we've  been here.  <br/>We're totally covered. Oh, my God, this is so great.  <br/>This is amazing.  <br/>Oh!  <br/>And I kind of feel bad for the whole Airai tribe. I know  that they are probably I know that they are probably not doing well right  now. not doing well right now.  <br/>I'm sure the other tribe is doing really well, staying dry  and probably laughing about us right now having to endure this wicked storm.  I just hope no spiders get me-- I just hope no spiders get me-- or scorpions  or rats. or scorpions or rats.  <br/>Last night was probably the worst night that we've had  since we've been here. It rained all night, and the shelter didn't do one  single bit of good.  <br/>Oh, God!  <br/>This morning, we feel like we got beat up twice  yesterday-- once by the other tribe and once once by the other tribe and once  by nature. by nature. by nature.  <br/>Glorious evening, huh?  <br/>Glorious evening, huh?  <br/>I didn't sleep at all. Did y'all?  <br/>No.  <br/>No.  <br/>My fingers are prune-y from it being so wet.  <br/>Oh, I know.  <br/>I bet the water is warmer. How did you sleep on the  boat?  <br/>Huh?  <br/>How did you sleep on the boat?  <br/>Oh, fine.  <br/>Not the sort of night you want to have before a challenge,  and this one's for immunity. I think that people are pretty demoralized right  now. demoralized right now. We cannot lose today. We cannot lose today. We  cannot lose today.  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Ami and  Kathy, returning from Exile Island. [ applause]  <br/>We had to just sleep in the rain.  <br/>Love you guys.  <br/>Probst: Ready to get to it?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: First things first. I know you're hiding that idol  back there, Amanda.  <br/>I know. I'm trying to keep it from you. We'll get it  back.  <br/>Probst: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For  today's challenge, each tribe will choose two men and two women. Their job  will be to hold to a very heavy rope net while members of the other tribe  attempt to shoot coconuts into the net. The more coconuts you get into the  other tribe's net, the heavier that net will become. The tribe that holds on  the longest wins immunity, guaranteed at least one more night in this game.  Losers go to tribal council. Somebody will be voted out. Give you a minute to  strategize. Give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. We'll get  started. Here we go. Holding the net for the fans: Erik, Natalie, Tracy, and  Joel. For the favorites: Parvati, James, Jonathan Penner, and Cirie.  Survivors ready? Go.  <br/>Come on, Ozzy.  <br/>Probst: Ozzy and Mikey B. up first. Learning curve. You  want to get as many coconuts in the other tribe's net as you can. Jason  connects for the fans.  <br/>Good job.  <br/>Probst: The more coconuts, the heavier that net will  become.  <br/>God, that's heavy.  <br/>Probst: A little harder to throw a coconut than you'd  think. Alexis connects for the fans. Eliza just misses.  <br/>Come on, Amanda!  <br/>You almost got it!  <br/>That wasn't correct, Amanda.  <br/>Probst: Jason showing them how it's done. Yau-Man finally  breaks the spell. Favorites are on the board. Kathy just misses for the fans.  Ami gets one in. Now the favorites are on a roll. Alexis drills another  one.  <br/>Yeah, you're good, little one.  <br/>Probst: Eliza goes underhand.  <br/>Yeah, Eliza!  <br/>Probst: Chet! Nobody missing.  <br/>Sweet lord, Chet! Yes, Ozzy! Yes! Come on, Kathy, show us  how it's done in Wisconsin. Chet, we're at a pageant and... Chet!  <br/>Probst: Penner talking a lot of trash-- just what we  expect.  <br/>Nice shot there, squirrely boy.  <br/>Probst: Reminds me of the  <br/>Probst: Reminds me of the Cook Islands. Cook Islands. Nets  starting to get heavier now. How's it going, James?  <br/>I'm chillin'.  <br/>Probst: Yeah.  <br/>Always.  <br/>Probst: Fans having to readjust a little bit.  <br/>Come on, guys. Let's speed it up.  <br/>Come on, Oz. Nice.  <br/>Probst: Ozzy puts another one in. Jason banks another one  for the fans. Amanda connects. Kathy connects.  <br/>Nice shot, Kathy.  <br/>Probst: Everybody putting coconuts in the net. Weight  starting to get heavy now. Starting to show. Starting to take its toll  now.  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: Parvati, James, Penner, and Cirie now starting to  struggle a bit.  <br/>Sink it, Mike!  <br/>Probst: Fans starting to put some weight in that favorites  net. Erik, Natalie, Tracy, Joel struggle a bit.  <br/>Come on, guys. You got to sink those.  <br/>Probst: Parvati, James, Penner, Cirie struggling. Mikey B.  adds more weight.  <br/>Just a couple more, guys-- couple more!  <br/>Probst: James trying to hold on. Parvati trying to hold  on. Chet puts another one in for the fans.  <br/>Hold it!  <br/>Probst: That's it! Fans win immunity! [ fans  cheering]  <br/>That's what I'm talking about.  <br/>We won!  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>Probst: Fans, congratulations. [ cheering and  applause]  <br/>All right!  <br/>Probst: Immunity, nobody going home, nobody going to  tribal council. Favorites, you know the drill. Tribal council, one of you  will be voted out. Grab your stuff, head back to Grab your stuff, head back  to camp. camp.  <br/>Today we lost the immunity challenge, which sucks. It was  hard enough just coming back from Exile Island after the night that I had,  but then coming back, losing a challenge, and having to go to tribal council  tonight-- I mean, does council tonight-- I mean, does it get worse on  Survivor? it get worse on Survivor?  <br/>She's sleeping with James, and we can't have it. You know,  we just can't have that. I'm sorry. It's a dumb play on her part. Do you  agree?  <br/>All right.  <br/>And we're cool, right, you and me?  <br/>We're cool.  <br/>I think we should just stick with the plan.  <br/>Okay, stick with the plan,  <br/>Okay, stick with the plan, stick with the plan. stick with  the plan.  <br/>Cirie wants Yau-Man gone, so... we need her. so... we need  her.  <br/>Yeah, but that's her play.  <br/>Yeah, but that's her play.  <br/>And he's going to go to Exile before the next immunity  challenge. There's just a strong possibility it's going to happen.  <br/>Yeah, but still...  <br/>And I know they want to vote me out.  <br/>Yeah, they're after your ass, baby. baby.  <br/>Better not!  <br/>Better not!  <br/>I just... I feel like Eliza would be a better choice.  Yau-Man's stronger.  <br/>Eliza, we can get rid of Eliza any day.  <br/>I know, but if we keep YauMan, the chances of having a good  run at an immunity challenge are better. Eliza is not good at  challenges.  <br/>He's out for himself.  <br/>I swear, we can vote Eliza next.  <br/>And he'll sneak by.  <br/>We can, anybody you want, but I cannot stay here and see  him find another idol and not be able to go, and I thought we were all cool  on that.  <br/>What do you think?  <br/>Yeah, I mean, if you guys really feel that way.  <br/>I feel.  <br/>Which one?  <br/>Yau.  <br/>Or Jonathan, either one.  <br/>What's going on, dudes?  <br/>What's up, man?  <br/>I didn't mean to break up the party.  <br/>Oh, you didn't.  <br/>You all right?  <br/>Okay, we're going to do some  <br/>Okay, we're going to do some girl stuff. girl stuff.  <br/>Me or Yau? So who's she voting for, me or Yau?  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>Just tell me, is it me or is it Yau?  <br/>I don't know. They're trying to decide. That's what they  were talking about when you walked up.  <br/>I'm starting to feel a little antsy about the vote, only  because I'd like to believe that Cirie is tight with us, but obviously Amanda  and Parvati have been pouring a lot of BS into her ear, and you know, you  have to hope that Cirie is, I don't know, smart enough, loyal enough, happy  enough to stick with our group. It's going to be the five of us to vote off  Parvati because she's got these two guys wrapped around her finger. It's that  simple. Now, I don't know what they've said to you about our trustworthiness  or our desire to vote you out. I don't know what they've said, okay?  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>It's not true. Please, because we've been a solid five.  The plan is a good one. It's simply not true.  <br/>Those two pairs together-- right?-- forms a core  four.  <br/>You know, I hear that.  <br/>There's no way you could work yourself into it. I mean, as  soon as they've got the vote, they're going to take you out.  <br/>But you know what, Yau? The same argument that you're  using, they use the same argument. So why should I believe this one over that  one?  <br/>I'm not going to use an argument. I'm going to use common  sense.  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>Honestly, the five of us should march forward together.  There's no reason not to. We have... I have no hidden agenda. I have no  interest in voting any of the four of you out. That's the god's honest  truth.  <br/>I know that you and Yau have y'all little thing, and if  you want to stand here and say that y'all don't...  <br/>But there's only the two of us.  <br/>Cirie, Cirie...  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Hold on, hold on, hold on.  <br/>That's my thing. That's my thing.  <br/>I appreciate that. I appreciate that.  <br/>Keep it real.  <br/>Let's keep it real.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I think that you and I have a little thing, okay? I think  that Ami and I have a little thing. It's ridiculous!  <br/>Call it what you want.  <br/>I'm going to. I'm going to.  <br/>And being like that is not really going to get my vote,  seriously.  <br/>Listen, wait a second. We have a long way to go. It's  day...  <br/>I know. I played. Just like you played, I played too. How  far did you go?  <br/>I don't know, maybe not as far as you.  <br/>I've seen everybody. I may look like I'm laughing and  joking and playing, but I'm watching everybody, and I know that what you  have... I know there's no way you would vote him out before me. I know it  ain't.  <br/>I don't... you know what? I thought we were solid. And  they've come up, and they've said stuff to you that has put doubt into your  mind. But I have not done anything to you to put that doubt into your  mind.  <br/>I just...  <br/>I'm trying... you know, you want to keep it real. I'm  trying to keep it real.  <br/>I have, I have. This is why we're having this  conversation.  <br/>Well, I am keeping it real.  <br/>Well, I am keeping it real. We're having a conversation.  We're having a conversation.  <br/>I'm going to change, and I'm going to think, and I just  need, like, five minutes without all the stuff. [ Cirie sighing]  <br/>I mean, let's take Yau-Man out tonight if that's the way  it's got to be, but Parvati...  <br/>I don't think that's a good idea.  <br/>I don't think so either. So who's it going to be?  <br/>I think Eliza is the obvious choice.  <br/>All right.  <br/>If you guys were to vote for Parvati, it's going to be  throwing votes away, and it will be Yau-Man who goes home, because they will  have numbers.  <br/>You know, I hear what you're saying about your  relationship with her, you know, but I'm talking about the fact that she's  got you in her corner, and she's got James, and it's dangerous. You know,  Eliza's not a threat. I mean, you're right, she's the weakest link, but she's  also the least threatening link. You know what I mean? I mean, that's just  the way I've been think about it, but I can rethink it, I guess.  <br/>Cirie is not going to change her vote. She's voting for  Yau.  <br/>That's fine.  <br/>We have to vote with her.  <br/>I'm not... I'm voting for Eliza. I have to. I think that's  the right thing to do. I think that to keep us strong is to vote out  Eliza.  <br/>But Cirie's not budging on Yau. She's voting Yau-Man. If  we don't...  <br/>We don't need Cirie.  <br/>If we don't vote with her...  <br/>Then what?  <br/>...she's not going to... she'll never trust us.  <br/>Who's she going to trust, someone other than the five of  us?  <br/>I just don't think it's a good thing if we vote different  people. I just think we all need to vote the same person.  <br/>I don't think it's good, too, that she's, like, setting  this decision. Like, what's up with that?  <br/>I don't think that's right.  <br/>Next time it's going to be all her decision, too?  <br/>No.  <br/>You see what I'm saying, though? Like, I didn't like  that.  <br/>I agree. Let's talk to her right now.  <br/>Who?  <br/>Cirie.  <br/>What?  <br/>All five of us need to talk.  <br/>The more that I think about it, the more it seems like it  makes more sense to vote Eliza.  <br/>Eliza, please? Please, please.  <br/>Come on, Cirie.  <br/>Why is it so...  <br/>Because we need the strength right now.  <br/>For challenges.  <br/>We're going to be on man short.  <br/>It doesn't matter, but we all need to be on the same page  as far as the five of us.  <br/>I really... honestly, I don't want to change my vote. I  don't feel threatened by Eliza at all.  <br/>That's not sticking together, though.  <br/>My vote has never changed. Your votes changed.  <br/>Cirie is killing me. You can't be the boss of everything,  and everybody just let her go, let her go, and let her go. She went from the  swing vote to the one who's deciding what's going on for the whole group.  That can't happen. This feels like I'm in China again, messing with a bunch  of dumbasses.  <br/>I'm not sure we can't still get Parvati out with four. I'm  not sure. Because they're split between...  <br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  <br/>Some folks want to vote for Yau, and some folks want to  vote for you. Four votes for her may be enough.  <br/>They're not going to go into tribal split. That's the  dumbest thing ever. They're not that stupid.  <br/>They were kind of talking like they might.  <br/>Craziness, craziness before the vote. Well, the four of  us, the remaining four of the five, not including Cirie, are going to stay  tight and vote for Parvati.  <br/>What's going on?  <br/>Because right now, the other group, including Cirie, are  split. Some of them want to vote Eliza out as the weakest link. Some of them  want to vote YauMan out as either the weakest link or the biggest threat. I'm  not sure why they would vote Yau-Man out. Come on, go be productive. You're  being paranoid. If we can keep them split, if we can keep them from coming to  a consensus, our four votes would actually be enough to get Parvati out. Our  four votes may actually win the day. That's what I'm hoping for, That's what  I'm hoping for, fingers crossed. fingers crossed.  <br/>Probst: Penner, got to ask, how disappointing is it to be  back here?  <br/>It's terrible. After that big victory yesterday that felt  so great and so earned, today was a tough day after that loss.  <br/>Probst: James, do the fans earn a bit of respect from you guys  that they are here to play as well?  <br/>Yeah, they have definitely earned some respect. They got a  little more hunger in them. We're dry, and we have food, and I guess it's  made us kind of soft. We do need to win and make sure that the favorites are  on the top at the end, and they're winning right now, and I don't like  it.  <br/>Probst: Yau-Man, have you isolated a problem why you're  losing?  <br/>We need to really, really be hungry for the win. Whenever  we won anything, we were all very happy for, you know, a day, and then once  we lost, happened to be the more critical ones, and I feel very vulnerable  every time we lose.  <br/>Probst: Penner, there's two ideas going on early in the  game. Is this more about "Let's all try to stay together," or is it  "I'm going to win this game, one way or another"?  <br/>I think some of us would like to stay together and make  this tribe as strong as possible. And I think that some of us are making  moves already to eliminate people that they consider threats to them and take  control of the game.  <br/>Probst: Cirie, where are you sitting on this?  <br/>For me, Jeff, I'm looking at it as far as the tribe and as  far as myself in this game. And if I'm not playing the game that's going to  benefit you the most, it doesn't mean that I'm not doing what's best for the  tribe.  <br/>Probst: Penner, you had a lot of reactions during that  comment.  <br/>I mean, she's made a move today that will advance her in  the game and put her in a power position, and I don't think anybody believes  that voting out the person that she wants to vote out is going to make the  tribe stronger.  <br/>For me, Jeff, had I made the move that he wanted me to  make, we wouldn't even be having this conversation.  <br/>I thought you were in an alliance, and you flopped, and  then you brought everybody over. You did.  <br/>Is this not the pot calling the kettle black?  Whatever.  <br/>I don't know. I thought I was in an alliance with you.  Until today, I was.  <br/>Jonathan, I came into your alliance as the fifth person,  and I'm supposed to trust you.  <br/>Were you in the alliance? Were you in the alliance? Did  you say you were in the alliance and working with us and that we were solid  and all that? You did.  <br/>I did, I did.  <br/>Okay, that's all I want to say.  <br/>I did, but I don't trust you, point blank, period.  <br/>And now you've asked everyone else to help you vote off  the person that is a threat...  <br/>I didn't ask anybody anything.  <br/>Please.  <br/>We all came to a decision to vote who we vote... who we're  voting.  <br/>Because you said you weren't going to vote for anybody  else. That's the only person you were going to vote for.  <br/>You told me the best thing for this tribe was to get rid  of Parvati.  <br/>I still believe that.  <br/>And because I didn't do that, this is why we're having  that conversation.  <br/>I'm only trying to make moves to make this tribe  stronger.  <br/>I'm not doing what you want me to do. I don't trust you as  far as I can pick you up and throw you. Sorry. And if you're upset that they  trust me, too bad.  <br/>I'm not upset. I'm upset that you are going to now be in  the driver's seat.  <br/>Because I'm not voting the way you want me to vote.  <br/>Anybody can vote any way they want.  <br/>They should. I don't have mind control over anybody here.  So y'all all vote however you want to vote.  <br/>Right, I would urge everyone to vote their conscience.  Then we have some common ground that we can work from. Otherwise, it's going  to be, I think, a much bigger split and kind of disastrous. So I'm hoping  that people do vote the way they honestly believe this tribe is going to be  the strongest.  <br/>Everybody here knows it was split.  <br/>Right.  <br/>Probst: Parvati, during this whole thing, you had a look  on your face like "I just wish this would go away."  <br/>Yeah. I mean, people are concerned that maybe I'm just  flirting and manipulating other people to, you know, make alliances and get  people on my side. So yeah, I know that my name has been brought up. And that  scares me, but that doesn't surprise me at all.  <br/>Probst: Well, it sounds like however it goes down, it's  going to be a very big vote for this tribe. Let's get to it. It is time to  vote. It is time to vote. Amanda, you're up. Amanda, you're up.  <br/>I have nothing against you, Parvati, but I think that by  following Cirie, you have signed your own death warrant. She's led you like a  sheep to the slaughter and played you like a fiddle. like a fiddle. I'm sorry  for you. I'm sorry for you.  <br/>You aligning with the biggest liar in the game made me  feel like strategically this was the best move for me. Sorry.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has the  hidden immunity idol, now is the time to play it. Once votes are read, the  decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote,  Parvati. First vote, Parvati. First vote, Parvati. Yau-Man.

That's  enough. You need to bring me your torch.  <br/>Great playing with you. Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't  cry. Don't cry.  <br/>Probst: Yau-Man, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to  go.  <br/>Good luck, you guys.  <br/>Good luck, you guys. Have fun. Have fun.  <br/>Probst: Well, the problem with this tribe is no secret.  You guys are divided. Big question is what are you going to do about it? Grab  your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night.
