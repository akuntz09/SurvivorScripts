<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: With his back against the wall, Kenny,  along with his trusted ally, Crystal, engineered three blindsides in a row. Charlie, the tribe has spoken. ...to create the most powerful alliance in the game. <br/>I'm like a little rat. I go... You mess with me, then you're gone in this game. <br/>Probst: His smartest play was when he convinced Susie to switch alliances and  join him. <br/>It's going down, Kenny. I knew you were my boy. <br/>Probst: The only potential roadblocks on his path to the finals are the two  hidden immunity idols: a real one...  Mm. Okay. <br/>Probst: ...owned by Sugar...  I found it. <br/>Probst: ...and an amazing-looking counterfeit created by Bob. <br/>This is my new fake idol. <br/>Probst: If either idol comes into play, the game changes, and Kenny's plans  could go up in smoke. <br/>It's sort of like when you're holding up a bank. You don't necessarily need the gun. If they think you got a gun, they might leave you alone. <br/>Probst: Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Let's get it going, man. <br/>That's right. <br/>Nobag back in the hizzy. (laughter)  Nobag. <br/>Kenny and Crystal know exactly what's going on in camp. They know the power is shifting. <br/>That was an intense session. Dude, that was the biggest war zone yet. <br/>Yeah. (laughter)  Everybody better be pretty happy right here. <br/>I thought I was the target tonight because I was pissing a whole bunch of  people off. That wasn't the case. They made more of a smart vote. Charlie's got a lot of friends. I don't. <br/>'Cause he's the big threat. <br/>He's a good sport. <br/>Yes, he is. <br/>He's awesome. He went out with class. <br/>And we're in Gabon for another full moon. <br/>I'm gonna do whatever I think I can do. When I wake up tomorrow morning, I'm going to reevaluate the situation and  hope to come out with something. I mean, Kenny and Crystal are taking out my entire alliance. My chances are very slim. You know, most likely, me, Bob and Randy-- we're going to go home, and we  don't know in what order, but we're going to go home. <br/>It's crazy. <br/>Yeah, they just...  Like the beginning of the game again. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION (theme song playing)  *  Oh, yeah. (indistinct chatter)  I know. <br/>But if you have it... You don't? <br/>No. <br/>Everybody besides Corinne, Randy, and Bob know that I have the idol. Bob still thinks the idol's out there. I kind of feel bad about it, but it is hilarious. <br/>Okay. <br/>You did? <br/>That does look very good. You are very creative. How did you make that, Bob? <br/>I stole some of those beads. I took that resin and put it down there. <br/>Oh, my God, they're awesome. <br/>Looks good. <br/>That's really good. <br/>Fooled you. <br/>So...  You know, this game is getting crazy. Bob has made himself a fake idol, and he made it out of resin and beads. And it's got a little happy face on it. I guess Bob might have some kind of strategy in showing me the fake immunity  idol. Maybe he's an evil genius. I don't know. Just try and... try and relax. <br/>You really think it's Susie, Crystal, and, uh...? <br/>Kenny, yes. <br/>And-And Kenny in the final three? <br/>Yes, I do. But I think they've probably sold that story to Sugar and Matty, and they're  so stupid, they buy it. I mean, don't they realize there's five of them? They can't all be final three. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Hello! <br/>There's a whole lot of game left, though, you know? Corinne is still an ally, but what can you do with two people? We've got immunity idols. We got huge physical threats like Matty. Uh, I continue... I'm planning on just continuing to be my same charming self. I don't like any of these people. <br/>I hate them! <br/>And I hate them. And if I pretended to be nice and like them, like Matty's doing, I'm not very  good at that. It would show through, and I said, the only...  You're less damaging to yourself by just shutting it down. <br/>Yeah. Well-Well, shutting it down, as well as continue to being nice. <br/>Don't even bother trying to be nice to Sugar, you know. Just keep away from them and work on Matty, and just see if you can get him  to understand he's going to be on the chopping block. <br/>The hand I have to...  Give him the final three with us. <br/>Desperate times call for desperate measures. We've got to get somebody to flip-flop now and come with us, and that  somebody has got to be Matty because the credibility of all the others is  crap. <br/>You guys! Tree mail has individual envelopes for everybody! (gasps and cheers)  "Going, going, gone. He who hesitates is lost. Nourishment and power. Everything has its cost."  Auction, sounds like. <br/>Auction. <br/>500. <br/>I'm not going to spend a dime in the auction unless I get something that is  going to help me stay in this game. I mean, that is worth every penny of $500. Nothing tastes better than $500, except a million. (bird squeaking)  Probst: Welcome to the Survivor auction. You each have 500 U.S. dollars. Bidding will be in increments of $20. You cannot pool money. You cannot share food. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Ready for your first item? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Beer. <br/>Uh-oh! (laughter)  Probst: And peanuts. Start the bidding. <br/>$20. <br/>Probst: $20 to Randy. <br/>$40. <br/>Probst: $40 to Sugar. <br/>$60. <br/>$80. <br/>Probst: $80 to Sugar. <br/>$100. <br/>$160. <br/>Probst: Sugar jumps right to $160. <br/>$180. <br/>Probst: Beer looking good? $180 to Randy. Going once, going twice. Sold to Randy. Three cold bears and peanuts. <br/>I don't love beer that much. I just wanted to up the ante for him. <br/>Probst: Enjoy. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Next item. It will remain covered. <br/>$100. <br/>Probst: $100 to Kenny. <br/>Two even. <br/>Probst: $200 to Randy. <br/>$300. <br/>Probst: $300 to Kenny. <br/>Ooh! <br/>$320. <br/>Probst: $320 to Randy. <br/>I think that's all he has. <br/>$340. <br/>Probst: $340 to Kenny. Going once, twice. Sold to Kenny for $340. <br/>Here you go, Jeff. <br/>Kenny deserves something sweet. <br/>Awesome. <br/>Probst: This is what you just bought. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Open it up and read it right here. Read it out loud. <br/>"Send yourself or someone else to Exile Island. If you send someone else, you take all of their money."  Oh. <br/>Probst: You have a choice. You can send yourself...  I need a lot of money. <br/>Probst: ...or someone else. <br/>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding! <br/>I'll take Bob. <br/>Probst: All right, Kenny, go get Bob's money. <br/>I'm sorry, Bob. When I had the choice to send anybody to Exile Island, I'm, like, "Okay,  Bob, give me your money. I'm sorry, but you can go to Exile Island." He doesn't know the idol's  not there 'cause Sugar has it. And Bob couldn't find it last time, so he-he wants to give it another shot to  find it. <br/>Probst: Here is a map to Exile Island. You will return in time for the next immunity challenge. <br/>Works for me. <br/>Probst: Straight out. <br/>All right. Thanks. (laughter)  Probst: Next item up for bid. <br/>$100. <br/>$120. <br/>Probst: $120 to Matty. <br/>$200. <br/>Probst: $200 to Randy. <br/>$300. <br/>$320. <br/>Probst: $320 to Randy. <br/>That's all his money? <br/>I think so. <br/>I think so. <br/>He can have it, then. <br/>$340. <br/>Probst: $340 to Sugar. <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Probst: $340 to Sugar. Going once, going twice. Sold. Come on up. <br/>Hmm. (laughter)  Probst: $340. All right, Sugar, this is what you bought. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>What is it? <br/>Chocolate and peanut butter. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Just what she wanted. <br/>Chocolate and peanut butter. Thank you very much. <br/>God. <br/>Aah! <br/>Chocolate...  Probst: Next item. A hot bath. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Everything you need to get clean. <br/>Hmm. <br/>Probst: And a clean set of your clothes. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Kenny. <br/>$320. <br/>Probst: Randy doesn't hesitate. $320. <br/>And get some new clothes. <br/>$340. <br/>Probst: $340 to Susie. <br/>I bid $100 to bathe her if she wins. <br/>Ew. <br/>Yeah, that's not gonna happen. <br/>Probst: $340 to Susie. Going once, going twice. Sold to Susie. <br/>You can count it. <br/>Probst: Okay. <br/>You should have gone for that, Kenny. (laughter)  Would you cuddle with a rich man? (laughter)  Oh! <br/>Ooh, yay! <br/>Ooh! Yes! (laughter)  Probst: Ready for your next item? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: I think everybody here is going to bid on this item. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Burger and fries? <br/>$100. <br/>$120. <br/>$140. <br/>$320. <br/>Probst: $320 to Randy. <br/>$340. <br/>Probst: $340 to Kenny. <br/>$400. <br/>Probst: $400 to Matty. <br/>You can have it. <br/>Probst: $400. <br/>$400 to Matty. <br/>Probst: Once, twice. Sold to Matty. Kenny had a lot more money, passed it up. $400 for a cheeseburger, fries, the fixings, and a soda. <br/>Oh, and it's on a ciabatta bun. <br/>Oh, man. Nice. (laughter)  I think I'm actually going to get out, guys. It's really hot. <br/>No, don't get out! What the hell are you doing, woman?! This is the first bath you've had in 28 days. <br/>Probst: You done in your bath? <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: All right. <br/>That's cuckoo. I would have been there the whole time. <br/>Probst: Next item will remain covered. <br/>Let's try $100. <br/>Probst: 100 to Kenny. <br/>Two even. <br/>Probst: 200 to randy. <br/>Keep going. <br/>220. <br/>240. <br/>260. <br/>280. <br/>He can have it. <br/>Probst: Kenny, giving it up again. <br/>Yeah, he can have it. I know it's going to be something bad. <br/>Ooh, Kenny. Probst: Sold to Randy, $280. <br/>What is that? <br/>Ooh, good job, Randy! <br/>Probst: Spaghetti, garlic bread, and a glass of wine. <br/>Sorry, man. Next item, inside this sealed bottle is a note. This note gives you a huge advantage in the next immunity challenge. <br/>All 500. <br/>Probst: Suddenly, Corinne is interested. That makes Kenny the only one with enough money to outbid her. <br/>Probst: Going once... Going twice...  Yeah? <br/>Probst: Kenny gives it up again. Sold to Corinne for $500. <br/>I hope it was worth it. <br/>Probst: Here's how this works. Take this bottle. It needs to remain sealed until I see you at the next immunity challenge. <br/>Okay, thanks. <br/>Probst: Next item: first 20 bucks buys this for the tribe. <br/>20. <br/>Probst: Sold to Randy. <br/>He was quick! <br/>Thank you, Randy. <br/>Probst: You bought this for the tribe. <br/>How sweet, Randy. <br/>Probst: You just made a lot of people very happy. <br/>Oh, my God! (cheering)  Thank you, Randy! <br/>I can have them all to myself if I want? <br/>Probst: For the tribe, Randy. <br/>Okay. Who wants one? Would you like one? <br/>I don't want one, thank you. <br/>Are you sure? <br/>I couldn't possibly. <br/>Would you like one? <br/>Sure. <br/>Randy, this is so awesome. <br/>Are you sure, Sugar? <br/>Matty is getting it. <br/>It's not yours to give to Matty. I'm the boss. You can have two, if you'd like. <br/>Oh, I'll take one and a half. Can I do that? <br/>Sure. <br/>Probst: So, Randy, you're giving part of Sugar's to Corinne? <br/>Uh, Sugar doesn't have one. I offered her one, and she didn't take one, so, they're mine. <br/>Thank you. You want half? <br/>Yes, please. <br/>Go for it. <br/>Thank you. Last chance, you can have a full one. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Randy offers Sugar his own cookie. She takes it and gives it to Matty. <br/>Yeah, would you like to repeat that? <br/>Probst: Wow. I think it worked out the way it worked out. <br/>Randy, you at least have to take this. <br/>This is better for me. <br/>You sure? <br/>Probst: Well, I'd suggest you start eating those quickly 'cause the Survivor  auction is over. <br/>Sugar-- she can kiss my ass. If she thinks I was bad before, I'm just going to turn it up a notch. There's a lot of fight left in this dog. <br/>Probst: Have a good night. <br/>Welcome home, Nobag. (laughter)  Check it out. <br/>Corinne, I have to say, good things come to those who wait. <br/>That's right. <br/>I thought you were blowing it, but you made the good decision. And, Sugar, I have to say, that was the most righteous gift I've ever been  given. <br/>What gift, Matty? You got to be kidding me. That wasn't a gift from her, man. Weren't you watching? <br/>Thought she handed it to me. <br/>Yeah, but that was my cookie. I didn't get one. <br/>Oh. <br/>You had two, I had none. <br/>Sorry. <br/>But not your fault. I left the auction broke, full, half drunk, and pissed off. I got a little room left for one big cookie. So I'm going to burn this house down in the next day or so. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Over a cookie. Over a cookie. How funny is that? Oh, my gosh. Have you ever seen a grown man get so mad over a chocolate chip cookie? And the only reason I took his damn cookie is because he didn't want to give  me a cookie. He wanted to give everybody a cookie but Sugar because Sugar's evil. <br/>How you feeling, big buddy? Still bitter? <br/>Ah, there's no one to talk to. Nobody listens to me. <br/>What about me? <br/>You're busy talking to everybody else, man. What we witnessed today at the auction-- I mean, I was treated like a dog. <br/>You've set yourself up, Randy. We've got to drop the attitude and just be cool. <br/>I'm not going to try to talk to them, any of them. <br/>You know, obviously, we're in a desperate position. We're three people. You guys were five. So, you know that if you, you know, if you have any kind of idea, if you'd  like to work with us in any way, we're certainly open to it. <br/>You're on the outs. The final three in this game is Kenny, Susie, and Crystal. Matty's got two ways to play. He can stay with the original Fang and go to the finals that way, or he can  come with me and Corinne and Bob and have a shot at winning. <br/>It's nothing to be ashamed of. <br/>I just arrived at Exile. I'm going to go for the clue for the immunity idol, and that's a real clear  choice for me. The next couple Tribals, there's a very tight group that are going to vote  Corinne, Randy, and myself off. "Across the lake you see so well, there lies a sandy crater. The object hidden in its floor will surely help you later." Oh, damn. I realized the extra clue I got this time was a clue that I'd already found  on my own last time. I was a little depressed, but I got a lot of time here, and what I'm going to  do is, I'm going to go for my own little safari. I just think that will be more rewarding for me than aimlessly looking around  for an idol. * When I came to Africa, I came here to experience not only Survivor, but to  sort of learn about myself, to really think about how lucky a person I am,  what a wonderful family I have. It takes your breath away. And what a beautiful place Africa is. I see why they call it the Garden of Eden. <br/>Trying? Trying? <br/>Are you even gonna try? <br/>Okay, I'm coming. I'm going to sit down and express. <br/>Express? (overlapping chatter)  Okay, you guys, we're getting down to a point where it's pretty dicey for us. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay, so, we-we got to keep the five of us strong, right? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Randy. Obviously, it's a no-brainer. He's set himself up. He's made his own coffin. <br/>Yes...  But...  But? <br/>Bob should go next just to get him out of the loop, so he doesn't win  immunities and end our five-some up. Randy's not going to win any challenges. Corinne's not going to win any challenges. Bringing them in to the final final six, final seven is way safer for us. I think Bob should go next. <br/>I'm noticing now that Matty is really playing the game and that he is trying  to take control, and that he is a physical threat, and he's trying to get rid  of Bob, who is the other physical threat, and hang on to Randy for some  reason. Is he going to join up with Randy 'cause he's wizening up and know that it's  smart to have a jerk at the end? <br/>We got to have a plan, so it it has to be Bob. <br/>Okay. <br/>It has to be Randy, then Corinne. Bob, Randy, Corinne. <br/>Okay. <br/>That's the order. <br/>Then we're down to the four. <br/>It sucks. <br/>I know it sucks, but stop...  Hello! <br/>Okay, fine. <br/>Here he is. Here-Here he comes. Here he comes. Bob, Randy, Corinne. Bob, Randy, Corinne. <br/>I know. <br/>Good morning, sunshine. <br/>What you got for me? <br/>FYI, I'm crashing and burning today. <br/>I love this. <br/>I stayed up all night just thinking of the most diabolical thing that we  could do to keep us in the game and get the worst person in this game out. Corinne, myself, and Bob are on the outside. Our only chance is to shake things up. I'm going to be crashing and burning all day, make everybody miserable,  showing these morons... Just putting them in their place. The plan is for me to act really nasty, continue to mix it up with everybody,  and the old Fang people are going to vote for me. Our only prayer is if Bob would give me the idol. <br/>This is a good idea. <br/>Everyone vote me out. I spring the idol out at Tribal. Susie is three votes, and goes home. <br/>I love it. <br/>It's our only prayer. <br/>That's a great plan. <br/>We get the feeling that Bob probably found the immunity idol, and the plan is  to convince Bob to give me the hidden immunity idol. I play the idol. VoilÃ -- Susie, joke's on you. You're going home. <br/>So, think about it, enjoy the thought. Yeah. <br/>I don't need to think about it. I'm-I'm totally on board. I'm going to talk to Bob...  I mean, it buys us three more days, and something new could happen. <br/>I will talk to Bob. Let me see if I can get Bob on board. <br/>You like it? <br/>I love it. <br/>I not only want Susie to go home, but I want to blindside her. The reason that myself and Corinne and Bob are in the predicament we are in  is because Susie flipped. She went with Crystal and Kenny, and they voted Marcus out. That's part of the game, but the hell with her. Uh, this would be sweet, sweet revenge. (Randy imitates yawning)  Why do you have to tell the world? <br/>There's not a... There's not a normal person among them, except you, and you  even... even whored yourself out. <br/>Oh, my God. Don't do this, dude. Don't. <br/>You know you have. You know, I don't blame you. It's worth a million dollars to you. It's not to me. <br/>Oh, my God. Randy just sealed his fate, you know. I've done what I can. And if you're not going to listen to what I have to say or take my advice,  then, I mean, there's nothing I can do. It's a no-brainer that Randy has to go home now, and he's going out with a  bang. <br/>Guess how many of those cookies I ate? <br/>Those freaking cookies. <br/>I was in charge of every single one of them, but I didn't get any. It-it was for the tribe, and I could do anything-- I could put it in the dirt  and stomp on it, if I wanted to. <br/>I got the impression that you really didn't want to give it...  To anybody. <br/>I'm tired of this story. <br/>Thank you. <br/>You're right. I'm done. <br/>Then shut the (bleep) up. <br/>I can talk when I want. <br/>Randy got to go. Randy needs to go. He is a troll. He is wreaking havoc in the Nobag tribe. <br/>That man. <br/>He's going home. <br/>Oh, yeah, doesn't matter. <br/>I like where I'm sitting right now. They're all freaking out. And that's a real good thing. The more they freak out, the more paranoia sets, the more Operation  Strong-arm can be effective. Man, we've still got an immunity challenge to play. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Bob returning from Exile Island. <br/>How's it going, Bob? <br/>Good morning, gang. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: First things first-- take back the necklace, Susie. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will race across a series of balance beams carrying  a bag of puzzle blocks. When you reach the finish, you'll head back to the start, do it again. The first two people to get their three bags across the line move on to the  final round. In the final round, you will empty your bags filled with puzzle blocks. You must arrange those puzzle blocks along a multi-angled platform while  avoiding trip wires which could tip your blocks, forcing you to start over. <br/>Mmm. <br/>Probst: Your goal is to arrange your blocks so they will fall one into  another like dominoes, raising a flag. First person to raise their flag wins immunity, is guaranteed a one-in-seven  shot at winning this game and a million dollars. Losers, Tribal Council. Somebody will be voted out. Corinne, at the auction, you bought an advantage in today's immunity  challenge. You have the bottle? <br/>Please be something magical. This is good. "You will sit out for the first stage of this challenge and move  directly into the final round."  Probst: Huge advantage in this challenge. <br/>Thank you! <br/>Probst: Corinne is now guaranteed a one-in-three shot at winning this  challenge and staying alive in this game. Corinne gets to sit out the first round. Everybody else, we'll get started. Here we go. For immunity, first two people to finish move on to the final round. Survivors, ready? Go! Matty off to a quick start. Matty doesn't hesitate, has his first bag across. Kenny has his first bag across. It is Matty and Kenny. Bob is across. Susie's across. Matty across with his second bag. Sugar, no good, gotta go back. Here comes Kenny with his second bag. Matty's got his final bag. Susie with her second bag. Kenny makes it with his second bag. Bob falls off, no good. Gotta go back. Matty's across with three bags. Matty's moving on. Susie has her second bag. <br/>Damn it! <br/>Probst: Sugar and Crystal fall. One spot left to get to the final round. Who's going to get it? Kenny with a big leap. Kenny moves on to the final. It is Kenny, Matty, and Corinne in the final round. All right, in the final round, Kenny, Matty, Corinne. For immunity, survivors, ready? Go! Your job is to arrange those puzzle blocks like a nice line of dominoes. Matty, Corinne, starting at the front. Kenny moving to the end, working his way backwards, three different  strategies. Where this challenge gets tricky is when you have to start maneuvering with  those trip ropes. One wrong move on those trip ropes could knock over everything you've built  so far. Corinne making a lot of progress. Matty seems to have the early lead. Corinne taking her time. Kenny's pieces go down. Kenny may have made it more difficult, starting at the end. Matty very close to knocking everything over. Kenny picking up his fallen pieces. Corinne making a lot of progress. Question is: have you spaced them properly? Matty has a bit of a lead if he's right. Corinne still in it. Kenny and Matty arranging their last pieces. Matty has two blocks left. If he's wrong, it's a lot of work for nothing. Kenny gathering his last blocks. Kenny coming on strong now. Suddenly, Kenny's nearly complete. Everybody's still in this challenge. <br/>Jeff, I got it. <br/>Probst: Kenny's going to give it a shot. <br/>Push it? <br/>Probst: Push it. <br/>Come on! Go! Go! <br/>Probst: Kenny's doesn't work. He's got to rearrange it. Matty now heading back. Do not panic! Take your time! Corinne now looking good. Corinne, by being calm, has kept herself in this challenge. Matty has placed all his blocks. Is he ready to give it a try? <br/>Ready to give it a try, Jeff! <br/>All right, I'm going to try it again, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Kenny's ready to give another shot. <br/>I'm trying it, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Corinne is now going. Matty's in on it. This is it right here. Everybody has their blocks moving. Who is going to finish first? Matty's halfway through. Kenny's looking good. Million dollars on the line. Does it go, Corinne? <br/>Almost. Oh! Oh! Oh! <br/>Probst: No, Corinne's stopped short. Matty's doesn't go. <br/>Go! Go! Go! <br/>Probst: Kenny wins immunity! Kenny, come on over. Congratulations. With this around your neck, you are safe at tonight's Tribal Council. As for the rest of you, after 30 days, this game will come to an end for one  of you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. Congratulations. <br/>Randy and I needed to win. Now, I'm going on a wing and a prayer that Bob has the idol. I just need to figure out if he has it or not. I was so close. *  I can't believe it. <br/>I can. It's awesome! <br/>Hey, Kenny, good job. Very good job. <br/>Yeah, thanks, guys. <br/>Good job, bro. <br/>Matty was like so close, too. That was insane. <br/>I am 75% sure that I need the idol tonight because they're going to vote for  me. Ideally, tonight, Bob gives me the idol, and whoever Corinne, Bob, and I  decide to send home will be going home. Right now, it looks like Susie. <br/>Okay. Well, I... that's what I kind of feel like now, too. <br/>I really would feel guilty if Bob went home and I stayed. But if he even semi-offers it, I'm going to take it. <br/>I know you guys aren't going to believe me if I tell you I don't have the  idol. And you-you have to...  It wouldn't matter. I do believe you. I have your best interests in mind. Um, you can vote for whoever you want, but it might behoove you to vote  against Randy. <br/>We don't need him here. <br/>Yeah, I know. And it might buy you some time, and if it doesn't buy you some time, I got  another plan. Randy is an ass, and I loathe him with every inch of my being. <br/>Thanks, sweetie. Bye. <br/>Bye. The guy is a bigot. He offends everyone. And maybe that's his game, but I'm not even worried about that because  Randy's gone. You didn't tell anybody that you didn't find it, right? I think that Randy would fall for it. Your idol. <br/>If I give him the fake one? <br/>And it... it would be hilarious. <br/>If you think he'd fall for it, but I just, you know...  Yeah, don't worry. <br/>If we figure out a way for me to give it to Randy, I will do that. Sugar wants to play the joke on Randy. My life expectancy is a little bit better off allowing her to have the  satisfaction of me giving Randy the-the idol. I've got nothing to lose. It's not a real idol. I can't save myself with it. The only way I can save myself for another Tribal Council is by convincing  somebody else to use it, and I think it should do the trick. <br/>I want to run through the options with you. Okay, obviously, the only Hail Mary we've got is the idol, which I assume you  found. Okay. And you know you cannot tell anybody you found the idol, at all. Other than me or Randy, you cannot trust anybody, especially not Sugar. Obviously, if you found the idol, the smartest strategy would be to give it  to Randy if you thought that Randy was getting voted out 'cause it would save  us. <br/>If at the end of the day, I think they're going to go for Randy...  You're going to give it for Randy. <br/>I'm going to give it to Randy and the three of us vote for Susie. <br/>Yeah, no matter what, the three of us vote for Susie. I love you. Thank you for coming back. And thank you for finding the idol. <br/>That was...  I'm trying to figure out what to do. What I'm thinking is you've pissed everybody off so much...  I'm going tonight. <br/>If I gave you that idol...  Bob has not only told me that he has the idol, but he showed it to me. I saw it. It was two feet away from me. I am thrilled that Bob found the idol. I'm especially thrilled that he's willing to give it over to me. <br/>The hit is on Susie. <br/>Susie, yeah. <br/>Make sure Corinne and-and... all I can offer you now is, if you're in the  finals and I'm not, you got my vote for a million. <br/>Save some starch for me when we...  It's a deal. We got word that the hit is on, on me tonight, so Bob did one of the most,  uh, selfless acts I've ever seen, which was, uh, to give me his hidden  immunity idol. There is going to be some surprised people tonight, I think, and I'm here for  three more days. Looks like an idol to me. <br/>You're a genius. I cannot believe you did that. I cannot wait to see this. You are awesome. Thank you. <br/>Make it worth my while. <br/>Oh, I will. Don't worry. I'm making it worth your while. You kick butt, dude. (laughing)  Probst: I'll now bring in the members of our jury. Marcus and Charlie, voted out at the last Tribal Council. Let's start with the auction. It ended with what should have been a happy note. Randy buys a plate of chocolate chip cookies for the tribe, but it didn't go  down so smoothly. Sugar, what was your take on how it all played out? <br/>Well, Randy offered me his last cookie, which I wasn't really thinking about  it being his last cookie. I just thought that they were for the tribe, and so I took it, and I gave it to  Matty, and we've heard about it for three days. <br/>Probst: Randy, looking back on your actions, did you play it the right way? Was that appropriate? <br/>It wasn't the last cookie. It was my cookie. And honestly, I was testing her. I could have thrown them on the ground and stomped on them if I wanted to, or  I could have been generous like I was. <br/>Probst: So you think their reaction was maybe a little harsh because you did  offer everybody a cookie? <br/>Yes, and I even offered Sugar one twice. <br/>It's freaking cookies. My God, we're grown-ups. It's stupid. <br/>Probst: Susie, why is this seemingly funny story about a cookie so  representative of this game? <br/>You're really getting to know people's true colors and what they're really  like 'cause I have actually questioned, thinking, "God, you know, is  Randy really like this?" He's actually probably a person that's really  hurting. I feel kind of sorry for him because he probably is very sad. <br/>You know, actually, saying "I feel sorry" for somebody is another  way of saying, "How pathetic."  Oh, my apologies. I don't mean it that way. <br/>And I was totally sincere with the cookie, too. I swear I was. That's why I went off today. So...  Probst: Corinne, it sounds like something happened at camp today. Randy says he went off. What happened? <br/>I don't even know what started it, but all of a sudden, I hear something to  the effect of, "Shut up," directed from Randy at Susie. And it's a very awkward thing to be sitting through. <br/>Probst: Crystal, can you feel the tension ramping up as we get into the very  tail end of this game? <br/>I sure can feel the tension ramping up. Like, for instance, the cookie conversation that exploded into a blatant  disrespect to a grown woman... to me, under any other circumstances, that's hands  down for a slap. <br/>Probst: Is there any chance that Randy's playing some sort of game? <br/>If-if... if this is him, then he's giving it to me raw. And I will never talk to him outside of this situation. But if this is his game and no one's going to possibly reject me and I'm  going to get to the end, then that's his game. <br/>Probst: Bob, let's talk about your second trip to Exile Island. Is anybody brave enough to bring up the notion of the hidden immunity idol? <br/>Oh, oh, yeah, yeah. I made a point of not letting people know for sure whether I had it or I  didn't have it because it's part of the game. And I'm here to play. <br/>Probst: Randy, I know you're worried every time you come to Tribal, but with  so much animosity directed toward you, how worried are you tonight? <br/>You're wrong about one thing. I haven't been worried every time I come to Tribal. And I am a bit worried tonight, though. You're right about that. But 30 days is a pretty good run. <br/>Probst: So, if it's you tonight, you're okay with that? <br/>No, I would not be okay with leaving. I want to stay. <br/>Probst: With that, it is time to get to the vote. Kenny, you have the individual immunity necklace. You can keep it for yourself or give it to somebody else. <br/>I will keep it tonight, Jeff. <br/>Probst: You cannot vote for Kenny. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Matty, you're up. <br/>I'm voting you, Susie, 'cause payback's a bitch. <br/>You are a disgusting, old, hotheaded, chauvinistic, alcoholic bigot, and you  need to grow up before you die alone. And a loser. <br/>This vote is not strategic. It's strictly personal. <br/>(loudly): You have made my life hell from day one! Forget you! Go home! Good-bye. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. <br/>Probst: Thank you. The rules of Survivor state that if a hidden immunity idol is played, then  the votes cast against that person will not count, and the person with the  next highest number of votes will be voted out. This is not a hidden immunity idol. (laughing) All votes cast against Randy will count. I'll now read the votes. First vote... Randy. Randy-- two votes Randy. Susie. Susie. Two votes Randy; two votes Susie. That's three votes Susie; two votes Randy. Randy. That's three votes Randy; three votes Susie. Randy. That's four votes Randy; three votes Susie. One vote left. 11th person voted out of Survivor: Gabon, and the third member of our jury:  Randy. Need to bring me your torch. Randy, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Well, after tonight's Tribal Council, it's very clear this game is coming  down to one thing: trust. Can't wait to see how it plays out. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

The hell with these freaking people. I hope Corinne does well if she was not in on today's plot, and I don't think  she was. You know, most of the others, with the exception of Matty, I hope they get  bit by a green mamba.
