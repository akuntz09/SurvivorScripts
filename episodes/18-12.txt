<br/>Probst: Previously on Survivor:  Erinn's with us. She just feels like none of them care about her, so why should she care about  them? <br/>Probst: The Jalapao Three pulled in Erinn and took control of the game, but  Coach still wanted to call the shots. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: However, not everyone  Probst: However, not everyone was on board. was on board. <br/>Hmm-mm. <br/>Probst: Despite Taj and Erinn's rogue votes...  I couldn't vote for Sierra. <br/>Probst: ...Coach got his way. Sierra, the tribe has spoken. Six are left. Six are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Well, final six, guys. Congratulations. <br/>That's not a small accomplishment. <br/>I am so tired. <br/>I'm glad the drama's gone. <br/>Amen. I just hope we can get some sleep tonight. <br/>Erinn and Taj took the cowardly way out and voted for two people who didn't  deserve to be voted for: Stephen and Debbie. It was preposterous. Erinn and Taj need to be cut off at the kneecaps. I'm pissed at them for writing your name down and for writing Stephen's name  down tonight. That was ridiculous. <br/>You've got to let it go. <br/>This is the time for the warrior alliance. There's a reason why we have a name. People that don't play this game even half as honestly as me, even half as  bold as me, like we saw tonight, pisses me off. I have two words for you. Taj and Erinn. You know what? We're going to run them through with a sword the next two votes. And I'm thinking Taj has to go next. <br/>You got to let it go or it's going to drive you nuts. <br/>What a bunch of freaking cowards. I'm so pissed at them. <br/>All right, I'm going to go back in there 'cause I don't want them to think  we're out here. All right, I'll see you tomorrow. <br/>I just wanted to tell you that I was backing you up on the fact that they  were cowardly lions. <br/>Coach does not let things go. without a complete, utter dialogue as to why. It gets so old. He called me over to talk. He's really upset. I said, "I know, but it's over." I said, "I know, but it's  over." You know? You know? <br/>I don't care about the million dollars. I care about my integrity and honesty and changing this game from start to  finish, and I've said that from day one, and that will never change. Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION  NETWORK TELEVISION  Coach and I have been together since day one, but lately, it's been not a  positive thing for me. <br/>Jet, come here. <br/>Jet. As a social person in a social game, it is not good for me to be attached to  Coach. He's a downer. People are tired of comments and directives and not doing a whole lot around  camp, really hadn't been for a while. So, I laid in bed last night, and it came to me and I thought, you know what? I got to step up. I got to step up. Hey. Hey. <br/>Sounds fishy. <br/>Things are coming out that I didn't sign up for, and I think that you guys  probably feel the same. You know what I'm saying? We're going to have to talk. <br/>I love him. <br/>I love him, too, but we'll have to...  Yeah. <br/>Debbie is playing a very strategical game, and she's scared right now, and,  uh, Debbie may be more of a loose cannon than I thought. Debbie may be up to some no good around here. I'm so sick of Debbie. <br/>I'm starting to really dislike her. [imitating Debbie]: J.T., you gonna saw this with me? You think it's going to rain today? <br/>[imitating Debbie]: I think it's clearing up. <br/>J.T...  I guess you're talking about me. What's going on, guys? Hey, I don't know what you all have been talking about, but I don't want  Coach speaking for me. Now, I will tell you this, and I don't like going against Coach, but as far  as I'm concerned, I'm on a tribe with you two and I'm in an alliance with you  two, and I give you my honest to God, pinky swear word on that, God strike me  dead. [thunder rumbles] I am in it with you two. <br/>All right, good, okay. <br/>Good, good. <br/>Good, all right. <br/>I love you, Debbie. <br/>And then we're going to go party in Biloxi. I love you. I'm so glad you're in my life. <br/>I know. <br/>Debbie is a very strategic player, and I think people don't give her enough  credit because she is sweet and because she is chattery, but she has  definitely got a lot going on underneath that persona, and she worries me  that persona, and she worries me a little bit. a little bit. a little bit. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys.

I'm feeling my own heart increasing in volume. This is big. <br/>Are they any good? [laughing]  Probst: Last item. <br/>What? <br/>Last item? <br/>Whoa. <br/>Probst: This is a Samsung Instinct by Sprint. This phone does a lot. One thing it can do right now is bring you love from home. Loaded on this phone are messages from your loved ones. You are going to be bidding on a chance to see the video message that your  loved one sent to you. Only one person can buy this and win this. But for this item, you can pool money, meaning if somebody wants to give you  their money, they can. Let's start the bidding. <br/>Here, Taj. <br/>Probst: For the Samsung Instinct by Sprint. Loved one's messages from home. Everybody is giving their money to Taj. <br/>That's so sweet. <br/>Probst: What does that say about this group of six in a game that can be  rather nasty at times? <br/>Taj has had a tougher time than the rest of us. Debbie has kids, but Taj left a little baby at home. <br/>Probst: Taj, you're not even going to have to bid against anybody. <br/>I know. You guys, I love you to death for giving me this. <br/>You just go enjoy it. You need it. <br/>Probst: All right, Taj, let me officially put it up for bid. The Sprint loved one message from home. $20? $20? <br/>I want it. I want it. <br/>I want it. I want it. What are you giving me, 20 bucks, your card? <br/>Everything. <br/>Probst: You don't need to give me all. Well, here. <br/>Probst: $20. All right, Taj. Get that so you can see it. <br/>Hey, babe. Wait for number one, two, and three, and four. No, I'm just kidding. We're all here wanting to say hello to you. We miss you so much. As you can see, the house is not the same without you. We are sending you out much love and energy. We're praying for you every single day. You have any concerns of anything going on here, no, we've got it locked down. So you just put all your focus and attention on your task at hand. We're holding it down here at the George household. See you back at the camp. [smooching loudly] [sobbing]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: Did you hear that last line? <br/>I did. <br/>Probst: There's one line on there, might have been a little hard to hear. There's one...  See you back at the camp! Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>What?! <br/>Probst: Just dawned on her. <br/>Oh, my God! Thank you so much! Thank you! <br/>That's wonderful. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! Can we go now? <br/>Probst: Taj, come on back up here. I'll tell you how it's going to work. So the last thing Eddie said on this tape was, "I'll see you back at  camp." Which means just what you think it does. The bad news is he's the only loved one that's coming back to camp, but  everyone can have a loved one back at camp if you're willing to make a  sacrifice. If instead of taking Eddie back to camp, you will instead send yourself to  Exile Island, where Eddie will come with you...  Oh! Oh! <br/>Probst: Then everybody else gets a loved one back at camp. <br/>I'll do it! I'll do it! <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>Yeah, baby! <br/>I'll do it. <br/>I'll do it. <br/>Okay, can we go now? <br/>A romantic night in the dunes. Are you crazy? <br/>Exactly. <br/>Probst: Here's a map. Not that you need it. <br/>Where do I go? <br/>Probst: Right up this way. <br/>Bye, guys. Have fun. <br/>Have fun, Taj. <br/>Thank you, Taj! <br/>Probst: Taj will return back into the game in time for the next immunity  challenge. I know you guys are ready to get back to camp. Grab your stuff. Get out of here. Have a good afternoon. Have a good afternoon. <br/>Thanks, Jeff! <br/>Thanks, Jeff! [screaming] [laughing]  Oh, missing you, babe! Missing you! Missing you! <br/>Oh, baby! <br/>Oh, baby! <br/>Golly, you look bad. [laughing]  I do. Look at that. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I've been wearing this dress for a month. My husband jumps out from behind a tree and he just looked like an angel. He just looked like a big old muscle-bound... I just wanted to take him to  the side to have a conjugal visit. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Look at my back. Look at me legs. They've been killing me. I'm like the bugs' favorite treat out here. <br/>Golly, you've lost so much weight! <br/>I don't eat. <br/>She looks great. I mean, she looks... she looks happy, you know. She doesn't look withered or worn down. She's dirty now. She smells filthy, you know, but there's something about the wild, you know,  that make you sexy, you know. It's kind of a turn-on, you know? know? This is all right. This is all right. <br/>Funky D, what's up?! <br/>Oh, my God. There's my daughter. There's my baby. <br/>Oh, my God, I am so happy to see you! <br/>Awesome! <br/>Awesome! <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, my God! I don't want you to have to see. <br/>I was crying. <br/>I was crying. <br/>Like my home? <br/>Like my home? <br/>I am so gross. You're going to need to disinfect yourself. <br/>As soon as I saw my brother standing there with his hand over his mouth. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>It was just like shock at seeing me. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>I just, like, gave him a big hug. I mean it was maybe one of the like most just biggest, sincerest, like,  warmest hug we've ever shared, like, if not the most. <br/>What do you think of this place? Can you believe I've lived here 31 days? <br/>I cannot say. It's... No. <br/>Pretty river, isn't it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>When I saw Adrianna, she was crying. It was real huge. I mean, it was like, I didn't care about nothing. I just had to get with my little sister, you know. Put it on. I want to see it. <br/>All right. <br/>That looks nice on you. <br/>You look great. You look healthy. You look thin. <br/>Don't eat me! <br/>I sleep right here. Those are my pants. Here's my stuff. My dad was proud of me just for coming out here. <br/>Now you know that's all you need. <br/>Yeah. He was like, "Wait a minute. You're doing this. What the hell?" Like, I'm always dressed up. I'm always super girly and, like, I think for him to see me outside of that  was a little bit shocking to him. <br/>Hey, man, guess what they call me in this game? Dragonslayer because I'm slaying all the dragons. I'm running this freaking show, let me tell you that right now. I think I'll be in the final two. <br/>I hope so. <br/>Unless something crazy comes up. If you were to say you could have filet mignon or you can see your assistant  coach for ten minutes, I would say I want to minutes, I would say I want to  see my assistant coach. see my assistant coach. [back cracking] Ah. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. about. Get this, too. Get this, too. Yeah, no, push, forward, more. We are not doing weird sexual positions, by the way. It's just I haven't had my back It's just I haven't had my back cracked. cracked. <br/>What is that? <br/>Corongutoba. You can make tortillas out of it. <br/>You can? Mm-hmm. Here, try it. <br/>Suck on the pit for a while. Don't break your teeth. <br/>Smells like dirty feet, kind of. <br/>That's my favorite snack we got. <br/>You don't have to finish it. I know. I know. We love it. We love it. <br/>Mm. <br/>Mm. <br/>And another thing you have to be careful of out here is like the scorpions  and stuff like to hide under the branches so you be careful where you grab it. <br/>Scorpions, huh? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Underneath where? <br/>They're more afraid of you than you of them. <br/>I don't want to find out. You know what, I played ball. I played against great Steeler defenses; I played against great players like  Ray Lewis, but, oh, snakes, scorpions, spiders... I'm like, "What?! You live with... these are your You live with... these are your friends  now?" friends now?"  Look at you! That's my man! Okay. Let's get some on there. Keep it going. <br/>I have a newfound respect for her doing this for 31 days, and not any help  and standing strong. I know plenty of women that wouldn't even think about coming out here and  enduring this. So, you know, she gets all of my love for this one. She's the best. <br/>I'll be home soon. <br/>This is your half... not halftime. This is the fourth-quarter prep. <br/>Seeing my husband just, just... it really helped me. He is my fire. He is the love of my life. So it was just like the skies just parted; the sun came out. I just... and nothing else hurt I just... and nothing else hurt after that. after that. <br/>You're doing great, man. You're doing amazingly. <br/>It's okay. <br/>Huh? <br/>I just hate breaking down. <br/>Why? <br/>You know, it's like you're not... you don't think about these things, but  when I'm out here I don't think about that... I try not to think about the I  try not to think about the people I'm missing at home. people I'm missing at home. <br/>They're good. She told me to tell you that she loves you. And wants to know when you're getting back. <br/>I never thought I'd miss you and Mom and Jamie so much. <br/>Wishing you could be with the cows. the cows. <br/>I know, me, too. <br/>I know, me, too. <br/>And I'm so glad I did it because it's changed... it's changed me to be a  better person, to not take things for granted. Look at my hands. <br/>It's okay. That will all fix. That will all fix. <br/>Today has been the most emotional day for my husband and I. It just showed how really intense our love is for each other. It meant the world to me that my husband came out here to support me. I didn't want him to go, though. <br/>Very cool thing, like, I've definitely changed a lot. I'm a total badass. That's all I have to say about that. Now when I go home, like, there's somebody that I don't have to explain this  to. And to have somebody here that you can just tell everything to, and know that  he wouldn't use anything against you. Somebody who loves you no matter what. Somebody's who's worried about you, somebody who's concerned about you, was a  really great thing. Out here you kind of forget what that feels like, and it's really nice. <br/>It's good to meet you, Dave. <br/>Good to meet you, J.T., and good luck to you. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Hey. You've got a good woman. She cares a lot about you. <br/>Thanks. <br/>She does. I mean that. <br/>I'm so glad everybody was here. <br/>I don't want you all to go. <br/>I know, I know. <br/>Okay, bye. <br/>Good to meet you, Coach. <br/>You, too. <br/>Good luck to you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Please don't tell Mom how skinny I am. Oh, I had a tough time saying good-bye. It was really, really hard to let go of him. All I can see is my dad, and I just want to be there, and I want to hang out  with him, and it was awesome. <br/>I love you. <br/>I love you, too. <br/>Oh! I can't wait to come home. <br/>I'm so proud of you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>You're the best, you know that? <br/>Yes. [laughter]  I love you. <br/>I love you more. I won't smell like this for long. <br/>I know. That's okay. I love you. <br/>I love you! <br/>Don't let the bedbugs bite! <br/>Don't let the bedbugs bite! <br/>Too late! <br/>Too late! <br/>Cool today. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Kind of cool this morning. <br/>Yeah, it is. Day 32. Can't believe that. <br/>So when he's on a walk today, let's try to figure out how we can get out  because I came up with some other ideas, too. <br/>Okay. <br/>Things we need to think of down the line. <br/>Right, okay. Debbie's opened up like white on rice in the past few days. And that leads me to believe that she's turning her game face on. She's throwing Coach under the bus right now, and they've been bus right now,  and they've been tight since day one. tight since day one. You gotta watch out for people like that. <br/>...Good to always be talking strategy and stuff. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Um, I really think Taj needs to go. I have this gut feeling, I keep thinking that if she plays the immunity idol,  then one of us could go home. You see what I'm saying? I'm not trying to get paranoid, but I just don't want any wild cards sneaking  up on us, you know what I'm saying? Does that sound like a plan? <br/>That sounds like a plan. <br/>All right, I'm not trying to push, uh, Taj down your throat. I want you to feel comfortable about that. <br/>No, I understand completely. <br/>I just have a feeling about it, man. <br/>Yeah, we'll do that. We'll talk with Stephen today. We can't let Taj in our ear anymore. <br/>Uh-uh. <br/>I'm going to go get some more wood. <br/>Coach's strategy's not the same as mine at this point in the game. I feel like I'm really like a few steps ahead of Coach when it comes to  strategy. I tell him what he wants to hear at this point to make it look like I'm on  the same page he's on, when in turn, you know, we're not really on the same  we're not really on the same page right now. page right now. <br/>I just feel like, you know, exactly, like I said...  Okay, wait. Do you agree, Erinn? <br/>Yeah. Yeah, I agree. <br/>Um, he definitely don't do nothing around camp. <br/>And also, I think I'm just ready to see him go. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's going to have to be like we did, like y'all did with Tyson. It's got to be a blindside. <br/>Right. <br/>Sure. <br/>But it has to be every single one of us writing it down. <br/>Yeah. <br/>He's going to be furious or devastated more. But he's going to feel mostly betrayed by me. Talk is, and this is going to break his heart and he's going to feel like I  have definitely betrayed him, but the talk is for Coach to be the next one to  go. So, he's going to think we're voting off Taj. <br/>Yep. <br/>That's who Coach will think we're voting for. <br/>Exactly. <br/>Okay. <br/>He's pretty much driving everybody crazy in the camp right now, including me  at times. Coach thinks he's in an alliance with myself, J.T., and Stephen. But J.T. and Stephen have had it as well. <br/>At least in the next vote, we gotta be secure in what we do. <br/>Okay, I think we need to go ahead and kick Coach out 'cause ahead and kick  Coach out 'cause he's driving everybody insane. he's driving everybody insane. Honestly, you are two of the people that I care most about in this whole  thing and I will do anything in my power for you two to be sitting there at  the very end. I swear to you. I swear to God I will. And honestly, I'll even do this for y'all. If I have the immunity idol, and it's down to us three, I will give it to one  of you so I can be voted out. <br/>Wow. <br/>And I mean that. I'm happy with third. Swear to God. I would hand it to you, J.T. <br/>That's awesome, Debbie. You're an incredible person. <br/>I would do it. I swear to you, I'd do it. <br/>You cannot really trust anybody's promises out here. I don't know Debbie that well. I've known her for ten days. I don't know her personal relationship with God or what her swears to God  mean, but, you know, it's a very lucrative offer. A lock for sure on the final two. <br/>She just told Stephen and myself that she would do anything to see me and him  in the final two. Those were her exact words. <br/>Okay, she's out. <br/>With Debbie making that promise to Stephen and myself, it also makes me  wonder what other promises she's made to other people, uh, because she shows  she's willing to do whatever it takes to move forward in this game, even if  she says she only wants third place. Nobody wants third place in this game. <br/>Did she tell Taj the same thing? <br/>Yep, yep. <br/>Yep, yep. She goes. She goes. She goes. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Taj returning from Exile Island. <br/>Come on, Taj! <br/>Come on, Taj! <br/>Hey! <br/>Hey! <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: First things first,  Probst: First things first, Coach. Coach. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going to make your way through a series of  obstacles. You'll dig your way under a log. You'll go across a balance beam, then under a rope crawl and out into a field  where you will find ten spinning math symbols. You'll memorize the sequence of symbols, then race back to your answer board  and write them down in the same sequence to solve a math equation. First person to get all the symbols right and the correct answer to the  equation wins immunity and is guaranteed a one-in-...  ALL: Five. <br/>Probst: Five shot at winning the million bucks. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: We'll draw for spots. <br/>Probst: We'll draw for spots. We'll get started. We'll get started. Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready? Survivors ready? Go! Go! First stage is dig a big hole. So you can crawl under. Lost a lot of weight out here, but you still want to make sure you can get  your butt through that hole. that hole. J.T. gonna give it a shot. J.T. gonna give it a shot. J.T. is stuck. J.T. is halfway through. Taj giving it a shot. Taj is stuck. Taj is stuck. J.T. is through! J.T. is through! J.T. moving through to the crawl-through. J.T. having a big lead right now. Memorize as many of those Memorize as many of those symbols as you can in one  shot. symbols as you can in one shot. Debbie's through the crawl-through. [mumbling] Plus, plus. <br/>Probst: Stephen gonna have to dig a lot more to squeeze through. J.T. across the beam. Gotta get back through that hole now before he can start working on the  answer. Coach is now through. He's heading out. J.T. starting to work on his answer. Taj is through now. Taj is through now. Stephen squeaks through. Stephen squeaks through. Stephen falls off. J.T. heading out to try and remember some more symbols. remember some more symbols. Stephen falls off again. Stephen falls off again. Debbie back. J.T.'s across again. Stephen cannot get across the balance beam. He's quickly falling out of this challenge. Taj taking a look at the symbols. J.T. racing back. Coach heading back. Erinn is finally through! Stephen finally across the balance beam, but way behind. Debbie heading back. J.T. back from his second trip, filling in the last of the symbols. J.T. working on the math portion of this. The symbols have to be right in The symbols have to be right in order for the  math to be right. order for the math to be right. Coach back with his first set of symbols. Stephen heading back after being out there a long time. Debbie back from her second trip. Taj back from her first trip. Coach going to head out looking for more symbols. Debbie working on the math. J.T. doing the math. Stephen back with his first set of symbols. He was out there a long time. He was out there a long time. How many can his brain hold? How many can his brain hold? Taj heading back out. With only one look at the symbols, Stephen's doing all of this on one pass. Is he right? <br/>So, two minus...  Probst: It's J.T. and Stephen  Probst: It's J.T. and Stephen neck and neck. neck and neck. <br/>Jeff, is that right? <br/>Probst: Stephen thinks he has it. <br/>I got it. <br/>Probst: If he did it, he did it with only one look at the it with only one  look at the symbols. symbols. Stephen is right! Stephen wins immunity! <br/>Oh, my God! I won immunity! I can't even believe it! I can't even believe it! [cheering] [cheering]  Probst: Stephen, I gotta ask you. You memorized all ten symbols in one pass. <br/>Well, I divided... I made each symbol be a number so I had plus is one,  divided by is four, times is three. And I know the brain can remember a seven-digit number 'cause that's why  phone numbers are seven digits. So, I divided it into two numbers, um, and just remembered those two numbers. <br/>Probst: Well, it worked. Come on over. <br/>All right, Stephen! <br/>Probst: That was one of the biggest come-from-behind victories ever. <br/>I was pretty much last. <br/>Probst: With this around his neck, Stephen is safe at tonight's Tribal  Council. J.T., Debbie, Coach, Taj, Erinn, after 33 days out here, one of you going  home tonight. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. Nice work. <br/>Thanks a lot, Jeff. <br/>I look over at Stephen and I see the necklace around his neck, and it was  just like I got the necklace. You know, every time something goes our way, I try hard not to do it, but I  always look at Stephen and smile because he knows just like I do we just keep  battling it out. Keep doing what we're doing. Keep doing what we're doing. We can do this. We can do this. <br/>Good job, Steve-o! <br/>Thank you. <br/>Steve-o. Steve-o! <br/>The day I did not think would come. <br/>I'm going to go and rinse off. <br/>Me, too. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Let me get some of this sand off. J.T. and I, we came into this merge basically expecting to be picked off. And now we're in the dominant position. Now the Timbira people are individually coming to us and, you know, begging  for our mercy. So to have done that together with Taj and J.T., to have stuck tight, even  when all of these different factions were vying for our attentions, we feel  pretty good about it. <br/>Debbie thinks Coach...  Debbie is strategical woman of the year. <br/>Oh, my God. She's sucking up to everybody. <br/>She promised us if we'd take her to the final three, she would give up  immunity and take third place. <br/>Get out. <br/>Which we don't believe. <br/>In the same day, she said we've got to get rid of Erinn. <br/>Get out. <br/>So, I said, "Erinn, when you got nauseous at the end, Debbie just threw  you under the bus." She said, "Coach, then you, and then Taj, of  course, next."  Oh, Lord. He's like, "Are you okay out here?" I was like, "I have two  brothers that are taking care of me."  Taj really trusts Stephen and myself. I mean, we're her only two guys out here. It's good to know, you know, that she's still sticking with us, but no one  else in this entire tribe knows what's really entire tribe knows what's  really going on like Stephen and I do. going on like Stephen and I do. <br/>Huh? The more you think about it? <br/>The Debbie thing is not a good idea. What do you think? The downsides of losing Debbie are she is a really hard worker around camp. She is a very strong positive presence. I actually think she would step aside at three and let J.T. and me have it. <br/>Man, that spa was so nice right now. <br/>We went at the wrong time. We went when it was overcast and gross. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You feeling good? <br/>I'm feeling good now. <br/>My ass. [laughing]  Other downsides to losing Debbie are a couple more days here with Coach. <br/>I think about it, and I've got my instincts saying you've got to get rid of  Taj next because if she has the idol, she's going to play the five. <br/>We're solid, man, the four of us. We don't have nothing to worry about. The only thing to get in our way is the idol. We play this right, that's over with. That's done. Coach, you know, he's always wanting to reassure that things are going his  way, and it's just hard to deal with him. I mean, I don't want to lie to him. <br/>All the way, fellas. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Do you guys realize... I'm just going to tell you this right now. I'm just going to throw a reality check on you. One of us three is going to win it. <br/>I hate lying to anybody, so anybody I got to lie to, I try to avoid them. So the sooner I get the people I've got to lie to out of the I've got to lie  to out of the game, the better. game, the better. <br/>Whether or not Debbie is scheming, whether or not Coach is delusional, right  now it doesn't matter. We need to figure each move strategically to make things easier for the next  move. We don't need any of them to be loyal right now; as long as we have a strong  alliance, we can have a strong alliance, we can pick them off one by one. pick them off one by one. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Brendan, Tyson, and Sierra, voted out at the last Tribal Council. Coach, from the beginning of this game, you've talked about going to the end  with the best players. <br/>Right. <br/>Probst: With only six people left, everybody can't be equally deserving. <br/>I think that, you know, what might be considered a strength in my mind might  not be a strength in somebody else's mind. Stephen, you know, he's a warrior to me because he has gone from a boy who  likes to read books about adventure to a man who is living an adventure and  excelling at it without any complaints. <br/>Probst: Let's go a little further with this. How about Debbie? Why should she be here at the end and not someone else sitting up here? <br/>I'd say that Debbie is playing the game for the same reasons that I am, and  that is for integrity. And so that's why we paired up on day three because I know she will never lie  to me, no matter what. <br/>Probst: And because you feel that way, that makes her the best to go to the  end. <br/>I trust her implicitly. She will not lie to me in this game. <br/>Probst: Taj, how risky is that for Coach to say, "I paired up with  Debbie on day three?"  Um, it's not risky. That's what people do. You build alliances. You do what you have to do to survive in the game, and he's done a great job. He's a warrior. He's a dragonslayer. He-He's...  Probst: A warrior. <br/>That's what he says. He's a warrior...  Probst: That's what you said. <br/>Because that's what he calls himself. <br/>I didn't come up with that, by the way. <br/>Probst: Let me guess: some chief in a small village... [laughter]  That's fine. Hey, every time we come in here and you want to try to cut me down because  you want to try to ferret out the truth, I love it. <br/>Probst: Okay. Let's take it to the next step. Tell me about Taj. What is it that makes her best to go to the end? <br/>When I saw the raw emotions of her the other day at the auction, you know,  she has made the ultimate sacrifice, taking time away from her son that  she'll never get back. And so, that is incredible. <br/>Probst: Coach, how hard would it be to vote out Taj tonight after making that  sacrifice so that you guys could all get your loved ones? <br/>I think every time that each one of us sit here and analyze each person up  here, we all think, "Is it justifiable?" And obviously, coming on  the heels of her doing something like that, it would be very difficult for  any of us to want to vote her out tonight. <br/>Probst: Now, let's turn the tables. J.T., what makes Coach worthy? He talks about wanting to take the best to the end. What if he's not one of the best? <br/>Anyone that will stand here and put himself out on the line and be this  honest, you know, has never told a lie, deserves to go as far as his body can  stand. <br/>Debbie, what is working against Coach making it to the end? <br/>I think Coach is determined to be honest. And this is a game that honesty is huge, but can it really last through the  duration of this game? I don't know. But if there is an Achilles' heel on Coach, that could be it. <br/>Probst: Erinn, is tonight's vote going to surprise somebody? <br/>Um, there might be surprises tonight. <br/>Probst: Debbie, how will tonight's vote change this game? <br/>Um, that's a really good question, Jeff. I think that it's going to change the way this tribe behaves and how we're  going to figure out who belongs where, and, um, I do think it will be a  surprise. <br/>Probst: Stephen, you have the individual immunity necklace. As always, it's yours to assign to somebody else if you want or keep it for  yourself. <br/>I'm going to hold on to it, Jeff. <br/>Probst: You cannot vote for Stephen. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. It's time to vote. Coach, you're up. Coach, you're up. <br/>Taj, you're a beautiful soul. <br/>Taj, you're a beautiful soul. Best of luck. Best of luck. <br/>I'm sorry, Coach, but this game is changing, and you wanted to play it with  honesty and integrity, and it's time for you to go. to go. Hope you forgive me. Hope you forgive me. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be  the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote: Taj. First vote: Taj. Coach. Coach. One vote Taj; one vote Coach. One vote Taj; one vote Coach. Debbie. One vote Taj; one vote Coach; One vote Taj; one vote Coach; one vote Debbie. one vote Debbie. Debbie. That's two votes Debbie; That's two votes Debbie; one vote Taj; one vote  Coach. one vote Taj; one vote Coach. 11th person voted out and the fourth member of our jury: Debbie. That's three. That's enough. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Debbie, the tribe has spoken. Debbie, the tribe has spoken. Debbie, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. Well, there's no doubt the best players will make it to the end. The more interesting question: of the five of you, who's the best of the best? Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.

And I know that it was a hard decision for them to make to vote me off  tonight. I don't hold any grudges. This is a game and you got to play it the best. I'm anxious to sit on the jury I'm anxious to sit on the jury and see what  goes down.
