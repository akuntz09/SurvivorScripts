<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor: Drop your buffs. It is now time to integrate. The four-tribe ethnic division... You are the new Aitu tribe. You are the new Raro tribe. ...dissolved into a melting pot. Two new tribes, a whole new Two new tribes, a whole new game. game. At the new Raro tribe...  There are so many men on this tribe now. Seems like we got all the, like, really big, buff guys. Your pants are falling off, Your pants are falling off, Nate. Nate. I'm absolutely going to flirt with him. It's what I do best. <br/>Probst: At the new Aitu...  I trust Yul, I trust Candice. <br/>I totally agree. <br/>Probst: ...new plans were laid. <br/>Becky came right to me. She said, " Yul and I would like to get together with you and  Candice." I said, "I believe that I have Flicka." Stay with me  and Candice and we'll take these other two and the five of us will go to the  merge. <br/>Probst: And Yul solidified his bond with Becky. <br/>I found the idol. <br/>It's so awesome. <br/>It's a huge advantage to have someone that you absolutely trust. <br/>Oh, I'm so excited! <br/>Give it all you got, go! <br/>Probst: During the immunity challenge... Yul going try to fight them off as  long as he can. ...Aitu was outmatched by the brawn of the new Raro tribe. Raro wins immunity. Raro sent Candice to Exile Island, saving her from tribal council and  jeopardizing the council and jeopardizing the Aitu alliance. Aitu alliance. <br/>Probst: Suddenly Becky was on the chopping block. the chopping block. <br/>Jonathan...  Jonathan...  I thought Flicka was me, so we've got a serious problem here. <br/>We have to let Becky go. She's a princess out here. <br/>She's not, like, weak, she's strong. <br/>Probst: Yul and Jonathan scrambled to save Becky. <br/>If five of us vote for Cecilia and three of you vote for Becky, then all of a  sudden you're on the outside. Trying to convince Flicka and Cao Boi to vote with us is the key. If not, then, all bets are off and it's going to be a whole different kettle  of fish. <br/>Probst: At tribal council it came down to Becky or Cecilia. In the end, it was Ozzy's former tribemate who was voted out. out. Cecilia, the tribe has spoken. Cecilia, the tribe has spoken. 17 are left. 17 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>At tribal council tonight it came very close. I received three votes and Cecilia received five. The alliance that I feel pretty comfortable with and pretty confident is Yul  for sure, Candice is right now on Exile Island, she's still in the alliance,  and Jonathan said that he would stay in the that he would stay in the  alliance, too. alliance, too. <br/>No, no. <br/>Coconut. <br/>I don't like hermit crabs. I feel like I'm on the outside. To lose the only member of my former tribe, the person that helped me lay the  foundations of everything that these people are going to enjoy makes me are  going to enjoy makes me feel like crap. feel like crap. If they want to vote me out they should do it soon so I don't have to keep  catching food for them. I just don't feel like playing I just don't feel like playing along any more. along any more. along any more. [theme song playing] [theme song playing] Captioning sponsored by CBS  PARAMOUNT NETWORK CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION TELEVISION  Is that Candice? <br/>Candice. Look at her waving like Miss America. [laughter]  Candice! <br/>Hey, guys. <br/>How was it? <br/>No idol. <br/>No idol. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>I think probably because I'm  I think probably because I'm the youngest, or whatever. the youngest, or whatever. <br/>You think they did it, like,  You think they did it, like, as a bad thing? as a bad thing? <br/>I don't know, you guys are asking good questions because I haven't even  thought about any of this. I didn't have time. I think probably Adam and Parvati told their tribe to send me to exile. But I don't want the rest of the team to think that I have some special, you  know, get out of jail free card from the other team. And everybody's like, "Yeah, what do you think, what do you think?"  And I said, "Well, I don't know, I hadn't thought about that."  that." You know, just played dumb. You know, just played dumb. <br/>Oh, I didn't even think about that. about that. My mind is... My mind is... My mind is...  Feels soft already. <br/>Feels soft already. <br/>Feels soft already. [laughter] [laughter]  Like Sunday night football. <br/>I know. It was kind of annoying that the guys were just sitting and just waiting  there and drinking all the coconuts they could drink and the girls were, you  know, working on improving our shelter. They're starting to rule the roost a little bit. I think they're getting very comfortable with their position in this tribe. Because they know that we need Because they know that we need them, they're  strong. them, they're strong. <br/>No. <br/>No way. <br/>You think they were? <br/>I don't know. <br/>Even if they all do think, what's that going to do to us? Nothing. You know, we're all fired up on how dominant and strong we are as a tribe  right now. As a group of guys we're way, way stronger than the other tribe's group of  guys. And I think the testosterone's flying a little bit and the guys want to stick  together. These girls are going to need manpower for sure. So the four guy alliance is So the four guy alliance is definitely relaxed. definitely relaxed. definitely relaxed. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. Raro, getting your first look at the new Aitu tribe. Cecilia voted out at the last Cecilia voted out at the last tribal council. tribal council. All right, today's challenge is for reward. Each tribe will select two tribe members to be attached by belt to a very  long rope that snakes over, under and around a series of obstacles. The rest of the tribe will push and pull those two tribe members through all  of the obstacles. At the end of the rope is a decoder table. Once the entire tribe reaches the table, one tribe member will swim out to a  barrel, dive down, unclip a decoding wheel. Bring it back to shore and the entire tribe will use that decoding wheel to  decipher one phrase. First tribe to correctly decipher the phrase wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Warmth and comfort. Three blankets, two pillows, one hammock. In addition, the winning tribe will choose one person from the losing tribe  to go to Exile Island. They will stay there until the next immunity challenge. Raro, you have one extra member. Who's sitting this challenge out? <br/>I am. <br/>Probst: Stephannie. All right, we will get you All right, we will get you belted up and we'll get  going. belted up and we'll get going.

Still a tight race. <br/>Hold the rope, go up here, go up here, Jenny. Come up, come up, come up. <br/>Probst: Both tribes are neck and neck. <br/>Come on, baby, you're doing great. <br/>Probst: Aitu's working together well. <br/>Keep going. <br/>Hold on to me. <br/>Hold on to me. <br/>Come on! <br/>Come on! <br/>We got to go under or over the rope. <br/>I understand that, but now it's tangled. <br/>Slack's not going to do anything. <br/>Probst: Raro does not agree on the strategy. Costing them time. <br/>Don't worry about that, good, good. <br/>Probst: Aitu on to the puzzle part of the challenge. All eight got to touch. <br/>Go, Ozzy, go. <br/>Probst: Raro's caught up in their rope. <br/>Come on, guys, it's not over, stay in it. <br/>Probst: Ozzy getting ready for a swim.

Ozzy already has the wheel, he's heading back. <br/>Go, Ozzy. <br/>Probst: Raro not giving up. <br/>Just get it in there. <br/>Probst: Now you have to decipher the message. Use that wheel. <br/>Is that "A"? "A," right here. <br/>Probst: Trying to figure out which letter goes with which number to solve the  phrase. <br/>Where's "K"? <br/>It's not going to work. What's seven? 11, give me 11. <br/>"A", 11 is "A". <br/>Six? <br/>"L". <br/>This doesn't work. <br/>Probst: Raro trying to make up some time. <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Probst: They are still in this challenge  Go, go. <br/>Probst: Brad into in the  Probst: Brad into in the water. water. <br/>Seven is "W". <br/>No, it's not working. <br/>Probst: Aitu nowhere close at this point. <br/>Come on, Raro, you're doing it, baby, you're doing it. <br/>Probst: Brad has unclipped the decoding wheel and heading the decoding wheel  and heading back. back. <br/>Nice, Brad. <br/>One is "W". <br/>Are you sure? <br/>Probst: Both tribes working on the puzzle now. <br/>Try the small words first. first. <br/>Is 12 "T"? <br/>Is 12 "T"? <br/>Is 12 "T"? <br/>This has got to be a vowel. <br/>This has got to be a vowel. <br/>Five is "B", five is "B". <br/>Cast away-- we're done. <br/>We're done. <br/>Probst: Aitu thinks they  Probst: Aitu thinks they have it. have it.

I feel that I have the most power. If they lose me then they're going to be losing a lot of strength. <br/>I think we should call him Poseidon now or something. <br/>Yes, King Neptune. <br/>Because he's the god of the sea, right? sea, right? [laughter] [laughter]  Yeah, that was just so frustrating. <br/>Well, you guys, there's a bright side to this. We need to be humbled, [a]. We got humbled. We got humbled. So, hey, no one is going home. So, hey, no one is going home. <br/>We were just bummed out that we lost. We took a lot of pride in winning. And then also bummed that Adam And then also bummed that Adam got sent to  Exile Island. got sent to Exile Island.

They can't go on wet. They can't go on wet. <br/>J.P. is very demanding, and I think he does it in a very sly way where if you're  not very observant, you wouldn't even realize that he's being controlling. But just the way he was sitting in camp today like all sprawled out with his  back against the like recliner on the throne and everybody's just like  waiting on him. <br/>Parvati, can you give me the machete? <br/>Where is it? He's very demanding. He's like, "Oh, hand me that machete, hand me this bowl." You know,  "Serve me." I'm like no, that just doesn't I'm like no, that just  doesn't fly with me at all. fly with me at all. <br/>Yesterday I was cutting a coconut and they're like, "Nate, come over  here." I was like, "What?" Ow. Oh, it's a crab. [laughter] I'm like damn, this nut hurts. <br/>That's how I can get close to guys in the beginning is just flirting with  them. I mean, you just have to figure out the best way to infiltrate out the best  way to infiltrate the little groups. the little groups. <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah, guys are tight. But, you know, we're tight. But, you know, we're tight. You know that. You know that. You know that. You don't believe me? <br/>I believe you. <br/>I know you believe me. My feelings for Parvati are that she's a very cool girl. We click real good. She's smart, but I can definitely trust her. She's definitely like... she's She's definitely like... she's my ace right  now. my ace right now. I think there definitely could be some sparks in the future. But I don't want to find myself thinking like a dumb-dumb and just... you  know, just guys sometimes, we can't control ourselves. They trust me. <br/>By the guys, you mean J.P.? He's the one who's calling shots, he's the one who's making the decisions. <br/>Well, he is because he knows he has me and he knows he has the other guys. <br/>I just don't like that he is, like, completely in control right now. Or thinks he is. <br/>But that's how you let the game play-- let the king think he's all good and  sitting pretty. pretty. <br/>Is that your new motto? <br/>Is that your new motto? <br/>I do not want to upset J.P. right now. That would be the last person I would want on my bad side. So I'm just going to let the king sit pretty until something king sit pretty  until something happens. happens. <br/>Sitting in the nest, she's probably got eggs. <br/>Yeah, they got eggs. <br/>Let's go look at them. <br/>I don't know if she's protecting eggs or she just is tough. <br/>I think she's got eggs. The kid in me want to get some eggs for everybody. I don't need it but the kid in me want to climb the tree. The kid in me want to get up there and see if I can do it. there and see if I can do it. Give me a stick. Give me a stick. <br/>No eggs. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>What? <br/>Oh. Oh, wow! <br/>The little chick. <br/>Fell out? <br/>Oh, man. Just one? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Put it back in the nest. <br/>Thing can't fly. <br/>Oh, man. Can't put the nest back, you want to put the nest back? <br/>No. <br/>It wouldn't work, would it? <br/>This thing is newborn, like today. Just covered with its... with its stuff. I mean, it couldn't hold its head up. It had been born within 24 hours. And it's in my hand. I mean, I wanted to cry. I felt terrible. I don't know. <br/>We can't put the nest back up. <br/>We can try. <br/>Okay, I'm going to put it back for you. Sorry. I am really sorry, I mean it. Curiosity got the best of me, birdie. <br/>The nest is really fragile. <br/>Grab the tree branch. <br/>We're sorry, mother. <br/>Can you just put it on that branch? <br/>Yeah, that's where it was. <br/>He's okay. He's okay. Forgive us, please. <br/>Forgive us. I'm sorry. There, secure, okay. <br/>Nice. <br/>Good job. <br/>I'm sorry. That kid in me just keep wanting to do this and do that, without thinking. And getting in trouble. I should know better. Why am I doing the stupid things for? I feel really bad. I feel really bad. I'm really humbled. I'm really humbled. I'm really humbled. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. We'll now bring in Adam, returning from Exile Island. [applause]  Welcome home. <br/>Welcome home, brother. Good to see you. <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready for today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: First things first,  Probst: First things first, Jenny, I'll take back the idol. Jenny, I'll take back the idol. Once again, immunity back up for grabs. On my go, four tribe members will race to assemble a stretch of puzzle. You will then run through the jungle with the stretcher until you reach the  beach, where you will find another tribe member shackled at the top of a mast. One tribe member will make the long swim out, climb up a rope ladder, release  their tribe member. Both will then swim back to the beach holding on to a life ring. You will place the rescued tribemate on the stretcher, run back to the start  where the three remaining tribe members must now build a rescue fire. First tribe to build a fire big enough to burn through their rope, drop the  tribe flag wins immunity, guaranteed at least one more day in this game. Losers, tribal council, somebody going home tonight. Make sense? Rarotonga, you have one extra member, sitting somebody out. Cannot sit out the same person out in back-to-back challenges. Stephannie sat out last time. Who's it going to be today? Cristina, take a spot on the bench. bench. We'll get started. We'll get started.

Once again you worked well together and it paid off-- immunity. [cheers] Raro, not good news for you guys. Tribal council tonight. Somebody from this tribe is going home. Head on out. Head on out. See you at tribal. See you at tribal. <br/>Well, unfortunately since we lost our challenge today that means we're going  to tribal council tonight. And no one's looking forward to that. But it has to be. Someone has to go home tonight. <br/>Keep our heads up, guys. I don't want to see any frowns. <br/>Too bad we went up against a  Too bad we went up against a Zen fire master. Zen fire master. <br/>I feel like I'm the weakest link and I'm so angry with myself about that. Like I should have done better. I should have struck the flint harder, stronger, done something, you know, to  make more of a difference. <br/>Just so you know, when Cao Boi was on our team he was always the one making  the fire, starting the fire, tending to starting the fire, tending to the  fire. the fire. <br/>Look, guys, I'm the one that caused us to lose this challenge and I'm  probably the challenge and I'm probably the weakest link. weakest link. <br/>Steph just came out of the blue and said, "I'm the weakest link."  Stephannie and I are real tight. We got Hikihood love, you know? She's one of my Supremes, so she knows I have her back. But then I think about it, all these people are out here trying to play a  game and if someone is doubting themselves this early, and doesn't want to be  here, I'm and doesn't want to be here, I'm not going to keep you here. not going to keep you here. <br/>You know, rather than have it  You know, rather than have it be a surprise to her. be a surprise to her. <br/>Give her some respect. She's given us respect and She's given us respect and helped us out in many  ways. helped us out in many ways. <br/>Exactly. <br/>We give her the respect she gave us, you know what I'm gave us, you know what  I'm saying? saying? <br/>You want to go fetch  You want to go fetch coconuts? coconuts? <br/>I know it's important right now as a tribe to keep the strong ones in, that  we can win more challenges going forward, but then again, it's five women,  four men. So if we're going to do any type of alliance, it needs to be done right now,  tonight, if any of the women really want to stay in the game. I would love to see us girls align and take out some of the guys because the  guys are already starting to align together and stick together and they're  the stronger ones. <br/>So why don't we switch this up and just have all the girls align right now  and get rid of J.P. <br/>That's what I said. Women should stick together. <br/>All right, I'm cool with that. I'm not ready to go home. <br/>Girl, I'm not either. <br/>Girl, I'm not either. <br/>Uh-uh. <br/>Uh-uh. <br/>Right. I can't believe I set myself up like that. I just should have kept it to myself. It was just a moment of frustration. I'm not giving up. I don't want that perception hanging over my head. <br/>Hello. <br/>Hello. <br/>Hello. <br/>Hello. <br/>Hello. <br/>All right. <br/>All right. <br/>How? <br/>Us girls come together. Are you up for it? Are you up for it? <br/>I'd be up for it. <br/>I'd be up for it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Is she? <br/>Is she? <br/>I really don't trust him,  I really don't trust him, I don't. I don't. I don't. <br/>Honestly, I think...  Honestly, I think...  We need you guys. <br/>We need you guys. I need you. I need you. <br/>I don't completely trust Brad. I trust him to a certain degree. So whatever Brad chooses to do today, I hope it's for the good of our tribe  and not just for of our tribe and not just for himself. himself. <br/>Probst: Nate, how are you feeling in general in this game right now? <br/>You know, we've only been together three, four days. So we're all still feeling the waters. I'm not breaking out of my shell yet because it could bite me in the butt. If you become too powerful, too assertive in the beginning, the rest of them  will just eat you up. <br/>Probst: Jenny, is there a leader on this tribe? <br/>Not-- not really. <br/>Probst: And what does that mean, "No, not really?" as if there was  something underneath that. <br/>You're putting me on the spot, aren't you? <br/>Probst: It's tribal council, it's a game for a million dollars. I'm trying to figure out what's going on. <br/>All right, J.P., don't hate me, but J.P. likes to take command a lot. <br/>Probst: So J.P., when Jenny says "Sorry, don't be mad at me..."  I have no problem with her saying that whatsoever. I mean, I don't say, "Hey, you got to go fish, you got to..."  Matter of fact, there's times I go, "I'm taking a nap." You know,  so, maybe I voice a couple more things, maybe we should do things. But I don't tell anybody how or when. <br/>Probst: Rebecca, why was it you, Jenny and Steph that were deemed the fire  makers for this challenge? <br/>Because we were all really confident going in, in terms of making fire. We've all started fires on a daily basis. And unfortunately, I just couldn't get the right spark. <br/>Probst: Stephannie, would it be fair to vote one of the three of you off  tonight simply because you didn't get it done? <br/>I would say no, it wouldn't be fair. It could have been any one of us up there trying to make that fire. But that's not what you want to consider. If you're going to vote someone off, you should consider the big picture. <br/>Probst: J.P., while Stephannie was talking, you were nodding completely in  agreement. <br/>Yeah, I mean, okay, I'll put myself out there-- I got my butt kicked on the  swimming today. There was no reason for them to vote me off today. So I agree with Stephannie 100%, it doesn't go according to the challenge. It's not fair. <br/>Probst: Brad, is it too early to ask if there is a philosophy that you bring  to how you play this game? <br/>Trust is a foundation of everything. For me at this point in time, I always like to use the term "go with  your gut," and 95% of the time my gut's always right. <br/>Probst: Parvati, do you trust everybody in this tribe at this point? <br/>For the most part, I do trust everyone in this tribe. <br/>Probst: How about you, Stephannie? <br/>No, I don't trust everyone in the tribe. But I do feel comfortable enough to share certain things with all of our  tribe members, yes. So there is a certain level of trust that I have. But to completely trust? This is a game, and I can never do that. <br/>Probst: Rebecca, when you go back to camp tonight, will you be able to let  this vote go easily? <br/>It won't be easy but it's something that has to be done so that we can all  move on and move forward and get stronger so that we don't have to come back  here again. <br/>Probst: J.P., you're shaking your head. You're dreading this? <br/>Yeah, I've already told myself this will probably be my hardest vote in this  game. <br/>Probst: Okay, now that Exile Island has come into play, the hidden immunity  idol could come up. If it gets played, you present it to me after the vote. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Stephannie, you're up. Stephannie, you're up. <br/>Sorry, J.P. It was either you or me. <br/>I wish you didn't voice that point of weakness, but you are a wonderful and  beautiful person and you'll be with me person and you'll be with me the rest  of this game. the rest of this game. <br/>J.P., I know you had your game face on and none of us wanted to be played. wanted to be played. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck. <br/>Your wish is my command. <br/>Your wish is my command. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Stephannie. First vote, Stephannie.

Unless you have the hidden immunity idol, you need to bring me your torch. <br/>Holy crap. Damn, you guys outwitted me big Damn, you guys outwitted me big time. time. <br/>Probst: J.P., the tribe has  Probst: J.P., the tribe has spoken. spoken. <br/>Probst: Well, you just voted out someone who appeared to be one of the strongest  members of this tribe. He obviously did not see it coming. I'm hoping this means you have a plan on how to get this tribe better  together to start winning some challenges. Grab your torches, go back to Grab your torches, go back to camp, good night. camp, good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:  Today's a good day to be just relaxing. <br/>Probst: Cao Boi fumes  Probst: Cao Boi fumes over the women's work ethic. over the women's work ethic. <br/>Sundra, Candice, Becky they don't even try.

It takes more than just being strong and big and physical and thinking you're  mentally tough. You got to really watch your back. There's no hard feelings, that's the way the game is played, and man, they  really pulled one over on me. You definitely can't trust anybody in this game, there's anybody in this  game, there's no way.
