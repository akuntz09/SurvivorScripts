<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: The two tribes paddled to Exile Island  and merged into one. <br/>"Drop your old buffs and wear these new ones as you paddle to your home,  the old Moto camp."  I'll probably get a turn at the bed tonight. Finally, things are looking up. <br/>Probst: When they returned to Moto's beach of luxury...  What the hell? <br/>Probst: ...everything was gone. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Oh, no. This is like a bad dream. <br/>No bed, no couch, no shelter, no nothing. <br/>Probst: The new merged tribe contained two alliances-- the Four Horsemen of  Alex, Edgardo, Mookie, and the not-so-reliable Dreamz...  Unless I'm mistaken, the four of us are controlling this game right now. <br/>Probst: ...and a separate alliance of four. <br/>There's a tribe within the tribe-- myself, Michelle, Cassandra and Yau. <br/>Probst: Leaving Stacy and Boo  Probst: Leaving Stacy and Boo on the outs. on the outs. Mookie finally told Dreamz about finding the hidden immunity idol at the old  Ravu camp. <br/>But you can't say a word. <br/>Do I look like... shut up! We had a pact, and it kind of made me not trust them a little bit, and made  me feel I'm on the outskirts. So I'm going to trust them until So I'm going to trust them until I can't  trust them no more. I can't trust them no more. <br/>Probst: And the Four Horsemen's alliance began to fall apart. <br/>They just want Stacy on their side to take one of us out. <br/>No way, no. Point blank, no. <br/>Probst: In order to protect themselves, Mookie and Dreamz decided to go  against the Four Horsemen and target Stacy. <br/>I'll really looking forward to voting off Stacy. She's got to go. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge... Reveal. If you have orange go to the orange mat. If you have green, go to the green mat. A twist temporarily split the tribe into two random teams. Yau-Man working quickly. The orange team is heading out. And Yau Man proved himself a valuable asset. Yau-man makes a last-minute switch, and it's a good thing he did. Orange team wins immunity and reward! Michelle, Stacy, Alex, Mookie, Dreamz, you will not be going back to camp. We're heading to tribal council right now. At tribal council... Ninth person voted out and the third member of our jury...  Dreamz waffled and betrayed Mookie when he voted for Michelle instead of  Stacy. Michelle, the tribe has spoken. Nine are left. Nine are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Guaranteed, I think, Michelle or Stacy are gone. <br/>Who is Dreamz more tight with? <br/>I don't know, because he  I don't know, because he doesn't like Stacy at all. doesn't like Stacy at all. doesn't like Stacy at all. <br/>Welcome home. <br/>Welcome home. <br/>Voting suck? <br/>Voting suck? <br/>Yeah, it sucked. <br/>Yeah, it sucked. <br/>I guess you could say I'm pretty upset right now. Earlier on, Dreamz and I had a conversation of exactly going back to the  original plan that we had, that we would take out Stacy. But Dreamz still votes off Michelle. We just basically gave all the power to Alex. You know, we just basically screwed ourselves. <br/>I made it very clear I that was voting for Michelle. I thought you were, like, doing your own thing. I was like...  No. <br/>Okay, that's fine. It's just miscommunication. But listen, the way to seal the final four in blood is to take the immunity  idol and rotate it. Each of us gets it a day, and that way...  That does nothing. <br/>It does, dude. It does. <br/>It doesn't do anything. <br/>It does. It does, Mookie. Because what it tells me and tells everybody is that none of us can screw  each other over. If I... look, the three of us found it together. You started digging in one area, I pointed to another area. We were all digging. You happened to be the first one to touch it. And now you're telling me you're not going to part with it unless only on  your terms. That's messed up, dude. <br/>I'm not saying that. <br/>That's exactly what you're saying. You're saying something different? Be honest, man. <br/>You know what? What's going to happen now is Alex is like, "You know what? You have to trust us, and we're each going to share the immunity idol. We're going to hold it once We're going to hold it once every day."  every day." Then he's like, "Four Horsemen is nothing." No we  can't. No we don't, because they don't trust us. This is what just... you screwed everything with that. <br/>When we got to tribal council, Michelle start talking. And when she says in the tribal council, "I don't know Dre, I never hung  around him," it kind of let me know, "Wait a minute, I don't know  her neither. I don't know what alliance she's in." So it kind of scared me a little  bit, so it caused me to vote her name. If she never said that, she'd still be here right now. <br/>You did, trust me. Don't worry about it. Trust me. Trust me. You just screwed both of us. You just screwed both of us. <br/>Well, the tribe, the other half returned from tribal council, and I was  hoping that Stacy was gone. It was definitely a shock. I was very disappointed, and that just flipped the whole script around for  everything in my head. <br/>If you all want to take me in as a swing vote we'll make it to the five with  me, you, Cassandra, Yau-- because I know you're tight with Yau, Yau's a  solid, solid, person-- and Dreamz. The rest of them, they're all backstabbers. <br/>I think ... I mean, as long as we take out Alex first. <br/>That's fine with me, but the thing is Dreamz is not going to want to take  Alex out. <br/>You think Dreamz is not going to want to take Alex out? <br/>He likes Alex. <br/>When Boo and I had our man[1]to-man  talk and looked each other in the eye and said he was with me, I still didn't  buy it. Boo is just trying to save his own neck at all times. But I need to know if he's with us. I mean, because we really need his vote since we don't have Michelle. That should go a few hours. Basically, the main core is myself, Yau, and Cassandra. I trust them completely. Dreamz is definitely a wild card and I don't know if I trust Mookie all the  way yet, because he's already kind of... tries to manipulate a lot as well. It's that part of the chess game where you've already lost a couple of really  good pieces, and now you have to really think. You can't trust everybody. But I like playing this game. But I like playing this game. And I am still here. And I am still here. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, we're going to test how in tune are you with  the rest of your tribe. I have a series of questions. Each of you are going to answer these questions in private. I'll tally the results, then I'll explain the challenge. I'll explain the challenge. Let's go. Let's go. Okay, I have tallied the results. Now I'm going ask you these same questions again, only this time you're  trying to guess what the group said-- in other words, whose name came up the  most often. That may differ from what you wrote down. You're looking to match the group consensus. Each time you get it right, you get to smash another tribe member's tower. When your three towers are gone, you're out of the challenge. The last person left standing wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? The winner of this challenge will spend the night on a 70-foot luxury yacht. <br/>Whoo! All right! <br/>Probst: You'll have a snack and cocktail when you get on board, a nice  barbecue. You'll spend the night on the yacht in a comfortable bed. In addition, the winner of this challenge will send one person to Exile  Island. Worth playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: We'll get started. <br/>Probst: We'll get started. All right, so remember, you're looking to match the consensus as a group  whose name came up the most often. First question-- who would you trust with your life? Reveal. The answer most commonly given by the group was Earl. Yau-Man got it right. Cassandra got it right. And Boo got it right. Cassandra drew the strike first. You're up. <br/>Just random, anybody? <br/>Probst: It's not random. Your reason, your choice. You're giving somebody their first blow in this game. With force, Cassandra gives Stacy her first knock. Boo is not wasting any time. Knocks out Stacy's second tower. Yau-Man, you're up. Just like that, Stacy is out of this challenge. Have a seat on the bench. Next question-- who are you least likely to invite to a least likely to  invite to a family dinner? family dinner? Everybody reveal. Correct answer-- Boo. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: Cassandra got it right, Mookie got it right, Dreamz got it right, and  Alex got it right. got it right. Mookie, you're up. Mookie, you're up. Mookie, you're up. Will we have a repeat? Will we have a repeat? Will we have a second person Will we have a second person knocked out? knocked out? Boo is out of the challenge. Once again Cassandra gets to hit. And knocks out Alex's first tower. Next question-- who most has a sense of entitlement? Everybody reveal. The group felt Alex. Cassandra got it right. Mookie got it right. Cassandra, you're up. Cassandra going right back to Alex. Alex now down to his last tower. Mookie smashes Earl's first tower. Next question-- who would you most like to be stranded on an island with? Whose name came up the most often? Everybody reveal. The correct answer is Yau-Man. Everybody got it right except Alex. There is going to be some damage done in this round. Earl, you're up first. Earl nonchalant. Payback has begun. Mookie back to Earl. Dreamz heads to Alex. Alex is out of this challenge. Edgardo gives Earl a little what's up and takes him out of the challenge. Yau-Man heads to Edgardo. Cassandra knocks Mookie's second tower out. Okay, Earl and Alex are out of the challenge. Take a seat on the bench. Who do you not want to see again after the game? Everybody reveal. Everybody said Stacy. Correct answer was Stacy. Dreamz surveying the field. Who's going to get his love? Edgardo heading directly to Yau-Man's towers. Yau-Man getting even with Dreamz. Mookie going to pay Cassandra back for her last hit. Cassandra takes Mookie out of the game. Next question-- who smells the worst? Out of all the people left in this game, who smells the worst? Everybody reveal. Edgardo thinks he smells the worse. Yau-Man thinks Stacy smells the worst. Cassandra and Dreamz think Dreamz smells the worst. Dreamz is nodding. He knows. It is Dreamz. Cassandra got it right. And Dreamz got it right. Cassandra knocks Yau-Man out of the game. Just like that, Edgardo down to his last tower. Next question-- who mistakenly believes they are in control of this game? Everybody reveal. The group felt Alex was the person who mistakenly believed they were in  control of this game. Cassandra is right. Make your move. Edgardo's out of the game. He takes a spot on the bench. We are down to two. Both have two towers left. Who has wasted this great Who has wasted this great opportunity? opportunity? Everybody reveal. Correct answer is Stacy. Cassandra got it right. Cassandra got it right. Make your move. Make your move. Cassandra knocks Dreamz's whole name off the board. <br/>Not so hard. <br/>Probst: Dreamz down to his last tower. Cassandra get this right, she wins the challenge. Athletically, who out here has surprised you the most in terms of their  athleticism? Reveal. Dreamz says Cassandra. Dreamz is wrong. Cassandra says Yau-Man. Cassandra is right. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Take your last hit. And with that, Cassandra wins this challenge. Not one question wrong. Nice job. First order of business will not be fun. You're sending one person to Exile Island. They will stay there until the next immunity challenge. Who are you going send off? <br/>Mookie. <br/>Probst: Mookie, going back to Exile Island. The boat will pick you up. The boat will pick you up. Head on down to the water. Head on down to the water. All right, next part of this reward's a little more fun. Here is your boarding pass to your yacht. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: We'll pick you up at camp. You'll return to camp in the morning, refreshed, some good food in your belly. Here are three more boarding passes. You are going to decide which three people join you on this reward, and  you're going to do it when you get back to your camp. <br/>Okay. <br/>I'll lick your feet, man. <br/>Probst: Some negotiating to be had. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Probst: All right, guys, grab your stuff. your stuff. Head on back to camp. Head on back to camp. <br/>I am very irritated with Cassandra. She just sent me to Exile She just sent me to Exile Island. Island. Cassandra is quiet, but in a deceiving, conniving way. She just made the worst mistake She just made the worst mistake of her life. of her life. Given the clues, there has to be two idols. The Moto tribe members get the same exact clues as the Ravu members. I mean, if you couldn't find this on the third clue, you must be stupid. Worthless. Earl came to Exile Island about five, six times. Most likely Earl found the other one. I'm 99% sure that Earl has the immunity idol. Smart guy. All I want to do is take out Cassandra and her alliance, period. Call it revenge, but I'm gunning for her. I just have to get in touch with the Four Horsemen, and it's the Four  Horsemen, and it's done. done. <br/>Cassandra back in high school. The most popular girl again. <br/>I just won my first reward, first time on a yacht, and I had a chance to take  three people. a chance to take three people. Dreamz you may as well come up. Dreamz you may as well come up. <br/>What number? <br/>Boo, come on up. <br/>Oh, yes! <br/>Basically my strategy was to choose people that I needed to form an alliance  with. Dreamz and Boo, I wasn't sure where they stood. Of course, it just gets tougher as I narrow it down. Oh, god. This is hard. Wow. I mean, Yau-Man, would you join me? <br/>Thank you. <br/>And then the last one was Yau-Man. I just think Yau-Man works so hard, and he needed a break. <br/>De plane! <br/>Hey, let's go, y'all. They're honking for us. <br/>De plane! <br/>De plane! De plane! De plane! <br/>Oh, yeah! <br/>Welcome on board. <br/>Well, thank you very much. The first thing I saw on the yacht was cheese and crackers and olives, just  an amazing spread. That's when it really started hitting me-- I just won. Boo, you want a margarita? <br/>Yeah, I want a margarita! <br/>I felt like "Welcome to the lifestyle of the rich and famous."  Champagne for you two. I'll pass them over. <br/>Cling-cling, cling-cling. <br/>Boo, you're solidly with us. <br/>Man, I am solidly...  Part of our syndicate. And, Dreamz, the syndicate. <br/>From day one. <br/>Let's not make any more mistakes. Let's proceed carefully. We'll go all the way. <br/>It was hardball yesterday. I was like, "Ooh!"  There's a lot of work to be done on Dreamz, a little bit more, so we can be  absolutely sure we have him on our side. And this is a way for to us to solidify it-- feed him, get him away from  everybody. away from everybody. Just brainwash him, basically. Just brainwash him, basically. Cheers. <br/>Cheers. <br/>So we're all straight with our alliance? <br/>Uh-huh. Without a doubt. <br/>The next one to go is Alex. <br/>Uh-huh. He's playing a Harvard graduate game. He's playing hardball. I think Dreamz is playing both sides right now, because I can't sense in his  eyes 100% commitment to our alliance, so I don't know what the future is  don't know what the future is going to be for us with Dreamz. going to be for us with Dreamz. <br/>Firecrackers, Joe. <br/>I'm the swing vote that's stuck between the two alliances. Mookie' plan was to stick with the old plan and go with the four boys and  Stacy. But my heart telling me go with Cassandra, Earl, and Yau-Man and Boo. So it's like, so much information going on that it's clogging my mind, and I  don't know what to do right now. It's like I'm being tugged in It's like I'm being tugged in every direction  except my own. every direction except my own. <br/>Alex, man, they're going to use your name. They'll probably put your name in the pot tomorrow. Your name is going to come up tomorrow. Man, we messed up. <br/>That's the thing. What about Mookie? If Mookie don't give you the idol... You haven't seen Lord of the  Rings?" When they get the ring, like, "My precious..."  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Gollum. <br/>Yeah. He's getting like that. <br/>I understand. But I don't want to get knocked out. <br/>Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. I don't want you to get knocked out. <br/>Can we get the pot? We need the pot. <br/>Oh, you guys need the pot? <br/>You guys are gone forever, and we don't have that much wood. There is a major part of me that wants to let Dreamz go. You know, right now I'm trying to keep it personal between us, but if you  keep on fraternizing with the people that, you know, we're talking about  getting rid of, then, you know, you're going to have to get cut. <br/>Who's going? <br/>You know...  No, just say it. <br/>Earl, I mean, he was... he's not doubting you. <br/>It hurt my feelings when you just said that. <br/>No. <br/>Come here, Earl. <br/>No, let me talk to you. <br/>Let me talk to you. Cassandra told me that you're...  I said we're not sure what camp you're in and we need to know that you're  firm on our side. <br/>You know I heard what y'all were saying, right? You know I was standing there. <br/>Yeah, yeah. That's the whole thing. What did we say? Earl, I can tell by the way you're looking at me that you're doubting me. <br/>This is one thing you need to start doing a little bit more. <br/>You don't see the show enough. You don't see the show enough to strategize, because I can tell you ain't  strategizing. <br/>I'm someone you need to listen to more, because I notice that you talk over  us. Now, we have agreed on this. <br/>Mookie's got the immunity idol. Yes, Mookie has found the immunity idol. Mookie's got the idol. <br/>He told you he had it? <br/>I seen the idol. <br/>What did it look like? <br/>It's a turtle. <br/>It's a turtle? <br/>It's a little turtle necklace. <br/>A turtle necklace? <br/>Yeah. <br/>So he has the idol? <br/>He has the idol. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Why are you just now telling me this about this idol? I didn't even know anybody had it from over there. I should have been knowing that. <br/>Mookie's got it. <br/>Dreamz, his problem is he's trying to do a lot of strategy on his own, and,  yes, it can be effective, but if you don't tell people what you're doing, I'm  sorry, I'm just not going to trust anybody, especially someone that, you  know, has all these little antics and things about them that, you know, I  still kind of question anyway. <br/>Homebody keep asking Mookie about the idol. <br/>He told everybody he has the idol? <br/>Yeah, him and Alex got the idol. <br/>They found it together? <br/>Yes. <br/>They didn't fight over it? <br/>No. <br/>There are two hidden immunity idols. The one over here in the Moto camp was dug up by me. Dreamz revealed that Mookie actually have the immunity idol from Ravu island. The fact that Mookie have it made me very nervous, and not only that, the  other two crucial members, Edgardo and Alex, also know he has it. I have to rethink how this will I have to rethink how this will play out. play out. play out. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Mookie, We'll now bring in Mookie, returning from Exile  Island. returning from Exile Island. You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: First things first. Give it up. Tribal immunity is no more. Individual immunity is what you covet. You have this around your neck, you cannot be voted out. Shall we get to the challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge you are going to use your arms to brace between  two walls while your feet are positioned on very narrow footholds. Every 30 minutes, you'll step down to an even smaller foothold, making it  more difficult. When you reach the third and final foothold, you will stay there for as long  as you can. When you fall off, you're out. Big rules-- no hips, no back, no butt. Arms and feet only. Last person left standing wins immunity. Losers go to tribal council. Somebody will be going home. Take your spots. Take your spots. We'll get started. We'll get started. This challenge is officially This challenge is officially underway. underway. Day 27, another hot one. Day 27, another hot one. Not a bit of breeze out here. Not a bit of breeze out here. Edgardo looks like he could go all day. Mookie looks like he might be Mookie looks like he might be asleep he's so  comfortable. asleep he's so comfortable. <br/>Ouch! <br/>Probst: Cassandra steps down. She's the first person out of the challenge. the challenge. Take a spot on the bench. Take a spot on the bench. [ drumming]  Meke! <br/>Meke! Voodoo. Voodoo. <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Probst: Out of nowhere, Edgardo slips off. And then there were seven. The foothold you're standing on now, less than an inch wide. By the time you get to the bottom, less than a quarter inch. Okay, you've been up there 30 minutes. It is time to move down one foothold. Everybody move. You are now sitting on a foothold less than a half an inch wide. Mookie looks like a fixed piece of art. Mookie slips off, but recovers. Earl...  Slipped. <br/>Probst: ...slipped. Earl is the third person out of this challenge. Who is the odds-on favorite now, Who is the odds-on favorite now, Earl? Earl? <br/>Stacy. <br/>Probst: Cassandra? <br/>Stacy. <br/>Probst: Edgardo? <br/>What I would say right now by  What I would say right now by looking at everybody, Stacy. looking at everybody, Stacy. <br/>Probst: Mookie the fourth  Probst: Mookie the fourth person out of this challenge. person out of this challenge.

Alex drops out. We are now down to Boo, Dreamz, Stacy, and Yau Man. Dreamz is out of the challenge. And we are now down to three And we are now down to three people left. people left. <br/>Probst: After an hour and 15 minutes, Stacy is out of the challenge. <br/>Ooh-wee! <br/>Probst: Boo with a very nice recovery. Boo almost loses it, and saves himself again. <br/>How many lives does that guy have? <br/>Probst: Boo slipping again  Probst: Boo slipping again and hanging in there. and hanging in there. Boo struggling to recover. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Yau-Man wins first individual immunity. <br/>I'm sure I could stay another hour. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man, come on  Probst: Yau-Man, come on over. over. Congratulations. Yau-Man, safe tonight at the vote. One of you is going home tonight. Grab your stuff, head back to Grab your stuff, head back to camp. camp. <br/>All right, it will bring good  All right, it will bring good luck to everybody. luck to everybody. <br/>By Cassandra sending me to Exile Island she ruined the game for herself and  her alliance. I am going to take out her whole I am going to take out her whole alliance  one by one. alliance one by one. Knowing that Earl potentially has the idol does change the game a little bit  in terms of strategy. You want to get the guy with the immunity idol, and get him by surprise. And hopefully we can take him out, and take him out with the immunity idol,  and he won't use it. <br/>Hey, look-- I trust you guys. You're my best bet. <br/>When I was on Exile Island I committed myself to that. I'm like, "I will not be faltered. I will not be wavered by anybody." This is the order that we're sticking  with-- Earl, Yau Man, Boo. It's done. <br/>It's done. <br/>It's done. <br/>Are you 100% on Stacy? <br/>Stacy is with us. She's with us. She's with us. <br/>Are you sure? <br/>Are you sure? <br/>It's so weird. We're going go to tribal council, and I have no idea what's going on. what's going on. I have no idea. I have no idea. <br/>But it makes no point if I'm the only person that's voting the only person  that's voting for Alex. for Alex. Okay, as long as I have that assurance. Then I'll do that to save myself Then I'll do that to save myself then. then. then. Are you in? Are you in? <br/>I, of course, want to go with the majority. So it's who do I trust more at this point in the game? I don't owe anything to Alex. If saving myself means severing If saving myself means severing a tie, then  I'll sever that tie. a tie, then I'll sever that tie. <br/>That means she's not in, dude. dude. No. No. <br/>What do you think? I think not. <br/>I think... I don't know. <br/>I think... I don't know. I think not. I think not. I think not. <br/>Pretty much. <br/>Pretty much. <br/>You think Mookie is going to  You think Mookie is going to do that? do that? <br/>That's the thing. <br/>That's the thing. If Stacy comes through today... If Stacy comes through today...  Os to show the immunity idol. <br/>Show the immunity idol. All right, well, have that in line, and have that thing ready line, and have  that thing ready just in case. just in case. <br/>My hope was that Stacy would vote with us today to make it 5-3, but it seems  like she's not voting with us anymore. I don't want to use the immunity idol this early in the game. But at the same time, I have to strategically think about what's going to get  me the furthest in this game. I can save Alex by giving him the immunity idol, but this early in the game  to use the immunity idol is kind of a disadvantage. So things have gotten very complicated. complicated. <br/>Mook, Mook, Mook, Mook. <br/>Mook, Mook, Mook, Mook. <br/>Turns out that Mookie gave the idol to Alex, so we're going to vote Mookie  just to catch to vote Mookie just to catch them off guard. them off guard. <br/>Dreamz, Alex, Mookie and I are voting for Cassandra. I think that's the smartest move. And also, it will be like... you know, have the hardest punch at tribal  council. This is an all-or-nothing move. But if it works out, it will probably be one of the best probably be one of  the best moves ever. moves ever. <br/>I think we should talk about it between the five of us. Look, we should do... look, we should do the five of us for Edgardo, and not  say anything to anybody else. anybody else. That's it. That's it. <br/>What's going on now is total chaos. A lot of people are paranoid. The panic button has been pushed. Mookie had the idol. He actually gave it to Alex. So that was from our source, which is Dreamz, but it could be a test. It doesn't matter, because we're smarter than that, so we won't vote Alex or  Mookie. We're going to vote Edgardo. We're going to vote Edgardo. <br/>Alex, Alex. <br/>Alex, Alex. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in  Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. the members of our jury. Rocky, Lisi, and Michelle, voted Rocky, Lisi, and Michelle, voted out at the  last tribal council. out at the last tribal council. Okay, Dreamz, was there a mad scramble when you got back after the challenge  today? <br/>Jeff, if you was on that beach, it was chaotic. The most chaotic day of any time-- swing pitchers, swing voters, swing  hitters. And I'm talking on behalf of everybody. It's the most chaotic day ever. <br/>I mean, seriously, right now, I don't even know who the majority is. I'm lost. I'm, like, paranoid. I've been paranoid ever since... I mean, I'm paranoid right now. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man, the one guy who doesn't have to be paranoid tonight is you. <br/>This is the first time I've come to a tribal council meeting with a regular  heart rate and normal blood pressure. And that's a good thing for an old man. <br/>Probst: Mookie, so you're gone two days, and you come back to the most  chaotic day out here. <br/>Like Edgardo said, tons of different names coming up. I'm thinking I'm one of the people, since I was at Exile. I don't know what's going on, either. But I guess I have to use my own judgment. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man, the way the idol plays this season is a little different. How does that impact how you vote? <br/>If we suspect someone has the idol, we should try to avoid voting for that  person and vote somebody in his alliance out first. There's two ways to defeat an army. One is to cut off the head. The other is to take away all the soldiers. <br/>Probst: Alex, how much time do you spend thinking about the idol in terms of  your strategy? <br/>Logically speaking, I'm going to suspect that the people who have been to  Exile Island, like Earl, are probably going to have it. So that tells me either avoid Earl or try to take out people in an Earl's  alliance. <br/>Probst: Dreamz, how crazy is this vote going to be tonight? <br/>This vote right here is going to determine everything in the game. It's going to separate the snakes and rats right here. <br/>Probst: All right, let's get to the vote. First thing, if somebody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play  it, you would present it to me after we voted, but before I read the votes. Yau-Man, you have individual immunity. You can, of course, give that to somebody if you want to, or you can hang on  to it. <br/>I'll hang on to it for tonight. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man is safe. You cannot vote for Yau-Man tonight. Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote. It's time to vote. Alex, you're up. Alex, you're up. <br/>A strategic move. <br/>A strategic move. Let's still be friends.

Okay, if anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now is  the time to do play it, now is the time to do so. so. Alex is playing the hidden immunity idol.

The idol will be rehidden. New clues will be put out on Exile Island. The chaos of tonight's tribal council is a great reminder that this game is  always in a state of flux-- something to keep in the back of your head as you  head into the home stretch of this game. Grab your torches, head back to Grab your torches, head back to camp, good  night. camp, good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor... Dreamz has some explaining to do. <br/>Dude, you turned on us. <br/>No, I didn't turn on you all. <br/>How do you figure? <br/>Probst: Alex and Mookie discover that Yau-Man has the other hidden immunity  idol. <br/>He has it. <br/>Probst: And a new plan is born. <br/>It's going to feel so great. <br/>It's going to feel so great. That's going to feel so... That's going to feel so...  I'm a little bit disappointed that Dreamz messed me up in that vote. My plan was an all or nothing, and it didn't work out. But I tried my best, and to the guys that voted me off, best of luck. There's a couple of people that don't deserve the million dollars, but there  are a couple that do, and Cassandra, hopefully you will get voted off next  because I don't like you next because I don't like you very much.
