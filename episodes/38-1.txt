<br/> Jeff: These 14 strangers are about to begin an adventure  that will forever change their lives. <br/>You look at me, you think this is some new yorker. He's a military guy. But I'm currently in law school. <br/>And definitely don't want anybody to know I'm going to be  a lawyer because the wRong first impression could make or break my entire  game. <br/>I'm a super, megaultrafan of the show. You don't know when this is going to happen, when this is going  to flip, and this is going to happen, and that's my life. <br/>Jeff: They'll compete alongside four returning players: David,  Aubry, Wentworth, and Joe. Their vast "Survivor" experience could make them a  desired ally or an easy early vote. <br/>I think that I'm going to have a target on my back, but  I'm going to try my hardest to never shine brighter than everybody else. <br/>Jeff: And there's a secret, game-changing twist. After being voted out, players will be faced with a decision: Go  home or go to the Edge of Extinction, where they'll be pushed further than  ever before for a chance to get back in the game. In the end, only one will remain to claim the million-dollar  prize. 39 days, 18 people, one Survivor. Welcome to the 38th season of "Survivor." [ cheers and  applause ] here's a sobering thought-- in less than 72 hours, the first  person will be voted out. That's how fast this game moves. And every season it gets a little more complicated, a little  more difficult to win. No matter how good you are, you are always hovering on the edge  of being voted out. Just think of the history of great "Survivor" players  who have yet to win. In fact, let's just invite four of them to join you this season. [ applause ] bring them in! <br/>Woooo! <br/>Oh, my God, that Kelley Wentworth? <br/>My two favorites players are Kelley Wentworth and my total  "Survivor" crush is Joe. And so we see this boat coming and then you see the blond. And I'm like that's freaking Kelley Wentworth. And it gets closer and I'm like, "Is that Joe,  too?"  Oh, my God. <br/>David. <br/>Aubry. <br/>I hate that you brought people I like. <br/>Jeff: Come on up. This is who you're going to be playing with: Wentworth, davi David,. <br/>High, guys. <br/>Man bun! <br/>Jeff: Joe. And Aubry. <br/>Oh, my God. Welcome back. <br/>Jeff: All right, let's review the track record of these  four returning players. Kelley Wentworth-- first woman to find two hidden immunity  idols, and when she found herself in a deep hole, she used one of them for a  record-setting blindside. David writing-- scared of pretty much everything--  You don't need to relive all that. <br/>Jeff: On day one, but he didn't give up on himself. And he turned into a dominant strategic force. Joe has played most of his "Survivor" days with a  massive target on his back. Despite that target, Joe's tribes have won 16 challenges. And Aubry, literally cried in the shelter. [ laughter ] the first time she played, but she overcame her  insecurities and lasted 76 out of the possible 78 days she played. Four very different styles of play, four very good players. None of them won. Because "Survivor" is unpredictable. And that's why it's so great. And that's why you are here. You chose this adventure. And when "Survivor" pushes you further than you ever  imagined, that is your opportunity to stand up, adapt, and conquer. And that is the theme we're going to be exploring this season. This is "Survivor: Edge of Extinction." [ applause ] Kelley,  David, you're on the Manu tribe wearing blue. Say hello to your tribe mates. Join jur yur tribe and pass out your buffs. <br/>I'm Lauren. <br/>Nice to meet you. <br/>Jeff: Joe and Aubry, you are on the Kama tribe. Say hello to your tribemates. All right, let's kick it up to the next level. <br/>Oooh. <br/>Jeff: This boat is loaded with supplies. Some offer long-term help. Some are perishable. You have two minutes to get anything off of this boat into your  boat. Your "Survivor" adventure begins now. Go! This is it, all that energy finally coming out. <br/>Whoa, whoa, whoa! <br/>Hey, need some help! Need some help! <br/>Jeff: There goes Reem, our first person is over. <br/>Watch out! <br/>Jeff: Now everybody going over! <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Jeff: They're everywhere right now, all over the place,  very little communication, everybody just grabbing whatever they can and try  to get overboard. Now the job becomes try to get what you got overboard into your  boat. Keith working hard to get to that boat. Dig in, Keith! <br/>I'm not the best swimmer out here, and I've never been in  open water. Naturally me, who can't swim, will cost me to be the first one  gone, in this game, if you're on the outs, you're out. <br/>Jeff: David and Wentworth getting in the water. The last two. Right now, Kama seems to have the early advantage with what they  have in their boat. <br/>Got it. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Wooo! <br/>Jeff: All right, start paddling out! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: You've got what you got. "Survivor: Edge of Extinction" is on! [ applause ]  We've got to go right. <br/>Great work! [ applause ]  Great. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Straight up there. <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>We got some great stuff. <br/>Well, let's go look at our camp. <br/>Chris, man. <br/>Rick, dude. <br/>Good to meet you. <br/>As everyone's introducing themselves, I'm so overwhelmed  by the fact that I'm in this game. I'm still so excited because I'm a huge fan of the show. I've watched it since the very first episode. I'm a morning news anchor. <br/>Are you really? <br/>Yeah. And get this-- in the 115th we're 130. So pretty good. <br/>No one thinks news anchors are tough. I've got dad bod out here but I have a lot of belief in myself. I want to break through the wall-- oh, yeah! <br/>Appreciate it. <br/>Oh, my God! Are you okay? <br/>I'm fine. Just extremely clumsy. You'll see this several times. <br/>So much food. It's crazy. <br/>What is he doing? <br/>I don't trust anyone. <br/>Playing a third time, I know I may have a target on my back  initially, so getting an initial alliance in the beginning is very important. <br/>How are you? <br/>I'm good, how are you! <br/>How are you doing? <br/>Good. <br/>I played from the bottom in "Second chance."  that's not a good feeling. So this time I want to have genuine relationships which can be  hard for me because I'm a closed off person. <br/>I played soccer in college. <br/>I played soccer in holly, not college, but it's amazing. I have to be more open. I have to get to know these people on a human level. <br/>So who knows what they're doing? <br/>We were gog ask David, because, ideally, we want to have  two trees, kind of. <br/>We're waiting on your expertise here,. <br/>Oh, really? The first time I played "Survivor," I was afraid to,  like, voice an opinion. Chopping the wood, like the sound of that, like, rattled me. I had to plug my ears with my fingers. And it's, like, I was worried that my tribemates were going to  have that perception of me. This time, people are coming to me, these newbies with like,  what do you think? What should we do?" and I'm like, I'm trying to give them  ideas. <br/>Which way were you thinking, going in this direction? <br/>Seems like, yeah, right. I want people to feel I can help them navigate, especially the  very early part of this game so that they know I'm a friend. You can trust me, keep me around. <br/>So you open up this little guy here. <br/>Okay. <br/>And then it's just over and under. So you go under, then over. <br/>Do you do that all the time? <br/>I have mild turret's. <br/>Does that mean if you curse one of us out. <br/>So, like the popular version of toweret's is like a...  Thing like that. I don't have the vocalized version of it. I have motor ticks-- I have vocal tips. I have tourette's with a touch of o.C.D. A touch of co-co-combo. If I do and this do this and this arm one, it's a whole bunch  mixed in. It has to be all of them. And I feel like right now they're kind of good. But if I get really excited or I get really concentrated into  something or fitalk about them, they act up a lot. Yeah so one of them is that little bird noise. <br/>Wow, that's impressive. <br/>I'm kind of like an open book in a way. I'm not going to be, "Hey,en, I have tourette's." it's  something I feel comfortable about. I try to have a good social game but let's admit it, I'm  awkward. I'm not good at-- people-- how would I say it? Like, they vibe in a way they could never. But I have tond that this is a game, and you have to play by the  rules of the game. I guess I have to play ball! <br/>[ cheers ]  I've been dreaming of this moment since I was a kid. When I was, like eight years old I ask santa claus for a  "Survivor" buff. So I'm just dying to get it started. <br/>How are you going to chop that? <br/>Piece by piece. <br/>We're counting on you. <br/>Coming into this game, I'm really trying to put "Joey  amazing" away. <br/>I'm a better visual learner. <br/>You're a visual learner. It's hard, because new players are asking you, "Hey, what  should I do?" slam, 45. And you don't want to point yourself out as a threat, yet, you  have so much to offer these new players, so what do you do. <br/>You got it. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>You smell that? It smells like success. <br/>Aaahhhh! <br/>Fire! <br/>Having Joe on our team means I'm better set for this game. I don't have to make fire. Joe did that. I don't have to make a shelter. Joe did that. He's just amazing. And I would love to work with him in this game. I'm gay and I'm still on "Team Joe."  What next? <br/>Keep it alive. Don't let it die. <br/>I'm getting nowhere. <br/>It should not be this hard. [ laughs ] I'm done! I'm done! I'm trying to help out around camp as much as I can, but I live  in new york city. I have no outdoor survival skills whatsoever. Ow! Oh! I have a splinter! But it hurts. I think the closest that I can come to is that I peed in bushes  of central park once, and that was an emergency. So this is definitely going to be a test for me. <br/>Be careful with that. <br/>Because I don't want to be the person that everybody looks  at as, like, the older woman, she's a mom. What is she doing here? She doesn't have a clue. <br/>Yes! <br/>Yes! [ applause ]  Bamboo initiation. I think Kama is off to the best start I have seen any tribe in  "Survivor" have. We have all the rations. We have fire on the first day. We have a positive spirit. But I have something on my mind. I have a secret advantage in my pocket. There were 18 people in that boat, and I found it. And now I'm thinking I got to get away and read this thing. I need to get some more water. <br/>Yeah, do it. <br/>I scurred off, and I've only got a few spngdz "Dig  three feet east of your tree mail." initially, of course, I'm like, I'm  going to go right now. In "Survivor" you have to lie, manipulate, teach, and  as a teacher, I have all these students that are going to be looking at me. But they're not stupid. They know it's a game. The rules allow you to do these things. Oh, my God! <br/>I got a menu. I won the coupe de grace of "Survivor" advantages. I have the best that you could possibly have. It says, "You have found the advantage menu that allows you  to choose one of the following. If you lose a challenge, you can steal the reward from the other  tribe. Or you get an extra vote. Or I could get individual immunity. That would be awesome. It would play like a regular hidden immunity idol and I would  have to announce it before the vote was read. Coming in, my goal was not to be the first one voted out. But this has given me a new goal. I'm thinking this could propel me not only to last for a while  but to win "Survivor." "Edge of Extinction." what do you think it  means? <br/>I don't know, man. <br/>I don't, either. Everything has a reason. <br/>It's so cute. <br/>Isn't it? Like a little placemat. <br/>Maybe I'm naive but I feel like I've gotten good vibes  from everybody so far. <br/>Good. <br/>I feel like everybody's putting in work. <br/>Yeah. There are some players that realize the value of stRong people. Being a returnee, it is kind of terrifying to play with newbies  because if I pop my head up too much, it's going to get lopped off because  I'm going to have that "Returning player" target. <br/>I feel like we're in a good spot, though. <br/>I could help on fire forever. So I know that the best thing to do sometimes is lay in the  grass, and then come out look a cobra when the time is right. <br/> Tennessee. <br/>What part of tennessee? <br/>East tennessee, around pigeon forge. <br/>I'm not the good old southern boy. I know the show, and I'm here for one reason and one reason  only, and that's to win the title of sole Survivor. <br/>Tell me something country you do? <br/>I eat fried pickles. That million dollars is going to come in handy. And for the town of irwin, I might buy us a fourth stop light  and go on down through main street. I don't know yet. We'll see. <br/>So what do you think about having Joe and Aubry? <br/>I don't know. Part of the experience is figuring everything out. And I don't want to just like,ings, hey, Joe, how do we do this? Hey, Aubry, what do we do now?" I want to figure it out  ourselvess. Being a firefighter, at the very core it's taking care of people  so we get good at developing lightning-fast rapport, you know, like, for  example, with Gavin. Right away I kind of get a sense that he's somebody that is  thinking along the same lines. <br/>Someone new needs to win this game. <br/>We have to keep Joe for at least a while because he's best  shield in the world. <br/>Exactly. <br/>We'll just crouch behind his big, broad, beautiful  shoulders. We'll get rid of one of them if we lose. If it's up to me, it's about ge getting Aubry out of here fast. If I could do it tomorrow, that would be great. <br/>Are you guys drinking? <br/>Yes, ma'am. <br/>I'm gonna check the clothes on the beach, too. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Clothes on the beach. I put everything on the beach. I'm super pleased with how the tribe's going. So far, so good, man. We're all just getting to know each other. Everybody's work hard. Sweet! These are yours? Dry. There's definitely an appreciation for what everybody is doing  right now. <br/>She keeps, like, moving my... Around. <br/>I know. Reem is so sweet and just is, like, super helpful mom, but I  think some people are like, "Stop moving my stuff!"  She just can't help herself, man. In the south we would say, "Bless her heart."  Bless her heart. I know. <br/>I found my shirt out on the beach today. And I was like I had that hanging in a tree. <br/>I know. She goes, "I fut on the sand because it was wet." and  list like...  You just have that very motherly vibe. And I feel like--  Don't ever put me in that category. <br/>I know, I'm so sorry. <br/>It's all good. I know what you're saying. It's fine. You know what, dude, it's fine? <br/>I'm a momma's boy? <br/>Are you? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm here for you. But I'm going to tell you to tighten up if you get a little too  soft. <br/>I am young, I'm 19. And not having my mom out here is kind of affecting me. What do you do in favoriteville? <br/>I go to school. <br/>Where are you going? <br/>Du duke university. <br/>Good for you! <br/>Thank you, thank you. <br/>I feel like Reem is that motherly person out here. Once I found out I was going to be on the show, I was like,  well--  I would love to help you excel at swimming. <br/>Definitely, I would love that. I thought about going out to the water, practicing swimming. And Reem and Wendy even offered to help me with it. <br/>Keep going! Kick your feet! Kick your feet! <br/>Me and my family, we, like, live in a trailer in the  middle of the country. And that million dollars will change our lives. If I don't know something, I'm going to learn it. <br/>Look at Keith! <br/>Yes, Keith! <br/>Good job! <br/>That was really, really good. <br/>Who's out there, Wendy and Keith and Reem? <br/>They have their own three-person alliance. <br/>I don't know what they're doing down there. <br/>Perfect! We got the numbers. <br/>That worked. <br/>We started out as one big happy family, and we're still a  big happy family, but naturally Keith, Reem, and Wendy started doing their  own thing. And we saw that Keith wasn't a great swimmer. And Reem is a busy body. So it's been really helpful for the rest of us in the tribe  because we're sitting there going, "Wow, those three have divided  themselves and those might be the three we wanted to vote out anyway. So, okay, keep dividing yourselves. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>That's crazy. All right! Are you guys ready for your first immunity challenge? <br/>Yes! [ applause ]  Jeff: Let's do it! For today's challenge, you're going to maneuver through an  obstacle. One person must then climb to the top of the rope and ring a  bell. You'll then attempt to cross a three-tier balance beam. Once across, start untying knots to release a bar. That bar will make it much easier for the rest of the tribe to  cross the beam. One person must then climb to the top of the crow's nest, pull a  slefer to drop a slide. Once down, six players will work together to solve a giant slide  puzzle. First tribe to finish wins immunity. This is the immunity hideol. [ applause ] with this back at camp, it means you're not going  to tribal and nobody is going home. Without it, you are vulnerable. Are you also playing for reward, fire in the form of flint. Losers, tribal council, where somebody will be the first person  voted out of this game. I'll give you guys a minute to strategize, we'll get started. <br/>Oh, yeah! <br/>Jeff: All right, here we go! For immunity and reward. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, go, go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: Chris hopping over the rope! <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>You got it. Just lift them up. That's it, that's it! <br/>Jeff: You have to get everybody to your mat before you can  move on. <br/>Come on, come on. <br/>Let's go! <br/>Kama is going to get there first. Go, Kama. Go, Manu. It's going to be Joe and Chris going up the ropes. <br/>You got it, Joe! <br/>Jeff: This is no easy feat. That is pure strength. You gotta ring the bell. You're good, Joe, you're good, Chris. <br/>Go! <br/>Jeff: Everybody up the rope ladder. <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Anybody need help? Anybody need help? Come here, come here. <br/>Jeff: We are dead even right now. Joe, you're good! <br/>Go, Wendy. <br/>Jeff: It's going to be Joe heading across first. <br/>Hold it, hold it, hold it. <br/>Jeff: And Wendy. <br/>Lauren, go, Lauren, go. <br/>Joe, you got it. <br/>Jeff: Joe a across. Joe now untying knots trying to release that bar which will make  that beam a lot easier. It is be Lauren for Manu. Gavin's out. Lauren drops. <br/>That's it, erik! <br/>Erik now for Kama. Erik's across. Erik can now start working on the knots with Joe. There goes Aubry. Look at that! Aubry's across! <br/>I freaking love you guys. <br/>You got it, Chris. <br/>Jeff: Chris falls. Yis kris got to get back. So far, nobody from Manu is across. There goes David. <br/>Go quick, go quick, go quick! Come ocome on, come on. <br/>Jeff: David, will he be the to cross? He is! Start working on the knots. <br/>Jeff: Gavin drops, big fall! Kama has their bar free. <br/>Let's go. <br/>Jeff: Everybody cross. <br/>That's. You got it, nice. <br/>Jeff: Kama with the early lead in this first immunity  challenge. <br/>Just keep going, David, keep going. <br/>Jeff: There goes Lauren for Manu. Lauren crosses now for Manu. One person heads across. It's going to be erik. <br/>You got it. That's it, erik! <br/>Let's go, erik! <br/>Jeff: Erik now quickly to the top of the crow's nest. Pull the lever, release the slide. Erik drops the slide. <br/>Go! Go! <br/>Go! <br/>It's going to be Julie crossing now. One at a time. <br/>Ggirl. <br/>Jeff: It is Lauren and David still working on those knots  as Chris gives it another go. <br/>Come on, come on! Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Chris is across. He can start helping. Devyns is going it a go and devyns is across and Manu has a  little moment upum. There goes Wentworth. Wentworth with a huge fall. <br/>Okay, you okay? <br/>She gashed her head. <br/>Jeff: Wentworth took a huge hit on that beam. Wentworth, you okay? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Are you okay, dude? <br/>Good slide g! <br/>Got it! <br/>Jeff: Manu has their bar free. <br/>Get ready! Get ready. <br/>Run, run, run! <br/>Jeff: Manu running across. Manu with a lot of time to make up now. Lauren scampers across for Manu. You got it, Lauren. Lauren quickly to the top of the crow's nest. <br/>You got it, girl! <br/>Move, move, move, move! <br/>Jeff: Joe's across. Six people on the puzzle now. Gotta get the marked piece out. <br/>Ready? Push. <br/>Jeff: Kama working on the puzzle. <br/>One, two, three. Middle one. <br/>Jeff: Joe directing his tribe. <br/>All right, now this one. <br/>Jeff: These pieces are heavy. <br/>One, two, three. <br/>Let's go, Rick! <br/>Jeff: Manu knows challenges can be won or lost on the  puzzle. <br/>Go, Manu! <br/>This guy, over here. <br/>Jeff: David now trying to get an eye on this puzzle. This is where you can make a big comeback if you know how to do  this puzzle. <br/>One, two, three! <br/>Jeff: Can Manu close the gap or will Kama hold on to their  lead? <br/>It needs to be centered "P."  Small ones over? <br/>Jeff: Suddenly, Kama comes to a stop. <br/>Hold on. Slow down a little bit. <br/>Jeff: Manu now has a shot to get back in this. <br/>One, two, three. <br/>If this comes up, those go over. <br/>Yyes, yes, yes! <br/>Jeff: Kama think they've got something. Manu fighting to be in this. Everybody using all their strength. This could be very close! <br/>Gavin, push the one next to it a little. <br/>We're right there with them! <br/>Jeff: This challenge has taken a toll on a few bodes. <br/>We're almost there! We're almost there! <br/>It's stuck! <br/>Jeff: Kama sliding their last piece into place. Kama for the win. Kama wins immunity! Sending Manu to tribal council. Where somebody will be the first person voted out of this game. Wow! <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: Kama, congratulations. First immunity win. [ applause ]. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Here we are, tribal council tonight, somebody going  home. Kama, it will not be anybody from your tribe. Enjoy the night off. Oh, almost forgot your reward. Flint. <br/>Thank you, sir. <br/>Thanks, Jeff! <br/>Jeff: All right, Manu, I think Wentworth's face says it  all. Nothing about this game is easy. First person will be voted out tonight. Should make for an interesting afternoon back at camp. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>Losing first challenge is one of the worst thing to happen  to you. You have very little wiggle room. You have known these people for three games daze. And I know any little thing can cent you out of this game and  you can be gone in a second. <br/>I'm sorry, you guys. <br/>I'm so pissed! <br/>You never come out here expecting to lose at that's first  immunity challenge. Even though I feel I'm more introverted, I need to have more  one-on-one conversations. <br/>What's the split? Tell me what's going on? What's on your mind. <br/>It seems like Lauren and Kelley seem pretty tight. And I'm not saying that they're shady, but Lauren and Kelley  need to be separated. Those two are like a power couple. <br/>As soon as I was at the well, Reem was not afraid to put  it out there. They want to get kelly and Lauren. They have linked them up as this dynamic duothat they think has  control of everything, so they're trying to get the votes together to get one  of those two out. <br/>Are you seriously not working with them? <br/>Not yet. <br/>And they're just dogging Rick down. He doesn't even have, like, a chance to breathe. <br/>What are you thinking? <br/>Of those two. <br/>What are you thinking in general? <br/>So I wasn't really feeling the whole well vibe. And something clicked in my head they have to start playing this  game for me. And at the end of the day, no matter who goes home, I just can't  be the one to go home. <br/>They crowded me and Rick instantly and they're trying to  pull Rick to their side. And the target's on y'all. <br/>Of course, yeah. <br/>Obviously we know what we're door, right? <br/>I definitely think we need to keep the tribe stRong is the  bottom line. Like, no matter what. <br/>I just feel like we have a better chance of winning the  next challenge with Wendy and it seems that's more important than anything. <br/>I don't with Reem. <br/>If someone it just kind of keep tabs on Wendy. <br/>Let me pull her aside and see what she says and who she  throws out there. <br/>All right, why don't you, yeah, yeah. <br/>Wentworth and Lauren, I don't like how tight they are. They're a couple, andun couples are the wig biggest threat. <br/>A lot of people don't have faith in Reem. <br/>I just want you to know the kind of player. I'm voting with Reem tonight. Just out of loyalty to her. <br/>No, I get it. <br/>I feel like they're not giving enough credit to Reem. They're really just taking her age into account. <br/>You know what? I'm going to put all these right in the sun. <br/>She can't help her age, but she can pull her wait waet,  which she has been doing. <br/>I know you're trying to save your friend and that shows  loyalty but it's a sinking ship. She's going home tonight. <br/>Think about it. <br/>Let me talk to David. <br/>You guys talk, but come back to me. <br/>I will. <br/>I'm serious. <br/>We will, we will. <br/>Okay. <br/>Well, here's what I'm thinking now. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>My mind has changed a little bit. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>Maybe we just take Wendy out. She's too stubborn. Wendy, it was extremely surprising to me no matter how, like,  direct we were telling her it was going to be Reem, she pushed back. And that's at least causing alarm in my head. What does that mean down the road? I can work with someone like that? What helps me and you out? Where are we best? This vote tonight I think should maybe be Wendy. <br/>They want to vote her off? <br/>They want to vote me off? When you hear your name out there, it's like, "Screw you,  dude." just because I didn't go, like, power lift before I showed up,  like, they're idiots. I am so stRong. You don't even know this old lady, bro. This old lady can kill it. I know that they're throwing my name around. And I don't really blif a... Because--  Would you put the machete down? <br/>Wentworth, doesn't dnt she get hurt today? I didn't get hurt today. I'm not done. Scrappy, dude. I'm not going down without a fight. I didn't leave everything to go down like that. Screw them, man. <br/>Jeff: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch, approach the flame, dip it in and get  fire. This is part of the ritual of tribal council because in this  game, fire represents your life. And when your fire is gone, so are you. Let's talk about first impression. Devens, what did you notice about the initial vibe of the tribe,  just as a group? <br/>Right off the bat, actually, I think it was one big tribe. But as the day progressed, some people were weaving fRond, some  people were working on the shelter, so, obviously, people kind of formed  mini-groups within the largey group. <br/>Jeff: Reem, did you notice, that people paired in threes  or fours? <br/>It's like people who were working on certain things just  ended up talking because they were working together. It's not like they were --  You seem annoyed already. <br/>My name got thrown out today. I'm pissed off, and there's no good reason behind it. It's not like people were secretly speaking among each other. They were just doing their jobs, you know what I mean? Whatever. I'm just in general annoyed. <br/>But that is part of this game. You know, my name was thrown out there. I heard Lauren's name. I heard Reem's name. It's how this game it played. <br/>Fimay-- the reason why her name was even thrown out is  because she's a legend, you know. It was an honor to have her name thrown out, really. <br/>It's not an honor when you can still be voted out. <br/>No disrespect. She is a great, great player. <br/>Why not mention David's name? Why me specifically? I'm just wondering jiek I'll not done. Here's the funny thing, my name was thrown out apparently  because they want to keep the tribe stRong. I'm going with age discrimination, to be quite honest with you. Because how would you know if I wasn't stRong or not stRong? I mean, do we need to have, like a wrestling competition here? <br/>Is that something we can do in tribal, Jeff? <br/>I'm just saying. <br/>Jeff: Reem, is this normal for you? <br/>What? <br/>Jeff: Are you a little confRontational just by nature back  home? <br/>Not confRontational, but if I think someone's wRong, I'll  definitely be like, "I don't understand why you think you're  right." help me understand. That's what I was wondering. <br/>If anything, Reem, if someone's being a little too much,  sometimes it rubs different personalities the wRong way. <br/>Who was I being too much to? <br/>To me, you're a little too much. <br/>Why? With what? <br/>You're doing stuff and moving things around and people  can't find their thidges and remind people to, like, drink their water and  put their shoes on. I know there's good in all of that. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/> Sometimes people don't want to hear a motherly figure. <br/>I did that so nobody's stuff got wet. <br/>Totally agree. <br/>I was being caring, considerate. <br/>Tell me more. , please, I'd love to learn. <br/>You're taking this one example and milking it. Personalities clash. We all really like everybody but one person--  I'm the hated person on the tribe. <br/>See, you're put-- I never used the word "Hated."  in my opinion, your personality would be hardest for me to deal with for 39  days. <br/>But your clothes were dry though, for the record, were  they not? <br/>No, but I-- okay, you're right. <br/>Jeff: Wendy, where do you weigh in on this? <br/>I do share conflicting pbs about Reem. The same reasons they dislike her, I like her. I'm really close to my mom, so with her being here, it kind of  helps me out. <br/>I don't think anyone dislikes Reem. <br/>I agree. <br/>If we had something hanging in the tree, that was probably  my way of drying it out. <br/>I can just be honest with you all? If you didn't want me to touch your stuff all you had to do was  say, "Hey, please, don't touch my stuff." done. I appreciate your honesty, I do. I'm sorry I touched thur your things. <br/>Jeff: Reem, when you say, "It's my fault,"  that's not what you really mean? <br/>When I came out here, I wasn't going to tell anybody how  old I am, that I was a mom. But I am their mom. They don't want their mom out here with them. That's fine. I wouldn't have-- a lot of things would have happened  differently, yes. <br/>Jeff: Wendy, what do you think's going to happen tonight? <br/>Just from, like, the talk from the camp and everything, I  am sorry to say, but I feel like Reem's going home. <br/>Oh, it's like a nightmare. <br/>Jeff: Reem, we haven't had a lot of tribals where almost  the entire conversation has centered around one person. <br/>I don't know. Like, I'm not going to lie to you. This is, like, a freaking nightmare to be the first one voted  off, you know, because I've been watching since day one. Like, this is terrible. I'm so disappointed. I guess it was just too much for them. But I hope it's not too much for my best friends and my family,  because I'm just surprised. And, you know, famous last words. Don't be the first one voted out. <br/>Jeff: Somebody always is. <br/>I know. <br/>Jeff: All right, it is time to vote. Kelley, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. <br/>Jeff: If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want  to play it, now would be the time to do so. Okay. I'll read the votes. First vote, Reem. Kelley. Wendy. Lauren. Reem. That's two votes Reem. <br/>Shocker. <br/>Wendy. That's two votes Wendy, two votes Reem, one vote Lauren, one  vote Wentworth. Reem. That's three votes Reem. Wendy. We're tied, three votes Wendy, three votes Reem, one vote left. First person voted out of "Survivor: Edge of Extinction,"  Reem. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Jeff: Reem, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Jeff: Time for you to go. <br/>Bye, Reem. <br/>Thank you! I hope it pours down rain on those people. Ridiculous. [ thunder ] so lame. What? "You have a decision to make." "If you do not  want to play anymore, follow this path, and your adventure will end."  "If you want a chance to get back in the game, take the torch and get on  the boat"? Hm. Nice! <br/>Oh, my God! There is nothing here. What is going on? Holy crap! What is it? <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode  Jeff: Next time on "Survivor":  If your fire is too bright. <br/>They had their moment to shine. It's our chance. <br/>Joe and I are under a magnifying glass. <br/>Jeff: A phoenix mutt turn. To rise fromlet ashes opinion. <br/>What do I have to go through for this second chance? No offense, but screw my tribe. Like, you're mad they put your freaking clothes on the beach to  dry? Whatever. And I don't want to cry because I'm still in the game and I'm  happy to be in the game, but it's wet and it's cold. I just gotta stick it out. Edge of freaking extinction.
