<br/>Jeff: 39 days ago, 16 Americans began the adventure of a lifetime. <br/>Kimmi: We have a map. <br/>Nick: I guess we're starting here. <br/>Jeff: They were abandoned in the Australian Outback, cut off from their jobs, their loved ones and all contact with civilization. Their goal? Work together to build a new world but compete against each other to become the sole survivor and win $1 million. Kucha! <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my God! Kucha, Kucha! <br/>Jeff: As two separate tribes, Kucha and Ogakor, they strategized. <br/>Jeff V.: We're just trying to figure out who probably is Ogakor's weak link. <br/>Jerri: If we slip anything out, we're done. <br/>Jeff: They formed alliances. <br/>Alicia: The truth of the matter is, I feel like you're the only one that I really trust at this point. <br/>Jerri: It's not like you're making a deal with the devil here. <br/>Jeff: And battled for immunity so they would not have to vote one of their own out of the tribe. The tribe has spoken. Three members from Ogakor and two from Kucha met their untimely end in the first 15 days. [ screaming] [ groaning]  Nick: He's burnt pretty bad there. <br/>Oh, my... Oh, my God. <br/>Alicia: Keep your hands in the water. <br/>Jeff: On day 17, Michael from Kucha was forced to leave when he fell into the fire and severely burned his hands. <br/>Michael: Kucha! You guys know what to do. <br/>Jeff: His evacuation left the tribes with five members each. On day 20 came the merge, and a new tribe, Barramundi, was born. Since that time, the tribe mates have been forced to reconsider old alliances and evaluate new friendships. <br/>Alicia: It's a whole new game, new people, new set of rules. <br/>Elisabeth: If you want to keep playing this game, you better get a little more ruthless. <br/>Tina: I want the good guys to win. <br/>Jeff: They have been pushed to the physical brink. <br/>Elisabeth: My hair is falling out. My hair. <br/>Jeff: They've endured overwhelming hunger. <br/>Amber: This is the least amount of rice we've ever had. <br/>Tina: No wonder we're all so weak and tired. <br/>Jeff: And the harsh conditions of an unforgiving land. <br/>Keith: That was the most miserable night in my entire life. <br/>Jeff: They have made sacrifices... Shelter versus food, it's one or the other. Your tarps and that Texas flag. ...and faced the emotional toll of their experience. Is that a little tear in your eye? <br/>Rodger: Yes, it is. <br/>Jeff: But through it all, they have continued to play the game. <br/>Jerri: There's nothing fair about this. It's about winning. <br/>Keith: Yes. If you come out holding the immunity, then your position is set. If you don't come out holding your immunity, you better have your bags packed when you go to Tribal Council. <br/>Jeff: Go! Last time, Colby again dominated the challenges. <br/>Colby: Yeah! <br/>Jeff: First he won a new car and a visit from his mother as a reward. <br/>Colby: Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Then he won immunity for the fourth consecutive time. This has had a permanent home here for awhile. <br/>Colby: Just been.... been pretty fortunate. <br/>Jeff: So the remaining members of Barramundi headed off to Tribal Council, and in a difficult decision, Elisabeth was voted out. Only three are left. Tonight they will compete in one final immunity challenge. Two will continue on to face the jury. One will outlast all the rest and become the sole survivor. [ animal calling] [ birds singing] [ animal calling] [ birds singing] [ birds calling]  Keith: This morning is [ birds calling]  Keith: This morning is homestretch. There's only three of us left, and, uh... we have three days. This is what the 42 days is all about. It's about these last three days. I mean, everything else becomes just... a product to get to this point. <br/>Colby: I had the best night's sleep I've had in 39 nights last night. Solid night's sleep. You know, whenever you go to bed, and you lay there for so long, and you think about a lot of stuff? I don't remember having one thought after I went to lie down. I mean, I was asleep that quick. The temperature was good, I guess, 'cause I didn't wake up cold at all. <br/>Keith: Right, we have no rain, so we're really getting lucky. <br/>Colby: The environment and the elements here have probably been the most dominant player in this game. You've got the 17th player here, and it's the environment, because it's the one dropping you to your knees, kicking you in the butt. And every time you feel like you're getting up, you get knocked down again. Either the heat or the lack of food or the-the flooding, the rains. Something's going to be... You know, you're going to get a curve ball, no matter what. <br/>Keith: Let's see. Do we have two days? <br/>Colby: Yeah. Three days-- Friday, Saturday, Sunday, six meals. <br/>Keith: Yeah, we're in... We're... we'll make it, we got...  Colby: Six meals at half a cup a meal? No problem. Plus, we got peanut butter. Not much of it, either. <br/>Keith: It's exciting...  Colby: We're living on the edge in our rations. Whether you want to admit it or not, you deteriorate. In 40 days, day 40 is ten times harder than day 20 was. No question about it. Because you're weaker, because you're tired, because you're-you're sick of dealing with everything you've had to deal with. And you've still got to play the game. You've still got to think about what's-what's at hand, and that's, you know, surviving the people long enough to get in a position to win. <br/>Tina: On day 40, being here becomes this overwhelming surprise. I cannot believe that I'm here. Even though I'm a competitor, and I came here with the idea of winning challenges, of having an adventure, of doing well, I never thought I could get this far. [ birds singing] As this game is coming to an end, I think that I have evolved, that who I started out as in this game is not who I've ended up as. I have developed more into a strategist, and it worked to get me from 16 to three. <br/>Colby: Trusting people in this game will get you in trouble. And even quicker, it'll get you gone. And that's-that's because it's a game. And in a way, that's where it parallels life. But in a way, that's where it differs from life for me, because the only person I've been truly 100% honest to in this game is myself. And in real life, I'm not that way. I'm an honest person. But I'm playing to win a million dollars here, and so if you trust somebody, it's your own fault. You're a fool for not playing the game. [ rattling]  Colby: This will be one of our last tree mails. <br/>Tina: Yup. <br/>Colby: We won't be getting too many more. <br/>Tina: Wow. <br/>Colby: Oh, look at this. <br/>Tina: Sweet! Holy cow. What is...? <br/>Colby: It looks like paint, paintbrushes. <br/>Tina: "After so many days, it is almost the last. And now it is time to reflect on the past. <br/>TINA AND Colby: "Carve your own idol..."  Tina: "...as a gift to the land. From the 16 survivors, now just three of you stand."  Colby: Oh, wow. <br/>Tina: We get to carve it...  Colby: From a little...  Tina: ...and paint it. <br/>Colby: Like a little totem, a little idol. <br/>Tina: Yes. Cool thing, Colby. <br/>Colby: Man, this is going to be all sorts of fun. Good. <br/>Tina: Ah...  Colby: When we first got the tree mail, and-and reading through it, and it said, "Giving back to the land," I was intimidated by that. <br/>Tina: Oh, wow, look at this. Beads and trinkets. <br/>Colby: Hmm. We'll have to think about this. At first, I didn't know how. I didn't know how to approach that whole statement. And it took a-a lot of time today to remember how much I've taken from the land. We've used it for our shelter, we've use it to stick food in our belly. And at first, I didn't get the big picture, but when you do stop and think about it for a while and really put your mind to it, you realize that you've been given a lot. <br/>Keith: When we had a chance to work on the idol, it was an all-day process, so you had a lot of reflection time. You thought about, uh, crossing the river for the first time, you thought about eating your first fish, loved ones back home. It was a healing process, actually. It helped put closure to everything. <br/>Tina: For me personally, I'm proud of the fact that I'm a woman and I'm here in the final three with two men. And so, I wanted my idol to be feminine in her own way. <br/>Colby: While I was working on that totem-- whether it was painting or carving or-or stringing beads or whatever-- I was reflecting and thinking about... thinking about what the last 40 days have meant to me. I struggled with it at first, trying to figure out what I was supposed to do or needed to do. And then I thought, you know, it's mine. And it took me a while to-to grasp that, to think that, you know, there's notany rules. Just like this game, there are no rules, no holds barred, play it how you want, and see what happens. [ bird screeching] happens. [ bird screeching] [ insects chirping] [ insects chirping]  Colby: Six weeks. See, six weeks sounds so much longer than 42 days to me. <br/>Tina: Mm-hmm, it seems like three weeks... doesn't it? <br/>Keith: 41 days ago, guys, we crossed this river right here. <br/>Tina: Whew! Loaded to the brim. <br/>Keith: Yeah. [ Tina sighs]  Colby: Mm-hmm. <br/>Keith: And we didn't know each other. <br/>Tina: I remember us talking all night long, you know, and being so excited and thinking about... I remember thinking, "God, we've got so long to go, you know, we've got a long road ahead of us."  Colby: It's been a hell of a ride. <br/>Tina: Mm-hmm. It's been a long, long journey. And everything surrounding this game is one big emotional pull. And now, you've only got three days left, and the people that you've shared life with 24-7 for the past 42 days is going to be over. <br/>Keith: Tonight is the last night for one of us to be sleeping here. Tonight is the last night for somebody. <br/>Colby: It is kind of weird to think about... not being here tomorrow night, isn't it? <br/>Tina: Oh, I mean, it kills me. It's like... I mean, I'm ready to go home and see my family, but I'm just... I don't want to leave this place. <br/>Colby: I agree. <br/>Tina: You know, I really love Australia, I really love the Outback. <br/>Colby: Well, and the hardest thing for me, I think, with the possibility of leaving is it's hard for me to grasp checking out of the game before it's over. <br/>Tina: Mmm. <br/>Colby: And I've never even thought about that until just now. And that's what tomorrow night is for somebody. <br/>Tina: It's not like you voluntarily are checking out, you know? <br/>Colby: That's what I'm saying. I mean, that's the reality. But damn it, I'll take it like a man. [ Tina laughs]  Keith: Yes. <br/>Colby: I won't like it, but I'll take it like a man. <br/>Keith: We all will. <br/>Tina: I'm not. I'm going to have a hissy fit, and just cry and bawl and hissy fit is what I'm going to do. <br/>Colby: It's going to be weird sitting in Tribal Council just three chairs right there, too. <br/>Keith: Ooh... is it ever. <br/>Colby: 'Cause it's only one vote. <br/>Tina: Ooh! <br/>Keith: Right. <br/>Colby: Three of us don't vote; it's just immunity. <br/>Keith: Right. <br/>Colby: Walks up, puts his name in the bucket and comes back. <br/>Tina: That's not gonna... that's not gonna be a fun place to be, either. <br/>Colby: No...  Tina: The immunity man or woman or...  Colby: Nope. <br/>Keith: Oh, that's right. <br/>Colby: One person, that's it. <br/>Keith: We have an immunity challenge coming up, the most important immunity challenge that any of us... any of us will play. The winner basically gets to walk up and cast a vote. At this stage of the game, we all feel vulnerable, because at that stage it's not a voting bloc. It's who you want to be in the finals with. Who do you want the jury to look at sitting next to you to potentially choose you over them to give you the money? That's what it's about now. Tough call. <br/>Tina: This last morning, you know, everything seems like the last for the three of us. And it's just... I know it's a game, but still it's sad, you know. It's not just a game coming to an end, but it's the game coming to an end and the three of us leaving each other's company. <br/>Keith: The last 24 hours has kind of been a little bittersweet. One of us is leaving tonight, one of us saw the sunset for the last time and the sunrise this morning for the last time. One of us had the last meal with us together. So it was... it's kind of... you know, it's strange, it's bittersweet, it's sad. I want you to know that these are made with a great deal of love and passion for you guys. This is not just a normal breakfast. <br/>Tina: And I just want you to know that they're eaten with a great deal of love and passion. <br/>Keith: From the bottom of this chef's heart to you guys' stomach. <br/>Tina: Thank you. <br/>Keith: Mm-hmm. Oh, that one's warm. <br/>Colby: I don't want to think about leaving tonight. It's a very real possibility. This whole experience has been full of firsts and lasts, every day. But that's just one facet I don't like dwelling on. <br/>Keith: What do we have there, Colby? <br/>Colby: Madam. <br/>Keith: What is it? <br/>Tina: "And now it is time to pack up your gear. The ridge of the river is the course you will steer. You will pass by the torches of the survivors cut adrift. When you reach the end, you will offer your gift."  Keith: The tree mail gave instructions on where we should go with the totem that we created, and we're going to walk past the torches of all the survivors that went before us. And at the end of the walk, we're going to offer the gift up that we made. <br/>Tina: Every now and then, you get a glimpse of closure and you get a glimpse of the impact, and you get a glimpse of how significant it is that you've gotten this far. And I can already feel it starting to rise. You know, I can already feel the... anxiety of some sort in my chest and a warm fuzzy, you know, coming on. And I don't think this is going to be easy. I think this is going to be, you know, one of those times of saying good-bye. And I don't know why saying good-bye is so hard. You know, my gosh, we've been put through the wringer. I don't know why it should be so hard, but, uh... it's hard to say good-bye. <br/>Colby: I think the three of us are very emotionally attached to each other right now. And if the word "love" comes out of your mouth, then that's the emotion you're feeling at that time, you know? I don't love the two of them like I love my family, not yet. I haven't known them long enough. But you still share a bond that I guess you could call love, I mean because you'd have to love some of these people to put up with them in the context that we have for 42 days. <br/>Keith: I think that it seems somewhat apropos for this situation, you know? That we'd walk past individuals that left before us. One of us will be leaving tonight, and there'll be two left. So I'm actually... I'm looking forward to it. I guess it's kind of a saying good-bye process. <br/>Jeff: Hey, guys. <br/>Jeff: Hey, guys. One of the things I've gathered from chatting with you guys for 41 days is that this has been a life-changing experience for the three of you. And part of that growth comes from examining the past. That was the purpose of the walk you just took, a chance to think about your former tribe members, how they played the game, what you learned from them. Now I want to give you a chance to reflect on your time here in the Outback, how you've played the game, the highs, the lows and what you'll take back home with you from this experience. This is the last waterfall before Tribal Council, a fitting spot to think about the time you've spent out here. So what I'd like you to do is take the idols with you that you've created over the last couple of days, find a quiet spot and just reflect on your time here in the Outback. And when you're ready, come back to this spot and then offer your idols by tossing them in the river. This is a chance for you guys to give something back to a land that has given so much to you. When you're finished, you'll make the trek together to Tribal Council for the final immunity challenge, and I'll be waiting for you there. Enjoy this time. All right. <br/>Keith: The time that I've spent here has been a cleansing process. And I'm 40 years old, I've got two wonderful kids, and have had, like any other individual who's 40 years old, have had failures and successes and highs and lows. In the last five days, I've realized this really is not about the money, and it shouldn't be. You should walk away from this with something that's far more valuable than money, and I will. I don't think that I have the opportunity to win the money. I don't think I'll be at that level. I mean, I'm close, but I don't think I'll be of the last two, and it's totally fine with me. I'm so enriched by everything I've gained from this process and this experience. I feel really great about it. I feel very content. <br/>Tina: I've got to share the past 42 days with a lot of people who are extremely close to their family. I think that, you know, I've been guilty of living my life and trying to be this strong individual who didn't really need anybody and, um... and ver... fiercely independent. And I think for the first time in my life, the outback has taught me the value of how much your family means to you and that you really do need each other. And whenever I get home, I want to go back and, for the first time, really nurture my family. <br/>Colby: That's what being here for 42 days has done for us-- it's made us realize what we take for granted at home and all those things in our daily living when we're in our comfort zone that we don't appreciate because we're so used to having them. Well, we've been out here for 42 days, and now we appreciate those things back home. Now we appreciate those people that we've taken for granted and the little things they say, the way they say our name and all those cool things that you can't wait to get back to. And that's what making these idols was about, so that we appreciate and remember why we were here. <br/>Jeff: Hey, guys. Go ahead and have a seat. Just hold your tablets. We'll now bring in the jury. I'll start by asking you to pass down the immunity necklace, Colby. Well, welcome to Tribal Council in a slightly different set of circumstances. You guys have just completed a day that was really a rite of passage, a chance to remember your former tribe mates. Now, the final immunity challenge will test how well you know the folks you've spent the last 41 days with. It's called "Fallen Comrades." I'm going to ask you a series of questions about those people you voted out of the tribe, six of which are sitting right across from you. There'll be 12 questions about your former tribe mates. Whoever has the most correct answers wins immunity, guarantees themselves a spot in the final two and the right to choose the person that sits next to them. So you're going to write your answers in big, bold letters on your tablet, hold it up to your chest until I tell you to, and then turn it around. Question number one: which former survivor would be the one to tell you to "work your magic"? Okay, turn them around, please. Everybody says Alicia. Everybody's right, it was Alicia. Question number two: what town is Rodger from? Everybody reveal. Critteden. Crittenden. Criton. All right, you were there. Everybody's right. <br/>Keith: I couldn't spell "Crittenden."  Jeff: Question number three: according to their Survivor applications, who was the only member of the Barramundi tribe with a master's degree? Everybody reveal. Nick, Nick and Jeff. Everybody's wrong. It's Rodger. He had a master's of arts in industrial education. <br/>Tina: He never told us that. <br/>Jeff: Nobody scores on that one. Question number four: who spent 12 years living in Germany? Reveal. Jerri, Jerri, Jerri. Everybody's right. We're still tied at three each. Question number five. It's a visual question. Who is this person? <br/>Jeff: Okay, everybody ready? Who is this person? <br/>Jeff: Okay, everybody ready? Reveal. Kenny, Elisabeth's brother and Johnny. Kenny is Elisabeth's brother. Colby and Tina are both right. Colby and Tina, you're both at four. Keith, you're at three. Question number six: what two survivors have tattoos of Chinese characters? Okay, reveal. Keith says Alicia and Amber. Tina says Alicia and Nick. Colby: Jeff and Kimmi. Nobody's right. It was Alicia and Jeff Varner. Question number seven: Jeff and Alicia also wear jewelry on the same part of their body. What is it, and where do they wear it? Okay, everybody reveal. Colby says thumb ring. Tina, ring on the toe. And Keith says bracelet and foot anklet. Colby's right. Thumb rings they both wear. <br/>Tina: Colby. Colby moves into the lead with five. Tina, you're at four. Keith, still at three. Five questions left. Question number eight: whose shorts are these? Everybody reveal. shorts are these? Everybody reveal. Jeff, Nick and Kel. Correct answer: Nick. Tina now has five, along with Colby. Keith, you're still at three. Four questions left. What is Elisabeth's boyfriend's name? Everybody reveal. Tim, Tim, Tim. Everybody's right. Three questions left. Colby and Tina are tied. Keith, you're down two. Question ten. It's a follow-up question. What college did they both attend? Everybody reveal. Colby says Boston College. Tina, Boston College. Keith, Boston University. Boston University not correct. It's Boston College. Colby and Tina both score. Colby, you have seven. Tina, you've got seven. Keith, you only have four. You're down three. Just two questions left. No need for you to answer any more. Colby, Tina, it's down to you two. Question number 11: who said on their Survivorapplication that they would like to be stranded with President Clinton or the Pope, because they're the most likely to be rescued? [ laughs] Everybody reveal. Jeff and Alicia. Neither one is right. Nick is the correct answer. <br/>Tina: Oh...  Jeff: Here we are-- the final question. Colby, you've got seven. Tina, you've got seven. This is it. One of you gets it right and the other doesn't, immunity, going to the final two. "Who stated on their Survivor application form that their proudest accomplishment was being on the dean's list in college for five semesters?" For immunity, reveal your answers. Tina says Nick. Colby says Amber. Correct answer... Amber. <br/>Colby: Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Colby continues his streak. You've just won immunity. Here's where we're at: it's time for the final vote. Keith and Tina can't vote for themselves. Tina has to vote for Keith. Keith has to vote for Tina. Their votes nullify each other. You're the only person who's going to vote. You are voting out one person from the tribe, and more importantly, you are deciding who's going to go to the final two with you. So you're going to go up there, cast that very important vote, put it in the box and bring the box back with you to me. It's time to vote, Colby. Once the vote is read, the decision is final. The person voted out of the tribe will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. Somebody who has played this game for 41 days is about to be voted out of the tribe. I'll read the vote. The 14th person voted out of the tribe... is Keith. <br/>Keith: It has been an honor, guys. <br/>Tina: I love you. <br/>Keith: Aw...  Tina: See you soon. <br/>Colby: Good job. <br/>Jeff: Keith, the tribe has spoken. Long day for you guys. Tonight'll be the last night you spend under these stars. Tomorrow, an even bigger day. Final Tribal Council, a final vote that will determine which one of you leaves here with a million dollars and the title of Survivor: The Australian Outback. Try to get a good night's sleep. You're going to need it. You can head back to camp. <br/>Keith: It was an absolute honor to play this game with these participants. My time here spent in the Outback really gave me an opportunity to look at life from the past, present and the future. It was a great, great opportunity, and I've learned so much about myself because of it. <br/>Tina: Usually, when we've left Tribal Council, there's been a wide range of emotions... such as Mad Dog. When we voted her off, that was a sad day at the Ogakor camp. And there were other times that we came back to camp where it just felt awkward. We really loved Elisabeth, and it just felt awkward almost not having her presence there. And there's been some times when we came back from camp, and we were a little happy. <br/>Colby: Golly, Tina, this is our last night, girl. We can afford to burn those candles out if we want to. <br/>Tina: I know it. No longer do we have to worry, you know, "How long will that last?" Last night, coming into camp, just me and Colby, I have to say that it was sheer exhilaration. We can burn that, some of our shelter stuff...  Colby: I mean, seriously, like this twine. We don't need it, do we? <br/>Tina: Nope. <br/>Colby: It burns good. <br/>Tina: Burn it, baby. I accomplished something that I wanted to do, and that was to make it to last two. I still feel that I can't comprehend this. It'll be a few days before...  Colby: Oh, sure. <br/>Tina: ...you know, to even let it soak in. <br/>Colby: Returning from Tribal Council was the best feeling I've had in 42 days. It was a victorious feeling. 16 of us started, and-and we were the two that beat 'em all. <br/>Tina: What else can we burn? <br/>Colby: What else? <br/>Tina: Poor Keith. This would be his favoritest thing to do. This last immunity, I was a nervous wreck. Had Keith won, I'm not sure whether or not he would have voted for me to stay with him. Ooh, that's a good fire, Colby. <br/>Colby: I think, when it came down to it, more than likely, he would've kept Tina on board and gotten rid of me, so I needed to keep immunity from Keith. That was my only objective last night. You're a sore loser. That's what I'm realizing. You don't like losing. <br/>Tina: I hate losing. When's the last time you won something? <br/>Tina: Reward challenge. It's the last time I've won. <br/>Colby: Keith might've been the only way Tina and I could've gotten here. And trust me, we tried every way possible to figure out how we could vote Keith off instead of Rodger, but sometimes, you've got to bring along people that you don't necessarily want to. <br/>Tina: I don't think Keith could've made it this far on his own accord. You know, we kind of pulled Keith along. We needed a third as part of an alliance to have a majority vote, and we've kept Keith around for that reason. <br/>Colby: He got us where we needed to be. <br/>Tina: Yep. <br/>Colby: And he didn't win a million dollars. That's the best part about it. No matter what happens, Keith Famie didn't win a million bucks. [ Tina chuckles] I don't think Keith earned the right to sit in a position of-of one of the final two in this game. I don't think he played the game in a fashion or well enough to deserve that spot. <br/>Tina: All my jobs have always been minimum wage jobs, except for when I was a flight attendant, and so I've never felt like I've been a contributing factor financially. You know, however much money it is, I've contributed to the family financial situation. <br/>Colby: Yep. <br/>Tina: And it just makes me feel so good. <br/>Colby: And you earned it. You worked hard for it. <br/>Tina: Whew! <br/>Colby: You know? <br/>Tina: Good night, my friend. [ insects chirping] [ Colby groans]  Tina: Good morning. [ Colby murmurs indistinctly]  Tina: Mm, you're warm. <br/>Colby: It's a great day. I mean, it is... it is only going to get better each hour that-that goes by, and we realize we're one step closer to tonight. I mean, it's awesome. Mission accomplished. I mean, we've done everything we can. <br/>Tina: I felt joy. I felt peace. I began to feel closure for the first time. I want to spend the day taking some visual pictures, capturing those to take 'em home with me. <br/>Colby: You can see over everything. This is the appropriate place for Tina and I-- the-the highest peak that we could see or climb to from our camp. Getting as high as we can and literally feeling like you're on top of the world in more ways than one. They're everywhere up here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...  Tina: And here's some more. <br/>Colby: ...eight, nine, ten. <br/>Tina: God, they're fast, aren't they? <br/>Colby: That I'm going to miss-- just kangaroos running wild. [ Tina chuckles]  Tina: I look at Colby. He came here for one thing: to win a million dollars. He didn't come here to make friends. He didn't come here for any other reason, and his actions show that. He speaks it. He lives it. He's wide open. <br/>Colby: In the game of Survivor,you've got to switch hats a lot. You've got to wear a white hat part of the time, and sometimes, you got to put on the black hat, and that's the only way you can do good at this game. You've got to be the bad guy sometimes. You've got to be a little bit selfish, but hopefully, in the end, you wore a white hat more of the time than you did a black hat. Tina has played the game better than anyone else. She hasn't flown under the radar; however, she hasn't ruffled any feathers. She's stayed on course the entire time. I think she knew where she wanted to be and how she was going to get there much earlier than I did. 41 days, I've realized that it is life's subtleties that I cherish the most, and that's it. <br/>Tina: That's pretty heavy, Colby. You did some thinking on that little perch. <br/>Colby: I did. <br/>Tina: How are we going to do the flag? I was going to say either winner gets it...  Colby: I say... Yeah. <br/>Tina: Or we play for it. <br/>Colby: No, I say winner gets it. <br/>Tina: Okay. I think it's important for Colby and I to break down the camp... kind of as a tribute. That bark worked pretty good, didn't it, Colby? <br/>Colby: It really did. Shelter turned out... pretty effective. <br/>Tina: The shelter was built with no food in our system, very, very weak bodies. That day, building that shelter was very, very tough. And to take it down now is almost like saying, "It was worth it, because look where I am. I'm one of the two. It was worth it."  Colby: The day this structure went up was the worst I had ever seen Tina. It was her all-time low in the 42 days we've been here. <br/>Tina: I was not only physically low, I was mentally pretty low, going...  Colby: You were done, mentally. <br/>Tina: I thought, "How many more days do I have to do this?" because I was worried it wasn't going to get any better. <br/>Colby: That was your worst day. Winning this game means so much to me and is so important to me because of the level of difficulty, because it's been so tough to get to this point. And it has taken so much out of me-- physically, emotionally, mentally. But that's why it means so much to win this game-- 'cause I have so much invested in it. <br/>Tina: What it boils down to is that I've come here for 42 days to starve, to live in the type of environment that I've lived in, to make those type of sacrifices to give somebody like Elisabeth a million dollars? Or did I come here to play this game and medeserve the million dollars? <br/>Colby: I've been selfish in the way I've played. However, I'm choosing to go into the finals with Tina, and that's not a selfish move, 'cause if I was 100% selfish, I would choose to go in with Keith. I feel certain I probably could've won against Keith. I don't even know that I have a 50-50 shot against Tina. <br/>Tina: We'll never walk this road again. <br/>Colby: Nope. You ready? Tina: Let's go. It's been great. <br/>Colby: Unbelievable. <br/>Tina: Thank you. For everything. <br/>Colby: Thank you. Rock and roll. Make tracks, don't look back. <br/>Rodger: Well, this is Day 42. The jury is meeting tonight to decide on the final two, and whoever the winner is, I'll certainly go up and shake their hand and give them congratulations, because this game is not an easy game to play out here. I would hope that who ever wins has played the game as morally and as ethically as is physically possible to have done out here in the Outback. And to tell you the truth, I have not made up my mind yet who I'm voting for. <br/>Alicia: You know that this night is going to come, and it all comes down to this. I have a few questions lined up, and I can't wait to hear the responses, which of those two is still on their toes, still thinking, still focused, still has a clear head after everything they've been through. And I can't wait to see who that person is. <br/>Amber: I'm not really liking the feeling at all, the fact that I have the chance right now to give a million dollars to somebody. I just, I hate the feeling, you know, I want the million dollars. It's come down to two very difficult people to choose between. <br/>Keith: Everything they've worked for is coming down to tonight. That's a big deal. That's a lot to think about as they make their way walking to Tribal Council. If you look at Colby, it's obvious that a very strong, competitive, athletic individual that knows how to get along with people can go very far in this game. When I look at Tina, it teaches me that an individual doesn't have to be the strongest to go this far. She won no immunities, she won only one reward, but she just didn't give up. So there's one that didn't win anything, there's one that won almost everything. The common thread is, to believe in yourself, take things day by day, and don't give up. <br/>Nick: The strange part about this game is you try to build friendships and relationships and still play the game and be successful, and it's hard to know whether anybody is genuine. Colby is much more intelligent than I thought he was, he's definitely been more of a thinker in this game than I thought. Tina, I saw as this kind of innocent person just going along with the game, and now I definitely see her as more of a mastermind. I think she's been thinking since day one what she needed to do and she's done it well. <br/>Jerri: I'm in a position of power again, and I like it. So I'm ready to go and vote. The two people that are in the running for a million bucks right now are the two people who backstabbed me about three different separate times. I want them to be forced to look into what they've become in this game, versus who they claim to be in their real lives. <br/>Elisabeth: I would have thought that Colby's competitive nature would have lead him to be voting for Tina last Council. And be up against Keith. He'd have a much cleaner shot, it would seem. Do I think the best person can win? I think there's always that possibility. Will the best person win? Well, that's in the hands of a bunch of people who think they are the best one. So that's the tricky part. <br/>Jeff: We now bring in the So that's the tricky part. <br/>Jeff: We now bring in the final Tribal Council jury. 42 days, and it comes down to final Tribal Council jury. 42 days, and it comes down to this. One final Tribal Council. You guys have endured floods, out of control wildfires, incredible heat, very cold nights and severe hunger. But you're sitting here as the final two because you have mastered human relationships. There's no other way you could end up here. But those who were voted out, our jury, are now in control of your fate. And if the manner in which they were voted out was harsh, payback could be swift and sweet. That's where we're at tonight. There will be one final vote. Before we get to that vote, we're going to have an exchange. Here's how it'll work. We'll start with opening comments from the two of you to the jury, addressing why you deserve the million dollars. The jury then, one by, one will ask a question to you. When they're finished, you'll get a chance to have a closing comment. Then we'll do the vote. Before we start, I just want to poll the jury. Has anybody here shared any information with anyone else in the jury about who they're voting for tonight? <br/>JURY: No. <br/>Jeff: All right. Tina, the floor is yours. <br/>Tina: Strategy played a big part in getting here. The strategy for Survivoris outwit, outplay, outlast. I'm not going to sit here and tell you why you should vote for me. I will say the one thing that I hope that you don't do, is that you don't cast your vote based on that you got your feelings hurt. I think it's poor sportsmanship, and I don't think that it relays who the true survivor is. It just shows that you got your feelings hurt. So it's up to you guys from here on out. It's been a pleasure and a joy. I know whenever I go home, I go home to a husband who treats me like a princess and who I worship and adore, and two children who I'm so happy to be their mom. And that's worth more to me than a million dollars. I wish that for all of you. <br/>Jeff: Colby, the floor is yours. <br/>Colby: Well, I guess we're supposed to make a spiel here about why we deserve a million dollars or why I deserve it over Tina, and I don't know that I do. You've got to be a jack of all trades, but not necessarily a master of any, and that's an old saying that goes way back. I don't think I was necessarily the best at anything, and I don't think I beat Tina in strategy or any elements of the game, but I feel like I did them all pretty good. And that's why I'm here. <br/>Jeff: All right, jury, take a moment. Collect your thoughts. You're going to each have the opportunity to ask Tina and Colby a question that will help you decide who will be the sole survivor. <br/>Jeff: All right. I'll turn it over to the jury. You're free to ask Colby and Tina anything you want. Rodger, we'll start with you. <br/>Rodger: Well, Tina, Colby, a big night for both of you, I know. There's been some times when you have not always told the truth, had to lie on occasions, that's part of the strategy of playing the game. I'd like for both of you maybe to give me a couple of instances where you did not tell the truth, and then do you feel that you have played the game as ethically as you possibly could have? <br/>Tina: Wow. <br/>Jeff: Tina, we'll start with you. <br/>Tina: Okay. I think as far as not telling the truth, for me personally would come in to play whenever someone would come to me, like let's say Amber, because Amber was the one who usually would come to us before every Tribal Council and say, "Okay, who are we voting for?" and at the point that it was Amber's time to go, I, we didn't tell Amber and say, "Okay, Amber, you're the one who's going out tonight." So that would be an incidence of when the truth wasn't told. And as far as ethically is concerned, in playing this game, I don't think you can win it by saying, "Well, you know, that's a nice person I don't want to vote that person off." I think you have to have more of a strategic mind. But I don't feel like that was unethical by any means. And so by my definition, I feel like I've played ethically. <br/>Rodger: Colby? <br/>Colby: Dishonesty. I have one moment that came to mind was when I told Jerri if we went into the merge with the upper hand as far as voting and we took over, that she and Amber and I would take this thing on, and that didn't happen. And that was one point of dishonesty there because I told her that. And as far as ethics go, if being dishonest makes me less ethical, then maybe I had a struggle with ethics on this thing. <br/>Jeff: Amber. <br/>Amber: Well, here we are. My question is: What three things got you to this point? And, if you were to win the million dollars, what are the first three things you're going to do with that million dollars? <br/>Jeff: Colby, we'll start with you. <br/>Colby: First would be the refusal at any point to ever mentally check out of the game, meaning just keeping my head in it the entire time. Strategizing from day one on until day 42. Second thing, water. I mean that was the only thing that kept me from getting hunger pains was fooling my stomach into thinking it was full by filling it with water. Three, taking time out to enjoy. You could have gone mad in this game if you didn't every now and then realize where you were and how lucky we were to be here. And the first three things I'd spend it on, I'd love to buy a Harley Davidson, would die to have one of those. Two, my dad has restored an antique office building that he's going to have to sell because of financial reasons, and I would love to buy that building without him knowing I purchased it, and give it back to him. And also financially take care of my mom. Those three things. <br/>Jeff: Tina? <br/>Tina: The three things that got me here, was strategy. I think Colby, I think he had a big part, I mean last night he could have voted me off but he didn't. So Colby definitely got me here. And the third I'd say heart slash God. And the three things I'd like to do with the million, the first three things is pay off my house, pay off my best friend's house, and Elisabeth gave me a fantastic idea, about setting up a fund, putting money in that fund and the interest that it draws, spend it one time a year for a family that is in need. And I thought that was one of the best ideas I've ever heard. <br/>Amber: Okay. <br/>Jeff: Elisabeth. <br/>Elisabeth: The theme of deserving has woven its way into many Councils. If you had the power to give five of the jury members here before you this million dollar prize, what are the names, no explanation, what are the names of the two that you would exclude from that prize? <br/>Jeff: Tina, we'll start with you. <br/>Tina: Jerri and Rodger. <br/>Jeff: Colby? <br/>Colby: Jerri... and Keith. <br/>Jeff: Keith. <br/>Keith: Well, guys, I've played this game with you for 41 days. I know how political it is and how political it becomes, I also know that manipulation comes into play. Each of you, give me an instance where you used manipulation to get you where you're at right now. <br/>Jeff: Colby. <br/>Colby: When Tina and I, on the way to Tribal Council, decided to vote Mitchell off and break an alliance, thus manipulating the whole setting, to first get the team to the merge stronger, thus getting me farther in the game. <br/>Jeff: Tina. <br/>Tina: I would say the exact same thing. Like Colby, I knew that if we made the decision to vote you off and keep Mitchell, that it made our team weaker. You can call it manipulation if you want to, I prefer to call it strategy. <br/>Jeff: Alicia. <br/>Alicia: It's nice to see you guys and I want to congratulate you both on a job well done. A lot of things have happened. I'm sure there's a lot of things that you both probably would like to forget and a lot of things you never want to forget. And in light of that, I have a two-part question for you. What I want to know is, what one particular thing are you personally most proud of, and on the flip side of that, least proud of personally. <br/>Jeff: Tina. <br/>Tina: I think I am most proud of maybe the role I've played here. There are some things that I did as a tribe member that I felt like were extremely giving. Such as giving Keith the immunity challenge when we were standing on those poles. My least proud moment... would be probably every Tribal Council. Whenever I had to vote somebody off, I never felt good about doing that. <br/>Colby: Uh... least proud moment is probably today, for the first time realizing how little respect I've shown this land where we are. I mean, my head has been in the game so much, I realized today how little I've stopped to smell the roses, and I wasn't very proud of that because it's taken it for granted. Um... my most proud moment was just a very, very simple few seconds when I won an immunity challenge, filling the water buckets up simply, because I was in dead last at the beginning of that challenge, and I remember telling myself, if you dig deep on this, if you dig as deep as you can go, you can pull this thing off, and that was a proud moment for me. <br/>Alicia: Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Nick. <br/>Nick: First I want to say I think you guys have both played a hell of a game. And, uh... I have a lot of respect for both of you. After you guys gave me the boot, um, there was a lot of talk of the following Tribal Councils about people deserving to be around, which is interesting to me because had it not been for a very unfortunate accident, then in all likelihood, neither of you two would be sitting here right now. So, my question is this: If Mike had never had his accident, who would be sitting in your place, which two people, and why? <br/>Jeff: Colby. <br/>Colby: This is gonna sound like a lot of schmooze, but one of those two people I think would be you. And I don't know what happened before the merge, but I know when we came together, you had the mental game going and were ready to take it on to the end. Uh, and seeing the way Mike helped you guys out in just about every... every, uh... challenge we faced, you know, I mean I don't know the guy, but I'd say he had a pretty good shot of being in the end, too. I mean, obviously, we'll never know, but I think if we went into the merge different, and you guys had the upper hand, I'd say it's probably going to be you two guys. <br/>Jeff: TINA. <br/>Tina: Because I didn't really get a chance to know you all that well and to get the dynamics of what went on, I really can't answer that question. I do think that the way that you all described him and some of the actions that he took, there's probably no doubt in my mind that Mike would be one of the people sitting up here. <br/>Jeff: Jerri. <br/>Jerri: During the course of this game, you have had to make and break promises, you've had to manipulate. I want to allow you to clear your conscience by bringing up any moments during the course of this game that you might have felt some sense of guilt, remorse or regret for something you might have done to another person. <br/>Jeff: Tina. <br/>Tina: I think one of the things, or thething that I feel worse about, was the day that we came back to the Ogakor tribe, and Kel had been accused of eating the beef jerky. And someone said, "Well, check his bags," and I was standing there by his bag and opening up the bag to look in there to see if we saw beef jerky wrappers. Afterwards I thought: Oh, I wish I hadn't been standing there and I wish that hadn't been me. And so, that's the one thing that I feel worst about. <br/>Jeff: Colby. <br/>Colby: I think guilt... guilty would be the word that I would use for a couple of instances. I feel guilty about, um... Rodger and Elisabeth. I wish there was a way strategically that we could have played differently. And Alicia. You know, there were a lot of reasons for voting off a lot of people, but Alicia was the first one I volleyed on to go, and it was simply based on her being a physical threat, and I think... I think that's shallow as hell, and I feel guilty about that. But I don't, I don't have any regrets. I feel guilty about a lot of things, but... but I don't have any regrets. <br/>Jeff: I'm going to give you guys both a chance to address them one last time. Colby, last words. <br/>Colby: Not a lack of respect to anyone, but I... I don't have any. <br/>Jeff: Tina, last words. <br/>Tina: When you play backgammon, like we played countless games of backgammon together, you don't go into backgammon and say, "Okay, I'm going to leave this man open." You know, you have to cover that man; that's the strategy. And it's the same thing with this game. There was never anything personal about voting anybody off. There was a strategy. And that's all it is. <br/>Jeff: All right. You've had a chance to ask your questions, gather your information. Now it's in your hands. So, take a moment to consider whether it's gonna be Colby or Tina, who leaves the outback one million dollars richer. <br/>Jeff: It's now time for our final vote. Normally at Tribal Council, you're voting against someone, you're voting somebody out of the tribe. Tonight it's flip-flopped. Tonight you are voting for somebody. You guys are going to be writing down the name of the person you think deserves the million dollars. Rodger, we'll start with you. <br/>Rodger: This was a very,  Rodger: This was a very, very, very tough decision for me. I like both people; I think they both have played the game extremely well. I do, however, think that Colby probably played the game a little harder; I just think he has turned out to be the ultimate survivor in this... in this game. <br/>Alicia: Let me just say that in the game of life, Colby would be the one I would probably most likely gravitate to. But this is the game of Survivor. And I think Tina is more deserving because she has really played this game. It wasn't winning seven or eight challenges that got her here. It was strategy and using her head. She's a smart woman. And I think she deserves it. <br/>Amber: Tina, you... From 42 days, you haven't received a vote yet, but you won't be receiving your first vote from me. Uh, Colby gets my vote tonight. I feel that Colby was more straightforward with me and, uh, played the game better. So, Colby, you win this. Congratulations, buddy. <br/>Jerri: It's been very clear to me from the very beginning that Tina, you have been the mastermind behind all of the strategies that have taken place, and your greatest strategy of all was getting Colby to pick you over Keith, to be sitting where you're sitting right now. So, I can't help but have a great sense of respect for that. <br/>Jeff: I'll go get the votes. <br/>Jeff: Inside this container are seven votes. It's a culmination of 42 days in the Outback. For one of you, the votes inside this container represent $100,000 prize. But for the other person, the votes inside here represent a million-dollar prize. And the title of Survivor: The Australian Outback. I know you've waited a long time for this moment, and you're gonna wait a little longer. These votes will be sealed and revealed live when we return to the United States. I'll see all of you there. That's all. [ helicopter approaching] [ applause and cheers] [ applause and cheers] [ applause and cheers]  Colby: Whoo! Yeah! [ applause continuing]  Colby: Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Yes! <br/>Tina: You know... [ applause ceases]  Jeff: Well, this is pretty cool, huh? [ Colby whooping, Tina laughing]  Jeff: We are a far cry from the world we left behind so long ago, the Australian Outback. Beautiful but very harsh terrain, great wildlife and just truly an organic nature for the 42 days you guys spent out there. To this very surreal and yet still authentic, new Survivor world, where a very dramatic conclusion is gonna play out to a great game. You guys have waited a long time. We're gonna get to the votes in mere moments, I promise you. I've got to ask: You've had a long time to think about this night. I'm imagining a lot of anxiousness, maybe one or two sleepless nights of anticipation. Now that we're here at this moment of truth, what is coursing through your body and your brain? Colby, you just took a... sort of a deep breath there. What's this feel like? <br/>Colby: I think that's the first breath I've taken in two hours. Uh-oh. [ laughter] I don't... I... Jeff, I don't know. I don't know that I can put it into words right now, but I'm anxious. This is... this is the way it should be. <br/>Jeff: How about you, Tina? You... The whole time out there, you were very calm, close to the chest. You... you look that way now. You're very subdued. <br/>Tina: I'm very emotional. We've been watching backstage and just crying. And I feel so close to everybody here, and I think that's one thing that's so special between all of us is that no matter what happens tonight, we leave a close-knit group. <br/>Jeff: You know, one of the great things I think anyway about Survivor is that it offers you perspective. I mean, how often do you get a chance where you get to have 16 strangers together who are going to ultimately give you their opinion, what they think about you, how you play, how you interact socially, who you are as a person? And then you get to watch it play out, learn what they think about you and also view yourself and maybe gain some new insight into your own self-perception. Had we read these votes in Australia moments after the jury cast them, you'd have no chance for reflection. It happened immediately. You've had a lot of time for reflection. As you watch that final day and the final Tribal Council play out, any second-guessing going on about how you played it? Any Monday morning quarterbacking, "I wish I'd have..."? Tina? <br/>Tina: Not for me. I think that there's so many things that come into playing this game, part of it's luck, part of it's strategy, you know. So, there are so many things that could have happened that would have swung the other way and I would not be sitting here. And I feel like, as far as I'm concerned, I did what I could to get here. And the rest of it was luck. <br/>Jeff: How about you, Colby? <br/>Colby: Well, I... It was no shocker that I didn't get Jerri's vote on that, but I realize now I should have sucked up to Alicia a little more. That one threw me by surprise. But no. I'm just... man, let's get it on. I'm excited. <br/>Jeff: You guys, Keith made an interesting point, he said, "You know, you both bring such different strategies and strengths to this and yet you find yourself, both of you, in the final two." And I really sensed, especially in the last day, a true camaraderie. Bond still strong between you guys, as you sit here knowing only one is going to win? <br/>Tina: Incredible. <br/>Colby: Absolutely. And man, that's the neat thing. I don't care how many Survivors you have, you'll never be able to predict who the winner's going to be because there are so many dynamics involved. And it doesn't matter how dominant you are either physically or strategically, it doesn't matter when it all plays out. That's what matters. I mean that's... there are so many elements, and that's what's fun, that's what's exciting about this. <br/>Jeff: Let's get to the vote. <br/>Colby: Let's do it. <br/>Jeff: Jury, I just want to make sure nobody in the jury has revealed to anyone else the vote you made that night. JURY: No. Jeff: You don't know, you don't know. Seven votes inside here. That means that, in a moment, somebody's going to leave this stage with, among other things, a Pontiac Aztec, which Colby, would be a matching one for you to go with the first one you won out there. Also, the last remaining item from Camp Barramundi, the Survivor flag. You guys made a deal when you said, you know, what, winner takes it. A great reminder of the high highs and the very low lows, and I'm happy to report it still has just enough aroma that it will take you right back there. You'll also leave the stage with a check in the amount of $1 million. Runner-up gets $100,000. And maybe, now looking back on the last 42 days, maybe the most coveted thing, the winner earns the title of Survivor: the Australian Outback,and well deserved. So with that, seven votes, takes four to win. Remember, in this final vote, you want your name on this parchment. The jury did not vote somebody out. They voted for a winner. Take a deep breath. Let's read the votes. This is good. First vote. Tina. Two votes Tina. It takes four votes to win. Third vote, Colby. Two votes Tina, one vote Colby. Colby. That's two votes Tina, two votes Colby. Three votes Colby, two votes Colby. Three votes Colby, two votes Tina. One more vote, Colby and it's yours. <br/>Tina: Told you. <br/>Jeff: It doesn't get any better than this. Three votes Tina, three votes Colby. In true Survivor tradition, it comes down to one final vote. The winner of Survivor: The Australian Outback...  Colby: Yeah! Yeah! [ cheers and applause] Come here! Whoo! Yeah! Tina: Thank you, Jeff. Oh, my gosh. <br/>Jeff: Come on over, guys. I'll give this to you, Tina.
