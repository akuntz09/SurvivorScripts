<br/> Jeff: Previously on  "Survivor." younger tribe wins immunity! Younger tribe wins immunity and reward! The older tribe had lost two of three challenges and struggled at camp. <br/>That was going to  work if it didn't hit my foot. <br/>We have no food and  no means of getting it. <br/>Jeff: But none of  this phased Marty who was practically giddy about being the undisputed tribe  zvengali. <br/>Those that want to  play with me, jump on board. Do not mess around with me. I mean, I'm playing this game for real. <br/>Jeff: At the younger  tribe, Brenda was the mastermind. <br/>I have people on my  side without doing anything. <br/>Jeff: And her ally, NaOnka,  was the camp bully. Naonka's main target was Kelly B., the tribe mate with the artificial leg. She knocked her down and yelled at her. <br/>I don't like you,  never have liked you. <br/>Naonka's psycho. Kelly b. Never did anything to nay. Never. <br/>Stop! <br/>Jeff: Older tribe in  complete disarray. When the older tribe lost yet another challenge... Younger tribe wins  immunity and reward! Jimmy t. Nominated himself to be leader. <br/>I've been successful  in the past, and I can be successful in the future. <br/>He wanted to get rid  of Dan and Holly and Jane agreed. <br/>I think the only  person that might be in Danger would be Danny. <br/>Jeff: But jimmy's  politicking challenged Marty's ego. <br/>I'd like to tell Marty,  you preppy little bitch, you wouldn't last a minute in my world. <br/>Jeff: At tribal  council, Marty lobbied hard against Jimmy T. <br/>There is zero  tolerance for paranoia, delusions of grandeur. <br/>Jeff: And it worked. Jimmy t., the tribe has spoken. Now Holly and Jane are in deep trouble. 16 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Marty, what do you  need help with? <br/>I think we're just  loading up the fire, some kind of substantial pieces. <br/>I had no idea that Jimmy  T. Was going tonight at tribal council. I was shocked. <br/>Jimmy t.'s a good guy. <br/>He's a really good  guy. <br/>He's a good guy. I don't think he has the easiest life. I think he's... You know what I'm saying? I think he works hard. Most of the people that I talked to said they were going to vote for the  weakest link. I mean, let's face it, physically, Jimmy T. Could do hand stands over Danny. And they're keeping the tribe strong? It does upset me. I'm on the outs and I know that something has to change. <br/>Tribal council last  night was a slam dunk. Jimmy t. Was voted off. So you can't get cocky in this game, but I'm in control finally. I'm in control of this tribe. So we're good, man. We're good for minimum two to three more tribals. If you can see two tribals ahead in this game, that's pretty good, and if you  can see it with the level of certainty that I have, even better. Jane and Holly, they're going to have to go. It would take something extraordinary, off the charts, completely whacked out  to disturb my plans now. <br/>I'm so proud to be on  my young tribe. I mean, we're the bomb. My solid five right now is myself and Purple Kelly, Brenda, Chase, and Sash. We are controlling this entire game right now. Kelly b. And Alina are the ones that are up to get voted out. I have it all planned in my head, I already see the win. We got the tarp, I have the hidden immunity idol. Got my hair done, got my shoes clean, got the new fit. You know, I got my swag. If I look good, I feel good, I'm going to do good. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys. Younger tribe getting your first look at the new older tribe. Jimmy t. Voted out at the last tribal council. <br/>Marty looks rough. <br/>Jeff: You guys ready  to get to it for today? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: All right. Drop your buffs. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>Jeff: We are  switching tribes. <br/>I'm going to cry  right now. <br/>Jeff: I see a lot of  shocked faces, Marty. <br/>Hey, listen,  anything's possible in this game. I was definitely not counting on this. Not now. Too early. <br/>Jeff: Jud, the look  on your face captured a moment of shock. <br/>Oh, man, we were on  such a roll. We just wanted to keep winning and now everything is back up in the air. <br/>Jeff: All right. We are going to draw for new captains. You're going to reach in and take a rock. Don't look. Jud doesn't even want to draw. And one for you, Jill. Keeping your palms closed, turn them face up. Here we go, reveal. If you have a yellow rock, you're a captain. If you have a blue rock, you are a captain. Brenda and Holly are the captains. Take a spot right here. All right, Brenda, you're going to choose three people from the older tribe  to join you. These people will be on your tribe. To even things up, Holly, you're going to pick four members from the younger  tribe to join you. You done? All right, take a spot back on your tribes. From the older tribe, joining the younger tribe: Jane, Jill and Marty. From the younger tribe joining the older tribe: Alina, Benry, Chase, and NaOnka. Switch tribes. <br/>Hey, guys. <br/>Hey, everybody. <br/>Hi. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Benry. <br/>Welcome. How are you doing? <br/>Jeff: Here are your  new buffs. Younger tribe no more, you are now La Flor. Older tribe no more. You are now Espada. Put them on. <br/>Oh, my God, they're  clean. <br/>Jeff: Old versus  young is done. Medallion of power, done. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: It is a  brand-new game. It is La Flor wearing yellow versus Espada wearing blue. Naonka, what do you think of your new tribe? <br/>It's kind of hard  because I'm away from my family and we got really close and I'm going to miss  you guys. <br/>Jeff: Marty, still  early in this game. What do you make of this new tribe? <br/>Listen, how can you  argue with winning, right? These guys have been winning, winning, winning. It's going to feel good to be with the winning tribe and I got a sneaking  suspicion that camp's going to be kind of plush. <br/>Jeff: All right. You guys ready to get to your first challenge as new tribes? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: It's for reward. Here's how it works. Two members of each tribe will throw a ball that will roll down a wall and  bounce and change direction along the way. Two members of the other tribe must work together to catch those balls. If a ball hits the ground, the other tribe scores a point. That round is over. We bring in the next pairs. First tribe to score three wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh, baby, oh, baby,  oh, baby! <br/>Jeff: Two chickens,  one rooster. Worth playing for? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Wring that neck on  that chicken! <br/>Jeff: All right, give  you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. Here we go. For reward, we are playing to three. Survivors ready? Go. <br/>Go Espada! <br/>Let's go, guys! <br/>Jeff: Benry and Chase  catching for Espada. Marty and Sash for La Flor. You've got to catch these balls. If you drop, the other tribe scores. <br/>Got it, Marty! <br/>Jeff: Marty with a  great grab. <br/>Let's go, Chase! <br/>Get it! <br/>Jeff: Sash drops for La  Flor. Espada scores first point! Next group out. Survivors ready? Go. It's Tyrone and Alina catching for Espada. Jud and Jill catching for La Flor. Good catch by Alina. Tyrone catches one. Fabio and Jill working together. Nice catches. <br/>Great job, guys! <br/>Jeff: Holly can't get  it up the wall, costing her tribe time. Tyrone drops for Espada. La flor scores! We are tied 1-1. Next pair back in. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Get it, girl, get it! <br/>Focus, guys, focus! <br/>Get them! That's right! Get them! Get 'em! <br/>Marty, get that! All right! <br/>I got it! <br/>Jeff: Marty drops for  La Flor. Espada scores and leads 2-1. <br/>Way to be, way to be! <br/>Jeff: Next pair, Survivors  ready? Go. Espada can win it right here. La flor would like to tie it up here. Fabio and Jill with a strategy. One short, one deep. Tyrone with a good catch. Alina with a good catch. Jill with a nice grab. Tyrone with another one. Got a great rally going. <br/>Fabio, Jill, you guys  got it. <br/>Jeff: Fabio with a  catch. Alina drops for Espada. We are tied. 2-2. We are playing to three. You can't ask for better than this. First challenge as new tribes, and it's going all the way. Survivors ready? Go! The winner of this point, two chickens, one rooster and a big message to the  other tribe. <br/>Perfect! Perfect, nay! <br/>Move in. I got this side. <br/>Come on, Marty! <br/>Got it, Marty? <br/>Jeff: Oh, Marty with  a nice save! <br/>Oh! <br/>Go, get it! <br/>Jeff: Marty drops for  La Flor. Espada wins reward! <br/>That was good! <br/>That was so good! <br/>Jeff: Espada,  congratulations. Come get your reward. <br/>All right. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Bye, fam. <br/>Good job. <br/>Jeff: All right, La  Flor, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. <br/>Welcome home, Espada! <br/>Good job, welcome,  man! Today we got new people in the tribe. <br/>Benry, nice to meet  you. <br/>If I had it my way, I  would have loved to stay with the old tribe because I think we had a good  little machine going. But another dynamic is that you have a little pretty girls running around and  there may be some flirtation going on. <br/>We got some chickens. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Sure, we got to talk  about that, too. I say we keep the chicken alive for a little while because that's going to  produce eggs. I don't know the rate they produce eggs. Sit down, take a load off, relax, guys. We got all day. I think we got a pretty good system. The machete, we try to keep the machete right there so if anybody's looking  for it and if anybody takes it just yell out because somebody else might be  looking. Here's another thing, when you leave, come back with a piece of wood. That way it's organized, you know what I mean? <br/>Tyrone is definitely  the leader of this tribe, and as soon as we came in here he started telling  us this goes here and this goes here and you've got to do this and you got to  do that. And it's very older tribe. <br/>We try to keep stuff  as clean as possible. If we eat something, we try to clean the bowl out, rinse it out. <br/>In La Flor we didn't  have any rules and I think that now you got Tyrone right now, Tyrone... He's  trying to tell everybody what to do. <br/>We'll do what we've  been doing. Don't change nothing, pretty much. <br/>Don't think you a  g.-- which is a gangster-- because you're not. <br/>You two remind me of  my son, our son. And you remind me of my youngest daughter. So I was like, okay. <br/>Perfect. <br/>Where are you from? <br/>South dakota. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>Good hunting there. <br/>Yeah, there's very  good hunting. This switch had been phenomenal for me. I feel like I relate to the kids well. Coming back, the kids were very receptive to me, so just hope that I can some  way or another keep them and tell them that I'm honest to them. <br/>I love your energy. <br/>Yeah? I know I... That's what my kids always say, too. They're like "Mom, you can do thing things with us." You're upbeat. <br/>Good. I feel a connection with both of you guys, so that's good, good. <br/>That's good. <br/>I think I have a  better chance at going farther at this point with the kids than I do with Dan,  eve and td. So, strategically, if the kids come to me with an idea, 100% I'm onboard. I don't know what you guys feel. How did you guys go over there? <br/>I don't feel like  I've lost anything leaving. <br/>Perfect. <br/>I feel the same way. <br/>I didn't either  because I was with Jane and I didn't feel like I was in with everybody else  and they were... And it came out in the vote last night. <br/>You lost Jane and you  gained us. <br/>That's true. <br/>So that's numbers. <br/>There's only four of  us here with four of Espada. <br/>Let's hang together,  guys, okay? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Thanks. <br/>And Holly wants to  team up with us. We'll have the numbers to five. I'm going to go wherever the numbers go. It's pretty ironic that Alina and myself got pulled over to Espada. Alina and I's relationship has changed a whole bunch. So this is our home now and we have to make do with what we have. <br/>Happy to have you  over here. <br/>We have room for  everyone. <br/>This is so exciting. <br/>The old switcheroo. I was pretty stoked on how it worked out, actually. I was dreading the switc h because I felt comfortable in the original La Flor  tribe. But the way it worked out was pretty right on. We picked up Marty, Jill and Jane. We're all super cool and numbers wise La Flor tribe are 5-3, it looks good. <br/>It will be good to  find out how you guys do stuff so we don't step on people's toes. We had protocol for who took care of fire and water and how we did that stuff  so... We have to work in  this camp. No one ever sat down. Up 5:30 a.M. <br/>No slackers at all. So you guys, like, gather firewood as a team sort of everyday or... Laid back; we don't  like trouble. <br/>Well, I like these  kids. I mean, they kind of think like me, and they seem to be more relaxed, whereas  my tribe was all about schedule, schedule, schedule. <br/>They sit around and  chatterbox and have tea. I would have voted Marty and Jill out a long time ago if I could have got an  alliance because Marty and Jill have been tight as ticks. One humping the other one on the back. I'm telling you. <br/>I was guessing you  guys have had a shot at immunity idols. <br/>I haven't seen it. It was in the fruit basket. We got in here, we were all excited and then NaOnka shoves Kelly B. And just goes for the clue and gets it and then walks down here to read it. <br/>She didn't share it  with everybody? <br/>No. <br/>I would have thought  that would have been kind of sin that you would never forgive, you know? To have somebody... I don't know, man. We're the young tribe. I guess we don't really know what we're doing. I don't know. <br/>It doesn't seem to me  like this tribe has had a lot of leadership and, frankly, at Espada, I got  control of that entire tribe and not necessarily by being a leader but by  being a player. Fabio just told me that somebody just pushed somebody aside, ran off with the  clue to the idol and you guys let that fly. Come on, guys. That would be, like, cancer in a tribe. <br/>We had serious  issues, like... I'm going to tell you  guys the way I played the game and Jill will say the same, too. I haven't had to lie to anybody, do anything that's been back stabbing so I  want to get off on the right foot with you guys. I have an immunity idol. <br/>Yeah? <br/>There you go. <br/>Whoa! That's awesome. <br/>Right on. <br/>I thought it was  really important to show I had the idol. I knew that Jane would probably tell them I had it so why not play it up  front and try to get something out of it. We shared the clue, everybody read it. That's why I'm surprised you guys... Okay, oh, okay. <br/>If one person had  taken the clue, I don't know, I would have tackled them. I would have clubbed them over the head. <br/>I wanted to. <br/>I think Marty is so  arrogant. He just whipped out the immunity idol. You know, "Okay, no b.S., I have the idol." and we're sitting  there, like, wow, so impressed! But in our heads we're like, are you stupid? He's coming into our home, and he's already setting up like he's the king. <br/>Wow! <br/>Is that a key? <br/>He has a lot of balls. That's the dumbest thing he could have done. Hello? <br/>Every time you think  days can't get worse here, they get worse. Can't even get the heat from the fire with these winds. <br/>We need to get some  wood in there now. <br/>The resources around  this camp are definitely slim. They built that shelter right off the ocean. We're getting a crazy wind. They've got a high roof and there's no shortage of rain here today. And, you know, it doesn't look like there's any sign of stopping. <br/>Rain's gonna stop. It's got to stop eventually. <br/>Hang in there, baby,  it's going to blow over. <br/>This rain out here is  hideous. I just don't like the rain and I'm just worried about, like, my head. Because when I'm cold and I'm not really doing too well I lose it. This weather is the worst. It's killing me. I'm hurting. Like really bad. <br/>I know. <br/>You know it deep down. Naonka seems like a high school girl. She's irrational and crazy and she just seems like she's on her period all  the time. Rain is not that big of a deal here. We're on a beach. We're wet anyway. I mean, who cares. But I'm actually, like, relishing in it. Just keep checking out. It's better for me if you want to go home because that's just one less person  I have to battle against. <br/>I'm glad she chose us  but I'm, like, damn. <br/>I know, we could be  under a tarp. I keep thinking the same thing. <br/>We worked so hard to  get it, and it was just stripped from us. <br/>Because it's wet and  I have no clothes. <br/>You have the rest of  your life to be warm and comfortable. <br/>I know. God. Oh, I just want this to stop. <br/>I'm scared. <br/>You're scared of what? <br/>I don't want to leave. <br/>You're not gonna do  that, trust us. You were trying to convince her not to. Come here. Hey, seriously. <br/>This is a little  storm right here. It will be all right. <br/>Yes. <br/>The day that my dad  died, I was driving home, it was raining the whole drive and... I swear I  looked in my rear-view mirror and then the damn back of my truck... Like in  the bed of my truck, it looked like a rainbow was right there. And then I turned around, and I didn't see anything. We'll be all right. We'll make it through. This ain't nothing. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys. Marty, had a few days with your new tribe. Feeling camaraderie? <br/>It's easy to feel  camaraderie when you here in the taj mahal of camps. <br/>Jeff: So, Jane, life  got a lot better for you with the switch. <br/>Oh, yeah, honey. Being dry was great. <br/>Jeff: Alina, opposite  for you? Did you go from good to bad? <br/>I wouldn't say we  went to bad, but we bonded in a different way and it's because we were wet instead  of dry. <br/>Jeff: Guys ready to  get to today's challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: First things  first, I'll take back immunity. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, three members of each tribe will be strapped to a  large wheel. Three other tribe members will spin the wheel, temporarily causing their  tribe mates to go underwater. While submerged, you'll try to take in a mouthful of water that you will then  spit into a small bowl which feeds a tube. Once the tube fills up, a ball will be released. The two remaining tribe members will use the ball to break tiles. First tribe to break all five tiles wins immunity, is safe from the vote,  losers go to tribe council where the fifth person will be voted out of this  game. I'll give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. <br/>Jeff: On the wheel  for La Flor, we have Kelly B., Purple Kelly and Brenda. On the wheel for Espada, we have Alina, Holly, and Yve. Survivors ready? Go. <br/>Let's go, Espada. <br/>Jeff: Going  underwater trying to take in water and then spit it out. Holly gets a little in. Brenda gets a little in. There's definitely a learning curve to this challenge. <br/>Yeah, do it, girl! <br/>Jeff: Brenda with a  nice bit of water. <br/>Yeah, Yve! <br/>Get in the bowl! Get in the bowl! <br/>Good job! <br/>Come on, girls! Come on, girls! <br/>Jeff: Sash, Jill, Marty  spinning for La Flor. Dan, NaOnka, Chase spinning for Espada. <br/>Slow down a little. <br/>Jeff: Espada really  slowing down. La flor's moving twice as fast as Espada. <br/>Get in there, Alina. Good job! <br/>Come on, ladies! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Brenda with  another nice job. <br/>Faster! <br/>Slow it down a little  bit. <br/>Jeff: Espada going  even slower now, trying a different strategy and it's working. La flor spinning fast but they're missing their bowl. <br/>Slow it down a little  bit! <br/>Slow us down! <br/>Yeah, Holly! <br/>Jeff: We're very  close, Espada with a bit of a lead. La flor you need more water. <br/>Spit harder, girls! Slow it down, La Flor! <br/>Almost there! Almost there! Yeah! <br/>Come on, there you  go, girl. <br/>Jeff: Espada getting  very close. Espada releases their ball. Tyrone and Benry now breaking tiles for Espada. <br/>Come on! <br/>We're done, we're  done, we're done. Get her up, get her up. 12:00, 12:00, 12:00. <br/>Come on, girls! <br/>Jeff: Purple Kelly  with a nice job. Kelly b. With a nice job. La flor releases their ball. Tyrone breaks the first tile Espada. <br/>Stop it. <br/>Right here. <br/>Stop! Stop! Stop! Whoa, guys! <br/>Let's go, Jane. <br/>Okay, broke that one. <br/>Jeff: La Flor breaks  their first tile. <br/>Let's go Espada, we  got this. <br/>Benry, you talk, man. <br/>Jeff: We are tied 1-1. There are five tiles to break. Immunity on the line. Fabio connects for La Flor. <br/>Benry, you got this. <br/>Jeff: Benry connects  for Espada. We're tied 2-2. <br/>Go, go, go, guys! <br/>Go, Fabio! <br/>Jeff: Fabio hits  again for La Flor. Benry just misses. La flor now leads 3-2. There are five total. <br/>Come on, Jane! <br/>Jane connects for La  Flor. La flor has one tile left. <br/>One more! <br/>Benry! <br/>Jeff: Benry trying to  get it back in for Espada. Benry connects for Espada! It's four tiles La Flor, three Espada. Benry breaks the fourth tile for Espada. We are tied. <br/>Come on, Fabio. <br/>You can do it, Fabio. <br/>Jeff: Fabio can win  it for La Flor right here. <br/>That's it. <br/>Jeff: Just misses. <br/>Benry, you finish it,  dude. <br/>Come on, Benry! <br/>Jeff: This could do  it. <br/>Fabio! <br/>Jeff: Fabio wins it  for La Flor! <br/>Yeah, baby. Yes! <br/>Jeff: Well, Espada  wins first reward but La Flor wins first immunity. La flor, congratulations. Nobody going home from your tribe. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. Espada, new tribe, same result. Tribal council once again tonight. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. I will see you at tribal. <br/>I knew that we were  going to lose. I felt it. And, you know, I'm not a quitter and I don't want my students to think I'm a  quitter but... I'm just getting skinnier and I'm losing fat and I think I'm  done. I really do think I'm done. <br/>We lost the challenge  today and I believe that Espada is cursed because how you gonna get the pick  of the litter and you're still losing? We're going to tribal council tonight. It's crazy but I'm not nervous at all about tribal. I made it this far. If I continue going, kudos to me. But I don't care. I really want to go home. I'm over it. <br/>I want to eat before  tribal. <br/>But what do we have  to eat? <br/>I want to eat one of  those mothers. <br/>What do you do break  the neck or cut its head off? <br/>We're thinking we need  to break it. <br/>We're gonna break  this chicken's neck. <br/>That's consensus? Are we going with that? I mean, if that's what y'all want to do. I disagree with it, but... You do? <br/>Yeahm because I think  we're cutting down our egg production. <br/>One egg a day, though. <br/>That's just my take  on it. <br/>It seems like  everybody wanted to eat the chicken except for Tyrone. You know, sometimes it is hard to go against Tyrone. Tyrone is a little intimidating, but I think we need to start standing up to Tyrone. <br/>I'm thinking keep it. <br/>We can vote on it,  that's all. <br/>I'm down to killing  and eat one today. <br/>Kill. Kill it. <br/>If I had it my way I  say we keep the chicken but we're going to kill one for immediate  gratification and after that we're going to be hungry again. But I'm not going against it and just say "No, that ain't  happening." it wouldn't be smart to rock the boat right now. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Are you serious? <br/>I noticed as we were  cleaning the chicken and as we were boiling the chicken, Tyrone, he stayed in  the background because it wasn't his way, instead of pitching in. But as soon as it was time to eat the chicken, he was right there. Oh, does that look good. <br/>That looks pretty  delicious. <br/>Just have everybody  take some. What do you guys think? <br/>We had plenty of food  for everybody and everybody took a mediocre regular size portion. Meanwhile you have Tyrone in the corner just feasting and it was very  blatantly obvious that he had gotten more chicken than the rest of the tribe  so he's becoming more and more obnoxious by the day. <br/>But look out for your  neighbor. Look out for your neighbor. <br/>Tyrone's, you know,  granted, he's a very physical player and he could benefit us in some  challenges in one way or another, but he's not the easiest guy to be on the  same tribe with so I think that cutting him loose tonight would absolutely  bring us closer together, but it worries me a bit. Naonka is hanging on by a thread. She's struggling. She almost threw the red flag last night, and she's not doing too well. I don't know if she's all there mentally right now. <br/>What's the sentiment  on your side? <br/>Nay's not in this  mentally. <br/>For someone who  obviously knows that she's, like, on the chopping block, she's not really  politicking a lot. So she might be kind of, like, looking forward to it. As of now that's what we're kind of thinking because we want to keep the  tribe strong. <br/>I want to keep the  tribe strong. <br/>Everyone at camp is  aware that NaOnka has had a rough couple days. It's not going to be a big deal. We're going to have to send nay home. We should be happy we have Holly. Myself, Chase, Benry and Holly, we're definitely in control of this game so  we have to do decide who goes home, Tyrone or NaOnka. I mean, I'm just going to have to see what everybody else wants to do. <br/>Jeff: Alina. Been together with this new tribe three days. Tell me about the dynamics. How's everybody getting along? <br/>Um, coming together,  it was nice at the beginning, obviously. But the fact of the matter is the old La Flor tribe, we lived the way we  lived, we had the way we did things, so there's a little bit of turf wars. Now that we're on Espada's turf, we kind of have to go with their rules. <br/>Jeff: Benry, tell me  about leadership. You've got four people from the young tribe, four people from the older tribe. <br/>Yeah. Tyrone seems to be the boss man around Espada. He's got an assertive personality, a loud voice, and what he says usually  goes. <br/>Jeff: Tyrone? <br/>Sir? <br/>Jeff: What comes with  being the leader of this tribe? <br/>It's a huge  responsibility because people look to you for answers, insight and wisdom so  to speak. <br/>Jeff: Do you feel  qualified? <br/>Yeah, I definitely  feel qualified to be a leader of this tribe. <br/>Jeff: Are you happy  being the leader? <br/>Yeah, I embrace the  position. Basically when I lead, I take input from others. I don't make unilateral decisions, so it's interesting that Alina said there  were turf wars. Maybe we can address them because I want it to be as smooth as it can be for  all parties involved. <br/>Jeff: Well, now's a  good time to address them. Alina, you want to share with Tyrone what turf wars you're referring to? <br/>Just when we came  into camp, it was really like a speech. Like this is how this goes. We've been surviving, too. <br/>Jeff: So you felt a  little like a child? <br/>A little bit like a  child. <br/>Jeff, I just want to  interject, I'm not sure how they did it at La Flor, but all I was trying to  do was introduce them. It would be different if I was laying down the law. So that wasn't my intent, if it was received that way. I guess maybe that's the generation gap, you know. So I don't know. <br/>Jeff: Alina, what's  been the toughest day out here so far? <br/>I think it's the  nights that are tough. Especially last two nights. They were really rainy. Everybody was drenched and it was cold. I think that's the toughest part to get through. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka, what  has been the darkest storm for you? <br/>Oh, my gosh. Ultimately it was last night. I was freezing. I was shaking. I never thought that it was gonna be this difficult for me. <br/>Jeff: Compare it. What's the most difficult thing you've done in life up until now? <br/>Getting a divorce at  26, 27. That's been the hardest thing for me. <br/>Jeff: And what was  difficult about that? <br/>Blaming myself, that  I was probably the one that messed it up. And that was tough. And I couldn't shield myself from that particular storm. Here I have a support system and I have a safety net. And I didn't have that when I was going through the divorce. <br/>Jeff: That's got to  blow your mind a bit. These are strangers competing against you for a million dollars and you  receive more love from them than you did in your most personal relationship. <br/>I sure did. And it was tough for me to open up and tell them but they had a lot of  encouraging words. <br/>Jeff: So it sounds  like this was a monumental night. You're comparing it to the worst time in your life. <br/>I almost was ready to  give up. <br/>Jeff: Meaning you  were wanting to quit? <br/>I wanted to quit. I wanted to quit because it got that tough. It was not 24 hours in that day, it was 26 but it felt like 48. I was at my breaking point yesterday. <br/>Jeff: Benry, when you  see NaOnka clearly struggling, there has to be a nurturing part of you  wanting to comfort her. As a competitor, see ya. <br/>What do you mean, exactly? <br/>Jeff: I don't believe  you don't know. We're here at tribal council. Nobody wants to be voted. There's a woman saying "I'll go. No chance my name gets written down tonight." Yve, do you know what I'm  talking about? <br/>I think I do. <br/>Jeff: You think you  do? <br/>Well, all right, I do. When I see nay start breaking down mentally, in my head I don't see longevity  there and I start questioning it, I do. Why are you here if you're starting to break down? Am I going to align with you and a week or two I just see it again? I want longevity with these people, and it did make me question. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka, while  you were breaking down, were you conscious enough of the game around you to  think, man, this is not good right now? <br/>Well, everything gets  tricky at tribal council. Maybe there's some people that are zipping their lip. Maybe some people are just keeping it 100, which is keeping it real. So I really don't know. There's a lot of smart people on this team so they know when to shut up and  when to talk. <br/>Jeff: Well,  somebody's quest to outlast all the rest is about to come to an end. It is time to vote. Alina, you're up. <br/>This is a grown folks  game and as you say, you're keeping it 100. I'm going to keep it 100. Peace out. <br/>It's time to dethrone  the king of Espada. Benry's here, baby. My bad. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally  the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will asked to leave the tribal council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, NaOnka. Tyrone. Two votes Tyrone, one vote NaOnka. Naonka. We're tied, two votes Tyrone, two votes NaOnka. Tyrone. Tyrone. Four votes Tyrone, two votes NaOnka. Fifth person voted out of Survivor: Nicaragua, Tyrone. That's five, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. Tyrone, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Jeff: Well, there was  a lot of talk tonight about communicating and nurturing. Tyrone felt neither. Your first blind side. Congratulations. Grab your torches, and head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for  scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on Survivor,  Dan wants a bus ticket back to new york. <br/>Jeff: Marty breaks  out his secret weapon. <br/>I am a grand master  in chess. <br/>It does make sense,  man. <br/>Jeff: And look out,  here comes another twist. Tribal immunity is not what you're playing for today. <br/>My plan for this  tribe by being the leader was initially to stay as strong as we could. We operated on a democratic basis, basically, where everybody had some input  and what happened was when La Flor came over, things turned away from the  tribe aspect and that could have been their strategy from the jump. So I'm not real surprised because it's a game that anything can happen and  guess what? Anything happened.
