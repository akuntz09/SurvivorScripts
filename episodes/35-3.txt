<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor": The Hero tribe, Alan  was aiming to take out a power couple. <br/>Whatever JP is actually trying to do, I’m blowing it up. <br/>Jeff: At the Healer tribe, Joe and Cole went on the hunt  for an idol. <br/>Got it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>The fact that Cole knows that I have the idol could  absolutely backfire. <br/>Jeff: At the Hustler tribe, Simone and Patrick were the  clear targets. <br/>Simone's not that great at challenges, but Patrick, even  though he's strong, I don't trust him. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Patrick made a questionable  remark. <br/>I feel like I can trust  most of the people here. <br/>Jeff: But in the end, Simone was sent home. Simone, the tribe has spoken. 16 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? It's big on me. <br/>Here, let me try it on with that. <br/>I look like willy wonka. Simone's clothing was up for grabs. It was kind of like a yard sale. She left a lot of of clothing here, including a nice pair of boots,  a nice pair of pants, a blazer. It's like your "Miami vice" look. Look at that. A perfect fit. You're like my kid getting ready for prom. <br/>How about the boots? <br/>Zip them up. <br/>Zip me up. The practicality of the knee-high boots is, it goes on I mean,  you could avoid crack when does you're idol searching. Finally, Simone is showing her worth in some capacity. <br/>I think we should wait  until the girls get back wash the I don't want to make Lauren mad. <br/>Do you have a preference between the two? <br/>Ali. <br/>To go? <br/>To stay. <br/>You? <br/>I like Ali. Ali is the most relatable female that is on our tribe. She's in the same age range as us, so that's a knock on Lauren. I don't think anybody has anything going on with Lauren, so  that's why she's probably the next one to go. Âª âª  Were you nervous last night? <br/>Of course, you're always nervous. How about me and you, like? Because it's getting down to-- I mean, if we have another-- if  we go to another tribal council, then what? <br/>Yeah. <br/>What--  I think that if we just,  you know, kind of keep the way we are, whatever happens in the next few days. <br/>Even though I didn't get any votes at tribal council, I still  feel like I’m on the outs, because I’m having a hard time trying to make sure  that I’m included. Come join us. <br/>Oh, yeah? <br/>It's nice! <br/>Am I invited? <br/>Being a single mother, I am the only one on my tribe that,  you know, has a kid. And my tribe members, they're like holly buddies. And I’m like the damn teacher. Poor pat. Pat, I mean,... Mmm. How fast is your heart beating? <br/>I didn't like what he  said. That made me nervous. <br/>Yeah. Patrick at tribal he said, "I trust almost everyone  here." well, I don't know if that was really directed towards Simone or  was that directed towards all of us? But now it's given me the opportunity to put the target on Patrick. When you say that in front of all us. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It does kind of put people un-at ease with you, because is  it all of them or most of them? <br/>I have no idea what's  going on with Patrick. At tribal council, he's just blurting out words. <br/>Don't know. We are more calmer than he is. <br/>But if Patrick goes, we're not going to be as strong in  challenges. <br/>It looks like a photo shoot. <br/>He brings a lot in competitions and he works extremely  hard, and I think that's easier to tolerate than someone who doesn't really  bring much at all. <br/>Hey, look at the octopus. <br/>That's a rock! <br/>Look at him now. Are you all stupid? <br/>Patrick doesn't understand that the social game is so huge  for "Survivor," but at this point, I kind of need him, so I kind of  need him not to say things that rub people the wrong way. <br/>You all are all pissing me off now. Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. [ theme song playing] tribe, at this point, you could say that Chrissy  and I are driving the train. But moving forward, Chrissy and I need to figure out who's going  to be the next target. Ashley is a good, hard worker and she's fun so the better  choices are JP and Alan. Alan and I were Aligned on day one, but Alan is a hot head and  loose cannon, and JP is walking around here like he don't know what's going  on. But JP would be good to have around cam because he does fish and  everything. Right now, Chrissy and I haven't made any decisions. <br/>Ah, I've been having trouble with the coconuts. Everybody else has figured out how to get the coconuts open, and  I am struggling with them and I don't know why. God dang it! <br/>It is a workout. <br/>It frustrates me that it takes me 30 minutes to get a  coconut open. [ laughing ]  Take a break. <br/>This is not my element at all. At the end of the day, I played in the n.F.L., and I can't even  get a coconut open. <br/>Get it. <br/>Almost. I tried to laugh about it so people don't think, "Oh, this  guy can't even get a coconut open." but it's tough out here. <br/>JP is becoming, like, dreamier and dreamier as the day  goes on. Every time he walks out of the ocean with a different animal on  his spear, something happens inside me. <br/>Whooo! <br/>That's a good size, JP. <br/>Yeah. <br/>He's becoming the provider, and he's, you know, making  himself more useful lately. And less and less like Alan as the days go by. <br/>That's a good piece of fish. <br/>Yes, it is. <br/>Fut on a stick, cook it. What's up? <br/>That is beautiful! <br/>Not bad for a little guy, huh? <br/>JP and I, we can't talk to each other, because on day two,  Alan decided to go absolutely nuts, calling out JP and I as some kind of  power couple. <br/>Are we going to boil? Fry him? <br/>That's gorgeous. <br/>So now if Alan sees anything between me and JP, he's going  to point it out and he's going to blow it up. So I’m ready for him to go, because I don't know when he is  going to go off again. I don't know if that was part of some master plan he had, but  either way, I don't like it, and I could definitely do without him here  anywhere. JP has been doing more fishing lately. Alan has been cutting more coconuts lately. It feels like they both are trying to be valuable, which is  good. We all really are, I guess. <br/>Right. <br/>But you have to think about your own personal game. It's, like, Alan, he makes his moves out loud. Alan just doesn't seem look a safe bet. <br/>Right, but neither does JP. JP is just a puppy waited to be led somewhere. <br/>But he can be our puppy. <br/>Yeah, but--  We could train him. <br/>But anyone else with a piece of meat dangling in front of  his face. <br/>Right. <br/>He's going to go towards them. <br/>Yeah, but I feel like Alan would do the same "My  tribe thinks I’m crazy."  Oh, yeah. Ashley is tossed to a power couple. What's that is the truth or the whole Alan thing but I can't  fully trust Ashley at this point because she keeps pug for JP to stay in the  game, which makes me think JP and Ashley are still working together. Normally, as a power couple on "Survivor" tdon't work  out good. <br/>Sure. <br/>Are we bringing this bag? <br/>We can bring both bags in case we catch this big fish. I'm feeling good. We've won every challenge. We are a dominant tribe. Life at camp is great. Everyone is still on the same page, with Mike being the number  one vote-out. I got everyone believing Mike has the idol. So I’m cool and conflicted right now. I mean, things couldn't really go better at this point. The only thing is Cole knows I have the idol so that's a concern  of mine. I don't think Cole has told anybody but I’m definitely concerned  about his relationship with Jessica. They have been spending a lot of time together, fishing and  things like that. Cole is like a love bird, and that love bird disease is  dangerous. It's worse than the flu. Âª âª  &gt; the fishing experience is 100% bonding for Cole and I because  it's really the only time we get to be alone, together. And we're really forming a connection. <br/>Got one. <br/>They're biting! I shouldn't have stayed down there, that long. You could have had, like, five. But then life outside of "Survivor" I move like a slug  when it comes to romance. Like, I don't even know if I know what romance means. To be honest, I come from a super-religious background, and I am  a virgin. Oh, my God, I really-- it's awesome. I could stay down there for a really long time. So my face feels red thinking about him thinking about me. Being a couple on "Survivor" is hard. And it's dangerous. So we'll just have to wait and see. We have a long time left together, I hope. <br/>Are you enjoying yourself? <br/>Yeah, I’m having a blast. I like to be out here. Like, away from the game. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>I feel like I can let my  head breathe. <br/>I'll shut up about the game then. <br/>No, no, I want to talk about the game. <br/>I can guarantee you that  you're safe. <br/>Yeah. I better be. You can't get to the end without me. <br/>I don't know about that! But I 100% know that Mike doesn't have the idol. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Because there's some other information. <br/>What other information? <br/>I feel like I do have a  shot with Jessica after our outing today. She just showed me more of herself, and I kept liking it. There wasn't anything I could find wrong with her, honestly. So I was defining her as my dream girl, I guess. So I decided I wanted to share with her some information. So Joe has the idol. We found it together. Right? Right? <br/>I’m so-- can I kiss you  on the cheek? Having the knowledge that Joe has the idol brings me so much  happiness. <br/>I’m going to go rinse  off. <br/>Yup, yup. Secrets are really powerful in this game. It's "Survivor," and so it's to my benefit that I know  Joe's secret. That's power. So unrelated, I mean, I gave him a kiss on the cheek. It just happened. My kisses are very private. Like, my lips don't go near other people's cheeks very often so,  this is big! <br/>Yup. You don't really search for the idol in front of everybody  because it's not good relationship building, and it makes people parinoid. <br/>I do kind of have idol  fever. I want the idol. Now, I mean, I’m not really hiding looking for an idol and, you  know, maybe that will turn around and bite me, but being a Hustler, we're  always moving along-- pun intended. I have a moving company in alabama and the moving industry is it  not stop-- wheels always on the ground, something always in motion. That's why the work harder than the rest of my tribe members,  looking for an idol. <br/>Me and Patrick have a pretty good relationship, but he  doesn't really have a social game, and I want to look out for him. So I think that for my game, I need to help Patrick mesh better with  the group. You have to play smarter, pat, you know, because you going idol  crazy, is going to make people think like, "Why is he so worried?"  you know? <br/>All right. <br/>I’m just telling you  because, like, I don't want something to happen. <br/>She's looking out for my best interest, and I’m looking  out for hers as well. <br/>You know, I don't want your name to be next or my name to  be next. <br/>But Ali telling me to cool it is difficult because it  takes away from my personality. I may not be abe to create relationships if I’m not being me. <br/>Don't dwell on it. It's over. Can't change the past. Look forward the future pup learn, though, learn from it. <br/>I will, always learn. <br/>Thanks for cooking, guys. <br/>My pleasure! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Yeah, that's pretty good. <br/>Not if it's raw. That one's completely raw. See the color. <br/>I just don't think we can  be picky. <br/>I mean... It's not being  picky. This is [bleep] completely raw. <br/>I'll eat it. I don't care. <br/>You'll eat the raw ones. <br/>Joe had some issue with the way we cooked the pa-ta-tas,  not wait he wanted them cooked at exphoam if it's not to his liking he chucks  it in the woods instead of offering it to somebody else to eat so that can be  a bit off-putting, when food is scarce. <br/>I can't eat raw food. I don't know how you all do it. <br/>Joe, you're welcome to cook next time. <br/>Joe complains a lot sometimes around camp. So he's already rubbed some people the wrong way. And then on top of that, Joe has the idol. And the more I thought about Joe having the idol, the more I realize  that Joe has all the power, and I don't like that at all. Here's one idea. So Joe does have the idol. And if we were to lose tonight, like, he'd be super confident  that Mike would go home. <br/>A blindside? I thought that last night. <br/>Send him home with the idol in his pocket. <br/>I know, I know. <br/>The idol is unpredictable, especially in an unpredictable  person's hands and it has a lot of power. And I don't want that power being thrown around without my say  in it. I want to tell you something real quick. Joe has the idol. &gt;yeah. <br/>Okay. <br/>Cole just word vomits that Joe has idol. And I was like, what are you doing? Like, it's too soon. I'm like, why are you sharing that information. <br/>We found it together. And so, we could potentially, if we want to get rid of that  threat, if we lose tonight, we could split votes between Joe and Mike. <br/>I think that he needed to  wait to see what happens after the challenge and talk to me again. And we decide is it what we want to do. <br/>Cool. <br/>If we get rid of Mike this time. <br/>Yes. <br/>And then Joe's still left with the idol, we can't-- he's  going to be a lot more suspicious that he might be on the chopping block. <br/>Joe is an amazing blindside candidate because he is locked  in on Mike. So I am full buy-in into the Joe blindside enjoy your idol a  sufnear plan. <br/>We're thinking Joe over Mike tonight potentially. He's not a strong swimmer. He will not be super good at puzzles. <br/>And he complains a lot. <br/>Right now would be the best time to take him out because Mike  knows he's on the bottom. He's already told me that. He'll go wherever I want him to go. <br/>I like the thought  process, Cole. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>I’m ticked off at Cole  for just running his mouth. He lost a lot of power with me by telling Roark and Desi, and  the last thing we want is for Joe to find out that we know because he could  play his idol, and then any of our heads would be on the chopping block,  probably Cole's first. So right now, him wanting to blindside Joe I am not sure  is  Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Jeff: Heroes and Healers getting your first look at the  new Hustler tribe. Simone voted out at the last tribal council. All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: First things first, take back the idols. Thank you, thank you. Once gae, immunity is back up for grabs. In today's challenge, you're going to race through a series of  obstacles. You'll then use sandbags to knock blocks off a ledge. You must then stack those blocks one on top of the other. First two tribes to finish win immunity, safe from the vote. In addition, we're playing for reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yes, sir! <br/>Jeff: First tribe to finish:  Oh! <br/>Jeff: Four chickens! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: One rooster, three hens. Second tribe to finish:  Beautiful! <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: A dozen eggs courtesy of the first-place chickens. Last tribe to finish, nothing but a date with me at tribal  council where somebody will be the third person voted out of this game. Healers, you have one extra person. You have to sit somebody out. Who is it going to be? <br/>Mike. <br/>Jeff: Mike going to sit out for the Healers. Mike, take a spot on the everyone. Everybody else give you a chance to strategize and get it on. All right, here we go. For immunity and reward, Survivors ready? Go! Under and over, under and over! That's it! Everybody doing great out of the gate! Gotta get everybody to the mat before you can start working on  this next phase. Go, Heroes! Go, Healers! Go, Hustlers! Now you have to get everybody over. Ashley up first, Cole up first help Healers pushing Lauren up  first. There goes desdezy for the Healers and Patrick for the Hustlers. They're now going to pull up JP. And that leaves Alan as the last for the Heroes. That's a leap right there. The Heros are up and over quickly! <br/>Let's go, let's go! <br/>Jeff: It is work, the last Healer. And here goes the last Hustler! Go! It is Ben tossing sandbags for the Heros. It's Cole for the Healers. <br/>Chuck them, pat! <br/>Jeff: And Patrick for the Hustlers. We've got a challenge going here! Day eight on "Survivor."  Right in the middle. <br/>Jeff: Ben with a nice hit. <br/>Way to end it, good job. <br/>Jeff: JP coming in for ben. Patrick with a nice hit! <br/>Nice. <br/>Jeff: Cole with another big hit! <br/>You're doing awesome! <br/>Jeff: JP with another nice hit. Another big hit by Cole. <br/>There you go. <br/>Jeff: Heroes down to four blocks left. <br/>Good job, pat. <br/>Hustlers down to seven. <br/>Keep it going, baby! <br/>Jeff: JP with a nice hit. He's down to two! <br/>You want to switch out? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Joe now throwing for the Healers. <br/>You want to switch? Don't get tired. Pat, can I attack a turn? <br/>Sure. There you go. <br/>Jeff: Patrick still going for the Hustlers. JP down to one block left! There's one for Joe for the Healers. Patrick with another hit for the Hustlers. Heroes have one block left. Just misses! Joe with another hit for the Healers. They're down to two! The Hustlers down to two! <br/>One more! <br/>Jeff: Healers down to one now. There it is! Go, Healers! Start getting all your blocks over before you stack. JP hits the last block for the Heroes. Gather your blocks! <br/>Pat, do you want to switch? <br/>Jeff: It is now the Hustlers, last group to get through  this. Patrick has one left now. <br/>Here we go. <br/>Big ones first, big ones first. <br/>Pat, do you need to switch? <br/>Jeff: Patrick still firing for the Hustlers. <br/>He's get sewing tired. <br/>Jeff: While the Healers and Heroes start stacking. You can put them in any order you want. It just has to be one on top of the other. <br/>Are you ready to swap? <br/>We can swap if you want, pat. <br/>Pat park. <br/>Jeff: Patrick still the only person to throw for the Hustlers. <br/>If you want to switch, you can switch. <br/>Jeff: There it is! Go, Hustlers! Got to gather all your blocks before you start stacking. <br/>I can't get it up. <br/>Here, two at a time. <br/>I need to be higher. <br/>Jeff: This is reminiscent of the first challenge when you  had to stand on each others' shoulders. <br/>Hold my leg! <br/>Healers doing a nice job. Healers working very quickly. <br/>Hold my legs! <br/>Jeff: Hustlers still racing to catch up. Chrissy is up on the shoulders of the Heroes. Jessica up on the shoulders of the Healers. <br/>This is the last one! We're winning. <br/>Jeff: Healers have not lost a challenge yet. They think they have it! Something is not right, no. <br/>What's not right? <br/>Are we missing a block? <br/>Jeff: This opens the door for the Hustlers and the Heroes. <br/>What's not--  Block, block, block. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Jeff: The Healers did not have all their blocks! Huge mistake by the Healers. <br/>Get down! <br/>Joe, give it to me! <br/>Jeff: Heroes got it! Get back to your mat. 3, 2, 1, Heroes win immunity and reward! Jessica now back up for the Healers. Hustlers struggling to get Ryan up. <br/>Let me down! Just drop me! <br/>It's okay. It's okay. <br/>Jeff: Healers win immunity and reward, sending the Hustler  tribe to tribal council again. <br/>Good job. <br/>Oh, my God, that was so awesome! <br/>Jeff: Here organization congratulations. Immunity is yours. Nobody going home tonight. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Healers, once again, safe from tribal council. Nobody going home. Hero tribe, thanks to the mistake by the Healers, nice reward  for you. Come grab your chickens. Head back to camp. Enjoy the night off. Healers, fortunately, you still have the eggs. Come grab them. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. No tribal council tonight. Patrick, what's the feeling? We're only eight days in, and, yet, you're going back to tribal,  gog lose another tribe member. You're already down to five. Is it going to be a bit of a madhouse? <br/>Yes, Jeff. We all like each other and we all get along well, and it's quite  depressing knowing that we're going back. <br/>But we're going, and we gotta do it. <br/>Jeff: All right, guys, grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal, where somebody will be the third  person voted out of this game. <br/>We just lost the challenge, but Patrick didn't want to  stop. It was like a one-man show. I've been playing center field for 25 years. I can hit a catcher in the forehead. And I think everybody's pretty much over Patrick in the way this  he cost us today, and I want to make sure that Patrick is going home. Hitting all the targets like I should have been, and I should  have let somebody, possibly, sub in for me. Sorry. <br/>You jaent justify it, you know what I mean? <br/>I should have been  better. Lauren's not happy with me. But by looking at her, I don't think that her coming in for me  would have really changed much. I'm sorry, guys. <br/>Don't be sorry. <br/>Yeah. We're all good. <br/>I know you tried your  hardest, man. That's all that matters. <br/>That's all that matters. <br/>I’m gonna rinse off. <br/>Well, guys, what's--  We're good. She wants you out. We're getting her out. That's all there is to it. <br/>I mean, she has said him? <br/>I think she assumes. <br/>That's great. <br/>Why is it great? <br/>I’m being very sarcastic. <br/>Don't even worry. <br/>So tonight, I've got the guys on my side. I've got Ali on my side, and I’m comfortable knowing Lauren's  going home. But I don't want her going around worrying, so I’m trying to,  you know, make sure I continue to have her part of my conversation and, you  know, making her enjoy herself here. You good? <br/>I’m as good as I can get,  I guess. How about you? <br/>I feel terrible. <br/>Feel terrible? <br/>Yeah. Freaking couldn't knock any of those freaking blocks down. <br/>Well, we kept saying we'd switch out with you. We kept saying, we could tell you were tired, and I played  outfield for 25 years. Me and Ali kept saying that. But you acted like we weren't even there. It was like a one-man team there for a little while. To lose today it, just in general, I’m bummed out about it, but Patrick  wouldn't quit. And it really did cost us. I would much rather lose as a team than one person lose for  everybody. I'm assuming you all are going to try to vote me out tonight. <br/>I don't know if that's  right. <br/>If it's not me, who else is is it if you have somebody  else in mind? Because I can look at you and tell you have me in mind. <br/>Yeah, but--  Yeah but what? <br/>I don't want to go home. <br/>Redheads don't do very well at lying. So you costing us the win cost vote meeg out today. That makes no sense whatsoever. All he could do is grin, so I know for a fact that Patrick will  write my name down. You know, to be a good fisherman do I sit here in the same spot  every day and wait for the fish to come by? No. I try numerous different things and I never threw my handsut  without trying my hardest. <br/>What upset me at the end is the way he was grinning at me,  like it was funny. <br/>If he had-- he would have realized, it would have been  more on the team than him. <br/>Exactly. <br/>It wouldn't have been a Patrick loss, it would have been,  "At least we all tried." Patrick being the competitive person that  he is, he was supposed to be one strong in challenges. But again, when it came down to it, we didn't win. And it's kind of like a repetition for us. So I need to figure out if Patrick being around is really an  advantage anymore. <br/>I mean, don't take this  offensively, but you're the oddball. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>And I’m the old woman. <br/>Now that Simone is gone--  Exactly. <br/>And I trust Ali and I trust Devon but I don't  trust--  Pat, yeah. <br/>He's a wild card. <br/>Lauren just came up to me and she's just like, "It's  going to be Patrick."  Okay. <br/>She's like, "You're the oddball, and, like, I’m the  old lady, so... I was like uh...  What matters is we have--  Fu for sure. <br/>Everybody coming to us. <br/>Devon and I are in position where we can sort of dictate  the vote. The options now are vote off Lauren or vote off pat. <br/>What do you joong this is unequivocally a big decision for  me. And I don't know exactly what to do yet. <br/>Pat's just--  I want to save pat. We get rid of Lauren tonight. And we can do the boys to the merge. What do you want to do? Pat and Lauren hate each other. <br/>Yeah, but I'd rather-- I think I'd rather go to the merge  with Lauren than with pat. <br/>We don't know if we'll get to the merge. I'm going back and forth. <br/>Pat stepped up at the challenge, but if you're going to  step up, you better be able to handle what you step up for. It was just pat choking. And I do think we lost because of that. Lauren, on the other hand, she's very steady. I trust her. But, she doesn't really fit in with the other tribe members, and  if we keep Lauren around, we're more likely to lose the next immunity  challenge, and we've already lost two in a row. <br/>I could be a hot head,  but at the same time, I know when to turn it into I know when it to turn it  off. I feel like I've done everything I can do. Obviously, I’m a Hustler for a reason. So if it is me going home tonight, I will promise you, I’m not  going to go home without a fight. Not going to go home without a fight. <br/>Jeff: All right, so Lauren, eight days in. You've lost two out of three immunity challenges. At what point do you guys stop talking about how well you get  along and start owning the fact that it just isn't working right now with  this group? <br/>Today. I mean, that challenge should have been a win for us. But one of us kind of took it to their own level and tried to  complete it by themselves. <br/>Jeff: Patrick, she can only be talking about you and the  sandbags, right? <br/>Yes, sir, I am. <br/>Definitely talking about me, Jeff. I can see where she's concerned with me not winning that, and  there is a point where it could be my fault. I should not have taken the entire time for myself. <br/>I agree. I mean I was going to finish the sentence, but he finished it  for me. He shouldn't have took the whole time himself. I mean, I played outfield, center field for probably 25 years. You have to realize that it's not a one-man show sometimes. We have to lose together and we need to win together. And today, we didn't lose together. <br/>It's an adrenaline rush. <br/>I understand that, son,  but you know when you went up there, there was five of us. And then there wasn't mysteriously just one person left. We didn't disappear. <br/>I totally understand. <br/>Jeff: Ali what was your take on the challenge? <br/>Patrick did call an executive decision and say, "I'm  staying in." yon if that should have to do with anything about us being  here. Who knows if we had switched we could have tooken even longer? For me I don't like to dwell on things from the past and we need  to look further from here. <br/>Jeff: Patrick, does that give you a little sense of  comfort that you're not going to be judged on one element for one challenge? <br/>For sure. Jeff, I tried my best, and it definitely gives me a sense of comfort  in knowing I’m not going to be held totally accountable. I wanted those chickens. They looked so good. <br/>Jeff: Lauren, you had your hand raised. <br/>Like I said, we still have to play as a team, and today  just showed that Patrick is not exactly a team player. I mean, he's a good idol hunter. That's all he does. Ey admitted, "I'm constantly looking. I'm constantly looking." it keeps you on edge knowing that  someone is trying to play strategy and worried mus enough they need to cover  their back. I don't think I've looked for the idol yet, but if he's hunting,  maybe we should all go hunting. <br/>Jeff: Patrick, you had a big reaction to Lauren saying she  hasn't looked yet. <br/>I’m worried that Lauren  has an idol, and her saying she hasn't looked was a big relief. <br/>I have two of them. <br/>I had a quick  conversation with Lauren and said, "Who are and and I didn't give her an  answer. <br/>Let's say what you really said. You approached me with a smile which is very obvious and I said,  "Obviously, you're voting for me tonight." and he sat there and  grinned and I said you're trying to comfort me when I never believed a  redhead a day in my life. Jeff, I will say, tonight, one of us is going to be blindsided. I can say that. <br/>You're right, somebody will be blindsided for sure. <br/>Jeff: Ryan, it's kind of like you're in a  relationship--  I've never been in a relationship. <br/>Jeff: Okay. <br/>You know somebody? [ laughter ]. <br/>Jeff: Well, I was just going to say, it's kind of like if  you're in a relationship and guto therapy. The first thing the therapist will say is let's just talk. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Get it out, and things will get better. Can you feel that, the tribe is airing to get movement going? <br/>I do feel that way  because I think every member of the group is thinking yeah, this is a happy  group and I’m contributing to that happy group. But it's not a happy group, and we're not a successful group at  that. So somebody is influencing the group in a negative way. <br/>Jeff: Devon, is it possible that part of the problem of  this group is just chemistry? <br/>Yeah. My vote tonight is, you know, headed in that direction, what is  going to get that chemistry going again, so that we can win  I think my vote is going  to be for the same reason. <br/>Jeff: Chemistry. <br/>Chemistry, to keep us rolling. It ain't necessarily what was done. It's how to make it better. <br/>But, also, for whenever the merge comes, we need to be  best suited going forward to socially discern which group can we fit into. Because strategically, what the heck are we going to present  stroojically to them? Are we going to show them how to do challenges after that? That's just not going to happen. <br/>Jeff: Patrick, do you feel that pressure, too, that if  there's a merge coming, man, what are we going to do? <br/>For sure. We're already fewer numbers than the other tribes so how can we  work together to gain numbers? Who can talk the best? Who can make friends the easiest? And I think that's something I can offer. I can make people feel loved and comforted and that's part of  making friends and getting an alliance. <br/>Jeff: Ali, that's a really honest statement from Patrick. <br/>I guess that's his  opinion. He may think he gets along with people but why can't you get  along with Lauren and we've been together for eight days. How easy is it going to be for him with people who have clicked  eight, 10, 15 days and we have to try to squeeze ourselves in there. <br/>Jeff: Patrick, you have a smile on your face. Is that because something is happening for this tribe, even  though we're at the worst place you can be, tribal council? <br/>You know, Jeff, I always welcome criticism because, you  know, I’m not a perfect person. I know I have-- I have difficulties in-- in growing, like  everyone else. Hearing Ali tell me that I’m not necessarily a good social  player. And hearing Lauren tell me that I’m not listening to the team  while we're going through challenges, you know, it is a wake-up call to me. <br/>Jeff: So, Patrick, you just took two lethal criticisms  from two different people and you're saying, "I welcome it. I'm learning."  Right. And, you know, I want to grow from all this. <br/>Jeff: Ryan, is it too big of a stretch to say that moments  like that between Ali and lawren and Patrick can actually flip a tribe? <br/>You know, tribal council is-- is very-- it has so much  momentum, right? And you can gain so much because you just come together and say,  "This is the group. This is the moment that we're going to shine up this crappy  little tricycle and try to sell it to these other tribes who now, we're not  going to be used as pawns. That's not what we're saying at all. We also understand we're not comincoming in as the c.E.O.S. We may be month the floors at first. <br/>Which is why we're Hustlers. <br/>Exactly. I'm not giving up. Nobody here is giving up. And we are the only tribe that is going to have real unity and  that is something unique about us and they don't have that. <br/>Jeff: All right, it is time to vote. Lauren, you're up. You're aggravating! <br/>I’m sorry, Lauren. You had to go. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Patrick. Lauren. One vote Patrick, one vote Lauren. Patrick. That's two votes Patrick, one vote Lauren. Third person voted out of "Survivor," Patrick. That's three. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Oh! You guy guys are awful. <br/>Jeff: Patrick, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Jeff: Patrick, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Jeff: Well, tribal is the end for somebody but tonight, it  also appears to be a rebirth for the rest of the tribe. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org  Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor": Just when you  think you're on top--  Things were well oiled and greased. We are moving. <br/>Jeff: The game flips upside down. Everybody drop your buffs. <br/>Whoa! <br/>Jeff: We are switching tribes. <br/>My palms are sweating. My heart was racing. <br/>Oh! <br/>Everything gets erased and it's a brand-new game. <br/>Wild. <br/>This is the worst thing I've ever felt. I had no idea it was coming. I it total trust with Ryan, Devon, and Ali. I hope you guys don't have a very successful game because you're  liars and it really hurts me that you would not keep your word. It's too early in the game for me to leave and this has been devastating.
