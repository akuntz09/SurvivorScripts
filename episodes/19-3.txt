<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously, on Survivor... Here in Samoa, there are two tribes  going in two different directions. For the purple tribe, Galu, it's sunshine and rainbows. <br/>Coco rico In my belly...  Probst: They've won both immunity challenges, and everyone is happy. [laughter] Everyone except Shambo. <br/>The way that the rest of the tribe does things is way different than the way  that I do things, and it's very frustrating. <br/>Probst: Losing has frustrated everyone on Foa Foa... everyone except Russell. <br/>I didn't come here to work. I came here to play. <br/>Probst: Russell is the first person in Survivorhistory to find a hidden  immunity idol without any clues. <br/>Boo-yah. <br/>Probst: He's figured out how to manipulate the others into doing his bidding. <br/>They can be my little puppets. They'll run when I tell 'em to run, they'll walk when I tell 'em to walk. And when I'm finished with them, I'll just throw 'em in the trash. <br/>Probst: Meanwhile, Ben put people on edge without even trying. [Ben babbling gibberish] He got kicked out of a challenge...  Probst: Stop! First time in the history of Survivor. Take a spot here-- you're done. Take a spot here-- you're done. ...kept everyone up all night... ...kept everyone up all night... ...and  lashed out at a visitor from the other tribe. <br/>If I was a girl, I would slap you, is what I would do. Ghetto trash, plain and simple. <br/>Probst: Ben's actions put a target on his back. <br/>We got a loss because he got thrown out of the challenge yesterday. Ben would be the right choice to kick out-- he's crazy. <br/>Probst: But Russell wanted Betsy out, because Betsy didn't trust him. <br/>Why didn't you trust me from the beginning? You're gonna look back on this and regret it. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Russell got his way. Ben was spared, and Betsy was voted out. 17 are left. 17 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>I did a lot of thinking last night. What have you been thinking? <br/>I've been thinking Ben's got to be the next to go. <br/>Tell me why, is that for personal reasons? <br/>The guy's mean. <br/>I agree with you. <br/>I want him out. <br/>You see how he laid into her? I mean, it wasn't just an argument. It got really personal and, I think, inappropriate. <br/>"Ghetto trash." That's not necessary. <br/>Totally. Like, that's  Totally. Like, that's terrible. terrible. At the last Tribal Council, Ben was this close from saying something to  Yasmin that would've made me fly over a stool and say... and not even say  but, you know, put him down. We voted off Betsy, but at this point, Ben is a mental plague on point, Ben  is a mental plague on our tribe. our tribe. <br/>Ashley. How you feel? <br/>I feel good. <br/>How you feel about last night? <br/>It's always brutal, but it was the... I mean, it was the majority, it was the  plan, so...  Do you have any in mind who you would want to...? you would want to...? <br/>Gosh. <br/>Gosh. <br/>Nobody here's playing the game. Nobody is playing the game but me, on my tribe. Not one person-- it's crazy. <br/>I think we should definitely see how today goes before we start discussing...   Well, today's just a reward, I hope. <br/>Yeah, I don't know what today is. <br/>I don't know, this might be the worst group in history, and I might be the  best. I'm gonna have them all under control like zombies walking control like  zombies walking around. Mmm... around. Mmm... [birds chirping] [birds chirping]  Did you put a ton in or just enough to cover the top a little bit? <br/>If that doesn't get it started, I don't know what the hell will. <br/>Just... let me just show you one time. Hold it really, really tight...  Mm-hmm. <br/>...and try to push that spark into there. You want to try? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Just doing that, though, you're gonna destroy the flint. <br/>Yeah? <br/>Yeah. We're almost out of flint, 'cause these people don't know what they're doing. I'm the only one that knows how to start the fire. I think a lot of these people out here, they're not used to being out in the  woods. Kind of pansies and... Mick's not an outdoorsy guy like myself. I wasn't surprised he didn't know how to do it. I tried to show him and give him a few tips. Didn't really help. <br/>It's usually a little bit easier than this, yeah? <br/>Not with a flint like that. <br/>Really? <br/>Want me to try for a sec? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Without my help, these people  Without my help, these people will die. will die. I save the day once again. <br/>Oh, you got it going? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Nice. <br/>Nice. <br/>I started the fire this morning. Mick was trying to. He was having a lot of trouble with it. It's a lot of technique, it's a lot of strength. Like, not to be chauvinistic, not to put you girls down-- you won't be able  to start the fire with the flint. The way it's worn down, it's, like, flat? <br/>Yeah. <br/>If you just try, like, it's gonna be, like, you're just gonna waste it. So I wouldn't even... I wouldn't even attempt to. I'm not just saying that. You're hands aren't big enough-- you can't grip the machete and get down and  do it. <br/>Ben is trying to tell everybody they can't survive without Ben. Which, hey, I applaud it. You're trying to save yourself. But that's not how you do it. <br/>Ben, did you sleep last night? <br/>First time in seven days. Did you poop yet? <br/>No. <br/>I pooped this morning, and it was, like, the biggest poop, I think, in my  life. <br/>Ew. <br/>You see, as long as Ben keeps his crazy rantics going on, his ass is gonna be  on the line. <br/>You want to bite me? You want something to bite on? I got something for you, buddy. <br/>I got to keep Ben here a little bit longer, 'cause he's good for the  challenges, and he's the strongest guy around the camp. So I'm gonna have to debate which baby I'm gonna have to send home next. <br/>Lizard, anybody? <br/>Lizard, anybody? <br/>Exhale out slowly through the nose. <br/>You got it. <br/>Again. Nice strident back, all the way up. Breath in through the nose. Hold it in. Right now we're winning. We're feeling good. There's great morale. We're working hard. We're all pitching in at camp. We're all doing stuff. Exhale out. So we don't have to always be in game mode, and that's a huge, huge advantage  that we have over Foa Foa. Foa Foa. And relax. And relax. <br/>Are you frickin' kidding me? We got four people doing yoga this morning? I'm kind of alienated from my tribe, 'cause I'm not in the 90210 clique. <br/>We're gonna do this slow two more times, then we're gonna put it in rhythm. <br/>I'm not doing the warm and fuzzy, I'm doing the Rambo Shambo provider role  out here. <br/>Feet up at an angle. <br/>Do we have water? No. Do we have food? No. Do we have firewood? No. Do we have firewood? No. Screw yoga, man. Screw yoga, man. <br/>So what I'm figuring is, she's becoming a threat to us. So, uh, one thing I do know for a fact is she was trying to get rid of you. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>"Got to get rid of Ben. Got to get rid of Ben." So just don't tell her nothin'. We're gonna sneak her. We're gonna tell her whoever, and then we're gonna all vote for her. The reason I told Ben about Ashley gunning for him is 'cause right now I  think I need Ben. So every person that tries to get rid of him, I'm gonna get rid of them. I don't want her to start talking, "Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben."  Nobody listens to her anyway. <br/>Yeah. So, you know, just keep it to where we can blindside her. <br/>Cool. <br/>All right, man. I'm telling you, you plant that little seed in their head, in their little  brain, and then it grows, and it's called a "Russell seed." It  takes over their whole mind. So that makes it easy for me to manipulate every single one of manipulate  every single one of them. them. <br/>You know what? Last night you stabbed me in the back. <br/>I did nothing wrong. I was playing the game. <br/>You didn't come to me when you heard something about me, at all. <br/>Because I didn't think I needed to at that exact moment. <br/>You know what? That's the easiest thing, to come and say, "Hey, you know what,  everybody's talking about you." I had to find out from somebody else. <br/>Who'd you find out from? <br/>It wasn't Russell, that's all I'm saying. And I don't trust you, so I'm And I don't trust you, so I'm not gonna say  anything else. not gonna say anything else. That's not surprising. <br/>When people fight, I love that. How can they not even think it was me, you know? These people are just idiots. It is shocking that these people trust me so much. I mean, they really do. I mean, they really do. Everybody here trusts me. Everybody here trusts me. <br/>No, that's not true. <br/>I know. <br/>I can promise you that's not true. <br/>No, I know. You gonna say something to him? I did not say that. I didn't. <br/>You know what I told him, I was, like, you know what, I'm was, like, you know  what, I'm not gonna fight with you. not gonna fight with you. <br/>I've never been so confused in my entire life. Yesterday Ben's name got thrown around by everyone, and apparently, someone  said that I was the one that brought it up, so I do not feel safe. so I do not feel safe. I want to know who told him. I want to know who told him. <br/>Brett's back, Monica's back. <br/>Tree mail! <br/>I love presents. <br/>Is everyone here? <br/>Oh, there's a... like, a bag. <br/>I know. <br/>I like the feel, though. <br/>You see over here? I just want to go over here. <br/>Like the feel. That's a pillowcase right there. <br/>Oh! [indistinct chatter]  You ready? <br/>All right, go ahead. <br/>Yeah, go ahead. <br/>"If you can't run or swim or lift or carry, then you'd better be damn  smart. Only one tribe stays home safe and comfy while the loser shall depart."  Wow. <br/>Bathing suits! <br/>Yeah, dude. <br/>Yay! [cheering]  All right, so...  Oh. <br/>Yay! <br/>Yes. <br/>So we got tree mail today. It came with this nice comfy little dry sack of clothing which most of us  guessed would be swimsuits. I'm putting this right on right now! So now, here it is. And it feels awesome and dry and soft and fabulous. Oh, yay! I can't even tell you how amazing this feels. <br/>Shambo, how you feeling? <br/>Ready to rock 'n' roll, man. I got my jogger bra on. [laughs]  I just did it the wrong way. <br/>'Cause you're the blonde. <br/>Of course. [laughter] [laughter] Of course. Of course. Of course. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Galu getting your first look at the new Foa Foa tribe. Betsy voted out at the last Tribal Council. You'll also notice that Mike Borassi is gone from the game. Medical's decision, not his. Nonetheless, he is gone. Foa Foa is now down to seven. Guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yup. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: First things first. I will take back the immunity idol. Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, two members of each tribe will swim out to retrieve a  crate. The section between the four flags is a battle zone where a defender from the  other tribe will be waiting to try to slow you down. It will get physical. Once both swimmers get through the zone, you're free to retrieve your crate. Once you have your crate back to the mat, the next two go. Once you've collected all four crates, you must stack them so that there are  no repeating colors on any side. First tribe to get it right wins a lot. Immunity. If you have immunity, you do not go to Tribal Council. You cannot be voted out of this game. In addition, the winning tribe wins reward. A lot of comfort. <br/>Oh! <br/>Yay! <br/>Oh! <br/>It's a hammock! <br/>Probst: Because this challenge runs six on six, both tribes are sitting  people out. Foa Foa, you're sitting out one man. <br/>Russell. <br/>Probst: All right. Russell's going to sit out for Foa Foa. Galu, you're sitting out four people-- two men, two women. <br/>Shambo, Yasmin for the two girls. Erik and Brett for the two guys. <br/>Probst: All right, sit-outs take your spot. I'll give you a minute to I'll give you a minute to strategize, we'll get  started. strategize, we'll get started. First round, Liz and Natalie for Foa Foa. Monica and Laura for Galu. Defenders-- Kelly for Galu, Ashley for Foa Foa. For immunity and reward. Survivors ready? Go! Go! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Ashley takes down Monica. Laura getting in on it. [overlapping shouting]  Come on, Laura! <br/>Probst: Liz and Natalie getting tied up from Kelly. She's got both of them. Yeah, Kelly! Laura is dragging Ashley. Literally dragging her out of the battle zone. You're both free! Go! Both of you have to be at the crate! <br/>Ashley! <br/>Probst: Liz is now dragging her tribe mate out of the battle zone. You're free. Go! <br/>Go! Go! Go! Go! <br/>Come on, ladies! <br/>Probst: Monica and Laura heading back with that first crate for Galu. Natalie and Liz need to make up some time. Liz and Natalie at that first crate. Monica and Laura are back. John and Dave heading out on the course, Ben defending against John and Dave. [indistinct shouting] Both guys elude Ben! You're clear! [cheering] Natalie and Liz back with that first crate. Mick and Jaison taking on Russell. Russell takes down Mick. Ben is now on Russell. Jaison getting in on it. [grunting] [indistinct chatter &amp; shouting] Mick gets free! Jaison is free. John and Dave heading back with that second crate for Galu and a big, big  lead. <br/>Come on in there. <br/>Nice job, nice job! [indistinct chatter]  Probst: Monica and Laura now back out. Ashley trying to defend again. Ashley takes down Monica hard in the water. [cheering] Ashley has Laura's leg. Mick and Jaison back with the second crate for Foa Foa. Liz and Natalie back out on the course. [indistinct shouting] Kelly unstoppable. Liz once again pulling her tribe mates across. You're free. Monica and Laura heading back with that third crate for Galu. [indistinct shouting] Natalie and Liz at that third crate for Foa Foa. They're heading back. [overlapping chatter] Go! Galu heading out for their fourth and final crate. Russell now deflecting against Ben. <br/>Whoa. <br/>Probst: John taunts Ben, and he's free. They're both free of Ben. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Natalie and Liz now back with that third crate. Jaison and Mick now heading out, looking for their fourth and final crate. Ben has Russell, takes him down, and that's it. Mick and Jaison are free. John and Dave at that fourth crate heading back for Galu. Mick and Jaison have their fourth and final crate. They're heading back. John and Dave turning on the afterburners now, and they're running it in. Start untying the crates. Come on with the knots. Mick and Jaison now running it up. <br/>All right, guys. <br/>Probst: Start untying. <br/>Let's go, Galu! <br/>Probst: Galu already starting to work on their puzzle. They have a big lead after the swim. Foa Foa trying to catch up. Each side of this puzzle must have four different colors. <br/>Rotate this one. <br/>Probst: If you have two of the same color on any side, it is wrong. [overlapping chatter] Foa Foa thinks they have it. Rotate it. Green, red, blue, green. No! <br/>Keep going! <br/>Probst: You've got a repeating color. Keep working. <br/>Bring up the bottom of this one. <br/>Right here. <br/>Green! <br/>This is the one. <br/>Green over here! Red...  Probst: Galu thinks they have it. Rotate it. Green, blue, purple, red. Green, blue, purple, red. Purple, red, green, blue. Last side-- blue, green, purple, red. Galu wins immunity and reward! [cheering]  Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! [whooping]  Probst: Galu, for the third straight time, immunity is yours. [applause] Once again, Galu, safe from Tribal Council. Nobody going home on this tribe. In addition, huge reward. Along with that, a decision for your leader. Russell, come on up here. So here's the deal. This is what you won-- comfort. If you want, as leader, you can trade it for this. <br/>Oh, there's a tarp. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: You have comfort, or you have function. Five seconds to decide. <br/>Comfort. <br/>Probst: All right, right over here. [applause, cheers and whooping]  Probst: Galu, any debate for you about which would have made more sense for  the tribe? <br/>We've been fine in food. We're fine. We need comfort. We want to lay our heads down. That's it. That's the way to go. <br/>And that's why I made the decision, Jeff. I am a function guy, but they are a comfort group right now, so I got to go  with the group. <br/>Probst: Okay. <br/>But there was that split second, I was like, "Towels? What the hell do we need towels for? There's no showers out here." I know the guys are going to be all over  me, but at the end of the day, if I make the women happy, we're going to be  happy. [laughing] [whooping]  Russell took the comfort. Danger Dave here would have said, "Geez, let me think about this for  zero seconds. I'll take the function." But it was the chief's choice. We were not allowed to make the decision. <br/>Probst: All right, Russell, you have one other decision to make now. You're sending one person from your tribe over to Foa Foa. Once again, a chance for somebody to observe, sit in on Tribal Council. Who are you going to send? <br/>Shambo. <br/>Probst: Shambo, you're going over to the other side. How do you feel about that? <br/>I'm good. <br/>Probst: Come over here. This is for you. It says, "Open in private." Go join Foa Foa. Shambo will stay with you through Tribal Council, and then return back to her  own camp. All right, Galu, grab your stuff, get your reward, head stuff, get your  reward, head out. out. <br/>Ashley stabbed me in the back the other day, so Ashley back the other day, so  Ashley is gonna get the snip. is gonna get the snip. <br/>You're Mick? <br/>Yeah, hi. <br/>we call you "Mc-Dreamy."  Good to have you. <br/>Jaison? <br/>Jaison. <br/>What's up, brother? <br/>How you doing, Shambo? <br/>I'm Shannon. <br/>I'm Liz. <br/>You are one tough, beast-like competitor. Come here. <br/>I can't believe...  Oh, my God, girl. <br/>At the end of the challenge, the winning tribe got to pick someone to come  over to our tribe, so Russell chose Shambo. A totally different vibe than Yasmin. I mean, she's just-- we'd like to adopt her. I mean, she's just such great energy. She's just good people. <br/>Ashley. <br/>Hi, smiley girl, how are you? <br/>Good. <br/>So nice to finally talk to you. <br/>I know. <br/>One of my main objectives in this game was to create interpersonal  relationships as soon as possible. So when Russell picked me to go, I was tickled pink to head over and check  out Foa Foa. <br/>Shambo, I'm Ben. <br/>Big Benjamin, what's going on, beefcake? <br/>Nothing much. <br/>Those bright eyes smiling at everybody all the time. There was a lot of chitter-chat. I shared with them, they shared with me. And, it's funny, people here are closer to my own age, they get me, I get  them. I feel like I have more in common with this tribe than people on my tribe. <br/>They're all younger. <br/>They're like 90210. I'm hanging out with 90210and it's absolutely mind-boggling. I don't think it's like life or death to, say, get everybody together in the  morning and go, "Okay, you guys, this is what we need to accomplish, and  as soon as we get it done, the day is yours."  Yeah, we get crab...  90210wanted to do yoga this morning instead of get water. <br/>Yoga? <br/>Really? <br/>We don't have the luxury of doing yoga. We're like up the...  I'm sorry, baby. I'm not in the Survivorgame to play yoga, okay? <br/>Of course she's here for a reason, so she's here to find the immunity idol, I  presume, and to get information to go back to her tribe which she claims  she's not super tight with. But you always have to assume someone's lying, always. <br/>You guys appreciate me for the woman I am. <br/>Yeah! <br/>I love you, Shannon. <br/>I love you, Shannon. <br/>Yoga. <br/>Yoga. <br/>When I got the note from Jeff I thought it was hidden immunity idol clues,  and I was exactly right. "If you think you need protection and would like immunity, look here at  Foa Foa and bark up the right tree. Clue 2: Within sight of the fire and close to the ground, seek the root of  the problem and salvation will be found." Wow. I am very excited. There's a hidden immunity idol at the Foa Foa camp. My tribe is probably going to try to vote me out sooner or later anyway. later anyway. So this totally rocks. So this totally rocks. <br/>Now Shambo has the second note, but I have the immunity idol without any  letters or anything. I just used my brilliant brain to figure out where it was. I'm running this whole show right now. right now. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. That was, like, such a great...  We have blankets! <br/>So, to be honest my natural inclination today was to take that camping stuff. But here's the deal-- I'm the type of man that believes that you're supposed  to take care of your women, all right? I've got a wife and a daughter. They're not here. You guys are, all right? Right now, you guys are part of my women. I got to take care of you, all right? So, guys, I wanted you to know that. So we've got a little bit of work to do. Hopefully we can get some good food...  We'll get the bed fixed. How's that? <br/>That sounds good. <br/>After we arrived back at camp with our comfort items there was a little  monologue given by Russell that I think to him he sort of felt, like, to him  he sort of felt, like, obliged to justify his decision. obliged to justify his decision. <br/>We're having a bed. <br/>For crying out loud, how comfortable are four pillows, three beach towels and  two woven palm frond mats going to make you? You're still going to be uncomfortable. <br/>How are those mats feeling? <br/>Perfect. <br/>Come lay down here with me. <br/>Russell did not take the tarp and I think that was a bad move. I would have sacrificed everything on that comfort item list for the tarp. Because maybe it won't rain for 39 days. Maybe I'm wrong. But the day it does rain over here, every single one of those comfort luxury  items are going to be soaked and all of a sudden not so comfortable. These girls here think that this is like Club Med. It's not Club Med. <br/>Oh, yeah! <br/>You did so good out there. <br/>You did. <br/>You did. <br/>I'm so proud of you. <br/>I'm so proud of you. <br/>Yeah. I mean, it's like this. If it's not, then I'm leaving. So everybody can make a So everybody can make a decision. decision. I'm just saying. Like I am going to put it out there like that. That is my ultimatum. <br/>That's fine. <br/>I'm trying to circulate it that I might just walk away if Ben is here after  Tribal Council. You know, I have no intention of quitting whatsoever, but I'm willing to do  just about anything to get rid of that guy right now. It's the racist comments. I won't stand here and tolerate that. I just won't. <br/>Natalie, if I get kicked out I'm leaving you my sweater and my tennis shoes,  okay? <br/>Jaison is like it's either me or him. <br/>No, it's either me or him? <br/>No, it's either me or him? <br/>No, no, no. <br/>No, no, no. <br/>I don't know what to think anymore. No one understands unless their name gets brought up. Ben has some personal thing against me. And I'm trying as much as possible to not have me eliminated. eliminated. But it's hard. But it's hard. <br/>Ashley's going home. <br/>And who else is on board with that? You? Yeah. I'm saying...  All right. <br/>So Russell and Liz are adamant about voting Ashley out, but that worries me  because I am definitely loyal because I am definitely loyal to Jaison. to Jaison. <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>Yeah, yeah. Definitely. Definitely. <br/>I like Jaison. Even though, man, he's just not... His mind's getting messed up. <br/>I know. <br/>He's getting broke down. <br/>He really lets this stuff get to him. But I just want you to know, Russell, that, you know, I think you have a good  enough vibe from me already that I'm a trustworthy guy, and I'll go by my  word, and I will. And if that's my downfall, then so be it. You know, I want to win. I'm here to win, too--  Then give me your word you won't vote for me and we'll let Ben go next. <br/>All right. After Ashley? <br/>After Ashley. <br/>Look me in the eye. <br/>You've got my word. <br/>All right, done and done. <br/>I want Mick to trust me, and I want him to know how important it is that we  stick together and we can make this work. So, I'm going to let him know about the hidden immunity idol. The immunity idol is a powerful tool, and it is a tool to where this person  would say, well, this person would say, well, this guy must really trust me. this guy must really trust me. <br/>That's some brilliance on your part. <br/>My alliance with Mick is solid. So that's just another vote for me to get Ashley out. It's simple. I was born for this. I was born for this. This is what God made me for. This is what God made me for. <br/>Good job, buddy. You want to start stripping them? You know how to do that? I'm going to show you guys lickety-split. Get it like this. Go. Okay? And then get them like this. And then wrap them. And then take the ends, tie it around, tuck it in, and you have a little  poofy torch. <br/>Sweet. <br/>Okay? <br/>All right. <br/>Just like that. I've been hooking it up and cooking it up at camp today, taught them a few  new tricks that they didn't know. So, you know, trying to be helpful and make good helpful and make good  relationships with these people. relationships with these people. But I need to start looking for hidden immunity idol. I'm going to do a little recon mission and we'll see what we can come up with. Look at all this good firewood, Liz. <br/>Oh. <br/>Holy cow! <br/>Holy cow! Oh, dude! Oh, dude! <br/>I love Shambo. I wish she were over here. She is so nice, and she's bringing a real good energy to us. <br/>Oh, my word, for sure. <br/>I can't believe no one's doing anything at their camp. <br/>It's amazing. Who has time to do yoga on the beach? <br/>It's ridiculous. <br/>It's ridiculous. <br/>My sentiments exactly. <br/>My sentiments exactly. <br/>I noticed the girls are talking a little more, and I will regret not sending  Ashley home because there's no way she ain't going to try to get that  all-girl thing or something. We got to put a squash on that and we got this game under and we got this  game under control. control. That's the plan, dude. I think we got to get rid I think we got to get rid of her. of her. of her. I want to get rid of Ashley. I want to get rid of Ashley. <br/>What's the problem voting Ben off tonight? <br/>I'm on the fence with Ben right now. <br/>Why? <br/>'Cause I know that what if we do a challenge? Is he a strong player? <br/>No. <br/>You don't think he's  You don't think he's stronger than...? stronger than...? <br/>Okay, let's think about the  Okay, let's think about the numbers, then. numbers, then. <br/>I don't like that. <br/>I don't really like that, either. <br/>They will gang up on us. Don't believe they won't. That's the whole thing. That's what I do not like. <br/>Your only concern is the girls voting us three on three? girls voting us three on three? I'm not worried about that. I'm not worried about that. Those girls are so weak it would be suicide if they tried would be suicide if  they tried to pick us off one by one. to pick us off one by one. <br/>And then we'll get rid of Ben. I don't want them to have numbers. You know, right now, it's just You know, right now, it's just not-- and I  know you hate it--. not-- and I know you hate it--. <br/>I know, man. <br/>I'm making my peace at this Tribal Council. That's the way it's going down. If you guys want to have discord in the camp because of the guy who does  nothing in challenges and provides very little at camp then you go right  ahead. And if you leave him here, that's going to be a rough night tonight. That's going to be a rough day tomorrow. That's going to be a rough That's going to be a rough night the next night. night the next night. <br/>I want to keep Ben around, but everybody's saying how he's a poison and this  and that. So it's becoming-- I don't want them not to trust me. them not to trust me. So it's like... man. So it's like... man. <br/>Probst: Shambo, go ahead and  Probst: Shambo, go ahead and have a seat. have a seat. Shambo is just here to observe tonight, not participate in any other way. Jaison, what was it like having a visitor? Shambo's been with you guys for the last day and a half. <br/>I think Shambo's amazing, you know? I would love to propose a trade with Galu and trade somebody for Shambo,  specifically Ben, frankly. You know, she's a positive force in camp while he is an incredibly negative  force. So she's amazing. I love her. She's great. <br/>Probst: Ben, first you vote out Marisa because she's a negative force. Last Tribal Council you vote out Betsy because she's on the outside. And who are you going to vote out tonight and why? <br/>I'm voting for Ashley because I think she's the weakest link in the group. <br/>Probst: Ashley, why would it make sense from a tribe's point of view to get  rid of you? <br/>Honestly, I don't think I'm the weakest one and I'm not bringing a negative  energy around the tribe either. <br/>I don't approach people with negativity. I react. If you come at me nice and sweet, you're going to get nice and sweet. You come at me with some trash, you're going to get some trash. <br/>Here's the thing-- when someone is in camp screaming and yelling at other  people constantly about everything, that puts everyone in a bad mood. <br/>Who have I screamed and yelled at, Jaison? <br/>You have yelled at Ashley. You have yelled at Marisa. You yelled at one of our guests who came. Anybody who asks you a question or tries to do something on their own, you  constantly correct them and tell them they're doing it wrong. <br/>Not true. That's not true. <br/>That's absolutely true. <br/>Is that true? <br/>100% true. <br/>When you have asked me to do things--  Amazing how you always try to go to someone that you think is weak. That's what bullies do. You yell at every single girl. <br/>I'm not a bully. You're a... baby, dude. <br/>Don't ask her. Talk to me. <br/>You have these temper tantrums after every challenge, like, "Oh, I don't  want to be on the team."  "Oh my God, I'm an outlaw. I'm a renegade! They splashed me in the face, I can't tackle anyone now, sorry. I got splashed."  Okay, Ivy League, keep it up. <br/>Who are you trying to kid? Who are you trying to fool? <br/>I'm not trying to kid anybody. <br/>Probst: Natalie, what's it like being in the middle of this? <br/>Um, I was just kind of leaning back just in case fists go flying, 'cause I  don't want it to be me getting hit. <br/>Probst: Russell, you're a guy that likes to get scrappy. Explain to me what's going on between Ben and Jaison. <br/>I think that it's just Ben said some negative things that might have been,  uh, racial. <br/>They might have been racial? Okay. <br/>And it affected the way Jaison thought about him, and that was it. That was the end of the relationship. <br/>Probst: Jaison, you guys still have a chance in this game. You're down four after tonight. But you're not out. Is there any way you could heal this wound? <br/>I just have to draw a line in the sand, and I have to say that, you know,  there is no $1 million that is worth me sitting up here with him anymore. I mean, I sat here and watched him scream at Yasmin at our camp, and over  here, saying incredible things. So is there a way to patch this rift? I don't think so. But I'm not going to sit in camp and listen to this guy anymore. I'm just not. <br/>Probst: Ben, big reaction from him. <br/>I have said from the get-go, everybody knows I've been very, very consistent. I have not started one fight, not started one. <br/>That's not even what I was talking about. I was talking more about the ghetto trash that you tried to call her over  there. <br/>Okay, well, if she's from the ghetto and she's trashy, that's ghetto trash. I'm sorry. That's not racial whatsoever. That's where you're from and how you're acting. That's ghetto trash. <br/>If that's really what you think, Ben. <br/>So if you can't understand that--  Let me make another point, then Southern guy with Southern ways. Do you really think you should talk to a woman that way? <br/>You know what, if she is going to be disrespectful-- Southern gentleman, do  you speak to a young lady that way? <br/>She's not a lady. <br/>Really, she wasn't a lady? I mean, come on. <br/>Ladies have manners, okay? This girl right here, Southern, has manners. Says yes, sir, yes, ma'am, please, thank you. So, Yasmin is being a bitch, then she's not a lady. I mean, it's not that hard. <br/>Okay. <br/>There was nothing racial that I said. <br/>Okay, whatever. <br/>It was strictly what I saw. <br/>If you say so. <br/>How she was acting towards me. So, if you want to call it a racial game and play that card, then go for it,  buddy. <br/>You know, you should have some sensitivity to history, and historically when  certain comments are made and directed toward certain people, it is because  of race. I mean, if what you're telling me is that what you said had absolutely no  racial context, then maybe Yasmin was right and you are ignorant. you are ignorant. Maybe you really don't get it. Maybe you really don't get it. <br/>Probst: Ashley, any time there's heat on somebody else, it means it's not on  you. Gotta make you feel great. <br/>Well, I've known the last couple of days that he's going to vote for me, but  there's definitely other tension, so it does leave it a little off me. But I packed my bags. I mean, you never know what happens in the game. <br/>Probst: Ben, is there anything you've said that you regret and you would like  to say to Jaison now, "dude, I didn't mean anything by it"? <br/>Not anything I can think of. <br/>All right. <br/>Probst: All right, it's time to get to the vote, which means, Shambo, it's  time for you to go. You have certainly heard a lot tonight. What you share with your tribe mates, up to you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. camp. Good night. Good night. All right, it is time to vote. All right, it is time to vote. Mick, you're up. Mick, you're up. <br/>I just really think you need to grow up. to grow up. That's all I have to say to you. That's all I have to say to you. That's all I have to say to you. <br/>You knew it was coming. <br/>You knew it was coming. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes.

You've got to figure out how to turn things around. Or I will be seeing you back here at Tribal Council. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:  I'm tired. I'm hungry. <br/>Probst: Russell gets fed up with Jaison. <br/>What kind of man is that? <br/>Probst: And at Galu...  Wherever the immunity idol is on their beach is probably on our beach. <br/>Probst: It's not so easy to  Probst: It's not so easy to find a hidden immunity idol. find a hidden immunity idol. <br/>Well, I think it's pretty funny that I'm going home because I think  everybody's going to starve. I think it's even funnier that it's raining. 'Cause you guys are going to be wet. I'm really not worried about it. I'm glad I'm getting a nice, dry sleep tonight. The tribe is a bunch of sissies, everybody except Russell. I was the hardest working guy in camp, everybody knew that. in camp, everybody knew that. They'll miss me when I'm gone.
