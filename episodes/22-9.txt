<br/>Episode 9 -  <br/>Jeff: previously on "Survivor": Sarita drops out  of the duel. Matt seized the moment, and will re-enter this game. As Matt's time at Redemption Island finally came to an end, the  tribes were merged. But Matt was unsure about sticking with the tribe that voted him  out or making a brand new alliance. Rob and the former Ometepe tribe had a narrow advantage at 6-5,  but Ralph, from the former Zapatera tribe, had a hidden immunity idol, that  could be used to even things out. <br/>We play the idol and then all we've got to do is reel Matt  in and we're good. <br/>Jeff: At the immunity challenge the situation improved for  Rob when his closest ally won. Mike falls out of the challenge. Natalie wins first individual immunity! And when he finally got all the original Ometepe tribe members  on his side, he was back in complete control. <br/>I don't want to switch. I don't want to flip. If it's god's will he'll take me as far as he wants me to go. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Rob was thrilled when Ralph  played the hidden immunity idol that he should have kept and Matt trusted Rob  again and paid the price, a second blindside. Matt, once again, the tribe has spoken. Matt is now heading to Redemption Island where at least one of  you will have to face him in a duel, and I have a feeling forgiveness, not  going to be on his mind. <br/>First and foremost, I'd like to congratulate myself on  being the most naive person to ever play the game of "Survivor."  fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. So I am reaping the benefits of my-- my shame. I can't believe I got blindsided twice by the same people. Like, I feel like a moron. It's like it's the biggest practical joke in the world that's  being played right now. I'm trying to figure out what exactly your plan is, but I told  you I'd stay here as long as you wanted me to, and I guess-- I guess you  wanted me to come back and say, "Here I am." I trust you. This is your will. You're using my stupidity for glory. So thank you, lord, for this opportunity and blessed be your  name. <br/>A very, very smart play by them last night. <br/>Don't say "Them."  Well, by Rob. <br/>That was, like, straight mob style. <br/>He just eliminated the wild card altogether. <br/>I thought last night's move by Rob was genius. This was, like, a hit straight out of a mob movie. Like, the guy comes back. There's little question about whether or not you can trust him,  but you just welcome him back in and you pat him on the back, you sit down  and you have dinner with him and go out on the fishing boats and kill him. <br/>Hey, Rob? <br/>Yes. <br/>As much as I hated it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It was a brilliant move by you guys last night. <br/>Thanks, man. <br/>Well played. <br/>Yeah. I appreciate it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Man, it's part of the game, unfortunately. <br/>Yeah. Poor kid. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Cold-blooded, man. For them to send Matt back to redemption was just cold-blooded. I mean, do-- it's a game, but do you not have any feeling at all  for a human being? <br/>You got, like, the little--  Superman. <br/>Superman! <br/>So, you know, with people like that playing the game,  there's no breaking that barrier. That's how we feel right now. There's no breaking their loyal shield. <br/>What's that? <br/>Am I on the chop block? <br/>Chop block? Oh, the chopping block? <br/>Am I the one they're going to send home? <br/>Oh, I can't talk about anything like that. We don't know. <br/>Hey, if you were in the top three, I-- I'll definitely  vote for you and not Boston Rob. <br/>You can try, but still we haven't talk-- we haven't  decided yet. Kind of pointless. <br/>All righty. <br/>All righty? <br/>It's a hard-- it's a hard game. <br/>Now since we're merged we have no control, I don't think. That's very aggravating. I have no clue what's going on. They won't let us know nothing. I mean, how can we play a game when we don't even know where to  start? <br/>From here on out we don't decide who's going next until  the very last minute. <br/>Yes. <br/>We're going to do the buddy system. Nobody talks to anybody on their own. Don't even entertain any--  No conversation about us, just the weather and--  We're guaranteed to go to the final six. <br/>Ya! <br/>All of us. Here we go, Ometepe. <br/>One, two, three, Ometepe! Voting Matty off last night accomplished one main goal and that  was bringing the old Ometepe tribe much closer together. I have a whole vision that I'm trying to put into action here--  keeping us versus them mentality, thus, the separate shelters, the separate  eating times. I want my group to hate Zapatera. It's us versus them, and we're better than them. And we're going to be arrogant about it, and we're going to show  it. I'm not. But I want them to. Because I want their votes at the end of the day. <br/>Who? <br/>Ashley didn't tell you what Ralph said to her? <br/>No. <br/>Ralph pulled her aside and was like, "I want you--  like, if you make it to the top three, I'm voting for you." and he was  like are you going to tell Rob? And she said no, he doesn't need to know. <br/>Okay, good. Thanks for telling me. Thank you for being honest. So Natalie just came and told me that Ralph approached Ashley  and said if she makes it to the top three he's voting for her. He's doing that so Ashley makes a case to not vote off Ralph. We're going to vote his ass off anyway. Okay. He's not going to vote for me, Ralph? He's not going to vote for Ashley, because she ain't going to be  there now and it's your fault. Ashley, you could have made it to the end but you decided not to  tell me anything. You have to tell me everything. It's my game. I'm in charge. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! Phillip did you have a collision with a hawk? <br/>No, I didn't have a collision. I had a meditation and through the meditation I asked for a sign  and out of thin air appeared this feather. <br/>Jeff: literally out of thin air? <br/>Out of thin air. <br/>Jeff: So all things look good for you today. <br/>It looks good for the alliance of the former Ometepe  tribe. <br/>Jeff: All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity  challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Natalie, gotta take back the necklace. You don't even want to help me. <br/>I know. <br/>Jeff: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will dig down to retrieve a club and  use it to smash a tile. The first six move on to the next round where you must submerge  your head in a water trough, take in a mouth full of water, then crawl under  the trough, spit the water into a bowl, filling up a tube. The first three move on to the final round where you must solve  a block puzzle. First person to get the puzzle right wins immunity and is safe  at tribal council. Loser, somebody will be voted out and sent to Redemption Island  where Matt is anxiously awaiting your arrival. All right, guys, we'll draw for spots and get started. All right, here we go. First six move on to the next round. Survivors ready? Go! You've got to dig up the club, untie the knots, and then smash  the tile. Everybody doing a nice job. Grant and Rob are through. Hello! Ralph is through. Mike is through. We're looking for two more spots. David working on his knots. Julie working on those knots. Steve working on his knots. David and Julie moving on! Here we go. First three to finish move on to the final round. Survivors ready? Go! You've got to submerge your head, get water, crawl under, and  spit it into your bowl. Grant and Rob doing a very good job. <br/>Yeah, Grant, you're doing it baby. <br/>Great job. <br/>Great job, Grant, keep it up. Keep pushing, keep pushing. <br/>Jeff: Grant very fast in this challenge. <br/>Keep it up, boys! <br/>Jeff: Three people are moving on. <br/>Keep it up, Grant, keep it up, Grant. You're killing it baby, that's it. <br/>Jeff: Grant very close now. Mike very close. One more gulp could do it. <br/>A big one, Rob. Come on, baby, you got it. <br/>Keep it up, Rob. <br/>This is it. This is it. <br/>Jeff: will this be enough for Grant? Grant moving on! <br/>Good job, Grant. Come on, Rob! You got it, Rob! You're almost there! <br/>Mike, moving on! One spot left. Dig! Let's go, dig! Keep going, Rob, come on. <br/>Jeff: Can Rob do it right here? No. David very close. David moving on to the final! It is Grant, Mike, and David in the final round for immunity. Survivors ready? Go. You will recognize this puzzle from our very first challenge. We had a large version of this. Solid colors will be on the inside and the bottom. The pattern will be on the outside. <br/>You got it. <br/>Take your time, Grant. There you go, baby. <br/>Good job, Grant. <br/>Jeff: Two former Zapatera, one former Ometepe. It is one merged tribe but as we found out at the last tribal,  that does not mean everybody is getting along. A win here would be nice at tribal council tonight. Grant doing a nice job. If he's right, he's close. Mike right on his tail. <br/>Come on, Mike. You can do it, man. <br/>Just focus. You got it. <br/>Come on, Mike, you got it. <br/>Doing a good job, Grant. <br/>Jeff: Grant thinks he's getting closer. Big immunity on the line. Grant and Mike both trying to fit their last piece. <br/>Yeah, baby. <br/>Yeah, Grant! <br/>Work it, Grant. <br/>Jeff: Grant thinks he has it. <br/>Yeah, there you go. <br/>Jeff: Grant wins immunity! <br/>I'm horrible at those things. <br/>Jeff: Grant, come on over. [ applause ] nice job, man. <br/>Oooh! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Grant safe from the vote tonight at tribal council. As for the rest of you, somebody will be sent to Redemption  Island. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>Today's immunity challenge was so close, so close. It was, like, well, you know, prepare yourself for tribal  council. It's going to be one of the five of us tonight unless we can  pull off a miracle, a hail mary. <br/>I was looking at you. [ laughter ]  Let's go just jump in and crash their party. <br/>I don't want to do that. <br/>Why has the flagpole moved? <br/>I don't know. It could be a hidden idol. <br/>You know, I think we're all preparing to potentially go to  Redemption Island. We tossed around the idea of trying to see if we can woo some of  the Ometepe tribe, but Rob's got them on such lockdown. I mean, he's like the-- he's like the prison guard. <br/>They're digging at the flag. Let's go dig. Come on. <br/>What? <br/>Come on, come on! <br/>Oh, they're covering it back up! <br/>They're coming back. <br/>Let's screw with them. <br/>What are we digging? I think we interrupted something. <br/>We were just looking for rocks. <br/>Rocks? <br/>I found a couple. <br/>There are rocks over there. All you can eat rocks. <br/>We'll stand back and watch. You might want to go until we hit water. Might be able to get it. <br/>Yup. <br/>Immediately upon returning from the challenge, Mike and I  decided to look under the flag. We had a thought that maybe an idol had been placed there. But the murlonio crime syndicate decide to get shovels out and  dug a few feet deep around the area. By that point in time we had pretty much come to the conclusion  that there was nothing there. <br/>Anything? <br/>No. <br/>Not yet. <br/>I thought there was an idol under the flag, though. <br/>Really? <br/>The Zapatera tribe could really use it. <br/>They came running back, grabbed shovels. They thought we were looking for an idol, and I think Rob thinks  to some degree that we may have found it before-- before they were able to  get back with the shovels. Well, we tried. <br/>Here's the thing-- I still can't shake this idol paranoia. Like, idols are what killed me last time around, and I'm still  struggling with them. I know I have one idol. But last night at tribal, Ralph played his idol. So I believe another idol could be in play at this point. <br/>They're freaking out now because they think we might have  found it under the flagpole. Isn't if fun playing with these clowns over here on this other  tribe? <br/>Tonight, we basically have to make up a vote that could  potentially cost me my "Survivor" life. Let's go around. Who does everybody think? <br/>I would go with Ralph. <br/>But who is our biggest threat at this point? <br/>It's either Mike-- I would either do Mike or David. <br/>David is strategically smart but we also have to think  about who is going to have the best chance to beat Matty at redemption. <br/>Mike. <br/>Mike. <br/>No. David. <br/>So we have to pick someone to vote out tonight knowing the  possibility that person may actually have an idol or somebody else may have  one and give it to that person. This is one of those times in "Survivor" where you  have to gamble. Hold my hand. Hold my hand. Get your buddy. <br/>I have to go to the bathroom. <br/>I have to go, too. <br/>We'll go up here. <br/>I've got to go, too. <br/>Jeff: So, Phillip, your prediction that the feather would  bring good luck to a former Ometepe member came true. Grant wins immunity, safe tonight at the vote. You knew that. <br/>My great-great-grand father, a full-blooded cherokee, came  to me in a meditation, and he told me that was what would happen. He also stated the former Ometepe shall live long in  "Survivor" lore. <br/>Jeff: Mike, there's six Ometepe. There's five Zapatera. You guys are in trouble right now. <br/>You know, you come into a tribal council with zero  options, and it's not a fun situation. <br/>Jeff: Julie, do you look at these six and think somebody  is on the bottom? <br/>Absolutely. It's obvious who we think is at the bottom but they have no  idea. <br/>Jeff: So, then, David, of the six, who is on the bottom? <br/>We think Phillip. <br/>I enjoy being on the bottom. If that's where I am. It's a nice place to be. You can look up and see what's going on. So, if someone said to me, "You're the guy that's always  getting the wood. You're the guy that's always fetching the water." guess  what, being one of 12 members in my family, it's funny. I did that as a child. And you know what, I have a new family right now here on  "Survivor."  That's right. <br/>Matt thought you guys were his family, too. <br/>Jeff: So, Ralph, you're trying to find a way in, but right  now they're just blocking everything. <br/>I'm not going to give up, Jeff. If I'm still here in the morning, I'm going to push like the  dickens. I might get a feather tomorrow. You never know. <br/>It takes courage and determination and knowing when to  hold your tongue to get a feather. <br/>Oh. So you can hold your tongue, right, huh? <br/>Apparently so, I'm still here. <br/>God bless him. He might go out on the beach and a whole bird might fall down  and get a whole bunch of feathers. <br/>Jeff: wow. Mike, what do you make of Phillip's feather? <br/>You know, I think it's an insecurity thing. I think Phillip is struggling to find himself. I don't think he knows who he is. <br/>You're right, I'm just a guy who got a college degree,  became a special agent, working for three separate agencies. I served in the united states army and had the second highest  medal they give during peace time. <br/>Just give it up. <br/>I don't have to give it up. <br/>You sound like a lunatic. <br/>You know what you sound like? <br/>An educated individual. <br/>A guy at the bottom of the cesspool struggling to get out  of it. <br/>Phillip never ceases to amaze me. <br/>Keep being amazed when I see you sail away. <br/>Jeff: I got to say, I really have no idea who is going  home tonight. Do the five of you on the former Zapatera tribe have any idea  who it might be? <br/>I have a pretty good idea it will be one of the five of  us. <br/>Jeff: All right, Grant has the immunity necklace. You cannot vote for Grant. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Mike, you're up. <br/>Phil, you are one odd duck, brother. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now would be the time to do so. All right, once the votes are read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Phillip. Phillip. That's three votes Phillip. Phillip. Four votes Phillip. That's five votes Phillip. Mike. Mike. Two votes Mike. Mike. Three votes Mike. Mike. That's four votes Mike. Mike. Five votes Mike, five votes Phillip. One vote left. Ninth person voted out of "Survivor: Redemption Island,"  Mike. You need to bring me your torch. Mike, the tribe has spoken. You'll head to Redemption Island where you will have a chance to  get back in this game. <br/>Very well. <br/>Jeff: well, it's pretty clear that the former Zapatera are  on the wrong side of the numbers which means you have to keep digging, trying  to find a way in. Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned one more survivor will be voted out  tonight. <br/>Tonight's tribal council was pretty interesting. I think the biggest thing I took away from it is that Phillip is  slowly becoming a very loyal soldier. Which is good for me. [ laughter ] and even when faced with "You're at the bottom  of the pack" comment, by the other tribe, he respond that, "I love  being at the bottom. That's where I'm comfortable." I'm very happy that Phillip  is obeying and doing as he's told and he'll be rewarded for it. Phillip's not really crazy. He's kind of playing crazy. But he is a little crazy. So even this early, I'm still thinking about my end game and the  jury. So as far as Phillip and I go, Phillip's at the top of my list. He's my number one. That's all he needs to know. So Natalie and Phillip are coming to the final three with me. <br/>Thank you, sir. <br/>Could you-- could you and Andrea share? <br/>Yes, absolutely. Thank you. <br/>Everybody thinks Phillip is naive. Phillip is idiot. Phillip is a crazy guy. This is a game. Everybody wants to stand at final with a guy like me who has  been polarizing, insulting, and so knowing Boston Rob the way I know him, he's  thinking, who can I have stand next to me and who doesn't look so pretty? Phil sheppard. But I'm a smart guy. I'm a complex person, and I gotta make something happen. But there's a time for that and now isn't the time. <br/>Today's the day. I have to do something. <br/>Good luck with getting the opportunity to talk. <br/>I understand that. <br/>Okay. That's all I gotta do is go talk to them. <br/>No. You're not going to accomplish anything if you talk to all of  them. You get one shot. You get one try to talk to them. If you don't get some progress on the first chance, then it's  over. Going over there and ruining it now--  That's what I'm saying. You don't know what they're going to do. <br/>Don't do something stupid. <br/>All right. <br/>We need to get this game on the road. Time's ticking. We're getting close on time. We've got to make some moves. <br/>You know, a tribe that sticks together ends together. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>And what they want to have happen--  Until you merge. It's about one on one. <br/>You wanna win the million or you wanna let Rob win it? <br/>I'm really not concerned. <br/>I just want to talk to you, and nobody wants to talk. <br/>There's nothing to talk about. <br/>There's a whole lot to talk about. This is a game. <br/>We're not here to talk about the game with you. If you wanted to talk about your steers and how you started your  farm, we'll be happy to hear it, for a little bit-- for a little bit. <br/>I want to give you my opinion. <br/>Well, we appreciate your opinion. As my grandmother used to say, opinions are like, everybody has  one. <br/>You can talk about like your home and stuff like that. <br/>Yeah but at home, we talk about that when we are somewhere  else. This is a game. We got to worry about a game. <br/>You just came over. I was having a private conversation. Most people say, "Excuse me." anyway, back to our  conversation. <br/>He's so nuts. <br/>When nobody is willing to play the game it's not a lot of  fun. We're just sitting here trying to hang on as long as we can, and  there are no guarantees that I'm not already the next on the list. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Oh! <br/>Jeff: They look good, Phillip? <br/>Oh, yeah, baby. <br/>Jeff: well, I'm happy to tell you that today everybody  will have an opportunity to feast on cheeseburgers. Shall we get to it? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: First things first. Grant, take back the necklace. <br/>My goodness! <br/>Jeff: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you are going to hang from a bar for as  long as you can. After 20 minutes, you'll be allowed to use your legs only. Once you drop from the bar, you're out of the challenge. Last person left hanging wins immunity, is safe at the vote. Losers, somebody will be voted out and sent to Redemption Island. Now to the cheeseburgers. You're going to each take a white rock and a black rock. Take one of each. Individual decision. You're going to keep this secret until I ask you. Black rock means I want to play. I want a shot at immunity. White means I'm eatin'. Everybody put your palms out where I can see them. Everybody reveal. Only two people opting to eat. Phillip is going to eat cheeseburgers. Steve is going to eat cheeseburgers. Everybody else fighting for immunity. We'll draw for spots and we'll get started. All right, go ahead and get in your positions. Everybody looking good. All right, this challenge is on. Start eating. You have 26 burgers over there, and a huge bowl of fries. <br/>I can smell them from here. <br/>Jeff: Rob losing his hat. <br/>Hang in there Grant, Rob. <br/>Jeff: how are those burgers? <br/>Wow, wow. <br/>Jeff: Good stuff? <br/>Amazing. <br/>Jeff: Those burgers better be good. You're giving up immunity and a shot, potentially, at a million  dollars. Rob struggling to get comfortable. Eight people trying to win immunity. We switch to legs only after 20 minutes. Rob can't hang on any longer. Rob is first out. Rob will take a spot on the bench. Now he's going to have to sit within inhaling distance of those  burgers. <br/>Looking awesome, Andrea. Keep it up, Ashley. You guys look great. I'm concerned about David, though, his head is starting to turn  blue. <br/>I'm very, very glad that Phillip is concerned for me. <br/>Jeff: No love lost between David and Phillip. <br/>I have no pRoblem with Phillip. <br/>I have lot of pRoblems with David. <br/>Jeff: Do you think you guys will be friends afterwards, David? <br/>Best friends. [ burps ]  Jeff: All right, we're going to move to legs only. This is going to increase the difficulty quite a bit. You will have to let go of your arms when I count you down. Five, four -- let them go-- three, two, one. And we're good. <br/>Way to go, Ralph. Hang in there big man. <br/>Aarrggh! <br/>Jeff: Julie drops from the bar, cannot hang on any longer. We are down to six. <br/>My leg's going numb. Oh, man! <br/>Jeff: One little touch and you're out. Grant starting to slip. Grant is out. And Ralph is out right behind him. <br/>David, David, David you're locked in. <br/>Jeff: we are down to four. <br/>That's okay, girls hang in there. <br/>David is starting to make little adjustments, guys. <br/>Yeah, it's called scratching my ass [ laughter ]  Jeff: David, the last remaining former Zapatera member  fighting for immunity against the three Ometepe women. You've been up there 45 minutes now. This is all about will power, desire right here. This is not pleasant. <br/>Keep it up, Ashley. <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Way to go, David. Hang in there, brother. <br/>Jeff: I'm sure the circulation in the bottom half of your  legs is long gone. Fight through this pain. Whoever wins this challenge is earning it. There is no question about it. <br/>Natalie, hang in there. <br/>David, David, Natalie's hurting, brother. <br/>Keep hanging, girl. You have two legs on it. He only has one leg. That leg is going to be decapitated. <br/>Keep it up, girls. Keep it up. <br/>Hang in there, David. Be strong. <br/>Yes! [ cheers ]  Jeff: David cannot hang on any longer. David is out of the challenge. <br/>Damn. <br/>Girls. I really want this one. If there's another one--  Will you let it go, ash? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Do it! <br/>One, two, three! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Ashley goes in first, then Natalie, Andrea wins  individual immunity. <br/>Way to do it, girls. <br/>Take a spot on the bench. <br/>Way to go, David. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Good job. <br/>Good job. <br/>Jeff: Andrea, wobble on over here. [ applause ] how are those legs feeling? <br/>Actually, they're feel pretty good. <br/>Jeff: Nice job, great effort. Andrea safe at tonight's tribal council. Everybody else, after 24 days, one of you will be voted out and  sent to Redemption Island, where you'll meet Matt and Mike. You have the afternoon to figure out who it's going to be. I will see you at tribal. Nice job. <br/>I just want to say what a great job we all did today. <br/>A win is always important. I never want to lose. I always like to have an edge. I don't want the Zapatera people to have immunity. I don't want them to have any kind of momentum. I don't want them to feel like they have any power. So as long as someone from our side wins, I'm going to be happy  at this point. <br/>I'm going to look. Hey, we got all kinds of fish! We got 50 fish! <br/>Shut up! <br/>I ain't kiddin'. All kinds of them! Bring a basket. <br/>Are they alive or are they dead? <br/>They're all dead. <br/>If they're dead, you can't eat them. <br/>They're still in good shape. <br/>No. <br/>They're not? <br/>See it? It's like rigamortise already set in. <br/>That won't hurt them. We'll eat 'em. <br/>Okay. <br/>Hell, I caught them on the river banks and took me three  hours to get home before. <br/>Rob is trying to tell his people that fish isn't any good. <br/>They're all soft, still. They're all still soft. <br/>I think Rob just doesn't want his people to take anything  from us. Now, if Rob were to catch all that fish, that would have been a  different story. They would have been feasting over there. <br/>Oh, man. Those big fish are good. <br/>I'll have a little piece of that. <br/>I'm hungry, bro. <br/>The fish is already rotted and dead. <br/>Just don't let it affect your judgment. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's just going to take a day to get these hunger pangs  away. <br/>Here's the thing I'm running my tribe like the army. I'm the general, they're soldiers and they're all doing as  they're told which is a wonderful thing. <br/>Grant, come taste this. It's awesome. <br/>How is it? <br/>Come take just a taste. <br/>Amazing. <br/>There's no food out here, so I'll eat anything, no Matter  what Rob says. <br/>This is a good one. I don't know what the name of this one is. I'm my own man, I make my own decisions. I don't think there's a dictatorship going on. <br/>Grant, we have so much fish. Really. <br/>He's been instructed not to. <br/>He controls their diet. It's amazing. <br/>The Ometepe tribe was told not to eat the fish. I don't know if Rob wants to keep them weak or he just wants to  maintain control over them. It's cult-like. He showed the power that he has by just instilling fear in  everyone with the whole Matt situation. If you give any inclination you're waivering in your loyalty,  he'll cut your head off then and there. So nobody is going to cross him. <br/>I've just got to sleep for a couple of hours. I'm living on a cup of rice, and it's getting really old. <br/>You know, what it comes down to tonight is David or Steve. <br/>I'm not going to last much longer, to be honest with you. <br/>Do I eliminate what I consider the biggest strategical threat  in the game right now, or do I give the old dying t-rex what he wants? Because I think he wants to go home and get rid of Steve, it may  give me a jury vote. I mean, I've been known to have a mercy killing in me from time  to time. Haven't I? <br/>Jeff: Phillip, same feather? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Jeff: have you had any other meditations? <br/>Well, that's part of it. But there's also, for the first time in 22 seasons, a highly  effective and beauteous and glorious operation in effect right now. <br/>Jeff: which is what? <br/>It's called stealth. <br/>Jeff: Stealth r us. <br/>And I am known as the specialist. My principal responsibilities: Infiltrate and supplant  inceptions into the former Zapatera tribe. We have here, Boston Rob, the mineralist. Principal responsibilities -- to develop strategies for  challenging and develop strategic alliances that are impervious. Where's Grant? The destroyer of aspirations. Better than known as the assassin. Principal responsibilities-- to go out and compete destroying  any competitor. And I forgot to mention the three degrees who are highly  effective, formidable, agile, and have supreme abilities to focus their mind  like they did today. <br/>Jeff: wow. Ralph, pretty tough to beat stealth r us. <br/>It is. You reckon his grandfather told him to sit on the bench and eat  hamburgers today? <br/>Jeff: I guess the argument would be does "Stealth r  us" care? <br/>I think it's pretty clear my tribemates know what I bring  to the table. And, yes, it was difficult for them to see me do that but they  know where my heart is. Today I ate and I make no apologies for that. <br/>Jeff: Steve, how about you? What was the rationale sitting out today? This is a time when you need immunity more than ever. <br/>It's just not my thing. I'd last a short time. So I just made the decision to take the food and hope for the  best. <br/>Jeff: Phillip, do you see any of the Zapateras trying to  find a crack in the stealth r us organization? <br/>They are doing what they can to try to make that happen  but our alliance is so strong, we have a buddy system, and it's highly  effective. <br/>Jeff: A buddy system. <br/>They are never alone, ever. They're always with somebody else. Rob has complete control over them. It's not even a tribe. It's a cult. <br/>Jeff: David, at this point, everybody on Zapatera's got to  be thinking one thing-- as long as it isn't me tonight. Correct? <br/>There's that, definitely, but at the same time, with the  numbers the way they are here, it's virtually irsurmountable, so the other  phase of the game, Redemption Island, may be a better tactic to try to  advance yourself that way. <br/>Jeff: All right, Andrea has the immunity necklace. You cannot vote for Andrea. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Andrea, you're up. <br/>Hopefully this works. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay, once the vote are read the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Rob. Rob. Rob. It says, "Please count this as four Robs." it will  only count as one. <br/>I couldn't help but try. <br/>Jeff: That's four votes Rob. David. David. David. That's three votes David. David. David. That's five votes David. Four votes Rob. Tenth person voted out the "Survivor: Redemption Island,"  David. You need to bring me your torch. David, the tribe has spoken. You'll now head to Redemption Island where you will have a  chance to get back in this game. <br/>All right. Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Good luck. Well, if you're a former Zapatera, it's pretty clear-- you have  to continue to try to find a way to crack the stealth "R" us  organization. Anything can happen. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor": Phillip takes  issue with Steve. <br/>You don't start nothing there won't be none. But if you start it, I'm going to finish it. You now called me crazy. That's what happens when some white folks they like to take a  black man and make them crazy when he makes an argument that you don't want  to hear. And you know what I got to say about that? You are crazy. <br/>The last few days have been really frustrating. It seems like every time the wheels start to spin and I start to  be able to play the game, that the brakes get put on it by somebody else. Knock, knock. <br/>Who is that? <br/>David murphy. <br/>What! <br/>Yeah. What is "Survivor" doing to us? I don't know man.
