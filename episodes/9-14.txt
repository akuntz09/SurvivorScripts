<br/> <br/>Jeff Probst: 36 days ago, 18 Americans began the adventure  of a lifetime. (tribesmen shouting) They were marooned at a tribal village on  the remote island nation of Vanuatu. In ceremonial fashion, the castaways  were divided into a tribe of men and a tribe of women. While the women were  forced to watch from the sidelines, the men were given the opportunity to  retrieve a traditional spirit stone used to ward off evil spirits. You have  to get it from atop of that pole. If you fail, the women get it. The rivalry  between the men and the women had begun. (tribes cheering)  <br/>I think the boys got a lot more out of that ceremony than  we did, so we're out for blood now.  <br/>Probst: Survivors ready, go! At the first immunity  challenge, the men's Lopevi tribe had a solid lead over the women's Yasur  tribe.  <br/>Get her through! Get her through!  <br/>Probst: But Chris couldn't make it across the balance  beam, and the women won immunity. Back at camp, the young guys wanted Chris  out.  <br/>It has to be.  <br/>Probst: But Sarge proposed a strategy to keep the older  men in the game.  <br/>The only way we have survival here is if we get rid of the  young people.  <br/>Probst: First person voted out of Vanuatu Islands of Fire,  Brook. Sarge's plan worked. Perceived as a physical threat, Brook was voted  out and Chris was saved. For immunity, go! At the second immunity  challenge...  <br/>Straight, Bubba, right there.  <br/>Probst: ...it was the men who came out on top when Sarge  led Lopevi to victory. Lopevi wins immunity!  <br/>Say my name!  <br/>Probst: When Yasur went to Tribal Council, Dolly was their  first victim.  <br/>If you were not here, we would still have fire...  <br/>Probst: On day seven, Mia and Twila had it out over the  work ethic.  <br/>You stay here five minutes, then your asses go down there  in the ocean, bitch.  <br/>It's your only card, keep playing it.  <br/>Probst: Mia's temper cost her a shot at a million dollars.  And at the next two Tribal Councils, Lopevi lost John P. and Brady.  <br/>Holy...  <br/>Probst: On day 11, an earthquake shook the island.  <br/>Ride 'em, cowboy!  <br/>Probst: And the shakeups kept coming. Sarge, Scout, over  here. Sarge and Scout were chosen to pick new tribes, mixing up the men and  the women. Julie and Twila ended up as the only two women on Lopevi, and Rory  and Bubba ended up as the only two men on Yasur. Twila and Julie fit right in  with the guys of Lopevi. Sarge even made a pact with Twila.  <br/>So we need someone that knows what it means to give your  word.  <br/>I do.  <br/>Probst: But at Yasur, Bubba was uneasy.  <br/>Being in a tribe with a bunch of women, it does make you  nervous because one wrong move, and they'll vote you out.  <br/>Probst: So at the next immunity challenge, Bubba tried to  signal his old tribemates.  <br/>Think about the merge.  <br/>Probst: And Ami caught him red-handed.  <br/>He's making plans with the other team. Can you see Michael  Jordan whispering over to the other team what their next play is? Hell,  no.  <br/>Probst: Bubba got axed. Bubba, the tribe has spoken.  <br/>There we go. Oh, that's what I like.  <br/>Probst: It was becoming clear that Ami was running the  show at Yasur, and on day 15, the tribe followed her lead when she decided to  vote out Lisa. The tribe has spoken. At Lopevi's next Tribal Council, Julie  and Twila joined the older guys and sent John K. packing. We're now one  tribe. On day 20, the tribes merged. Rory rejoined his old buddies and  immediately let them know that Ami was a threat.  <br/>As soon as we got over there, they are like "Rory,  you're gone next. Ami told us that."  <br/>Probst: So the guys once again put their faith in Twila  and Julie when they planned to vote out Ami.  <br/>We got the numbers, we'll be good to go.  <br/>Probst: But the men were shocked when Twila and Julie  betrayed them. The women joined forces and took out Rory. The men were  outnumbered and in big trouble. Sarge was next, then Chad, leaving Chris as  the last man standing. Let's bring in the people you're going to pair up  with. Come on in.  <br/>Uh-oh.  <br/>Probst: When the survivors' loved ones joined them for the  immunity challenge on day 27, Chris told his fianc√©e Laurie that he had to  win. It was a close race, but with the help of her girlfriend Crissy, Ami won  immunity.  <br/>Yeah, baby. But back at camp, everything got turned on its  head.  <br/>We made our decision.  <br/>All right.  <br/>Probst: First, the women decided to vote out Eliza before  Chris, and Twila made a bold commitment to stay with Ami and Leanne to the  end.  <br/>On my son, I swear.  <br/>Probst: But Twila went back on her word when she  approached Chris with a plot to take out Leanne and Ami.  <br/>I'll turn the tide. I'll take the risk right now.  <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, it all came together when Eliza  and Scout joined them and voted out Leanne. The tribe has spoken. The women's  alliance had crumbled.  <br/>Screwed you, didn't I?  <br/>You didn't screw me. I'm still in the game. You screwed  Leanne.  <br/>Probst: Suddenly Ami was fighting for her life.  <br/>I'm competing with all my heart now. It's me all the way.  Room service!  <br/>Probst: When Ami joined Eliza and Chris on a spa  reward...  <br/>Good night, Chris.  <br/>Probst: ...she did her best to get Eliza back on her  side.  <br/>Every single time I've had your back, every single vote I  proved it.  <br/>Probst: But Chris was also working on Eliza.  <br/>We're pure final four and look at our competition: a  60-year-old woman and Twila.  <br/>Probst: Chris wins immunity. Chris won immunity and was  safe for three more days.  <br/>Good job, dude.  <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Ami kept fighting when she when  she confronted Twila about swearing on her son's name.  <br/>I can't imagine.  <br/>I am not the only freakin' person that has lied in this  game. Get over it! You've been had. Screw you!  <br/>Probst: Eliza had a big decision to make. Would you miss  Ami if she was gone?  <br/>Yeah, I'd miss Ami a lot.  <br/>Stop crying.  <br/>Probst: But when the votes came in... 13th person voted  out of Survivor: Vanuatu... Ami was finally dethroned. Chris had come a long  way, but he knew the game was not over.  <br/>It's probably in my best interest to go with you and  Eliza. I'm kind of playing Julie and Eliza; at the same time, I'm playing  Scout and Twila. They're all women. How do you trust any of them?  <br/>You know Scout and Twila are not going to go against each  other. With the two of them, meaning a hundred percent we do not get to the  final two.  <br/>Probst: The heat was on, and no one was safe.  <br/>What's up?  <br/>I don't know. You tell me.  <br/>I think you're a liar, T.  <br/>Who else has been lying?  <br/>You've been trying to plot against me since day one.  <br/>You're driving everybody friggin' nuts. Now, Chris, what  are you thinking?  <br/>What? You know, I'm just laying here, you know, in the  hammock.  <br/>Probst: With tensions boiling over, Chris made one last  move when he guaranteed Julie his loyalty.  <br/>What I'm comparing this to is my friendship with you,  compared to my friendship with Twila.  <br/>Probst: Both Julie and Eliza believed Chris when he said  Twila would be the next to go.  <br/>Chris has proved me right so far, and I just hope he  continues to do so.  <br/>Probst: But at Tribal Council... 14th person voted out of  Survivor: Vanuatu... Eliza was shocked when Chris betrayed his pal Julie and  helped vote her out. Now only four remain: Chris, Eliza, Scout and Twila.  Tonight, they will compete in their final immunity challenges. Two will  continue on to face the jury. One will outlast all the rest and become the  sole survivor. (theme song playing)  <br/>I voted off Julie tonight at Tribal Council, took Eliza by  surprise. Oh, well, Julie had it coming. She pulled a fast one on me after  the merge, I got her back. It's all in good game.  <br/>This is, this is, yeah, this is hard for me... knowing who  to trust.  <br/>It's part of the game, Eliza. Not everyone plays it that  way.  <br/>I know, but I would never say that I thought that somebody  who was still here didn't deserve to be here.  <br/>I don't think you deserve to be here, Eliza. The only  reason you're still here is because you've been riding everybody's coattails  from day one. That's the only reason you're here, period.  <br/>That's not true. That's blatantly not true.  <br/>You have done nothing for the camp. You've done nothing,  but boil freakin' water. You don't deserve to be here in my eyes.  <br/>Well, T, I don't think you deserve to be here. I think,  you know...  <br/>At least I've played the game and worked hard. That's more  than I can say for you.  <br/>Working hard is not necessarily playing the game.  Conserving your energy and kicking ass at challenges. Who's won the most  rewards of anyone here?  <br/>Well, you might as well have all your strength to do  that.  <br/>Yeah, well, maybe that's how I'm playing the game. If you  conserved your energy, maybe you could do better at challenges.  <br/>God dang.  <br/>Probably not, but maybe.  <br/>Probably not, you're right. The only reason you're here,  Eliza, is everybody has used you up to this point. That's the only  reason.  <br/>I think Twila is a dumb bitch. I mean, I just don't want  to see either of the two of them make the final two. I just don't want to see  it. It just kills me if that happens.  <br/>Julie wasn't the answer. That's all there is to it.  <br/>Now, tomorrow, assuming you still... are going to stick  with an alliance to me...  <br/>That's never changed. What I did today was for our  alliance. You'll see, okay?  <br/>I believe you. I believe you.  <br/>Why wouldn't you? Have I ever lied to you?  <br/>No.  <br/>Julie was a player, Eliza, a player. She didn't give a ...  about you. She gave a ... about you when her neck was on the line. She voted  for you, remember?  <br/>Mm-hmm. I know. Yeah, but...  <br/>You think you can get one of them to turn on the  other.  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>I don't know. I don't think much about any of the women  here since the final seven of us were here. I mean, they are all just playing  the game. They turned on each other, and they all got their own opinion, and  Eliza and Twila don't like each other, I love it. It puts a little bit of,  you know, excitement in camp.  <br/>I thought I would be here on day 37, yes, but if you would  have told me that this was the group of people I was going to be with, I  would have laughed in your face. I never would have imagined that this would  be the final four.  <br/>I guess we could get that manioc on. If we don't, we ain't  gonna get to eat it.  <br/>Because there's only four of us left, it's pretty clear,  you know, who is going to stick together and who is going to vote for who at  tonight's Tribal Council. Scout and Twila have been wanting to vote for me  for a very long time, and I think that would give them a lot of satisfaction  to finally do that, so I really need immunity to stay in this game. If I  don't get immunity, I pray that it's Chris who does.  <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to the challenge?  <br/>Absolutely.  <br/>Probst: First things first. Give it up, Eliza. Immunity  back up for grabs. Today, you will take part in the first ever Survivor  vertical maze. You'll make your way up and through this maze collecting ten  pairs of wooden tiles, one pair at a time. When you've collected all ten  pairs and you have them at your station, you'll untie them to reveal ten  letters. Use the letters to form a two- word answer. First person to solve  this correctly wins immunity, guaranteed spot in the final three. You guys  ready to do it?  <br/>ALL: Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Wait for my go. We'll get started. For immunity.  Survivors ready... go! Chris and Twila in first. Eliza right behind. Scout  going to give it a go. Chris going up high. Twila going down low. Remember  your color. Twila back with her first pair. Chris has his first pair; he's  got to get down now.  <br/>Where did they go?  <br/>Probst: Eliza having no luck. Twila at her second pair.  That helps Eliza who just follows right behind. Eliza out with her first,  Twila out with her second, Chris out with his first. Scout, she has her first  pair. Eliza with her second pair, Chris with his second pair. Twila, Chris,  Eliza all with two pairs. Twila got her third pair. Twila racing down with  third pair.  <br/>Watch out, Scout, go.  <br/>Probst: Twila moves into the lead with her third pair.  Eliza has her third pair, getting down. Chris has his third pair. Eliza goes  up high and has her fourth pair; Scout with her second pair. Twila with four  pairs now. Chris has his fourth pair; got to get back to that exit. Eliza  with her fourth pair, Chris with four, Twila has her fifth. Chris has his  fifth. Eliza with five, Chris with five, Twila with five. We're tied up. Twila  up high has her sixth. Chris has his sixth in his mouth, trying to get back  to that exit. Chris moves into the lead with six pairs. Twila trying to get  back to the exit now. Twila with six pairs. Eliza with sixth in hand.  <br/>Ow. Watch out for me.  <br/>Probst: Chris and Eliza keep bumping into each other.  Twila with seven, Chris with seven. Eliza has her seventh. Everybody coming  back with pairs. Twila with her eighth, Eliza with her seventh, Chris with  eight. Scout with three. Chris with nine pairs. He only has one left. Eliza  right behind with eight. She's got two left.  <br/>Where's the other?  <br/>Probst: Twila with nine and Chris with nine. They both  only have one pair left. Chris has his tenth pair.  <br/>Go, go.  <br/>Probst: Twila has her last one. Toss the blanks, there's  one letter in each pair. Looking for two words. A two-word answer. Eliza not  giving up, takes a long jump. Eliza back with her ninth pair. She's got one  left. She's got to find it, then got to get it. Chris already working on it.  Eliza back with her last pair.  <br/>I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it. I got  it!  <br/>Probst: Chris wins immunity.  <br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Final three.  <br/>Probst: All right, Chris, get over here. Big-time immunity,  spot in the final three.  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Probst: Sadly, after 37 long, tough days out here, tonight  at Tribal Council, this game will come to an end. Somebody is going home.  I'll see you at Tribal.  <br/>Back home.  <br/>Back home.  <br/>I'll tell you what.  <br/>Hell of a deal.  <br/>Of course I'm going to say it's a beautiful day, but it  really is a beautiful day.  <br/>It's a beautiful day. That necklace looks good on  you.  <br/>Oh, man, I needed it bad. I never give up. That's the one  thing. I just knew. I'm the last man standing, I'm not giving up on this  game. I'm going to hang this up.  <br/>Right on your tail.  <br/>Twila gave me a run for my money, but immunity is what I  wanted. That's all I needed. It's a good day.  <br/>Go collect as many of these little dead ones till we get a  pile of them.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>I definitely had my work cut out for me.  <br/>Yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow!  <br/>An alliance you've got with somebody or trust-- it's not  meaning a whole lot right now-- it's making that final two and getting a  chance to win.  <br/>Us three.  <br/>Oh, you guys. Listen, I want to tell you guys that I have  wanted this day to come.  <br/>It's gonna happen tonight.  <br/>Whoo! Right now, I just want to gloat. I want to gloat  that the little wench is going home today, tonight. I'm gloating. Chris,  everybody, does this mean I don't need to pack my bags tonight? (laughing): I  know...  <br/>No more. I'm tired of ya asking. Twila is so wound up. You  know, Twila works on me. So, I'm gonna have to deal with Twila all afternoon.  She gets on my nerves. She's just totally out-of- control nervous all the  time. If you want to josh Eliza a little bit here and there, go ahead.  <br/>She was such a smart ass and arrogant bitch last night, it  just pissed me off.  <br/>Get her blood boiling a little bit, because she come down  on you yesterday and was trying to make you look bad.  <br/>I know.  <br/>So just wait about a half an hour before and just ride her  like a dog.  <br/>Thanks, darling. I want to gloat, but that's just what  Chris wants me to do. See, he... The more I piss everybody off right before  they leave, the more easier it is if we're the final two that he gets all the  votes. So, you know, I see what he's doing. He's working it.  <br/>I've been wanting to talk to you so bad because you're the  one that initially come to me and said, "I want to try to keep you in  the game and play the game with you."  <br/>Right.  <br/>And that's, that's what led me to want to just finally sit  down and talk to you.  <br/>I swear to God, I've wanted that since the day I saw you.  Back there, I mean it. I said I want to play the game with that guy right  there.  <br/>It's going to be a long afternoon for sure. Just pretty  much more I've to put up with three women all afternoon, and that sucks. My  alliance is with all three of them, and, you know, they're all bidding for  their spot in the final three. I mean, we're both gonna vote for Twila, and  whatever happens happens. Twila thinks you're gonna go home. She has no idea.  They don't know. I've never told them. No one knows me and you made a pact.  They have no idea.  <br/>I'm lucky enough to be in the final four with someone that  I feel that I can put all of my trust into, and now that we've made this  pact, this final two alliance, neither one of us is going to vote against the  other person, and we're going to do everything we can to get to the final two  together. Have you tried to make a deal with Chris?  <br/>I definitely thought about it. Have you tried to make a  deal?  <br/>Huh?  <br/>Have you tried to make a deal?  <br/>I've tried to make a deal with everyone. But I know that  Twila is already trying to wheel and deal, so I think you should get in on  that, too, because I would rather see you and Chris in the final two.  <br/>You would?  <br/>Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And, yes, call me sour grapes, but...  and I blatantly would rather see people in the final two that I like, that I  would be... I would feel comfortable with either of the two people winning.  I'd feel comfortable with that, as opposed to somebody who I feel like has  lost their integrity throughout this game. So, you want to vote for Twila  with me tonight, huh, huh?  <br/>I thought about it.  <br/>I didn't come here to get second place, and I sure as hell  didn't come here to get third or fourth. I come here to win, you know. I  don't look at myself as being aligned with Scout and Twila right now. There's  no loyalty, no trust. There's nothing in the game right now. It's all about  just getting yourself to the next step. To hell with everybody else.  <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury: Sarge,  Chad, Leanne, Ami and Julie, voted out at the last Tribal Council. 37 days;  hard-fought, long days. Tonight, this game will come to an end for somebody.  That somebody will not be you, Chris, wearing immunity. I don't think I've  ever seen you as excited as you were today. Eliza, do you remember back to  the first challenge, the one guy who couldn't get across the balance beam?  <br/>Yeah, this guy right here. I thought he was gone, first  day.  <br/>You got to bring up the beam, don't you, man? You got to  bring up the balance beam.  <br/>Probst: Well, at this point, it's something you've  overcome now. You're still in this game.  <br/>You're right. Got off to a bad start, no doubt.  <br/>Probst: Eliza, when you see it around Chris's neck, are  you envious or do you think, "Hey, you know, I like him?"  <br/>Well, of course I'm envious, but you know, if I couldn't  have it, Chris would be my next choice for the person to have individual  immunity. I mean, that's no secret. So, yeah, I'm definitely happy for  Chris.  <br/>Probst: And you say it's no secret. You're referring to  the fact that you and Twila have been pretty open about... you're just  different people.  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Probst: And it does seem like there's a friendship with  Chris.  <br/>Yes, yes, we've definitely gotten really close and, you  know, I'm glad that we've gotten to know each other and formed as strong a  bond as we have.  <br/>Probst: Twila, on the other hand, there have been times  out here when you've said in no uncertain terms, "I like these people,  but I don't trust anybody."  <br/>Exactly. I have said that.  <br/>Probst: Still feel that way? You're not that  comfortable?  <br/>Not that comfortable, but maybe I'm wrong, but this is the  first night since I've been here, I've been at ease. I feel in my heart that  I've been at ease, the first night.  <br/>Probst: Scout, this is where it gets really complicated,  because you can't risk telling anybody the truth anyway, because there's too  much time to maneuver out from under you if you do tell them, so everybody  has to keep a secret. Somebody here is gonna be surprised, and yet, Scout,  you don't seem too worried.  <br/>It would surprise me. It could be me tonight, though, and  if it does, I'll go... and get up and get my torch and walk out.  <br/>Probst: Chris, you're a little bit in the driver's seat  because you seem to have relationships with all three of these women.  <br/>Absolutely I have a relationship with all three of these  women, but, you know, I can't take away my focus of playing the game. No  matter if I've developed a friendship with somebody. Friendship... game.  Friendship right there. I'm gonna have to put it back here tonight. It's time  to play the game.  <br/>Probst: Twila, been days out here where you went to bed  and thought, "Okay, I was maybe a little rough today."  <br/>Most definitely, yeah. There's, there's a couple of major  mistakes that I've made out here and I feel pretty bad about. The main thing  that comes to mind is swearing on my son's name, and I'm very ashamed of  that, but I can't take it back.  <br/>Probst: What do you think his take, James, will be on  that?  <br/>If I win a million dollars, he'll say, "Hell, yes,  Mom, you can swear on my name any time you want." But I just shouldn't  have done it. That's the bottom line. I should have never have brought his  name into it. I should have never done it.  <br/>Probst: All right, Chris. You have immunity. At this point  in the game, I think you'd be a fool to give it up probably, but you never  know what somebody's strategy is.  <br/>I am not a fool. I'm not giving up immunity.  <br/>Probst: Okay, you cannot vote for Chris. Eliza, Scout,  Twila-- one of you is about to go home. Let's find out who that's gonna be.  It is time to vote. Eliza, you're up.  <br/>Twila, I am voting for you for the third time this game.  You're like the cockroach that won't die under the refrigerator. Hopefully,  you're going home tonight.  <br/>You have drove me crazy from day one. If you go home  tonight, it's gonna be the happiest night since I've been here. You've got a  lot of growing up to do.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read,  the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal  Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. The first vote-- Eliza. Twila.  One vote Eliza, one vote Twila. Liza. Two votes Eliza, one vote Twila. I'll  read the last vote. The 15th person voted out of Survivor: Vanuatu-- Eliza.  You need to bring me your torch. Eliza, the tribe has spoken. Well, you've  reached a critical point in the game: final three. Tomorrow you'll take part  in the last immunity challenge. The winner guaranteed a spot in the final two  and gets to decide who sits next to them at the final Tribal Council. Get a  good night's sleep. Grab your torches and head back to camp. Good  night.  <br/>I'm definitely disappointed that Chris voted for me. I was  shocked that he wrote my name down when he said he wasn't going to and he,  you know, gave me his word, the whole pact. It turns out I did not have a  single ally this entire game. I look for the best in people, and it's definitely  going to change my outlook and, yeah, that hurts.  <br/>Chris, did you see that look Eliza gave you? If looks was  to kill...  <br/>I mean, I don't know what her problem is. I just stick  with my alliance. That's all I do. I ain't like her. See you later.  <br/>You know what? There is a merciful God, you guys. Liza is  not going to be running her mouth. This night is beautiful because it's  quiet. There is no Eliza noises in camp. It was kind of like getting a thorn  out of your foot or a thorn out of your side, you know? She just drove me  nuts for so long.  <br/>Look up in the sky and look how many stars there  are.  <br/>It's gorgeous.  <br/>I never dreamed I'd be playing the game the way I am,  lying, deceiving. You ain't got no choice because I tell you what. If you  don't step it up and you don't start playing the game in your best interest,  to benefit and go to the end, you'll be sent packing. And, uh, going back  home with a million bucks... that'll change your life.  <br/>Hey, Chris, here comes Jeff. Jeff, I was gonna meet you,  but they don't want to stumble over the rocks.  <br/>Probst: That's all right. I'll come to you. Well, it's day  38.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Whoo.  <br/>Probst: It's time for your final rite of passage. I know  you remember the story I told you recently about Roy Mata, a very famous  chief who was poisoned to death by his brother and then buried along with all  of his chiefs and their wives. Many of them were buried alive, and they were  buried on an island that was then considered so taboo after that burial, that  nobody visited for 700 years. You may have figured it out. If you haven't,  you've been sitting across it for 38 days.  <br/>See, I figured that out.  <br/>That's the island, no way.  <br/>Probst: Aratoca Island, also known as Hat Island for the  shape of it. That island is the most sacred spot in Vanuatu, so it is a  fitting spot for your final rite of passage. You're gonna paddle over. You'll  find 15 torches of the survivors who are no longer in this game. Take a  moment at each one of them to reflect on what impact they had on the game,  what impact they've have had on you, if any. You will then go to the actual  burial site of Roy Mata, make an offering. This is a gesture of thanks to  Vanuatu for our time out here, so bring something of value to leave at this  gravesite. When you're finished, I'll meet you on the other side for your  final immunity challenge. Enjoy this time. I'll see you over there.  <br/>Thanks. Being in the final three is amazing to me, but I  don't know what's going to happen. It's going to be a happy day and a sad day  all up in one.  <br/>At this pace, we ought to get there about noon  tomorrow.  <br/>We're making progress. Brook, he was our first. Really  never really had much of a chance.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>It was a crazy three days. You've got to out-will the  environment, you got to outplay the other people. You get caught in one bad  day, one bad situation, snip, you're gone. And that's what happened to  me.  <br/>Dolly was a very personable young woman and had the most  beautiful eyes I've ever seen.  <br/>My experience out here was short but excellent, um, a  little confusing because I found myself caught in the middle, and I wasn't  able to make up my mind quick enough, and it backfired.  <br/>This whole experience is really going to change the way I  look at things from here on out. I'm going to appreciate those around me  more-- emotionally, spiritually. I'm going to appreciate fire.  <br/>I'm usually pretty good at getting along with almost  anybody, but, again, I'm Italian, I couldn't control the temper and I clashed  with a lot of people. Ultimately it got me voted out of the game.  <br/>I don't know that I could've done anything differently  after the first hour of the game. Things were polarized so quickly. I  probably shouldn't have climbed that damn pole on the first day. Maybe that  would have helped, I don't know.  <br/>Sweet, sweet Bubba.  <br/>Yeah, Bubba was awesome. Me and Bubba planned to stick  together to the end.  <br/>You're not going to always win, you're not always going to  have the best hand, but the important thing is what did you learn getting  there? I never realized that the prize I'd be taking home to my children is  knowing who I am now, that they know who their father is.  <br/>I made a comment that was totally blown out of proportion,  and it cost me the game, but, you know, at least I went out with my word, and  that's what I said I'd do and I did it.  <br/>I'd love to say I'd walk out of here with no regrets, but  I'm a little bummed, I'd have to say. I never thought I'd get emotional in  this game, but I'm a little fired up because I really, really wanted to win  this.  <br/>I don't have a single regret about being out here, because  I played this game. I may not be a million dollars richer, but no one has  enjoyed the experience of being on this land more than I have. Whoo!  <br/>Sarge, good old Sarge. He was definitely our... our  chief.  <br/>My downfall was that I put trust in age over looking  within each person individually and judging them on, you know, their actual  character, because I saw some young people out here that had more character  than some of the older, wise people that I looked up to back home.  <br/>I was doing some soul- searching, and I had to reach down  and find some stuff within me that would allow me to be strong on my own, and  it ran the gamut from suffering to joy-- just the whole gamut of emotions. It  was just amazing, so, yeah, I was able to find out, yeah, I'm a pretty strong  guy.  <br/>There are days when I thought: Why am I just not at home  on my couch watching TV, eating chocolate cake? But it was so worth every  minute of it for me.  <br/>Then there was Ami.  <br/>Coming into the game, my strategy was to get the women to  stick together, and I have to admit we created a very powerful force. We were  definitely a force to be reckoned with.  <br/>Jules.  <br/>Old Jules.  <br/>The little sister I never had.  <br/>It's kind of a mental battle to know what to expose and  what not to. These people, some developed into friendships, but they are also  your competitors, but you have to keep persevering, and I did at the end, and  I feel good coming out of it.  <br/>What do we say about Eliza?  <br/>What haven't we said about Eliza?  <br/>Looks to kill at Tribal Council, that's for sure.  <br/>This was definitely the best experience of my life. I  mean, I don't think I could have asked for anything more, well, except, you  know, to make it to the final two, but day 37 is nothing to be ashamed of,  and I loved the game, loved the competition, even the fights.  <br/>This is where the chief...  <br/>Oh, my goodness... Wow...  <br/>...was buried alive.  <br/>Whew!  <br/>The shells have definitely aged. Well, as they welcomed us  to the islands, that ceremony the opening night, they blessed us and gave us  the opportunity to have this as luck, and I'm going to let them have their  spirit idol back.  <br/>And we were also given this chief staff and it looks to me  like maybe there's a chief and a chieftess. I'm not sure how it goes, but  I'll leave that scepter right there in honor of a man who actually gave his  life on behalf of peace.  <br/>Thanks for letting us stay on your island, keeping us  safe. I just want to offer this staff.  <br/>The thing that I felt is that I knew my feet were walking  the trail that indigenous people have walked for hundreds and hundreds of  years. I had a very special feeling of being part of a history that I didn't  know about, but I had-- I have respect for.  <br/>To the chief. Thank you for letting us stay on your  islands.  <br/>Hey, hey.  <br/>To the chief. (Scout speaks foreign language)  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. All right. You ready for your  final immunity challenge?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Probst: First things first, Chris. Give up immunity. For  the last time, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's immunity challenge,  you will use a bow and arrow. You will strike the warrior pose. You will  bring it back to the ready position and a white paper marker will fall down  in front of your arrow. You want to hold this position for as long as you can  endure, because when the pain gets too much, you will release the tension and  you will pierce the marker and you're out of the challenge.  <br/>Oh, man.  <br/>Probst: In addition, if at any time either of your feet  hit the platform, you're out of the challenge.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Probst: For the winner, guaranteed spot in the final two  and a very big decision at tonight's Tribal Council: Who will you choose to  sit next to you at the final Tribal? Had a long paddle in, you had a long  walk through uneven terrain, let's see how much willpower you have left. You  will be doing this barefoot. Take off your shoes. We'll get started. Here we  go. Three, two, one, pull them back, drop the marker. We are on. Do not lose  your concentration. Don't let your mind drift. There's very little play. You  let go for a moment, it's over. As if right on cue, the sun is coming out,  making a tough challenge even tougher. Fight through it, it's going to be  tough in the beginning. Get through that first stage. 38 days you've been out  here. Now is not the time to fall asleep. Scout has pierced her marker. She's  out of the challenge. Take a seat on your platform. You're down to two: Chris  and Twila. Twila uneasy on the stumps.  <br/>Oh...  <br/>Probst: Twila with a good save. Just about fell off.  <br/>You know the outcome, Twila.  <br/>Probst: And the deal-making begins.  <br/>It's as good as gold, Twila.  <br/>Probst: Twila not responding.  <br/>Talk to me, Twila.  <br/>Come on, Chris, give it up. You had it last time.  <br/>Hey, Twila, I proved to you two times in a row, man. You're  the one that turned your back on me at Lopevi.  <br/>I might fall off this thing and ram this thing through my  ass, but I sure as hell ain't going to step down off this pole.  <br/>Hold your focus, Twila.  <br/>Scout's telling you to keep your focus, Twila.  <br/>It's all part of the game.  <br/>Speaks volumes, especially with Scout cheering you on, so  I think I know where you're coming from. You'd better stay up there.  <br/>Probst: Challenge is on.  <br/>Challenge is on.  <br/>Probst: How long do you think you guys have been up  there?  <br/>I have no idea, but I'm sure you're going to tell me,  right?  <br/>Probst: 55 minutes.  <br/>Sweet. Scout, you dreaming about Twila winning?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Feeling it in your forearms?  <br/>Sure.  <br/>Probst: How about you, Chris?  <br/>No, it's too early. I'm not feeling nothing yet.  <br/>Probst: Buy that, Twila?  <br/>No, not at all.  <br/>Probst: So, Chris, if there's so much trust, why aren't  you stepping off?  <br/>Exactly.  <br/>Because I want to win.  <br/>"Because I want to win."  <br/>Damn, that heat feels good, doesn't it?  <br/>Love it. It's like being by the paver back home.  <br/>Gosh, dang it.  <br/>Probst: Twila, pierced your paper marker. Chris wins the  final immunity.  <br/>God, yeah!  <br/>Probst: Chris... well-earned.  <br/>Yeah. Couldn't come at a better time. No, it  couldn't.  <br/>Probst: Final immunity is yours.  <br/>Final immunity is mine.  <br/>Probst: So, tonight, Tribal Council-- one of these two is  going to the final Tribal Council with you. You have the afternoon to figure  out who that is going to be.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Probst: Good effort. Long day. Head back to camp,  guys.  <br/>I pulled it off. I got immunity. I'm still pretty shocked.  Twila was some stiff competition in that challenge, but there was no way I  was losing, no way I was losing. Long day.  <br/>Really long day. There's water. I'll set it out for you  guys. You can have all you want.  <br/>Chris and I, we had an agreement for the final two. If he  won, he would take me; if I won, I'd take him. I don't know if he will now,  because I feel like maybe he thinks I tried to hang into that challenge just  so I could take Scout with me, but it's not true. I wasn't trying to win it  for Scout; I was trying to win it for me-- for me, my own self.  <br/>At that challenge, Scout cheered on Twila and said  "Hang in there." Scout was praying to the gods Twila won that  immunity. Scout wanted to go to the final two. I guarantee you, they had a  pact, and if I find out they did, Twila ain't necessarily going to the final  two. I need you to be honest with me, Scout, because I'm going to tell you  right now...  <br/>Okay.  <br/>I don't know who I'm picking.  <br/>Don't play me, Chris, 'cause I-I really just...  <br/>I'm not playing you, but you need to be honest with  me.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Because I feel like I've been played. Did you and Twila  have an agreement to go to the final two together?  <br/>No. We had an agreement to go to the final four. We had an  agreement that we would take Liza out.  <br/>I'm startled. Twila told me the truth, and I didn't  believe her. I figured that you two had an agreement.  <br/>No.  <br/>I couldn't believe how honest Scout was. Scout definitely  is smart enough to realize why I was asking her, "Did you and Twila have  a pact to the final two?" She could have very easily said,  "Yeah," and Twila would have been packing tonight for sure, but  she's honest, and I respect her for that. Ah, that did it. The bottom line  is, there's people on the jury that's going to base their vote on likability  and there's players going to base their vote on who played the best game and  it's something I can't predict.  <br/>Hey, Chris, one big hug.  <br/>I don't know if I'm gonna take Twila or Scout to the final  two, I don't know. My decision could be made at Tribal Council tonight.  <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury--  Sarge, Chad, Leann, Ami, Julie and Eliza, voted out at the last Tribal  Council. Long day.  <br/>Very.  <br/>Very long day.  <br/>Probst: And then you had your final immunity challenge  with obviously a lot at stake, so let's go through that. Chris, the minute  Scout goes down, you start talking, "Let's make a deal."  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Only the deal you wanted to make was for Twila to  step down.  <br/>It was the perfect deal for me, you know. If she steps  down, then you know, we both get to rest, but Twila is very thick-skinned and  doesn't give up and she fights to the end, and when Scout said, "Hang in  there," I didn't think we were so good after Scout said that, so I  wasn't about to step down, and I don't blame her for not stepping down.  <br/>Probst: So, this afternoon, you're a popular guy. You've  got immunity, not a better spot to be tonight than the one you're sitting in.  Did you get approached?  <br/>Um, actually, no, I did not get approached. We went back  to camp and they both understood that I was... I was holding the deck of  cards and, you know, I was the only one that was going to play and, you know,  I've still got a decision to make, so...  <br/>I just feel extremely good about both of these people.  There can't be a bad outcome in this game. They are just amazing  people.  <br/>Probst: Twila, could there be a bad outcome for you  tonight?  <br/>Most definitely. I played the game hard. I've wanted to  win from day one. I've done everything I can to get where I'm at now, and I  don't want to settle for third.  <br/>Probst: Chris, when you hear the two different sides--  Scout on one hand saying "I'm happy, it's fine." Twila saying  "I am not done"-- that obviously has to factor in a little bit to  you, because you're making a $900,000 decision tonight.  <br/>Well, I listen to that and I respect the way Scout got to  this point in the game. You know, Scout mentally played the game strong, and  Scout was willing to change the game, not only for her benefit, but for other  people's benefit, and I look at that and then I look at Twila, and I see how  aggressive Twila was in playing the game. She did what she had to do to get  to the final three-- whether it be lie, tell the truth, be loyal, break an  alliance, it didn't matter-- and she admits that. But I'm not going to look  at how they played the game. I'm looking at how I played the game and I've  got to finish.  <br/>Probst: Then let's get to the vote. You cannot vote for  Chris. That means, Twila, you can only vote for Scout; Scout, you can only  vote for Twila. Your votes cancel each other out. You won't vote. Chris,  you'll cast the only vote and you will do two things simultaneously. You will  vote out the 16th person from this game, and you will decide who's gonna sit  next to you at the final Tribal Council. You will in effect choose your  opponent. It is your vote. Go make it. I'll go get the vote. Once the vote is  read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the  Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the vote. The 16th person voted  out of Survivor: Vanuatu... Scout. You need to bring me your torch. Scout,  the tribe has spoken. You've gone as far as you can go in this game on your  own. The power now shifts to these six jury members and Scout, who becomes  tonight our seventh jury member, now hold your fate in their hands. We will  reconvene for one final Tribal Council tomorrow night. In the meantime, you  have one night left. Enjoy it. You've earned it. Grab your torches. Head back  to camp. Good night.  <br/>I feel really good about how I played the game. I  maintained the loyalty and integrity as long as loyalty was there to embrace  and when it wasn't, I embraced another alliance and was able to turn the game  around, make it a whole lot more exciting and fun, and I feel really good to  have gotten this far and wish Chris and Twila the very best.  <br/>This is the last pot of manioc I'll ever make. This is  probably the last time I'll ever eat manioc.  <br/>With any hope. This is day 39. This is it. I made it. I  turned things around in my favor and it paid off.  <br/>I am definitely feeling stress on a day that I never  imagined I would feel stress. I was ready to get up today and enjoy the  entire day, and I found myself thinking, "I've got to keep playing the  game." I've been thinking about Tribal tonight.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I ain't gonna take no crap from any of them, are  you?  <br/>I'm going to try not to.  <br/>I mean, they're not going to run me in the ground because  I lasted longer than them. And I mean, I just know how you are. Twila is  extremely outspoken, and I can use that to my advantage tonight. I mean, I  want them to remember exactly how Twila was: just a cutthroat,  didn't-take-no-crap kind of player. I just think about some of the people on  the jury taking their disappointment out on us.  <br/>They will.  <br/>I really don't know if I'm inclined to sit there and let  them do that. I mean, I'll just sit and think, "Well, I know Twila ain't  gonna take no crap, so I'm not gonna take no crap."  <br/>I'm not.  <br/>Great, Twila, you let them know you don't give a crap and  that you come here to win. Chris isn't gonna do that. Chris is gonna sit back  and let Twila put the last nail in her coffin.  <br/>I'm a little apprehensive about tonight. I honestly feel  like I deserve a million because I did play the the game the best. I didn't  suck up to anybody. I didn't pretend to be something that I wasn't. Don't  hold it against me because I outwitted and outplayed you. I deserve their  votes just as much as Chris.  <br/>I think I'm ready.  <br/>Back to reality reality.  <br/>That's right. It's over with after tonight, okay?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>No way is this party coming to an end.  <br/>Whoo. (Chris grunts, Twila laughs)  <br/>What an ending.  <br/>(laughing): I haven't laughed that hard since I been here,  I don't think.  <br/>The closer Tribal Council gets, the... absolutely the more  concerned I'm getting. You know, in the back of my head, I just keep thinking  "that women's alliance," you know? All of them might just say,  "Hey, look, the only way we can prove this women's alliance worked is  for a woman to win this game." And just out of spite, they can vote for  Twila.  <br/>Isn't it funny how I'm actually going to probably miss  this place?  <br/>It's been wild, ain't it? * (bird twittering)  <br/>The sense of pride that I come out and played this game,  when I get out of here, is gonna be with me for a lifetime. Everything that I  will be able to take home with me: the memories, being by the ocean and  seeing things and doing things I've never seen and done before, it's been...  it's been an amazing adventure.  <br/>It's kind of ironic, you know, at the Alinta camp when  there was six women and just me. I wasn't in charge, I wasn't the chief. I  wasn't making the calls, and that's the opposite of what this place is all  about, you know-- that's their heritage, that's what they believe in. And now  it's down to me and a woman. If, unfortunately, I get second place, being the  last man in the game, that's an accomplishment in itself. I never dreamed I'd  be... I'd be where I'm at, no way. And it's still hard, you know, it doesn't  quit. I guess it will quit when I walk off this island and it's completely  over.  <br/>Probst: We now bring in the members of the jury: Sarge,  Chad, Leann, Ami, Julie, Eliza and Scout, voted out at the last Tribal  Council. Chris, Twila, welcome to your final Tribal Council. One bit of  business to do. Immunity necklace. Immunity not back up for grabs. First, let  me say congratulations. You two have done what 16 other people were unable to  do in this game: make it to the final two. But now, after 39 hard-fought  days, the game takes a twist. Your jury, made up of seven people that you had  a hand in voting out, now control your fate in their hands, and based on  tonight's final Tribal Council, they will decide which of the two of you they  think is most deserving of the title of sole survivor, and more importantly,  the million-dollar check that goes along with that. Tribal Council is where  you are held accountable for your actions. Expect to be held accountable  tonight. That's why we're here. Here's how it's going to work. You two will  get a chance to make an opening statement. This is your first opportunity to  plead your case to the jury why do you deserve the title of sole survivor and  the million dollars. The jury will then get their first chance to address you  since being voted out. Once the jury has asked you their questions, you will  get one last opportunity to make a closing statement, and then we will vote.  Clear?  <br/>Yep.  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Probst: Chris, opening statement to the jury.  <br/>I think I, you know, I think I deserve to win as sole  survivor for, you know, many reasons. I think besides not only being loyal to  the alliances that I made throughout the game, I think I'm the person that  overcome more odds than anybody. I was the last man standing with six women.  I just think I deserve to win this game because of the odds I overcome.  That's all.  <br/>Probst: Twila.  <br/>I came to this game with one goal, and that goal was to  win a million dollars to better my life and my son's. I played the game to  win, I played it hard. I know I didn't do everything that I should have done  and should have done more in some other incidents, but it came from my soul.  Everything I did was to win this million dollars, and that's why I believe I  should be the sole survivor tonight. I believe I've earned it. I worked hard  for it. That's all.  <br/>Probst: All right. Jury, in a moment, you're going to get  your first opportunity to address Chris and Twila since you were voted out of  the game. Give you a minute to think about what you want to say.  <br/>Probst: All right. Jury, it is now your chance to address  Chris and Twila for the first time since you've been voted out of the game.  Eliza, you're up.  <br/>Um, before I address my question to you, I have a couple  of comments. Twila, I'll start with you. Congratulations. You achieved what  you set out to do. You came into this game, saying you would do whatever it  took to get to the final two, and that you did. You were a deceptive, lying  bitch throughout this game. You never treated me with an ounce of respect.  You didn't even speak to me like I deserved your breath. I might envy your  position in the final two, but I do not envy your life. Now, with that being  said, I do think you played a good game, and you were outright about it.  Chris, you, on the other hand, you shocked me. You shocked me. Whereas I knew  Twila was going to be a deceptive, lying bitch, I did not know that you were  a deceptive lying bitch, too. You pretended to be my friend. I mean, you  stabbed me in the back with the Julie thing and then you stabbed me in the  back again and rubbed salt in the wound-- unnecessary, blatant lies! My  request tonight from the two of you is, I would like an apology. Twila, you  first.  <br/>Eliza, I never talked to you with any disrespect when you  respected me. I never said any bad words to you until the latter part of this  week, not at all.  <br/>You're right. You just said mean and hateful and spiteful  things behind my back.  <br/>All I said was, you talk too damn much, and you do.  <br/>That's a lie.  <br/>What else was I supposed to have said, Eliza?  <br/>What? Oh, my God. Should I start listing things?  <br/>I'd like to know.  <br/>You said that I didn't deserve to be here, I was a spoiled  brat, um, that I...  <br/>But did I not tell you that to your face? And I did tell  you how I felt.  <br/>Is this, is this an apology? I mean, if you don't feel  that I deserve an apology, then fine, fine.  <br/>I'm just getting to the point. You feel that I'm a lying,  deceptive bitch, well, I think you're a spoiled, rotten little child. And if  you don't owe me an apology for how you feel about me, why should I apologize  to you for the way you feel about me?  <br/>Okay.  <br/>And I just don't feel like I owe you an apology, no, I  don't.  <br/>Okay. Chris?  <br/>Eliza, when I made that pact with you standing there, I  didn't intend to do you wrong. I did it as strategy, and you're right, I owe  you an apology. I broke our pact and I am sorry.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Probst: Thanks, Eliza. Julie. (Julie sniffles and sighs)  <br/>I thought I'd at least get one sentence out before I  started to cry, but I'm feeling abnormally emotional tonight, so... (sighs  heavily) Um, Twila, I saw all your tactics, antics and, I mean, I tried to  get you out of the game, like what, five, six times... My energy is directed  towards Chris tonight...  <br/>Okay.  <br/>...in the fact that I'm either voting for Chris or against  Chris. So, I just want to let you know.  <br/>That's fine.  <br/>(sniffling): Christopher, um, you approached me as a  friend and asked for help with everything to lose. I helped you as a friend  with nothing to gain for myself, and you were the one person who I gave the  opportunity to hurt my feelings. Surprise. I'm here crying. Um, so I have two  questions for you. First off, there are several occasions where I described  our relationship, brother-sister, and I don't understand why you had to doll  it up that much, to look me so solidly in the eyes and base things on our  friendship and on things that I felt were real. So, that's my first question.  <br/>Julie, you are absolutely the hardest decision I  made.  <br/>Okay, great, like fabulous, but why the story? It was so  elaborate.  <br/>Because at the time I had no intentions of writing your  name down; at the time, my intentions were for me and you to stick together.  You looked out for me, you know, and I felt like it was my turn to look out  for you.  <br/>It was.  <br/>I lied to you, Julie, and, I mean, I can't take it  back.  <br/>Okay. Second question: When did you start playing me? And  I want the truth, because this is it. I'm not set on who I'm voting for. I'm  pissed off at you, so tell me, what was authentic about our relationship and  you?  <br/>I didn't play you, Julie. I lied to you and I let my heart  get in the way, and at the end, I didn't even know if I was going to write  your name down and decided at the booth, I just... I played the game. I did  you wrong, Julie, and I'm sorry I lied to you. If you disregard anything to  do with me, I understand, but I truly looked at you as a little sister  and...  <br/>That's enough. That's okay.  <br/>I'm sorry.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Probst: Thanks, Julie. (Julie sniffling)  <br/>Probst: Leann, you're next.  <br/>Twila.  <br/>Yes.  <br/>One of the turning points in the game particularly for me  was when you decided to turn your back on a four-person alliance and vote me  out, and on the day you decided to do that, you reinforced your loyalty to  me, this time using the words, "I swear to you on my son's life that you  have my word." Could you explain to me your thought process in betraying  my trust in our alliance, and why I should reward you for it with a million  dollars?  <br/>I felt that it was supposed to be Leann, Ami, Scout and  myself. I felt when you all turned your back on Scout and brought Julie into  the alliance, I felt that you could easily have turned your back on me at any  time.  <br/>Even though I never did anything to... to make you doubt  my trust?  <br/>I didn't trust you all anymore after you brought Julie in,  I did not. I am sorry for that, because I did trust you. Ami, I never fully  trust full wholeheartedly, but I did trust you. But when you brought Julie  into it, I felt like, you know, it's gonna be you three and I'm the one  that's going to be sitting on the outside, and I couldn't do it. So I had to  change the strategy and that's why I did what I did in the end, not out of  disrespect for you.  <br/>Fair enough. Chris. It's no secret that from day one, I  was pretty much hard-core with the women's alliance, and my intention was to  see that through to the end, no matter what. Convince me to abandon that way  of thinking and vote for you tonight.  <br/>When we merged, I knew without a doubt, you know, my work  was cut out for me. If I wanted to stay in this game any longer, then I had  to look for an opening and a backdoor opened by who else? Twila come to me  and offered me a chance to further myself in the game, and I took advantage,  you know, when the opportunity came. I just feel like I persevered, and I  think that is the reason why, you know, I think I'm deserving to win the  game.  <br/>Thanks.  <br/>Probst: Ami.  <br/>Right now, I just see some serious irony in that. Twila,  even though you had a chance to totally and completely make an apology that  maybe you didn't believe in, for a million dollars you wouldn't do it, but  you'd lie for a million dollars, you'd break friendships for a million  dollars. You say, um, just didn't really trust Ami. I don't know where that  came from, because you had 100% of my loyalty. And, Chris, I'm still just  baffled at why you took the time to flat-out lie to two people for no reason.  I don't understand it. Chris, I want to know from you first what attributes  you think you have that put you in the seat there, and that you think I don't  have putting me standing right here?  <br/>I really don't see me having any qualities any better than  you when it comes to this game, I mean, absolutely not. I think that you're  on the jury because you have a soft heart. I think you're on the jury because  I didn't give you a break. You give me a break. You've let your guard down,  you put personal feelings in front of the game, and, you know, it was your  demise.  <br/>Thank you. Twila, same question.  <br/>First of all, I want to start out, if you don't mind, by  apologizing to you and Leann for swearing on my son's name. I should have  never brought him into it, I should never have done that. I thought of the  game and I thought, now, either they're going to respect me for the decision  that I've made to further myself in the game and that's why I'm here, but now  I'm this low-life bitch that nobody likes and I don't understand that.  <br/>Twila, you flat-out lied to us. You flat-out straight to  our face said, "I'm your friend...  <br/>I did.  <br/>"...I'm going to be here till the end." That's  what you did to both of us.  <br/>That's not the way I see it. I feel like...  <br/>I want to hear the answer to your question. Why are you  sitting there and why am I standing there?  <br/>Maybe a little bit more harder, a little bit more colder,  maybe. You don't have it in you. And I have it. I wear it on my sleeve. It's  not... I haven't tried to hide it from any of you all and maybe that's why  I'm here, and you're there.  <br/>Probst: Thanks, Ami.  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>Probst: Chad, you're up.  <br/>Twila, I'll start with you. I want you to think about your  experiences out here the past 39 days, and I want you to think about  something that's changed you.  <br/>If you're talking about in a bad sense, I need to watch  what I say and how I come across to people, because I've always felt like  I've had to defend myself all the time, so maybe I need to ease up, back off.  I'm a little hard and quick to judge sometimes, and that's not a good  thing.  <br/>Okay. Chris, same question.  <br/>Without a doubt, the one thing that's changing me as a  person is experience in playing the game with the final nine people and  seeing the genuine qualities people possess when there's a million dollars at  stake and how those genuine qualities never falter. In the latter stages of  the game, I found that the money started talking. I started looking at  getting to the end no matter what, and I feel like the two people that  possessed the least amount of those qualities are sitting right up here, and  I look at the seven people on the jury-- everybody sitting over there  possesses a genuine quality that they look past the million dollars, and  that's something I didn't do, that's something I'll take with me to try to  become a better person.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Probst: Thanks, Chad.  <br/>Thanks.  <br/>Probst: Sarge.  <br/>Uh, basically, touch√© to both of y'all. You outwitted, you  outplayed, you outlasted me. I'll start with Twila. First and foremost, I  hold myself true to my beliefs and my values-- loyalty, duty, respect and  honor-- and I only surround myself with that type of people. I wouldn't want  to see you on a street. I wouldn't want a phone call. I would never want to  see you again, okay, but congratulations because you outplayed me. Now,  getting on to my question. After I sat here and listened, you need the  million dollars, and I'm 99% sure right now, you're probably going to get my  vote, okay, but I've got to know-- a million dollars, is that the price tag  to cast your son's name straight to hell? Is the price tag for casting his  name to hell worth a million dollars? 'Cause you say that you hope that your  son forgives you. If my mother did, I'd tell her to kiss my ass, okay? So,  just tell me yes or no, is the price tag $1 million?  <br/>No.  <br/>Okay, Chris. Right now, she needs my help because she  needs to buy back that doggone respect, so right now, you're probably not  going to get my vote. What I need to know is, where does my friendship stand  with you, and does it still stand strong as it was before you found out that  I wasn't going to give you a million dollars and will we be sitting at a race  someday?  <br/>There's not a price on our friendship. We developed a  friendship from the time we met. We connected. I don't care if you vote for  me or not. We'll be friends after this game. Give your vote to Twila, I  don't... We'll be friends after this game. We'll sit in Charlotte and watch  the race. That's a fact. You've got my word on it.  <br/>Cool.  <br/>Probst: Scout.  <br/>Twila, you and I formed an alliance the very first night.  Chris, I've been with you 38 days into this game, and I've been with you as  each of these members came off, so I know your true response to each of these  fallen comrades, and Twila, to your credit, you're not able to bull... very  much, but I value the integrity of your ability to still speak your truth  even though it trips you up and gets you in trouble sometimes. You can't not  be Twila. And Chris, you are bull up to your ears! (chuckles) I'm not sure  where that takes you except that it sits you right where you are. Thanks for  the 38-day ride. It was great.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Probst: Thanks, Scout. Thanks, jury. Well, Chris and  Twila, you guys have been through the wringer. Based on everything you've heard  tonight, you know where they're coming from. I'll give you a second to think  about your last words to the jury.  <br/>Probst: Okay. Twila, Chris, you've heard from the jury.  The jury has definitely spoken tonight in very clear terms. You know what is  on their mind. This is your last chance to change a mind. Twila, you're  first.  <br/>I didn't come into this game intentionally wanting to  deceive or to lie to anyone. I don't do that back home and anybody that knows  me knows my word is good. Whether you believe that or not, it is good. All I  thought about since I've been here is bettering my life. That's all I've  thought about and how I can do it. I didn't worry about your feelings, I  didn't worry about your feelings, none of you. That was selfish and self- centered  of me. People kill for less than what we're playing for right now. Maybe that  sounds hard or cold, and it actually turned me into somebody I don't like.  Sarge, you don't have to rub it in. You don't have to make me feel any lower  than what I already feel for doing what I did. You don't understand how  that's bothered me. I highly respect you and to hear you say that just kills  me. (voice breaking): I apologize to each and every one of you. It wasn't the  game I intended to play. It was the game that ended up playing me, and, uh...  if I could do right again, I would, and for that I apologize. If you can  forgive me, then maybe I can forgive myself. That's all.  <br/>Probst: Chris.  <br/>Scout, you called me out. I'm a bull... But you made me  realize one thing. I can't bull... a bull... Good point. Julie, alls that  matters to me is, it ain't your vote, that's for damn sure. I would just like  to mend some fences, and I did you wrong, and you still are like my little  sister. And I brought you your hat. Eliza, you are absolutely right, I  definitely owed you an apology. What happened with you and Julie makes me  feel like I don't deserve to be sitting here, that any one of you would  probably deserve it more, and that's no bull... I truly feel that way, and I  just want to tell you again I'm sorry. 'Cause you give me your word and  there's no doubt in my mind, you'd be sitting right here if it wasn't for me.  I was your demise. Ami and Leann, I came across an opportunity in the game  and I got to sneak in the backdoor because of the very person sitting to my  left and because of Scout. They changed the alliance. They changed the course  of the game, and I took advantage of it. You're both sitting there because I  did what I had to do to benefit myself. Chad and Sarge, no matter how you  vote tonight, I still made two dear friends, so just vote from your heart,  you know, just feel good about who you vote for, that's all.  <br/>Probst: Okay. It is time, finally, to get to the vote.  It's a little different tonight. Tonight you are not voting somebody out of  the game. You are voting for a winner. Chris, Twila, you want to see your  name on that parchment tonight. It is time to vote. Sarge, you're up.  <br/>Psych. I had to know where our friendship stood. You know  where I stand: honor, integrity. Good job.  <br/>Twila, thank you for the experience of a strong, unspoken  women's alliance. We took it to the end of the game. I love you.  <br/>Chris, you definitely screwed me over and you definitely  hurt my feelings, but ultimately, I like you better. I just wish I was the  one sitting there next to you. I hope you win.  <br/>(whispering): Twila, the fact that it comes down to the  very end and in your answers, you didn't give any crap answers. You really  said it from your heart. You only said the things that you meant.  <br/>Probst: Okay. For the last time, I'll go get the votes.  Well, I know it's been a long 39 days and a long, respectful, but certainly  emotional final Tribal Council. I would love to read these tonight, but it's  not gonna happen. Going to have to wait till we get back to the U.S. I'll see  you there.  <br/>Probst: This is where I get off. (applause and cheering)  (cheering)  <br/>Probst: All right, let's do it. (cheering and applause)  (applause continues)  <br/>Probst: I know you guys are ready to get to this. Nothing  left to be said. Certainly put through the wringer at the final Tribal, but  fair to say you both had it coming, right?  <br/>Right.  <br/>Probst: All right. Let's get to the vote. Tonight you want  to see your name on that parchment. Tonight the jury voted for a winner.  There are seven votes. You need four to win. I'll read the votes. First  vote... Chris. (applause and cheering) Chris. Two votes Chris. (applause)  Twila. (applause and cheering) Two votes Chris, one vote Twila. Twila. We're  tied. Two votes Chris, two votes Twila. Chris. Three votes Chris, two votes  Twila. The winner of Survivor: Vanuatu, Chris. (applause and cheering)  <br/>Yeah! (whooping and laughing)  <br/>Hi, Chris! Oh, my God...  <br/>Hey... (applause and cheering)  <br/>(all chanting): Chris! Chris! Chris!  <br/>Yeah! Yeah!  <br/>Probst: Well, he's certainly one of the most unlikely  Survivor winners ever. Chris came back from a lousy performance at the first  challenge, infiltrated the women's alliance, and ultimately beat the women at  their own game. It was an emotional final tribal
