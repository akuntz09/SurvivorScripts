<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor," at the old gen x  tribe, it was Chris, Bret and Sunday. <br/>I don't trust him as far  as I can throw him. <br/>Jeff: Against David, Ken and Jessica. <br/>Sunday, Chris and Bret don't trust you. <br/>Jeff: But after the merge, the gen xers put their  differences aside. <br/>The upper echelon of the millennials need to be broKen up. <br/>Jeff: Forming a majority alliance with Hannah, Zeke and Adam. <br/>Michelle is the person to go after. <br/>Jeff: But Adam and Taylor began sharing secrets. <br/>I can steal someone's  reward. Do not tell anyone. <br/>Jeff: And the alliance started to question Adam's loyalty. <br/>You don't think Adam would flip on us, do you? <br/>Adam couldn't just play with the weirdoes. He had to sit at the cool kids' table. <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, the majority decided to trust Adam. Michelle, the tribe has spoKen. Heaving Taylor, Jay and will out of the loop. 12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>I just lost one of my  most trustworthy and loyal people, and now I guess the big gen x cesspool  over there is gunning for the millennials. <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>And even the millennial flippers don't even know because  they're so stupid, like Zeke and Adam and Hannah. Oh, yeah, you three are really going to match up to the other  six that are coming for you. Freaking idiots. <br/>I was happy to see the  votes come down the way they did, because that means I’m gaining some  traction and some control in this majority group. I feel comfortable enough with the solid people in our group,  but people like Adam who were maybe floating in between and really host on  where they needed to go, it just scares me. I don't like it. <br/>How you doing? Stick around. <br/>How the hell did that happen? <br/>You know, you only have so many people you can trust in  this game, and when they're gone, it sucks, bro. <br/>But they trusted Adam. <br/>Me and Jay have to work our way somehow into the alliance  that was solid tonight. So how many are there left? <br/>Of us, three. <br/>I have to pulled a dam  aside and make sure we're still on good terms as far as legal warfare,  because Adam could possibly spill the beans that I buried two things of food. I know tonight didn't work out how we wanted it to. <br/>I understand that you  decided that working with me wasn't in your best interest, and that's totally  fine. Going into tribal council, Jay and Taylor blew up my spot, and  then they gunned fur me, and when they gunned for me, all bets were off. Even if I am at the bottom of gen x, it certainly feels better  than being out of the game, which is where you tried to put me. <br/>As far as like me knowing that you have an advantage in  the game, that's still... Like I respect that, as long as you respect me. <br/>And I have a secret of your, as well, andly keep that, as  well. <br/>Yeah, okay. Rock on, dude. <br/>I feel like I hold a  bigger secret of Adam's than he holds of mine. <br/>Good night, dude. <br/>And I’m going, you rat me out about my food stash, then,  you know, I’m going to rat you out about you advantage in the game. <br/>This is my best idea ever, stealing food. I'm so sneaky that I stole like half of the food. Oh, yeah. And no one even noticed. My pretzels are getting a little bit soggy from all the fruit in  there, so I’m trying to eat the pretzels first. This looks like a date maybe. That's a peach. I still have a whole other mason jar. I'm not even half-way with this one. The only person that knows is Adam, but I have more leverage on  him than he has on me, so this wow, out -- this works out great. <br/>Right there. <br/>The shade? <br/>Yeah. <br/>All right. Sounds good. <br/>Last night I got blind sided. So now in my head it's like, dude, Jay, you might be next, dude. So try to find you way out of this hole, because even though I have  an immunity idol in my back pocket, I’m in trouble. <br/>There was a lot of feeling of these people want to take me  somewhere and not play with me. I felt like the way I have been playing in my relationship with  you guys would have turned me into a pretty decent goat, and that's not what  I wanted to be. I wasn't sure how you feel about it, so I decided to play  independently last night. <br/>I was schooled. I'm proud of you. You did good. <br/>I've taken my game into my own hand, and I want to do it  well. I want to do it justice. I've loved the show since I was 14. I'm coming out here and I’m playing with the intention of trying  the win and it's so fun. <br/>Damn, homie didn't tell me. <br/>I know, but I couldn't  stick with you this time. <br/>Well, include me on the next one, please. <br/>Yeah. I'm finally getting to play. And last night I realized that I could do it. And it's addicting. Like I want to be able to pull off another vote. And now I finally get the chance to make some moves. <br/>High-five. I don't want a he five. High-five. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. All right. You guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: For today's challenge, you'll be divided into two  teams of six. On my go, you'll race through a series of obstacles, attempting  to retrieve a key. You'll use the key to unlock a box. You'll then drag the box underneath a net to the finish. You'll open the box, retrieve the bolos inside attempting to  land them on the target. First team the land their bolos wins reward. The winning team will be taken to a resort where you will lounge  poolside while dining on cheeseburgers, fries and cocktails. <br/>Oh, cheeseburgers. <br/>Fries. <br/>Now we're talking. <br/>Jeff: And soft drinks. So make it more interesting, we'll this a schoolyard pick. We'll pick for captains. And then who do you choose? Members of your alliance or the people who will help you win  food. We'll draw for captains. Let's do it. All right. So we randomly chose for captains. Chris was a captain and picked Bret, Ken, David, Sunday and Taylor. Hannah was a captain. She chose Adam, will, Zeke and Jay and Jessica. Let's see who made the better choice. Here we go. For reward, Survivors ready? Go! Over and under. Ken takes a big fall, but it doesn't slow him down. Once you get everybody to the mat, you can start working on that  key. <br/>Go, go, go, go. <br/>Jeff: Go, purple. Go, orange. David being hoisted up. And demand is going up. <br/>Come on, orange. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Jeff: David working quickly for purple. He's got it. Unlock that box. Adam needs to get those knots undone. He can feel the pressure. <br/>Come on. <br/>Jeff: A quick early lead for purple. They have the box unlocked. Let's go, under the net now. Orange still working on those knots afghanistan. Gigantic setback early into this challenge. Now we've got it. Unlock the box. This is going to be the toughest part. <br/>Come on. Push, guys! <br/>Jeff: You have four bodies and a heavy, big becomes you  have to get under it. Orange has their box unlocked. Let's go, orange. You have to catch up. <br/>Move the dirt, move the dirt. <br/>Jeff: Which foursome can get through here the quickest? You will give a big leaded to bolo throwers. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: Great teamwork by purple. <br/>You watch the net. Pull. <br/>Jeff: Orange making very little progress. <br/>They're having a hard time pushing it through the thing. Clearly Chris made the better choice with tribe members. Purple out of the net. <br/>Do it. <br/>Jeff: All right. Three people on the mat. One person using the machete. It's going to be Ken now chopping the rope. That will release the blocks. <br/>There you go, buddy. <br/>Jeff: Orange still in the netting. <br/>Guys, do a one, two, three, pull. <br/>One, two, three...  We're almost there. <br/>Jeff: Ken is through two. Ken is through all three. Pull the ropes out. <br/>Pull the ropes out. <br/>Jeff: Now Taylor and Sunday taking over. <br/>Come on, guys. They have five bolos. Now you have to hit the target. This is a massive blowout right now. Orange is nowhere close to being through. Taylor going to give it a go. Taylor hooks the first bolo. <br/>Keep going, Taylor. <br/>Taylor, keep going, bud. <br/>Jeff: Taylor hooks the second bolo. <br/>Guys, don't give up. <br/>Jeff: Taylor with three bolos. They are two away. It would be first blowout this season. There's four. Will, Adam and Jay continue to fight to get back in this. Is it too little too late? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Taylor hooks it. Reward for Chris, Ken, Bret, David, Sunday and Taylor! Drinks, food, poolside. What a blowout. Chris, clearly you chose wisely. Nice job. Huge reward. You'll be taken to a beautiful resort. Cheeseburgers, fries, cocktails. Grab your stuff, head out, enjoy the afternoon. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Good job, guys. That was a tough one. <br/>Jeff: All right. Adam, Zeke, Jay, Hannah, will, Jessica, got nothing for you. Grab you stuff, head back to camp. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>I was on such a high for  pulling off my first blindside vote, and I knew I wanted to keep Jay and will  closer to me, because I know they feel on the bottom, but I picked a horrible  team, and the make such a glaring mistake, it takes you back a step, but if I  want to stay in the game, I have the prove that I can handle this. <br/>Oh. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>This is beautiful. <br/>Oh, guys, look at this spread. <br/>Are you kidding me right now? <br/>Drinks. Oranges. <br/>ChicKen, diewsmed. <br/>We walk in and my senses were just overloaded. The amount of food packed on that table, it was crazy. <br/>Burger. Luckily my body has been a little bit more adapted to food than  these other guys because I've been sneaking food, so I’m a lot more capable  of drinking more, eating more. That's an advantage. I could win next challenge from that. <br/>Guys, some cocktails are coming. <br/>Here he comes. <br/>Going into the reward, I said, there are going to be  drinks, take it a little easy, don't go crazy. Yes, sir, right here. But come on now, there's a pool looking out at the ocean,  there's food. At least my belly been full, so I can have more drinks. Keep these coming until I drop, will you? So I just went all out. I was like, I’m going to drink as much as I can while I’m here. This is ridiculous. If you climb that bean stock, you're looking at this face right  here. <br/>My man Bret started knocking back the drinks. He was all in, man. He had probably, I don't know, eight or nine drinks. <br/>Cannonball. <br/>He was letting loose, but that's just Bret. He's a big, loud guy. <br/>If I run out to the ocean and get fresh fish, can you mix  it into a drink? <br/>It's kind of an odd group that we have going on here. I mean, for a solid alliance, we've got Chris, Bret, myself, but  we don't 100% trust David, Ken or Jessica. <br/>Good as new Sunday,? <br/>Good as new. We're just fractured as gen xers because of the experience at  the gen x tribe, so moving forward what I want to make is a proactive move,  because I definitely feel like I need to take control of the game. <br/>That was a gritty challenge for sure. <br/>Dude, that was hell. <br/>Right now I’m on a losing streak, Michelle goes home from  tribal council, I just lost reward. I try to regroup myself, and I’m thinking, the gen xers are  gone. I'll talk the Adam. Maybe we can make something happen. I know you have numbers obviously, because I got blind sided. I knew they was screwed, that I got caught, and that it was  going to be my name was going the come up. And so at that point, I would have written your name down. It was either be at the bottom of gen x, as you like the call  it, or go home. So there was no choice. <br/>I’m worried that I might  be playing too aggressively, that I might be playing too hard, but I have to  prove my loyalty to my alliance, because I have a much stronger bond with gen  x than I certainly ever will with Jay at this point. <br/>Taylor is the reason that you and will and Taylor are all  on the bottom and that Michelle is out of the game, because, you know,  he...  So I am on the bottom? <br/>Of course. You know from the vote last night you're on the bottom. <br/>I talked to Adam, and Adam  was just a huge jerk. He's basically like throwing it in my face that I’m on the wrong  side of the line and basically saying, how does it feel to be on the bottom, Jay. So what is it, the gen xers are all together again? <br/>The people who voted last night clearly made some kind of,  you know, you heard Chris, he said, tonight a line will be drawn. <br/>So my back is up against the wall. There's going to be immunity tomorrow. Hopefully it's a challenge I could win, because if not, I’m in  trouble, because it looks like they're gunning my way. <br/>Adam basically just rubbed it in my face that I’m on the  bottom. <br/>What did he actually say to you? <br/>That we're on the bottom and we're next in line and that's  it. <br/>Why would Adam say that to you? <br/>Because he's an [bleeped]  Yeah, pretty much. <br/>So you don't like working with him? <br/>I wanted to vote Adam out  yesterday just to get Adam out of the game so I didn't have to work with him. <br/>I can confirm that he  said this. <br/>Adam can't be smart like the rest of us are. <br/>Andy: Trying to bring will and Jay back into the fold, Adam  has to gloat and make Jay feel crappy. I'm just like, Adam, don't be an idiot and make people feel like  they're on the bottom because that's when they vote against you. <br/>Here it comes. <br/>Oh, wow. <br/>Isn't that nice? <br/>That looks cool. <br/>14 days left. <br/>It's a crazy game. <br/>You all right? <br/>Uh-huh. I'm in the position right now where Jessica and I are friendly  hellos, but something is underlying there. <br/>I don't trust her. <br/>Why is -- why does she hate you? <br/>Because I put her name down. <br/>So did I? <br/>She's nice. We connect as moms, but I just think because I voted for her,  she's really going the want to get me out. <br/>Hello, Sunday. <br/>Hello. <br/>We're just like, it's nice knowing you boys. Which one of us is going home now? <br/>One of us is going to get each other first. I can definitely use Jay. Right now he's feeling like he's at the bottom. We have a really good relationship from our time at ika bula. I just need to talk to Jay. <br/>Who would be your pick? I just want to see where you're at? <br/>I'll write whatever name, Sunday. I told you, I’m with you. I trust you wholly. <br/>I do you, too, I really  do. I'll push for jess today and I’m sure it will be an easy... I just  feel like she's going to be after me. <br/>That's what I did with Michaela. <br/>I'll write jess tonight unless five minutes before you  guys are like, write this. <br/>You and Taylor and will. <br/>As soon as Sunday says Jessica, I’m like, sweet. Say anyone's name but me and tails and will. I have to stay positive and give good energy and the universe  should be all right with giving it back. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>What is this? All right. You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: First things first, will. Take it back. Thank you. Once again immoneyty is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're going the stand on a narrow beam while  balancing a ball on a wooden bow. At regular intervals you will move further down the beam, making  it more difficult. If at any point your ball drops or you fall off the beam, you're  out of the challenge. Last person left standing wins immunity, safe from the vote,  losers go to tribal council where somebody will be the ninth person voted out  of this game, the second member of our jury. There are moments in every season of "Survivor" that  even without immunity you feel pretty safe. If that is you today, I have an opportunity. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>Here we go. <br/>Jeff: You can opt to sit out of the challenge, give up  your shot at immunity, and eat, grilled ham and cheese sandwiches, salty  potato chips, ice cold beer, and soft drinks. Let's do it. All right. Zeke and will are sitting out. The only two people who feel safe enough to have no shot at  immunity. You can start eating. Let's get this challenge on. Everybody take your spot. I'm going to count you in. <br/>I opted to eat because I knew  I wasn't going to win that challenge against surfer guys. They're obviously going to beat me, so I could lose and go back  the camp with nothing, or I could eat and go back the camp with a full belly. <br/>Jeff: Five, four, three, two, one... This challenge is on. It's not easy to balance that ball on that bow while on a narrow  beam. We will go five minutes in this round, and then we'll move to  the next section. Hannah in trouble but a nice save by Hannah. Hannah first out. Will join will and Zeke, but will not be able to eat or steal a  chip or citizenship of beer or a soft drink. Will, you know you can't drink beer, right? <br/>Yeah, I know. <br/>Jeff: We're down the nine. Very clear from the choices made that this game is absolutely up  in the air. Will and Zeke have perceived certainty. The rest of you are fighting for actual certainty. I'm going to count you down. When I get to zero, you're safe. Five, four, three, two, one. You are safe. We're going the move down now to the next section. You must have one foot now in the second section of beam. It's a little more narrow. Going to be more difficult. Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one... This challenge is back on. Sunday in trouble quickly but a nice save. Great recovery. That wind can come up out of nowhere. Bret's ball on the move now but quickly recovers. On the move again. Couldn't recover. Bret is out of the challenge. We are down to eight. Chris with some movement now and a nice save. <br/>Why didn't I opt out? <br/>Why didn't I opt out? <br/>Jeff: All right. We have five, four, three, two, one. This round is over. For this next section, you will now have one foot in the most  narrow part of the beam. This will be the trickiest part of the challenge. We will stay here for 20 minutes. Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one. We're back on the third and final section. Immediately Jessica's out. Sunday's out. David's out. Three drop. Chris is out. We are quickly down to four. It is Jay, Adam, Taylor and Ken fighting for immunity that  clearly everybody except for will and Zeke thinks they need. Adam in trouble. Jay now in trouble and a nice save. Adam is out. We are down to three. You can't do it. Jay is out and we are now down to two. It is Taylor and Ken, fittingly side by side. Taylor with a lot of movement and whistling. A little movement by Taylor but a nice recovery. Ken with a little movement. <br/>Ken's going down. Kenny. <br/>Jeff: Taylor is out. Ken wins individual immunity, safe at tribal council. <br/>Nice work, guys. Nice work. Ken, come on over. <br/>Yeah, Kenny. <br/>Jeff: Nice job. Immunity is yours. Ken is safe tonight at tribal council. Cannot be voted out of this game. As for the rest of you, after 25 days out here, somebody will be  the ninth person voted out, the second member of the jury. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal council. <br/>Leaving the challenge all I’m thinking to myself is it's  either going to be me or tails tonight, but Sunday told me Jessica, so my  life is basically in Sunday's hands at the moment. <br/>Great job, Ken. <br/>Nice job. <br/>Sit in the hammock. <br/>The immunity challenge came down to battle between Ken and  Taylor, but in the end Ken pulled out a win. <br/>Boy, it's hot. <br/>I’m down for a swim. <br/>Me, too. <br/>Now we have our choice between whether to vote out Jay or Taylor. Will is safe because he's seen as less of a threat. <br/>We need firewood. <br/>But an idol could come into play tonight. Whoever Taylor and Jay want to go home goes home. <br/>I'll get some firewood. <br/>So the safest bet is to split the votes. <br/>So what's our best move, guys, splitting them? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Are we comfortable with that? Let's get Sunday over here. <br/>There's evan and jess. Should we include them? <br/>What do you think, jess? <br/>We're scared of an idol. I like the split. <br/>I like that. <br/>In this particular instance, we think it's the safest bet  to split the votes between Taylor and Jay. Jay is the biggest schemer, the biggest plotter. Taylor is the least trustworthy of the two. <br/>You vote Jay? <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>We're good. <br/>Because we're splitting the votes, I feel very confident  that one of them is going to go home. <br/>What's up? <br/>I don't like it, but I'll  go with it. I don't want the write Jay down. <br/>If it were up to me, I would 100% like the see Jessica go  home. I'm worried about Jessica. But because of the way the numbers are, I don't think there's  any way that I would be making the move. <br/>Eel talk to Bret. Let's go get Bret. <br/>It's a bummer because I wanted to use Jay to make a move  against Jessica. <br/>Ouch. <br/>The majority wants you or Taylor. We can't do anything about it. <br/>That's okay. I got to do what I got to do. <br/>This sucks. Everything that we planned is out the window. And I hate being on the fricKen bottom, man. <br/>There you go. <br/>Hey, you know...  Yeah. <br/>Tonight it's either me or Taylor, but I’m still in the  ring, still throwing punches. I'm not going to give up. <br/>We have to walk down to the raft. <br/>You have a bunker full of food. <br/>No, you don't. <br/>Yeah, I do. <br/>I know that it's either  me or you tonight. <br/>So let's have our feast together. <br/>My closest friend out here is tails, but I’m not going to  tell Taylor I have an idol. <br/>You got to be kidding me, dude. <br/>No, I’m not. <br/>The bunker of food, my friend. <br/>I love you. <br/>I got three options with  my immunity idol. Plan "A," put it on my neck, be like, yo, forget your  plan, I’m never going anywhere. <br/>This is the last meal. <br/>Option b, put it on tails neck, but if they're splitting  the vote, that crowd backfire and next thing you know, I’m gone. <br/>I got a good feeling it's  me, bro. <br/>Cheers, dude. <br/>Or option c, just be quiet about it, hope for the best,  and just save it for a rainy day. <br/>I don't know if this is  smart. It could bite me in the ass. <br/>One of us is going. <br/>Adam has an advantage in the game. <br/>Oh, yeah? <br/>Yeah. And this is what it is: It's that he can steal someone's reward. <br/>Wow. <br/>Is a loved one visit, he can switch it all up, no matter  who wins. But here's the thing, Adam knows about my food bunker, and in  exchange, he wouldn't tell anyone about my bunker for me not telling anyone  about his advantage. <br/>Advantage? <br/>Advantage in the game. If I state that Adam has an advantage in this game, that's going  to put massive target on his back. <br/>Dude, that will ruin his game. He voted out Figgy. <br/>Yeah. In my mind, I’m still holding a lot of animosity toward Adam. <br/>Do it, dude. <br/>I am an avenger of Figgy  at this point. <br/>Crazy day today. <br/>Oh, I know. Oh, I know. <br/>If you steal the loved one's visit, those people hate you,  and I think that that's a lot more leverage against him than he has on me. People already know I steal food, who cares? Figs told me the fight as hard as I could, get to the end of  this, and so that's what I’m trying to do. This, and so that's what I’m trying to do. <br/>Jeff: We'll no bring in the first member of our jury. Michelle voted out at the last tribal council. Jay, what happened when you got back the camp after last tribal? <br/>Oh, man, Jeff, as a fan, I wish I was on that side, but  being a player on the wrong side, hopefully I get some new info or somebody  throws me a bone, because it felt pretty crappy being on the wrong side  honestly. <br/>Welcome to the club. Jay is not the first person in this game to be blindsided. It's happened to me. It's happened to a lot of people that are sitting here. <br/>Well, obviously. That's the game "Survivor."  Jeff: So, Jay, you and Adam clearly are not voting  together tonight. <br/>I'd love to write his name down again. Honestly, Jeff, I'll be real with it. <br/>Jeff: Do you, Taylor and will, feel like you're in trouble  tonight because of last tribal? <br/>Oh, for sure, Jeff. <br/>All three of us, we were on the wrong side. Oh, man, my clock is ticking. <br/>Jeff: Chris, could you feel that Taylor and will and Jay  believed they were on the wrong side of that line that had been drawn? <br/>Sure, I think they felt that the first night, but I've  been on the wrong side of the line, and you just work yourself back in, so  play the game, get back in there. There's cracks. <br/>Jeff: Interesting. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Okay. Here we go. I'm going to do something. So when I got caught eating banana chips, I wasn't trying to be  sneaky, but I did hide two jars full, packed full of food and buried them,  and Adam helped me do it. <br/>They had three jars buried in the sand. <br/>Let me clear the air, if I may. I did not help Taylor bury anything. <br/>You ate the food. <br/>I did not eat any of that  food and you know that's a lie. I watched you dig the hole. <br/>That's what you're upset about. <br/>Yeah, because you're defaming my character. <br/>I watched him. I did not help him and I never ate that food, not once. <br/>Why is Adam so upset about it? <br/>Because you're lying that I helped you do it. <br/>All I did was keep your secret, Taylor. <br/>What specific food was in the jars? <br/>I smashed as much stuff  in there as I could? <br/>Where are they now? <br/>It's gone. <br/>You ate it? <br/>Me and Jay ate it today because we thought you were voting  us out. <br/>Today? <br/>Yep, but if you guys want to gun for me and Jay, the  bigger threat is over there, because he told me a little secret. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Adam has an advantage in this game. <br/>What? <br/>That is the truth. <br/>I have an advantage. <br/>There really is an advantage? <br/>Adam, what's the advantage? <br/>My advantage is that at any point if I lose a reward, I can  play the advantage as if I had won the reward. <br/>So in other words he can steal your loved one's visit. <br/>Not necessarily. <br/>That means someone is going to get their loved one ripped  from their hands even though you won. <br/>But it's an advantage that doesn't impact the game. It's a reward...  It does impact the game, man. <br/>It's a reward. It's not about... In here and in here, that impacts the game,  bro. <br/>How did they know about the advantage? <br/>I told Taylor. Clearly I made a mistake in who I could trust. But I did not bury any food or eat any food that was buried. And I thought it was wrong from the start. And if the advantage that I got is so terrible, then vote me  out. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: David, that was with the equivalent of a "Survivor"  bombing with dropped. <br/>Huge bomb. I'm stunned. I'm uncomfortable and I’m stunned. I do feel admitting what you did is the nail in the coffin for  one of you. <br/>No other choice. <br/>The reason he had no other choice is because he knew as  soon as he revealed my secret I was of course going to reveal his. If I know I can get ahead by eating more food than these guys, I’m  going to do it. <br/>Jeff: Jessica, do you think what Taylor is expressing is  millennial, that idea that you just, well, yeah, I did it. Here's why. It's all good. <br/>I think Taylor is looking  for a pat on the back, like it's okay, you told us, you came clean. <br/>Jeff: Here a trophy. <br/>You are abas absolutely correct. That's not how I was raised. I'm sure that's not the way Chris or Ken or Bret or anyone  else...  Why did you skip me? I didn't hide those jars. I'm in the like that. So that's not cool with me. So I was pissed at Adam and tails. Tails is one of my homies from home, get drunk, have fun, go  with the flow, me on the other hand, I have dreams and goals. I'm not just a regular dumb surfer. I'm trying the further my life, no offense, dude. No offense. But when I found out from Taylor today that him and Adam buried  it, if I was in Adam's position, I would have been like, this isn't right,  dude, this isn't morally right. <br/>Adam, he's bringing up a strong point, which is not saying  something can often be seen as just as bad. <br/>First of all this, is coming from the guy who already  admitted eating this food. <br/>Crumbs. <br/>There were only crumbs. But you ate it. <br/>But he said you did, and just because this is the game of  "Survivor," I’m not going to drop my morals when everyone is  starving. <br/>You ate the food. I did not. What are you talking about? <br/>Jeff: Jay, you're accusing Adam of not saying anything,  but you have to own the other half, which is you're admitting that I did eat  some of it? <br/>I’m going to admit. I had some food, yes. <br/>He just said he would not take food from starving people  and admitted to eating it, which I did not do. <br/>So you say. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Hannah, where are we for the vote tonight? Because on one hand nobody is going to disagree with voting out Adam  because he has an advantage. On the other hand, you have Taylor and Jay, who both admitted  now to eating food. <br/>The game is always more complicated than a simple  disagreement. It's about who you can trust. It's about looking at future votes and future partnerships. I mean, there might be an idol in play. There are idols in play. It complicates everything. "Survivor" is not a simple game. <br/>Jeff: Bret, what's your take? <br/>I think what we have here  is several different errors here, and I think what we need to know is who is  the most culpable. <br/>Jeff: All right. It's time to vote. Adam, you're up. Adam, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want the play it,  now would be the time to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked the leave the tribal council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote Jay. Taylor. Adam. One vote Jay, one vote Taylor, one vote Adam. Jay. Two votes Jay. <br/>Surprise, surprise. <br/>Jeff: Taylor. Two votes Taylor. Jay. That's three votes Jay. Taylor. We're tied, three votes Taylor, three votes Jay, one vote Adam. Jay. That's four votes Jay. Taylor. Tied again. Four votes Taylor, four votes Jay, one vote Adam. Taylor. Five votes Taylor, four votes Jay. Ninth person voted out and the second member of our jury, Taylor. That's six. That's enough. You need to wring me your torch. Taylor, the tribe has spoKen. Time for you to go. <br/>Good luck, guys. Sorry for stealing food. Well, almost every single vote at tribal council is about  strategy. Every so often it's just about consequences. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor"...  Three of us vote out Chris. <br/>Jeff: The gen xers are imploding. <br/>It's a gen x civil war. <br/>Jeff: And will puts his trust in Zeke. <br/>Jay does have an idol. <br/>I don't want to tell too  many people. <br/>Jay does have an idol. <br/>That's good to know. <br/>Jay does have an idol. <br/>Did you hear what will told Zeke? <br/>My "Survivor" adventure has been quite epic. I came out here running through the night and sneaking food. I lived through a hurricane, made a new great friend, his name  is Jay. I got a girlfriend, and hopefully we're going to buy a sailboat  and go have some adventures together, so I’m pretty stoked about that.
