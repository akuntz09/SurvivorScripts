<br/>Jeff: Previously on "Survivor": At the last  tribal council, there was a rock draw. Reveal. <br/>Jessica was sent to the jury. And willed her legacy advantage to Ken. Nine are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Tonight was just very emotional. To have people pick a rock rather than vote me out of this game  and then to have Jessica pick the black rock, it's an awful feeling. I feel guilty and I feel thankful, and I-- I just feel awful. I just watched someone-- everything get ripped because of a  rock. <br/>Don't put this all on yourself. <br/>We all took the gamble. <br/>We all made a choice. I'm really angry at myself. I burned my idol at tribal for no reason. And now, I find myself in a minority with Hannah, Ken, and Adam. So I need to find some crack somewhere. Otherwise, the five is just going to pick us off one by one. , starting with me. <br/>Bro, I told you, I told you. <br/>The tribal council was amazing! I loved it. I loved it. Man, I felt like a warrior. <br/>That pissed me off, too. <br/>This vote was all about David and I going to war together. And I definitely won upon battle. <br/>I’m trying very hard not  to be too excited, but I feel like I’m going to the final five. <br/>Oh, yeah. I think I can win this game. And I’m just as happy I could win this game as I am that David  is going to lose it. <br/>I received a gift this  morning, in my bag. I got this. "Congratulations. You have found the legacy advantage. If you are in possession of some note on day 36, you will  receive an advantage in the game." jess, you are amazing. Jess told me that she'd give me advantage if she got voted out. God, I love that girl. And she did. It's big. There is something to be said about the power of being authentic  and genuine relationships in this game. Day 36 if I’m still here I’m going to open this up and see what  it brings me because I feel like I've got a really good shot to get my  daughter and I a new life and a better life and maybe walking away with a  million dollars. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! <br/>Jeff: All right, so we are 31 days into this game. I think it sounds like a perfect time unde for love. <br/>No way! Dude. <br/>Jeff: Sunday, say hello to your husband, Jeff! <br/>What! <br/>Jeff: Jeff, come on out! <br/>No way! Oh, my God! I can't believe you're here! <br/>Jeff: Take it in, Sunday. What does that feel like? <br/>Like, you're with people all the time but you're, like,  alone. Then to see someone that makes you not alone. <br/>Jeff: All right, give her a hug. Take a spot. <br/>Oh! [ applause ]  Jeff: Bret, you ready for some love? <br/>Yup. <br/>Jeff: Here comes your dad, don. Don, come on out! <br/>Oh, boy. <br/>Try not to trip. Look at you! You're looking great! It's good to see you. <br/>I told him I wouldn't  cry. <br/>Look at you. <br/>I know. This guy is the best guy in the world. A great friend. <br/>There it is. <br/>To see him here, he'll do anything for me. <br/>I’m so proud of you. <br/>Thanks, dad. I'm going to-- I can't believe I’m crying. I told you guys I wouldn't cry. <br/>You loser! You loser! Loser! <br/>Jeff: All right, take your spot back. <br/>Good to see you, dad. <br/>Jeff: Jay, say hello to your sister melanie. Come on out, melanie. <br/>Oh, my God. What did they do to you. <br/>I know. <br/>Jeff: Jay, you can't let go of her. You keep grak her back in close. <br/>I have two half to my  heart, Jeff, and one is standing here, and one is at home because my mom  can't come. So that's my fuel. That's my heart, Jeff. That's my heart. I'll give me up before I give her up. <br/>Jeff: Melanie, that's pretty powerful. Not every brother-sister has this relationship. <br/>He just happens to know we love him back home and he's not  alone, not even on this island. We're on there for him. <br/>Jeff: All right, melanie, give him a last hug. <br/>I love you. <br/>Jeff: Hannah, you ready for some love. <br/>My mom, I’m going to see my mom. <br/>Jeff: Mom, come on out. Here comes liz! [ applause ]  I’m okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. <br/>Jeff: Wow, you're now comforting your mom. <br/>Jeff: Wait a minute, this is backwards. <br/>I’m good. <br/>Jeff: Tell me what's going on, because this is a pretty  unique situation in that the daughter started comforting the mom. <br/>My mom is my hero. She's the bravest person I know. She's-- she beat cancer, so, like, the strength is this woman. <br/>Jeff: All right, give her one last hug. <br/>I’m good, I’m good, I’m good. <br/>Bye. <br/>Jeff: Adam, you ready for some rof? <br/>Yeah. You have no idea, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Evan, come on out. Here comes Adam's brother, evan. <br/>Hi! <br/>My mom has stage four lung cancer, and I don't know what's  going on with my mom. I don't know what's going on at home. I don't know what's going on at home. <br/>Jeff: Adam, does it strike you how fast the game can fall  away and all you're doing right now is feeling love of someone you know you  can trust? <br/>Yeah. I mean, I needed to be here right now. I needed my brother to come out today. And if I didn't get that, it would have been absolutely devastating. I-- I want you guys all to know, and evan -- they already know  this-- but I actually have an advantage in this game. That allows me to steal a reward. But I can't use it. Okay? <br/>You're going to win it anyway. <br/>Because I can't-- I can't take you guys away from your  loved ones. I can't do it. You know. <br/>You're a good dude, bro. <br/>, are. Thank you, Adam. <br/>Jeff: Give him a hug. Lawyer. <br/>I will. <br/>Jeff: David, are you ready for some love? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Let's get your dad out here. <br/>Doug, come on out! <br/>Dad! <br/>I've missed you so much. <br/>I've missed you so much. I swear I've been crying so much out here. <br/>Jeff: David, why is it important for you to have your dad  see you out here in one of the toughest situations anyone will ever find themselves? N? <br/>I just-- I want to make  him proud? <br/>Oh, you already have. <br/>Thank you. And he has such a joy for life, a passion for life. And he lives a fearless life, and I came into this game as this  fearful, neurotic oddball, and when I walk out, I want to walk out as the man  my father is. He's my hero. And I love you. <br/>I love you, too. I missed you. <br/>Thanks for coming out, man. <br/>Jeff: Ken, let's get your brother out here. William, come on out! <br/>Brother! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Ken, you can describe that feeling of security you  get when you put your arm around blood, somebody you know in this moment will  not betray you? <br/>I always have since  second grade. I it was what would you want to be when you grow up? It was him in his football union form. My role model, father figure, and now best friend all rolled  into one. He's my rock. <br/>Jeff: All right, last love. Zeke, let's get your dad out here. Sam, come on out! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Papa! <br/>Hey, buddy! Good to see you. <br/>I’m so glad to see you. <br/>It's wonderful! <br/>I love you, buddy. <br/>I love you, too. <br/>You're look great. You're looking strong. <br/>Jeff: Tell me about this relationship, dad? <br/>Well, this is my hero. This is the strong person here. This is who I look up to and who I model my behavior after. <br/>Jeff: Wow. Zeke, that has got to feel great to have your dad say that. <br/>Yeah, I mean-- oh, God, I said I wasn't going to cry. You know, my dad and I-- you know, we've not always been super  close. And, you know, it's been in the past couple of years that we've  really made an effort to get to know one another, and this adventure is  about, like, becoming the person I want to be for the rest of my life. And it's about forging this relationship that we're going to  have for the rest of our lives. <br/>Jeff: Hugs. <br/>Strong like a bull. [ applause ] I’m with you. <br/>Jeff: Will, let's get your mom out here. Irene, come on out! [ applause ]  Oh, my God. <br/>You are so amazing. God is good. I remember when you were little, and I said I'd go anywhere for  your smile, even timbuktu. And here I am in timbuktu. <br/>I love you, mom. [ applause ]  Jeff: All right, so, we know the stakes. The stakes are love. Let's get to the challenge. For today's challenge, you're going to be attached to a rope  that is woven through a series of obstacles. On my "Go," you are anything to race through those  obstacles to the end toward love. First to finish wins. Want to know what you're playing for. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: First person to finish will take their loved one  back to camp with them. And instead of treating them to your normal day of rice and  maybe a couple of fish, we're going to do a good-old american barbecue. <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>Jeff: I know it's worth playing for. We're gog draw for spots. We'll get started. You're going to watch. Here we go, for reward in the form of love. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Go, Adam. <br/>Get them, Bret! <br/>Jeff: You have to launch yourself over these obstacles  while threading that rope, giving yourself slack when you need it, but making  sure you don't get tangled up in the slack. <br/>Ow! Ow! <br/>Jeff: Adam all tied up. Sunday having a lot of trouble. Will having a lot of trouble. There's Ken in the lead. Jay right behind. <br/>You got it! You can do it! <br/>Go! <br/>Jeff: Wow, Jay launches himself. Here comes Zeke! He's trying to get in this now. <br/>Go, Zeke! <br/>Jeff: Here comes Hannah out of nowhere. <br/>Come on, Hannah! You can do it. <br/>Jeff: Ken and Jay have moved on to the next obstacle. Right behind Hannah is Bret and then Adam. We've got a lot of people in this now. Zeke makes quick time of that second obstacle. Zeke now at the third obstacle. David moving on to the next obstacle. It is still Sunday who cannot figure out this challenge, and  will who is struggling. Adam through want second obstacle, moving on to the third. It is now Ken in the lead. You've got to dig under that beam. David back in it. <br/>Good job! <br/>Aaahh! <br/>Jeff: Ken, stuck underneath that post. He had a big lead. <br/>Push with your feet! <br/>Jeff: Jay trying to catch Ken. Adam is stuck. He's got half his body through. But just like Ken, it's that booty. <br/>You got this, Adam. <br/>Jeff: Jay is through now. Jay in the lead now. <br/>I can't make it. Aaah! <br/>Jeff: Jay is at the final obstacle. <br/>Come on, brother, come on! <br/>Jeff: Zeke is now going to give Jay a run for his money. Can he catch him? <br/>Keep going! <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Jeff: Ken is now in it. <br/>Go, Ken. <br/>Jeff: Here comes Hannah! <br/>Aaah! <br/>Jeff: David is now at the final obstacle. Adam is literally stuck and cannot move. His shot at love is falling away. <br/>No! <br/>Jeff: Can anybody catch Jay for the win? <br/>I’m sorry, evan! <br/>I know you're trying, Adam. <br/>Jeff: It is David, Zeke, Jay, and Ken. Whoa will get to the end first? <br/>You're doing great, buddy. <br/>Jeff: Zeke throwing himself through the ropes. <br/>Come on, buddy! Come on, Zeke! <br/> Jeff: Jay wins reward! <br/>Damn it! <br/>Jeff: In the form of love in a massive challenge. <br/>Thank you! <br/>Congratulations! [ spitting ]  Jeff: Jay, come on over. <br/>Nice work Jay. <br/>Thank you, guys. <br/>Jeff: Melanie, come on over and join Jay. You are anything back to camp, a "Survivor" experience  along way nice barbecue. Pick another Survivor and their loved one to join you. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Okay, I respect each and every one of you as warriors, but  I made a promise in the beginning of the game to take will. So I'll take will. <br/>Jeff: Will, come on over. Mom, come join him. [ applause ]. <br/>Oh, I’m liking it. <br/>Jeff: Jay, pick one more Survivor and their loved one. <br/>For the same reason, they made a promise to me first  before everyone of you. And I have to pick Sunday. <br/>Wow, yay! <br/>Jeff: Sunday, come on over. Jeff, join your woman. <br/>I’m sorry, guys. I truly am. <br/>No, hey--  Forget it. <br/>Jeff: This is looking like a nice gathering for a  barbecue, I think tow even it out, it would be nice to have one more Survivor. <br/>You've got to be kidding me, dude. <br/>Jeff: And one more loved one. <br/>Jay, please. You've got to. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Look at that. Jay, every single person. <br/>All right, all right, I love you guys, man but this guy  didn't do it. And he could have done it. And me and Adam have been brawling this whole damn time, man. You come on, man. <br/>Thank you. <br/>You didn't do it, dude. <br/>Jeff: Adam and your brother. Evan, come on over. <br/>Jeff: All right, guys, everybody's going back to camp  together. The only people who will share in the reward part of this are  you guys. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Enjoy the afternoon. Loved ones I’m sorry. You've got to go. No last hugs. <br/>I love you, man. <br/>I love you, dad, see you  soon. Tell everyone back home I love them, too, and I miss everyone. <br/>Love you. <br/>Jay, thank you. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Adam, I respect you for not playing your advantage. This whole time Adam has had an advantage to take away a reward  but he walked out and there and said, "Listen, I’m not stealing a family  visit because that's not right." for five seconds we saw the soft side  of Adam. Sometimes I hate you, and sometimes I love you. But at this moment, I respect you, and you're a cool dude. <br/>I've been thinking about you guys every single day. <br/>We've been thinking about you, too. <br/>What's going on? <br/>She started having some bad reactions to the chemo pill. Eventually, they decided that the side effects she was having  just weren't worth the potential gain that she might be getting. So we stopped that pill and a couple of weeks later, they said  that the infusion wasn't really doing its job. <br/>So we had her...  She's regaining a lot of strength. <br/>Damn it. <br/>Nothing can really lighten the load back at home. It's a very serious situation, but me and my parents love "Survivor"  as much as Adam does, and having him out here is such a boon for us. It drives me and my parents forward. Especially my mom. She's getting so much strength from knowing that he's out here  living his dream. The most important thing she wanted me to let you know is that  she's getting so much more strength from you. <br/>I know. <br/>She feels you out here. I'm here to bring joy to my family, to make them proud and to  give them as much to look forward to as humanly possible. And the best I do in this game, the longer I last, and the more  that I make my mom happy, I have to stay focused. And I have to use this as inspiration to continue fighting out  here. <br/>So what's up, brother? <br/>We just wanted to say thank you so much. <br/>Hey, man! Don't worry, bro. <br/>Like, you don't know how much-- how important this was. It really, really meant a lot. And I'll never forget it. And I don't know if there's ever going to be a way I can repay  you totally, but I’m giving you the advantage, dude. <br/>Damn, bro. For real? <br/>Yeah. No strings attached. Nothing. I just want you to have it. <br/>Yo, man, thank you. Thank you. <br/>I’m playing for so much  more than a million dollars and the title of "Sole Survivor." the  stakes for me are maybe higher than for anyone who's played this game. <br/>Seeing my mom made me realize that I need to start playing  this game because despite the moves I made, despite the things that I've done  in this game, people still don't give me the credit I deserve. And that can ruin my shot at winning this game. <br/>He does. He absolutely does. And, by the way, I know, like, I’m a target, and everything, but  right now, like, use me for this vote. <br/>Dude, I’m tired of using people. I want to work with people. <br/>Okay, good, yeah, great. <br/>Tonight's the night. It's time to flip the script. The biggest threat out here is Zeke. And if he gets to the end, he will beat any one of us. It is very risky, but I didn't come here to be dragged as a  goat. I came here to play. <br/>All right, I love it. Boom. Will telling me that he wants to swing over to our side, it was  like music to my ears because right now, you know, I’m an endangered species. But I think will's telling the truth. So there's a really good chance that Zeke is going home tonight. Âª âª  Jeff: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Jay, you know what has to happen first. <br/>I know. <br/>Jeff: I'll take it back. Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will each have two handles that you  will use to keep tension on a steel bar. If at any point you release that tension, the bar will drop, the  tile will break, you're out of the challenge. Last person left standing wins immunity. Guaranteed a one-in-eight shot at winning this game. Losers, tribal council. Somebody will become the fifth member of our jury. Draw for spot, we'll get started. All right, everybody grab your handles. Get some tension on that bar. Let's go. Three, two, one. And this challenge is on. There is absolutely no wiggle room in this challenge. The slightest slip, and you're done. It could happen quickly. You start to feel your hands shake a little. David is the first to drop. David's out. Take a spot on the bench, no shot at immunity. We are down to eight. That's how fast it can happen. It looks so easy watching it. Hannah slips, but a nice save. Hannah crops. Hannah's out of the challenge. Will drops out of nowhere. You just let it up for a moment, that tension release, and  that's what happened to Bret. Four people quickly out of this challenge. Strength, concentration, and touch-- that is the key, the right  finesse. Sunday drops. No shot at immunity. And we are down to four. Jay, Ken, Adam, and Zeke. Zeke with a little wobble, but a nice recovery. Zeke struggling to stay in it. Zeke drops. Zeke is out of the challenge. No shot at immunity, and we are down to three. Jay, Ken, and Adam. Fighting for immunity. Jay with his first movement but a nice recovery. This is another challenge. There is no finish line. It's just outlasting the others. Don't let this hot sun start to bake your mind. You have been out here only four minutes. I know it seems like a lot longer. Adam still solid. Ken, the big slip. Jay slips again and another recovery. Ken slips a little more. If you lose your concentration, you will drop. Ken drops and we're down to two. It is Jay and Adam in a showdown of millennials for immunity on  day 33. This is "Survivor" right here. Who wants it more? Jay trying to keep tension on his bar. Adam slips but a nice save. Both guys feeling it. Jay drops. Adam wins individual immunity, will live to say day 34. Adam, come on over. [ applause ]  I’m going to soak this  in, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: Soak it in. <br/>Oh, man. Individual immunity. <br/>Jeff: Individual immunity is yours. You will live to see day 34. Massive accomplishment. As for the rest of you, after 33 days, your quest to win "Survivor"  and the million dollars that goes with it, will come to a crashing halt. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. Congrats. <br/>Thank you, Jeff. <br/>Zeke lost the challenge, so this is my moment. This is my time to make a big move. Of so that people realize that, hey, this 18-year-old kid from  jersey, he's here to play. Âª âª  Congratulations, Adam. <br/>Hell of a win there. You earned it. <br/>Thank you. The immunity challenge was awesome! I'm making my "Survivor" dreams come true. I only have one check box left, and that's winning this game. And, you know, what? It might actually happen because I’m safe at tribal council  tonight. I have a hidden immunity idol in my pocket. And will wants to make a move, and blindside Zeke. <br/>We have a solid five. Just vote Zeke. No matter what anyone says, just vote week. <br/>And we pray that will--  It doesn't work without will. <br/>I no longer have a hidden  immunity idol, so I’m incredibly vulnerable. And it's like will just got his driver's license, and we're all  sitting in the back terrified because this is the first time he's going to  take us for a drive. But I think it's going to work. <br/>Something's up. I have the numbers so I should be feeling great. However, there's something amiss at the Vinaka camp. It does not make sense that the four should be as calm as they  are. If he has an idol, it's marguerite as for me tonight. I know David is coming for me, but h and we need to get rid of  him. David has a nose for idols, and we're so close to the end, I can't  take the risk. So we need to throw somebody else under the bus. <br/>Who? <br/>Ken. <br/>Let's do that, yeah. <br/>Ken. <br/>How you feeling, brother? You got two sides tugging at you, man, and it's tough. <br/>Yeah, well, I mean, I feel like there's a group that respects  me and a group that doesn't respect me. And they just tell me where to vote. They don't take my input. <br/>Exactly. I don't just start talking strategy with anyone. <br/>Yeah, I know. <br/>Not until I have an idea of who they are. <br/>I had a pretty good  feeling about will, but it wasn't 100%. And I don't just have a five-minute conversation, and then hop  in bed with somebody. I've got to know the core of a person, their integrity, their  value because I’m trying to win for my little girl. And I want to make sure that I’m safe. Is your moat toif work with a better group or is your motive  to--  I am willing to vote Zeke  because he can beat anybody in this game. <br/>Okay. <br/>I give people one chance  to be honest with me, and if that breaks, then I-- it's done. <br/>Working with Ken is like getting your finger and to nails  ripped out at the same time. It's excruciating, but I want to make a big move, so I have to  deal with that one. <br/>You're one of the few people I found in this game they  feel is as authentic as myself. <br/>Yeah, yeah. I respect that more than you can possibly know. <br/>I’m definitely in with  you guys, and they're writing your name down tonight. <br/>Really? <br/>That's what they just told me, they're voting for you. <br/>I don't understand that. Apparently, Zeke and his group are voting for me. I'm like, "Why?" I’m not ready to go home. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>I’m thinking we're good  to go, then Ken walks back up into camp, gets Jay, and says, "We need to  talk." and at this moment, I know we're about to have a rumble. <br/>I went and had a talk  with will, and he said you guys were saying my name. <br/>Will said that? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Is that what was said? Look at me. I mean--  One minute the solid five is good to go, like, yo, we're  doing Ken. The next minute I have Ken come up to me and say will told me  you are voting my name. <br/>I was testing you earlier  to see where you are at--  I get it, you're blowing  up my game at this point. <br/>Ken comes to me and says will just told me you're throwing  my name out there. <br/>This is my issue, guy, every time I make a move, other  people take credit for it. I would rather be playing hard than being taken to the end as a  goat. <br/>We all knew something was up. He's just a young kid trying to prove himself to the whole  world, but we still need him. <br/>I wanted credit for this  one big move. <br/>Tell me the name. I'll go with you and figure out how to do it. I have been with you since day one. <br/>Okay. <br/>We love you, dude. Let's get to the five and then we can battle it out. Okay? <br/>I had to test will to see  where he was at because I didn't feel 110% comfortable with him. <br/>Oh, geez. <br/>How'd you test him? <br/>By seeing where he stood, asking where he was at, and  going to those guys and say, "Will is saying this."  We have this plan, and Ken tests will. Revealing will's plan. That's not a test. That's a betrayal! <br/>Ken walked up to me literally two seconds after--  He screwed you. <br/>Imagine putting you in that spot? <br/>You know what? Screw it because we have five here, and I’m done with this. I want him gone right now tonight. <br/>This guy preacheseses about honor and integrity and how  he's this great and noble human being with this arrogance, extreme ego, and  he has the audacity to pull this crap on me. <br/>I don't know why Ken can  that. <br/>Now will has no incentive to vote with us. <br/>Ken just screwed up everything. Because if we don't have will, whoever that alliance led by  mobster Zeke wants to vote out, they're going home. <br/>What if David plays the idol for Ken? <br/>Who do we vote? <br/> Should we vote for Hannah or Ken? <br/>I already know it's me,  but that's okay. <br/>No, I think it's going to be me. <br/>Are you sure? <br/>Everybody knows I’m in the middle. Now I have to make a decision. The logical side of me is telling me this is my time to make a  big move. But I am so angry with Ken. I would love to blow up his game. Either way, I’m in control, and there's nothing anyone can do  about it opinio. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Michelle, Taylor, Chris, and Jessica, voted out at the last  tribal council. So, David, coming off of one of the craziest tribals ever on  "Survivor," has much changed? Or are we still locked into this two sides, only one side is  down a member. Member. <br/>Un there's no reason not to just put everything out in the open  because basically, there are two sides vying for a single swing vote right  now. <br/>Jeff: Sunday, what are the divisions? Who are they? <br/>Bret, Jay, Zeke, myself, and Ken, David, Adam, and Hannah. Will is appropriately sitting in between. <br/>Jeff: Will, how did you end up in the middle? <br/>Well, my original plan was to flip on Zeke, but Ken today  revealed to the entire tribe this plan, so everybody knows basically what's  going on. <br/>Jeff: So, Sunday, the youngest kid out here is making the  biggest decision of the night, and it is a massive swing vote. <br/>You know, will came to play hard. And I feel like he doesn't want to sit on the sidelines and feel  like all the big kids do all the work. I think he was suede a little bit today but we're hoping he  sticks with us. <br/>Hold on here. I wasn't suede at all today. I was the one who came to them with the decision disigz to try  to flip. And that's part of the issue. Everybody treats me like the 18-year-old holly kid. I don't want to be treated like that. I want to be treated like an adult because I am here to win and  play just as hard as the rest of you. <br/>Jeff: It is insulting a little? <br/>It is insulting. This is insane this crazy swing vote with me in the middle is  what it takes for people to realize I am a serious contender. <br/>Jeff: So, Zeke, everybody agrees they need will's vote. So what's your pitch? <br/>Well, will, I've always wanted to play with you in this  game. We have aligned many times, and when Taylor and Jay were under  heat, you weren't under heat because I was protecting you. <br/>But even the way he talks about it it's all about,  "I've been protecting you. I did this for you."  No, I don't, I was saying that in the least. He saved my ass at the last tribal council, and if I am here at  the next tribal council, I will again owe my life to well. <br/>Jeff: Jay, why should he come to this side? <br/>Honestly, Jeff, I have never looked down on will. I have always talked to will as equal to me and I have never  once tried to take credit for anything we've done together. We made moves together. We took up on the Michaela together. <br/>Jeff: David, the topic of big moves is vital to the game. <br/>Will feels like he really has to have something on his  resume to show at final tribal should he get there, and right now, Jay is  trying to make will feel like he already has that. But I'll say if he votes with us, his name will be on this vote  in big, bold letters and that's something to put on your resume. <br/>Jeff: Bret, David clearly just made a case to will about  going with those four. <br/>Jeff, I'll tell will right now, they'll build you up and  vote you out in a heartbeat. They've done it several times. I'm sorry. I don't buy it. <br/>Jeff: Adam, you're shaking your head. <br/>Yeah, our side has an equal partnership in terms of  decision making and the moves that are made. And will is already a part of that. <br/>Jeff: Will, do you buy that you could have five people,  and everyone has an equal say? <br/>I don't buy it. When you have five people, everybody's going to be fighting to  get their own voice heard, and five people can't take credit for one move. <br/>Jeff: Hannah, what's the mistake will, will make if he  goes with this four? <br/>You know, I think there's been a lot of fluffing will up  on that side telling him that they'll work with him. And that he gets credit for all the moves. <br/>Un what, will? Ooik not here to fluff you awp all I want to tell you, dude,  honestly, is just go with your gut, bro, simple as that, and if that's what  you feel is right, do that. <br/>Thank you, man. <br/>Will, you're nodding your head. <br/>Well, if there is one person here who has showed me  respect throughout the entire game, that would be Jay, yeah. <br/>Jeff: Well, I could sit here all night with you guys, but  it is time to vote. Ken, you're up. Ken, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now wouldn't time to do so. <br/>Sorry, Jeff, it was the only place I could keep it  tonight. <br/>What? <br/>I didn't have a bag with  me. <br/>What! Whoa! <br/>Jeff: Oh, this will be fun. <br/>You don't have to touch it, if you don't want to. I'm playing this for Hannah. <br/>What! <br/>Jeff: This is a hidden immunity idol. Any vote cast for Hannah will not count. I'll read the votes. First vote, Hannah. Does not count. Hannah. Does not count. Hannah. Does not count. Hannah. Does not count. Zeke. One vote Zeke. Zeke. That's two votes Zeke. 12th person voted out and the fifth member of our jury, Zeke. That's three. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>It's been an honor to play with you all. Keep fighting. <br/>Thank you, Zeke. <br/>Thanks, Zeke. <br/>See you, Zeke. <br/>Jeff: Swreerk the tribe has spoKen. Time for you to go. Well, here's the thing about big moves-- they're great, until  you're the one that gets punched. With only eight people left, there are a lot of knockouts still  to come. Everybody needs to have their gloves up. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor": Will tries to  take charge. <br/>Now, I’m the one calling the shots. <br/>The most insecure I've ever felt is right now. <br/>Jeff: But Adam has other ideas. <br/>I know. <br/>I do not want will  controlling my fate in this game. <br/>It's possible I went after David and his side too early. I think maybe I was excited to play a little hard. But I didn't come here to ride coattails. I came here to throw some punches and I wasn't going to go down  without a fight because I think when you play at this high level with this  caliber of players it just makes you want to play it better and maybe one day  I will.
