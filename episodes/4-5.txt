<br/> <br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor... The tribes were switched up at random, making it a brand-new game for everyone. Number of tribe members in each tribe hasn't changed, just the members within the tribe. While Paschal, Neleh and Kathy discovered Maraamu's beautiful beach... I feel like we're at a four-star hotel. <br/>To our new little family. <br/> Probst: ...Rob Mariano and Sean didn't like their new Rotu environment. <br/>Life over here is about two degrees shy of hell. <br/> We're not going to walk around here like slaves to prove anything to anybody. <br/>Probst: And Vecepia avoided all conflict. <br/>As far as the drama, bump that. I ain't with it. <br/>Probst: New faces couldn't break Maraamu's losing streak. Rotu! <br/>Yes! <br/> Probst: At their fourth consecutive Tribal Council, Sarah was voted off the island. The tribe has spoken. 12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Three days ago, we switched tribes. And now I'm over here at the Rotu tribe. Kind of gross, huh? I'm not really too happy about it. I had pretty much everything under control at Maraamu. Over here, we're five against three. And we're in the minority. <br/>Like it? <br/>Nectar of the gods. I love it. <br/>Sean definitely is done with the game. He's just laying around, he doesn't want to try to fit in at all. I'm definitely almost positive he's going to be the first to go, then it's probably going to be a tossup between myself and V. And they'll probably take me out second, because V's a lot better at... [smooching sound] You know what I'm saying? <br/> It's cool to finally get a chance to talk with all of you, get to know you all. <br/> Myself, I wanted to try to get in with their tribe, make some kind of agreement or an alliance. You consider us Rotu more than you consider the other people that were originally on Rotu? <br/>As far as I'm concerned, you guys are Rotu. Right now, that's what we deal with. <br/> I couldn't tell you that, honestly, you know, you're more Rotu than them, or them more than you. Right now, you're here. You're Rotu, man. <br/>That's the way I feel, for sure. <br/> People are worried about how long they're going to be here. These guys brought the game in with them. They brought the game with them. It started here in our camp now. <br/>Ready? We're off. <br/> I came here to try to build a society with seven strangers, but the switch sort of turned my initial experience around. <br/> Sounds like their game has been so different than ours, really interesting. <br/> It's like it was cutthroat from the beginning in their group, though. <br/> Especially if you start getting the thing where you're actually lying to people. <br/>Yeah, that's weird. <br/>They were lying from day one. I mean, these were like real relationships. Granted, we are in a game format... Not "like," they are real relationships. <br/> Be honest, stick to your, you know, stick to your ethics, and... What are the ethics in this game? <br/>To me, it's tell the truth. Be honest. <br/>Maybe. <br/>Are you saying that you would lie to win this game? <br/>Oh, I'm not even here to play the game, man. I'm here for what we had. I'm here for that society that we had of eight people. I'm here to see if eight people from all over the country, from eight different kinds of lives can come here and do this, and live and be happy. And build something amazing. <br/>But would you lie to win the game? <br/>I'm not here to play the game. <br/>But you are playing the game. You are here. <br/>No, that's not what I'm here for. <br/>Gabriel says he's not playing the game. I mean, you are here to play this game, you're not here on a commune. You know, this is not the '60s, and free love and all that kind of stuff. <br/> Once the swap happened, it really should have been game on for everybody, but I could just sense that something wasn't, you know, right. So I'm like, "Okay fine, I'll just, you know, watch him carefully, watch who he's talking to, and then I'll deal with him accordingly. <br/>Heavenly Father, we're very with him accordingly. <br/> Heavenly Father, we're very grateful for this wonderful day that we have ahead of us, and we ask Thee if Thou would please help us find all the things we need today, that we may be able to work hard together as a team. <br/> The vibe, the morning after Sarah left, was actually very good. <br/>All right. Okay, guys. <br/>I think they wanted her out just as much as I did. I think we all just bonded. We knew our team was pretty much complete at that point. <br/>This is so nice to be over here. It's like so peaceful today. <br/> It reminds me of living in Atlanta, which I did most of my life, and living in a little old country town, which I do right now. <br/> I think the point is that all four of us, are, like, we just all have this energy about us. We just have this spirit that we just all want to win. <br/> I have a feeling that we're going to win our next challenges, too. <br/> I keep hearing crabs over in the corner, what I thought were crabs in the back. The only thing I can think is that they're eating our basket. <br/> Kathy and Paschal wanted to go get crab, and then Neleh and I are like, "No, we'll all go. Let's go as a group." I think that was really the first thing that we had done as a tribe that meant something. <br/> So before you know it we were under these acacia trees and all of a sudden, these dudes, these androids were just going back and forth... And they were so easy to catch. <br/>I've got three here. <br/>I've got two here. <br/> It's really hilarious to see them, because they're all screwing around thinking they're hiding. <br/>Yow! He got me. Whoa! <br/>Oh, look, here's one right here, too. <br/>Oh, my God, look at the size of this puppy. <br/>We pocketed probably about 12 crab. Good job. <br/>The crabs then came back to camp. <br/>Oh! Oh! So we put them in one big pot of salt water and started boiling them until they change color, and, unfortunately, it does take a lot to get the meat out... but the reward is so huge. Because it's fresh plumpy crab meat. So we were just picking away, and every little thing went in that was edible. Then we just ate the biggest spoonfuls. We weren't dainty at all. <br/>You couldn't ask for anything better. <br/>Maybe little crackers. <br/>Boy, that's delicious. <br/>If that isn't a morale booster, I didn't know what is. <br/>Whoo-wee. <br/> I think we all have the spirit, and it's here, this is our time now. <br/>We're going to win today, that's a promise. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. Maraamu, lost another member at the last Tribal Council. Sarah is out of the game. They're now down to four. Rotu still a full tribe at eight. Today's reward challenge requires teamwork, but most importantly, trust. When the challenge begins, four tikis for each tribe will have been deconstructed and the 14 pieces separated and scattered out into the surrounding area. Four members of each tribe will participate. Three will be blindfolded. One person will be your set of eyes. This caller will direct the blindfolded members to the various pieces scattered in the field. First tribe to get all 14 pieces back may remove their blindfolds and then begin constructing their tikis. First tribe to get their tikis constructed properly wins reward. And this reward is a big one. The winning tribe gets to visit the losing tribe's beach and then gets to basically raid the camp. <br/>Oh, my gosh! <br/>Probst: So for Maraamu, a chance to get in this game. For Rotu, potentially a chance to put the nail in the coffin of Maraamu. A very big reward. <br/>Wow. <br/> Probst: Rotu because you have eight, you have to sit four out, keeping in mind you cannot sit the same people out in back-toback challenges. Who's sitting out? All right, V, Sean, Rob and Zoe, you four will hang back with me. You guys will get blindfolded. Let's do this, begin. <br/>Let's go, guys. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Probst: Okay. <br/>This is going to be fun, you guys, just remember that. <br/>Yeah, this is fun. <br/>Probst: Survivors ready! Go! <br/>John, move to your 2:00. <br/>John, keep going straight. <br/>Gabe. <br/>All right, John, move a little to your left. Move to your left. Straight, straight, John. Okay, turn left, John!

Great. <br/>All right, stop. All right, come on, Rob. You're almost there, almost there. <br/>Okay, you guys. Left, left. Gina, okay, right, right. Okay, Neleh. <br/>Probst: Seven Maraamu.

Okay, stop Paschal, to your right, in the basket, that's it, you got it. <br/>John, right behind you. There's some oars. The other side of the oars. That's it. It's the last one, John. Follow my voice. <br/>Through the bushes, keep going. Left, left, it's on your feet to your left! It's by your feet, keep going. <br/>Come on, straight. Come on straight. Come straight, come straight. Come on, right here. All right. Last one. Can they take them off? <br/>Probst: No, Rotu, you got 13. You're still missing one. <br/>Go down, that's it. Okay, you can run. <br/>Where's the last one? <br/>Keep coming back. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13. How many? <br/>Probst: 14, 14. Take them off. <br/>Probst: Maraamu, take them off. Rotu, still need one more. <br/>Come on, come on! <br/>I can't see it, man! <br/>All right, John, straight ahead. John, straight ahead. A little to your right. A little to your right. No, no, left. <br/>Come on, gang, let's go. Straight ahead! Right on your right, on the ground, right there on the ground, that's it. Straight to me, straight to me. A little on your left. Right here, no, no, you're right, you're right. That's it, let's go. That's 14, right? Let's go, guys. <br/>Probst: That's it, Rotu, blindfolds off. <br/>Let's go. <br/>This is done, this is done! <br/>Come on, you guys, help. That's right, that's right. Okay, keep going. Yes. Okay, okay. But where's this guy? <br/>Don't match. Yeah, these match. We're fine. <br/>Yes, where's this one go? <br/>This goes on top of this one. <br/>Yellow on the top. Hurry! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: Maraamu wins! [screaming] We won! <br/> Probst: All right, guys, we're heading over to Rotu's camp. Maraamu, prepare to raid. [cheering] Probst: Let's go, guys, this [cheering] Probst: Let's go, guys, this way. Okay, guys, come on in. Gina, this is Rotu's home. Kathy, Paschal, Neleh, welcome back to your old camp. All right, keep this in mind during the raid. These are the items you cannot take, these are the items you must leave. One knife, one cooking pot, one water container, the magnifying glass. You cannot take any personal items. Everything else is fair game. You guys have two minutes and it begins right now. Go. <br/>What about their lanterns? <br/>Lanterns? <br/>Probst: One minute 15 to go. <br/>Probst: 45 seconds. <br/>Where's their knives? <br/>20 seconds left. 10 seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. Raid is over. <br/>We did this as a team, okay? <br/>Probst: All right, Maraamu, start gathering your stuff. Your boat is waiting, head back to camp. <br/>We got the peppers. The peppers are in there. Here you go. <br/>Let me put that in there. <br/>Why are we taking a coconut? <br/>We can take, like, two trips if we have to. <br/>Good-bye, pirates. <br/>They just called us pirates. <br/>Forgot this! <br/>We should have taken the frying pan. <br/>Everything that we had worked frying pan. <br/> Everything that we had worked for this whole time, everything that we won was just, like, the rug was pulled out from under our feet. <br/> You guys, let's kind of split up and go get everything we need for dinner. <br/> A lot of times when you face adversity and you feel that you're at your weakest point, the best thing you can do is bond together and strengthen as a unit. <br/> I will start peeling taro if somebody else wants to start chopping coconut. <br/>I was going to do that after he finishes up. I felt that this was a perfect opportunity for all of us, you know, because we were still in some sense still a little divided, still with the three and the five. That this would be the opportunity for us to really mesh. <br/>Nice. We'll cook it. That's the tiniest bird, boy. Boy. <br/>Woo! <br/>We had a great time just bringing everything on shore. <br/>Oh, my God, that is so much fun! I even like seeing that sitting there. <br/> We are relishing every little item we took from Rotu, but, most of all, we were happy to put a dent in the big tribe. And we were happy that they lost, so they could experience a loss. Woo! <br/>It's an amazing feeling to have this victory. I mean, more than anything I wanted to win so bad, especially for Gina, because she doesn't know what it feels like to win. <br/> This is the first time I have ever won here and it's day 13. <br/>And that is not easy. <br/>We have blankets, we got pillows. We got a knife. We got lanterns. We got their water jugs, we got their cutting board with their name on it and we got all their hot peppers. Words cannot explain how I felt when we won. I was so happy and so ecstatic. It was the first time I'd felt as though I'd been on a real team. <br/> You know the old saying, they took everything but the kitchen sink? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I think we took the kitchen sink. <br/>I think we did. <br/> Being the underdog and coming back in a situation like this is just, like, huge. It's triumphant. It's like the best feeling I've had since I've been here. It beats any one that I had with Rotu. God, it's fun to win. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/> âª Now chillin' on my rap in the South Pacific âª Looking to my home is going to seem terrific âª Got a little taro cooking on the stove âª Got a lot of love in my little shack home âª Living out here in Survivor IV âª Never been south of the equator Dipping in the ocean... âª The new members of our tribe, and they are members of our tribe now, are really cool people. And I love it. I love that they're here, and this is Rotu. We are Rotu now, we are a tribe of eight, Rotu. âª Challenges, immunity, âª We never know the next day who we're going to be âª Because we're Rotu and we can do So lets have a rap... âª Over the last few days, I've noticed Gabriel really starting to bond with the three new members. Spending a lot of time together, lots and lots of time together. [beat-boxing] Gabriel has pretty much said as much that it's five and three and his plan was to vote them all out and to go back to, you know, one big happy family. <br/> I'm just going to reconfirm with him saying, you know, are you on board and do I have your word that you're going to stick to this? If he does then I'm fine. Two days ago, you said you were going to vote them off one by one. <br/> No, no, what I said was, I'm not here for anything that I can't show to everybody. I'm not here to do or say anything... So your goal isn't to put the eight back together then? I'm going to deal with voting people off when we have to vote people off. I'm not going to say no matter what I'm only going to vote for these three people. <br/> I don't care what you say to me, I mean, you're going to play your own game. <br/>No, I'm not! <br/>You are. <br/>No, I'm not. <br/>But I think you are. To me at that point, when he said that, I'm like, "You know what, you're done. You're not safe any more." Anybody that I'm going to vote for in this tribe, on this tribe or on a new tribe or the old tribe, I will tell you before it happens. <br/>So we just want to make sure... It just got misconstrued. That's all. <br/>Okay, are we staying tight? Is that the deal? Are we trying to put Rotu back together? <br/>John pushed Gabe a little bit too far. He hammered him on it. He pushed, and he's still got a chip on his shoulder about it. <br/>Okay, it's all good. Come here, guys. <br/>Thanks, Tammy. <br/>Yeah. <br/> At that point, I realized I had to get rid of Gabe right away. So I started to devise a plan to be able to do that. Basically, I want four people that I know will not vote for me, just plain and simple. I don't have those yet. But I mean, I just want, whether you call it alliance, an agreement or whatever. <br/> I have no intention of voting you out of here, so don't worry about me. <br/>Okay, then I'll give you the same word back. I mean, Rob, I'm serious, when I say that, that means that I will not write your name down. 100 percent. So right now, what we're shooting for, for the final four is yourself, me, Tammy and Rob. Just voting this block. <br/>Okay. <br/>We just hope we have your support for that. <br/>Yeah, of course you do. <br/>Because otherwise if we don't, you know, we're screwed. We have to vote as a block. Tammy, I'm not playing you. Trust me, 100%. I mean, I don't know what else I can say to you. Split my hand open, rub blood on you. I have your back. You are my partner. <br/>Swear you're not playing me. <br/>Tammy, on my mother's ... life. <br/>If you're playing me, I swear I'll kick your ass. <br/>What else can I tell you? On my mother's life. <br/>All right. <br/> I mean, who is going to stand here and say that they're going to swear on their mother's life? What kind of creep is going to do that? Right now, I've got Rob, Zoe, Tammy and myself. The only thing I have to really worry about is if we lose tomorrow's immunity challenge, because if that happens, I could be out. Gabe is a wild card right now, and he could turn the tables on me. <br/>Ooh, it's so simple. "Ships passing in the distance when you're struggling to survive, to get that ship's attention might just keep your tribe alive." "Build any signal possible, except no fire can you blaze, if you hear the ship's horn sound. <br/>"You just bought three more days." Yes! We can do this! <br/>We got tree mail. We're really excited. It's going to be some type of S.O.S. thing. The ship's going to come by and we've got to make our camp as colorful and creative as possible, so we can catch their attention and win immunity. <br/>Is a red triangle distress? <br/>Black. <br/> Maybe we could put our sheets together and, like, wave them up and down. <br/> We can do a red sheet and then we got black ash and put S.O.S. on the red sheets. We started brainstorming. Came up with the idea of using our blankets that we had gotten the day before. <br/>Plus we have four pillows. <br/>Use the old pot of theirs. Win immunity by using their blankets. <br/>Oh, we're going to win again! Yeah! <br/>Yeah, we are. <br/> We're like, thank you, Rotu, you know, thanks for everything. <br/>So we got to build something to hold the sheets, too. <br/>It's definitely got to be standing up. <br/>What do you think about using a triangle instead of S.O.S. <br/>Ooh, yeah. <br/>We can win this one. <br/>Yep. <br/> I want to win this immunity for two reasons, one of those is because we don't have to go to Tribal Council if we win. But the other reason is so that we can send the other team to Tribal Council. One of my hopes is that one of the three members of the old Maraamu will get voted off tomorrow night. <br/>Good-bye, Sean. <br/>Good-bye, Rob. Bye-bye! Bye-bye! <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Can't build a fire, but anything else goes. <br/>Can't build a fire. <br/> And the four that helped yesterday can't help at all today. The four people that are sitting out today, which is, myself, John Gabe and Tammy. We competed in the reward challenge yesterday, so we're not allowed to compete in this challenge today. <br/> Okay, one thing we're going to want to use is our magnifying glass. <br/>Did you help yesterday? <br/>Oh, we can't talk even. <br/>You are not involved at all. <br/> You know what, we should brainstorm with all the materials that we may use, lay it out, look at it and see what we're going to do. <br/> The way I look at it is, Maraamu might have won two challenges in a row by winning the one yesterday and raiding our camp. Because a lot of the materials that we would have used in our signal for immunity, would be the stuff they took, especially the white blankets. <br/>They have the blankets and all that. <br/> We're just going to worry about what we have, we can't worry about what they have. <br/>How about this, how about... Building a structure or something. <br/>We need to make orange standing out on a white background. <br/>Either white or the black. <br/>Black. Stretch it out on this. <br/> I don't believe that the people that are making our distress signal are the most creative that we have in the group. Our immunity fate is in the hands of the three ex-Maraamu people and Zoe. <br/>One, two, three. <br/> I have full confidence in Zoe, you know, she's been a seafaring woman her whole life. Rob and Sean have sat out both the challenges so far, so this is the first time they're actually stepping up to the plate. A lot of it is riding on them, you know, to see if they can pull out a victory for us. <br/>Good. <br/>Yeah, that's a good design. <br/>Now, how will we make the life preservers stay? <br/>We could put one in each corner. <br/> Propped up, I think we could also use it to stretch out our sign. <br/> The importance of this distress signal is that it's an immunity challenge at stake, which means if we don't pull it off, one of us is not going to be here. If we do pull it off, it also guarantees us three more days. <br/> We know this is the challenge that one person is going to be leaving and it is not going to be Rotu. So, Father God, in the name of Jesus, we thank you for the wisdom and knowledge today. We thank you for understanding, Father God. We thank you for the coming of the minds, Dear Lord, that we can come up with the best plan that we know That we can win this challenge. <br/> Even though it looks like Fat Albert and the Cosby kids' S.O.S. sign, it's still... I think it's pretty good, considering what we have. <br/>Win one for the Gipper. <br/>The Gipper? <br/>&gt; Yeah. <br/>Who's that? <br/>I don't know. Somebody says that. Some big name says that, "Win one for the Gipper." Rotu! <br/>Okay, we have our oars ready. <br/> We don't have to hoot and holler, but let's get in position and see how we're going to be. <br/>Gabe, Rob Mariano, V. and Sean could create a foursome. That would put me at a disadvantage. I needed at least one of the other new members, so I don't get myself caught in a tie, in case Gabe figured out that I was trying to vote him out. Sean, take a walk with me. So then I went to Sean because I wanted to get him to vote against Gabe. And that's no bull. I mean, I told you straight up when you first came to this camp, that I would always be honest with you. That I was never going to lie in this game, ever. Just, because... it's just this gut feeling I have. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I'm going to vote Gabe tomorrow. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/> But I do want you to know that, if we lose this one today, you're not going home. <br/>Okay. <br/>But you have to be tight. You have to keep your mouth quiet. The fact is, we need your strength and that puts your ass, you know, way up there. What I want to do is just get everybody to the merge. That's my whole point. Just get there, and then we can all just duke it out. <br/> As you see the story unfold, the consensus is that they're going to get rid of Gabe, which is surprising. I think it was a mistake that John told me that. If they're going to vote for Gabriel, they needed to just do it and let me just sit there and think that I was going to be next, or Rob or V. That's their own camp turning on one of their own. It doesn't negate what Rob, myself and V. have. Now we have the upper hand. All I'm saying is... stay tuned. <br/> We got one shot at this, so if we got the three of us with Gabe, we got a chance of going in four on four. <br/>The boat. <br/>The boat's coming? <br/>Yeah, that's it, guys. <br/> Probst: We're on board the French vessel, Kaohanuiwith Captain Lauren in the South Pacific, just off the coast of the Marquesas Islands where our two tribes are living. If you were marooned on an island, the one thing you'd want to see passing by is a ship like this one. We've asked both tribes to build a distress signal. The tribe whose signal is most clearly visible and, in the expert opinion of Captain Lauren, most likely to attract attention, wins immunity. [screaming] [shouting] Woo-hoo! <br/>Keep it going, we'll get their attention! [whistle blowing] Come on, boat! <br/>Probst: All right, Captain, we are at Camp Rotu. Grab the binoculars and let's take a look. Would this attract your attention? <br/>No, not really. They got plants, trees, it's not very clear, I don't think it's a big attraction. Maybe after the other I can see if they're better. <br/> Probst: Okay, let's go to Camp Maraamu and we'll let you decide. <br/>Okay, we go. <br/>Probst: Camp Maraamu, here we come. <br/>They're turning around. <br/>Come on, Rob, wave. It looks like they're turning. [whistle blowing] Did you hear anything? <br/>I didn't hear anything. <br/> I've always said, not for a million dollars would I do this. <br/>Yeah! <br/> I made him wear a hat today because he looks like a pilgrim boy. Look at him. <br/>Hot damn! Paschal! <br/>I'm going to kill you, Pixie. <br/>Run with it, it's cute. <br/>This is our ace in the hole right here, the American flag. I don't care where you in the world, when you see this, you recognize it. If this can't do it, there is nothing on earth can do it. <br/>All right, guys, this is it! Better do it. There's the boat, guys! [screaming] Keep it straight up and down, you guys. <br/>What? <br/>Keep it up and down. <br/>Tighten it up, Gina. <br/>Come on, guys, honk your horn. <br/>Keep it going. <br/>Probst: All right, Captain we're at Camp Maraamu. Grab the binoculars and take a look. What's your call? <br/>Oh, I see a big color red on the sand. Red ball, and American flag that attracts me. <br/>Probst: So the color red? <br/>Yes, the color red moving, and the flag, too. <br/> Probst: Comparing the first distress signal at Camp Rotu to this one, which one would more clearly get your attention? <br/>Oh, I think this one more than the other one. <br/>Probst: Very good. Okay, Captain Lauren has made his call. Camp Maraamu's distress signal is most clearly visible, would attract the attention of a ship. Therefore, Camp Maraamu wins immunity. Hold it steady, I'm going to drop some cargo. <br/>Help! Help us. Come on! Honk your horn! <br/>Oh, come on, blow your horn. <br/>I want that horn! [horn blares] [screaming] Hey, we tried. We did the best we could. <br/>Let's go get it, guys. <br/>Are you serious? <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Let's go get it. <br/>All right! <br/>Who is that under there? <br/>All right! <br/>Who is that under there? <br/>Are we feeling better, dude? <br/>I'm feeling much better. <br/> I was just telling Sean that, you know, it's like, if it is a normal merge, then we'll just go in and we take out the other side and we all just stick together, and then the worst that any of us can do is seventh place. After that, everyone just dukes it out. <br/>All right, man. I appreciate it, you know, for including us. <br/>Well, we're all a tribe. <br/>To tell you the truth, I don't believe John for a second. I think he's, like, slick, and I have a plan that may work to get rid of John. I'm just saying we have to figure out a way to spin it. I thought Gabe would have been a good way if we could get him. If we can trust him. If we could, then we'd have the advantage over here. You know? <br/> If Gabe is willing to align himself with us we may vote for John. <br/>Did we stir the taro lately? <br/>I'm watching it. <br/> If you get rid of the head and we have numbers, then, you know, the rest may fall. I look at how the cards are stacked, it's five on three. Unless there's a shakeup, either myself, V. or Rob are going next. <br/>Do you know how you're voting? <br/>No, I don't know 100% yet. I guess a lot of it is going to be how I felt after I talked to you. My only question I have for you is if you were 100% set in the way you wanted to play the game, and you're happy with it, that it's your time to go, then I have no arguments with that. I can't argue with that. If, however, you would consider anything else, then maybe we could talk, definitely a twist. A way to shake things up. Just do me a favor and don't tell anybody what we talked about right now. <br/> Rob Mariano was explaining that it's probably going to be me voted out tonight. I knew there was only so far in the game I could get doing it my way, and now I got another chance. <br/>The more zip you put on it, the tighter your spiral. <br/> I wish I had not hatched my plan so quickly with Rob Mariano and Sean. I had this little feeling that said, you know, they're going to maybe try to hatch something else. I'm a little bit nervous, is this plan going to work? And if it does, it's awesome. I'm sitting in a really great spot. If it doesn't, I'll be eating some good food tonight. <br/>So, dude, we have to bring everything? <br/>Yeah. <br/> I think of all the votes that probably have occurred anywhere in this game up to this point, this one is the most pivotal. It's huge. I think it will be the biggest move of the game. I think it will send it into a whole different direction. <br/>Probst: V. and Sean and Rob, whole different direction. <br/>Probst: V. and Sean and Rob, you guys can remain seated. The rest of you guys, there's a personalized torch behind you. Go ahead and find your torch and approach the flame. Go ahead and light it up. Put it back in its slot. For a lot of you, it's the first time at Tribal Council, and for this tribe a pretty interesting first 15 days. Started out as a very strong tribe, unbeatable, won every immunity, then suddenly your first loss. Results in a camp raid. Then you lose immunity and here you are tonight. Tammy, tonight, as of now what is the mood of this tribe? <br/>I think we're still very upbeat. I mean, it was going to happen sometime that we would lose immunity or lose some challenge, so it was just a matter time. But we had a good roll and we're still optimistic that we're going to keep winning. <br/>Probst: Anybody in here the jester of the group? So far, Zoe, who within your tribe is the person that can light the mood? <br/>Well, that is definitely Gabriel. He'll take a really down moment and it will hit just that little giggle Gabriel has, just like that. That's all he has to do is just a little giggle. <br/> Probst: Gabe, one of the benefits of this experience-- new friendships. Do you trust these guys? <br/>Is trust the biggest member of our tribe? No. People are here to play the game. People are here to win a million dollars. So trust is fleeting here, because there's only going to be one winner. <br/>Probst: John, is there a leader in this tribe? <br/> I would say if anything, I think I've stepped up if you want to call it a leader, but I wouldn't say that I'm a leader, you know, like most people would think. But I have definite leadership qualities. <br/> Probst: At this point in the game is it good to be a leader because you still want a strong tribe, or are you setting yourself apart a little and letting people know that, hmm, he's a bright guy, got to keep an eye out. <br/> I think being, basically, it's coming out of the shadows and into the light puts you at risk to a certain extent. <br/> Probst: If you were betting tonight, how confident are you that you're not going home? <br/>That's an evil question. I mean, you know, if you want on honest answer, I feel pretty confident that I'm not, but again, you know, anything is possible. <br/>Probst: We're going to vote here in just a minute. But before we get to that, what's the voting criteria going to be tonight, Rob? <br/> Tonight, I'm going to vote for what I think will be in my best interest. <br/>Probst: So at this point, it's an individual vote for you? <br/> I think all votes, when it comes down to it, are individual votes. When we come to Tribal Council, I think people in general are looking out for themselves. <br/>Probst: All right. It's time to vote. Gabe, you're first. <br/>I'm voting for Gabriel. You just proved yourself untrustworthy and we're too far into the game at this point to be wishy-washy. <br/>You've made it clear from the be wishy-washy. <br/> You've made it clear from the beginning, you're not here to play the game. You don't care about the money, and I'm here to play the game and I care about the money. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Gabe. Gabe. Two votes Gabe. Three votes Gabe. That's four votes Gabe. First person voted out of Rotu, Gabe. I don't need to read the other votes. You need to bring me your torch, Gabe. Gabe, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. In voting out Gabe, you vote out a guy who appears to be strong, kept your spirits up, works hard. We'll see how it plays out. You can get your torches and head back to camp. Stay tuned for scenes head back to camp. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/> Probst: Next time on Survivor... Paschal is stunned to learn Gabe had been voted off Rotu. <br/>I was bitterly disappointed. <br/>I knew that would break his heart. <br/>What a kid. <br/> Probst: Back at Rotu, Gabe's departure has left John firmly in control. <br/>Everyone knows I'm running the show. <br/>Probst: But Boston Rob's not buying it. <br/>Do I have "stupid" written on my forehead? <br/>I miss you guys already. The experience of being with all of you, even the new members, was really, really fantastic. But I came to experience the game, not to play the game, so this is... looks like perfect timing. You guys play safe, all right? Have a good time.
