<br/> Jeff: Previously on Survivor,  during the past four weeks, these castaways have endured severe storms that  nearly washed away their camp. <br/>Having three nights  of horrible rain is miserable. <br/>Jeff: And an accidental  fire that burned up their food. <br/>Oh my God! <br/>Jeff: A month in Nicaragua  had made one thing clear-- this is no place for the weak. Back on day five, Holly melted down and wanted to quit. <br/>I can't do it. <br/>Jeff: But after a pep  talk from coach jimmie johnson... We really do need you. <br/>Jeff: ...She staged a  complete turnaround and forged a strong alliance with Chase and Jane. <br/>One lesson I've  learned out here is quitting is an easy way out. You signed up for something. Suck it up and finish. <br/>Jeff: On day 13, rain  and bitter cold made NaOnka want to bail, but kind words from Chase warmed  her up and kept her in the game. <br/>We'll be all right. We'll make it through this. This ain't nothing. <br/>Jeff: On day 15, Purple  Kelly hit the wall. <br/>I haven't really been,  like, warm. Like every night has been freezing. It's killing me out here. I just want to quit. <br/>Jeff: But she stayed  because he was blindly obedient to tribe leaders Brenda and Sash. <br/>When it comes down to  it, it's really whatever Sash and I want. <br/>Jeff: At the last  tribal council, Holly and Jane led a conspiracy to take Brenda out. So she tried to divert attention to NaOnka. <br/>It was NaOnka wanting  to jump ship. <br/>Jeff: Brenda's  long-time ally, Sash, could have saved her if he coughed up his hidden  immunity idol. If anybody has the immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the  time to do so. But he didn't. 11th person voted out, and the third member of our jury, Brenda. <br/>Brenda was voted out  and Purple Kelly was the only one who didn't see it coming. Nine are left, who will be voted out tonight? <br/>I can't see a thing. I'm hitting a branch. <br/>It's a little further. <br/>Sash. <br/>Thanks, buddy. <br/>Yep. <br/>Tonight was wild. <br/>It was too wild. <br/>Like, I don't... I  don't understand at all what is going on. <br/>I didn't know what... Who did you end up  voting for? <br/>Brenda. <br/>Oh, you did? <br/>Yeah, did you hear  all she was talking about me? <br/>She really called you  out on everything. Brenda leaving the game, like, completely screwed me over. I was just completely left in the dark, and it's, like, thank God I haven't  been left in the dark for 28 days because I'd be going... Nuts. I feel like I have no idea what to expect from here on out. Having NaOnka, Chase, and Sash turn on me put me at the bottom of the totem  pole of any alliance I were to be a part of. <br/>So I feel we sent the  right person home tonight. <br/>Yeah, me, too. <br/>I think what she saw  is that you had flipped, and she knew you were getting information out of her  and coming back and telling us. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>But that makes me  trust you more. <br/>Right. <br/>When you tell me  stuff like that. So don't think it's going to work against you. <br/>Okay. Tonight at tribal, Brenda showed her ass. She literally threw me under the bus and ran over me forward and backwards  and then had the nerve to write my name down. <br/>So don't worry about  it. <br/>Okay. Do I look like boo boo the fool? You thought you were making me look bad? Bitch, you made me look good. <br/>I ain't gonna worry. What Brenda said about you tonight was in one ear and out the other. <br/>Okay. <br/>So don't panic. <br/>All right. And I'm not afraid of nothing. Nobody intimidates me here. If anything I intimidate them because people are afraid of the words that  I'll use when I go off on them. Whatever, she's gone. <br/>So, at this point, I  mean, if you, me, Holly and Jane stick together... Yeah, we have to. <br/>So, two people on the  outs is purple and Sash. <br/>Yeah. <br/>The problem is gonna  be getting out Sash, 'cause he has an idol. <br/>So you just blindside  him. <br/>Now my four alliance  is Holly, Jane, and NaOnka. And hopefully, I go through Sash, Purple Kelly and Fabio, but this game ain't  seemed to work like that so far, so I'm expecting something to change, I'm  sure. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Look at that, bro. <br/>Look at that mud. <br/>It's crazy. <br/>We woke up and rain  had set in. I mean, it's just a deluge. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>And what was our nice  little pond is now a raging river. <br/>See that big log  going down? <br/>It's like class-3  rapids. <br/>Hopefully, this is  going to let up because this makes camp life miserable. <br/>This is insane. As it rains and it pours, it makes me feel like crap. I am anemic, so when I get cold, my joints, they get stuck and they hurt. They, like, they freeze. It hurts. It's the end of the game, and I'm-- I'm just trying, I'm trying, I'm trying. <br/>There's no way people  understand what you go through out here. <br/>Here it comes, baby. <br/>There's just only so  much I can do. I keep trying to tell myself anything I can just to stay in the game, just  get through it day by day. I just don't know, like, physically, how much longer I can put up with this. <br/>It's really affecting  you, huh? <br/>It's just, like,  weird, too, because I feel like I never felt anything like this, you know. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And I don't want to  just, like, give up. But at the same time, it's, like, how much can I really take? It's like I made it so far and I just want to, like, try and stick in there,  but I don't know. <br/>The elements are  definitely a factor out here. I mean, sometimes it will rain for four or five hours, you know. Our tarp was obviously burned. It was coming in the front. It was cold. You just have to, you have to, like, find a mental happy place and you've  just got to say, "This is temporary. I can deal with it." You know what, you  guys? This is all going to make us stronger people. <br/>I know. <br/>You okay, nay? <br/>My ass hurts. <br/>Oh, baby! <br/>Frankly, you know, I  don't really care. I'd love for NaOnka and Purple Kelly to walk out. <br/>Yeah, me, too. It looks like we could be losing a couple. And I'm sitting back, like, hey, we're in the freaking rain forest. I mean, come on, you know. Four hours of rain, and you're going to quit that easily. You don't belong here. So, you know, go ahead and pack your bags and get out, for all I care. <br/>What's going on? You said you were ready to quit. <br/>Well, you already  know since the switch happened, how I was feel with the weather and I wanted  to leave. But you talked me out of it, and you was like, you gotta stay. We said our prayers. We did all of that. My heart's not in the game like it should be. And I've had this key forever. <br/>I know. <br/>You know, and I'm  going to give it to you because you're my boy. I wouldn't give it to nobody else. So, anyway, I'm going to give you the key to the game. There's the idol. <br/>That's the first time  I've seen it. <br/>Yeah? <br/>Yeah. I haven't seen it yet. I knew it was a key, but I ain't seen it. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Well, just know, I  mean, I appreciate the hell out of this. Naonka gave me idol because she thinks I can do well with it, I guess, and  hopefully it will help me out in the long run. <br/>You just got to work  your magic. Now you got to turn your swag on. <br/>If NaOnka doesn't  quit, then I'm still not going to give her the idol back. <br/>Don't get scatter  brained. You'll be all right. <br/>You and I and Sash  and Chase need to stick together. <br/>Oh, hell, yeah. <br/>Yeah, top four, baby. That's a no-brainer. <br/>Because if kelly  decides to stay in... No, she's going  through... She might change her  mind after she gets warm. But see, right now, I think Sash is going to stay with us, but then you've  got Danny... There's three of them. <br/>There's only three of  them? <br/>Yeah, Danny, Benry,  and Fabio. <br/>Oh, okay, all right. If Purple Kelly and NaOnka decide to leave, I think we still have a four-way  alliance between Sash, Holly, Chase and me, so that only leaves the other  three people on their own, and if we keep four strong, we can vote them out. <br/>Here's my thing. Us three and Jane. <br/>Right. <br/>Yeah This is no... I'm not  flopping. <br/>You don't... You  can't! <br/>Obviously not. I'd be stupid to. <br/>Because you learned  from the first time. Look if you had flopped with Brenda, you'd be the next one to go. <br/>I know. I do not trust Chase, Holly and Jane as much as I do Purple Kelly and NaOnka  because they're the two that I'm closest with at Libertad. So the person that does not benefit the most is me. It crossed my mind to team up with Benry, Fabio, and Dan, but I absolute wish  NaOnka and Purple Kelly would stay. <br/>Jeff: Come on in,  guys! Guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Jeff: All right, for  today's challenge, you will be divided into two teams. You'll be tethered together. Each team will have an eight-foot, stuffed dummy named gulliver tied to a  table. On my go, you will race to untie gulliver, and pick him up and carry him over  a series of obstacles. If you drop gulliver, you have to go back to the previous obstacle. First team to cross the finish line with gulliver wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Jeff: The winning  team will leave here and be taken to our Survivorcinema where you will enjoy  a movie premiere. It's a sneak peek of a movie called gulliver's travels, not yet been released  starring jack black and jason siegel. While you are watching this movie, you will enjoy movie food, nachos, hot  dogs, popcorn and lots and lots of candy. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Now, there's a  theme to this movie. The theme is it doesn't matter how big you are on the outside. It matters how big you are on the inside. You guys have survived 28 days. Your ability to draw from within will be what gets you through these last 11,  and will help you win today's challenge. Worth playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Every time we go to  challenge, I'm not going to just be mediocre because I'm ready to go. I'm still going to go 100%. I'm not going to let my team down. <br/>Jeff: All right,  we're going to do a school yard pick to get our teams. We'll get started. All right, after the school yard pick, we have our two teams. For yellow, Fabio, Sash, Jane, Purple Kelly. For blue we have Holly, NaOnka, Chase, and Benry. Dan was not selected. He awaits you at the finish. Dan has opted to back the blue team. If the blue team wins, Dan will join you on reward. Here we go. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>I got this one. <br/>Jeff: First thing you  have to do is get gulliver untied. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: Rescue this  8-foot dummy. <br/>No, don't do that  one, kelly. No, I'm already untying it. <br/>Jeff: Yellow team  already having some communication problems. <br/>Okay, I got the feet. <br/>Jeff: Holly, NaOnka, Chase  and Benry doing a great job. <br/>You guys got it? <br/>We're good over here. <br/>Heads up. <br/>Jeff: Blue team with  a bit of a lead right now. Naonka not messing around. She is up on that table. Blue team looking very good. <br/>No, no, no. Don't worry about that one. <br/>Jeff: Yellow team now  picking up the pace. We are neck and neck right now. <br/>We've got one more. That's only one. That's the only one we've got left. <br/>Jeff: Yellow team now  has their dummy released. <br/>I can't get the last  one. I can't get this one. <br/>Jeff: Yellow team  picks up their gulliver and heading out. Eight feet and very heavy. <br/>We're good, we're  good. <br/>Jeff: Blue team has  their gulliver. They're free. <br/>Take our time. <br/>I got him, I got him! <br/>Jeff: Both teams  heading out through the mud. <br/>Put his head up. <br/>Put his leg over, Jane. <br/>Jeff: Both teams  attacking that first wall. We are neck and neck right now. <br/>Come on, come on,  pull him! <br/>Jeff: Both teams  great effort on day 28. Nobody giving up. Everybody digging deep. <br/>Chase, help me hold  him. <br/>Jeff: You can't toss  him over. You've got to carry him, and that's where it gets difficult. Gulliver weighs a lot. <br/>Hold him, Benry. <br/>I got him. <br/>Got him? <br/>Jeff: We are neck and  neck. Both teams over the first obstacle at the same time. <br/>Go, go, go, go, go! <br/>His leg is caught! <br/>I got him. <br/>Run, guys. We got it. <br/>Just set him on the  ropes. <br/>Jeff: Yellow is here  first, but blue sneaking ahead of them, Benry not wasting any time. Blue has just taken over yellow. Jane getting stuck. Purple kelly getting stuck. Yellow now back out fighting for the lead. This is what I'm talking about, right here! <br/>Come on kelly! <br/>Jeff: 28 days in, and  everybody still fighting. Nobody giving up. Still neck and neck. Through the ropes. Through the hay. <br/>Head's stuck with my  arm. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: Yellow in the  lead. They're literally dragging Jane. Blue right behind. We've got a race. <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>You first. <br/>Jeff: It is coming  down to one final obstacle. <br/>You guys you have to  go over and under. <br/>Jeff: Fabio pulling  for yellow. Benry pulling for blue. This is going to come down to a close finish. Yellow with a slight lead. <br/>Come on, ben, pull  him! <br/>Jeff: Benry pulling  for blue. Chase shoving gulliver through. We are neck and neck right now. <br/>What's it caught on,  guys? <br/>Go! <br/>Good job. <br/>Jeff: Blue now in the  lead. It's been back and forth the whole challenge. <br/>Come on, guys! You got him! Come on, guys! <br/>Push! <br/>What's he stuck on? <br/>Jeff: Blue has the  head out now. Let's go, yellow! Don't give up! <br/>Come on! <br/>Jeff: Yellow, you  need to dig it right now! <br/>Twist him around,  guys. <br/>Push, push, push! Get his ass through, come on. <br/>Move the ropes aside. <br/>Jeff: Blue has half  the body through. Naonka takes a hard fall, but it's going to be worth it as the blue team wins  reward! <br/>Yay! <br/>We can't look back on  it. <br/>Should we ask them if  we can eat the chicken? <br/>Who gives a flying...  They're eating tonight. <br/>That took everything  in me. <br/>I just want a hot dog. That's all I want is a hot dog. <br/>Jeff: Blue team,  congratulations. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Nice reward coming. Dan, you picked the right team to back. No effort. You get all the reward. Here's what's going to happen. You're going to leave here. You'll be taken to our Survivorcinema. You'll enjoy a screening, a sneak peek of gulliver's travels, nachos, hot  dogs, popcorn, and all the candy you can eat. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff, can I say  something? <br/>Jeff: Yes. <br/>I've given this game  110%. This last challenge, I gave every last bit of everything that I had. And my body is just wearing down and it's tearing down, and this will be my  last day, and I wanted to go out with a bang with my winning team. <br/>Jeff: So you're  quitting. <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Anybody else  here want to quit? <br/>I... 28 days, it's  been 28 days of an adventure, but... Jeff: You're  quitting, too? <br/>One more day off a  couple of spoons of rice physically and mentally is exhausting. And a couple of hours a sleep... This is my last day. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka, you've  got 11 days left. You don't seem like a quitter. <br/>I'm not a quitter. I guess I could say, ultimately, this is my first time quitting, but, you  know, I got to listen to my body. And I'm content with the decision. <br/>Jeff: Purple Kelly,  how about you? Youngest person out here. You've done an amazing job. You're going to walk away? <br/>It's crazy, but after  the first night, I can't believe I lasted 27 more days after that. That was insane. And I had integrity the whole time. So... I'm good. <br/>Jeff: Well, I'm not  good. Naonka, you have done things out here that you have regretted days later,  like stealing food. Purple kelly, you just said it yourself, you wanted to quit early on, but you  didn't. So I'm going to give you guys the this afternoon to think about it, and we're  going to meet at tribal council tonight. And if after thinking about it, you still want to walk away on day 28 and  give up a shot at a million bucks, then, fine. I'm sure everybody else here would love it. Sound good? Sound good? <br/>It does. <br/>Jeff: You're this  close to being able to say, "I did it." and you're this close to  being one of those others, the quitters, that nobody remembers. Think about it. In the meantime, we have a reward to deal with, and here's a little dilemma. 28 days out here has been very, very tough. You just had a fire. You lost half your tarp and most of your food. You're living on a spoon full of rice. If there's one person from this winning team, NaOnka, Benry, Holly or Chase,  that is willing to give up the reward, forgo the break from camp, you can  take back for the entire camp tarp and enough rice to get you through the  last 11 days. One person stays behind, everybody else goes. This is a hero move or a heroine move. <br/>I'll do it. <br/>Jeff: Holly, not  hesitating. <br/>I need to take care  of these guys. When I go home, I'll eat as many hot dogs as I want. I have 11 days of my life. <br/>You should to it, man. <br/>Tell her to sit down  and you do it. <br/>And for these guys. You guys go have fun. <br/>You're going to go  eat tonight. <br/>Eat my share of hot  dogs. Have my share of candy, but we have 11 days left. <br/>She needs to eat. <br/>To have rice. I'll take it. <br/>Jeff: Come get the  reward. [applause] Wow. <br/>Thank you, Holly. <br/>That's amazing, Holly. <br/>After I stood up and  I took the rice and the tarp, I turned and I looked at NaOnka, and I gave her  a look like, "I can't believe that you didn't step up after you are  leaving." it told me right then and there I misJudged NaOnka's  personality. I misJudged the person that she really was. <br/>Jeff: All right, we  are going to meet at tribal council tonight and we are going to figure this  out. In the meantime, smiles over here because the four of you are enjoying a  reward. <br/>Thanks, mom. <br/>Jeff: All right,  yellow team, head on back, get some rice cooking, get that tarp put up, get  dry. Blue team, you've got a fun afternoon in store. Grab your stuff and head out. Have a good time at the cinema. <br/>Unbelievable. <br/>Get that tarp up! <br/>It's going to be  raining here in about 15 minutes. <br/>As much firewood as  we can real quick. <br/>Let's get as much  firewood as we can. <br/>Who wants to do the  tarp? <br/>Holly, I can't  believe you did that. <br/>Yes. <br/>I just want to be dry  in the middle of the night. Last night was miserable. <br/>It was bad. <br/>Grab that corner. <br/>After the challenge  today, Holly stepped up and said, "You know what? I'll forfeit my reward for tarp and rice. I can eat hot dogs whenever." it was a pretty cool gesture, you know. Holly is a genuine person. She likes doing nice things for people. It was great for me. I wasn't going on the reward anyway. So now we've got extra rice and an extra tarp. <br/>Get it over that  other one. <br/>We're going to go get  firewood. <br/>Okay. <br/>I just don't think... I'm going to give you  some advice. <br/>Okay. Please do. <br/>Okay, this is what I  tell my daughter. <br/>Okay. <br/>You came here for a  reason. <br/>Yes. <br/>The reason is to play  Survivor. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You need to suck it  up and you need to play the game. If you quit, you're always going to be remembered as the girl who quit Survivor:  Nicaragua 21. <br/>I know. <br/>What is your number  one reason for quitting? <br/>I just freeze and  freeze. And it's, like, the sun is out and so I can get through and work through it,  but it's like when there's rain... But now I got you a  tarp. <br/>I know, I know. I just think it's still... The whole food issue. <br/>I just got you more  rice. <br/>I know you did. <br/>You would rather walk  away from this game being voted out than to quit. <br/>But I just don't know  how much longer I can... I can, like, put up with this. Like, emotionally, I'm, like, a wreck. <br/>Honey, why? We got a tarp. We got more food. You got to... You got to be tough inside. There's going to be a lot worse things in life than this. <br/>Holly bringing in the  tarp and the rice definitely gives me hope, but from the mom's point of view  she said,"Suck it up. You only have a few more days." but it's like I've been sucking it up  for 28 days. I have nothing left to suck. <br/>My daughters wanted  to quit crosscountry. I said, "Absolutely not. You started. You're finishing." they ended up being state champions that year. You need to seriously think about what you're doing. <br/>I will. I know I need to. <br/>On day 5, when I  wanted to leave, Jimmy Johnson said to me, "If you stick this out, even  you make it 10 days, think of how proud your husband and your children are  going to be of you." and that hit me like a wall. And I'm like, "I'm staying." am I hungry? I'm starving! But I'm looking towards the end. And by me not quitting, I hope that I'm going to be an inspiration for my  children the rest of their lives. <br/>Okay, so mama Holly  just said what she thought. <br/>I thank you. <br/>Yeah! Yeah, baby. <br/>Oh, my! <br/>Now showing  gulliver's travels. Little movie night, baby. <br/>Wow! <br/>Yes! <br/>This is amazing! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Load it up. <br/>I'm having a hot dog. <br/>I can't believe this. <br/>Ketchup I haven't had  ketchup in 20-whatever days. <br/>Walk into this little  grass hut and frankfurters were cooking. There was fresh-popped popcorn, there was every kind of chocolate candy you  wanted. Everything, and so it was great. It was super. <br/>This is crazy. <br/>Are you serious? <br/>God! This is freaking ridiculous, y'all. <br/>I wish Holly was  here, man. <br/>She took one for the  team. <br/>I thought it was  extremely selfish of NaOnka to opt out of the game and then choose to still  go on the reward. I mean, go home, get a little bit of rice, and you know you're going to eat  well because you're done. And that's what NaOnka should have done. <br/>This is insane. <br/>This is heaven. <br/>I wasn't about to  step down because I didn't give 110% in that challenge to say, "Okay,  well, you know, I'm about to go home anyway, so I guess I'll go ahead and get  you guys the rice and the tarp." uh-uh, I wasn't about to do that. I'm not no fool. <br/>Oh, my God! Cheers, bro! <br/>Cheers. Jalapeão on that. <br/>I love jalapeãos. <br/>Should we watch this  flick? <br/>We're just having a  cold drink. <br/>Oh, she's seats are  comfy-cozy. <br/>Oh, man! Are you serious? <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>This is the first  time we sat in a comfortable seat in 28 days. <br/>I think this movie is  going to be amazing. I love jack black. <br/>Jack black is funny  as hell. <br/>He's hilarious. <br/>Gulliver's  travels,baby. Black is the new big. <br/>Please don't be...  F-fans. [screaming] Jack black! <br/>Fire! <br/>So fat. <br/>We had some fun and,  you know, we were laughing, but, you know, NaOnka definitely concerns me a  little bit. The whole time I was just thinking, you know, please leave, please leave. Get out of this game and make it a little bit easier for me. [laughter] [applause] All right. <br/>That was really cute. <br/>That's a good flick. <br/>We're going to tribal  council tonight. And it feels good, you know, to have this energy. And I just feed off that energy and it just makes me feel explosive. You never know where life will take you. It made me realize that I have to put everything into perspective. If I stayed, Dang, I could win a million dollars. <br/>We'll be excited  about the fire right here to keep the bugs out. <br/>Guys, this is a cool  setup. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Holly, that's, like,  one of the smartest decisions you you could have made. <br/>Thanks, but you know  what? Jane would have done the same thing. <br/>I know. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I want to win. Quitting has not crossed my mind. We're going to tribal council tonight, which automatically is not fun, you  know. And Purple Kelly and NaOnka are going to decide if they want to go home. So we'll see. It's going to be interesting. <br/>When jeff said today  that, like, taking the tarp and the rice could really, like, make a  difference in your game. I think that it, like, definitely can. <br/>Think positive. <br/>Anything can happen  tonight. Nothing is set. And I think that's the scariest part. The tarp and the rice cannot really get me through the next 11 days. I'd like to think that it can, but I just need to really think about it. <br/>That's a lot of rice. <br/>I think having a good  amount of rice tonight is better than having a bunch of candy and popcorn. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Pretty hot. <br/>Really hot. <br/>Definitely the  hardest tribal council for me, the decision is not gonna be final until I'm  either walking back out with my torch or leaving. <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring  in the people returning from the reward. Now we'll bring in our jury. Alina, Marty and Brenda, voted out at the last tribal council. All right, so let's get into this. We are here because today at the reward challenge, NaOnka and purple Kelly Both  said they wanted to quit. Both of you guys at different times have said and done things that you later  retgretted. So I said take the afternoon, think about it, make sure this is a decision  you want to make. Holly, there was a time when you wanted to quit this game. <br/>Uh-huh. Day five. <br/>Jeff: What happened  that made you stay in the game? <br/>What made me stay in  this game is I went and talked to jimmie johnson. And he said, "Have you ever quit anything in your life?" and I  said, "Never." and he looked at me and he said, "Then why do  you want to quit this?" he said, "You're a strong person. You need to go forward." and if it wasn't for him telling me those  words, I would have probably been gone. And now I've made it this far, and if you're going to make it this far, why  not try to go as far as you possibly can? <br/>Jeff: Jane, listening  to you talk, listening to what other people say, doesn't seem like every  day's a walk in the park. <br/>No, every day is not  a walk in the park with me. I knew I had drive. I knew I had determination, and I knew I had that spunk that would help me  get over any hurdle that came. And I'm hanging in there. I wish they would hang in here. You know, you do have to have drive. Do you have to have determination. You do have to have heart. But you've got to have that willingness to go forth that extra mile to get it  done. <br/>Jeff: So, NaOnka,  take me back to this morning. When did this start for you, this thought of quitting? <br/>Um, when it's raining  like this and it gets real windy, my joints get to hurting. So this morning it hit me, like, really, really, hard because it started  pouring and it got really, really windy, and I'm freezing. I'm literally freezing. I'm proud to say that I lasted 28 days. I'm the only african-american still here, and I'm a strong woman. I come from a background of strong black women. <br/>Jeff: Purple Kelly,  how about you? When did it first come to your head that maybe you've had enough? <br/>It came to my head  this morning and early this morning. <br/>Jeff: What happened? <br/>It was like there was  going to be no end to the weather. It was, like, this could go on for days. And I know that we can all physically take this, but my body, I just feel  like I am breaking down, and, like, I keep thinking, can I really stick it  out when I put up with some of the worst days I've ever had? <br/>Jeff: Benry, what's  your take on this? <br/>I don't know. I just don't like, you know, winners never quit, quitters never win sort of  thing. I was raised by that motto. And it's just frustrating for me to sit here and listen, you know, to these  two girls that are obviously, you know, very capable of sticking out the last  11 days. <br/>Jeff: Fabio, what's  the difference in age between you and Purple Kelly? <br/>One year. <br/>Jeff: Do you think  this is an age thing? <br/>No, I don't think  it's age. I think it's mental will power and the will to be here and what you know you  can go through. We're the same age, and I'm going to stay till the end, man. I don't care if it's snowing out here. I know what I'm capable of, and I'm going to stay. <br/>Jeff: So, NaOnka, we  run the challenge. What do you know? Your team wins. So now you have this great reward. <br/>The reward was  beautiful. It was like a celebration. You know, I've been thinking about nothing but the great things that have  happened. I had a ball today. And I looked at it like, let's have a good time. <br/>Jeff: Realistically,  you think you had any shot to win this game? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Based on what? <br/>Based on my drive  once upon a time. <br/>Jeff: This is amazing. Please, go on. Regale me with a story, woman. <br/>Well, my drive and my  attitude, my spunk, my charm. I mean, it's 28 days. <br/>Jeff: And I just want  to be clear. You think you had a shot at winning this game? <br/>I don't think, I know  I did. <br/>Jeff: All right, so  after this great reward, you watch gulliver's travels. Did you like gulliver's travels? <br/>I loved it; it was  fun. <br/>It was awesome. <br/>Good movie. <br/>Jeff: Yeah, you dug  it, Benry? <br/>Yeah, it was  interesting. Very relative to what we're going through. He had to find it in him to overcome a lot of different obstacles and it  definitely sort of hit home, and I thought maybe in watching it, it would  have hit home for her, too. <br/>Jeff: So after NaOnka,  Chase, Benry, and Holly won the reward, I said, "If just one of you is  willing to give up the reward they just earned, you could take home with you  a tarp and a big tin of rice." NaOnka, you'd already told me you wanted  to quit. You were already ready to go home, and you didn't even volunteer to take one  for the team. <br/>I didn't want to. I was going to go out with a bang. <br/>Jeff: Do you see that  at all as selfish? <br/>I don't care what  anybody thinks. I don't care about anybody's opinions. I'm still the same NaOnka I was before, and I'm still going to be NaOnka  after I leave here. <br/>Jeff: Chase, you're  shaking your head. <br/>That was the one  thing that I did disagree with. If I was going home, I would have given the rest of everyone the tarp and  rice. <br/>Everybody has their  own opinions. Everybody is going to think that I made a mistake, or I'm putting my foot in  my mouth, but I'm content. <br/>Jeff: Jane, what is  it that a young person can't see right now, they can't grasp, because they  just don't have enough experience? <br/>Well, the young kids  are going to find out life is not a piece of cake unless they've got an easy  ride from their parents. You don't have a clue what's around the corner. Life is full of rocky roads. I'll tell you that much. And life is not an easy ride for, like, 90% of the people out there. And with the economy the way it is right now, jobs are scarce. So if you don't have some sort of drive and determination to show an employer  that you're better than somebody else, you're not going to get hired. There's people out there that's a whole lot worse off than us right now, and  they're not playing Survivor. We are. <br/>Jeff: On that, let's  get down to the decision. Right now, NaOnka, you have a one in nine shot at a million dollars. Yes or no, are you going to stay in this game and fight for a shot to win it,  or are you going to quit? <br/>I'm going to quit. <br/>Jeff: NaOnka's going  to quit. Purple kelly, you now have a one in eight shot at winning this game. Your odds just improved with NaOnka quitting. You're going to stay and fight or are you going to quit? <br/>I'm going to quit. <br/>Jeff: Purple Kelly's  going to quit. <br/>I can't believe it. <br/>Jeff: That means the  rest of you just moved up two notches and didn't have to vote anybody out. Naonka, what do you think we should do with your torch? <br/>What happened to  theirs? It got smuffed. <br/>Smuffed! <br/>Is that the word,  smuf? <br/>Jeff: But, NaOnka,  they didn't quit. Purple kelly, what do you think should be done with your torch? You guys are quitters? <br/>I think it should be  snuffed, too. <br/>Jeff: All right, so  I'll snuff your torches, but we're going to keep them here at tribal council. They'll be a reminder to you guys when you come back in here as part of the  jury of the decision you made to quit. All right, NaOnka, grab your torch. <br/>That's disgusting. <br/>I hate that, man. <br/>I want to play. [kissing noises] Jeff: You want to go? <br/>Yes. <br/>Jeff: Go. <br/>Jeff: Purple Kelly,  grab your torch. Head out. Well, there's a very clear theme-- desire. That will power that comes from within. There are 10 days left. You guys now have a one in seven shot. No more excuses. It is time to step up and start playing this game. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>That's really... Up,  man. I mean, that's really twisted. <br/>I gave her so much  more credit. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for  scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on Survivor:  The seven players still in the game want it, and they want it bad. <br/>It's going to be a  fight to the finish. <br/>Jeff: The knives come  out, and no one is safe. <br/>The only person that  could beat you at the end is Jane. <br/>We're voting Jane off. <br/>And Holly will  absolutely be going home. <br/>I just don't trust Sash. <br/>Fabio's going home. <br/>Crazy what a couple  of hours can do around camp. <br/>I am very sorry for Alina,  Marty and Brenda. It's hard to look at them and know that they could have possibly been in the  top three. I feel bad. <br/>I feel like I owe  nobody an apology, not even myself. And I have no regrets whatsoever. I made it far. So to say that I did that is a hell of an accomplishment for me.
