<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor:  Oh, my God, there were three! <br/>Probst: With their flint to make fire at the bottom of the  ocean...  Oh, no! <br/>Probst: ...Koror had a horrible night at their new beach. <br/>It was a mistake for us to choose this island. I regret that we didn't think it through. <br/>Probst: At Ulong, Angie was still feeling like an  outsider. <br/>I'm just making myself a valuable asset to this tribe. If I don't, I'll probably be on the chopping block again. <br/>Probst: Survivors ready? Go! At the reward challenge, the competition was brutal. And Angie redeemed herself. <br/>Good job, Angie! <br/>Probst: Angie is across. Ulong wins reward! Ulong walked away with their first victory as well as fishing  gear... Here's fire-- who wants it? ...and their own flint to make fire. At Koror...  I got it! <br/>Probst: Ian saved the day when he helped salvage the lost  flint. [ cheering ]  Getting the box was like running a marathon and winning  first place. <br/>Make love. Don't blow too hard. <br/>Who wants theirs first? <br/>Probst: Back at Ulong...  No, thank you. I'm not hungry. <br/>Probst: Ashlee refused to eat. <br/>If we have someone slowing us down, I hope that that  doesn't bring down our team. I think I'm going to crash. <br/>Probst: And the tribe noticed sparks between Jeff and Kim. <br/>Kim's been snuggling on Jeff a lot. I mean, two-people alliance is a very strong alliance. <br/>Probst: At the next challenge... Kim, the only one yet to  give it a go for Ulong. ...Kim held Ulong back. <br/>We gotta keep going. We gotta keep going. <br/>Probst: Checking. Checking. <br/>You sure? <br/>Probst: Koror! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Koror won their second immunity in a row. Back at Ulong, Stephenie wanted Kim out. <br/>We need to break Kim and Jeff up. I mean, she didn't even try at the challenge. She sat out there. <br/>Yeah. <br/>She didn't go underwater. <br/>Probst: But there was a divide in the opinions. <br/>I was thinking Ashlee. She's breaking down, man. I can tell she's breaking down. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Kim and Jeff's relationship  came out in the open. Kim, when did you feel the first initial seeds of any  attraction? <br/>It's hot in here all of a sudden. <br/>All jokes aside, there's no alliances being built here. <br/>Probst: But when the votes came in... Second person voted  out of Survivor: Palau... ...Ashlee was sent packing. Ashlee, the tribe has spoken. 16 are left. 16 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>I really can't go back there again. Not soon. We cannot lose any more reward. We cannot lose any more reward. We can't. We can't. <br/>And, oh, Jeff was pretty tough today, I thought. <br/>That's the way this game goes, you know? <br/>Yeah. I think Tribal Council tonight told a lot 'cause Kim and Jeff  both got votes. If we would have went with our original votes, Ashlee'd still be  here, and Kim'd be gone. I think Kim's aware, and I think Jeff's aware, too. <br/>Are you serious? <br/>Mm-hmm. I know, Jeff totally pinpointed you guys, like, were a couple or  something. <br/>I know. It was obnoxious. <br/>And you know what? You can't be like, "No, we're just like really good  friends." You have to be like, "Oh, yeah, we're kind of attracted  to one another." You know, like...  It pisses me off. It really does piss me off. <br/>At Tribal, Jeff was pretty brutal. He asked me about Kim and I. I just basically said that we're keeping each other warm. We... It really does help It really does help to have someone next  to you. to have someone next to you. <br/>I think the thing between me and Jeff has just been  exaggerated by everybody talking about it. I don't want people conjuring this image up in their head that's  not accurate, and thinking that there's two personal lives, it's like  strategy or what. it's like strategy or what. I don't want that image. I don't want that image. <br/>Jeff Probst asked Kim and Jeff if there's anything going  on, you know? And they said, "No, we're just buddies, cuddling."  Mm-mm-- everybody sees what they're doing. Right now they're cuddling. Next week, they're going to be making out. You know, sucking face and stuff. She's a woman, and all she has to her advantage is her  sexuality. Kim's got to go. I'm keeping an eye on them. I got ears like a bat, I got ears like a bat, I'm telling you. I'm telling you. [ distant thunder rolling ] [ distant thunder rolling ] [  seagulls crying ] [ seagulls crying ]  Oh, man, look at that out there. <br/>It's the shower we were all looking for. It's been raining a couple times a day. We have kind of a lame shelter, and we're kind of limited to  supplies here. We're getting wet at night, and we need a better shelter. <br/>I've been digging and digging-- a heavy day it's been. I was not gonna let it go. I'm trying to focus on that damn shelter. It's been three days, and it's still not finished. This is just going to take a little thinking, girls. [ grunting ] Nine strong has its advantages and disadvantages,  'cause, obviously, we're all still together, we're still strong. Yeah, I think people are grating their nerves even worse 'cause,  you know, you can't ever get rid of anybody. You know you're stuck with them. <br/>I need to ask you something. If you can find more bamboo, do you think you can? <br/>It's hard to find. <br/>Even getting something on the other side if possible to  block out the... Someone needs to get up in that tree and do the top. Don't you think? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Won't be me. <br/>Katie is a very... I don't know what the word is; it's not  outspoken, it's tart, you know? Just that she has something to say all the time about  everything. <br/>What are you going to do with those? <br/>I'm just filling gaps here. <br/>I'm thinking we could use those for the bed. <br/>There's more, a lot more. And it's especially true with me. For seven days, I've been not saying anything, and I've just had  it. And I just decided to confront her; I want it to stop. And I've just had enough! Now, I don't want to make waves. <br/>And you're making waves. <br/>No, this is between you and me. I'm not making a scene in front of the tribe. And I don't want to bring anyone else into this. <br/>Why are you all freaked out? <br/>Because everything I say, you have some snotty remark. I throw a freakin' stick in the fire, you're like, "Oh,  they say don't throw sticks in the fire." Don't tell me what to do,  Katie! Don't tell me what to do anymore. I'm done hearing it. <br/>I was just sitting on the edge of the boat. She just comes up to me and she's, like, "Do you have a  problem with me?" And I'm like, "What?" And I started laughing  'cause she was so irate. <br/>You said the guys said, "Don't throw sticks in the  fire," like, everything I say, you're on me. Get off me! <br/>She wouldn't even give me the time to respond to any of  her accusations. She wanted to come up to me and just tell me off. And then she went off and she left. She turns and frowns. Like, I couldn't stop laughing. She's crazy. She's completely lost it. I don't need you yelling at me. I think there's a better way of doing this. <br/>Okay. <br/>If there wasn't any animosity, there is now, 'cause I  don't like people yelling at me. <br/>The repercussions of my confronting Katie will be that she  will not talk to me, and that's just fine with me. Unfortunately, there might be some tension around the tribe as  well. You will always run the risk if you're too confrontational of  being the one who's voted off, but I haven't heard my name come up. It could change now It could change now as a result of what I  did. as a result of what I did. <br/>Probst: I'll now bring in the new Ulong tribe. Ashlee voted out at the last Tribal Council. All right, you guys ready for today's challenge? <br/>We're ready. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Today's challenge is for a reward. It is once again physical. Here's how it works. On my go, a life ring will be released from the bottom of the  ocean. Your goal? Swim out, retrieve the ring, bring it back to your tribe-colored  pontoon. First tribe member to get a hand on the pontoon while having a  hand on the life ring scores a point for their tribe. Here's the catch. Aside from punching or otherwise intentionally trying to hurt  someone, you can pretty much do whatever you want to get that ring and keep  it and get back. Push, pull, dunk, splash, keeping in mind that ultimately this  is a social game. And to win it, you will need the votes of the people you are  living with and competing against. How you play it, ultimately up to you. First round, one man from each tribe will square off. Second round, one woman from each tribe will square off. After that, we'll switch things up. First tribe to score three wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Full-on sewing kit. <br/>Nice. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: I'm looking around, I see a lot of people in  underwear. We've got three buffs working as skirts. So, hopefully, the reward will change the way you guys look. But if you are resourceful, there are a lot of items you can use  around camp. Worth playing for? <br/>Hell, yeah. <br/>Probst: Koror, because you have two extra members, you're  sitting two people out. Who are you going to sit out? <br/>Caryn and Willard. <br/>Probst: Caryn and Willard will sit this one out. Everybody else take a spot, wait for my go. All right, guys, first round will be man versus man. Who's running? Tom and Jeff in the first round. Survivors ready! Go! Strategy and physical are going to play a part in this. Jeff is going to hang back. Jeff is going to let Tom do the work. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Come on, Tom. <br/>Probst: The showdown is on. Tom just put it around his waist. <br/>Good idea, Tom. <br/>Drag him. Drag him, Jeff. Drag him. <br/>Drag him, Jeff! <br/>Probst: Jeff dragging Tom, using Tom's strategy against  him. <br/>Drag him, Jeff! <br/>Drag him! <br/>Probst: He's lost the life ring! Jeff has it. Tom has it back. <br/>Get it, Tom! <br/>Probst: It is a tug-of-war. Jeff still pulling Tom. <br/>Go, Jeff! <br/>Probst: Getting closer to his pontoon. <br/>Yes! Yes! <br/>Go, Jeff! Go, Jeff! <br/>Come on, Jeff! <br/>Probst: Jeff very close. Jeff has it! Ulong scores the first round. <br/>It's all right, Tom. <br/>Probst: Next round is going to be woman versus woman. It's going to be Jenn and Steph. Steph and Jenn. Survivors ready. Go! <br/>Come on! <br/>Probst: Steph with a big head start. <br/>Come on, let's go! <br/>Probst: Steph, strong swimmer. <br/>Come on, Steph! <br/>Probst: She's got the life ring. [ cheering ]  Go! Go right! <br/>Come on, Steph! <br/>Probst: A little splashing going on. <br/>Don't let her do it. Get her! <br/>Probst: Good old-fashioned cat fight. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Jenn trying to dunk Steph, but Steph takes Jenn  instead. Steph seems to be pulling Jenn. <br/>Keep swimming! You got it! <br/>You got it, Steph. You got it. <br/>Probst: It is a tug-of-war. Steph getting closer to her pontoon. [ cheering and whooping ]  We got it. <br/>Ulong scores the second round! <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Round three is one guy and one girl from each  tribe-- Bobby Jon and Angie taking on Gregg and Janu. Ulong wins this, they win reward. Survivors ready. Go! Gregg hanging back defensively. <br/>Come on, Angie! <br/>Relax, buddy, relax. <br/>Ready to...  Angie, dunk her! <br/>Go! <br/>Probst: Angie dunking Janu, taking her out of it. Janu didn't like it. <br/>Wow! [ cheering ]  Go! <br/>Probst: Angie dunks Gregg! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Get her! <br/>Come on, Angie! <br/>Probst: Gregg dunking Bobby Jon. This is as physical as it's gotten. Angie grabbing on to Gregg, trying to hold him under. <br/>Bobby, get over there! <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon pulling Gregg. <br/>Get up here! Come on! <br/>You got it! <br/>Probst: Gregg fighting back, but it's not enough. Angie gives him another dunk. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon very close. [ yells ]  Probst: Ulong wins reward! [ cheering ] [ yells ]  That's my boy. <br/>Awesome job. <br/>Yeah. Yeah. <br/>Probst: Koror, not much to say. It's a tough physical challenge. Ulong earned it; they won it. I got nothing for you. Ulong, nice job. Good strategy. You guys worked well together. Here's your reward. Be inventive. Be inventive. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. <br/>That was so awesome. We totally kicked their ass. <br/>You're so awesome. You're so quick. <br/>It was a total shutout. I'm going to tell you what. Mmm... That's what I'm talking about. We kicked tail today and we won a lot of things. We can make a lot of different types of garments. We have so many tools. <br/>Look. <br/>This is elastic. <br/>You could use these...  This is what we need. ...as fishing hooks. <br/>The reward we won was a big, huge sewing kit. I'm not a sewer. I'm not a seamstress. I have no idea what I could do with it. Buttons, and a jar. We can do something with this jar. <br/>This here, you... That's is going to be our fishing line,  right? <br/>Yep, that little red, gold stick. <br/>I know I'm going to use some of the line that we have and  some of the metal posts that we have for fish hooks. Slip off, whoever wants to slip off, whatnot, whatever, and, uh,  we'll get some of the minnows. <br/>That sounds good. <br/>Yeah, go get some minnows. <br/>So we need to get some wood up, too, before it starts  getting wet, 'cause it's going to for sure rain. It rains every afternoon here. The win today definitely gave us a huge momentum boost. We still got a few things to do, though. There's a lot of stuff right now that's not done that we need to  do, so I'm just kind of like, if I so I'm just kind of like, if I gotta do  it, then I'll do it. gotta do it, then I'll do it. <br/>It's not much, but I think they'll like it. <br/>What are we going to do, just sit here? <br/>Looks like everybody died. <br/>I'm very disappointed in my tribe right now. I mean, there's little things that have to be done. I'm not going to wait for everybody to have a group meeting. Let's decide. Well, we need to decide and that's time, and time's wasting. <br/>Oh, so close. <br/>You know, the first few days, it was fine. I like doing stuff for people. But, man, they're going to let you do everything out here if you  keep on doing it. [ stick thudding on coconuts ]  Goodness. [ thudding ] There you go. <br/>Especially Kim, I don't think she understands the value of  work. There's lots and lots of work to do. She doesn't really see that. <br/>Are you tired? <br/>No. <br/>Are you crazy? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Bobby Jon really works his booty off, almost to the point  where we are constantly telling him to sit down, you need to chill out. I think he's playing his cards in the beginning to be safe and  cement his place into the group, and he'll be of no use if, you know, he  keeps doing this for two weeks and, like, this for two weeks and, like,  crashes and burns. crashes and burns. <br/>We all took a walk down the beach and spotted a couple of  banded sea snakes. It's definitely a sea krait, so just be careful. They are very venomous, one of the most venomous snakes there  is. We're hungry, and it was a big motivation. The plan was to just pin it down, hold it down and then lop off  its head. Okay, I can take one chop and be done. <br/>They are poisonous snakes. They're very poisonous snakes, and they can cause cardiac  arrest, coma... they can cause death, um, with just one bite. Ready? <br/>Go. <br/>Chop the snake! Chop the snake! <br/>We got him. <br/>Keep going. <br/>Sorry, buddy. I'm sorry, buddy. <br/>Ian chopped the snake's head off. He was so cute. Like the whole time, he's all, "Sorry, buddy, sorry, man. Just got to do it, man, sorry." [ yells ]  Okay, here's dinner. <br/>You know, I work with dolphins. I love animals, so to just kill a snake outright and in cold  blood wasn't for me. So, I did feel bad. <br/>Oh, no! <br/>Koror! Even without a head, I'm still not convinced he isn't going to  bite me. <br/>I was going to head back with Katie and Jenn to start the  fire. Tom and Ian, they found three more snakes, and they're, like,  "Let's get these while we can."  Nice little hari-kari stroke. <br/>Are you ready? One...  Make it hard. One, two, three. <br/>He against the wall? You got him? <br/>Yeah, I got him pinned. <br/>So he'll come out to fight. When his head comes out, man, lop it off. There it is. There it is. Get that head. <br/>You got him? <br/>We got him. <br/>Got him? <br/>That's it, Gregg. <br/>Look, he's got something in him, too, right, he just ate. <br/>That's what we saw. <br/>So it was maybe a little foolhardy, a little sense of  adventure, but, um... obviously I've hooked up with two other knuckleheads  who, uh, take fun in the excitement of things like this. And we're through. <br/>Yes! <br/>Ah! We kind of let the carcasses of the snakes hang out, but as soon  as we hung them from the tree over the water, we also noticed that a young  shark came swimming and kept making closer passes to it. <br/>Oh, there it is. That thing right there. <br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know it might be the blood from the snakes dripping in the  water. We kind of got interested that maybe we could trade our snake  with a shark. <br/>A few of 'em...  If I saw a shark at Jones Beach on Long Island, we would  all be running out of the water. We see a shark fin go by here, everybody runs into the water  with sticks in their hands. <br/>Probably the stupidest thing I've done in a while,  but...  You know, the motivation is there; we have to get food in  us. <br/>See 'em? <br/>They see it. Yup, they're coming closer. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Oh, my friggin' gosh. <br/>You think they're interested in that? <br/>Let's see if we can, uh... They got, they got... They keep  getting... Oh, here comes on. Okay, here comes one. Don't move. Don't move. There he is. There he is. Holy... Oh, he saw me. <br/>Gosh, he came so close. <br/>Hey, Jenn, you want to chop up some more, some more snake? They really were close. They were wily. Close enough to make you nervous, like, they come straight at  you and make you a little bit heebie-jeebie. Yeah, that's good stuff. Nice and bloody. Oh, that's nice and bloody. <br/>It's a game of survival as well as strategy, and the  survival aspect of it is more real than I ever imagined, and also, the  thought of having shark steaks on a frying pan is the motivation that takes  you past the fear of a shark. <br/>There he is. Oh, my gosh, he's right there. Uh, two. Two left. Oh, man. There's three of them around. Bam! Bam! He took it. Got really close. <br/>They would get to just out of reach of us. I took a lunge at one and missed, but they knew we were there,  and would just probe so far, but no closer. We had sharpened sticks, which I don't think would really go  through shark skin. He's big enough to put a hurting on you, that guy. <br/>Yeah. We're going to back off the... the snakes and redouble our  effort on the sharks, I think is our plan right now. I think is our plan right now. We're going to get a shark. We're going to get a shark. <br/>Ow. Going out to use the little boys' room real quick, and came  walking down the beach, stepped on a loose coconut. Just my luck, rolled it on my ankle that I had problems with  last year. I'm just going to try and keep it up right now. Hopefully, get all the fluids out of it. Maybe wake up in the morning and be a new man. and be a new man. Let's hope. Let's hope. <br/>What's up, buddy? <br/>How you doing? <br/>Pretty good. How are you? <br/>I'm all right. Making yourself a diaper? Be careful, buddy. You might be piercing something you don't want to pierce. You need help, but I'm not going to help you. <br/>Right, right, right, right. <br/>Right, right, right, right. No, it's all good. No, it's all good. <br/>There's a lot on my mind this morning. Got a lack of sleep last night because of my ankle. I tried to keep it elevated throughout the night, but the pain  is still there, so I'm going to try and take it easy today and, you know, I  want to try and save my energy until maybe our next challenge until maybe our  next challenge so that I can do my best. so that I can do my best. <br/>We got a challenge. <br/>We got a challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>How's your ankle feel? <br/>Horrible. <br/>Horrible? <br/>"The weight of the weak lay on the shoulders of the  strong. Today's challenge will show you where in the tribe you belong. 'Can I go any further?' You may have reasonable doubt, but let  your tribe down, tonight your torch could go out."  We got tree mail, and it was the one tree mail that's  talking about pure strength, and I've got it. I just, at this point, hope to God I can use it. It's totally my luck. I hurt my ankle, and we think we have a challenge in a couple  days, but we have it the very next morning. If I mess up today, it's on my shoulders. I want to win this challenge more than I've wanted anything. I want to carry this tribe all the way to the end of this game,  and I'm going to do anything and I'm going to do anything I can to do that. I can to do that. <br/>Probst: All right, first things first. Willard... Take back immunity. Immunity back up for grabs. Before we get to the challenge, I got to ask, Jeff-- you were  hobbling in here. What happened? <br/>I rolled it last night in the middle of the night on a  coconut, and heard a snap, crackle, pop. And I'm just trying to take care of it right now the best I can. <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready for today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: It is for immunity. Here's how it works: You're each going to be wearing a belt. That belt will be clipped to a common rope, so you will move  together as a tribe. In addition, you'll be carrying a backpack with 20 pounds of  sand in it. Starting on opposite sides of an oval course, you will race,  trying to catch the other tribe. If a tribe member gets tired, and they want out, they can opt  out of the challenge, but they have to take their weight off and give it to  another tribe member, then unclip. So they're out of the challenge, but the weight is still in the  challenge. Somebody will have to carry that burden. First tribe to catch the other tribe and touch one of their  tribe members wins immunity-- doesn't go to Tribal Council. For the losers, somebody going home tonight. Big enough stakes? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: Koror, you still have two extra members. You're sitting two people out. Who's sitting out? <br/>Jenn and Janu. <br/>Jenn and Janu. <br/>Probst: Jenn and Janu are sitting out. Everybody else, take your spots, wait for my go. Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready. Go! Right away, Jeff gets rid of his weight. He's unclipping. Can't run on that ankle. Going to take strength and strategy to win this. <br/>Wait! Wait! <br/>Faster, Caryn. <br/>Wait! <br/>Somebody's down. <br/>Probst: Caryn's down. She gives her weight to Tom, and she's unclipping. Tom is now carrying 40 pounds. Caryn is out of this competition. Ulong gaining some ground. Willard's out of the race. He gives his weight to Gregg. <br/>I can't do it. <br/>Give me the belt! <br/>Probst: Kim falls down. She's out. She gives her weight to Bobby Jon. He's now carrying three backpacks. Angie opts out. James has her weight. Ulong down to four members. Koror with four members, as Katie drops out. Stephanie the only woman left in this challenge. It is very hot out. It is very hot out. Heat really taking its toll. Heat really taking its toll. <br/>Coby, dig deep, will ya? Come on! <br/>Probst: Walking through this water, harder than it looks. <br/>All right, here we go! Pick it up! Move! Come on. <br/>Probst: Tom leading Koror strong. Gregg doing well. Coby trying to keep up. <br/>Yo, they're going to catch us if we don't jog. <br/>No they're not. <br/>Yes they are, they're getting close. <br/>Look at Coby. <br/>Probst: Coby going to opt out of this challenge. Gives his weight to Ian. Ian gives the weight to Tom. Tom now carrying 60 pounds. Tom, Ian and Gregg against Ibrehem, Bobby Jon, Steph and James. Ulong trying to make a move in a full-on sprint, carrying a lot  of weight. Steph showing no signs of slowing down. All right, let's have a burst or something. No one's holding us back, all right? We hit the shallows, we dash. <br/>Just think of Tribal Council, guys. We don't want to go. <br/>Probst: Koror trying to make up a little ground each  round. <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>Guys, they're getting closer. <br/>James, give me one of them bags. <br/>Wear them down, guys! Wear them down. Come on. In front of me! In front of me! <br/>Probst: James, giving another bag away to Bobby Jon. I'm good. <br/>Probst: Koror making up some ground, closing that gap on  Ulong. That kicks Ulong into gear. <br/>Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! <br/>Probst: Ibrehem winded. <br/>Close, guys. Come on. <br/>They're wearing out. Look at them-- they can't even go through the shallows that  fast. We can, so let's do it. <br/>Probst: Ulong really slowing down. James going to opt out of this challenge. Bobby Jon now with 80 pounds. The longer this challenge goes, the deeper the water is getting. the deeper the water is getting. The tide is coming in. The tide is coming in. We're down to three on three. It's Tom, Gregg and Ian for Koror. Really closing the gap. Ibrehem, Bobby Jon and Steph for Ulong. Ulong going to have to kick it into gear. Do they have anything left in the tank? Ulong's been to two straight Tribal Councils. Doesn't want to go back again. <br/>I think we have to jog. <br/>Probst: Koror has yet to go to Tribal Council, and there's  no rush to get there. Koror making a move. Bobby Jon now takes the lead. <br/>Let's do it, guys. Burst. Little burst. <br/>Probst: Koror is making up ground in tiny increments,  closing the gap slowly but surely. Steph looking over her shoulder as Koror gets closer and closer. Does Ulong have anything left? <br/>Go, guys! Koror! Whoo! <br/>Probst: Koror is making a move. Ulong very close to going back to Tribal Council. Immunity at stake! Koror wins their third Immunity Challenge in a row! [ cheering ]  Koror! [ cheering ]  Probst: Koror, once again, immunity going back to camp  with you guys. No Tribal Council, safe from another vote. Ulong, sadly, you're getting all too familiar with Tribal  Council. Tonight, you will return and vote out yet another member from  your tribe. from your tribe. Head on back to camp. Head on back to camp. <br/>All right, everybody, I want to talk to all you guys. First all, I think everybody tried their heart out today. I'm really sorry that I couldn't help participate. But I know there's no possible way that I can get to the end  with a busted-up ankle, especially in these conditions. I know, myself, in three weeks, my ankle may start getting  better. <br/>Really? <br/>In these conditions. I'm not, I mean...  You don't even think, like, a couple of days...? <br/>To tell you the truth... There's no way. I can barely put any weight on it right now without clenching my  teeth. Like, every time I step, I feel like a tear is going to come out  of my eye. If I stay in here, you guys aren't gonna get to the end. <br/>I don't want you to leave here, though, and in two days  your ankle will be feeling fine and us be like...  So we're going to vote out someone else instead? There's no reason to vote off anybody else. All right? <br/>Yeah, we want you to stay. <br/>Soon as we got back to the beach, old Jeff said, "Guys,  you need to vote me off." Oh, we were sad, you know. We didn't want to vote him out. He's strong, you know, he does a lot around here, you know? And the person we were planning on voting out, which is Kim,  does hardly anything. <br/>We vote Jeff off, it's going to be like two people gone  anyway, 'cause she ain't did none of the challenges. She ain't do nothing around the camp. <br/>Yeah, she's down there laying up, ain't doing nothing down  there. <br/>She's so happy 'cause she thinks she's okay tonight. <br/>That boy's tough. <br/>Yeah, I'd rather, nurture him and feed him. I feel very strongly that Jeff should stay. We should get rid of Kim for sure tonight. Jeff's weakness is our strength. Even when he's down, he's ten times stronger than Kim. I'm definitely going to go talk with other people in the tribe  and see what they think. <br/>Bobby Jon, I don't know about you, but just to let you  know, I'm voting for Jeff. <br/>You are? <br/>Oh, yeah. I planed on voting for Jeff as soon as he hurt his ankle. <br/>Okay. <br/>And I'm not swaying from it. <br/>Okay, cool. Well, I ain't voting for him, 'cause I'm voting for Kim, because  I'll be danged if I'm going to feed somebody when they don't do nothing. <br/>Yeah. Some of the other tribe members want to vote off Kim, and I can  see that because she didn't really do much, but I'm kind of hoping once Jeff  goes she'll start maybe doing a little bit more instead of just thinking  about Jeff. <br/>Yes! Check it. Hey, I can cut them right in half with one cut. <br/>Watch this. You watching? <br/>What are they doing? <br/>Come here, come here, come here, come here. Come here... come here! <br/>What's he cutting, coconuts? <br/>Just watch. Just watch. Watch, watch. <br/>Yes! <br/>You're just doing it to be a bad ass now. <br/>Now I am. Heck, yeah. <br/>She can't do that, okay? <br/>Okay. <br/>She's gone. Or is he going? Still tough? <br/>Still tough. We'll see. <br/>Perfect day to leave. Beautiful, warm. <br/>We need you. <br/>I know what you're saying, but just let me enjoy this one  day. <br/>It's not logical to get rid of you. I think you're afraid that somebody else is going to get voted  off. <br/>Huh? <br/>Well, it is right before Tribal, and, of course, people  are whispering, and I don't know what conversations are taking place. They could be all be over there conspiring and, "We're not  going to vote for him. We'll see what his ankle does."  That's cool. <br/>I think that's cool. <br/>I'm feeling vulnerable. I mean, there's no way of telling what could happen. I definitely think there's a chance that there's a chance that  Jeff could be here tomorrow. Jeff could be here tomorrow. <br/>Probst: You guys got to be getting tired of seeing me  here. <br/>Oh, we're tired of it. Very tired. <br/>Probst: Ibrehem. Three immunity challenges, three losses. After tonight, three tribe members gone. Koror still standing strong at nine. Gotta be a little frustrating to continually get pummeled in  these challenges. <br/>Uh, it is very frustrating, but honestly, today, I know if  we would have had one person in there who we really needed, we would have  won. <br/>Probst: You're saying if you had Jeff you'd have won the  challenge? <br/>I'm saying, if we would have had Jeff, we would have won  the challenge. <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon. Jeff really the difference in this? <br/>No, he wasn't. The difference was, is-is Tom for Koror is what the difference  is. He's a man. He's a man among men, and he single-handedly whipped us, I  think, today, to be honest with you. <br/>Probst: Ibrehem, you're shaking your head. <br/>I don't think Tom single-handedly beat us. Him and his team did it together. We did good, but after a while, you know, Bobby Jon had 80  pounds on him. We just needed that extra man, and that's just point-blank what  it was. <br/>Probst: Steph. How long after getting back from the challenge did the  finger-pointing begin? <br/>When we got back, actually, Jeff sat us all down and he  just pretty much said that he's really hurting right now and he doesn't know  how much use he's going to be to the tribe. No one really got a chance to point fingers. He just gave us a lot to think about coming into Tribal Council  tonight. <br/>Probst: Jeff, you got the weirdest look on your face. You're smiling. <br/>You know what? Jeff, I've always been a team player my entire life, and I  really think that I screwed up my ankle, and it was a deathful thing for me  as well as my team. I'm not saying that we would've have won today had I been there,  but I know that we would have had a better chance. That would have been 20 pounds off one of these guys' backs. <br/>Probst: What's your point? <br/>My point is that I want to be able to help the tribe in  any way possible, and at this point, right this second, I can't. I can't do anything. <br/>Probst: Ibrehem. What are the other reasons that you're starting to notice about  why you might vote people out? Is it to a point now where you're starting to notice who really  is doing the work you need versus who is starting to say, "You know,  we're okay. I think I can take a nap this afternoon"? <br/>I think everybody works hard, but sometimes people might  get a little tired and might not want to put in as much effort as everybody  else. <br/>Probst: But when it comes to voting somebody out of the  game...  That can play a big part in it. That can play a big part, in my opinion. <br/>Probst: Kim, you seem very frustrated tonight. <br/>It's not that I'm frustrated. I mean, I'll admit to you, it's it's hard being on this team  when you have these guys that are super-strong and tons of stamina and  workaholics. Like, I could never measure up to Bobby Jon. I mean, he's freaking Tarzan. And it's frustrating losing. I'm so sick of being here. I'll be honest with you, if he wasn't going home then I would  know that I was one of the people on the cutting block, chopping block,  whatever, because our tribe's obviously manifested itself to be a tribe that  the strongest stay and the weakest go, and it's not that I'm weaker than the  average person, it just means in this tribe, that might be where I fall. <br/>Probst: James. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: At any time today was there any dilemma, "Do  we give him his wish or do we keep him"? <br/>Yeah, there's been a dilemma. We've been debating all day long on whether or not to keep Jeff  or let him have his way, and we're probably still debating. It's just running through our head, you know. We don't even know what we're going to do until we do it. <br/>Probst: Clearly this tribe has not yet made up its mind. Let's see which way you're going to go. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. James, you're up. James, you're up. <br/>Kim... you are lazy. You don't do anything. You get out of the race a day early. of the race a day early. You are not a helper. You are not a helper. <br/>You've become one of my greatest friends on this island. I'm happy I got to know you, but this is what you wanted, this  is what you wanted, so this what is I'm going to do. so this what is I'm going to do. <br/>Everything's fine, but tonight I'm not going to play you  and Jeff's you and Jeff's little silly-ass game. little silly-ass game. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote. Jeff. Jeff. Two votes Jeff. James. Kim. Two votes Jeff, one vote James, one vote Kim. Kim. That's two votes Kim. Two votes Jeff, one vote James. Jeff. We're three votes Jeff, two votes Kim, one vote James. I'll read the last vote. Third person voted out of Survivor: Palau. Jeff. Jeff. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Kill Koror. <br/>Probst: Jeff, the tribe has spoken. the tribe has spoken. Time to go. Time to go. You had a tough first eight days. So the question is, how do you turn tonight's vote into  something positive? Grab your torches, head back to camp. head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. Next time on Survivor:  I've never lost this bad in my entire life. <br/>Probst: Ulong gets desperate. <br/>Don't freak out. <br/>Probst: And the tribes have a big decision to make. <br/>"Choose one tribal representative to make some  important choices."  What if the person who goes doesn't get to come back? <br/>Probst: You have not picked  Probst: You have not picked a representative yet? a representative yet? <br/>There is a huge part of me that wishes that I had not  injured myself to the point of being unable to help my team advance in the  game, and it was my choice, and I know that by making that choice, my team is  going to be able to advance further in the game. Ulong, it's time Ulong, it's time to take Koror to the cleaner.
