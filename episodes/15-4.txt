<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor:  Oh, wow! <br/>Probst: At Zhan Hu, Dave's tribe mates urged him to stop working and save his  strength for the challenges. <br/>I just want you to conserve your energy because I do not want to lose another  challenge. <br/>Peih-gee. [makes kissing sound]  Probst: Sherea and Jaime taking on Amanda. Amanda is in the water. After losing four challenges in a row, Sherea finally led the Zhan Hu tribe  to victory... Zhan Hu wins their first challenge! ... giving them the right to kidnap a member of the other tribe. Who are you going to steal? <br/>Leslie. <br/>Probst: Leslie. At Zhan Hu, Leslie bonded with her fellow Christians. <br/>I'm misunderstood over in my tribe. My faith is everything. <br/>Probst: And she gave Jaime a clue to the hidden immunity clue to the hidden  immunity idol. idol. At Fei Long, poker player Jean-Robert continued to bluff his tribe mates by  acting weak and tired. <br/>Later on, when I am contributing, people are noticing, "Hey, this guy is  doing beyond his normal capability."  Probst: Go. At the immunity challenge, Fei Long was frustrated because Courtney was too  weak to hack it. <br/>How are they doing this? <br/>Probst: And Sherea was the hero again, pulling Zhan Hu to their second  straight victory. Zhan Hu wins immunity! With Fei Long facing their first tribal council, Courtney attempted to save  herself by targeting Jean-Robert. <br/>I think if he goes and I  I think if he goes and I stay, then it will be different. stay, then it will be different. <br/>It's a very friendly tribe. Three of them are Christian, which is, I think, why they picked me. <br/>Probst: But the alliance of Aaron, Todd and Amanda grew worried about  Leslie's bond with the other tribe. <br/>I just feel Leslie is more dangerous than Jean-Robert. We need to take her out. <br/>Probst: At tribal council, the alliance got their way. Jean-Robert and Courtney were spared... Third person voted out of Survivor:  China. ...and Leslie was voted out. 13 are left. 13 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Is it too early for us to put the water on? <br/>No. <br/>No? <br/>No, as soon as it starts to  No, as soon as it starts to get hot. get hot. <br/>I thought there was a small chance I could go home last night, but I figured  I'd be staying. I'm a professional poker player. And my game plan is starting to kick in. I'm one of those guys who likes to start out in last place. I was the last horse. Now, I'm just slowly edging up on the pack, and I've kicked ass in the  challenges, and my work ethic in the camp has improved, and people notice  that. <br/>You're like sucking it up already. It's, like, 6:00 in the morning. <br/>Getting past last night's vote was big, but at the next tribal council, I'm  not that worried, either, because Courtney is always the weak link in every  challenge. And if she survives the next tribal council, she's got to be the luckiest  girl in Survivor the luckiest girl in Survivor history. history. history. <br/>I was afraid it might be hot. <br/>I was afraid it might be hot. <br/>I was afraid it might be hot. <br/>I was trying to protect you. <br/>I was trying to protect you. <br/>I'm not getting mad at you, so you don't need to get huffy. Waking up with Jean-Robert still here is just how I knew it would be. He's a cocky son of a bitch, and he sucks so bad, there's no getting out of  that. <br/>That was like a cautionary, like, "Careful."  I understand, but just so you know where I'm coming from, I have a gut  reaction, I don't like anyone raising their voice to me. I don't give a crap who goes next, as long as it's not me. I would prefer it be Jean-Robert because he's just so unpleasant and he gets  in my face with no matter what I say. He's just aggressive with me, He's just aggressive with me, and I'm sick of  it. and I'm sick of it. [theme song playing] Captioning sponsored by CBS and PARAMOUNT NETWORK CBS  and PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION TELEVISION  Is it really wet on the  Is it really wet on the bottom? bottom? <br/>Oh, no. <br/>It's kind of stinky. <br/>This morning, we discovered a large portion of our rice has mold on it. That's bad news. So, we tried to separate out the good stuff before it gets the good stuff  before it gets worse. worse. <br/>Before you pick it up and start mixing up that gunge over again, we need to  put it in something else and toss the moldy stuff. <br/>What do you suggest we put it in? <br/>I don't know, man. Find something. Find something. Think of something. Think of something. <br/>Great, you can get that. <br/>Great, you can get that. I'm not eating mold! I'm not eating mold! <br/>Okay, great, you ask for everything. You are not running the show up in here. People have ideas, too. <br/>Thanks for listening, Sherea. <br/>Same way you do with everybody else. You just listen, listen, listen, right? I don't think so. You want everybody to listen to you, but you don't listen to nobody else, so  shut... stop talking to me, please. <br/>Sherea, she just came unglued on me. You know, you've got some grounds to say those kind of things if you've done  more around camp. I'm doing my best to be a good leader. leader. So, it's frustrating. So, it's frustrating. <br/>Sherea! <br/>Sherea! Please do not throw those away. Please do not throw those away. <br/>I wish you wouldn't touch me. <br/>Please don't do that. I'm saving some of these shells! <br/>Back up off me! Back up off me. Back the [no audio]up off me. <br/>Why...  I swear to God, back up off me. <br/>Why won't you give me some of the shells? <br/>Back up off me. <br/>She won't let me keep the  She won't let me keep the shells! shells! <br/>The last day or so, Dave, I mean, he's been digging himself a grave further  and further and further. <br/>My God, I just asked to save a few of these things so I can take them back to  my mom, you know. <br/>He's just very condescending the way he talks to people. But nobody is going to run over me, talk to me any kind of way. <br/>I'm not so hot on Sherea right now because she's holding on to stuff that I'm  not. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>And everyone else is on eggshells, I think, more because of Sherea than me  right now. <br/>People right now are seeing you as something who's just going off all the  time. I do admit you've given a lot of great stuff to this tribe and we wouldn't be  the tribe that we are without you. We just have to make sure that if you're going to be a if you're going to be  a leader... leader... Dave's put himself in a weird position with everybody. I mean, he does help around camp but he's also pissing people off. So Crazy Dave may have just So Crazy Dave may have just worn out his welcome. worn out his welcome. <br/>Tree mail! Let's go! <br/>Is it tonight? <br/>Tribal council. <br/>Tribal council? <br/>What? <br/>Oh, boy! <br/>"Tonight, both tribes go to tribal council, where fire represents your  life. In the shadows of the temple, the winners earn less strife. This doesn't require lots of brawn, but if you're not agile, you'll take a  beating. Only the tribe who can stick together tomorrow will be together tomorrow will  be eating." eating."  I don't think so. I think it's just at the tribal council. <br/>Food! <br/>Oh, my God, you guys. We have got to win this! <br/>Let's win this food, brother. I'm thrilled about this tree mail because they're talking about food. I'm a pretty big eater already, and the last three days I've virtually eaten nothing. So, for me it's not just exciting, it's, like, necessary. necessary. I need to eat something. I need to eat something. I need to eat something. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. Zhan Hu getting your first look at the new Fei Long tribe. Leslie voted out the last Leslie voted out the last tribal council. tribal council. Guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. [applause]  Probst: For today's challenge, two tribe members at a time will use giant  chopsticks to carry a fireball across the course, drop it down a chute into a  wok, igniting a firework display. You'll then race back to the start. The next two go. Each round, the chopsticks will get longer and more difficult to handle. First tribe to get all three fireballs into all three woks wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: Tomorrow morning, a fisherman and his family will come to your camp  and teach you to fish. They will bring with them spices, vegetables, make you a meal. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: In addition, the winning tribe will kidnap one member from the losing  tribe. That person will stay with them until the next immunity challenge. Fei Long, because you have one extra member, you're sitting one person out. Keeping in mind you cannot sit out same person in back-to-back challenges,  who are you going to sit out in this one? <br/>We're going to sit out Courtney. <br/>Probst: Courtney's going to sit this one out. Courtney, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize. minute to strategize. We'll get started. We'll get started. All right, here we go. The first two for Zhan Hu, Peih-gee and Sherea. For Fei Long, it's Todd and Denise. For reward, survivors ready? For reward, survivors ready? Go. Go. Got to light the ball and then pick it up. Sherea and Peih-gee working together. Denise and Todd working together. <br/>There you go. Nice. <br/>Probst: Each person has one chopstick. You have to figure out how to work together. <br/>Go on the other side, Sherea. Go parallel, parallel. <br/>Go slow. <br/>Probst: Denise and Todd making a little progress. <br/>Cross under. <br/>Probst: Can't push the ball. Got to pick it up. Sherea and Peih-gee had it going for a moment. Todd and Denise doing very well. Peih-gee and Sherea getting the Peih-gee and Sherea getting the hang of it  now. hang of it now. <br/>There you go, guys! <br/>Probst: Peih-gee and Sherea work together. Peih-gee and Sherea gaining on them now. Todd and Denise very close. No! They drop it just short of the chute. Peih-gee and Sherea very close. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Todd and Denise have their first ball down the chute. their first ball down the chute. They're heading back! They're heading back! Peih-gee and Sherea still working on that first fireball. They have it for Zhan Hu, and They have it for Zhan Hu, and they race back! they race back! Amanda and Aaron, working together now on that second ball for Fei Long. It's Jaime and Frosti now for Zhan Hu, working on that second fireball. The longer the chopsticks get, the more difficult they are to handle. <br/>Up, up. <br/>Probst: Frosti having to maneuver with the flames hitting his hands, burning  him. They're on the wrong side of that flame box. Amanda and Aaron working together, moving slowly but making ground. <br/>A little bit at a time. <br/>Probst: Jaime and Frosti still in it. Both tribes even with one ball. Aaron and Amanda doing a great job. Jamie and Frosti trying to gain on them. Aaron and Amanda have the big task now of getting up high enough to drop it  in the chute. Aaron and Amanda have it. They have their second one for Fei Long. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: Amy and Frosti close. Jamie and Frosti have the second ball for Zhan Hu. We are dead even. James and Jean-Robert working on the third and final ball for Fei Long. <br/>These sticks are impossible! <br/>Just focus, man. This is not impossible. <br/>I got it, I got it. <br/>Probst: It's Dave and Erik now for Zhan Hu. James and Jean-Robert making a little progress. Dave and Erik working with those long chopsticks, much more difficult. <br/>Ah! <br/>Go forward with it! You have to move at least an inch every time! <br/>Probst: Dave and Erik getting a lot of advice from their tribe. It's not helping. James and Jean-Robert getting closer. Big reward on the line-- fish, vegetables, spices. Dave and Erik are going to have to do something heroic. Jean-Robert and James very close. This could be it. Jean-Robert, so close. <br/>Dave, get low! Dave, get low! <br/>Go at the same time. <br/>Probst: James and Jean-Robert so close. Trying to hang on. Almost had it. Opening the door for Erik and Dave. A few inches at a time, they are gaining on James and Jean-Robert. <br/>Lift it like this. <br/>Probst: Next fireball down the chute wins. This could be it for Fei Long. And it is! [cheers]  Yes! <br/>Probst: Fei Long wins reward! <br/>Yes! <br/>Yes! <br/>Oh, yeah! <br/>Oh, yeah! <br/>Probst: All right, Fei Long, congratulations. [applause] You're now going to kidnap one member of Zhan Hu's tribe. Who's it going to be? <br/>Dave or Jaime. It doesn't matter. <br/>It's Dave. <br/>Probst: Dave, head on over. You are going to spend time with Fei Long. Dave, you will remain with Fei Long until the next immunity challenge. All right, Dave, this is for you. You know the drill. It says, "open in private." That means private and alone. Zhan Hu, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>See you, folks. <br/>Bye. <br/>Probst: All right, guys, grab your flag. Head on back to camp. Head on back to camp. Enjoy tomorrow. Enjoy tomorrow. [laughs]  Yeah! Escargot, dawg. <br/>Oh, man, I feel like I'm on vacation right now. It's just absolutely wonderful. I'm going to eat well with them today. And given the friction between Sherea and I, I couldn't ask for a better time  to be kidnapped. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, everybody. What you eating on there? What you eating on there? <br/>You're right, you're right. I apologize. Some of my tribe are definitely threatening to me, and that means I'm going  to have to be aligned with other people. So it is a spy mission, but So it is a spy mission, but it's a spy mission  for me. it's a spy mission for me. <br/>"In this sealed tube is a clue to a hidden immunity idol. You must give this sealed clue to a member of this tribe before you rejoin  your own tribe." [laughs] Great. I've got to chew my noodle on who am I going to give the clue to the hidden  immunity idol to? This could be a crucial play for me right here in terms of who I give this to  and how it can come back to help me later. Let's see here, what is it you Let's see here, what is it you do, Courtney? do, Courtney? <br/>No kidding, man! I love that place! You make me miss New York so much! I want to go back. <br/>Dave is a nutcase. <br/>I can give you... I can give you a little plumbers butt if you want. Excuse me. <br/>It's annoying as hell, but I'm going to do my best to be nice to him right  now so he can get a good impression of our get a good impression of our camp. camp. <br/>16 years old. <br/>Really? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think Todd's a real cool guy. He wants to play the game, and I've got a pretty good hunch. For whatever it's worth, I For whatever it's worth, I believe I can trust him. believe I can trust him. <br/>I do. <br/>That's pretty good. Let's sit down right here. Let's sit down right here. Here you go, bro. Here you go, bro. Read it and hide it somewhere up in the grass or something up in the grass or  something like that. like that. <br/>Deal. <br/>Deal. <br/>Thank you, man. <br/>Sweet. <br/>Appreciate it. <br/>Cool, man. <br/>I trust Todd because I asked a key question of him-- "Do you believe  turnabout's fair play?"-- because the next one we win, I can only assume  we'll be kidnapping somebody, and he'll probably get the same thing. So we kind of have a little bit of a loose alliance from tribe of a loose  alliance from tribe to tribe going on. to tribe going on. <br/>I feel very lucky right now that Leslie not only gave me the clue to the  first one, but Dave gave me the next two. So I've been keeping my eyes open, looking for something that could be the  hidden immunity idol, because that could be the ticket to a could be the  ticket to a million dollars. million dollars. <br/>You ready? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Want me to carry it? <br/>Want me to carry it? <br/>Want me to carry it? <br/>Kissing all the girls. <br/>Kissing all the girls. <br/>I wonder how the other tribe is starting to feel about him. I was very happy they took Dave. Glad to get him out of my hair for a couple of days. We haven't had any of that conflict going on, so my mood today is actually a  lot more relaxed. It's nice not to have him around. <br/>We need to boil water for drinking first. <br/>You guys want to do quick  You guys want to do quick firewood gathering. firewood gathering. <br/>Dave was really just a workhorse, as far as whatever needed to be done that  nobody else wanted to do. And that really helped us. And now we're going to have to And now we're going to have to pick up that  slack. pick up that slack. <br/>Without Dave, we're scrounging around, trying to get everything done. I don't know, I'm getting frustrated because I'm just tired and I feel like  some people are trying to get away people are trying to get away with not  helping out. with not helping out. <br/>Sweet! <br/>Frosti got it! <br/>Nice! <br/>Everybody has been running around sweating, trying to do 10 million projects,  and I feel like why even waste energy on something that is going to just  drain you. I'm trying to conserve my energy for the challenges. So if they want to keep working, that's okay with me. I'm going to ride the workhorse until the tails fall off, because I'm not  doing anything because I'm not doing anything until I have to. until I have to. <br/>Fishing boats! <br/>They're coming, you guys! <br/>Hi! <br/>Hi! <br/>Oh! Our reward today, we had a fisherman family come with their boat, and they  are going to cook us a meal, and also teach some us a meal, and also teach  some of us how to fish. of us how to fish. of us how to fish. <br/>They said a family. <br/>They said a family. <br/>This is the best reward that we've ever had. The fisherman came, the family came. I am so grateful for them to be here today. Their children are so pretty. Everybody is so nice. <br/>Peppers! <br/>We've got eggs! <br/>Catfish! <br/>They came with huge fish, vegetables. They came with oils and spices. <br/>Oh, my God! I never thought I would miss vegetables so much in my life, but they look  absolutely but they look absolutely terrific. terrific. <br/>When I was a little kid, I spent a few years in Taiwan, and I learned some  Mandarin and I learned some Mandarin over there. over there. over there. <br/>They can only take two out. <br/>They can only take two out. <br/>Jean-Robert is full of surprises. He goes off and starts talking to these people, and it was fantastic because  they were able to communicate with each other, and he knew what they wanted. <br/>Aaron, he's going to tell you guys what to do. <br/>It's been 20 years since I've used Mandarin, but honestly, when that family  came, all of a sudden, just words and everything started coming back to me. I didn't even know I still had I didn't even know I still had it. it. <br/>Denise and I went off in the fisherman's boat, and it was absolutely the most  bizarre absolutely the most bizarre thing I've ever seen. thing I've ever seen. Oh, they're going to go catch the fish that we're going to fish with. fish with. And then they can't swallow it. And then they can't swallow it. <br/>It was incredible! I thought we were going to eat the birds when they showed up, and they had  them all tied to the boat. But they're fishing birds. They had them all trained. They could swoop down, pick up They could swoop down, pick up the fish. the fish. The bird will regurgitate the fish right out of his mouth in the bottom of  the boat. And, I mean, he was picking up pretty good-sized fish out pretty good-sized  fish out there. there. <br/>Be careful inside when you're pulling this out, because there pulling this  out, because there are teeth that could cut you. are teeth that could cut you. She needs a fire. She needs a fire. Fire. Fire. <br/>Dude, I'm just saying... I'm translating what she's saying. That's not giving orders. <br/>Jean-Robert, he got up on his high horse as he usually do, kind of got on  everybody's nerves-- really mine. <br/>I said she's asking for  I said she's asking for a fire. a fire. <br/>He was just sitting there being Jean-Robert, but we needed him. He was like the language[1]barrier  guy. He came through. I really couldn't fault him. I really couldn't fault him. He did good. He did good. <br/>The fisherman showed us how to open the net, and then he stretched it out  across the lake so when the fish come they just swim right into the net. Before, we didn't even know how to use the net. But now we're going to have fish. fish. It's going to be great. It's going to be great. <br/>Ahoy. <br/>Hi. <br/>Hi. <br/>Ahoy, matey. <br/>Ahoy, matey. <br/>Ahoy, matey. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>You guys know what "hao chi" means? means? "Hao" is good, and "chi" is eat. "Hao" is good, and "chi" is eat. <br/>I've never been so happy in my life. <br/>Oh, my God, after being out here all this time, flavor has never tasted so  good. Oh, my God! That's spicy! You know, a lunch lady is not an expert on food, because you know what we do? We take the chicken nuggets out of the freezer, we put them in the oven, we  give them to the kids. There's nothing good about that. But this stuff here, that was the delicatest thing that I've ever put in my  mouth. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you so much. <br/>This reward was key for us. It's not only that we get a meal but it's a cultural learning experience, and  I really do think that we're going to be eating better, and definitely have  an advantage in the challenges to come. <br/>Bye-bye! <br/>Bye-bye! <br/>Bye-bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. So, Dave, time to rejoin Zhan Hu. <br/>Hi, guys. Good to see you. <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Probst: First things first-- immunity coming back. <br/>See you soon, buddy. <br/>Probst: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. Here's how the challenge is going to play out: for your own protection, you  will each be dressed in traditional Chinese armor. You'll square off in our gladiator arena. Behind each tribe, there are porcelain vases. You will throw meteor hammers, attempting to smash the other tribe's vases  while blocking your opponent's throws with a bamboo pole. We'll go in rounds. First round will be two women on a team, then two men, then one man, one  woman. The tribe that breaks the most vases in those three rounds wins immunity,  safe at least another day here in China. Losers go to tribal council tonight, somebody going home. Fei Long, you have one more member. You're sitting somebody out. Cannot sit out the same people in back-to-back challenges. Courtney sat out the last challenge. She'll be participating in this.

Can she do it again? <br/>Come on, Jaime! <br/>Probst: Jaime launches. No, Jaime and Erik can't do it. Fei Long wins immunity! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Good job, guys. <br/>Good job, guys. Good job, guys. Good job, guys. <br/>Probst: Fei Long, congratulations. Immunity once again. Immunity once again. [applause] [applause] Nobody going home from Fei Long. Zhan Hu, tribal council tonight. One of the six of you will be voted out. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. camp. See you at tribal. See you at tribal. <br/>It was. It was hard. <br/>Maybe we should eat first,  Maybe we should eat first, let our food digest. let our food digest. <br/>You want to dump that out so  You want to dump that out so I can get well water for that? I can get well water for that? <br/>Well, I mean, considering parasites and stuff, I'd like to use a lot less  lake water as possible. possible. You know what I mean? You know what I mean? <br/>Infinitely better just using straight well water. In fact, I'll run and get some, if you want. <br/>I don't care. <br/>I don't care, either. <br/>It feels very strange to be back here at Zhan Hu. We lost the immunity challenge today, and I don't want to go home. But there's very strange vibes going on. Maybe it was just the day and a half away from me, or, you know, my  slave-driving ability. But, I don't know, I'm feeling But, I don't know, I'm feeling very precarious  right now. very precarious right now. <br/>Today, we have to decide who to vote off. It's probably going to be between Sherea and Dave. It's a tough decision because, Sherea, she doesn't really help out as much as  the rest of us do on camp. On the other hand, Dave's just really annoying and really hard really  annoying and really hard to live with. to live with. <br/>She's like, "I'm so tired. I'm weak. I need to save my energy for challenges" and just kind of got into that  mode. "Hey, everybody's cool with me laying around and not doing me laying  around and not doing much of anything." much of anything."  They all decided to go take a dip in the lake. And of course, when voices get low, you know something's going on. I am concerned that me not doing as much around camp is affecting everybody  else's opinion. So, I already know that my name So, I already know that my name may be  written down tonight. may be written down tonight. People just looking at people around camp, or people looking at people in  challenges. You know what I'm saying? You never know what people are thinking. <br/>But we do have to make these judgments so quick. <br/>Everybody pulls their weight in different ways. I mean, yeah, I don't do everything around camp, but I get to a challenge,  I'm going to bust my ass to make sure we win. Everybody busting their butts the first few days and everybody else is  getting, like, fatigued. like, fatigued. My body comes first, you know. My body comes first, you know. <br/>It's really close toss-up between Sherea's not working and Dave's kind of  making everybody crazy. It's just been back and forth in my mind. I think if it were up to me, you know, if we could get rid of both of them,  it would be of both of them, it would be great. great. <br/>Probst: Sherea, how did the tribe dynamic change having Dave gone for a day? <br/>We were able to go ahead and move on and get things going the same way we  would if he was there. We had some relaxing time and some chill time, but we still kept busy and got  things done when he was gone. <br/>Probst: Frosti, is that a credit to Dave for establishing maybe a work ethic  that keeps on even when he's gone? <br/>It can definitely be seen as a credit to Dave's name. I mean, he got us going on making sure we had water boiling at all times. We got food done, and even without him there, we accomplished a lot, so...  Probst: Erik, you were nodding your head. <br/>I like Dave. And, honestly, there's been some disagreements, and it frustrates me seeing  other people not kind of receiving Dave's leadership. You know, Dave has great leadership qualities. It's just his natural personality. <br/>Probst: Dave, would it be a bit of a relief to go back to camp and not have  to lead tonight? <br/>Absolutely. It's been quite a burden. It's been something I didn't want to begin with. I just happen to have more experience and more practical ideas, and that's  how we got where we are today. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about camp life. You've been out here 12 days now. Sherea, everybody still pulling their own weight? <br/>Definitely, everybody's doing something. I'm stepping it up a lot more. <br/>Probst: From what to what? <br/>I've been very fatigued, and, just, my body hasn't been in it when I'm  around, you know, the camp area, so the last few days, I've been trying to do  more. But if we don't save our energy for challenges, we'll never get further ahead  in the game. <br/>Probst: Dave, is camp life more important than challenge participation, or  should you sacrifice at camp to make sure you have a shot at winning? <br/>Saving just for challenges is a short-term goal, because if you are not fed,  if you are not rested and hydrated, it will just take its toll. <br/>Probst: Peih-gee, if given the choice between somebody pulling their weight  back at camp or being invincible at challenges? <br/>You know, honestly, I know you want me to pick one, but you can't. You need to have a balance between the two, and if you don't, it's going to  put an undue burden on the rest of the tribe. <br/>She enjoys camp life. I live for the challenges. She loves to be out here in this environment. <br/>I love the challenges, too. <br/>I know, but I'm just saying that's why you can say both. She's always like, "Yeah, I love it out here! This is easy for me." And I'm like, "This is not easy for me,"  you know. But the challenges, I live for those. That's what keeps me going every day. <br/>Probst: Once again, you guys are in a position of trying to adjust tribe  dynamics, and you're going to do it by getting rid of somebody. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Erik, you're up. Erik, you're up. Erik, you're up. I'll go tally the votes. I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote, Dave. First vote, Dave. Sherea. One vote Dave, one vote Sherea. Dave. Two votes Dave, one vote Sherea. Dave. Three votes Dave, one vote Sherea. Fourth person voted out of Survivor: China,Dave. That's four, it's enough. You need to bring me your You need to bring me your torch. torch. torch. Dave, the tribe has spoken. Dave, the tribe has spoken. Dave, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. <br/>Probst: Well, it's clear from tonight's vote that you weren't happy with the  way things were going at camp. I hope that means there's a new plan in place. Because you're going to need one. You're now two members down. Grab your torches, head back to camp. camp. Good night. Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor: Survivor:  I like you a lot. <br/>I like you a lot. <br/>Probst: Jaime and Erik explore new territory. <br/>I don't know what's going to happen with Jaime and I. I'm a virgin. <br/>Probst: And a twist...  Something's going on. <br/>Probst: ...turns the game on its head. <br/>Oh, the humanity.

At least I did it with conviction and integrity. I thought I was humble. And I thought I listened. I wish that some people perhaps listened to me a little bit more.
