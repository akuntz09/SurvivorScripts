<br/> <br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor: On day one, James and  Parvati and Amanda and Ozzy joined together to form a powerful alliance. And  later, Ozzy found the hidden immunity idol... ...and replaced it with a fake  one as a decoy, which was discovered by Jason.  <br/>I guess this is the hidden immunity idol.  <br/>Jeff: Having the idol put Ozzy and his alliance in control  of the game.  <br/>It's in our little four clique. And I think it's supposed  to be in our little four clique.  <br/>Jeff: But their control was short-lived. Drop your buffs,  we are switching tribes. A tribe switch blurred the line between fans and  favorites. At the new Airai, Parvati formed a side alliance with Natalie and  Alexis.  <br/>I hope Amanda will be down for that when I get back with  her.  <br/>Jeff: At Malakal, Ami told the fans that she would join  with them in voting out Ozzy.  <br/>I'm giving all my trust to you right now.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Take care of me. Take care of me, okay, you guys? Please,  because I'm really sticking my neck out there, you guys.  <br/>Jeff: But Erik ratted her out.  <br/>Did Ami try and get me out?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Ami desperately tried to defend  herself.  <br/>I want to be here. I swear, I'll give you everything I  have.  <br/>Jeff: In the end, the favorites didn't believe her, and  Ami was voted out. Eighth person voted out of Survivor: Fans Versus  Favorites,Ami. And for the first time a fan stayed while a favorite went  home.  <br/>Good luck, you guys.  <br/>Jeff: Ten are left.  <br/>Jeff: Ten are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who  will be voted out tonight?  <br/>Fire, come on. You're killing me. Oh, god.  <br/>I felt bad. It was just, like, I couldn't believe what she  was saying.  <br/>The thing was, she dug her own grave.  <br/>Here you go.  <br/>Tonight at tribal council was hard. I would have never  voted for Ami ever if she had just been honest with me, and that's... that's  a key in this game. You can't be playing all the sides like that. If she had  just stuck with me, she'd still be in this game, and Erik would be  gone.  <br/>I don't understand how she didn't feel part of our  group.  <br/>How the hell am I still here today? I have no idea. I feel  like I'm in this house that keeps falling down and somehow I'm, like, making  my way through it as it's breaking apart.  <br/>Oh, my god.  <br/>This was the first time the favorites have kept a fan and  voted out one of their own. voted out one of their own. It feels insane. It  feels insane.  <br/>This tribal council tonight set a definite precedent on  fans versus favorites in this game. It's kind of like all bets are off. It's  kind of every man for It's kind of every man for themselves at this point.  themselves at this point.

I mean, really pissed them off. Strangely enough, I think my  closest ally at this point is Jason, because we're both kind of on the outs  with our tribe. We both also love this game, and I think we both annoy  people. I'm not going to lie. I think that that kind of unites I think that  that kind of unites us, too. us, too.  <br/>Oh, my god. Jason told me that he had the hidden immunity  idol. I mean, oh, my god. It's just crazy. That puts you in a really good  position. Jason having the hidden immunity idol means that it's a good  alliance for me to have, and hopefully we can take it to the hopefully we can  take it to the end. end.  <br/>And there is tree mail. "Malakal, check all of your  personal and tribal possessions that you may need to survive for the duration  of this game, and make your way to the location designated on the map  immediately. You will receive instructions when you get there."  <br/>Oh, my god.  <br/>We're leaving our beach?  <br/>We're leaving.  <br/>We're merging.  <br/>Yeah, I think we're merging.  <br/>"Immediately" means right now.  <br/>Oh, all right, all right.  <br/>A merge would be highly beneficial for me because I would  think I would have more of a shot at this game, because there's more players  now on the board to choose from as opposed to Malakal, which is now four, and  those odds aren't very good and those odds aren't very good to survive. to  survive. And if you want to bring somebody in or if I want to bring somebody  in, I'll tell you and Amanda before anything goes.  <br/>Cool.  <br/>I owe it to you guys 100%.  <br/>Cool, thank you. And I'll be straight up with you the  whole time.  <br/>That's fine. One thing that did come out of last night is  rather than being in opposition to Ozzy, one of the most powerful players in  the game, I'm now allied with him in some kind of, like, zookeeper bond.  Like, I'm more the monkey and he's the zookeeper now, because I owe him my  life now. It makes total sense. Just play it straight up with somebody that  you know. somebody that you know.  <br/>Yeah, exactly.  <br/>Yeah, exactly.  <br/>"Airai, make your way to the location designated on  the map immediately." [ cheers] [ cheers]  <br/>Get the heck off this island.  <br/>Get the heck off this island. And I would not [ no audio]  you all over. And if we can rely on the four of us, that would be rad.  <br/>Oh my god, I am in such a hot pickle right now. I have  made an alliance with my original tribe of Ozzy, James, Cirie, and Amanda.  And the second alliance that I got myself into is me, Alexis, Natalie, and  Amanda. So I feel like I have the numbers on my side no matter what, but I'm  going to have a decision to make, you know, down the road.  <br/>Off to the races, my ladies, off to the races.  <br/>Oh, yippee! The game has really begun, I feel like. If  Parvati feels more of an alliance to her original group, then Natalie and I  will be out, and, you know, that's the game. But I think right now we're  certainly banking on the fact that it's not really fans and that it's not  really fans and favorites anymore. favorites anymore. [ cheers]  <br/>Oh, my god! [ cheers]  <br/>Glad to see you.  <br/>Your hair is so fresh.  <br/>Your hair is so fresh.  <br/>Hey, baby.  <br/>Hey, baby.  <br/>This is the worst merge I could possibly imagine. I was  really expecting to see that Erik was voted out, and instead it was Ami, who  was probably my closest ally and closest friend in this game. And so I feel  really alone right now, and I'm heartbroken that she's not here.  <br/>Let's eat!  <br/>Let's eat!  <br/>But I'm trying to stay positive and act like I'm having  fun and try and fit in with the group.  <br/>"Tribes, today is cause for celebration. You are  merged. You will spend the night here to eat, drink, and embrace your new  tribe." [ cheers] "You must decide on a new tribe name, paint your  new tribe flag, and decide on which of your former tribe beaches you wish to  live."  <br/>We're all merged, and we have to decide what camp to go  to. No question, Malakal, all the way. We have everything you need. I'm kind  of mad we had to take everything down and we're just going back, but, I mean,  I'm so glad we're going back.  <br/>They're bats?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>What?  <br/>Bats.  <br/>I didn't know what was going on. There was a bowl of bat  in the middle of our table. And James, of course, James, reaches in and grabs  a bat and throws it on his plate and just starts chowing down on this bat. I  guess it's a Micronesian thing. I don't know.  <br/>Oh, James, it's, like wet. You have, like, wet bat in your  hand right now.  <br/>I mean, how often do you get a chance to eat a bat? It's  one of the things you have to try, and it was good. It was like a juicy  rabbit. So, I mean, I'm going to probably eat another one.  <br/>I was thinking of a tribe name. Like, the name for good  here is Dabu. So we can do Dabu.  <br/>Dabu. I like Dabu.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Cheers!  <br/>Our new tribe.  <br/>Good times. With Gabu? Or Dabu?  <br/>An experience that we're never going to forget.  <br/>I told everybody Dabu means good in Micronesian, but  really I pretty much just made it up. I love that everyone thinks, like,  "Oh, Erik looked up Micronesian." Hell, no, I didn't look up  Micronesian. I just wanted to name the tribe something funny. For all I care  it could have been "Momo," or, like, "Fosshizzle," or  something. I don't know. I like Dabu.  <br/>I like Dabu, too.  <br/>Does everyone want to agree that, like, let's enjoy this,  and then, you know, then we're back to the game? But take time, just,  "Boom."  <br/>Talk, get to know each other.  <br/>I would like that.  <br/>When you merge two tribes, all of a sudden, it becomes a  much more interpersonal game. Your alliances become very fuzzy, because at  this point it's ten individual people that you now have to survive another 17  days with, and it kind of becomes more who do you get becomes more who do you  get along with. along with.  <br/>I flipped out. I was like, "Oh, my god." I was  so happy.  <br/>It was basically my doing. I'm ready to go beyond fans  versus favorites.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I'm ready to look past that whole thing and really  understand that... that, yeah. I mean, I like you a lot.  <br/>You know, I had a great time with Ozzy out on Exile, and I  am a fan, you know. So I was just kind of excited to come out here and get to  know him. And I felt like it was very genuine from both sides.  <br/>I think that you really do deserve to be here, and I would  rather have you here than rather have you here than somebody else. somebody  else.  <br/>Yeah, right.  <br/>I know Alexis likes Ozzy, but me and Ozzy have been doing  this together for 22 days now, and she just comes in and makes herself all  comfortable, and, yeah, it bothers me a little bit. I want her gone. I want  her gone.  <br/>Wow!  <br/>Wow!  <br/>What are you up to?  <br/>Whatever.  <br/>Good to be back.  <br/>Good to be here.  <br/>Oh, my god. The Malakal beach. Heaven.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Look how scenic this is. I feel like I'm in the land of  milk and honey over here, because they have this huge open space where they  have their day shelter, and they have a huge cave where, like, people can  hang out if it rains. It's ridiculous how nice it is here. here.  <br/>A little siesta in the shade.  <br/>A little siesta in the shade.  <br/>It's going to be a little hard getting used to seeing  these new folks just grabbing stuff and picking. It's like people coming into  your house and picking up the remote and turning the channel. I mean,  granted, we're all one happy team now, so we'll all just have to get  along.  <br/>Cool.  <br/>You guys got a spear, too?  <br/>Yeah, we've got two.  <br/>Nice.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Flippers?  <br/>Actually, I've been waiting all game for you to teach  me.  <br/>Flippers, too?  <br/>No, but, I mean, I'm a good diver.  <br/>Jason is a big fan of mine, but he probably believes that  he can do it all better, and he probably wants to prove himself to me or to  the world. And he's going to prove himself or he's not. But going to Exile, I  found out someone has taken my planted idol. Most likely, it's Jason. To me,  I think he's the only one who would have had the opportunity to look who  hasn't been voted out. So I think that Jason walking around with my fake  hidden immunity idol is a beautiful thing. I think it's poetry in the I think  it's poetry in the making. making.  <br/>I brought the hidden immunity idol with me from Airai. So  right now I'm kind of just walking around, scoping out areas where I think,  you know, I might hide it. The sooner I can get it out of my bag, the more  comfortable I'll feel. Hopefully, you know, nobody will discover it here. I'm  just going to try to tuck it up in this rock here real nice, so that, you  know, nobody's walking by... so that when somebody is walk by, they won't see  it. So I'm going to... you know, hopefully I won't forget this hopefully I  won't forget this spot either. spot either.  <br/>What happened?  <br/>With Ami?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Did you ask Amanda or anyone?  <br/>Yeah, she said Ami was trying to vote Ozzy out. to vote  Ozzy out.  <br/>Yep.  <br/>Yep.  <br/>Well, you know, regardless of what happened with her, that  you guys have my loyalty 100%. You know that, right? You know that,  right?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I mean, I guess she just thought, you know, she could  thought, you know, she could save herself. save herself.  <br/>The old Malakal?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>I mean I don't know.  <br/>I mean I don't know.  <br/>I know, but things have changed, and it's, like, a whole  different game, you know?  <br/>Now that the two tribes have merged, it's an individual  game. Ami's gone and I feel outnumbered, and I feel on the outs. I don't feel  like I have any real close allies, except for Jason. I mean, if I at least  got in with the favorites, then it would be, "Okay, I can get my way to  the final six and then work from there." But if I'm not even in with  them, I could be next to go. I mean, this is just... this is a disaster.  <br/>I don't know what's going on yet, honestly. I'm not going  to lie to you.  <br/>Okay. I appreciate that.  <br/>With the merge, it's not fans versus favorites anymore, I  don't think.  <br/>I hope you'll keep me in the loop.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Of course, Eliza is always trying to scramble something  together because she's always on the outside. And I think it's hilarious that  she's still trying to come up to me and tell me that she's loyal, and 100%  true to the end. Like, how can anyone be so Like, how can anyone be so  ridiculous? ridiculous? I have missed you so much.  <br/>Oh, my god.  <br/>You don't know how long I've been dying to just have this  conversation with you, because I'm like, "I just want her to know  everything that's going on."  <br/>Eliza's staring at us. She's always staring at us. She's  over there staring at us. I can't have her here anymore.  <br/>I'm so sick of her.  <br/>She's going next.  <br/>She's going next. She has to. She has to.  <br/>And they're like... they're like, "Yeah, but, honestly...  "Well, me and Amanda are really tight, and it's pretty much  unbreakable." it's pretty much unbreakable." And they understand.  And they understand. I've put us in an alliance without you being there. But  at least the game's revolving around us, which is good. But we're in such a  mess because these people are voting in the end for who gets the  million.  <br/>I know.  <br/>And if we [ bleep] them over...  <br/>Well, it's inevitable now. Parvati pretty much screwed me  over, because I don't want to be in an alliance with Natalie and Alexis. I  don't want to go up against Alexis at the end. She's a motivational speaker,  for crying out loud. Well, well, well.  <br/>Yeah, so here's our pickle, and we're in it. Now I might  as well go make an alliance with Erik, Jason, and Eliza right now, a triple  pickle.  <br/>Might as well.  <br/>I mean, I giggled about it to her, but it's not  funny.  <br/>Everybody's on the same page about Eliza.  <br/>I'm livid, and it leaves me with a lot of questions about  with a lot of questions about Parvati. Parvati.  <br/>Tree mail.  <br/>Tree mail.  <br/>"If you feel you're in over your head...  <br/>...and you're worried about being voted out...  <br/>...the only way to guarantee you're safe is to be the last  one to bail out."  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Endurance.  <br/>It's bailing water or something.  <br/>Maybe it's as the tide comes in.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>You start to drown?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I'd say that Eliza and myself are definitely still on the  outskirts of any kind of alliances in the new Dabu tribe, but the hidden  immunity idol is definitely my biggest bargaining chip. If I can win the  individual immunity challenge, it will, you know, allow me to give away the  hidden immunity idol. Because if I have the immunity necklace, the votes are  going to be cast toward someone else like be cast toward someone else like  Eliza. Eliza.  <br/>...I'd give it to you. So think about that.  <br/>Okay, I'll think about it. Jason pulls me aside and it's  like, "Oh, by the way, if I can win the individual immunity challenge,  the hidden immunity idol, I'll give it to you." Who would have guessed?  I made an alliance with the right person who was sent to Exile one too many  times. So I'm in good spirits today. Then whoever Jason and I vote for, even  if everyone else votes for, even if everyone else votes for me, will go home.  for me, will go home. for me, will go home.  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! Alexis, you came up with a new  tribe name?  <br/>Yeah, Dabu is our name. It is Micronesian for good. And it  was Erik's suggestion, and it was awesome. It fit perfectly.  <br/>Jeff: All right, you guys ready to get it your first  individual immunity challenge?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: First things first.  <br/>Jeff: First things first. Who's got the idol? Who's got  the idol? Tribal immunity is no more. This is now what you covet-- individual  immunity. This now becomes the single most important thing in this game. Have  this around your neck, you are safe in this game. Without it, you are most  definitely vulnerable. Today's challenge is going to test your ability to  remain calm when everything else in your body urges you to do otherwise.  You're each going to take a spot in the water underneath a grated steel  barrier. As the tide rises, the water will rise. As the water rises, your  breathing space will decrease until you have nowhere left to breathe. Your  head must stay completely under the grate at all times. The person who stays  in this challenge the longest wins immunity, is guaranteed a one in nine shot  at a million bucks. I'll give you a minute to strategize. strategize. We'll  get started. We'll get started.  <br/>Jeff: All right, here we go.  <br/>Let's rock 'n' roll.  <br/>Jeff: For individual immunity. Survivors ready?  <br/>Ready.  <br/>Jeff: Go.  <br/>Jeff: Go. This challenge is on. This challenge is on. [  laughter]  <br/>Cirie, has the panic set in yet?  <br/>Not quite yet.  <br/>Not quite yet.  <br/>Give me, like, five minutes.  <br/>Give me, like, five minutes. Help me. Help me.  <br/>Jeff: Now it's going to start to get interesting. That  water level starts to creep up, starts covering your ears. You can't hear  anymore. It's going to mean trouble for people who panic. Amanda is the first  out. Head popped up behind the grate. You can take a spot on the You can take  a spot on the pontoon, Amanda. pontoon, Amanda. What happened, Amanda? You  just weren't paying attention?  <br/>No, I was, like, relaxed and dozing, and I thought I had  more dozing, and I thought I had more space above me than I did. space above  me than I did.  <br/>Jeff: The water continues to rise. It's starting to work  its way up your face. Now it's getting close to the eyes. Your brain is going  to tell you to bail and get out of this. Just mind over matter. Remind  yourself, you can always take one last deep breath. Parvati has had enough.  She opts out. Alexis opts out right behind Parvati. Amanda, Parvati, and  Alexis the Amanda, Parvati, and Alexis the first three out. first three out.  Cirie has had enough. Can't take it any longer. Can't take it any longer.

You have to have your nose and mouth  through that grate, or you will be underwater. Amazing. All three of these  guys still in it.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: This is going to be a true test of who wants  immunity true test of who wants immunity the most. the most.  <br/>This is, like, painful.  <br/>It's painful to watch.  <br/>Jeff: James can't do it any longer. James is out. We are  now down to Jason and We are now down to Jason and Ozzy. Ozzy. Ozzy.  <br/>Come out, Oz.  <br/>Come out, Oz.  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy really struggling,  <br/>Jeff: Ozzy really struggling, but he is back up. but he is  back up. Ozzy comes up. It's over.

Individual immunity. Safe at tribal council tonight. For the other nine  of you, not the case. Somebody going home. You have the afternoon to figure  out who it's going to be. out who it's going to be. See you at tribal. See  you at tribal.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>I know, awesome, good job.  <br/>Quite exciting getting to beat Ozzy. My, quote, like,  favorite player in the game, you know, watching him dominate in so many  challenges, and then...  <br/>Beating him.  <br/>Yep.  <br/>Knowing if you weren't there, he would have won that  one.  <br/>Yep. Today's immunity challenge I was able to win. In  fact, I think I actually dominated the whole challenge. When I came up and  saw the look of failure on Ozzy's face, it was pretty delightful. So being  able to dominate Ozzy and then hopefully being able to send him home later  tonight will be one of the highlights of the be one of the highlights of the  game for me. game for me.  <br/>Are you kidding?  <br/>No. Just... I'm always, like... feel like I'm always out  of the loop.  <br/>You're definitely in the  <br/>You're definitely in the loop. loop.  <br/>Eliza has been my biggest rival, I think, since the  beginning of this game. She's been running around trying to get me voted out  personally since day one. I mean, everyone on this tribe is voting for her  tonight, as far as I know. I wouldn't have trusted her, but if she would have  tried to work with me on the other side, it would have been easier. But she  was trying to get me out the whole time, and then she comes up to me and  tries to be loyal. I'm like, "Too little, too late, I'm like, "Too  little, too late, lady." lady."  <br/>Jason. I'm pretty sure they're voting for me, so...  <br/>I've got you covered. Don't worry.  <br/>So we're voting Ozzy?  <br/>So we're voting Ozzy?  <br/>Yes.  <br/>Yes.  <br/>You hid it?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Are you going to get it?  <br/>Yeah!  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Don't worry, baby.  <br/>Okay. I'm trusting you.  <br/>I'll go get it right now.  <br/>Okay. My god. It will literally be the biggest blindside  in history.  <br/>I can't wait to send Ozzy's cocky ass home tonight. He's  going to be like "What?"  <br/>This might make me more hated than Fairplay. Oh, my god!  I'm so glad you won today.  <br/>I could have been down there  <br/>I could have been down there another ten minutes. another  ten minutes.  <br/>What's Ozzy and Alexis talking about?  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>All of a sudden this set comes in and, boom, just hammers  me and brings me back on the inside.  <br/>Alexis is dangerous-- very, very, very, very  dangerous.  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>And she needs to go.  <br/>I'm cool with that. I mean...  <br/>First. She needs to go now. I don't think I know Ozzy as  well as I think I know him.  <br/>I keep trying to tell you, missy, he's playing.  <br/>Well, I'm playing, too.  <br/>I know. Amanda seems to believe that we should probably  get rid of Alexis, and I think a small bit of jealousy is coming into play  because of the relationship that Ozzy has with Alexis. Will he vote  her?  <br/>Yeah. I don't... I think so.  <br/>But as long as it's not me,  <br/>But as long as it's not me, then I'll vote Alexis. then  I'll vote Alexis. then I'll vote Alexis.  <br/>It's in my bag.  <br/>It's in my bag.  <br/>This is so stupid. This is just a napkin. Oh, my god. Oh,  my god. This isn't it. This isn't it. Jason, come here. What are you doing?  What are you trying to pull? I'm going home anyhow. It's not the idol.  <br/>It is the idol.  <br/>It's not the idol.  <br/>Yes, it is.  <br/>Ozzy must have put it in there. He must have the real  thing. That's not the idol.  <br/>What is it?  <br/>It's a [ no audio] stick.  <br/>I know. It has a face on it. Don't worry.  <br/>Ozzy put it in there and made a face on it.  <br/>No, he didn't.  <br/>It's not the idol.  <br/>Why do you say that?  <br/>Because that can't be the idol.  <br/>Why not?  <br/>Because it's just a stick.  <br/>I know. Do you think so?  <br/>I think that that's not the idol. idol.  <br/>Then that's a bummer.  <br/>Then that's a bummer.  <br/>Then that's a bummer.  <br/>Yeah, of course.  <br/>Yeah, of course.  <br/>Jeff: Alexis, one of the things that happens when you  merge is it's the first time everybody's together, all at once. Gives you the  opportunity to start assessing skills. How much time have you spent looking  at people that are now new to you thinking, "This is how they're  playing"?  <br/>I think there are three main points that define strength  in this game. You know, are they a stronger social player? Are they a stronger  physical player? Are they a stronger mental player? So I think the merge is  the first opportunity where you really get to see your entire competition  versus the competition within your own tribe.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie, Alexis brings up three different types of  skills. What skills do you see that Alexis has?  <br/>So far, I'd say Alexis has all three. Socially around  camp, physically during the challenges, and she's mentally strong. So I think  she's, like, a triple threat. Sorry.  <br/>Jeff: Alexis, is that a little worrisome to be outed as a  triple threat?  <br/>I don't think at this point in the game. I mean, there's  ten people left out of 20, so I think there are several people here left who  maintain a triple threat. I don't think you make it this far if you're not  mentally, physically, socially competitive.  <br/>Jeff: You talk about your skill list. Tell me about  Eliza's skills.  <br/>I think that Eliza played an incredible physical and  mental game. I don't think she played as well a social game.  <br/>Jeff: You say "Played."  <br/>Pardon me?  <br/>You said it in past tense, as if I've already been voted  out.  <br/>Okay, I'm sorry.  <br/>It's okay.  <br/>Jeff: Eliza, do you agree with that? Are you strong and  weak as she says?  <br/>Alexis' assessment was probably right on. I think that my  social game potentially has been lacking. But I think that a lot of people  here are playing a very shortsighted game, and not really looking down the  line. So they're overestimating their own social game, I think.  <br/>Jeff: So, Ozzy, there's two sides of this social skill.  There's the side that's threatening because the person is very good socially.  The other side is the person is so bad socially that maybe you keep them  around.  <br/>Yeah, you take someone who nobody likes to the end, and  you win.  <br/>That's the way to win Survivor. There's no book to win  Survivor. That's the schedule. Get the one that everybody hates and keep them  along, yeah.  <br/>Jeff: Eliza, you can't miss your eyes when they roll. Do  you think you're liked?  <br/>No, not really.  <br/>She's liked.  <br/>No, I'm not really liked.  <br/>Well, Eliza, you've been running around back and forth  trying to vote me out since day one, then coming back to me yesterday telling  me you're going to be 100% loyal to me, that we need to stay true to the old Malakal  tribe and favorites to the end. Are you kidding me? People are going to  believe you?  <br/>That's not true. Everyone is saying we would stick  together, we would stick together.  <br/>But what were you trying to do to me the first day? What  were you trying to do to me?  <br/>I was not trying to do anything to you.  <br/>I just can't sit here and be quiet anymore, because  it's... it's just too much for me.  <br/>Jeff: Eliza, welcome to tribal council. No free  rides.  <br/>I mean, I definitely got myself into this mess. But  everyone is here to win a million dollars. I mean, you know, people have come  awfully close and lost because they went up against the best. You know, so  it's, like, are you really going to make the same mistake again? I mean,  bring people people don't like to the finals with you, and have a shot, plain  and simple.  <br/>Jeff: All right, it is time to get to the vote. Jason, you  have the individual immunity necklace. If at any time you want to assign it  to someone else, whether at the beach or here at tribal council, you can do  that.  <br/>You know, I feel like I have no alliances at the new Dabu  tribe. I don't think anyone had a conversation with me the entire  afternoon.  <br/>Jeff: So Jason is clearly not going to give up the  necklace. You cannot vote for Jason. Everybody else is fair game. It is time  to vote. It is time to vote. Amanda, you're up. Amanda, you're up.  <br/>I hope something miraculous happens with the stick and happens  with the stick and you're voted out, not me. you're voted out, not me.  <br/>It was your bad luck to pick the wrong girl to mess with.  Hope you learn from your Hope you learn from your mistakes the second time  around. mistakes the second time around.  <br/>Tonight my vote is for Ozzy. Hopefully what I gave Eliza  is the real hidden immunity idol. I can't wait to see the look on I can't  wait to see the look on your face if it is you. your face if it is you.  <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the  <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has the  hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time play it,  now would be the time to do so. to do so. The rules of Survivorstate that if  a hidden immunity idol is played, then any votes cast against that person do  not count, and the person with the next highest number of votes next highest  number of votes would be voted out. would be voted out. This is not a hidden  immunity idol.  <br/>That means Ozzy has it. Jason found it on Exile. Ozzy has  the real one.  <br/>Sorry, I couldn't tell you guys, but...  <br/>But it was worth a shot.  <br/>Jeff, come on.  <br/>Jeff, come on. That took hours to make. That took hours to  make.  <br/>Jeff: Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is  final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote, Eliza.  First vote, Eliza. Ozzy. Ozzy. One vote Eliza, one vote Ozzy. One vote Eliza,  one vote Ozzy. Ozzy. Ozzy. Two votes Ozzy, one vote Eliza.

Time for  you to go.  <br/>Jeff: Well, it would seem this fans versus favorite  competition might indeed be over, and we're left with a group of nine  individuals, all with an equal shot at winning this game. Grab your torches.  Head back to camp. Good night.

Yeah. Yeah. Ozzy with a big lead!  Ozzy with a big lead!  <br/>This game is outwit, outplay... outplay...  <br/>Outlast, yeah.  <br/>Outlast, yeah.  <br/>Well, I think I did everything I could do in this game. I  think I went out with a bang, played a fake hidden immunity idol. I can't  really believe that Jason thought that stick was the real hidden immunity  idol, but I had to play it anyhow, out Ozzy for having the real one, and  hopefully now people can do something about it. Too bad that immunity idol  wasn't real, because we would wasn't real, because we would have shocked  them.
