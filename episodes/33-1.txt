<br/>Jeff: It is one of the most stunning places in the world, Fiji. Crystal-clear water, diverse and dangerous wildlife. And hundreds of breathtaking islands. This will be the battleground for a "Survivor" culture  war. These 20 americans don't know it yet, but they're about to be  divided into two tribes -- the millennials ranging in age from 18 to 31. <br/>My generation, it's all about doing what you want to do,  and I've done a lot. Beekeeper. I brewed beer, snowboard instructor. I've gone the north dakota. I'm definitely a peter pan type. I'll never grow up. This is who I am and I can't change. <br/>I play video games online  for a living, and as an adult, you're constantly told, "Grow up. Stop playing. It's in the a game." but I want to make my entire life  about playing. "Survivor" is the game of games, and I am going to  win. <br/>Young people are always on social media, always on  twitter, but I don't like being tied to my phone. I generally resent technology. I think twiter is the worst thing ever invented. I mean, I’m on twitter, but I still think it's horrendous. <br/>Jeff: Gen-x, range in age from 33 to 52. <br/>I’m an attorney, I’m 38  years old, and I know the older generation, they take and they actually  listen, and they use those life experiences. <br/>If you have ever been knocked down, then you know how to  get up and fight. <br/>I have four kids, and I’m  surprised at the 25-year-old kids that live at home and play video games all  day. And so I just feel like they're a little bit more kay -- kayer  is rawer is raw. Who cares. My parents are paying for it. <br/>It took me 15 years the finally become a writer. I don't think younger people would put that kind of time into  whatever their dream is. They would just try the find a new dream. <br/>Jeff: Two generations with with two very different  approaches to life. They'll be abandoned and left to fend for themselves. They must learn to adapt or they'll be voted out. In the end, only one will remain to claim the $1 million prize. 39 days, 20 people, 1 Survivor. Captioning funded by cbs and ford. We go further, so you can. [ theme song playing]  Jeff: All right. Welcome to the 33rd season of "Survivor." [cheering  and applause] shall we get to it? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Take your name. Don't open it yet. Wait for me. Very exciting time. Which tribe am I going to be on. All right. Everybody open your buffs. Take a spot on your mat. Say hello to your new tribe mates. "Survivor" is on. If you're purple, head to purple. If you're orange, head to orange. Everybody put your buffs on. It's not official until the buff is on the body in some way. <br/>I’m so happy I have this  thing on my head. <br/>Jeff: All right. So once again Survivors mixing things up. This year it is "Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen-x." [applause]  I was like, holy crap,  this is definitely a war between generations. We're at each other's throats right in the beginning. It's crazy. May the best generation win. <br/>Jeff: Gen-x born between 1963 and '82. Millennials born between 1984 and 1997. [cheering] this division goes a lot deeper than just old versus  young. This is two very different philosophical approaches to life, and  what we're going to test this season is which one is better suited to the  game of "Survivor." anybody from the millennials want to own up to  being the one born in '97, the youngest person? No hesitation. What's your name? <br/>Will. <br/>Jeff: Will. 1997. So you're how old? <br/>18. <br/>Jeff: Graduated high school? <br/>No, still in high school. I left high school to play this game. I'm ready to play. <br/>Jeff: That is a first. Our first high school student. <br/>Wow. <br/>Jeff: Now, does anybody on the gen-x tribe want to admit  to being the one born in 1963, making them the oldest? [applause] what's your name? <br/>Paul. <br/>Jeff: Paul. So, Paul, what's it feel like to be in this environment where at  one point gen-x was the generation that was tearing down the walls and  rebuilding the culture. Now you're the oldest guy out here, and here come the heir  apparents. <br/>In our generation, we didn't always get a trophy. In our generation, only the winners got a trophy. You had to go through without an ipod and an app for this and an  app for that. You actually had to walk to the store an get milk. It didn't come in a drone. <br/>Jeff: Woman in the front, what's your name? <br/>Siesta key. <br/>Jeff: CeCe, you were noting a lot. <br/>Yes, everything is handed to them. We had to work for what we got. <br/>Jeff: You in the middle, what's your name? <br/>Adam. <br/>Jeff: All right. Adam, so you hear that, that's the rap on millennials,  participation trophies, we don't want to work. Ring true to you? <br/>I don't think so. I think when we win the first immunity challenge, we'll see who  has to work to win. <br/>Jeff: All right. We'll put you to your first test. Scattered up in this jungle area are items that are going to  help you over the next 39 days. Some of these items will offer short-term value. Other items will offer long-term value. In addition, each tribe has two stations. You'll choose one item from each station. Leave the other one behind. These will be your first big decisions in this game. All right. Are you ready to do this? <br/>Yes! <br/>Jeff: All right. Let's go. <br/>Go, millennials! <br/>Jeff: You've got two minutes to get whatever you can on your  matt. Once it's on your mat, it's yours. <br/>Come on, guys. <br/>Jeff: Gen-x making their first decision, taking the pots  and utensil, leaving the hammer behind. You're making decisions that are going to impact you for the  next 39 days. There is stuff to be found in every nook and cranny. <br/>You need a hammer? <br/>Jeff: The millennials, half of their tribe making one  decision. People already winded. You want everything you can take. There are items in trees. There are items at the base of trees. Don't leave anything behind. <br/>Quick, quick. <br/>On the floor was an envelope. So I just grabbed it and shoved it in my bag and kept going. It's one of those moments where I’m like, oh, my gosh, oh, my  gosh. But my heart was pounding because I was like, that's obviously something  good. <br/>Jeff: Gen-x taking the fishing gear, leaving behind the  chicKens. 30 seconds left. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Jeff: Get what you want and get it on your map. <br/>Adam, let's go. <br/>Jeff: Come back for more if you run out. 15 seconds left. Get it back. This is it. Millennials took the chicKens, leaving the fishing gear. Very big difference out of the gate. Gen-x is looking long term. Millennials are looking short term. Last item? Time! That's it. Drop your items. Head back to your mats. <br/>ChicKens is a good call. <br/>Jeff: Let's just review the big choices. So you guys took the fishing gear. Paul, why fishing gear versus chicKen, which are right there  ready to eat? <br/>Fishing gear is 39 days. Fishing gear was the most important item that we grabbed. <br/>Jeff: Taylor, you guys took chicKens. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Jeff: Why? <br/>Well, they lay eggs, Jeff. <br/>Jeff: All right. Here we go, gen-x, a map to your beach. Millennials, a map to your beach. Before I send you on your way, we are in the cyclone season here  in Fiji. It's been rough. We're in a lull right now, so forecast is for another big storm  to hit soon. This is no hype. It's for real. This season more than any other you need to get to camp and  start working on a shelter, because you are going to need it. Grab your stuff, head out. Good luck. <br/>Millennials versus gen-x. This is a war between generations. I guarantee you that there are people on that gen-x tribe that  have spoKen the exact same words that I have said: This is the best generation  ever. <br/>Walking up the beach and seeing that tribe flag, everybody  is so excited. Everybody is really happy to get to know each other. An we're going the prove a lot of people wrong about their  misconceptions about millennials. <br/>My name is Figgy. My real name is Jessica figueroa. <br/>I’m Mari. I play video games on youk for a living. <br/>As millennials, we're all over the map. No one has just a regular job. I think it's amazing. <br/>I’m Michelle. I'm 28. I work missionary work with a bible group organization. <br/>All right. <br/>I absolutely think that  our tribe and our generation sees things in a completely different way, and  as millennials, that is our huge advantage. <br/>There is a bunch of dead bamboo that needs to be the  bottom layer. <br/>All right. <br/>I've got an awesome tribe. There's one guy I connect with really well in Jay. He's going to be a bro. <br/>A beam across the trees this way. <br/>That's what I was thinking earlier, but...  Aren't you smart. <br/>And then I definitely hit it off with fig because she's  pretty dang cute. <br/>I'll make the fire. <br/>Maybe pocket lint. It lights like that. <br/>That jedi brain. <br/>And also Michelle is cool, and they're both really good  looking. And I am a sucker for pretty girl, so I already have a  connection with these people here. <br/>I am so excited. This is crazy. <br/>I’m just saying, I’m with  a bunch of millennials. I'm a 28 year old. I have never called myself a millennials once in my entire life. I'm not dressed for the youth parade. I'm dressed for the singles mixer at the miami retirement  center. Like I’m an 80-year-old man at heart. This is like cleaning my room back home. Oh, no, where to start, dude. I'm on a tribe with children. When I looked around and I saw all of these kids. I thought, you know what none of these kids have ever had in  their entire lives? A real job. They can't do anything. <br/>Home sweet home, guys. <br/>Great job, everybody. [applause]  Excellent. <br/>I expect gen-xers to be  gen-xers. I expect them to be people of my caliber, people brought up in  my era. They work hard, good, core values with their families, very  strong opinions, but based on sound decision making. <br/>Hey, guys, one second, huh. Being I’m the old guy here, I just wanted to say, the way Jeff  set these tribes up, it changed our odds dramatically, dramatically. It went from being that, wow, I hope it's not to, holy crap, I got  thinkers here and people that know how to build and people...  Our generation, our parents taught us humility, so we  can't underestimate those kids. They're sharp, they're bright. We were working with our hands growing up. They were working with their minds. We can't underestimate them. You underestimate your enemy, you get your ass whooped. <br/>Right. <br/>Real quick, I lived the last five and a half years off the  grid literally in the jungle on maui, so as far as how to set up camp,  knowing the environment, where food is at, let me help with that. To me this is home. I want to help kind of guide my team in the direction I think is  necessary but do so as the guy who is supporting, uplifting and they know  that I've got their back. <br/>Set yourself up for now. <br/>Do you want to do an a-frame shelter? This area is nice. <br/>You guys can get started. Let's get all the debris out into a pile. As it dries, we can also use it for kindling. <br/>When I was running around the grab items, I found  something in a nice little envelope. <br/>We need more bamboo? <br/>Yes. <br/>This is "Survivor." it's a game of any number of  wonderful things. I don't want anyone to find me with it because I feel like that  would then put a target on my back. Would then put a target on my back. <br/>If you are this is the first time in "Survivor"  there is a legacy advantage. If I am still here on day 36, I will receive an advantage in the  game. I will be here on day 36, so no one else is getting this but me. <br/>I want the name one chicKen. <br/>I don't want to name him  after tai because then I can't kill him. <br/>Taylor, are you going to give me a hand with the chicKens? <br/>Back home I’m the center of attention. I am a flirty girl, and I’m good at manipulating men. People think that I’m just a pretty face, but they don't know  the brains behind the face. Maybe I'll end up getting the $1 million check and I'll get a  husband. <br/>There's more stuff we have to get on the beach. <br/>Where is everybody at? I don't like the breakup. I don't like not knowing where everybody is. <br/>Me you and him are pretty good. <br/>I know. <br/>We just need three more. <br/>But I don't plan on losing to old people. Let's have a conversation with us three. Jay and I had a connection right off the back, and Taylor is my  blue-eyed beauty, and I think he's so attractive. <br/>I’m tired, man. My hands are shaking. <br/>And I knew those two boys are tight, so of course I want  to be part of that. It's going to be something strong. <br/>We're invincible. We're like the tri-force. <br/>I love Taylor. He's my boy. I call him tails because he's like my homeboy from home. He's like, bro, the waves are firing, let's go hang out. <br/>We could get Michelle. <br/>Who is Michelle? <br/>Michelle is the one that travels. <br/>Christian. <br/>Yeah, yeah, we got Michelle. <br/>And then Figgy is a cool chick. Tails and Figgy, they're my go-toes. I really appreciate them. And they're good people. <br/>Me and you, for sure. <br/>And then I got namaste, her name is Michelle. I know we're cool. She's a fricKen hot girl, by the way, super hot. <br/>You know what, that's one thing, people say when I slept  like a baby, because I've been around babies, and they don't sleep at all,  man. They sleep like crap. <br/>So looking around, it makes me nervous seeing just like  all the beautiful faces because I don't want to be the obvious first out, but  it's hard when you don't instantly fit in. <br/>Wait. Michelle. Okay. So you do missionary bible things. <br/>Yeah. <br/>That's neat. That's cool. <br/>Essentially I’m a recruiter. <br/>How do you approach them? Bible, here you go. I'm like a jew who knows nothing about the bible. <br/>I think people see me as  truthful, probably because of my faith, so people have been coming up to me,  you know, Jay and I have made a little bond. I've also had Hannah tell me she'll trust me, and in this game,  having people trust you and maybe view you as someone who really does care  for them, that's very beneficial. Who really does care for them, that's very beneficial. <br/>You and me are doing fine. We'll dig it down, and then we can build it up. <br/>How big of a pit do you want to make? <br/>I think we should make  it...  How far down do you want to dig it? <br/>Not that far. <br/>How far is not that far, like...  Six inches. <br/>Six inches. I'm going to get some small pieces...  This is not six inches. We need to keep digging. See, we're in business now. <br/>We are. <br/>You like to play more than work, you. <br/>Who does? <br/>You, you, you. You like to joke around. <br/>I don't think you're  focused. <br/>Really? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Rachel is definitely overeager. She's overly confrontative. When you're in a group setting, it can really bring a lot of  negativity to the group, and people don't like it. <br/>Will you go do what you were originally going to do, which  is get those sticks for the fire? <br/>I believe what needs the  happen is me and you need to get a machete and just build this damn thing  because there's a lot of talking going on and in the a lot of doing. So we need four corners obviously. I think we need one in the middle, on each side, that's six. <br/>Full disclosure, I've never actually built a shelter  before, but I take great directions. <br/>Welcome to the club, pal. <br/>I don't really like  sleeping outside, I don't like bug, I don't like the sun, I don't like water,  I don't like the ocean. All of those things are terrible. What I do love is the game play. And that's why I’m here. <br/>Just whack it? <br/>Yeah, whack it. You got the whack it pretty good. <br/>Right past the joint. <br/>Dave is just afraid of his own shadow. I was chopping the bamboo, and he was jumping up and covering  his ears like it was too loud. Cover your ears. <br/>You got to man up. There's girls with more testosterone back at that camp than he's  got. <br/>Guys? I think they may have found the hidden immunity idol because  there was something in their hand and I think they have it. <br/>Who's that? <br/>That's Ken and Paul. <br/>You think so? <br/>I do think so. I think we should ambush that right now. Is that weird? It's just better if we all know it. <br/>I don't think they have  it. What makes you think they have it. <br/>That thing in his left hand. <br/>He sure isn't hiding it. He's been casual. He doesn't want to make it obvious. <br/>No, they would be running off into the woods. <br/>I don't mean to be the  paranoid guy, but this is just totally suspect. <br/>Keep an eye on that left hand. If he comes back with something...  If he comes back with nothing. <br/>That's what I’m saying. <br/>If he comes back with something...  If he comes back with nothing, he's got an idol. <br/>Dave got real paranoid. He's also scared. He's funny at times and charming. <br/>I like you, I trust you. If I hear your name come up, I’m going to tell you. Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris, I trust you. If I hear your name come up, I’m coming for you. Please do the same for me. <br/>But don't be... Be nice. <br/>It's all good. It's all good. <br/>He's trying way too hard. He's scrambling around and talking strategy, and I think it's  just too early to be pushing too hard. <br/>Funny how the game's already started. <br/>I know. <br/>A little paranoid. It's got me a little nervous. <br/>The wind is picking up. <br/>I don't know that that's  a great sign. <br/>Uh-oh. <br/>That's a really bad sign. <br/>Heading into the first night, I’m a little nervous  because, oh, man, we're in a world of hurt when it comes to our shelter. We have no real roof. But every single person on this tribe thinks everything's going  to be okay. <br/>Are we going naked? No, we're not. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I’m telling you guys from  experience, not a good idea. <br/>But we're young millennials. We don't care. <br/>Everybody's so excited. Everybody's really happy to get to know each other. <br/>All right. Let's have some fun. <br/>I’m looking up at the  sky. It's getting dark. It's only going to get worse. Nobody seems to really care. I think the difference between gen-xs and millennials, gen-xs  believe you have to put in your time to get to where you have to be. Millennials don't believe that. They believe if you set to your mind to something and you dream big,  you can go and accomplish it now. <br/>Mama says come back in now. [thunder rumbling]  All of our projects are like half-way done. <br/>We're having a little party on the beach. And then we realize it's going to get dark. So we rush back because the shelter is unbuilt. <br/>All right, guys. We start off trying to keep ourselves dry with palm fronds  because we think rain is coming. Jay and I were trying to tie the roof together. Our shelter was definitely one of the worst in the history of "Survivor."  Okay. Just be careful. Be careful. We all go into the shelter. But when weight went on it, it was sinking. <br/>You all right? <br/>No, no. <br/>There's a weight limit apparently. <br/>It eventually cracked. And I’m thinking the myself, there's no way we're going to get  this shelter finished in time. <br/>I’m so scared that our  shelter is not good. <br/>No, it's not, but we'll survive. We will be okay. We will survive tonight. <br/>Dude, this is going to be so rad. <br/>We're terrified because it's pouring rain, and we don't  have a shelter. We're just sitting in the rain like freezing cold. It's just the hardest thing I've ever been through. It's the longest night ever. I am shaking. And you could feel people mentally breaking down. You feel like it's endless. I could hear the booming, the thunder and the lightning, and we  saw the storm from far out in the water making its way to us. It was like this monster was coming to get us and punish us for  not building a shelter. <br/>It doesn't look like this is going anywhere. <br/>We need to get going on this, man. <br/>I guess we got to split  these. <br/>What a miserable day. <br/>Oh, my God. Oh, my God. <br/>We just had basically a night of hell. <br/>Wow. <br/>And we didn't get our shelter completely made in time, and  it started raining. <br/>Oh, my God, it's so cold. <br/>And it never stopped. And it never stopped. And it never stopped raining! And it's still raining. <br/>Oh, yeah, this one, that bends that way. This isn't the best palm frontd either I guess. I'm sorry. <br/>Tree mail and a package. <br/>Oh, God. Is it a tarp? <br/>It's probably going to be a tarp. <br/>Tree mail, guys. Everyone, come on. It's the first one. <br/>Tree mail. <br/>Tree mail. <br/>All right. This is an unusually powerful storm and it's going to last a bit  longer. I know you haven't had enough time to build a shelter, so as a  gesture of goodwill, I’m offering this tarp as protection until you can build  your own. When the weather clears, bring it back the me. If I have to come looking for it, it will cost you more than  just the tarp. Good luck and try to stay dry. Jeff. [cheering]  I don't think they knew  it was coming. <br/>So put that on top of the palm fronds? <br/>I can't remember where a  tribe was actually give an tarp. <br/>I'll tie this here. <br/>We'll see what some of these people are made of. This is going to be a difficult "Survivor" season, in  my opinion. I think this weather is going to be something that none of us  were prepared for. [thunder rumbling]  As a gesture of goodwill, I’m offering this tarp as  protection until you can build your own. Good luck, and try and stay dry. Xoxo, Jeff. He doesn't say xoxo. <br/>Man, you know it's bad when Jeff gives you a tarp. You don't even have to win the tarp. It just comes in a tree mail. That's when we also knew, the weather's going to get worse, so  we have a lot of work to do. <br/>All right, you guys want to kick ass on the shelter? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Here we go. <br/>Watch your heads, watch your heads. <br/>I would rate our camp at  like pigpen level. It is just like a mud flat with sticks of bamboo stuck haphazard  about. I'm thinking, great, we'll build a base. We have a tarp. It's not going to be as bad as last night. It's hard, though, because the rain never lets up. And last night was like one of the hardest nights of my life. So I don't understand how it could get much worse than that. <br/>This looks pretty good. <br/>All right. That's secure. Ish. <br/>Tight, tight. Tight. Pull. <br/>Oh, what the...  Wow. <br/>So we're standing around in the mud from last night's  storm, and Jeff strolls casually into camp, and I don't know what's going to  happen, but I’m a little nervous. <br/>Jeff: Is this evidence of last night? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yes. <br/>It's been rough. <br/>Nobody slept. <br/>We didn't sleep at all. <br/>Jeff: Well, the storm is getting worse, so we sent the  tarp over this morning, thought maybe that would help you guys weather it,  but in the last few hours, it's been upgraded again. It is now a cyclone. <br/>Oh. <br/>Jeff: And the prediction is tonight it's going to be much  harder than last night. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: So for the first time in 33 seasons of "Survivor,"  we're going to evacuate. <br/>Whoa, whoa. Oh, my God. <br/>My jaw dropped. This is unprecedented. This is something that we've never seen. There have been bad storms on "Survivor," but we have  never done this in the history of 33 seasons of "Survivor."  Jeff: So here's the deal: You guys are going to collect  your personal items, grab your chicKens, we don't want the leave them out  here. You wanted adventure, you got it. [applause] all right. <br/>Are we leaving now? I have to figure out where my bag is. <br/>Wow. This is all going to be totally destroyed. This is not all fun and games. This is the real deal. This is a real cyclone, and there are real people's lives at  stake. <br/>Heads up. <br/>What? <br/>There he is, the man of a thousand tarps. <br/>What's going on? <br/>When I saw Jeff, my breath completely left my body. <br/>What's up, Jeff? <br/>I knew something was  wrong, because Jeff very rarely comes to camp unless it's a safety situation. <br/>Thank you for the tarp. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Jeff: Yes. So that's why I’m here. That tropical storm that I told you about yesterday is growing  in intensity. It's been upgraded again. <br/>Oh. <br/>Jeff: It's a cyclone. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Jeff: So we're going to evacuate you from this beach, take  you to a safe spot to wait out the storm. <br/>Can we grab our bags before we go? <br/>Personal items you'll take with you. Everything else, we'll just see what we have in the morning. All right, guys. <br/>Do we put all our food and stuff in the shelter? [thunder rumbling]  It's coming in. <br/>The cyclone is going to be hitting today, and I’m not  surprised actually that we're going to have some devastating weather tonight. And so we're actually going to be evacuated. Oh, my God. <br/>Here we go. <br/>Welcome, rain. <br/>Whoa! <br/>Jeff: Let's go! <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>Jeff: Let's go. Get on, get on, get on. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, trees down. <br/>Yeah, that's everything. We would have been totally hurt. <br/>On day three we came back to the camp after the cyclone  passed, and everything was knocked over, and a tree actually did fall on to  our shelter, so we're like, oh, my God, it's alarmling. It's scary. Now you're talking about our lives and someone getting injured  from a tree falling down. So it's good that we were evacuated. That was definitely a saving grace that Jeff made that decision  to do that. <br/>We got some work to do. <br/>All right. Let's start moving. <br/>Roger that. Let's get on it. <br/>Yeah, let's do it. <br/>First few days in "Survivor" are all about  building a shelter, and I am terrible at that. And I had to do it twice. I don't think anybody sees me physically strong. I got it. So there's no reason that they would want to keep me over  anybody else, and so it's really like resonating with me, that paranoia, that  nervousness, that anxiety that I’m on the chopping block. I've always been this neurotic guy. I was born afraid of dying. I think about it every day. <br/>So like in a plane or drowning...  Plane would be the worse. But just dying in general, I don't want to die. Whatever. <br/>Being out here really is like completely...  I came out here to expand  it. There's no bigger way to do it than this. <br/>Trying new things. Look at this guy. <br/>Whoa. <br/>It's a walking stick. It can't hurt you. It just walks around on you. <br/>It doesn't bother you? <br/>No. <br/>You sure? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I don't think there's  much hope for me, but I am a gen-xer and I don't give up. I'm going to work hard to make this happen. I'm going to turn this game around for myself. I need to start working really hard for the immunity idol. It might be the only thing that this save -- that can save me. <br/>Dave's looking for an idol. <br/>On the beach? <br/>I don't know what he's up  to. <br/>He was up on that mountain looking for the idol. We got the rein him in. <br/>He's out of control. <br/>He has to be an idiot. He has to be an idiot. <br/>That's ridiculous. <br/>David was out madly hunting for an idol when we were  building the shelter, and that upset a lot of people. If David has an idol, it certainly would complicate things  moving forward, so if we lose, it's going to be David. <br/>I have an idea for the  roof. If we can get some bamboo slats and tie the palm fronds on to  that. <br/>Okay. <br/>We get back the camp and it's a mess. We have a base and a shelter and we don't have a roof. So we needed to cobble this shelter together. I led the building of the second shelter. <br/>Do you want to have it the same way in  I don't know how to build  a shelter. I live in brooklyn. I know how the ride the subway. That's the extent of my outdoorsy skills. But you know what, I stepped up and I did it. So against all odds I have become the leader of this group. I never think of myself as the person who feels adept in the  outdoors. <br/>Keep going, keep going. <br/>You got it, you got it, you got it. <br/>I’m not that kind of  person, but I’m very intreepged by the idea of proving how tough I am. <br/>You got it, dude. <br/>You got it. <br/>So in a weird way, "Survivor" is helping me rise  to my potential. <br/>Fire. <br/>Go, go, go, go go,! <br/>Yes. <br/>We have fire. We have fire and I made it. I never in a million years thought I was going to be the guy who  makes fire without flint. <br/>You did it! <br/>Yeah, baby. <br/>I feel like a milestone  has been reached in my life, that I've become a new man. <br/>You're a fire starter. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I feel like "Survivor"  changes people. I already feel changed. <br/>Nothing will be the same. <br/>I feel like I’m growing  as a person out here. Like I am affected by this experience. In a very positive way. And I’m very proud hoff myself right now. <br/>I love you both. <br/>I know. <br/>We're a threat, a huge one. <br/>I know. I know. Okay. <br/>Honestly, yo, we're solid. The tri-force. I fricKen love you guys. I fricKen love you guys. Testify the tri-force. <br/>When you look at the group, I started noticing that there  has been this division between like the high school cool kids and the sort of  weirdo nerds. And I do feel like the misfits seem like they're going to be on  the outs. <br/>What do you think of the tribe so far? <br/>Figgy and the boys are a lock, so I need now squash that  in the bud. <br/>I need one in this game I  can trust. And I don't want like the...  I think it's important to  keep our numbers in the beginning, and I really do see it going two ways,  like the cool kiddos, and I think it can go weirdoes. "Freaks and geeks."  Freaks and geeks, that's a good way to put it. The good-looking, popular group is isolating themselves from the  entire tribe. So we need the tear apart that popular group. <br/>I just want to play the  game with the misfits. My goal is to play like I would play video games, so at this  point I’m pulling together the misfits and kind of the outcasts. They're ice letting themselves in a group of four. So I started putting into people's ears that the four pretty  people are inseparable. <br/>They're running the show. <br/>That's dangerous. So while we have all the numbers, this is our opportunity to  strike. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. <br/>Jeff: All right. First of all I’m so happy to see both tribes brought their  tarps. Thank you very much. You can drop those, leave them behind. All right. You guys ready to get to your first immunity challenge? [applause]  Jeff: This is what you covet in this game. The immunity idol. With this in your possession, you are safe. Without it, you could be voted out. For today's challenge, you're going to make choices that will  help you at either the front end or the back end of the challenge. Here's how it works. You'll race under an obstacle and retrieve a war claw. You'll then come a rope tunnel, which you can cross as is or use  a shortcut. That makes it much easier. You'll then come to a balance beach. You can run it as is or use a shortcut, making it much easier. You'll then carry a crate to the finish and use the pieces  inside to solve the puzzle. Here's the dilemma: Every time you use a shortcut, it adds ten  more pieces to the puzzle. So if you think you're great as puzzles. You might want the take the shortcut, sprint to the end and get  working on it as fast as possible. If you're not so sure about the puzzle, you may have to run the  course as is, knowing you'll be behind, but hopefully you can catch up with a  shorter puzzle. This challenge will come down to which group in the first few  days has learned the strengths and weaknesses of their tribe. First to finish wins immunity, safe from the vote, plus fire in  the form of flint. Losers, tribal council where somebody will be the first person  voted out of "Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen-x." give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started. <br/>Who is getting the club? <br/>I will. I'm going to do the big one. <br/>You sure? <br/>Who is doing the puzzle at the end? <br/>Me and Rachel both. <br/>Unless anyone else is really good? <br/>I think we need the take  a shortcut on the balance beam. <br/>Without even trying? <br/>I agree with that. <br/>Jeff: All right. Here we go, for immunity and fire, Survivors ready? Go! First step is to untie all of your clubs, two on either side. <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Jeff: Already a fight going on underneath. Jay and Chris going at it. You got to untie all of your clubs, those here and those along  the posts. Go to your mat, wait for everybody. Everybody has to be there with all your clubs. Chris blocking two millennials by himself. They can't get to their clubs. Got to have all your tribe members together. <br/>Got 'em all? <br/>Jeff: We got a fight going on. <br/>On the mat. <br/>Jeff: Go, gen-x, go! <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>Jeff: Gen-x going to take first shortcut. Rachel spending a lot of time. That's good. Go! Millennials not taking any shortcuts. <br/>We're going through this. <br/>Go. <br/>Jeff: Out of the gate, gen-x takes that first obstacle  much easier, a wise choice given the size of the bodies they have. Millennials much smaller. <br/>We don't need it. <br/>They're going to go without taking a shortcut. <br/>Jeff: Gen-x, they have got a lead right now. <br/>Ouch, ouch, ouch. <br/>Jeff: Here comes Paul, the biggest guy, getting through  there last. Go, gen-x! <br/>Come on. <br/>Jeff: Gen-x going the take the second short. Go. Gen-x taking both shortcuts straight across, let's go, let's go,  let's go. Millennials first working on that first only, regretting now  maybe not taking the shortcut. Huge lead for gen-x. Gen-x now moving to that last station. They'll be working on the most difficult puzzle. Let's go, millennials. There it is, millennials going to take the second shortcut. <br/>Turn it, turn it, turn it. Go, go, go, go, go. <br/>Jeff: Gen-x took both shortcuts. They'll be working on a 70-piece puzzle. The millennials took advantage of one shortcut. They'll be working on a 60-piece puzzle. They have ten less pieces in their puzzle. Gen-x has ten more pieces now. Their puzzle significantly more difficult. <br/>They're way behind. They have so many more pieces than us. <br/>Jeff: It is David and Rachel and it is Michelle and Figgy. It's going to come down to how fast you can solve this puzzle. <br/>Come on, guys, you got it. <br/>Jeff: Millennials starting to get some momentum now. <br/>Good job, Figgy. <br/>Jeff: I see their puzzle taking shape. David and Rachel have squandered the lead that the shortcuts  gave them. <br/>You guys see anything, let me know. <br/>We can't really see. You want to switch out? <br/>Yeah, go, go, go. <br/>Jeff: David and Rachel out. Jessica and Sunday now in trying to make up a lot of lost time. <br/>Good job, Figgy. <br/>Yeah, guys. <br/>Jeff: More progress by the millennials. <br/>Come on, making some progress. <br/>Jeff: Gen-x starting to make progress. Starting to take shape. Millennials down to their last several pieces. Gen-x desperately trying the catch up. <br/>On the right and left. <br/>Jeff: Rachel offering a lot of help from the sideline. She was first in, couldn't get anything done. <br/>Not anything? I did something. <br/>Jeff: Millennials getting closer to the finish. <br/>The one in the middle. Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Millennials win the first immunity and reward,  sending a signal to gen-x. <br/>One, two, three...  Millennials! <br/>Jeff: Millennials, congratulations. First immunity. Who wants it? [cheering] congratulations. Nobody going home from the millennials tribe. In addition, fire in the form of flint. <br/>Not that we needed it. <br/>Jeff: Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. <br/>Jeff: Gen-x, for one of you, this will be the end of the  road. Tonight somebody will be voted out of this game. The first person voted out, nobody wants it to be them. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. See you tonight at tribal. <br/>The challenge did not go how we hoped. It was just a disaster. Rachel's barking off orders. Dave told us he was the supreme puzzle maker and they failed on  it, so those two are on the hatchet. <br/>I wanted to beat the  millennials is bad. And I really thought that we wound. I think we have a lot of people with strength and experience. I really thought that we were going to outshine them today, and  I’m shocked that we didn't. <br/>Let's never do that again. <br/>Agreed. <br/>They're quick. They're sharp. But we have strategized the beginning of the challenge. We got screwed up on the puzzle. <br/>At the immunity challenge, Rachel tells everyone that she  can do puzzles, puzzles are her thing, and she screws it all up. <br/>I’m going to get water. Does anyone else want me to fill their water? You want to come? Okay, good. <br/>We need to go down and get water. Let's go down and get washed off. <br/>We have to win challenges. <br/>Well, the physical component of it, we were all right  there. <br/>And you two, I’m sorry, you should have been on that  puzzle because I thought you really were going to get it if you had a little  more time. <br/>If you say I'll do the puzzle and you don't do it good,  then you're out. <br/>If someone doesn't do well in the challenge, it's always  going to magnify that person. That's just the nature of the beast here. <br/>So right now we're going to be voting for Rachel, but my  fear obviously is a hidden immunity idol, if anybody has it. We're solid, right? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>All right. <br/>Everybody has been strategizing and not including me in on  any of it. I don't think anyone at this point trusts me. I know the position that I’m in, in this game right now. I'm on the chopping block. I think I’m going home tonight. <br/>Hey, guys, I'd love to talk. <br/>I don't want to go home  tonight. <br/>Right. <br/>And I’m willing to write down whose ever name you want me  to. <br/>I want to know 100% you  don't have an idol. <br/>100% I don't have an idol. Believe me, if I did I would play it. <br/>I was going the make a  deal with you if you had one. <br/>I don't have one. So I don't get a deal. I feel like you think I have one but I really don't. <br/>I know that's the chatter  that you have one. <br/>Full disclosure, I’m going the lay it all out, this is  exactly what happened in my head. I got a little paranoid and then I felt like I just wasn't being  included in on any strategy or whatever, and when I did was, yeah, I went  down here and I was snooping around hoping to find something I could find. You can write my name down if you want, it's your choice. I hope you don't, if you don't, you have my loyalty or whatever. <br/>I believe David has an  idol, even though he claims he does not. That makes me very nervous, so I want him to feel comfortable. <br/>Don't get paranoid and you're going to be okay. <br/>I think you'll be all  right. <br/>My decision is Rachel or David. <br/>I just think it's  interesting they're talking to everyone but me. <br/>Rachel, I think she's a liability. The reason I would vote out David tonight is because I believe  he has an idol. <br/>I appreciate it. <br/>But if I have six people, I have enough to flip the vote,  and I think we have myself, Chris, Paul, Sunday, Jeff and Lucy. So CeCe, Rachel, dave and Ken will be left out of who we're  voting for. <br/>So let's split the vote. <br/>Who do you think they're thinking about. <br/>I don't know. <br/>Deep down if people think I dropped the ball at the  puzzle. <br/>Something weird is going on. Do you see an alliance being formed? <br/>Yes. <br/>What do you think they're thinking? <br/>I don't really know  what's going on. I never actually thought I'd feel like this so early in the game  where I feel like CeCe and me, we're on the chopping block. <br/>I haven't had time to  think about it. <br/>I don't believe that. <br/>Believe it. <br/>I don't think it's a good  sign when people say, "I don't know," so I’m not really sure where  I fit in at this point. <br/>Chill out. <br/>I’m at the mercy of my  tribe mates. I'm my worst enemy in this game. I got paranoid, and I hope that the speech I gave them will be  enough for them to feel at ease and to save me. I worry that it won't. I'm pretty sure that it won't. But I won't know until tribal. <br/>Jeff: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead, grab a torch, approach the flame, dip it in, and get fire. This is part of the ritual of tribal council because in this  game fire represents your life. When your fire is gone, so are you. Sadly that will be the case for one of you tonight. But let's start at the beginning, because these first few days  have been some of the roughest that any group of Survivors has ever had to go  through. Jessica, even looking at you eyes right now, what's going on? <br/>Well, when we had to be evacuated because of the cyclone,  the winds were insanely intense, kicking up all kinds of sand, and I got hit  in my right eye with some sand, and I now have a bacterial infection in my  eye that I have now given to my other eye. <br/>Jeff: Bret, even when I was approaching the beach, the sam  was pelting me pretty hard and the storm hadn't even hit yet. <br/>I guess it's close to a  nor'easter in boston, but I think it's ten times worse. It was intense. You felt like it was never going to end. <br/>Jeff: David. <br/>Oh crap. <br/>Jeff: Sorry, what? <br/>Oh, crap. <br/>Jeff: Why do you say, "Oh, crap"? <br/>Because he's scared of everything. <br/>Jeff: Wow, David, all nine of them in unison say he's  scared of everything. <br/>This is first time I've been camping in over 21 years,  and, you know, my world has gotten smaller where I feel safe, but out here in  the elements, I’m stripped bare, and it's just so transparent. These last fur days it feels like it's a year long and I’m so  grateful for this experience. <br/>Jeff: Those are the words of somebody who might be okay  going home tonight. "I'm so grateful for this experience."  I don't want to go home  tonight. I really don't. But I might be going home. Like my biggest enemy in this game, honestly, is myself. And I’m running into that right now. <br/>Jeff: CeCe, can you feel David's pain? Nobody wants to be voted out, but nobody wants to be the first  person. <br/>Of course. I totally feel his pain. Like your dream is to be on "Survivor," and there's  chance you may be going home. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. It's just awful. <br/>Jeff: Sunday is it great to hear somebody saying, yeah, I think  it might be me? <br/>Absolutely, because I love David, but we're all here to  stay, and if you feel like attention is on someone else to go home, it takes  less off of you and maybe there's less chance you could be the one going home. <br/>Jeff: Of the ten of you, who here in the last few days has  had the thought, man, it might be me? <br/>I think all of us. <br/>Jeff: Chris, is it a real feeling, or is it just that  paranoia of who knows if these people are being straight with me? <br/>I think it's probably  paranoia. Day two I thought I was on the outs. I literally thought, oh, my God, I’m going to get voted out  first and never live this down back home ever. But I just kind of said, you know what, it's probably in my  head. I'll just show these people I can work hard and I feel a lot  better today. <br/>Jeff: Rachel, how about for you? Tell me about the moment where you thought, might be in trouble? <br/>Really today when everyone was undecided and not  responsive and pairing off, it was just really unusual behavior, so I don't  feel comfortable today. Maybe paranoia or maybe I’m actually going home. <br/>Jeff: Why do you think it would be you? <br/>I feel like I've been up  front and just say things that's on my mind. I say what it is. I don't mean to be mean or do anything to someone on purpose,  not at all. Whether you vote for me or not, it's more than I just want to  repair and amend. I want to apologize to everyone if I made you feel a certain  way. <br/>Jeff: All right. So let's talk about idols. Jessica, what's your take? Are there idols in the game, and do you think anybody on this  tribe might have one? <br/>I think there's  definitely idols in this game, and I think there were opportunities for  people the look for idols. I think that's part of why David got so paranoid, because that  was one of the concerns that came up about David. <br/>Jeff: Again, it goes back to David. <br/>Yeah, isn't it great? [laughter] you know, I respect that response. You know, I want the prove tonight that I can be trusted, and so  this is a test. <br/>Jeff: Wow. All right. It is time to vote. Paul, you're up. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. Okay. If anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,  now would be the time to do so. All right. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote David. Rachel. Sunday. CeCe. One vote CeCe, one vote Sunday, one vote David, one vote Rachel. Rachel. That's two votes Rachel. CeCe. That's two votes CeCe. Rachel. CeCe. We're tied. Three votes CeCe, three votes Rachel, one vote Sunday, one vote David. Rachel. Four votes Rachel, three votes CeCe, one vote left. First person voted out of "Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen-x," Rachel. You need to bring me your torch. Rachel, the tribe has spoKen. It's time for you to go. <br/>Jeff: Well, one of the hallmarks of gen-x, you're in the  afraid to work hard, and there is no question you've worked hard these first  few days. The bigger question is: How are you going to recover against  those millennials? The good news, fire in the form of flint will be waiting for  you. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Jeff: Next time on "Survivor," there's a romance  blooming. <br/>I got love goggles. <br/>Sometimes women blind you. Like wake up. <br/>Jeff: While someone's time in the game might be cut short. <br/>You have to breathe. <br/>He might have had a heart attack. <br/>This might be a mistake for me. <br/>"Survivor" is one of the most difficult and  brutal social games on the planet, however, I’m happy for the experience. And I hope to utilize it to grow as a person. It's a lot harder to survive the conditions than it probably  appears on tv. But for most of it, I actually had a lot of fun.
