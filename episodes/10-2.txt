<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor: In the island nation  of Palau, 20 new castaways began their adventure with a big twist. There are two immunity necklaces-- one for the first woman, one  for the first man-- who can get to shore and claim them. Go! With no other information to guide them, the race was on. Ian and Jolanda were the first to claim the necklaces. <br/>Whoo! Good job! <br/>We're not a tribe. We don't have our buffs. We don't have a clue what's happening next. <br/>All right, see if we can get this going. <br/>Probst: With all 20 on one beach, and no fire to boil  water, things got even worse on day two... All right, Ian, take a spot right  over here, Jolanda right over here. ...when the survivors finally learned the value of the immunity  necklaces. We're going to divide into two tribes with nine members each. There are 20 of you. Two people will be sent home. [survivors groaning] Ian and Jolanda made the first of the  schoolyard picks. <br/>Katie. <br/>Bobby Jon. <br/>Probst: And the two tribes were chosen, one by one. <br/>Willard. <br/>Probst: Willard was the last member picked for the older  Koror Tribe. <br/>Angie. <br/>Probst: And Angie was the last picked for the younger  Ulong Tribe. Jonathan and Wanda were out. [cheering]  Go get 'em, Wanda! <br/>I was really, really, really sad. I'm going to wipe my tears. That's in the past. It's a whole new game. <br/>Probst: All right. Let's hand out the buffs. Koror, you will wear brown. You guys are Ulong. You'll wear blue. Survivors ready. Go! At the challenge, the tribes competed for immunity and whatever  survival items they chose to take. The older Koror tribe took only the flint to make fire...  Come on! We got to go! <br/>Probst: ...while Ulong struggled with more supplies. Koror is up and over. <br/>Let's go! <br/>Probst: Koror's decision to travel light secured them  victory... Koror wins immunity and reward! ...and earned them the right to choose a campsite. You can either go back to what you know or you can start fresh. <br/>New adventure. <br/>Probst: You're going to take your chances. <br/>We're going to take our chances. <br/>Probst: But on the way to their new beach, disaster struck  the winning Koror tribe. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>All of the supplies to make fire went straight down. It was just like, "Did this really happen?"  We're in a worse scenario than we originally had. <br/>Probst: Back at Ulong, Angie knew she was a target going  into Tribal Council. <br/>You don't think I remember exactly the order in which we  got picked for tribes? The only reason we lost the challenge is 'cause we didn't leave  soon enough. <br/>Probst: But Stephenie felt Jolanda had held them back at  the challenge. <br/>We made a dumb mistake, and it's because of one person, I  feel. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Angie received three votes...  First person voted out of Survivor: Palau... ...but it was Jolanda who was  voted out. Jolanda, the tribe has spoken. 17 are left. 17 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Another day in paradise. <br/>Today we won immunity, which was fabulous. We won a great reward which was the flint, and up until that  point, everything was just wonderful. And of course, then there was a turn of events with the  capsizing of the boat, and... the flint is at the bottom of the ocean, so we  can't even get fire. <br/>It's a bummer and a buzz kill, but like we said, it was  just like a car accident, and we just got to get back from it. Get around the shock of it. [squeaking] [Janu shrieks] [shrieking]  Oh, my God, there were three! <br/>There's a lot of them...  When I first saw the rats, oh, my God, saw three of them,  and they were just [trills tongue] going to town. [gasps] I hear them. Like, they're right behind there. [squeaking] [gasps] What? <br/>You know what? I saw something, but...  They're, like, walking around. They're not afraid of anything. See? They're right there. <br/>Ooh! <br/>Ew! <br/>Get out! <br/>They're right there. <br/>I know it's mind over matter, and I know if you don't  mind, it doesn't matter, but, ooh, I mind and it matters. I just can't stand those things. They're huge. Ugh! <br/>Tom, I love the, uh, the new campsite choice. <br/>Really? <br/>Although, do you think there could be a worse island than  this? <br/>Oh, I'm sure there are. <br/>You think so? <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>It wasn't safe for us to choose this island. It was just a quick decision we made, and I-I regret that we  didn't think it through. Tom, having taken the leader role in the tribe, said,  "Let's go for it. It's an adventure." It was a rash choice made in a moment  that could really affect the game for this tribe. The way the whole thing came down, I think Willard said, "I  think we should take a vote." And you said, "I think we should do  it..."  Oh... okay. <br/>"We-We're on for another adventure, it's part of...  we're here for an adventure." Without having...  I-I just... I'm gonna disagree just because... I-I thought  we should go back, too, and then...  You did? <br/>...three guys-- three people-- were all saying, "No,  let's go to a new place. We're out of coconuts."  Can we agree that we should have a vote? <br/>Definitely. <br/>Even if it... if it's just to make a decision. Okay, okay, guys. Raise your hand. Who wants to go? Stay? Raise if you want to go. <br/>Caryn's really annoying, because she has not stopped  talking about how this island sucks and how everyone didn't want to come  here. [thunder crashing]  Oh, no! <br/>We only had a second to decide, and the majority was,  like, "Let's go," you know? New tribe, new camp. Unfortunately, it was the wrong decision. Oh, well, we're here. Get over it. Get over it. [thunder crashing] [thunder crashing]  We went to our first Tribal Council, and we got rid of Jo. I think it was a great decision, actually. I think our whole team thinks it, our whole tribe thinks it was. <br/>It's time to get up, y'all. <br/>Mmm...  Without Jolanda around, everybody's feeling good, you  know, 'cause there's nobody telling people what to do. We're not going to follow a leader. <br/>So what should we do? <br/>Well...  Wake up first. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We can make our own decisions and be democratic about it. We're Americans, and we're going to do democracy. Come on, y'all. Gather around. <br/>See what we got. <br/>You ready? <br/>Yeah. Get your ass up here, Ibrehem. <br/>All right. <br/>I hear you. <br/>Maybe not. [chuckles]  Go ahead, Bobby. <br/>"Keep on your toes while making this run. "Your rivals will seek to spoil your fun. "You'll, too, have the chance to spoil their mood. Stay out of the water, and you may catch more food."  I think we might fight people. <br/>Yeah, we're gonna... yeah. <br/>I'm not quite sure of my game plan yet. I know that obviously there are people who did vote for me, and  so, uh, I just want to make myself a valuable asset to this tribe. If I don't, I'll probably If I don't, I'll probably be on the  chopping block again. be on the chopping block again. <br/>Probst: Come on in. Take a spot on the mat. We'll now bring in Ulong. Jolanda voted out at the first Tribal Council. Koror, how's the fire working out? <br/>It's not too good. We capsized yesterday. <br/>We just kind of lost it. <br/>Probst: You lost your fire? That made Jeff really happy. <br/>As well it should. <br/>We're going to find it. We're the Bad News Bears, man. Our back's against the wall, and we're coming on strong. <br/>Probst: You guys ready for today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: It is for reward. Here's how it works. You will attempt to cross a balance obstacle course. Moving one tribe member at a time, you'll begin by swinging over  a trench. You'll then make your way over three rolling drums, across a  balance beam and over a wobbly bridge. Finally, you're going to cross a rope bridge where' you'll  retrieve a flag and make your way back to the start. Along the way, members of the other tribe are going to try to  knock you off by swinging heavy bags of sand. First tribe to collect ten flags wins reward. If at any time you're knocked off the course or you fall off the  course, go back to the start. Each tribe will assign two members to be in charge of swinging  the heavy bags. Only rule: everyone has to cross the rope swing at least once. Make sense? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: If you can't get food with this, you don't deserve  to be out here. <br/>Oh, hell, yeah! Come on, man. <br/>Probst: Mask and snorkel, fins...  Oh... Yes. <br/>Probst: ...spear. <br/>I love you, Jeff. <br/>Probst: In addition, Ulong, since you haven't won it yet,  you're playing for flint. <br/>You the man. <br/>Probst: Koror, who are going to be the two people  responsible for swinging the bags? <br/>Myself and Gregg. <br/>Probst: Tom and Gregg. Ulong? Jeff and Ibrehem. Okay, Koror, you have one extra member. You're sitting somebody out. You cannot sit out the same person in back-to-back challenges. Who's sitting out? <br/>Willard. <br/>Probst: Willard's going to sit this one out. Take your spots. Wait for my "go." Here we go for reward. Survivors ready. Go! James and Coby both across. James making quick work. <br/>Come on, baby! <br/>Whoo! <br/>James! <br/>Go, Coby. <br/>You got it, baby. <br/>Come on, James. <br/>Come on, James. <br/>Probst: James has a flag. He's heading back. <br/>Come on, James. <br/>Probst: Coby's in. Ian on the course. Oh, no! He doesn't make it. <br/>Go, go, go! <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon's on the course. <br/>Relax, relax, relax. <br/>Get that thing off me! <br/>There you go...  Probst: He's still on! Ian has a flag. <br/>Yeah, you got it, Ian. <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon has a flag, he's heading back. Ian trying to make up some ground. <br/>Oh, you're in! <br/>Probst: Oh! Ian's in. Oh! He's hanging on the barrels, he's hanging on. He's still on, still on. [groans] And he's out. <br/>Go. You can do it. <br/>Probst: Katie having trouble. Katie has to get across before Koror can continue. Angie is across. <br/>Way to go, Angie! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Go, go, go, go! <br/>Probst: Angie's got a flag, heading back. <br/>Get down low. Crawl! Good job, Angie. <br/>Probst: Angie making a run for it. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Way to go, Angie. <br/>Probst: There she goes. Angie puts Ulong on the board with their first flag. Ashlee's across. Katie still struggling. <br/>Whoo! <br/>You can do it. That's okay. <br/>Probst: Ashlee has a flag. She's going to start heading back. <br/>Go, girl. Come on. <br/>You got it. You got it. <br/>Ashlee almost there. <br/>Swing! Good, good. Yes! <br/>Probst: Ulong up 2-0. Stephenie's across for Ulong. <br/>Good job, Steph. <br/>Katie, keep your knees up. You're dropping them too soon. <br/>Probst: Stephenie has a flag. She's going to start heading back. Katie's across! She's on the course! <br/>Let's go, girl. <br/>Probst: Steph is across! Ulong leads 3-zip, but Koror is now back in this. Kim is on the course for Ulong. <br/>You go, girl. <br/>That's it, Katie. <br/>Come on, Katie. [shouting]  Probst: Kim passes Katie. <br/>Come on, Kim. <br/>Probst: Kim coming back. <br/>Good job, Kim. <br/>Come on, Kim, you got it. <br/>Probst: Whoa, just misses her. Katie spent a lot of time on the course. <br/>Katie, if you're too tired, just bail. <br/>Probst: Kim's there. Ulong in the lead, 4-zip. Angie back on the course. Too tired to continue. Katie just bails. Janu on the course for the first time. <br/>Get your knees up. <br/>Probst: Angie's unstoppable, back with another flag. <br/>Angie, you frickin' rock. <br/>Probst: Ashlee's across! Janu has a flag, and she's heading back. <br/>Let's go, Janu! You're doing fine! <br/>Probst: Ashlee has a flag. She's going to start heading back. <br/>Yeah, Janu! <br/>Probst: Janu across with the first score for Koror. Ashlee's across. Ulong leads 6-1. Jenn's across and on the course. <br/>That's it, Jenn. <br/>All right, Jenn. <br/>Probst: James is on the course. <br/>Lean your head down! You got it. Yes! <br/>Probst: Jenn and James on the rope bridge. <br/>You got it, James. <br/>Good job, James. <br/>Probst: James has a flag. He's heading back. Jenn has a flag. She's heading back. <br/>Come on, James. <br/>Probst: James easily deflects that. <br/>Jenn, you're looking great. Let's go. Nice. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: Ulong leads 7-1. Bobby Jon's on the course. <br/>That's right. <br/>Probst: Jenn's across. <br/>Come on, Jenn. <br/>Let's go, Bobby Jon. <br/>Probst: Koror now with two. A lot of ground to make up for Koror. And just like that, Caryn takes a hard one on the hip. Ian on the course. Ian... off the course. Bobby Jon has a flag. He's heading back. <br/>Mind over matter. Let's go. <br/>Probst: Coby getting centered. <br/>There you go. <br/>Probst: And it... doesn't help. Coby's out. <br/>Come on, Bobby. <br/>Let's go, let's go. <br/>Probst: Janu not giving up. <br/>You got it, Janu! <br/>Probst: Give her some room, B.J. Share that pontoon. [yelling]  Take your time. Take your time. <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon is across. [yelling] And he beats himself up as a reward. Ulong with eight flags. Janu worn out. Stephenie back on the course. Stephenie... Whoa, whoa! <br/>Good job. <br/>Beat her there, beat her there, Janu. <br/>Probst: Janu and Steph on the rope bridge. Janu has another flag. Steph has a flag. Janu working the barrels. <br/>Come on, Janu, you're almost there now. <br/>You got it, Janu. <br/>You got it, Steph. Come on! <br/>Go, Steph! <br/>Probst: Janu across with a flag for Koror. Stephenie's across with flag number nine. 9-3. Ulong leads. Ulong needs only one more flag. Kim could be the winner. At stake: fishing gear and fire for Ulong. Ian has another flag. Kim has a flag. Both heading back. <br/>Stay low, Kim. <br/>Probst: Tom, ooh, just misses. <br/>You got it, Kim. <br/>Good job, Kim. <br/>Probst: Koror with four if he can hang on, and he doesn't. [cheering] Kim is this close to victory for Ulong, and she's  across. [cheering] Ulong wins reward! <br/>Good job. <br/>Probst: Ulong, nice job. Here's fire. Who wants it? [whooping]  Probst: You now have fishing gear and fire. It should completely change life at your camp. Koror, I know what you're doing this afternoon. You're looking for that flint. You're looking for that flint. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. [all whooping]  Oh, my God. That was so awesome. <br/>We need to go catch us some fish. <br/>Hell, yeah. <br/>I want to get some water. <br/>16 fish would be good for us tonight. <br/>After winning the flint and the sling and the snorkel and  mask and fins, now we can eat. Now we can actually have some protein. <br/>Angie! <br/>I'm tougher...  Motivated us all, girl. <br/>When people think... I know I am. Everybody was like, "Wow, you did so great, you did so  great." And I was like, "Oh, my God, I needed this so badly."  This is exactly what I needed. I was like, I was ready to cry 'cause I was just so relieved. <br/>She... she showed me something. <br/>I definitely judged Angie way too quickly. She went into a challenge and dominated. I mean, completely dominated. I don't know what got into her, but it was good and it totally  changed the whole morale of our whole tribe. [murmuring]  Oh! <br/>Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yeah! <br/>Oh, my God. We're gonna drink water. Oh, my God. <br/>I love fire. It makes me want to cry. <br/>The second we got fire started, I wanted to try and see if  we could catch some fish. Maybe even go explore and see Maybe even go explore and see  what's all around us. what's all around us. [laughing] [laughing]  There's got to be bigger fish somewhere. <br/>I saw some big ones in there, dude. <br/>Well, at least we know that if there are some big fish, we  can get them. You know, I didn't get a whole lot, but I got enough so that  everybody could have a so that everybody could have a couple of pinches of  protein. couple of pinches of protein. <br/>Are you serious, bro? <br/>That's what I'm talking about, Jeff, bring in the bacon. <br/>Being well-fed and well-nourished is the huge advantage at  the next immunity challenge. I'm happy that they don't have their flint, and I hope their  flint, and I hope they don't find it. they don't find it. <br/>We're getting our flint and steel. We dropped the box, and we gotta go find it today. <br/>We went out at the absolute worst time, and the current  was ripping like I've never seen the ocean tide rip. It was like, almost like being in a fast-moving river. We were paddling as fast as we could and just barely holding  position. Come on, Ian! <br/>Give him the anchor. Go! On your right. <br/>You've got to keep paddling. <br/>I don't know if we were that far over. <br/>I don't think it was that far over. <br/>But I do think it was slightly that way. They're going to be so disappointed when they come back, if they  don't get it. <br/>Okay, I see it, I see it, I see it. [screams excitedly] Don't lose the spot. Don't lose the spot. We're drifting. It was definitely the strongest current I've ever faced in my  life. And the box was about 25 feet down. We tried everything; we tried hooking the anchor into the handle  on the box and bring it up, that up, but it kept slipping. <br/>Got it? [Ian grunts]  I feel like I lost it. <br/>Do you see it? <br/>As I got more and more tired, it became more and more  difficult to get to the bottom, became more and more difficult to tread  water. So, there were a couple of times when I was like, "Okay,  "you know, I'm underwater; I don't know if I'm going to be able to make  it." I had it hooked again. You see it? <br/>That it right there? <br/>I saw it when I just  I saw it when I just scratched the box. scratched the box. <br/>I got it! Hey, guys, just bring it over quick, please. Hurry. Hurry. Yeah! Yeah! [screams excitedly] [yells and laughs]  Ah-ha-ha! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yay! [cheering]  Yay! [screaming jubilantly]  Getting the box and having it was like, I mean, it was  like running the marathon and winning first place. Once we got it into the boat, it was like, man, it was like  holding on to a big piece of gold. [laughing] [whooping]  Nice job, Gregg. [laughing] [laughing elatedly]  It's one of the happiest moments of my life. It was definitely a high for all of us. And even though we lost the challenge, it really felt like we  won the day. <br/>Come on, fire. <br/>Okay, okay, blow. Don't blow too hard. <br/>Oh, my God. [indistinct voices] [clapping]  Good job, guys. <br/>A group effort, right there. <br/>Isn't that beautiful? <br/>I'm so proud of you guys. <br/>A good day. A good day. <br/>A good day. A good day. We can be proud. We can be proud. <br/>We got a lot of clam. <br/>Look at all of them. <br/>You want just to cook it all? <br/>Yeah. Yeah. <br/>You know, I hate clams, but I know this is going to be  good. <br/>Yeah. I haven't had giant clam before. <br/>Well, first time for everything, right? <br/>Tonight is gonna be our first time we had fire, our first  time we have water and our first time we're eating in four days since we've  been here. We're all famished and we're ready to chow down. <br/>Oh, my God, it's so good. How's the seaweed? <br/>Oh, my God. You know what? We can't complain right now, for real. <br/>Oh, I know. <br/>Hell, no. <br/>We haven't eaten in four days. <br/>We, for the first night, had actual food besides coconuts. Ashlee didn't want any of it. <br/>You don't like clam? <br/>The way we're gonna advance ourselves is be a strong team  all the way through, and if we have someone slowing us down, I hope that that  doesn't bring down our team. <br/>Ashlee went into the shelter, and she went to sleep. This fire was a big, big thing, and she should have came outside  and just kind of sat there. Sometimes we do things we don't want to do, but it's just things  you need to do, 'cause we are a tribe here and, you know, people will get  voted off this tribe in this game we're playing. <br/>I'm passing out. <br/>I'm fighting to stay awake right now. <br/>Yeah, I-I think I'm gonna... I'm gonna crash. <br/>Kim's been snuggling on Jeff a lot, and I'm not quite sure  how that... if she's playing him or not. I mean, two-people alliance is a very strong alliance, and so  I'm not sure if they're kind of buddying up to make an alliance. And so I'm kind of waiting to And so I'm kind of waiting to see  how that all will play out. see how that all will play out. <br/>Oh, look. <br/>What do you think it is? <br/>Dishes. Military dishes. It's a code. Lear... Learn. <br/>T...  "Learn this." It's "Learn this." We  need to learn this code. Hey, guys! <br/>Guys, we got tree mail. <br/>It's Morse Code. <br/>The tree mail just came and we're about to all learn Morse  Code. Right now, we've all broken it off into sections, 'cause there's  eight people. We don't know if that's a good strategy or not, but we think  it's the best one we got. Does anybody want to quiz me? <br/>All right, W? <br/>Dot-dash-dash. <br/>Winning the other day definitely gave us a confidence  boost, but we're going to have an immunity challenge here, an immunity  challenge here, and we got to win that, too. and we got to win that, too. <br/>Probst: All right, first things first. Give it up, Caryn. Immunity back up for grabs. Ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yep. <br/>Yes. <br/>Probst: You received tree mail this morning. It said learn Morse Code. I hope you did. On my "go," you'll swim out to a floating platform. You'll dive down ten feet, where you'll find a rope that's  strung through a barrel and attached to a footlocker that is 50 feet away. While underwater, you're gonna pull on a rope, and as you do  you'll bring that footlocker closer and closer. Every ten feet, a marker buoy will pop up showing you how far  you have to go. Once you've released all five buoys, that footlocker will be  right in front of you. You can open it. Eight mess kits will pop up. Bring them back with you to shore, you'll then use the Morse  Code painted on the mess kits to decode a hidden word. First tribe to solve the puzzle wins immunity. Safe from the vote. For the losers, a trip to Tribal Council, you will vote one  member out of your tribe. Make sense? Koror, you have one extra member-- got to sit somebody out; you  cannot sit out the same person. Willard sat out in the last challenge. Katie. All right. Everybody else take your spots. Everybody else take your spots. Wait for my "go." Wait for my "go." Here we  go. For immunity. Survivors ready. Go! All eight have to get to the pontoon before you can dive down. Got to have everybody at the pontoon before you can start  pulling on the rope. Willard falling behind. [indistinct talking] Ulong, go down. Ulong, go down. <br/>Go. Go. <br/>Go. Go. <br/>Probst: Koror has to wait. They cannot begin until Willard gets to the pontoon. Ulong getting a big head start.

Koror has to unclip eight mess kits. <br/>I got two here. <br/>Probst: Let's go, Ulong. <br/>Probst: Let's go, Ulong. Immunity at stake. Immunity at stake. Ulong still struggling to get their footlocker to them. We got 'em all. We got 'em all. Go! Koror has all eight mess kits.

Take off the burlap. <br/>"Immunity." Did you see...? <br/>Probst: Let's go, Ulong! <br/>Probst: Let's go, Ulong! <br/>Come on! <br/>Come on! <br/>I...  Y...  I...  I...  T...  Use the other "I."  No, "M" is... "M" is dash,  dash...  Dash, dash...  M...  Willard...  That's not...  Yes. <br/>Check it. <br/>You sure? <br/>Check it. <br/>Probst: Koror... [cheering] wins immunity! wins immunity! [cheering] [cheering] [cheering] [cheering continues] [cheering  continues] Koror, congratulations. Nobody going home from your tribe. Ulong, good effort. Sorry to say, another visit to Tribal Council. Another tribe member going home. Up to you to figure out who that's gonna be. who that's gonna be. Head on back to camp. Head on back to camp. <br/>When we lost the challenge today, everybody was so  disappointed, and to make matters worse, it was raining, so our main priority  was, oh, crap, I hope our fire didn't burn out. <br/>Get this. <br/>Luckily, we were able to scoop up any hot coals that we  could and rushed to a cave. <br/>Let's go to that cave down yonder. <br/>What cave? Cave down here we have to go to. Cave down here we have to go to. <br/>They're behind us...  They're behind us... There we go. <br/>There it is. <br/>We're good. <br/>Just run and go back and work on everything else. There you go. <br/>What do you want to do? You want to stay here or you want to go help? Both of us can't stay. <br/>Oh, dude, no. <br/>Ange, are you staying? <br/>I'll stay. I'll stay if you want to go back to camp. to go back to camp. We can... whatever you want. We can... whatever you want. <br/>I talked to Ashlee a little bit. <br/>Yeah. <br/>And I told her pretty much that, you know, I was down with  any sort of alliance 'cause you guys really pulled through for me last time. <br/>I know. <br/>Kim's not pulling her weight  Kim's not pulling her weight as much as everybody else. as much as everybody else. <br/>At the immunity challenge, Kim didn't want to help the  team pull that chest. So I'll tell you how it's going to happen. Kim is gone. <br/>Oh, yeah, for sure. <br/>And it's obvious to me you're attracted to Kim, okay? And right now, psychologically, sociologically, I'm seeing Kim  as a threat, you know? <br/>Yeah. I just... I mean, I was thinking Ashlee, to be honest. She's-She's breaking down, man. I can see it. I mean, I can tell she's breaking down. <br/>She's not a threat, though, at the moment. <br/>James is definitely rubbing me the wrong way. He doesn't have the right to come to me and say, "Oh,  listen, it's Kim over Ashlee." Well, not to me it's not. Ashlee has kind of changed her frame of mind. I can see her slowing down. I mean at this point, let's vote off our weakest link. <br/>Hey, Steph. <br/>What? <br/>After kinda like thinking, I think we push Ashlee. <br/>Yeah? <br/>I mean, just being honest with you. <br/>Honestly, Kim and Ashlee are just... they're about right  here. You know, one's up, one's down. One's up, one's down. So you gotta go with your gut instinct. <br/>But I'm telling you that we need to break her and Jeff up  because...  I don't see what's wrong with that, really, right now. <br/>You don't? But if they stay together, they're going to go. They're going to go to the end. <br/>Mm, not necessarily. <br/>I mean, she didn't even try at the challenge. She stood up there. <br/>Yeah. <br/>She wouldn't go down in the water. The bottom line is we have to think of who's going to be better  for the team right now so we don't have to go back to Tribal Council. Angie, myself, James and Ashlee still want to vote Kim off. Bobby Jon is undecided. So it's a complete mess, because actually, now it looks like  four people are voting against Kim and four people are voting against Ashlee,  so we're going to have a tie. I don't even know what happens in a tie. <br/>What are you doing? <br/>Dude, I don't even know. <br/>I don't know now. <br/>Is it me? <br/>Between you and Ashlee. <br/>Really? Who said me? <br/>It's, like, the consensus. Everybody. <br/>I want to know. If I'm going to get voted off, I want somebody to tell me that  they're voting for me, and I will respect the people a heck of a lot more if  they can just be, like, "Yes, I'm voting for you." I don't want to  frickin' go home. I don't think I should have to go home. But, J, look at me. I want you to swear to God that you'll tell me if you're going  to vote for me. <br/>I'll tell you. <br/>Okay. <br/>I promise, okay? <br/>Bobby Jon wasn't sure. He thinks it's gonna be you, but... I'm totally not thinking,  like, smart at all. <br/>Well, maybe they're trying to do the same thing we're  doing. Those four in an alliance, and then if one of us goes, we're  going to be picked off one by one. <br/>I really think it's going to end up in a tie if everybody  sticks to where they're at right now. Obviously, you can't assume anything in this game. So they might do something totally different, and I don't  totally different, and I don't know. know. <br/>Probst: Very subdued faces. Tribal Council wasn't fun the first time. Not going to be any more enjoyable tonight. Well, first, let's start with some of the good things. Angie, from where I sit, an amazing turnaround, considering you  were last picked, thought you were nearly out of this tribe, and then we we  get to this reward challenge and you dominated. Was there an impact with the tribe? Did they recognize that? <br/>I think that they did recognize. I think that when somebody was saying that I was a physical weak  link, I think that kind of got into the heads of other people, even though it  wasn't necessarily true. <br/>Probst: Well, here's the good news. You did win the reward challenge. And with that came fishing gear and fire. The bad news of what's happened over the last couple of days,  you lost another immunity challenge. Kim, what was the reaction when you got back to camp, knowing  you were going to come back to Tribal Council and vote somebody out? <br/>I think it was actually total devastation. I mean, we've become really, really close. I don't think you're prepared for how quickly you bond with  people. I mean, I... at home you never feel this way after, what, six  days with somebody? But we rely on each other so much. <br/>Probst: Jeff. Any friendships? Flirting? Adversaries? Give me something. <br/>Honestly, Kim and I have gotten to know each other a  little bit more than I think I've gotten to know some of the other girls. <br/>Probst: Kim, when did you feel the first initial seeds of  any attraction? <br/>It's hot in here all of a sudden. [laughter]  Probst: Day one? <br/>Actually, yes, it was day one. Because I couldn't sleep and he was staying up, so...  Probst: Steph. Have you noticed Jeff and Kim? <br/>Yeah, they hang out a lot. They cuddle. <br/>We've all noticed. <br/>All jokes aside, it really is nice to have someone laying  next to you when you're cold. It's a big difference. <br/>Probst: The problem with that, Jeff, is you get into a  game that is based on social relationships and it's about voting and numbers. <br/>I see that completely, but I think everybody here  understands that there's no alliances being built here. <br/>Probst: Kim, obviously, you must feel the same way. <br/>Under my observations, I hope that they understand that  it's not... I mean, it's never crossed my mind that that's going to change  anything or influence anything. <br/>Probst: It's never crossed your mind that they might look  and say... "Well..."? <br/>Not until now. Really, in all honesty. <br/>Probst: James. What are you basing your vote on tonight? <br/>I got my mind made up. It's somebody that I think can't hang with the rest of us,  they're lagging and they're... ready to go home. <br/>Probst: Okay, it is time to vote. vote. Steph, you're up. Steph, you're up. <br/>Ashlee was the one that picked me to be on this tribe, so  I just feel like I have to be so I just feel like I have to be somewhat loyal  to her right now. somewhat loyal to her right now. <br/>I'm a man of my word, and plus, you just bug and plus, you  just bug the hell out of me. the hell out of me. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... ...Kim. Ashlee. One vote Kim; one vote Ashlee. Jeff. One vote Kim; one vote Ashlee; one vote Jeff. Ashlee. It's two votes Ashlee. Ashlee. That's three votes Ashlee; one vote Kim; one vote Jeff. Second person voted out of Survivor: Palau: Ashlee. Based on the votes cast, four is enough. four is enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Ashlee, the tribe has spoken. Ashlee, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. It's time for you to go. Well, I sense that tonight's vote was tough. I do believe you guys are a tight tribe with a lot of good  energy, but my take? Get a clear goal first, then harness that energy. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:  They're coming closer. <br/>Probst: Koror goes hunting. <br/>There he is. <br/>Probst: Ulong faces a setback. <br/>I can barely put any weight on it right now. <br/>Everything I say, you have some snotty remark...  Probst: And Caryn and Katie have it out. <br/>Get off me! <br/>Get off me! <br/>She's completely lost it. <br/>She's completely lost it. <br/>I'm just so incredibly grateful to have had this  opportunity. I'm not surprised by the votes tonight. I think that they all sensed I was ready to go home. The only regret I have is that I did not use the excuse that I  was cold to cuddle with Ibrehem to cuddle with Ibrehem 'cause he sure is a  cutie.
