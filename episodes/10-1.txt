<br/>Jeff Probst: We are cruising through a remote and  absolutely breathtaking section of the Pacific. Crystal-clear water that is home to one of the most spectacular  natural wonders of the world, the island paradise of Palau. It is a unique landscape, featuring hundreds of lush islands,  magnificent coral reefs and an underwater sanctuary of sea life like no  other. Sharks, manta rays, giant clams, and literally millions of  jellyfish. But this paradise has an infamous history. These waters were home to some of the most fierce battles of  World War II, and the remnants of war haunt these jungles and litter the  ocean floor in a watery grave. It is an eerie mix of man's explosive past and nature's power to  reclaim. For the first time ever, there are 20 survivors. They've been set adrift with only the clothes on their backs and  one canteen of water each. Everything they've come to expect about the way this game begins  will soon be wiped out. 39 days, 20 people, one survivor. [theme song playing] Welcome... to Survivor: Palau. Just behind you, that beach is your new home. Waiting for you, you will find: two machetes, one map to water,  along with the most valuable thing in this game: immunity. There are two immunity necklaces. One for the first woman, one for the first man who can get to  shore and claim them. How you get to shore is up to you. You're still about a mile out. You can paddle in, you can start swimming, a little of both. You are all on your own, it is your choice, but I suggest you  make a decision and start acting now, because this game is on. <br/>Paddle. <br/>Let's paddle. Paddle. <br/>Probst: Good luck. <br/>Jeff's a son of a bitch. <br/>Probst: Good luck. <br/>Jeff's a son of a bitch. I can tell you that. Hell, I thought we were gonna get, you know, some breakfast,  food and water or something. Hell, no. I knew he was gonna say something like that, that he was gonna  say, "The game is on." Something told me. We was... pretty much in trouble. <br/>As we were rowing the boat, and we were getting closer and  closer to the beach, everybody was thinking, "Should I jump out? "Should I swim to the shore? Should I try to beat the boat?"  [ grunts ]  The fight was on immediately. And then people said, "Oh, I'll take your spot rowing in  the back." And other people were whispering and wondering, oh, is that  because they want to be at the back of the boat so that when the boat gets  close to shore, they can run off? to shore, they can run off? <br/>As we were slowly rowing in, I was, like, I think it's  close enough, I'm gonna jump, I'm gonna swim. 'Cause I'm a pretty good swimmer, so I figured I could beat the  boat. Didn't seem like we were moving. Everybody, I'm going. <br/>Stephenie just said, "I can't take it. I'm gonna jump in," and then I... of course, I was right  behind her. I'm out of here. All right, let's go! <br/>Watch out for the oar! <br/>I got in, and, like, every two strokes, there went the  boat, and I was, like, "Oh, my God, that's the dumbest thing I've ever  done." If we get off, can we get back on? What are your names again? [ others laughing ] Oh, my God! Bad idea, I guess? <br/>When Stephenie and Jonathan dove in the water, everyone's,  like... [sputters] [laughs] "You don't want to be the first one to dive  in!" God! That is a gigantic target on your head. <br/>We were all excited, because we wanted to jump and start  swimming, but we didn't. We kept waiting and waiting and waiting. <br/>The competitive nature in me was like, "You got to  take off your shoes and go!" [ whooping ]  Good job! I got the immunity necklace. I was not gonna let that... little young girl beat me. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Good job. Nice to meet you. What was your name again? <br/>Jeff. <br/>Ian. <br/>Good job, man. <br/>Ian, he was the first one up there. Get his ass up there, skinny boy, I'm telling you, that's a fast  little booger. Well, I don't even know if we have a tribe, because I noticed  the banner just says, "SURVIVOR: Palau." It doesn't have any tribe  name on it. <br/>One map, we're all together. <br/>Because you've never seen the game start this way, with 20  people, you get a little... I found myself getting a little paranoid. You know, we're not a tribe, we don't have our buffs, we're just  getting to know everyone's name. <br/>I'm Jolanda. "Jo" if you can't say it. <br/>Oh, you guys, they're out there! <br/>Something's gonna happen, something big's gonna happen. We can't just remain as a group of 20. It's a big question mark. We don't have a clue It's a big question mark. We don't have a clue  All right, everybody, let's, um... think about who wants  to do water, who wants to do shelter. <br/>I'll do shelter. <br/>I'll do water. <br/>Okay, water people...  Water. <br/>So we got one, two, three, four, and Coby's five. Okay. That sound like a good plan? <br/>Say what? <br/>Five people go look for water and 15 start on the shelter? <br/>Yeah. <br/>When we got on the beach, it was such a bore with all the  immunities and just the craziness of just being dropped off. But, actually, I think we got to things fairly quickly. I mean, we found the map to the water source, we started  thinking about shelter and food, and so people just broke off, a group of  four broke off to go get water. And then everybody else stayed with shelter. I mean, it was very quick, it happened very fast. <br/>He knocked it down like Paul Bunyan. <br/>I know. [ laughs ]  You okay? <br/>Yeah. <br/>You know, it was funny, I mean, uh, everybody's just  walking around in different directions. "Let's get the water," "Let's build a  shelter." And, uh, you just got to watch that. You know, I had a few people try to wrangle me into doing the  fire, and I'm just, like, that's a loser job, man. All right. <br/>Let's get this going. <br/>Oh. I got to go to the bathroom. <br/>I'll get some more sticks. <br/>Do we have a strong man here? Come on. Are you like Hercules? Come on, Hercules. Hercules! Hercules! Hercules! We came out in the clothes we had on, and were kind of taken by  surprise that we couldn't have, you know, the clothes that we had thought we  were gonna have with us. It was really difficult, I know, for a lot of people. But there have been some great modifications to it, so...  Don't, like, hack, like, saw. <br/>Oh, yeah. Oh, I've made shorts back in the day. <br/>Oh, gosh, they're just chopping things off left and right,  pants are falling off, and skirts are getting a little bit higher, and shirts  are getting tied up. I had mine tied up earlier, but... decided to... stop for now. <br/>I'm trying to find the middle. <br/>What's that? <br/>That big rocky thing. [ whooping ] We found it! Yes! [ whooping ] What else? [ whooping ]  We were so excited to get to the water. <br/>Coby! <br/>What the hell is this? <br/>Shoes! <br/>Shoes! So we finally found the water source, and also found a bag of  everybody's shoes, which was really nice to take back into camp, Like,  "Look, no more stilettos. We have real shoes."  We can't let young, good-looking people have all the  power. <br/>That's what I was thinking. <br/>'Cause there's a lot of them. <br/>Yeah. Me and Coby pretty much knew when we saw each other that we were  going to be, you know, kindred to one another 'cause we understood being  different, we understood being ostracized. Yeah, I have to say, I sighed a sigh of relief when I saw you  'cause I realized I wasn't gonna be the weirdest one here. <br/>[ laughing ]  I mean that in a loving way. <br/>I felt the same way. I was, like, "Oh, we're gonna totally get  along."  You can tell that Angie and I are both cut from the same  cloth, in that we think we're different and we're the outcasts, but I think  we're both gonna have to watch it when it comes to the context of the game,  'cause if we're too much of an outcast, obviously it's gonna make us a  target. <br/>Now how do we get that up there? I don't know. Tom, what were you thinking with this? I got this up here. Actually, what we're gonna need is, we're gonna need somebody to  get up here to start putting these cross pieces. <br/>The boys really got together and they used... We used one  big tree as our base for our shelter, and then they put reeds up, and they  said we needed to tie them at the top, so I offered. <br/>Oh, my God. Nice job. <br/>Oh, watch it. <br/>There you go. I'm loving you already. <br/>Okay. I don't know if it was a good thing or bad thing, but I wanted  to help and I figured my rock-climbing skills would help, so I climbed that  had puppy like a monkey and I did what I could. <br/>Come on, sucker. <br/>Where's the sun? Beating down on me all day long. I think it is, like, 2:30. Do you believe this? <br/>I know. It's amazing. <br/>So what are you thinking? Ian, me, you? Just an early something here? We might all be split tomorrow, but, uh.... <br/>I'm in with that, with you guys, 'cause we would be  strong. The whole thing could be reshuffled, but...  Yeah, absolutely. <br/>Grasshoppers have protein. [ yelling ]: Wow! I just ate my first grasshopper! Oh, my God. Do you want to knock off threats, or do you want to... You don't  know how the game's going to play out after that, right? <br/>Are you not leaning towards any of the girls? <br/>Honestly, I'm not leaning towards anyone. <br/>I'm leaning towards Jonathan. The one who jumped in the water. <br/>Although he worked so hard today...  Everybody's working hard, really, when you look at it now,  I mean, in their own way. I'm just going with connections. I don't real connect with him. I don't think I've said anything to him the whole time I've been  here. Honestly. I don't think he's talked to me either. Everybody's assumption at this point is that we're all basically  screwed because we all think we have Tribal Council, like, now. <br/>We don't even know if we're going to be on the same team. <br/>I know, but that's why you just got to go for today. Right, but that could change tomorrow. <br/>So we thought we had three days of at least getting to  know everybody, at least. You know, we don't know if we have that, so everybody's security  has been blown, so everybody's freaking out. <br/>Whoa! <br/>But I've definitely gone to different groups all day today  and said, "Who are you going to vote for? "Really? That's interesting. "What about voting for this person? What about Jonathan? Hmm. Good." And as long as I do it subtly... You go, boy. ...and sneak it in there, you can change their minds, 'cause at  this point, everybody doesn't want it to be them. Good morning, everybody. <br/>Good morning. <br/>This one's cashed. <br/>Probst: What's going on, guys? <br/>Oh, hey, how you doing there, Jeff? <br/>Probst: What's up? <br/>Here we go. <br/>We got visitors! <br/>Probst: What's up? <br/>Whoo, Jeff. <br/>Probst: How are you? How's everybody doing? Big group. Anxious to know what's happening? <br/>ALL: Yeah! <br/>Probst: All right, so Jolanda and Ian, you guys were the  first two to the beach. Who was the first person? <br/>Ian. <br/>Probst: Ian. All right, Ian, take a spot right over here, Jolanda right over  here. Getting a little uncomfortable over here? <br/>Yep. <br/>A little nervous now. <br/>Probst: How's that immunity feel, Jolanda? <br/>It feels good. <br/>Probst: It ought to feel real good. The immunity necklaces that you're wearing guarantee that you're  gonna stay in this game for at least ten more minutes. Which cannot be said for the other 18 of you. We're gonna divide into two tribes with nine members each,  that's 18 people. There are 20 of you. Two people will not be selected to be on a tribe. Two people will get on a boat, immediately, and be sent home. Ian and Jolanda you will make the first picks, alternating  between men and women. Each time you choose a person, that person will choose the next  member of the tribe. Ian, because were you first to the beach, you will select first;  you're picking a girl. <br/>Okay. <br/>Uh, Katie. <br/>Probst: Jolanda, you're picking a guy. <br/>Bobby Jon. <br/>Good choice. <br/>Probst: So, Ian and Jolanda, your work is done. The person you pick will now pick. Katie, you're picking a guy. <br/>Tom. <br/>Probst: Bobby. <br/>Stephenie. <br/>Probst: Tom, you're picking a woman. <br/>I'm gonna take Janu. <br/>Probst: Janu, still in the game and relieved. Steph, you're picking a guy. <br/>Jeff. <br/>Probst: Jeff, gonna make it to at least the first  challenge. Janu, you're picking a man. <br/>Gregg. <br/>Probst: Janu, you look upset. <br/>No, it's just kind of weird. <br/>Probst: Kind of weird? You don't do this a lot? Jeff, you're picking a girl. <br/>Kim. <br/>Probst: Kim stays in the game. Gregg, you're picking a woman. <br/>Jenn. <br/>Probst: Kim, you're picking a guy. <br/>James. <br/>Probst: Jenn, you're picking a guy, tough decision. Getting down to it. <br/>Uh... Coby. <br/>Probst: James. <br/>Ashlee. <br/>Probst: Coby, you're picking a woman. <br/>Caryn. <br/>Probst: Caryn, how does that feel to be standing over  there? What's going through your head? It's not a good feeling, Jeff. It's better to be on this side. <br/>Probst: Ashlee, you're picking a guy. <br/>Ibrehem. <br/>Probst: You each have one pick left. You're gonna pick one guy, gonna pick one girl. In doing so, you're gonna pick the final members of your tribe  and effectively vote out two people from this game. How you feeling, Wanda? <br/>It's been an awful long time since my heart pounded this  fast. <br/>Probst: Jonathan, how you feeling? <br/>I'm just... My heart's beating. I thought I was gonna be picked before this. <br/>Probst: Okay, it is time to make the final selections. Caryn, you're picking a guy. Make your decision. <br/>Willard. <br/>Probst: Willard stays in the game, Jonathan is out of the  game. Ibrehem, you're picking a woman. Make your decision. <br/>Angie. <br/>Probst: Angie stays in the game. Wanda is out of the game. Tough to say, but, guys, it is time for you to go. Right past me, you got a boat waiting out here. <br/>Go have some chips and salsa. <br/>Go get it, Wanda. Go get it, John. Come on, now. <br/>I love you, too. Come on, now. <br/>I love you, too. Have a good one, guys. <br/>Bye! <br/>I was really, really, really sad. But that's all right. I'm gonna wipe my tears and refocus. That's in the past. It's a whole new game. All right. Let's hand out the buffs. [ cheering ]  All right. <br/>Probst: You guys are Ulong. You wear blue. Your tribe-- Karor. You will wear brown. Brown. <br/>All right. <br/>Probst: Okay, so you're now two tribes-- Ulong, Karor. Two tribes still living together on the same beach. Head on back. <br/>Get out of here. <br/>Are you serious? [ laughing ]  That's the plan. <br/>I really thought you're giving away the competition. [ laughing ]  It's definitely going to be weird, all staying on one  beach together, though. It's still coming through, though. <br/>It hurts to be last, but...  Oh, yeah. I felt horrible being picked last. I didn't think that I was going to be picked last. <br/>How many girls we have, five? <br/>I thought 100% that Coby was going to pick me. <br/>Five and four. <br/>Five and four. I don't feel like I'm on the tribe that I should be on, so  there's no kindred feelings with my tribe. I'm the odd man out. <br/>Never had anything against you, ever. <br/>Guys, if there's any sort of competition that they are  trying to put into this game already, let's not be the ones that start into  that. <br/>No, no, no. <br/>Our average age is higher. but let's try to weaken them when it comes to physical stuff. <br/>I'm altogether very, very happy. I wanted a wise tribe, if I had the opportunity to pick. We got a little bit of the older folks, which I really like, and  we're up against a bunch of the young bucks. You compare the tribes and you see a definite difference. They come to you and say, oh, listen, so and so on your team was  talking about you... they are just trying to break us up. <br/>I love everybody on this team. <br/>We definitely have some kind of advantage, which I don't  care what you say, you know, smart's in it, too, but athletics is going to  play a part in it, also. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. You guys ready to get to the challenge? <br/>ALL: Yeah. <br/>Probst: It is both reward and immunity. Here's how it works. Both tribes are going to compete head-to-head in a jungle  obstacle course. You'll make your way through a net maze and then through a  series of tires. You'll reach a covered supply dump, where you will find a set of  paddles you must take tied to four survival items you can choose to take or  leave behind. Fire in the form of flint, two cans to carry water, flour and  rice for your food and a tarp for shelter, but the crates that these items  are in have been weighted to make them very heavy to carry. Untie all of your items, continue through the course carrying  the items. You'll go up and over a wall, through a jungle swamp. When you reach your canoe, drop the items you chose to take with  you, get in the canoe, paddle out to retrieve a flag and race back to shore. The first tribe to get back to their mat with all nine tribe  members and their tribe-colored flag wins immunity and all the items they  carried to that mat, keeping in mind you can only win the items that make it  all the way to the finish. So, it becomes a choice. You want to win to guarantee yourself immunity, but you want to  win with as many items as possible. Now let's get to immunity. Ian, Jolanda, you can you take those off. Like I said, those guaranteed you'd stay in the game ten more  minutes. Those ten minutes are over. This is what you covet now. Immunity-- the only thing that keeps you safe in this game is  this. As long as you have it, you can't be voted out. Take your spots and wait for my go. Here we go. For immunity and reward. Survivors, ready... Go! Tom with a big head start. Neck and neck right now. Tom the first one over for Koror, followed by Gregg. Here comes Jeff for Ulong. <br/>Come on, come on, come on! <br/>Probst: There's Ian for Koror. We're tight. There's Jenn. Koror got a bit of a lead. Here comes Caryn for Ulong. Ulong in one fell swoop catches up. <br/>Come on, let's go, guys! <br/>Probst: Ulong moving on. Koror, go! Up and over, however you want. Neck and neck still. <br/>Come on! <br/>Probst: Start pulling those off. You gotta move all your items to the mat before you can start  untying them. <br/>Let's go, guys. <br/>Probst: Get that last item, Koror. Ulong, start untying. This is where you make your first decision. Are you going to take all your items or not. Koror working together well. Koror, very close. Koror is free. Koror is leaving their food and their water, taking only their  fire with them. <br/>You guys, come on! We gotta go. <br/>We're gonna lose. <br/>I'm telling you, I think we should go. You guys, finish it up. We gotta go. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: Ulong, keep it moving. Koror first to the wall. <br/>Two people push me up that wall. One, two, three. <br/>Come on! <br/>This way, this way. <br/>Come on! You got it, Ulong! <br/>Get out of the way. Ahh! No...  Try jumping down. <br/>Probst: Here comes Ulong right on your tail. Koror having trouble getting Willard over. Ulong brought food and water, did not bring fire. Interesting strategy. Koror is up and over. Koror, go. Ulong really struggling. Koror making their way through the swamp with a big lead. [ grunts and groans ] Ulong finally over the wall. Koror first to their canoe. The strategy was to only bring fire, and it's working so far. Paddle out. Get your flag. Come on. <br/>Probst: Let's go, Ulong! Keep it moving. You're still in this. Get in, get in. The rest up front. Ulong, go. Paddle out. Hustle up, guys. Good paddlers might be able to catch them. <br/>Get to that side. Right side paddle backwards. <br/>To the right side! <br/>Paddle faster. <br/>Paddle on the right. <br/>Probst: Koror still with a big with a big lead. <br/>Left to right side. You'll get taken off to do it. Right side. <br/>That's good, that's good. All right, now listen, both sides. <br/>Turn it around. <br/>We're going the wrong way. <br/>Probst: Ulong, the flag is that way. [ indistinct shouting ]  Guys, let's freakin' paddle! Ulong is looking for another island. <br/>Go. Go. <br/>Probst: Koror working together, straight, strong, fast. <br/>Come on! Come on! <br/>Come on! <br/>Probst: Ulong having a heck of a time paddling. <br/>Too many people on one side. <br/>Probst: Frustration setting in for Ulong. <br/>We're going to get it. [ whooping ]  Whoo! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: Koror wins immunity and reward! <br/>Yeah! [ whooping ]  Good strategy. <br/>Probst: All right, Koror, nice strategy. You chose to only bring fire. You can boil water with that. You can cook food with that. Okay, here's immunity. Yes, yes, yes! You are safe from the vote tonight. One other decision. Because you won, you get a choice. The two tribes will no longer be living together on one beach. You can either go back to what you know and the shelter you help  build, or this is a map to a new unknown beach where you can start fresh. <br/>But why see a beach we already saw? Let's go see something new. <br/>New adventure. <br/>Probst: You're going to take your chances. <br/>We'll take our chances. <br/>Probst: Give up what you know for the unknown. <br/>Yes, we are. <br/>Probst: Here's your map to your new home. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Ulong, good news is, you're going home. You're taking your outrigger canoe with you. Bad news is, you're get some much-needed practice when you  paddle to Tribal Council tonight and officially vote out the first member. Get your stuff, head on out. <br/>After the challenge, Get your stuff, head on out. <br/>After the challenge, we were so excited. We won immunity, and we won the stuff that we needed to make  fire. We were so the underdog. Winning that was huge for us. [ indistinct chatter ] This wave came, and we went over. I don't know what the deal was with, you know, who was leaning  what way or what, but I think it was just a combination of all forces, and we  just went down. All of the supplies to make fire were in this heavy steel  container that went straight down. It was just like, did this really happen? <br/>I thought I saw something, but hell, I don't know. It may be right there. <br/>We were so elated the ride back in the canoe, we were just  loving life and couldn't wait to see the new beach. And all this to happen, we're just crushed right now. And we don't have the water, we don't have the flint to start a  fire to boil the water and purify it. We lost everything we won today. We're in a worse scenario than we originally had. <br/>We lost to the challenge, and we lost pretty hard. The other tribe outplayed us and outwitted us completely. You know what, we didn't make smart decisions. They were smart, they took just the fire. <br/>The coconuts will sustain us for 39 days if we had to. So understand that-- I'm not going to allow anyone to be  negative. <br/>Nobody needs to be negative. <br/>Okay. No, no, about, "Oh, we don't have this. We got everything we need."  I know how things work. I'm not the strongest person. You know, people are gonna choose who doesn't fit into this and  who they think is a weak link. So I definitely think that I am a target. <br/>But when it comes to challenges, physically, I know I'm  stronger than most of their dudes. Well, let's keep on what we was doing. We're gonna do Angie...  Right. We're gonna do Angie. But we got to get the other guys to go in on it. I want to go talk to Stephenie, 'cause we have issues. If we have issues, we need to work them out. <br/>My vote will be for Angie not because I don't like her,  but she is a person that must be voted off in order for our team to be as  strong as it can be. <br/>So you think Angie. <br/>I think we need to keep the men. I think it's absolutely...  We're keeping the men. We can't lose any of our guys. Which, I mean, seriously, I mean, I-I could be voted off. I don't want to be voted off. I think the team needs me. <br/>We need your strength. But I do have to say, we should've left earlier. Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right. I know that you're just a complete go-getter, and that's why you  want us to get everything, and I understand that. So I guess Angie. <br/>Okay. <br/>Okay. You, too. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Okay. Nervous as hell about Tribal. Wish I wasn't going tonight. We made a dumb mistake, and I don't think we should be going  tonight. But we are, and it's because of one person, I feel. The only reason we lost the challenge 'cause we didn't leave  soon enough. <br/>We didn't leave soon enough. <br/>She wanted everything. I don't think we need to get rid of her. I'm not gonna vote for her. Stephenie's thinking that Jolanda's the reason we lost the  challenge. But that woman's got a lot, a lot of strength. I think she can still help us out. I haven't seen where she's hurting us just yet. <br/>Who do you want to vote for? <br/>I think Angie right now. <br/>She's not fit? <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>All right. Well, I don't know, I'm sorry. [ laughs ]  No, that's good, that's good. <br/>I'll go with you. <br/>Okay, news flash, news flash. This is something that I noticed. For every two hours, that we work, we're gonna rest for at least  an hour, okay? It is time for us to get focused, kick butt and take names. <br/>Jolanda is a strong personality. She is not a team player. I didn't know that that's how you guys felt. <br/>Right. <br/>I thought I was the only one. Are you down with that? Are you in? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Because I'll be pissed if everybody changes their mind. I mean, I'll hold it against you for life. <br/>Now she says, "We're voting out Jo. Are you in?" I was, like, "Hell, yeah, I'm in."  Like, I'm thinking I'm the one out, like I know how today went. You don't think I remember exactly the order in which we got  picked for tribes? I don't trust anyone in this tribe. But if I can at least make it past this one, I'll be happy. <br/>Probst: Behind each of you I'll be happy. <br/>Probst: Behind each of you I'll be happy. <br/>Probst: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch. Approach a flame, dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council. In this game, fire represents your life. As long as you have fire, you're still in the game. When your fire's gone, so are you. Have a seat. Well, welcome to your first Tribal Council. I know you don't want to be here. Stephenie, what's been the biggest surprise first three days? <br/>Biggest surprise? Oh, God. Starving, we can't get fire, we're so thirsty. We were together as one, and now we're separated, we've formed  bonds and now they're gone, and we don't know what's coming next. It's been really tough. <br/>Probst: James. Happy with this tribe? <br/>I am. This is a damn fine tribe. Everybody in here is tough, they're young, they got a lot of  energy, lot of testosterone. We gonna win some matches. We just didn't do it today. <br/>Probst: Jeff, let's talk about the strategy of today's  challenge, because it was about making a choice. And it seems as though you guys have a very strong tribe, but it  was brains that beat you today. Would you agree? <br/>Yeah. We've got the strength, we all have the endurance. There was just a couple key times that we just messed up, and,  you know, we lost time trying to get everything we possibly could and get  running with it, and... it wasn't gonna happen. <br/>Probst: So, James, let me be clear. You didn't even bring fire. Oh, hell, no. We should've. You did not take fire? <br/>Dumb-ass. <br/>Well, we tried to get it, but it was last, and then when  we realized that we just lost a tremendous amount of time, we just said,  okay, just take the other stuff. <br/>Probst: Ashlee, is there a leader on this tribe yet? <br/>Jeff, I think that is... the only thing that's holding  this group back, is that we have yet to come together as a group and decide  who is gonna lead our group right now. <br/>Probst: Jolanda, can this group lead itself... as a group? <br/>Uh, no. We need somebody to make a unilateral decision. I mean, I would like, if I could, to help lead the team. But I also know that I have a very strong personality. So, that's been my biggest dilemma, because I don't want for  people to say, "Oh, you know, "her personality's too strong, she's  bossy, she's a... a witch."  Probst: Angie, picked last, tribe welcomes you, but now  here we are at Tribal Council, and you were still picked last. <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: How heavy is that weighing on your mind? Or have you overcome that? <br/>It weighs very heavy on my mind. I mean, it's hard being picked last. But I think that I tried really, really hard at the challenge  today, but I think definitely, my head was gonna be on the chopping block. You know, either there's some things going on where somebody has  somebody else in mind, or it's just... it's gonna overwhelmingly be me,  so...  Probst: We'll find out. It is time to vote. Jolanda, you're up. <br/>Um, Angie, I just don't think that we can be happy with  losses. We've got to evaluate and move forward. <br/>[ whispers ]: It's nothing personal, but it's either you  or I, and I don't want it to be me. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote. Angie. Jolanda-- one vote Angie, one vote Jolanda. Angie-- two votes Angie, one vote Jolanda. Angie. That's three votes Angie, one vote Jolanda. Jolanda. Three votes Angie, two votes Jolanda. Jolanda. We're tied: three votes Angie, three votes Jolanda. That's four votes Jolanda. First person voted out of Survivor: Palau-- Jolanda. That's five votes, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Good luck, you guys. Watch the way. <br/>Probst: Jolanda, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Well, if there's one thing It's time for you to go. Well, if there's one thing you should take away from tonight's  Tribal Council, it should be this: You need to stop with the excuses and get  a plan, or you will be back here very soon. You're not gonna be going back to camp with fire; you're gonna  earn that on your own. Go back to camp. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor... [ woman screams ]  Oh, my God, there were three! [ thunderclap ]  Oh, no! <br/>Probst: ...Koror questions the move to the new beach. <br/>Do you think there could be a worse island than this? <br/>Probst: At Ulong, Jeff and Kim get cozy, and the search  for flint intensifies. <br/>Fire is the only thing that matters. <br/>I played this game, and I don't think that I would do  anything differently. I mean, I am the oldest, and I think differently than my tribe. They are a lot more happy-go-lucky than I am, but that's fine,  because this was a great adventure, and it's an experience that I think  everyone should try, and I don't regret anything that happened out here.
