<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor... Here in Samoa, the purple tribe, Galu,  has been on a roll... Galu wins! ...winning all three immunity challenges. At camp, most of the tribe kicked back and relaxed, while Shambo did most of  the work. <br/>I'm not doing the warm and fuzzy. I'm doing the Rambo-Shambo provider role out here. <br/>Probst: In a twist, Shambo was sent to observe the other tribe. <br/>We call you McDreamy. <br/>Pleasure. <br/>Probst: And she immediately bonded with everyone. At Foa Foa, Russell was a force to be reckoned with. <br/>I'm running this whole show right now. <br/>Probst: He constantly manipulated the others to further his own ends. <br/>I'm going to have them all under control like zombies walking around. <br/>Probst: As the yellow tribe was preparing to go to their third Tribal Council  in a row...  He was...  If I was a girl, I would slap you, is what I would do. <br/>Probst: ...Jaison got furious at Ben because of his at Ben because of his  racially-insensitive comments. racially-insensitive comments. <br/>Probst: Jaison wanted Ben out, but Russell didn't agree. <br/>Right now, I think I need Ben. Ben. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Cou  Probst: At Tribal Cou Ben wouldn't back down. <br/>She is from the ghetto, and she's trashy. That's ghetto trash. That's not racial. <br/>Probst: So Jaison stood up to him. <br/>If what you're telling me is that what you said had absolutely no racial  context, then maybe you areignorant. <br/>Probst: During the confrontation, Russell realized his best play was to vote  off Ben. <br/>I didn't want to have to do this, man. <br/>Probst: Ben became the fourth member of Foa Foa to leave the game. Now the tribe is down in numbers and morale. 16 are left. 16 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Yeah. <br/>What happened at Tribal Council was me trying to let Ben know how I felt. I cannot handle people who use terms and phrases that are meant terms and  phrases that are meant to hurt on a very basic level. to hurt on a very basic level. <br/>Jaison, there's room here, too. <br/>Man! I'm hungry, and I'm tired. I came here to have an adventure, but, frankly, I, right now, believe that  coming here was the worst decision I've here was the worst decision I've made  in my entire life. made in my entire life. <br/>It's draining, man. It's not only physically tough. It's mentally tough. It messes with your mind, your body and your soul. Coming back from Tribal last night, Jaison was really upset with Ben. You know, he took things very personal. I really think that if Ben would have stayed, Jaison would have quit the game. quit the game. Now, what kind of man is that? Now, what kind of man is that? <br/>Yeah, dude. <br/>Yeah, dude. <br/>Yeah? <br/>Yeah? <br/>Now I'm willing to get rid of Jaison, and whoever I want to be gone is going  to be gone. I've got it all under my thumb right now. right now. <br/>I got back at Galu last night, and I'm not happy, because when I went over to  Foa Foa, there was a huge appreciation for Shambo, huge appreciation. Their camp is amazing, you guys. Fresh water, white sand beaches. No coral, you can go barefoot. Everybody over there loved me. I feel ten times closer to Foa Foa than I do Galu, because Galu-- they just  want to lay on the beach and gossip. So, I don't have no problem going to Foa Foa, because I already have a  following there, and if I can make it to the merge, I know damn well I've got  merge, I know damn well I've got their vote, so I'm way ahead. their vote, so I'm way ahead. <br/>Yas got a clue for the immunity idol. <br/>Okay. <br/>You got a clue for the immunity idol. <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Wherever the immunity idol is on their beach, it's probably on our beach. Nobody really got to talk to Shambo last night about the second clue to the  immunity idol, right? So I come up with this little idea to find out all the information I want to  get from her. [Shambo sighs] If I can find the immunity idol, I can give it to you if  you're in danger. <br/>Yup. <br/>At least you'll have that. I'm, like, 30 seconds away from nailing all the information I want to get  from her, and here comes John, and he stops, and, like, "Hey,  Shambo." Like he has this brilliant idea. <br/>You got a clue, and Yasmin had a clue. <br/>I got her clue and my clue. <br/>What was Yasmin's clue? <br/>Yasmin's clue was, "You'll find what you seek in the bark." And the  second one is, "It's low to the ground." Those were the exact words. If it comes down to jury trial, you guys better give me the vote for giving  you honesty on this question. <br/>Well, listen, if um... If we can...  And if you don't, bad on you. Got to go. I don't feel like I've hurt myself in the game in any way, shape, or form by  sharing knowledge with them. That can do nothing but help me going forward. And-And maybe it won't. Maybe it will hurt me, but we'll see. we'll see. <br/>Tree mail. <br/>Tree mail. <br/>Uh-oh. <br/>And it says, "The chief must choose two to join him on a quest to go on  a special mission which could turn out for the best. And when your chief comes home..."  Oh! <br/>"...your tribe might have more to eat..."  Oh! <br/>"...but you won't know why until the mission is complete."  Basically, they just want one guy, one girl. We just got some tree mail, and it says that I need to choose two people to  go on a mission, which may or may not lead to us having a little bit more  food. Obviously, you want to bring people that are strong in some sort of challenge  situation. So I'll be taking Russell, because he is good at strategizing, and Natalie is  good with puzzles, things of that nature. So I thought it was perfect. Everybody's comfortable with this? <br/>That's fine, yup. <br/>Yup, yup. <br/>Yup, yup. <br/>Let's do this. <br/>Let's do this. <br/>Have to choose two people to go on a quest with me, so I took Shambo and Dave  because I need some-some brains and some firepower. firepower. Here comes Foa Foa. Here comes Foa Foa. <br/>So we're just sitting there looking at each other. You know, we're waiting for Jeff, 'cause at every challenge so far, Jeff has  always been there. So we're, like, what do we do? <br/>So what's going on? <br/>I don't know. <br/>Let's lay an egg. [indistinct chatter]  Oh, my word. <br/>Oh, chickens. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Who knows what's in the other one. <br/>Nah. It's probably rice and beans. <br/>Oh, if you catch the chicken, you get the pirate chest full of food. Ha, ha. <br/>Maybe so. <br/>I don't think that's what it is. <br/>Some kind of swap? <br/>I think so, too. <br/>I wonder if we're just supposed to jump, like just get over there and start  doing stuff without even asking. stuff without even asking. [clucking] [clucking]  Wait. <br/>A reward challenge. "For today's challenge, you'll be left on your own to battle for reward  inside this box... " Suddenly, it was on. The frenzy was on. Shambo's grabbing chickens, we're jumping into the treasure box, and it's got  all these colored balls, and it's got some instructions. <br/>Oh, all right, Sham, the reward cannot be opened and-and shared between  tribes... Sham, put those chickens back and come on back. <br/>Hey, put the chicken back, quick. <br/>Take 'em back. Take' em back. Take them chickens back. <br/>Okay, so what is the deal? <br/>Uh... "For today's challenge, you will be left on your own to battle for  reward. Inside this box are a flag and three tribe-colored balls for each player. One player will place the flag in the center of the beach. One at a time, you will toss a ball toward the flag. The object is to land your ball closest to the flag. Once all the balls have been thrown, the ball closest to the flag wins."   Boccie ball. <br/>It's like boccie ball. <br/>It's boccie ball, horseshoes. <br/>All right. Oh, reward challenge. Awesome! It's basically like a game of boccie ball. The tribe that wins gets to take these chickens home. <br/>So, we'll start with the chiefs, so you start first. <br/>All right. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Then I'll start. <br/>Chiefs first, ladies second...  Chiefs first. <br/>And the esteemed gentleman...  Yeah, that's fine. <br/>All right, cheers. <br/>All right. <br/>All right, let's do this. <br/>All right. <br/>Let's go, Mick. Oh, good shot, Mick. <br/>Good job, Mick. Good job. You got this one, chief. <br/>That was a good one, too. Ah! <br/>Mm. <br/>So close. <br/>Wow. <br/>Yes! <br/>Oh, son of a...  Yes! <br/>Oh, God. <br/>Russell's ball knocks mine closest, and I can taste the chicken in my mouth. <br/>Wow. <br/>Good shot, Mick. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Stay out of his way now. Make sure you don't hit it. <br/>Mick had thrown those last two balls so close to the stick. My goal was to, like, not even get close to him, because I didn't want to  mess anything up. Oh, no. Sorry, guys. <br/>Nice. <br/>Aah! <br/>All right, you're up. <br/>I'm going to knock him out of there. <br/>Get one in. <br/>Mm. <br/>Mm. <br/>Oop. Too strong. <br/>Oop. Too strong. <br/>Aim right for that stick. <br/>Oh, my God, I'm a mess. <br/>Try knocking his out. <br/>That's what I'm going for. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>There we go. <br/>Nice! <br/>Nice hit. [grunting]  Oh, Shannon Lee. Lord have mercy. <br/>We're panicking all over the place. Shambo was, like, no good. <br/>Dang! <br/>So now it's between Russell from Foa Foa and Dave. And each has three shots to win this game. <br/>All right, Russell, we need  All right, Russell, we need you. you. <br/>Good job, Russell. <br/>Good job, Russell. <br/>All right, you're up, Dave. <br/>All right, you're up, Dave. <br/>All right, you're up, Dave. Not bad, not bad. Not bad, not bad. <br/>Ooh...  Gosh. <br/>Ooh. <br/>Yes, that puts two in the way. <br/>All right, Russell, nice and easy. <br/>Don't knock anything out. You got it, man, you got it. <br/>Ooh...  Dear God. <br/>Nice shooting, Tex. <br/>That might get it done, so you're gonna have to get at the stick. <br/>Just drop it on it. <br/>All right. <br/>So, Dave's got his final ball. We've got the closest ball to the flag. I'm looking over at the chickens like I'm stoked. This is finally gonna be something we can bring back. We're finally gonna win. <br/>Come on, Dave, you can do it. <br/>All right, so this one wins, Dave. <br/>Shh. The last ball-- it is on me. Make it or break it. 'Cause at this point, we are not going home with the chickens. going home with the chickens. <br/>Oh, no. <br/>Oh, no. [several shouting]  Oh, my God! <br/>Yes! <br/>Yes! [both grunt] Good game. <br/>Good game, guys. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Good shot. <br/>Thank you, man. Thank you very much. <br/>Oh, man. It's so demoralizing. I'm just so tired of losing to these guys. It totally split me in half to see Galu walk off with those chickens. It's so ludicrous that we can't even pull off frickin' boccie even pull off  frickin' boccie ball. ball. ball. <br/>Thank goodness Russell didn't take me to the challenge today, because now  with him gone, I can get people doing things, working for the tribe, while I  stay home for the tribe, while I stay home and find that immunity idol. and find that immunity idol. <br/>I got ten minutes to try to find an idol that apparently is in the bark of a  tree. in the bark of a tree. [grunts] [grunts] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes! Yes! [whispers]: Oh, it's so beautiful. beautiful. [exhales] [exhales] Of course, I'm not gonna tell anybody I got the idol, but  I'm gonna use it down the road. Maybe around day 30, 36. 'Cause I plan on being here for a while, and this is gonna be my ticket. <br/>You're the man, dude. You brought it on home. <br/>Hey, man, it was your ball I hit-- team effort, Daddy. Seriously. <br/>I'll tell you, the chickens, they're heavy, but they're worth every aching  muscle. Carrying that chicken coop felt great coming home. Every time it scraped against the back of my ankles, I thought, "That's  okay, we're bringing home the bacon, baby." Do you know anything about  chickens, Shannon? <br/>We need somebody who isn't gonna accidentally let them out. <br/>Yeah. We're back! <br/>You're home?! <br/>We won the challenge! <br/>You did?! <br/>We come bearing gifts! <br/>It's Russell! <br/>We're bringing friends! We're gonna have eggs every morning! [happy shouts, laughing]  We won! <br/>Yeah! <br/>We won! We won! <br/>I won chickens. On the inside... We win! We win! Yes! However, I'm just trying to stay emotionally centered and humble within the  tribe. 'Cause getting cocky is a quick way to show me the door. <br/>Come on, guys, over here! Come on! <br/>However, I won chickens. What did youdo? Not that. Peace. <br/>All right, so this is Daisy, Ella and Millie. "We lay eggs and like to eat coconut."  And they got to have fresh water all the time. <br/>Hey, you're on it. I've already assigned it to you. <br/>I don't claim to be a chicken farmer, but I was introduced to them at a very  young age, and you got to have a relationship with chickens. They're very finicky, they have to trust you, they have to know you, they  have to like you. The Survivorchickens will know Shambo, and they will give me eggs in turn,  because I will be kind to them. [Shambo clucking] [chickens clucking] [chickens clucking] [Shambo clucking]  [Shambo clucking] [Shambo clucking]  Talking chicken. <br/>Talking chicken. [clucking] [thunder crashes] [thunder crashes]  Mick and Natalie and Russ, they lost the challenge. I think normally I'd say I was hungry for a win, but I just want to survive  to another day. I'm tired. I'm hungry. You know? I'm really thirsty. So for me right now, it doesn't So for me right now, it doesn't really matter. really matter. <br/>My true alliance, it changes all the time. I told Jaison I'd bring him to the top two. But I don't know that I can count on Jaison to stay in the game. I need somebody to be able to help me to the final two. So I would have to take somebody like Natalie with me. Because she's gonna ride my coattails the whole way. I mean, she's too stupid to do it by herself. She needs me. So I could stand up there and say, "She followed my coattails this whole  way. She rode me like a horse." She rode me like a horse." [laughs]  [laughs]  Day one still exists. It's gonna be me and you in the final. <br/>That's right. <br/>You're probably gonna get upset and you're probably gonna cry, 'cause your  friends are gonna get their hearts broken and you're gonna be one of the ones  doing it to 'em. <br/>Russell and I have talked about, since the first day, about being the final  two at the end, so at this point, I'm kind of his wingman, I guess you could  say. <br/>You're good... you're good for a long while. <br/>I definitely think people underestimate me, and I want them to think that,  hey, it's really smart for them to take me to the end because they can beat  me. You know, use that to my advantage. And if it comes down to me or him, 'cause I know I can beat Russell in the  very end, 'cause I would say a lot of other people in the tribe have really  been rubbed the wrong way by him. So I'm just trying to not ruffle feathers, steer clear, build good  relationships, which build good relationships, which is what I'm good at. is what I'm good at. is what I'm good at. [chickens clucking] [chickens clucking] [chickens clucking] [Shambo clucking]  [Shambo clucking]  Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Escaped chicken, escaped chicken. chicken. 9-1-1. 9-1-1. <br/>We're all kind of just talking about that. Everybody's so hungry. And we hear this, "Escaped chicken! Emergency! Escaped chicken!" And sure enough, Shambo let a chicken get away. So her and Erik, they're running around chasing it, and it's, like,  Tweedledee and Tweedledum. [chickens clucking] [chickens clucking] [squawking] [squawking]  Erik, he's running after the chicken, and he gets clotheslined... by the  clothesline. clothesline. It was pure comedy right there. It was pure comedy right there. <br/>Lynelle... Come here, chicky, chicky. [squawking] [squawking] [clucking] [clucking]  Damn it. I didn't know they could frickin' fly. <br/>I'm not calling Shambo stupid, but it's a bird, for crying out loud. I would think you being a country girl would assume that something with wings  can fly. So yeah, I was just beyond... just, I was stunned. <br/>I don't know where she went. <br/>All you have to do is look at the chicken. <br/>I said I don't know where she went-- I'm looking. <br/>She's right there. <br/>Holy crap. <br/>It's up in the tree. She's so high up that...  There's a chicken in a tree? <br/>One of ourchickens? <br/>I'll give you one guess. <br/>Why? Why...  Shambo was feeding it. <br/>Bingo. <br/>Dude, can I just get a break? I produce one egg, and then I let a chicken get away. <br/>Yep. [Shambo clucking] Shambo thinks that she's gonna get the chicken out of the  tree by clucking at it. Shambo tells me, "Oh, I feel really bad, but at least I produced an  egg." You didn't produce an egg. The chicken laid an egg. What did you do to produce the egg, Shambo? And nobody cares. That's the worst part. Is anybody looking for the damn chicken? No. chicken? No. That's just great. That's just great. <br/>Every time I try to take a  Every time I try to take a nap, Erik interrupts me. nap, Erik interrupts me. <br/>Uh-uh. <br/>Ugh! Hmm. All right, I'll be back. <br/>Bye. I am so sick of Yas doing absolutely nothing. She's, like, waiting around to be taken care of like she's a little princess,  so she's kind little princess, so she's kind of frustrating and annoying. of frustrating and annoying. I think the reason our tribe is working so well is because we are really  focusing on bringing our team as strong as possible to the merge. But Yas is here for herself. She's not a team player. She doesn't help out around camp. And say we do lose a challenge. I think Yas would be the first I think Yas would be the first to go. to go. to go. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Galu getting your first look at the new Foa Foa. Ben voted out at the last Tribal Council. All right, you guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: First things first. Brett, take back the immunity idol. idol. Thank you. Thank you. Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will race across a net run carrying wooden blocks. When you reach the platform, you must stack the blocks one on top of the  other. Once you've completed the stack, you'll make your way across a rope bridge to  another platform where you will find more blocks. This will stack even higher. The first tribe to get both stacks completed wins immunity, is safe from the  vote. Losers-- Tribal Council, where somebody will be voted out of this game. Galu, you have four extra members-- sitting four people out this challenge. Who is it going to be? <br/>I'm going to sit out Sham, Laura, Dave and myself. <br/>Probst: All right, you guys take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize, and we'll minute to  strategize, and we'll get started. get started. Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready? Go! John out quickly for Galu. Liz out for Foa Foa. Got to make your way across the net run with all of your blocks. Everybody doing very well. [whooping] Once all your members are back on the mat, you can start stacking. We are dead even. Go! <br/>I got some big ones. I got some big ones. Here. <br/>Probst: You're building one tall stack. One block on top of another. Foa Foa working quickly. Using the height of Jaison. Galu starting to use a little human pyramid action. <br/>Get on my back. <br/>Probst: That's thinking. That's teamwork. Monica now getting up on Erik's shoulders. <br/>Come on, Monica. <br/>Probst: Can Galu make it work? Foa Foa very close. Once you have it, get back to your mat. <br/>Let it go. <br/>Probst: Monica, Kelly working together. It's got to be there for a count of five. One, two...  We got you. <br/>Probst: Three, four. <br/>Go. <br/>Probst: Five. Galu, go! Foa Foa, one, two, three, four, five. Go! <br/>Come on, John! <br/>You're way ahead. Take your time. <br/>Go, John! Go, John! <br/>Stay on the rope, John. You can do it! <br/>Keep going, keep going, keep going! <br/>Let's go! <br/>Probst: John across the rope bridge quickly for Galu. Go! Yasmin on the rope bridge for Galu. <br/>Go, Yasmin. You got it, girl. Push it! <br/>Probst: John got across very quickly. Jaison taking a lot more time. Liz now on the course. <br/>Good job, Yasmin. <br/>Probst: Yasmin extending Galu's lead. <br/>All right, Yas! <br/>Probst: Erik now on the rope bridge for Galu. <br/>Get across that rope, baby! <br/>Come on, Liz. Liz, you can do this! <br/>Come on, Liz, keep it up. Keep it up. <br/>Good job, Liz. <br/>Probst: Mick on the course now for Foa Foa. Erik cruising through this, no problem at all. Monica on the course for Galu. <br/>Let's go, Mo! <br/>Probst: Foa Foa needs to make up some time. Galu with a big lead. <br/>Come on, Monica, you got it. <br/>Come on, Monica! Come on, Monica! <br/>Go, Mick! <br/>Probst: Foa, go! Natalie on the course for Foa Foa. <br/>Come on, Monica! Get up there! <br/>Probst: Monica is taking a long time for Galu. <br/>Come on! Come on! <br/>Keep going! Hurry, baby, hurry! [indistinct chatter] [Monica panting]  Probst: Natalie is making up the lost time. Suddenly, it's very close again. <br/>Come on, Monica! <br/>Come on, come on! <br/>Probst: Every second counts in this challenge. <br/>Come on, come on! <br/>Damn! <br/>Probst: Galu, go! Foa Foa, go! <br/>Kelly on course for Galu. Ashley on the course for Foa Foa. Ashley is screaming across this rope bridge. <br/>Come on, Kelly! Come on, Kelly! <br/>Come on, Kelly, you can do this! <br/>Probst: Galu, go! <br/>Brett, bring it on! <br/>Let's go, Ashley. Let's go, Ashley. <br/>Probst: We're down to the last two members. Brett for Galu, Russell for Foa Foa. Look at Russell go. <br/>Yeah, Russell! <br/>Probst: Russell may pass Brett. <br/>Come on, Brett! Come on, Brett! <br/>You can do it, Brett! You can do it, Brett! <br/>Probst: We are very close. <br/>Go, Brett, go! <br/>Probst: Russell making up a lot of time. Got to get everybody on the mat. <br/>We got this. We got this. <br/>Probst: Go, Galu! Go, Foa Foa! <br/>Oh! Come on! Come on! [overlapping chatter]  Probst: You've got to untie these and then stack them just like you did with  the other stack. We are neck and neck. Great competition on the rope bridge. Foa Foa made up a lot of time. <br/>What's up? What's up? Bring it over. Just bring it back over. <br/>Probst: Galu has their first bag untied. They're going to start working on their stack. Galu has their second bag untied. Foa Foa-- still not untied. Once again, Galu with the lead. Looking to win their fourth straight immunity challenge. <br/>Come on, come on, take your time. <br/>You're smokin' them! You're smokin' them! <br/>Probst: Foa Foa has their first bag untied. This stack will be a lot higher. <br/>On my shoulder, not on my back, Kelly. On my shoulder, not on my back. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa has their second bag undone. Both tribes now working on their stack. <br/>Get it up there guys. <br/>Legs locked. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa picking up the pace now. Natalie getting on Jaison. Big height advantage. We're very close. Big, big immunity on the line. <br/>You guys can see my face, right? <br/>Worry about stacking right now. <br/>Probst: Natalie going to stand up now. <br/>Y'all, help me, help me-- all three at the same time. <br/>All three at the same time. <br/>All three at the same time. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa desperately wants a win. Foa Foa loses, they will be down to five members. Galu with their last three blocks. Kelly has them. <br/>Easy, easy. <br/>Probst: Natalie with the last block for Foa Foa. <br/>Push up a little bit. <br/>No, I can't reach it. <br/>Hurry, you guys. They're...  Probst: Kelly loses two blocks. <br/>Almost there. <br/>No, no, no, no! <br/>Natalie, you've got it...  Probst: Natalie places it for Foa Foa! Do they have it? [indistinct chatter]  Probst: One, two, three, four, five! Foa Foa wins their first immunity challenge! [cheering and whooping]  Yes! <br/>Everybody keep their head held high, head held high. <br/>Probst: Foa Foa, congratulations. Who wants it? Everybody wants it. For the first time in this game, Foa Foa will not be going to Tribal Council. Enjoy the night off. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Congratulations. [thunder rumbles] Well, I don't know if Mother Nature is sending you guys a  sign or not, but there's a big cloud over your head right now. Should be an interesting afternoon figuring out who's going home. Grab your stuff. I will see you at Tribal. [thunder crackling]  I saw Monica basically disappear at that challenge. This is Survivor. This is about physical, mental toughness. And today, Monica just did not And today, Monica just did not have it. have it. <br/>All right, so, I'm going to try and get this fire started, and we will, uh,  keep movin' and groovin' until it's time to do what we got to do. Today, we lost our first immunity challenge, and I just got pissed off. That there was no reason why we should have lost. We had the lead the whole time, and then I kind of saw one person kind of  fall apart, and that was Monica. that was Monica. [sighs] [sighs]  In terms of the challenge, Monica screwed that up. There's no question in my mind. <br/>She was terrible. <br/>She was terrible. She's a young girl, hanging out, having a good time. It's like it's like Club Med or something. something. As much as I hate to do that. As much as I hate to do that. As much as I hate to do that. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>What are we going to do about the vote tonight? <br/>I don't know. <br/>Well, I don't know. <br/>Well, I'd say that Sham's colossal screwups are kind of a shot to team morale. <br/>Are they? <br/>Well, I mean...  Well, I mean...  They're nonstop. <br/>They're nonstop. <br/>You know what I mean? <br/>I think she does the least out of everyone here. <br/>Yup, exactly. <br/>Is that where we're going-- with Yas? <br/>I mean, that's...  As far as I'm concerned, Yas goes. <br/>We are going to our first Tribal Council tonight. Some names are going about. For instance, Yas doesn't really do anything. She basically sits by the fire and kind of observes things. So that kind of gets annoying. So I think Yas might be going home tonight. But, hey, it is Survivor. But, hey, it is Survivor. Crazier things have happened. Crazier things have happened. <br/>You want to vote Monica out? She took about 200% longer than anybody to run that rope. <br/>Me and John was across that rope first and fast. <br/>Right. <br/>So, that's why I'm saying I can't worry about it, because I don't want the  negativity. <br/>Exactly. <br/>Whatever's going to happen is going to happen. <br/>See, that's how I am. <br/>I know I haven't came up short. I'm sorry. <br/>Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. <br/>You know what I'm saying? And around this camp, I ain't stepping up to do nothing because you know what  these people do-- they prey on you doing something wrong, like letting the  chicken go. They prey on that. <br/>Yeah? <br/>See, so therefore, nobody will be preying on me. I've had my game face on since day one. I'm here to play. And I did just that. I've been running with the fellas and helping us win our challenges, and I'm  not looking down on nobody. But, you know, Monica didn't help us win today. So if you want to penalize me for stepping up, then so be it. Vote me out, because my body Vote me out, because my body could use a rest,  damn it. could use a rest, damn it. <br/>Russ, to me, sounds dead set on Monica. <br/>I don't know. I mean, I like Monica. I mean, I like Monica. You know what I mean? Like... You know what I mean? Like...  There's a ton of crazy talk about voting Yas tonight. True, she doesn't do a lot of work around here, but Yas is completely  stronger in challenges than Monica. Unfortunately, people seem to be rallying behind Monica, and I don't know how  that's gonna play out. <br/>If you decide to go away from Monica, then you're gonna vote against your  leader. Which we could do, because we have numbers, but I don't want to be on Russ's  bad side. <br/>I am not in the mood to mess  I am not in the mood to mess with Russell. with Russell. <br/>Really? <br/>I'm telling you, because...  So these people who are gonna vote for Yas, they basically already have an  alliance, basically. <br/>Well, I don't know if it's an alliance as much as it is, like, a decision  that maybe they don't trust...  Well, they don't trust me. You know what I mean? That's what it comes down to. <br/>Boss? <br/>Boss? <br/>All right...  All right... Yasmin, that's a vote that I absolutely disagree with. Every time there was a challenge, Yasmin kicked it out. challenge, Yasmin kicked it out. Today Monica dragged her butt. Today Monica dragged her butt. Today Monica dragged her butt. And right now... And right now... That's it. I want the strongest tribe, and I'm the leader, so these people, they got to  listen to me, or there's gonna be some serious ass-kicking. ass-kicking. <br/>Probst: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch. Approach a flame. Approach a flame. Dip it in and get fire. Dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council, because in this game, fire  represents your life. As long as you have fire, you're still in the game. When your fire's gone, so are you. And that will be the case for one of you tonight. Galu gonna vote out your first member. Shambo, interesting afternoon knowing you had to come to Tribal tonight? <br/>Yeah, everybody was a little uneasy, and there was people going for walks on  the beach, there was a little bit of whispering going on, and... it's not  good. We don't want to be here. We're bummed, all of us. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about camp life. Brett, do you think everybody's pulling equal share of the weight? <br/>Uh, there's definitely people that are pulling more weight than they should,  and there's also other people, uh, Yasmin, that are, you know, maybe doing a  little bit less work. <br/>Probst: Yasmin, you're already rolling your eyes. <br/>I wasn't rolling my eyes, but if you want my opinion next, I'll be happy to  give it. <br/>Probst: Sure. <br/>Well, I find that a bit of a surprise. As a matter of fact, anything somebody has asked me to do, I have did it. So I don't see how he figure I could be doing more. I felt like that's the conversation him and I could've had beforehand, and I  would've stepped it up. Because I have not shied away from any work. And maybe I don't belong in a jungle because I have on heels, but I wanted to  dress up for you, Jeff, so I thought, you know, that I'd look a little, you  know, nice or whatever, so...  Probst: Mission accomplished. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about challenges. Russell, how important are challenges in this game right now? <br/>I mean, for me, challenges are your base. 'Cause if the base isn't there, everything topples. So get the challenges done, the rest falls into place. <br/>Probst: Yasmin, you're shaking your head in agreement. <br/>I'm very competitive at heart. I just always like to step up, 'cause, damn it, I like to compete. So I totally agree with Russell, 101%. <br/>Probst: So based on what you said, who could've given more at today's  challenge? <br/>Today, Monica struggled. That's just the way that I see it. <br/>Probst: Monica, what do you do when you hear your name as somebody who might  have blown the challenge that put you here? <br/>It sucks. I mean, especially for me, I think I did a great job at the challenge today. I mean, getting on the rope originally, I had to kind of get my bearings, but  once I got past that, I think I really came back to my normal self. <br/>Probst: So, Dave, you can go camp life, you can go challenges, or you can go  individual strategy. The problem with that is if you start making big moves too soon, you will  destroy your tribe and it's only a matter of time before you're gone. <br/>Uh, I think, ultimately, what's good for the tribe is good for me, and so  that's what I'm basing my vote on. <br/>Probst: Laura, do you agree with that? <br/>Number one for me is who's really helping around the camp the most. <br/>Probst: All right, well, it sounds like there are a couple of different  philosophies about how the vote should go tonight. Let's see which one wins out. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Erik, you're up. Erik, you're up. <br/>[whispering]: I don't feel like you have carried your weight around camp,  despite what weight around camp, despite what you say. you say. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... First vote... Yasmin. Yasmin. Yasmin. Yasmin. Two votes Yasmin. Two votes Yasmin. Monica. That's two votes Yasmin, one vote Monica. Monica. Monica. Two votes Monica. Two votes Monica. Yas. That's three votes Yasmin, two That's three votes Yasmin, two votes Monica. votes Monica. Yasmin. That's four votes Yasmin, two That's four votes Yasmin, two votes Monica. votes Monica. <br/>That's five votes Yasmin, two  That's five votes Yasmin, two votes Monica. votes Monica. <br/>Fourth person voted out of Survivor: Samoa,Yasmin. That's six votes; that's enough. That's six votes; that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Yasmin, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. Well, not only did you lose a tribe member, you guys lost momentum. Question is, can you get it back? Grab your stuff, head back to camp. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor. Maybe the worst thing out here. [disgusted groans]  ...black clouds scare me. [thunder crashes]  I have never in my life been this cold. <br/>All our blankets are wet. There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide. <br/>You are lying to me. <br/>Let me tell you, you're walking on thin ice. <br/>Probst: Liz struggling to  Probst: Liz struggling to hang on. hang on. <br/>I personally feel like I'm such a strong competitor that had I made it to the  end, it would've been really hard not to vote for me. These people are going to start to scramble, because they're not being true  to themselves. They're tiptoeing around each other, they're full of crap-- it's just crazy. But you know what, if that's the type of company I have to keep, type of  company I have to keep, I'm happy to be going.
