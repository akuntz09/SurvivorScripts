<br/>Jeff Probst: 36 days ago, in ultramodern Shanghai, 16 Americans began the  adventure of a lifetime. They were transported back in time to a remote region on the shore of the  Lake of a Thousand shore of the Lake of a Thousand Islands. Islands. They were divided into two tribes. Yellow tribe, your name is Zhan Hu. Red tribe, your name is Fei Long. The Fei Long Tribe quickly established themselves as hard[1]working  and strategic. <br/>We need a commander. <br/>I think I can do it. <br/>Probst: And on day one, an important alliance was formed between Todd and  Amanda. <br/>I will stick with you because you know this game. <br/>You're my loyal alliance too. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: The Zhan Hu tribe was hopelessly disorganized, and when they weren't goofing  off, they argued. <br/>Back up off me. <br/>Would you please...  Back up off me! <br/>Probst: Their lack of cohesiveness seemed to affect their performance in the  challenge. Zhan Hu getting nowhere with the puzzle. Fei Long wins immunity! After losing the first immunity challenge, Zhan Hu sent Chicken home. <br/>Damn! <br/>Probst: On day four, at the first reward challenge... Fei Long wins! ...a new twist was revealed. Fei Long, because you defeated Zhan Hu, you now get to kidnap one member of  their tribe. The kidnapped person was given a clue to the location of a hidden immunity  idol. <br/>"You must give this sealed clue to a member of the tribe before you  rejoin your own tribe."  Probst: Back at Fei Long, Leslie got the first clue, and she shared it with Todd. <br/>I can't believe she told me. I'm in shock. I would never tell anybody. <br/>Probst: At Zhan Hu, the problems continued. <br/>It looks like a natural disaster hit our camp. <br/>Probst: Zhan Hu falling behind! Fei Long is through! And they lost yet again. Fei Long wins immunity! So Ashley was sent home. By day nine, Leslie and Todd still hadn't found the idol, and when Zhan Hu  finally won an immunity challenge, Fei Long made their first visit to tribal  council... Third person voted out of Survivor: China... ...and Leslie was  sent home. Todd and James both launch and both connect! At the next immunity challenge, Fei Long regained their dominance. Fei Long wins immunity! And Zhan Hu sent Dave home. On day 13, the game dramatically changed. <br/>Someone's coming in. <br/>Oh, no, you guys. Something's going on. <br/>Probst: The tribes swapped their two best players. <br/>Oh, the humanity. <br/>Probst: James and Aaron went to Zhan Hu. Frosti and Sherea went to Fei Long. Thinking of the future and a possible merge, the Zhan Hu women came up with a  plan to weaken Fei Long. <br/>If we throw these next two, not only have we gotten rid of the two biggest  threats for individual immunity, we will be going into a merge with five  original Zhan Hu. <br/>Probst: Peih-Gee and Jaime threw the immunity challenge... Fei Long wins  immunity! ...and voted off Aaron. They planned to throw the next challenge and vote off James. But Todd came up with a counter[1]plan. <br/>If we win reward today, we are bringing over either Aaron or James, whoever  is left, because they're going to give us a clue as to where that hidden  immunity idol is. <br/>Bring him back, baby. <br/>Come back, James. <br/>Come on, James. Come on home. <br/>Probst: Fei Long kidnapped James, and Todd got his clue to the hidden  immunity idol. <br/>I know what to do, dude. <br/>Probst: Todd found the idol and gave it to James so he could save himself at  the next Zhan Hu tribal council. <br/>James loses immunity. They vote for him, but he uses the idol to get rid of Jaime. <br/>Probst: Having rejoined the Zhan Hu Tribe, James was ready to throw the  food-eating immunity challenge. <br/>Bite it! <br/>Probst: But when he went up against Denise.... <br/>I can't swallow it. <br/>Probst: ...she unexpectedly gave up. Zhan Hu wins immunity. <br/>Perfect plan smashed. <br/>Probst: In only their second trip to tribal council, Fei Long voted out the  former Zhan Hu member Sherea. The tribe has spoken. At Zhan Hu, James found the second hidden immunity idol, making him virtually  invincible. <br/>That's funny. I'm on Survivorwith two idols. <br/>Probst: On day 20... Drop your buffs. You are merged. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: ...with a 6-4 advantage, the former members of Fei Long made a pact  to vote out the former Zhan Hu. <br/>We have every vote from here on out. <br/>I know. <br/>We just have to keep loyal. We can't let Jaime and Peih-Gee and Erik break us up. <br/>I don't want any dissension amongst us until we get to the final six, until  all of them are gone. <br/>Probst: The first target after the merge was Jaime. The tribe has spoken. The former Fei Long seemed intact. Jean-Robert then decided to go against the plan and tried to oust one of his  own, his former ally James. <br/>We could blindside him tonight, because he will not pull out the idol tonight. <br/>I know, I know. <br/>Probst: But instead, Todd convinced the alliance to send Jean-Robert home. <br/>Probst: Jean-Robert, the tribe has spoken. Frosti went next. And with seven remaining, the Fei Long alliance of five seemed impenetrable. Then Amanda tried to take over the game. <br/>If we get rid of James tonight... Let's just get this over with, because I'm  tired of not being in control. I like control. <br/>Probst: And she easily convinced everyone else to get on board. <br/>I will do what everybody feels the most comfortable doing. <br/>Probst: Confident in his alliance... If anyone has a hidden immunity idol,  now would be the time to play it. ...James chose not to play one of his idols. James. And he was voted out by the people he trusted. The tribe has spoken. To Peih-Gee and Erik's surprise, they were still in the game. <br/>If I can get one or maybe even two more people, we could possibly cause a tie  at tribal council. <br/>Probst: The former Zhan Hu tried to make a play to split the alliance of four  by targeting Todd. <br/>You guys don't think I have anything to be worried about, do you? <br/>No. <br/>Probst: But their plan failed. Erik, you need to bring me your torch. And Erik and Peih-Gee found themselves on the jury. Now four are left: Courtney, the waitress...  I went in calling myself the absolute biggest long shot, and I still think  I'm the longest shot to win it, but the fact that I've made it this far is  insane. <br/>Probst: ...Denise, the lunch lady...  I can overcome anything. I can survive anything. And you know, this is a life[1]changing  experience for me. <br/>Probst: ...Amanda, the beauty queen...  Everyone thinks that I've been a quiet player. Well, I've been quiet because it's been part of my strategy. <br/>Probst: ...and Todd, the flight attendant. <br/>I wasn't the strongest, I wasn't the smartest, but I was definitely the most  strategic. <br/>Probst: All four have stayed loyal to each other from the beginning, but who  will be the first to turn on the others? Find out tonight as they compete to stay in the game, and one will outlast  all the rest and will outlast all the rest and become the soul survive. become the soul survive.

How fantastic is that? <br/>Unbelievable. <br/>Unbelievable. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. I'm, like, in shock. I thought I would be out in 16th place. So here I am, guaranteed at least one in four of winning. We are final four on Survivor freaking China. <br/>A pack of four bitches. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I love us. <br/>I've always sort of slipped through the cracks to get to the top, so  hopefully I can continue to slip through. The four of us were, like, you know, the bottom of the totem pole from the  beginning. <br/>Exactly. <br/>The immunity challenge that we have left, we'll have to see what it is. If it's something that I can pull off, then, I mean, that would be a great  way to go to the final three-- with, you the final three-- with, you know,  the immunity necklace. know, the immunity necklace. <br/>I can't believe it's day 37. <br/>Yeah, no kidding. Unbelievable. I just want to be happy for one day while I'm here. <br/>Right. <br/>We're definitely in need of food right now, so any kind of food and fuel at  this point would help us, help me out immensely, and just to get us through  this final couple days. How comfortable can you be on a bamboo bed? Now it's the final four, and someone else is going to go home, and now it's  going to be a tough fight. But, I mean, I've proven myself a lot. I mean, what I've learned about myself, I mean, I can overcome anything, and  you know, this is a life-changing experience for me. <br/>Tree mail! <br/>What does it say? A reward challenge or an immunity? <br/>I don't know. "One last chance to win some fuel, great food and drinks and treats. Put blocks back into out Great Wall for another chance to eat."  I bet it's pizza and beer. <br/>Oh, my God. I'm going to cry. I've kind of been in a funk the past couple days because I've had no food. This reward is going to be probably the most important reward of the game so  far, just because you know you have immunity coming up. You need energy. It has to be done. <br/>This will be good. <br/>This will be good. <br/>Food, man. <br/>Food, man. <br/>Food, man. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Guys ready to get to today's reward challenge? <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: For today's reward challenge, you must tackle our version of the  Great Wall of China. On my go, you'll start at the top of the wall, climb down a ladder, and cross  a bridge. You'll come to another bridge, where you must use planks to finish building  the bridge before you cross it. At the end of the course, you'll find a traditional Chinese yoke and a stack  of puzzle blocks. You'll use the yoke to transport the blocks back to the top of the wall. Once you have all your blocks at the top of the wall, you can start solving  the puzzle by filling in your section of the wall. First person to finish wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: You're playing for comfort and advantage-- comfort in the form of the  kind of food your taste buds have been craving for 37 days. <br/>Oh! <br/>I'm going to cry. Oh! <br/>Probst: Pizza, beer, soft drinks, brownies. <br/>I want the brownie real bad. <br/>Probst: You get the emotional comfort, the kind of food that will make you  feel better. The advantage comes in the calories you will put into your body heading into  the next immunity challenge. This is a serving for one. And I don't have to tell you, food and strength are critical as you get  closer to that million dollars. I know it's worth playing for. We'll get started. We'll get started. Head over to the wall. Head over to the wall. Here we go. For reward, survivors ready? For reward, survivors ready? Go! Go! Todd takes a big jump, not wasting anything time. First stage, you have to finish building the bridge before you can cross it. It only goes together one way. Everybody working quickly. Todd with another piece.

Denise and Courtney quickly falling out of it. Pizza, beer, brownies, soft drinks. Todd heading back with the rest of his puzzle blocks. Courtney has her bridge finished. Denise the only one left working on the bridge. Todd is back. He has all 12 of his blocks. Start working on the puzzle. You are looking for the gray on the top and the sides.

She's now starting to work on She's now starting to work on the puzzle. the puzzle. the puzzle. Todd getting close. Todd getting close. Amanda thinks she may be on to Amanda thinks she may be on to something. something. Amanda wins reward! <br/>Oh, my God! I can't believe I did that. I can't believe I did that. <br/>Good job, Amanda. <br/>Good job, Amanda. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: All right, Amanda, come on over. <br/>Thank you, guys. [ applause] You guys did really good too. <br/>Probst: Nice job. Pizza, beer, soft drinks, brownies. With every reward comes a dilemma. Here's yours. This is a serving for one. You can keep it that way and make sure you're the one that gets all the  emotional comfort and all the calories heading into the next immunity  challenge, or you can invite one or two people to join you. Whatever decision you make will have an impact on somebody. <br/>Oh, God. I hate this. <br/>Probst: What's going through your head? Is there a part of you thinking, "It'd be cleaner to just keep this for  myself"? <br/>Well, I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so I feel like if I eat alone,  then, you know, they're all on even ground, and I'm not, like, choosing one  over another. But then it's hard, because Denise has chose me for a reward before, and you  know, I love Todd and Courtney. So I'm, like, torn, you know. <br/>Probst: Take a minute. <br/>Oh, God! <br/>Probst: Day 37, final four, million-dollar prize at the end. How will this decision factor into the finish? <br/>I'm sorry, you guys. Todd, I'm going to have Todd stay with me. stay with me. <br/>Probst: Todd, come on over. <br/>Probst: Todd, come on over. You're sticking with one person. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Denise, Courtney, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. <br/>Oh, it's a pizza with a butterfly. Oh, my gosh. <br/>Thank you, thank you. Thank you. <br/>Sure. Well, I thought this would give us, like, a good opportunity to talk, since  we haven't...  Since we don't get to talk. <br/>The reward today was pizza, and I could take along one or two people. I definitely wanted to take Todd because I wanted to see where his head was  at, because I don't trust Todd at all. Like, I honestly think if he would have won today, he wouldn't have picked me  to eat. I think he would have picked Courtney or Denise. <br/>Dig in, girl! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>I can't tell you how happy I am that you picked me. Thank you. <br/>That was, like, the hardest decision I've ever had to make. <br/>Amanda, you needed that so bad. <br/>I know. I'm glad we have the chance to talk, though, because I... there are some  things that happened that I don't understand, and it makes me, like...  honestly, I don't trust you that much, like, from what I've heard. <br/>What? <br/>Yeah. And I don't know, like, it just makes you wonder, because you hear all this  stuff, and them I'm like... I just have the feeling that if anyone was to  backstab me right now, you would. <br/>That makes me feel kind of sad. You know, it hurts me. But I can tell by the way you've been looking at me that you've been, like,  antsy about me. But there's one girl in this game that I've been honest to literally since  day one. That's been you. <br/>And I've been honest to you too. I'm just glad we get to clear the air now. <br/>Right. <br/>Because you get voted out, and you're like, "Oh, my God," like, you  know what I mean? <br/>Amanda flat out let me know that the past couple of days she hasn't been  trusting me, which hurt my feelings, because I really have been in my head  knowing that I'm going to stay true to Amanda. Honestly, swear on my mama's life, if it was the final two, it's me and you,  because that's my deal. I'm not very cool with losing to Denise, and I'm not very cool with losing to  Courtney. You don't have to trust me, but, like, that's the honest, 100% truth from  Todd. I swear on my life. I'm in this to the end with you. I hope that she can trust me. I really, really hope so, I really, really hope so, because I need her right  now. because I need her right now. <br/>Jump in? <br/>I'm going to lay here and be stinky for a little while, and then I might jump  in. <br/>I'm going to jump in. Then I'm going to come back and lay here and be stinky. <br/>It hurt my feelings a little that Amanda didn't take me. Pizza and beer would have been great today. I would have enjoyed it. We haven't been eating too much around here. So any time that you get to eat something and get stronger for the next  challenges is very the next challenges is very important. important. When I was a kid, I wasn't the popular kid. I was always on the outside. And a lot of times during this game, I wasn't picked. I was picked last or I was picked second to last or I wasn't picked at all. But having an alliance, being in a group of, you know, four people, I've been  safe. But now it's four people. One's going home. It's... you know, there is going to be somebody left out. It is so humid and hot out here. <br/>Yeah. I've sort of embraced it. I'm just going to be in a sweat bath for the rest of the day. <br/>I thought Todd and you were pretty tight. It looks like Todd and Amanda are pretty tight. <br/>We'll just have to see what  We'll just have to see what happens. happens. happens. <br/>Todd. <br/>Todd. <br/>Todd. <br/>Isn't he, though? <br/>Isn't he, though? <br/>You know, a lot's going through my head right now. It's kind of a mix of, well, can I trust my girls that I've been trusting for  so long, or are they going to turn on me? But I have no choice but to just hope, you know? I can talk all I want, but other than that, I have to just hope. <br/>Hi, guys. <br/>Hi, guys. <br/>What's up? <br/>What's up? <br/>It was good. It's like 900,000 degrees too. It's like 900,000 degrees too. <br/>Exactly. <br/>Exactly. <br/>I love all three of you girls so much, so no matter whose name I have to  write down tomorrow, I have to write down one of the three of your names, and  bottom line, it hurts. <br/>You know, I just don't want to go home yet. <br/>I hear you. I don't know. I really am afraid that it's going to go all girl power on me tomorrow and  I'll probably be the one that's gone. But, I mean, I'm in the fight to win, just like everybody else is going to  fight to win. <br/>Who do you think has the best chance right now of winning? <br/>Amanda or Courtney. <br/>So, I mean, then... I mean, there you go. I mean, there's two people to get rid of that at least have a chance of  getting more votes than either one of us. <br/>Uh-huh. Believe me. I've thought about it. <br/>Todd and Denise were laying in the shelter, and I heard them talking, and I  heard my name. So I just kind of sat there and listened to them talk. <br/>I'm bugged by the fact that I've built relationships with all of you guys,  and I hope it doesn't ruin whoever's name I have to write down. <br/>Right. <br/>Todd, I think, is a slippery little sucker and always has been. He does hold a lot of the cards, and he always manages to weasel his way into  something. So whether it's half of a pizza or a seat in the top three, like, you can  count on Todd. He will not look out for you. He does not care. He does not care. He is looking out for himself. He is looking out for himself. <br/>Todd and Denise were, like, talking in the shelter. They were, like, talking about the final four or whatever. So I don't know if Todd is, like, just paranoid at this point, but he's,  like, just talking different stories to each one of us. <br/>That's why I had Todd go, just because, like, I wanted him to still feel like  he could trust me, you know? Well, Todd was, like, telling me, "No, I want you, me, and Courtney. Like, you can trust me. I'm in this." And I told him point blank, "Todd, I don't trust you. Give me some reason why me and Courtney should trust you right now, because  honestly, I don't." And I told him point blank I didn't. Then he's like, "Amanda, it's the final two, and let's get rid of  Courtney." And I'm like, "You're telling And I'm like, "You're  telling everyone a different story." everyone a different story."  Hey. <br/>Hey, guys. What's up? <br/>Nada. Nada-banada. <br/>I know I'm feeling paranoia to be left alone. I see people gather off on their own, and that bugs me. <br/>I just want to, like... I don't know, like, are we cool? If one of the three of us wins, she's going? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm hoping that Courtney and Amanda are still on the same wavelengths as me  so that Denise can be the next on the chopping block instead of them going  all girl power on me and voting me out. So paranoia on my side is quite high, and I hate being paranoid. I hate it. I don't know. I think we'd be probably the most fantastic final three in most fantastic  final three in the entire world. the entire world. <br/>Hey, girlies, tree mail. It's sealed. Okay, you guys ready? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Okay. "Congratulations, final four. You have done what 12 of your fellow tribesmen and women could not. Today you will honor their memories before proceeding to your final immunity  challenge. Get into your boat and paddle across the lake to the giant statue of Guanyin,  the Chinese goddess of compassion and mercy. There you will find the torches of your fallen comrades. As you pass them, light the firecrackers in celebration of their time here in  China, remembering them as each had a part in getting you this far. You will then proceed to your You will then proceed to your final immunity  challenge." final immunity challenge." Every single person that's  been voted off has helped me to get here. I am grateful for them. I absolutely think that they've all done a huge part in me getting to the end. It's so bittersweet. Like, you're so sad to be leaving people that you really like, but there were  16 of us, and one of us is going to be the winner. <br/>You guys ready? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Let's do this. <br/>Let's do this. <br/>All right, here we go. <br/>All right, here we go. <br/>All right, here we go. <br/>Chicken. <br/>Chicken. <br/>With a name like Chicken, how can you not be cool? can you not be cool? [ firecrackers popping] [ firecrackers popping]  Going into the game, I was going to be myself. I never thought about being the person voted off, so it was tough. I couldn't relate to the people. You know, I tried. It was just I'm out of their It was just I'm out of their generation big time. generation big time. <br/>Ashley, I really, really wish that we had more of a chance to get to know  each other, because I bet we would have been good I bet we would have been  good friends. friends. [ firecrackers popping]  I'm a professional wrestler. I've done all kinds of stuff where I had to stick it out. But I wasn't expecting this, to tell you the truth. Having had this experience, I got to do some stuff that I've never imagined I  would be doing, just, like, being huddled up underneath our little walkway  in, like, a monsoon thunderstorm. Things like that, like, that are just crazy stories that I'll probably tell  my grandchildren, that's some stuff I'll take home that's some stuff I'll  take home from being here. from being here. <br/>So, Leslie, we were probably the most unlikely friends, but I the most  unlikely friends, but I hope I made you proud. hope I made you proud. [ firecrackers popping]  Survivoris a hard game. It's a game that changes you, spiritually, emotionally, mentally, definitely  physically. I mean, it changes every aspect of you-- and definitely for the better. And I can tell you, as miserable as I was for nine days, I would as I was for  nine days, I would do it again in a heartbeat. do it again in a heartbeat. <br/>Crazy Dave. I mean, what can you say? The guy's fun. [ firecrackers popping]  My strategy going into the game was to be indispensable around camp and to be  highly likable. I was really passionate about helping people, and it was helping people, and  it was potentially my downfall. potentially my downfall. <br/>Aaron. I miss Aaron. I miss Aaron. I love Aaron-- so fun. I love Aaron-- so fun. [ firecrackers popping]  The hardest part of the game for me was trying to wear too many hats, trying  to please too many people. But playing the game of Survivor is a lot like surfing in that, you know, put  yourself in an element that you're not really used to. I've gone over plenty of the falls, and I take my share of wipeouts, but you  always keep going back for more, and then the next day, the challenge comes,  and you're the one who wins it for your tribe, and you're on that high, and  you're like, "This is the reason I like, "This is the reason I  signed up for it." signed up for it."  Sherea. I miss you a lot, and you were I miss you a lot, and you were one of my good  friends. one of my good friends. [ firecrackers popping]  Survivorgave me a great sense of adventure in myself. I was totally out of my element and didn't think I really could do it, and I  did. Now I know that I'm way stronger Now I know that I'm way stronger than I even  thought I was. than I even thought I was. <br/>Oh, Jaime, love, having you around camp was like always having your favorite  piece of bubble gum in your mouth-- bubble gum in your mouth-- funtastic. funtastic. <br/>I had a good time out there, believe it or not. I would do it again in a heartbeat. I'm pretty loud, I'm pretty boisterous, and I pretty much let people know  what's going on in my head. I think I was blessed that I had Erik as a friend out there, which you don't  usually feel on Survivor. A lot of people didn't understand where I was coming from, but Erik  understood everything. I definitely see him as a friend I definitely see him as a friend even after  the game. even after the game. <br/>Ooh, Jean-Robert. I think he's going to be the player most changed after this. <br/>Let us all hope that he's the  Let us all hope that he's the most changed after this. most changed after this. [ firecrackers popping]  I started out kind of rubbing people the wrong way and annoying them, but that's  part of who I am. It's not all of who I am. I'm very well aware of feelings that are going on around me. Did I come out a better person, a stronger person? I'd like to think so. Perhaps I will be a better poker player in the long run because player in the  long run because of this. of this. <br/>Frosti. You're my Munchkin, and I absolutely adore you, and I hope that you'll  forgive me and we that you'll forgive me and we can still be friends. can still be friends. <br/>My Survivorexperience was unforgettable. I know that I'm changed because of it. I think for somebody as young as myself, this is a really big step for me,  and it's really helped me on my own path in helped me on my own path in life. life. <br/>James, a terrific athlete, he's a great guy. Under that big, rough exterior was a great, big, giant teddy was a great,  big, giant teddy bear. bear. [ firecrackers popping]  The hardest part for me was dealing with all the personalities. I'm kind of not the most talkative guy of the group. So, I mean, just dealing with all of those different personalities, it was  odd for me. But... so I know now that I can But... so I know now that I can handle other  people. handle other people. <br/>Oh, Erik, he's such a nice person. Like, he was like a genuinely, like, kind individual. [ firecrackers popping]  The game of Survivorhas definitely been one of the hardest things I've ever  done. But it was so much fun. I wouldn't trade any of it. I'm not a risk taker in life. I'm cautious, like, in relationships. So I like to think that I'm changed.

Today's challenge will test your ability to eliminate all distractions and  focus solely on the task at hand. For today's challenge, you must balance porcelain dishes on the end of a  long, wobbly balancing arm.

Either Amanda or Denise is going to win this challenge and be guaranteed a  spot at the final tribal council, guaranteed a chance to plead your case to  the jury. <br/>All right, Amanda, what do you think? <br/>What do you mean? <br/>What do you mean? <br/>Make a deal? <br/>Make a deal? <br/>You don't want to give up easily, do you? Come on. <br/>Come on. I won't write your name down; you don't write my name down. <br/>I'm not giving up, Denise. <br/>Probst: Be careful of losing your concentration. It does not take much for those dishes to fall. <br/>I'll tell you, I'm going to puke, though. <br/>Probst: Time to place another item. <br/>Oh, crap. <br/>Probst: You're going to place another rice bowl. <br/>Are you sure, Amanda? <br/>Yup.

Amanda not interested in a deal. Amanda not interested in a deal. Denise loses concentration. Amanda wins the final immunity challenge. <br/>Think I was going to let you quit on me? Come on! <br/>Probst: Amanda is going to the final tribal council. <br/>Good job. <br/>Good job, girls. Congratulations, Amanda. <br/>Good job. <br/>Probst: Amanda, come on over. <br/>Congratulations, Amanda. [ applause]  Thank you. <br/>Good job, kid. <br/>Thanks, guys. <br/>Probst: If there was ever a time to have this, now is the time. With this around your neck, you are guaranteed a spot at the final tribal  council and a chance to plead your case for a million bucks. Denise, Todd, Courtney, tribal council tonight, one of you will be voted out  and will become the final member of our jury. If there was ever a time to pull out all the stops, to try to make a deal, to  make something happen, this is it. Head on back to camp. See you at tribal. See you at tribal. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>I'm so excited that I'm for sure in the final three. I have nothing to worry about tonight, but I'm afraid whoever gets voted out  tonight is going to think that it was because of me, because I'm the free  vote tonight. So it's such a good thing, and So it's such a good thing, and then it can be  such a bad thing. then it can be such a bad thing. <br/>I feel really, really nervous right now. You know, a lot of these kids are so much younger than I am. I'm kind of the old lady around here. So, I mean, I do feel a little on the outsides, but I might be on the  outsides, but I might be able to sway Amanda. able to sway Amanda. able to sway Amanda. <br/>You know, I mean...  You know, I mean...  You know, I mean...  You know? <br/>You know? <br/>You know? <br/>You know? <br/>You know? <br/>I think Denise has played a great game, and I think she's been one of the  most honest players here. So it's hard, because I want to keep her around, but I don't, because it's  more competition to me in the end. me in the end. I just... I just... This could be, like, my million[1]dollar  decision tonight. Someone's going to get a million dollars. Two people aren't. So do you give them that chance because they deserve it, or do you pick  someone that you feel you have a better chance you have a better chance  against? against? <br/>Amanda holds all the cards right now. She can vote with Denise right now and make it a tie, so right now my one  goal is to get rid of Denise. And I'm hoping that Courtney and Amanda are still on the same wavelengths as  me, and I hope wavelengths as me, and I hope I'm here on day 39 still. I'm here on day 39 still. <br/>Who are you voting for? <br/>Well, it all depends on what's going on. I mean, I would vote for Todd if I could. <br/>I'll just tell you the position I'm in right now, just so you're fully aware. Me and Todd had an alliance on day one. <br/>Yeah, I understand that. <br/>You know what I'm saying? So I'm really at a crossroads, Denise, because it's like do I backstab  somebody that I've had an alliance with since the beginning? You know what I'm saying? But this kills me, because I would rather have you sitting next to me in  final three than Todd. I haven't even trusted him this whole time. <br/>No, I don't trust him. Would you consider both of us voting for Todd and having it be a tie? <br/>I have to think about it more, but I will guarantee you I will not vote for  you tonight. <br/>Okay. <br/>But I cannot guarantee what they will vote. <br/>At this point in time, anything's possible. Anybody could be lying. I mean, it's hard for me to tell who lies, who doesn't. Amanda said she had my back, so I kind of believe her that she said she  wouldn't write my name down. But on the other hand, you never can tell. Anything is possible, anything can happen, and she might. You know, I really like you, Amanda. I really think you're going to do the right thing. Well, I mean, when you told me that you had my back, I really thought you  meant it too, so...  I did. <br/>Well, now is when I need you  Well, now is when I need you to prove it. to prove it. <br/>Right now in the game my biggest threat is probably Todd. Todd has made a lot of personal connections with a lot of people on the jury. The jury is a younger jury, so I think he's my biggest threat right now. I'm at an awful crossroads. I've been going back and forth in my head: Denise, Todd, Denise, Todd. And they both have their cons. They both have their pros. But still I'm still undecided. I don't know what I'm going to I don't know what I'm going to choose. choose. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury: Jaime, Jean-Robert,  Frosti, James, Erik, and Peih-Gee, voted out at Erik, and Peih-Gee, voted out  at the last tribal council. the last tribal council. So let's establish something right off the bat. Amanda, is there any chance you're going to give up individual immunity  tonight? <br/>No way. <br/>Probst: Okay, so we know Amanda is not going to be voted out. It's going to be Denise, Todd, or Courtney. Todd, the four of you have been together from the beginning. So what are you going to base your vote on tonight? <br/>You know, tonight's vote is probably the hardest vote, because, like, we have  been together since day one. And it is coming down to who you want to pit yourself up against in the end. <br/>Probst: Denise, is it fair to say, "I want to get rid of the biggest  threat in this game"? Or does the biggest threat deserve a shot? <br/>Well, Jeff, I'm going to base my vote on how I feel right now. Because like I said, I'm always on the bottom of the totem pole. There are still people that are in alliances, and it's still hard to break in  even though are you in. So, I mean, I have to do what I got to do tonight because I'm on the outside. <br/>Probst: Courtney, do you feel that Denise is on the outside? Is that a known fact? <br/>Um, I think that everyone's on the outside of some group. I mean, I spent the first half of this game feeling that I was completely on  the outside of everyone, and a lot of times that's an insecurity problem more  than a reality. I mean, it's not necessarily true or false. It's, you know, all perception. <br/>Probst: Todd, how important at this point is perception? You could feel you're on the outside. You could feel you're on the inside. You really don't know until the votes are cast. <br/>Absolutely. I mean, the only one here tonight that should feel fine is Amanda, because  she has that necklace on. And like you said, until those votes are read, I'm going to be sitting here  playing with my fingers, shaking my foot. <br/>Probst: So, Todd, as we sit here right now, you're still not sure if you're  safe or not. <br/>No, I really am not sure. I want to think I am and hope I am, but I've seen a lot happen on this side  of the game. People thought they were sure, and they're not. <br/>Probst: Courtney, how certain are you that you'll be okay, you're going to be  in the final? <br/>I don't think any one of the three of us is sure about it. I mean, you got to be pretty stupid to think you're safe at this point. <br/>Probst: Denise, why does it make sense to keep you tonight? <br/>Well, I don't know why they... they shouldn't vote me out. They think because I have kids I'll have a better influence on the jury and  I'd be sympathetic to the jury. So they don't want to keep me here because they think that that might weigh  on the jury's minds. <br/>Probst: Courtney, why, from a strategy point of view, would it make sense to  actually keep you tonight? <br/>You know, everyone is not going to be excited for me that I somehow managed  to pull through. Like, you know, people are going to be voting on if you're strategic from the  beginning, if you're a fan of the game, if you worked hard on all of the  challenges. You know, there's definitely areas where I'm going to come up a lot shorter  than the other people here. Oh, and then there's my winning personality. I'm sure I've ruffled a few feathers along the way. <br/>Probst: Amanda, was is a busy afternoon for you? Were you very popular? <br/>When you're wearing this, it's funny how people change as they... when they  act towards you. Like, people's attitudes change when they know that you're not going home and  you have a free vote that someone here may need. <br/>Probst: Denise, is Amanda's vote more powerful tonight, or is it just another  vote? <br/>Well, I mean, whoever she votes for, that could be the power switch. I mean, it all depends on which way she goes. I mean, I was talking to her earlier, and at one point, she's like, "I  got your back." You know, I said, "I got your back." And you  know, I hope she votes with me, and I hope she doesn't vote against me. <br/>I said I had your back a while ago. I didn't say that today. I said... you know what I said. <br/>I know, I know, I understand. <br/>Okay. <br/>Probst: Todd, you have the best grin on your face. <br/>You know, it was kind of sly that she said you had your back, and Amanda's  face kind of dropped like, "I never said I had your back." And I  was like, "Oh, that's sharp." I mean, if it was said to me, I'd be  like, "Mm." So that's... I was kind of reacting for Denise, I  guess, in a way. <br/>Probst: Amanda, has the final tribal council already started? Because Todd just took an opportunity to make an editorial comment. <br/>I know. It has already begun. And you just have to put yourself in what you think is the best position and  do your best, and that's all you can do. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to vote. Cannot vote for Amanda. Denise, Todd, Courtney, all three of you are fair game. It is time to vote. It is time to vote. Denise, you're up. Denise, you're up. <br/>Todd, I'm going to have to vote for you because I know you're going to vote  for me tonight. tonight. Good luck. Good luck. <br/>One of the greatest competitors in this game so far. You've been awesome to me. You've been awesome to me. Thank you. Thank you. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Denise. Todd. One vote Todd. Denise. Two votes Denise. One vote Todd. One vote Todd. One vote left. One vote left. 13th person voted out and the seventh member of our jury, Denise. Denise. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Denise, the tribe has spoken. Denise, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. Amanda, Todd, Courtney, you've gone as far as you can go in this game. The power now shifts to the jury. Seven people that you had a hand in voting out now hold your fate in their  hands. The only power you have left is the opportunity to persuade them it should be  you. You have one night left in China. Enjoy it. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>I definitely believe I would have won this entire thing if I had stayed in  the game. I'm just proud of what I've accomplished. I think I did a great job. I never gave up. And to make it 38 days out here is a spectacular thing for a 40- is a  spectacular thing for a 40- year-old woman. year-old woman. <br/>Congratulations, girlies. <br/>Congratulations, girlies. We did it. We did it. <br/>Amanda. <br/>What? <br/>Wait, wait, wait, wait. Please stop. Come here. <br/>What do you have to say to me, Todd? Do you want to call me out in tribal again? <br/>What do you mean call you out? <br/>I'm so over this. Like, I could not be more over this. We just got back from tribal council, and I feel horrible. In essence, Todd made me look bad in front of the jury. <br/>This is the face that I made. I went, "Ah," like ouch, burn, that hurts, but it's true. <br/>Yeah, exactly. That's why I'm mad. Because I was like, "Denise, I did not say I had your back today."  And I know how that sounded, but then you put in that comment. <br/>You're right. <br/>Cut me off at the knees. <br/>I didn't mean it that way. <br/>Well, that's how it came out. <br/>I'm sorry. <br/>Like, I'm not retarded. I know what happened. What happened was Denise was trying to say that I told her before tribal  council that I had her back, but I definitely don't think I did it. I think... I had told her before that I had her back, but not today. And it sounded bad because it sounded like, "No, I'm in the not going to  have your back today." And then Todd made a face like, "Oh, my God,  Amanda."  I wasn't doing it to backstab you. <br/>No, listen to me. You can totally go in tomorrow and trash me as much as you want. <br/>I'm not going to! <br/>But I'm saying that's fine, because I know it's your game. But don't expect everything to be, like, okay if you do stuff like that to  me, because I don't like people like that. <br/>I didn't...  I am honestly disappointed with myself, because I'm in the final three with a  guy who would stab me in the back in a second and who has pretty much lied,  cheated his way into the finals with my help. So I feel like crap. <br/>And I honestly mean that. I did not mean to turn it on you. <br/>Yeah, you did. <br/>No, I didn't! <br/>That's fine, whatever. <br/>That's fine, whatever. <br/>You don't believe me. <br/>You don't believe me. <br/>It really was an accident. My last intention was to turn it on to Amanda and make her look like a bad guy. So it was a complete slip-up. And you know, she, I don't think, believes me that it was an accident, but it  was. I wish that you wanted to celebrate, because we're in the final three  together like we planned. <br/>I have nothing to celebrate. I don't feel like I... I don't know. You guys can celebrate. You guys can celebrate. I'm going to bed. I'm going to bed. <br/>Day 39. <br/>Day 39. We made it. We made it. <br/>...I get to use a Q-Tip. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Peanut butter, like this. <br/>Peanut butter, like this. <br/>Guys, I see something-- a lot of something, you guys! <br/>It's like Christmas! <br/>Ah! <br/>Yay! <br/>Ah! <br/>Looks like we'll be starting a fire! We'll be starting a fire! <br/>Oh, my God! Oh, my God, what's that? <br/>There's chicken and eggs and...  It's pancake batter. <br/>All right, this is what we're going to do. Carry it back. We'll eat the pastries and some of the fruit, and then we'll get into the  hard stuff. <br/>And then we'll make fire? <br/>We're cooking, Todd. Perfect. We're cooking in a jungle! <br/>China's been a crazy experience for me. I'm glad that, you know, China was as hard as it was. Like, it rained. It was so hot. You know, it is like a building experience. <br/>Cheers to the final three, girls! <br/>Who ever would have thought? <br/>No one. <br/>Not me. I'm proud of myself, and I can't believe it. Like, my final goal was to make the final three, and I did. <br/>Can you guys believe that we made it this far? <br/>No. <br/>The three of us, really. <br/>I am so happy it's you guys too. <br/>Me too. <br/>Now I'm getting sappy too. I think I do have really good personal relationships on the jury. I have never been anything but my own winsome personality that has been  called every name in the book since day one. So hopefully... I mean, hopefully that'll have some credit. I made it this far, and that should get some respect from some people. I'm getting full. <br/>I know. <br/>It's the most amazing  It's the most amazing feeling. feeling. <br/>Let's burn Jean-Robert's $500 Louis Vuittons. <br/>Louis Vuitton. Let's do this. <br/>All right, ready, guys? <br/>Yeah. I think the biggest part of being out here in China is out here, I have felt  more emotions and thought more about my life in general than I ever, ever  have. So I think China has almost helped me to grow up. This is for 38 days of suffering in the jungles of China and to day 39 where  we're the final day 39 where we're the final three! three! Burn! I feel like, looking at the jury, I stand an okay shot. I backstabbed and lied to a lot of them, but I was playing a game. And whether I win a million dollars tonight or not, I feel like I've  accomplished a lot, like I've accomplished a lot, and I'm so proud. and I'm so proud. <br/>Honestly, I think it's anyone's game at this point. I think I have a 33% chance of winning, of winning the money. And I'm just going to go in tonight, tell them the honest truth about my game  and how I've truth about my game and how I've played. played. I think a lot of my fear of failure and things like that have been minimized  because of this experience, and I'm ready to do it now. to do it now. I'm not afraid of it. I'm not afraid of it. I'm nervous for tonight, because all of this is coming to an end. I know I'm going to be emotional. And... it'll be good. And... it'll be good. I'm excited. I'm excited. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in  Probst: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. the members of our jury. Jaime, Jean-Robert, Frosti, James, Erik, Peih-Gee, and Denise, voted out at  the last Denise, voted out at the last tribal council. tribal council. Amanda, Todd, Courtney, welcome to your final tribal council. After 39 days, the power now shifts from the three of you to the jury. Tonight they will decide who is most deserving of the title of sole survivor  and the million[1]dollar  check that goes with it. This is your last chance to convince them you are the one who is most  deserving. Here's how it's going to work. You will each get a chance to make an opening statement. The jury will then get a chance to address you. to address you. And then we will vote. And then we will vote. You guys ready to get started? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Opening statements. Amanda, you're up. <br/>Okay. Um, you know, I had a lot of time to reflect on the experience, the whole  experience today, and I feel very blessed to be sitting here. This was a hard 39 days. And it's finally come to an end. And I came into this game knowing a specific strategy that I was going to  follow and that I had to align myself with someone right away. So I aligned with Todd. My strategy then changed, like, towards the end game, so I was with people  that I had a chance to physically compete against. And I did. I won the last two immunity challenges. But there are some things I'm not proud of that I've done. You know, I voted for some people that didn't think that I was going to vote  for them-- you know, specifically James, Jean[1]Robert,  and Frosti. I am sorry if I hurt your feelings, and I really respect playing with all of  you. So... that's all I have to say. <br/>Probst: Todd. <br/>All right, guys. I'm stoked to be here tonight, and you know, the first thing I want to say  really is thank you for being where you are and helping me to get in this  spot in the game. I know that I played a game where I had to lie and I had to backstab and I  had to hurt people that I cared about. And the main thing I can ask tonight is that you are able to see the  difference between my strategic game and the relations that I actually built  with you, because the relations on a personal level-- honest, real. The game level, the strategic level is what I came here to do. I knew coming in the game I was not the most physical, but I knew that I  could be the most strategic, and if I did that, I could get here. This is my dream come true. I've lived my dream, and you know, you guys have all been a part of it. And I'm happy to answer whatever questions, hear whatever you have to say  about me. I'm ready for it. But I really do want to say thank you for helping me in the game. It means the world to me. So thanks. <br/>Probst: Courtney. <br/>Okay. Hello, everyone. Unlike the other two people sitting here, I was not a lifelong Survivorfan. No strategy. No idea what I was doing. And every single time that I didn't get voted out, I was actually surprised. So that's what sets me apart from these two guys. I figured out how to survive in a game that was completely physical in the  beginning. I started the game weighing 95 pounds, and I was physically scared to be in  this game in the beginning. I had to figure out a way to just somehow manage to make it work for me, and  I did that. Around the time of the merge, things changed, and I sort of got my footing a  little bit better. I did win a personal immunity. So whoever saw that coming? Not me. I was surprised. I made good alliances that worked for me. I was always pretty up front, as much as you can be in this scenario. And I'm really proud of myself. And it think that, you know, whether or not you not you like me personally,  you have to give a little bit of credit to the little girl who everyone  thought would be gone in the first six days and is still sitting here days  and is still sitting here on day 39. on day 39. <br/>Probst: All right, jury, in a minute, you're going to get your first chance  to address Amanda, Todd, and Courtney. I'll give you a minute to think I'll give you a minute to think about what  you want to say. about what you want to say. <br/>Probst: All right, jury, it is now your opportunity to address Amanda, Todd,  and Courtney. This is your chance to gain the information you need to make a million-dollar  decision. You can address one, two, or all three of them. three of them. James, you're up first. James, you're up first. <br/>All right, I just want to congratulate you all. You did what you all were supposed to do. You made it to the final three. I'm not even going to be a bitter betty. Courtney, I just want to know something good, so just a good time that y'all  had in the game of Survivor? <br/>I think one of the best times I had was actually the very first challenge  that our team did together, because when I picked up the pole the first time,  I was like, "Sweet mother of God, this thing weighs 50 pounds; I'm going  to die." And then when we actually won it in the end and I stuck the  thing in, I was like, "I'm not going to be the first person voted out of  Survivor! Oh, my God! This is crazy!"  Congratulations. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: James, I have a question for you. Why that question? <br/>Well, I mean, I just wanted to make it easier, because it might be kind of  rough in a little while. I'm not bitter betty. <br/>Probst: Thanks, James. <br/>Probst: Thanks, James. J.R., Jean-Robert, you're up. J.R., Jean-Robert, you're up. <br/>Congratulations, guys. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>But I got a dilemma. I have a real problem here. From day one, it hasn't been a secret that I haven't really felt like  Courtney is necessarily deserving of getting to the end, but I also promised  Todd and I promised Amanda that if you guys backstab me, you would not be  winning a million dollars. So here I am. [ laughter] Okay, can it be anyone besides you three? But it's the three of you. Okay, now I have to make a decision. So I got to tell you, tonight, my vote is live for any of you. I'm asking you, Courtney, how can I, in good conscience, give you my vote  tonight? <br/>The game is outwit, outlast, outplay, and I have done all three of those  things. And you know, I won an immunity. Like, that... did you win an immunity? I came from the worst odds. I was never the favorite in this game. <br/>I agree with that. <br/>There you go. <br/>Thanks, that's a good answer. By the way, I started out this game with the strategy of being a brutal jerk  and was going to try and come around. The second half of my game never got into play because I was blindsided,  which brings me to Amanda. Day 23. I went to you, and I said, "Amanda, I will not backstab you." At  that point, you said to me, "I will not be putting your name down on a  ballet." That's what you said to me on day 23. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Day 24 comes around, my name's on a ballot. I'm asking you, when you said that to me, were you outright lying to me, or  did you make a commitment to me and just go back on your word? <br/>I was not lying to you. And honestly, I did not want to vote for you. But too many other people did. So honestly, it was a very, very hard decision for me. It's not one I'm proud of. And I am sorry for lying to you. <br/>So you lied to me. First you're saying you broke your word to me. Now you're saying I lied to you. What happened there? <br/>No, I broke the word to you. I didn't lie to you. I did not want to put your name down. <br/>Okay. <br/>But I am telling you I was between a rock and a hard place. I had no choice. <br/>Todd, day one, I went to you and said, "Todd, you know what? You're the schemer here. I know it. I'm on to you. You have the knowledge, and you have the smarts." We had a plan to send  James home. The best move for all of us at that time was to get rid of James, okay? In my opinion, you organizing to blindside me-- yeah, you blindsided me. Okay, I'm out of the game. But I wasn't the biggest threat. <br/>You started to strategically place ideas in people's heads, which is what I  wanted my job to be. And when you had approached me about blindsiding James, I was like, "Oh,  no, he is catching up." So who then becomes the biggest threat to me? You. What do I have to do? Turn it around on you, who is an extremely great, strategic player in your  daily life. I had to get rid of my biggest I had to get rid of my biggest strategic  threat, who was you. strategic threat, who was you. <br/>Guys, congratulations. Well done. [ laughter] That was a good answer. That was a good answer. [ laughter] [ laughter]  Probst: James, I'm confused. <br/>Probst: James, I'm confused. What are you laughing at? What are you laughing at? <br/>I mean, he shut his mouth. <br/>I mean, he shut his mouth. [ laughter] [ laughter] [ laughter]  Probst: Peih-Gee, you're up. <br/>Probst: Peih-Gee, you're up. <br/>All right, I want to vote for the person that I think deserves it the most. Todd, you talked about having played a really strategic game. You say that you played it hard. You know, I want to know that you didn't just slide in here because somebody  decided you were going to be easy to beat. <br/>First, I didn't slide anywhere. I started working day one. Jean-Robert called me out and said I'm a sneaky, sly little bastard that was  going to get through this game and he had to watch out for. He was right. Second, I gathered my numbers. I got myself Amanda. I got myself Courtney, right? I was like, "Good, I've got some numbers." Pulled in Denise. We get to the merge, we pick you guys off, then it's a head-to battle, but I  still got my numbers. I fought. It's a glorious battle, art of war, yin and yang. I came out as a fighter. That's just bottom line. <br/>Amanda, I'm sick of you looking at me with doe eyes, and every time you've  opened your mouth to any one of these people, you sound apologetic. <br/>Okay. <br/>Because you wanted Todd to take the fall as the bad guy, you know? I want to hear what you think you did that was better than what Todd did. <br/>Part of my strategy in this game was making sure that I was with people in  the end that I could physically compete against. James is a physical competitor. He had two immunity idols. That is a guaranteed spot in the top five. So I said let's... you know, "What about if we just... you know, we have  to get rid of James. It's either now or never, because he could pull out six, and he could pull  out five, and then he's in the top four, and then he's in the top three spot,  and then there's only places for two of us."  Uh-huh. <br/>So that is the most strategic move that I made in this game. <br/>So the decision to get rid of James was your idea. <br/>It was my idea. <br/>All right, cool. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Peih-Gee. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Peih-Gee. Erik. Erik. <br/>I want to know what was the riskiest move you made in the game where you knew  that it was your ass if you didn't. Amanda, let's hear from you. <br/>Definitely I think my riskiest move in this game was the decision to get rid  of James, and I really believed that Todd and James had something going on. And you know, if James got in there, he was going to not only take a third  spot, but wreck my alliance that I already had. So that was definitely the riskiest move from my strategic play in this game. <br/>I'm just trying to understand. <br/>Okay. <br/>Like, voting out a guy with two immunity idols does not sound very risky to  me. It sounds like a no-brainer. <br/>If he would have played an idol, I would have lost my alliance partner, and  then I would have had to start all over again. So it was a very risky move. We were all nervous at that tribal council. It would have changed the whole game if something else would have happened. <br/>All right. Well, I think I've got what I need to know. Thank you, guys. Thank you, guys. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Erik. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Erik. Frosti, you're up. <br/>Todd, you know, I love you, but I don't even know if I know you. You lied up, down, left, and right and all the way back around in circles. Why do you think that your game play deserves a vote from Frosti? <br/>I think you're a great kid. My personal relations were different than my game relations. And yes, I did know that I wanted to take you in, be close with you, make  myself a buddy, and put you on a jury. And what I built with you as a friend was real. But yeah, I did do a big, huge lie to my buddy Frosti. I'm sorry. <br/>All right. Hey. Courtney, what's up? How you doing? You look great. <br/>Thanks. I dressed up for you. <br/>Now, I am really interested to hear what you have to say, because I think of  all the three people, your game play interested me the most. Amanda, I assumed, was going to lie and backstab me eventually. Todd, I knew, was going to lie and backstab me eventually. But you, actually, interestingly enough, surprised me when you lied,  backstabbed me just a little bit. You also flat out said to me, unprovoked, that if my name came up with other  people, you would tell me. <br/>Um, no, everyone was in a blind, panicked frenzy that I wouldn't vote for you. So all eyes were sort of on me, and, I mean, if I pulled you aside, you know,  it might have made you feel a little bit better or a little bit worse, but I  don't... I mean, I don't know that it would have changed any outcome. But it wasn't like I went out and aggressively befriended you just to take  you out of the game and then like, "Oh, good, pocket juror." That's  just... that's not what happened. <br/>Thanks, guys. <br/>Thanks, guys. <br/>Probst: Jaime, you're up. <br/>Probst: Jaime, you're up. <br/>Hi, guys. <br/>Hi! <br/>I have a kind of fun question where you guys get to pull each other's dirty  laundry out for the other people. I don't want it sugarcoated. So, Courtney, I'm going to start with you. If you could start off by telling me everything that we would be disappointed  in Todd about knowing and what he's done, what lies he's told, why we  shouldn't vote for him but we should vote for you. <br/>I think airing Todd's dirty laundry is pretty redundant. I think he wears it on his sleeve. I think every single person here knows exactly every bad thing that Todd's  done, and that's why you're sitting over there. <br/>But what has he done? <br/>Um, well, he organized voting out Jean-Robert, and then he organized voting  out Frosti, and then he helped Amanda with voting out James. I mean, there's not really specifics. <br/>So he deserves the million dollars more than you do? Is that what you're saying? <br/>I think that each one of us has a different reason that we are deserving, and  that's...  Exactly, but why is he not deserving? <br/>I think he might be deserving. I think it's an equal opportunity. <br/>So Todd should get my million-dollar vote? <br/>If that's the way you...  Okay, Todd, we're going to skip that question to Courtney and go why doesn't  Courtney deserve the million dollars? What has she done? <br/>Courtney's voted the same as me pretty much the whole time. I mean, I may have made the lies up and coordinated them. She's voted with me, so she's just as much of a liar as I am. <br/>Except I didn't lie to you all. I just went along. <br/>She just went along. That's it. <br/>Not vote for her! <br/>The reason why you should not vote for Courtney...  Yes. <br/>...is because she didn't want to be here in the first place. <br/>So do you think she deserves it at all or do you think...  I think I deserve it more than her. <br/>Okay, great. Now, Amanda, is there anything about Courtney that we should know that makes  her undeserving of a million dollars? <br/>I'm just going to be honest. I came into this and...  I don't want...  I know. <br/>Okay. <br/>I feel like Courtney is ungrateful. When she'd come back from rewards, she'd just complain. And I... honestly, at the beginning, I didn't feel like Courtney deserved to  be here because I didn't feel like she put her heart into anything she did  here. And that's just honest. <br/>Okay. What about Todd? <br/>Um, I feel like Todd is a great strategic player of this game, but I feel if  he's that good of a strategic player, why didn't he play this game better to  where he didn't have to deceive and lie to all these people? He lied too much for me. <br/>I don't know if I'd make an alliance...  Okay, now, Todd, this is your chance. <br/>Right. <br/>You just heard what Amanda said about you. Do you... first of all, is what she said legit, or was there strategics  behind you lying? <br/>I mean, yeah, I told more lies, and yeah, I made more, you know, like,  "Let's go far togethers" than Amanda. But I did the dirty work for the nice girl. <br/>And Courtney, do you think she rode your coattail and the only reason she's  here is because of you? <br/>I would say that they definitely played their game strategically, but I  played mine more strategically. <br/>Okay, that's fair enough. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Jaime. <br/>Probst: Thanks, Jaime. Denise, you're up. Denise, you're up. <br/>I'm glad y'all can look me in the eye. That's nice. I'm just up here. I mean, I'm a lunch lady. I dedicate my whole life to being honest, to being fair. You guys all came up to me. You all shook my hand. You all looked me in the face. You all said, "You're with us." None of you wanted to be standing up  next to me. You didn't want to go up there. You thought I would play the kid game. I believe that the jury would have voted for me. But because I'm standing here and I'm not sitting over there, someone has to  give it to you now. So this is what I'm going to do. Amanda has lied, even though she said that "I don't lie. I'm not going to lie. I'm an honorable person." You have lied. You have not only lied to me. You've lied to Jean-Robert. You've lied to Frosti. You've lied to James. Todd, he has such a deceptive side to him that, you know, you never know when  he's telling the truth. You know, if you have these things in you that you can do that to people  without even thinking about it, without ever batting an eye, your conscience  needs to be cleaned. You need to turn over a new leaf. You need to look inside yourself as well and realize what you do that affects  a lot of people. Courtney, you're a very honest person. You're very outgoing. You say what you mean. You mean what you say. I can respect that. <br/>Thanks, guys. <br/>Thanks, guys. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: All right, jury, you've had your say. Amanda, Todd, Courtney, you've had your say. Let me give you a minute to let it all sink in, and then we will it all sink  in, and then we will vote. vote. <br/>Probst: All right, Amanda, Todd, Courtney, you've made your case to the jury. The jury's had their chance to address you. One thing left to do, and that is vote. Jury, tonight, you are voting for a winner. You are writing down the name of the person you think most deserving of the  title of sole survivor and the million-dollar check that goes with it, the  last time it is time to vote. last time it is time to vote. Jaime, you're up. Jaime, you're up. <br/>You did not have my vote coming into this. I'm very impressed with your answers this evening, and that's why you got my  vote. why you got my vote. So congratulations. So congratulations. <br/>I relate to your struggle with being honest in this game. I think you played the best, well-rounded game. So congratulations, wish you the So congratulations, wish you the best. best. <br/>Courtney, I picked you because you always tried to tell me the truth and you  overcame the most odds. Good job.
