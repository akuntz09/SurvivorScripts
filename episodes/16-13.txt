<br/> <br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor: Erik was the last man left  in the game. And the women's alliance desperately wanted him out.  <br/>It's us and Erik.  <br/>We need to figure out what we need to do.  <br/>Jeff: But when he won the immunity challenge, Erik threw a  wrench into their plans.  <br/>What are we all thinking?  <br/>I couldn't win against Amanda.  <br/>Jeff: So Natalie, Alexis, and Erik decided to vote out  Amanda.  <br/>âª Da, da, da, da.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie was still tight with Amanda and Parvati, but  reluctant to force a tie.  <br/>So what do I do, make it a  <br/>So what do I do, make it a tie? tie?  <br/>You know that I would.  <br/>Jeff: At tribal council, Amanda tore into Erik for turning  his back on her.  <br/>I helped you stay here through the merge, and then I was  asking for your help, and you clearly denied me of that.  <br/>Jeff: Then Amanda pulled off the biggest blindside yet by  playing the hidden immunity idol.  <br/>âª But I got it.  <br/>Jeff: The rest of the tribe was stunned as Alexis was sent  home. Alexis, the tribe has spoken. Only five are left. Only five are left.  Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight?  <br/>I didn't have it when I told you guys I didn't have it. I  got it afterwards.  <br/>Whoo-ee, tribal council, boy, is getting dangerous, from  the idols floating around and people using them and not using them. You want  me to make a fire?  <br/>Can do you it in the dark?  <br/>I mean, Amanda put me through the wringer. She is good,  though, because she had me right at the brink of being willing to make it a  tie vote. You know, I guess that's what she needed to see to know that she  can trust me. she can trust me.  <br/>It was a pretty wild night.  <br/>It was a pretty wild night.  <br/>They took out Alexis. That's... if Parvati and Cirie are  smart, they'll recognize that Amanda is very popular with the jury, and they  won't take her.  <br/>It just doesn't make sense for anyone to take her to the  final three. It doesn't make any sense.  <br/>Yeah. I would like to see Amanda just... outie. At tribal  council, Amanda made me feel like a fool, and I definitely am pissed off  about that. But everything can be switched up with the hidden immunity idol.  I want us to find the hidden immunity idol. That's the problem with Exile  Island, though, because if they win, they can send anybody. And I don't know  if they would send me. To go to Exile Island at this point, you have to find  that idol, because it's the last chance you get to use it. So whoever gets  the idol, that's pretty much like winning individual immunity. And then if I  win, like if I win... I'm going to try and win. Okay. Okay.  <br/>And if I win you want me to send you? I mean, that's in  our best interest right now.  <br/>I think so, yes. You need to. Probably... like, I don't  want to go, because it's Exile, but we have to at this point. At this point,  I'm weighing the pros and cons of different choices I could make in this  game. I might have to listen to Natalie and go with Natalie. But nothing is  set in stone right now. I mean, everything is just... it's still moving, it's  still kind of evolving. So at this point I don't trust anybody in this game.  I really can't 100% trust anybody. anybody. But I do have to pick sides. But  I do have to pick sides.

He's going.  <br/>Exactly. That's what I'm thinking. I don't really have a  question mark about Cirie anymore. I pretty much tested her trust when... she  was pretty much ready to pick rocks, so I'm not too worried about Cirie's  loyalty. You know, I trust my girls again. I trust Parv and Cirie, and it's I  trust Parv and Cirie, and it's us three to the end. us three to the  end.  <br/>It matters if he wins...  <br/>I know. We don't want Erik or Natalie going to Exile,  because if one of them gets the hidden immunity idol, it could be the end of  the game for me, Parvati, or Cirie.  <br/>Erik is whoever gets to him first. It Amanda could get in  his head that she forgives him...  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>...he'll do whatever she  <br/>...he'll do whatever she says. says.  <br/>You. Mm-hmm. Yeah, talk to him. Yeah, talk to him. Try to  get him... Try to get him...  <br/>So, what are your thoughts now about things going  on?  <br/>I'm looking to whatever this reward is. And... I don't  know. I feel like I could win it, like I want to win it, because I am  starving. I feel like it's going to be food.  <br/>Amanda is a very, very strategic player. So I don't know  if I can trust her after she ripped me over the coals at the last tribal  council. And now she is pushing for herself to go with me on the  reward.  <br/>I'm not going out of this game without a fight.  <br/>Right.  <br/>And I think it's better that we team up, you being the  most physical player on the team and me the most strategic and battle against  the odds rather than...  <br/>Than play into what they're doing.  <br/>...possibly lose a challenge and be out.  <br/>That's how I do feel. I feel very stressed.  <br/>You think? Me, too.  <br/>It's true.  <br/>Erik's very, very naive, so I think I can definitely  manipulate his mind into sending Parvati to Exile.  <br/>What are your thoughts on Exile today? Natalie was pushing  for me to possibly go. Like, she wanted me to go.  <br/>Of course she wants you to.  <br/>And I don't want to go at all.  <br/>Because she wants you to be weaker for the next  challenge.  <br/>I don't want to go there at all.  <br/>You're playing a physical game. Why would you weaken  yourself?  <br/>That's true.  <br/>It doesn't make any sense.  <br/>True.  <br/>Why not send Parvati? Parvati is so weak right now, she  won't even want to look for it. She'll just sit there on the island.  <br/>It's really weird, because I feel like I have some kind of  choice to make on the fact that I'm starting to win some challenges, and now  I feel like it's basically Natalie and Amanda who are trying to talk me into  some different plan. So it's very... who do you trust? Who do you really  trust here?  <br/>You're good at thinking, Erik. Like, you're almost there  sometimes.  <br/>Almost there. I mean, it's not all hair up on I mean, it's  not all hair up on my head. my head. my head.  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Sweet.  <br/>You guys ready to get to your challenge?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: Today's challenge is going to test how well you know  this game you love so well. For today's challenge, I'm going to ask you  questions about favorite moments from past seasons of Survivor. Every time  you get one right, you score a point. First to four wins reward. Want to know  what you're playing for?  <br/>Yes!  <br/>Jeff: The winner of this challenge will board a  helicopter. You will take a beautiful flight over the rock islands. You will  land at a luxury resort.  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>Jeff: Massage, meal.  <br/>Meal!  <br/>Jeff: You'll return to camp in the morning. In addition,  the winner of the challenge will send one person to Exile Island. Because  Amanda played the hidden immunity idol at the last tribal council, there is  yet another hidden immunity idol. The last time you can use the hidden  immunity idol is the next tribal council. That means you have one chance to  find the idol, one time to play it. Big enough stakes?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Jeff: All right, we'll get started. All right, first  question. On which season of Survivordid On which season of Survivordid a  castaway have a pet snake? a castaway have a pet snake? Everybody locked in?  Cirie makes a last-minute change, and it's a good thing she did. The correct  answer is Pearl Islands. Cirie gets it right. Erik gets it right. Rupert had  a pet snake named Balboa. One point Cirie, one point Erik. Next question. In  which season of Survivordid a shark bite a survivor, and in retaliation the  survivor bit it back? If you are a fan of this game, you should know this.  Erik says it was the first season of Survivor. That is not right. Parvati and  Cirie says Palau. Palau is wrong. Natalie and Amanda say Survivor All-Stars.  All-Stars is right. Amanda and Natalie both score a point. Richard Hatch got  bitten by a shark and he bit it back.  <br/>His teeth, right there, he's got me.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie, Amanda, Natalie, and Erik all with one.  Playing to four. Next question: In which season of Survivordid a tribemate  ask another tribemate to pee on their hand after being stung by a sea urchin?  If you saw the season, you'll remember this moment. One person got it right.  The correct answer was Survivor: Marcasis. Erik, the only one to get it  right. John asked Kathy to pee on his hand after being stung by a sea  urchin.  <br/>I need somebody who can pee on my hand. Okay, okay.  <br/>Jeff: Erik moves into the lead with two. Cirie, Amanda,  Natalie with one. Parvati with zero. Next question. During which season of  Survivor was one of the castaways evacuated after falling into the evacuated  after falling into the fire? fire? Cirie, Parvati, and Erik all say Survivor:  Australia. Erik is nodding, certain he's right. The correct answer is  Survivor: Australia. Michael fell in the fire.  <br/>You're coming right now.  <br/>Jeff: That was 2001. Erik was 14 years old. Proof of your  superfan status. Erik now in the lead with three, Cirie with two, Parvati,  Amanda, and Natalie with one. Next question. Erik, get this one right, you  win reward. During which season of Survivordid we first divide the castaways  into four separate tribes? When was the first time we divided the castaways  into four divided the castaways into four separate tribes? separate tribes?  Parvati and Amanda both say the Cooks. Both wrong. Cirie, Natalie, and Erik  all say Exile Island. For the first time ever, you have been divided into  four tribes by age and gender. Exile islandis correct. Erik wins  reward.  <br/>Survivor!  <br/>Spin it, baby.  <br/>Jeff: Nice job.  <br/>Thank you.  <br/>Jeff: Okay, first decision. Who you sending to Exile  Island? Big strategy at this point.  <br/>I'm pretty sure that I want to send Parvati to Exile  Island.  <br/>Bye, guys.  <br/>Jeff: Parvati, boat's waiting for you. All right, Erik,  next decision. You have three people left. You're going to choose one person  to go with you.  <br/>Before the challenge, I gave Amanda my word that I would  take her. And if she won, she had her word that she would take me. So I'm  going to pick Amanda.  <br/>Jeff: Come on over, Amanda.  <br/>Thank you for keeping your  <br/>Thank you for keeping your word. word.  <br/>Jeff: All right, Cirie, Natalie, grab your stuff. Head  back to camp. I got nothing for you.  <br/>Bye, guys.  <br/>Jeff: Erik, Amanda, nice reward-- massage, nice meal, good  night's sleep.  <br/>Yes! High five.  <br/>Jeff: Helicopter's waiting for you. Enjoy it. Enjoy it.  Head on out. Head on out.  <br/>Well, that was a doozy.  <br/>Mm-hmm. I'm so upset. Just stunned. Like, if Erik  seriously wanted to get Amanda out, it would have been a sure-fire thing to  send me to Exile, not Parvati. Had a reward challenge. Erik won. I was hoping  for him to win, considering the conversation we had this morning about it. He  said he'd send me to Exile or take me on the reward. Well, Parvati's on  Exile, and he chooses to take Amanda on the reward, which adds up not one  iota.  <br/>Erik is a little weasel. To me, where do his loyalties lie  if he told you he'd take you, and he told her he'd take her, and he took her,  but she's the one he's going to vote out? I was kind of just yanking Natalie  around a little bit, which is fun for me because it's killing her. She thinks  she has Erik in her pocket. You do not feed and take care of the person that  you plan on beating in the next immunity challenge to make sure that she's  the one he's going to vote out. I mean, maybe that's a new tactic that I  don't know about.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>"Let me make you as strong as possible so I can vote  you out." The only pleasure I'm getting out of today in not going on the  reward is seeing Natalie stress out over Erik taking Amanda and Parvati being  on Exile.  <br/>Looks like a rat, smells like a rat.  <br/>Give it cheese.  <br/>Yeah. Is that them? Is that them?  <br/>Where?  <br/>Where?  <br/>Natalie out there?  <br/>They're waving.  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>Yeah, they were.  <br/>Oh, look at this view!  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>This is awesome! Woo!  <br/>Woo!  <br/>I'm really glad that you came with me, that I chose you.  Honestly, I would want a friend on this trip rather than a stranger.  <br/>I feel the same way.  <br/>I know I didn't do what Natalie wanted me to do. If I  brought Natalie, there would be no relaxation, I don't feel, and there was a  part of me that legitimately wanted to spend time with Amanda and just get to  know her more as a friend again.  <br/>Oh, my god!  <br/>I want to enjoy this as much as I can. And I feel like I'm  thinking about the game way too much, and, thinking, "Is Amanda  manipulating you, are you manipulating Amanda, whatever?" And I don't  want to think about And I don't want to think about that at all. that at  all.  <br/>Woo-hoo!  <br/>Woo-hoo!  <br/>Woo!  <br/>Woo!  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Oh, my god.  <br/>This is the best reward ever.  <br/>Oh, yes.  <br/>Put them in.  <br/>Oh, my god. We're getting foot treatments.  <br/>Whatever you're doing to the toes... I've never been to a  spa in my life.  <br/>Really?  <br/>Never been to a spa in my  <br/>Never been to a spa in my life. life.  <br/>I feel like ever since I got immunity last time, like,  I'm, like, the center of all that's going on.  <br/>Well, you kind of are.  <br/>People are coming to me to ask me, "What decision do  you want to make?" And I'm just like, "I work in an ice cream  parlor. I don't do this. I don't make these decisions about  people."  <br/>Why not?  <br/>I just...  <br/>It's good to be in a power position.  <br/>I'm just not used to it. I'm going to kick myself probably  for whatever choices that I made today, but I'm trying to go with what I  have. I'm trying to go with what I can see right now and make the best  decision. I just need to step up, I think. I mean, that's part of being a  man, being an ice cream man man, being an ice cream man instead of an ice  cream boy. instead of an ice cream boy.  <br/>I got here to Exile, and it's gorgeous. It's paradise for  me. This is kind of like my own little private vacation. I love it, because I  really needed this time to just chill, maybe get a little tan, maybe look for  the idol if I want to. If I don't want to, I don't have to, because the  reason for me being here is just to prevent Natalie and Erik from getting a  chance at getting the idol. So it doesn't really matter if I find the idol or  not, because Cirie, Amanda, and me, we have Cirie, Amanda, and me, we have  the numbers. the numbers.  <br/>I hate feeling bitter when people come back from rewards.  But you just can't help it.  <br/>I'm not bitter about that. I'm bitter about... well, we  promised each other if we won we'd take each other. What?  <br/>Where is everybody?  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>Probably sleeping.  <br/>Oh, yeah.  <br/>Oh, yeah. I think that's them. I think that's them.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Look who's back. Bitches. Don't try to look pitiful. I  know it was absolutely wonderful. I won that same challenge in my season. So  I don't want to hear that it wasn't fun and y'all didn't wake up at 3:00 AM  and eat more food.  <br/>We actually didn't eat more food.  <br/>You should have. That's what we did.  <br/>They had just dinner. Like, you pick from the list.  <br/>We had, like, a waitress.  <br/>I wish we all could have  <br/>I wish we all could have gone. gone.  <br/>Returning to camp was very bad. I come back to camp, and  Natalie didn't even look at me. She doesn't even talk to me. It's no longer  sunshine and happiness. I mean, she obviously had I mean, she obviously had  resentment. resentment. I know Nat is pissed off at me for a lot of  reasons.  <br/>Yeah. I guess she thinks you should have taken her, but  she did... see, I don't know. Because she did say she wanted to go to  Exile.  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>And I guess she feels like if you were going to vote  Amanda out, how would you take her on a reward?  <br/>I feel regardless of what happens right now, I'm going to  piss somebody off.  <br/>See, that's the thing.  <br/>I'm either going to piss off Nat or piss off Amanda right  now for sure.  <br/>Do you think if Natalie was sitting next to you she would  beat you hands down, or you think if Amanda was sitting next to you she'd  beat you hands down?  <br/>That's what I have to think about.  <br/>That's the question.  <br/>I feel like me, you, and Parvati are still on the fence,  because we don't know which one is most likely to win all the votes. We think  that both of them have a really good chance. So maybe me, you, and Parv  should go to the end and do that instead.  <br/>That would mean we would get rid of who?  <br/>Either Nat or Amanda.  <br/>God, this idiot. I literally walked right in front of Erik  and heard his entire conversation with Cirie about how Natalie and Amanda are  the biggest jury vote threats. Everybody's going to vote for them on the jury  so they can't go to the final three. You know what? I could have literally  bitchslapped him, smack him like his slapped him, smack him like his mother.  mother.  <br/>What just happened just now?  <br/>I just overheard a complete conversation.  <br/>He just told me that it would probably be beneficial for  me, him, and Parv to go to the end.  <br/>I'm not surprised. Am I surprised? No, I know this is him.  See, the problem with Erik's strategy is that there's five people left, and  four of them are women. And when you go to each woman and you tell her  something different, pretty soon the women are going to talk.  <br/>Idiot.  <br/>I might have screwed up quite a bit. I've been telling  these girls all these different things, and I walked up on all three of them  talking to each other, and I'm worried. worried. I'm definitely worried. I'm  definitely worried. I feel like all of the women here think I'm full of  crap.  <br/>Don't you know everyone is going to talk? going to  talk?  <br/>Yeah, I know.  <br/>Yeah, I know.  <br/>Well, you need to pick one side or the other. You can't  keep flipping. You don't want to be with me because you think I'm a threat.  And then you want to vote me out. And then all of a sudden, we're, like, best  friends. And then I hear from everyone else that you still are planning on  voting me out.  <br/>I make so many mistakes. I know the girls don't trust me  at all. And I'm scared I'm the next to go. I can't stress how important it is  that I win the next immunity. Right now it's just like the animal kingdom.  It's either you win and survive It's either you win and survive or you fail  and you die. or you fail and you die. or you fail and you die.  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys! I'll now bring in Parvati, I'll  now bring in Parvati, returning from Exile Island. returning from Exile  Island.  <br/>Hey, Parv.  <br/>Jeff: You guys ready to get to today's challenge? Erik,  I'll take back the necklace once again.  <br/>Here you go.  <br/>It's good to see you.  <br/>Hi, baby!  <br/>Hi!  <br/>Hey, girl.  <br/>Jeff: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For  today's challenge, you will work to solve three puzzles. Using a set of  coordinates, you will cross two ropes. Where the ropes intersect, you'll dig  down to find a bag of puzzle pieces. Race back to your answer board, solve  the puzzle. That puzzle will give you your next set of coordinates, leading  you to another bag of puzzle pieces. The first person to solve all three  puzzles wins immunity, and is guaranteed a spot in the final four. Losers,  after 36 days, somebody will be going home. We'll draw for lanes, we'll get  We'll draw for lanes, we'll get started. started. Here we go, for immunity  and a guaranteed spot in the final four. Survivors ready. Survivors ready.  Go! Go!

And with this around  your neck, are you safe at tonight's tribal council. Erik is guaranteed a  spot in the final four. Amanda, Natalie, Parvati, Cirie, for one of you, your  shot at the million dollars will come to an end tonight at tribal council.  Grab your stuff. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Head back to camp.  <br/>I just want you guys to tell me.  <br/>Tell you what?  <br/>Just tell me if it's... if it's me.  <br/>The way it's looking, probably.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yesterday, he worked us all like cheap suits. He told us  all three same thing.  <br/>Wow.  <br/>Busted.  <br/>He got busted?  <br/>Mm-hmm.  <br/>That sucks that he won! God. If he didn't have that  necklace, If he didn't have that necklace, he'd be gone. he'd be gone.  Probably not, huh?  <br/>What?  <br/>If he would give you his necklace. Do you think you could  talk him into giving you the necklace?  <br/>Nat, work your magic. You can convince him to give it to  you.  <br/>Why would it benefit him giving me the necklace?  <br/>Say, "I'll convince the jury..." you know,  "They'll know everything you've done. They're not going to vote for you  anyways. Everyone is mad at you at this point." You know, "This is  one way you can redeem yourself." Just go off.  <br/>Nat, tell him if he were to give you the necklace, that  would redeem him, and we would vote for Amanda.  <br/>Who would fall for that? Like, I feel stupid listening to  you right now.  <br/>Ozzy, Jason, and Erik. He belongs in that threesome. He  belongs in that trio.  <br/>You're good at this, Nat.  <br/>Yeah, but, I mean, this is just ridiculous. I mean, I'll  try it, but... I'll say I talked to Cirie about it, she's down with voting  Amanda.  <br/>But the only way I'll go along is if he saves you.  <br/>Right, right, right, right.  <br/>Because I don't believe him. I have to see him save you to  believe that he'll vote Amanda, because of all the stuff he's been saying.  Perfect.  <br/>I think it could work.  <br/>It depends on how good you  <br/>It depends on how good you are with this right here. are  with this right here.  <br/>Honestly, I'm on my way home packing tonight. But I had  the most harebrained idea.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>I'll run it by you, you make your decision.  <br/>Harebrained. I can relate.  <br/>It's crazy.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>But it's brilliant. Myself or Amanda are your biggest  threats, right? That's who you want...  <br/>That's how I feel.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Well, what if me, you, and Cirie vote Amanda  tonight?  <br/>Okay.  <br/>This is where it gets funny and tricky. You give me your  necklace.  <br/>I'm not even going to consider that.  <br/>Just hear me out. If you give me your necklace tonight,  Cirie said she would hands down vote for Amanda. That's all we need.  <br/>What's wrong with voting for Amanda without me giving up  the necklace? Everybody thinks I'm an idiot right now.  <br/>I'm just thinking jury votes for you. Because you're  riding this thing all the way to the end.  <br/>When I get there, I'm not going to have anybody.  <br/>Right. We were thinking you redeem yourself with the jury.  I just think it would be a huge, pivotal move for you. Because you're going  to need a pivotal move if you want a jury vote.  <br/>Mm-hmm. I have felt like I don't have a lot of jury  votes.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>All right, let me talk to  <br/>All right, let me talk to Cirie. Cirie.  <br/>At this point, Amanda is a threat. There's no question.  What is the problem with me keeping immunity and still voting Amanda?  <br/>Because I don't... I don't know if I would believe that  you would vote Amanda.  <br/>Right.  <br/>I wish I could, like, trust you in the fact of just you  saying it, but you kind of...  <br/>Blew that up.  <br/>...took that all away.  <br/>My word isn't good anymore.  <br/>No.  <br/>And I'm all sketchy.  <br/>Exactly.  <br/>I'm like this.  <br/>So what do I do? Do I... that's why it has to be that way.  I mean, I know it's hard to ask somebody to give up immunity, but for me, if  you were to save Nat, then I would believe you, and that would cue me that  we're all going to vote Amanda. We've thrown the line out to Erik, and I  think he's nibbling around the edges.  <br/>I have to think about it.  <br/>Yeah, of course, I'm sure. If Erik takes that necklace  off, his torch would be snuffed so quick, I don't even think he could have  time to blink his eyes. Oh, I just don't know, you know? Erik is a pretty  smart guy. So it's like a 50-50 shot. Him being blasted at tribal could push  him over the edge. Even if he doesn't make up his mind before we go, at  tribal, you and Parvati blast him, and me and Natalie won't so he can be  thinking, like, "Maybe this will be a good move."  <br/>Okay.  <br/>That's all I want to say. I don't want him to see me I  don't want him to see me talking to you. talking to you.  <br/>I'm scared about immunity, the hidden immunity. Because I  feel like Parvati found it, and she has it, and she's going to give it to  Amanda. What is the possibility that you guys will vote Parv with me instead  of Amanda?  <br/>Well, if it makes more sense and you feel more comfortable  going a different route.  <br/>Right. Like, I feel like all the girls like, "Let's  get Erik."  <br/>I get your concern. I get you having to angle out every  possible angle. I get it.  <br/>I'm still scared... I'm just being honest. That's my  fear.  <br/>No, I get it, but just go out on a limb. Go out on a limb.  Go out on a limb.  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>I don't know.  <br/>He's worried about the hidden immunity, and he would feel  much better if the three of us voted for Parv. He is afraid Parv's going to  pull the idol.  <br/>All right, I'll agree with anything right now. Girl, we've  got him on a hook. We've got him on the hook. We've just got to reel him in.  It would be the ultimate Jedi mind trick. I just don't know-- will he buy I  just don't know-- will he buy it? it?  <br/>Jeff: We'll now bring in the members of our jury. Eliza,  Ozzy, Jason, James, and Alexis, voted out at the last tribal council. Erik,  let's talk about the reward challenge. You decide to bring Amanda with you  after she had completely worked you at the last tribal council.  <br/>Well, I felt like I needed to redeem myself, and I felt  like that she could see it as some kind of nice gesture to kind of bury the  hatchet.  <br/>Jeff: So, Parvati, tell me about your time on Exile.  <br/>It ended up being, like, a little nice mini-vacation for  me. But when I got back from Exile, I heard about Erik running around and  making alliances with every single person, and then breaking their alliances,  and then switching back up, and switching back over, when he didn't even need  to do that. He'd won immunity for the past three times in a row. So I was  happy to be on Exile, actually, to be away from that.  <br/>Jeff: Erik, what's it feel like to hear Parvati out you,  saying you made alliances with everybody here, you lied to everybody here,  and all the women are nodding their head going, "Yep, yep, yep,  yep"?  <br/>I was nodding my head with them, because everyone  basically turned around and went to each other and said, "Hey, Erik's  full of crap. Erik's telling everybody what they want to hear." It was  stupid. It was just a mistake. And I feel like I need to come to this tribal  tonight and ask for some kind of forgiveness, some kind of "I'm  sorry."  <br/>The thing, is Erik your word means nothing to anybody  anymore at all.  <br/>Exactly.  <br/>You say you're sorry, and, like, take me on a reward, and  that's great and all, but you only took me to get my vote on the jury. And  not only that, but everything that you were telling me on the reward you've  told her, you've told her, you've told her.  <br/>Well, that's what I'm coming forward about right now.  That's what I'm trying to say right now.  <br/>But it's too late! Don't you see?  <br/>I mean, you've just lost a lot of respect among the women  here you're sitting with.  <br/>I know this. It's not like I can't... and I'm not going to  deny it right now. I'm not going to pretend I did not say the things that I  said.  <br/>Because you can't!  <br/>Because I can't, exactly. I mean, game aside, I'm hoping  there's some sense of forgiveness, some sense of, "We'll try and trust  you again."  <br/>You can't say, "Game aside," because we're  playing this game.  <br/>That's true.  <br/>We're in this game right now. You can't say, "Game  aside, I apologize." This is the game.  <br/>I'm sorry. I am sorry. I just want to tell you that, if it  means anything at all.  <br/>Jeff: Erik, what's it going to take for you to actually  win this game?  <br/>That's been a question that's concerned me. I mean, I'm  looking down the road here to the final, and I don't see any friendly faces.  I don't see anybody on the jury that's going to say, "Hey, you did a  pretty good job." Or, "You didn't backstab me," or, "You  didn't lie to my face." And especially after what I did to piss  everybody off here. I mean, I need some kind of redemption before I can have  a chance of considering myself in the finals.  <br/>Jeff: Cirie, is it realistic to say, "I'm  sorry?" Does it matter if you redeem yourself?  <br/>I think it does matter, Jeff, because, ultimately, it lies  in the hands of the people who are voted out this late and become jury  members. So I think you are able to redeem yourself, and I think it's really  important that you do, especially if you've been discredited. If you've been  discredited, the words you say means absolutely nothing. It's your actions  that will show and prove what's really going on.  <br/>Jeff: All right, let's get to the vote. Erik, you have the  individual immunity necklace. As always, you can give it up to somebody if  you choose to. Otherwise, it is yours, and you are safe tonight.  <br/>This is a very tough decision for me, for a lot of  reasons. As a competitor, I always say, "You know what? Keep your fate  in our own hands." But there is so much weighing on my mind. I've made a  lot of mistakes in the past couple days. And I know that actions do speak  louder than words. I want to give individual I want to give individual  immunity to Natalie. immunity to Natalie.  <br/>Jeff: Suddenly, Natalie, you are safe. Big change right  before the vote. Natalie is now safe from the vote. Everybody else is fair  game. And it is time to vote. And it is time to vote. Erik, you're up. Erik,  you're up.  <br/>I'm voting for Parvati. You've got to take some risks  sometime and hope people keep their word. their word. Oh, god! Oh, god!  <br/>I don't even know what to say. say. But thank you. But  thank you. But thank you.  <br/>You know...  <br/>You know...  <br/>My mother always told me, "You may not be able to  beat them with these all time, but you can always beat them with this."  this." Sorry. Sorry.  <br/>You're crazy! You officially go down as the dumbest  survivor ever in the dumbest survivor ever in the history of Survivor,ever.  history of Survivor,ever.  <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the  <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. votes.  <br/>Jeff: If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want  to play it, now would be want to play it, now would be the time to do so. the  time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final. The  person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.  council area immediately. I'll read the votes.

You need to bring me your torch.  <br/>You guys drive me crazy.  <br/>I've lost my reign as dumbest survivor ever. survivor  ever.  <br/>I should have known better.  <br/>I should have known better.  <br/>Jeff: Erik, the tribe has  <br/>Jeff: Erik, the tribe has spoken. spoken.  <br/>Jeff: I think that is what you call a life lesson.
