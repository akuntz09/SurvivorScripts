<br/>Probst: We're on board the fishing trawler Amaryllis, making our way through the very rough waters of the South Pacific. Down below, deep inside the hold of this ship, 16 Americans, about to be abandoned in the middle of the Marquesas, part of Tahiti's mystical islands. Thousands of miles from the nearest continent, this will be their home for the next 39 days. But this time the game is different. These survivors will be given no food, absolutely no rations. Each tribe will leave the ship with only the barest of essentials: two machetes, two cooking pots, two empty water containers, one frying pan, one filet knife, and one magnifying glass. They'll be left to fend for themselves using the resources of the land and their own survival skills. It is the ultimate challenge: 16 strangers forced to work together to create a new society while battling the elements and each other. They must learn to adapt or they'll be voted out of the tribe. In the end, only one will remain to claim the million-dollar prize. 39 days, 16 people... one survivor. <br/>Probst: As this ship drops anchor, these 16 Americans began the adventure of a lifetime. They have never spoken to each other, and have been divided into the two competing tribes: Maraamu and Rotu, Tahitian words for "wind" and "rain." Each tribe will be given a crate which holds a minimal amount of supplies, but no food and no water. They then face a difficult twomile paddle to their beaches and their new homes for the next 39 days. [ shouting] Okay! <br/>Woo! <br/>Let's get away from the boat. <br/>Over here. <br/>Probst: The Rotu Tribe, which will always wear blue, consists of Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien, a real estate agent from Burlington, Vermont; Gabriel Cade, a bartender from Celo, North Carolina; Tammy Leitner, a crime reporter from Mesa, Arizona; Paschal English, a judge from Thomaston, Georgia; John Carroll, a registered nurse from Omaha, Nebraska; Neleh Dennis, a student from Layton, Utah. Zoe Zanidakis, a fishing boat captain from Monhegan Island, Maine; and Robert DeCanio, a limousine driver from Queens, New York. The Maraamu Tribe, which will always wear yellow, consists of Gina Crews, a nature guide from Gainesville, Florida; Sean Rector, a teacher from Harlem, New York; Sarah Jones, an account manager from Newport Beach, California; Rob Mariano, a construction worker from Canton, Massachusetts; Vecepia Towery, an office manager from Portland, Oregon; Peter Harkey, a bowling alley owner from Millis, Massachusetts; Patricia Jackson, a truck assembler from Lugoff, South Carolina; and Hunter Ellis, a Federal Express pilot from La Jolla, California. <br/>One, two, three, four, five. California. <br/>One, two, three, four, five. <br/>Guess what. We haven't moved at all in, like, the last half hour. <br/>We were making zero progress. I don't know how long we were out there, but every one of us were totally exhausted. <br/>I think we're going exactly .2 miles per hour. <br/>Okay, don't stop rowing! <br/>One... two... three... four. Over to that cliff. <br/>Really well, excellent work. <br/>Rotu, Rotu. Rotu, Rotu. <br/>We were singing and trying to get some sort of rowing motion, you know, like on an old whaler there. And it really brought us together. <br/>...three... four... five... six... seven... We're getting there. <br/>...six, seven, eight. Woo! We made it! Can you believe it? <br/>My first thought when we hit the beach was, "Thank you, God, for letting us hit this beach." I was just happy to have made it. <br/>Everybody was so psyched. They were just running around and congratulating each other and we were thrilled. We made it. We made it the first part of the way. <br/>Wonderful to be here, guys. <br/>So our tribe is Rotu! [ cheering] It was great when we rounded that final corner. You know, we had seen a lot of coves, and we weren't sure if this was the one. We thought it was the one, and then finally to see the flag coming home-- it was great. [ cheering] Wave the flag! <br/>As we were coming in, last maybe 50 yards or so, we all made a concerted effort to give a last heave to make it to land, and it was quite evident that Sarah wasn't doing anything at all. Stroke, stroke. Kick, kick. Kick. Stroke, stroke. <br/>Sarah's arrival was almost like Cleopatra. It was like the servants are paddling and lifting and she's sitting on a crate looking so marvelous with her boobs hanging out and her Goldilocks in the air. <br/>Woo-hoo! <br/>Save it, you know? This is Survivor. Nobody trying to look at you like that here. <br/>Home sweet home. <br/>Yes! <br/>When we first arrived on land, I can't even describe it. It was beyond words. First of all, I had never been on an ocean, ever. I mean, in the hood, ain't a lot of pools, you know, probably don't really swim too much. <br/>How you doing, man? Are you going to make it? <br/>It's emotional when I think about the miracles that God has performed for me. We didn't do this on our own. He definitely... his Hand was under the raft guiding us. God, we thank you. We is in the ocean. And you led us here, God. <br/>Sean and Peter immediately bonded. They went into the water and they had their prayer Baptism revival. <br/>We can do all things through Christ. <br/>This told me that either Sean and Peter were either really playing the game starting real early, or they were definitely off their rockers. <br/>All these things, we pray, for your son, Jesus Christ, Amen. <br/>You guys ready to look in the box? <br/>Let's go do the box! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Woo! We got it! <br/>Oh, it's not as much as we thought! <br/>Our crate had no food. No food at all. <br/>I had no idea that this would be like this out here. But I mean, we're here. We know we have to survive and it's tough, so we just do whatever we can. <br/>Hey, hey, what's this? <br/>Hey, hey, hey. <br/>All right, what's this? <br/>Must be a map. A water map. <br/>The stuff that was in the crate-- we got a map to our water spot. We got, like, two pots and a pan, two machetes and a small knife, and then a magnifying glass. <br/>Woo! <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Woo! <br/>Let's get going. Let's build a fire. <br/>All right, we need tinder. <br/>We were soaking wet and we had a limited amount of daylight left, so our first thing was to get fire. <br/>Keep doing what you're doing. Good job. It's working. <br/>We landed so late. The sun was down; the clouds were up. <br/>Oh... That's a lot of cloud, too. <br/>I mean we tried and tried and tried, and it just didn't work. <br/>This is not going to work. <br/>Okay. <br/>And Kathy, she's like, "We have to have fire and we have to have it right now." So we tried the "two pieces of wood" method. <br/>Yeah, yeah, man! This is not going to work. <br/>Okay. <br/>Kathy slips very easily into the role of the skipper. Maybe it's her personality. Maybe it's the difficulty of being out here. I don't know. But we didn't need a skipper. <br/>All right, well, let's just rotate. All right, I'll be right back. <br/>We have been rotating. <br/>Keep going. Come on. Good. Go, Johnny, go. <br/>We were plowing, plowing, plowing and after rolling for all those hours, our arms were just spent. <br/>No. <br/>So we didn't get fire the first day, which sucked. <br/>I definitely knew this game was going to be hard when we got here and there was no food. There was nothing in the box. <br/>What's in there? We knew that if we didn't work as a team, one of us was going to starve to death. <br/>What's in this? <br/>That's a magnifying glass. <br/>If that's a magnifying glass we got about an hour to collect some wood and start a fire. <br/>Hunter's leadership role started when we got here. You know, immediately Hunter said we needed to, you know, stake out where we want to put the fire. <br/>Hey, you guys? We got a magnifying glass, so if we can collect a ton of firewood, we have only got about an hour and a half, two hours left. <br/>I'm already in love with Hunter. He's a great person. We have so much in common. Hunter knows a little bit about everything. <br/>I think the prevailing wind is going to probably switch and come from this direction. <br/>"The prevailing wind"? This is the weather station over here? <br/>I know you mean well, but you sound like, "a little bit of wind flowing to the east, but in the morning when we wake up, the sun will be up." My nickname for Hunter is MacGyver, simply because he got way too much energy for me out here. <br/>You know what I was thinking? If we can get some of the banana leaves, and if it starts to rain, we have the banana leaf funnel. <br/>You can drink rainwater, right? <br/>Out here he's going to turn into MacGyver. Everybody, let's make a funnel out of a banana plant so in the morning we can get the nutrients, because the winds will be blowing to the east. <br/>I see that Hunter is starting to be a focal point where everybody is going to check with him first. I'm a alpha male, too, so I find it hard to just follow somebody just blindly and keep going like they're my daddy. I'm not going to do that. They better know, I'm from Harlem and I'm representing. <br/>We got 40 minutes and that sun is behind the mountain. <br/>Sometimes the angle, the tilt of the lens. Tilt it a little bit. Okay. That's a good one. <br/>So I mean, it's so close. I tried my best for 15 minutes and actually, we got some smoke. We got some good smoke. We just couldn't get it completely going. <br/>The problem in lighting the fire is having maintain an air flow to keep it going. <br/>Peter, we need you over here. <br/>We got to have someone blowing. People know that I'm into yoga. You know, I did that about ten years ago, and in yoga, you breathe from the diaphragm, so I was able to take nice, long, deep breaths. [ blowing] Yeah! <br/>Come on. <br/>Woo-hoo! <br/>Yoga definitely helps with lighting the fire. <br/>We got fire! <br/>Here we go. <br/>Keep the fuel up. Keep the fuel up. Don't let it go out. <br/>Let's not let it go out. <br/>Robert rocks! [ chattering] Robert rocks! [ chattering] I want a monkey if I win any amount of money. I want a monkey. You want a monkey too? <br/>Yeah. You want a little curious George? <br/>Sarah has a very cute body. She paid a lot for it. And if you have it, of course flaunt it. I do not think that Sarah is using her body to get through this game, but I do think that if she connects with the right individual, then that will definitely help her get through. <br/>I want to go look at the bed. I didn't get to check it out. <br/>Who is going to sleep inside this? <br/>I don't got my shoes on. <br/>Right on top of it. <br/>I thought we were going to sleep in there. Is it comfy? <br/>Oh, yeah, it's like a waterbed. <br/>Oh! <br/>You all right? <br/>Oh, dude, I can go to sleep right now. <br/>Last night there was definitely flirtation around Rob and Sarah. <br/>We fill this thing up and let it cook in the sun all day tomorrow... There you go. <br/>We got a hot tub. <br/>That's an idea. <br/>Yeah, or just a little swimming pool, or whatever. <br/>Get some cocktails, too. You'll figure out a way. <br/>When we got into the raft that we had paddled in on and they kind of just hung out away from everybody else, and were there pretty much the whole darn night. So at that point in time, that was another question" what are they saying, you know? Are they flirting or are they making an alliance? And you shouldn't put yourself in that situation if you don't want people to think that. <br/>Anybody have any water? want people to think that. <br/>Anybody have any water? <br/>Are these all empty? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Oh, my gosh. <br/>That's five. <br/>When we first landed on the island we knew we were going to run out of water in a hurry. We each had one coconut full of water, which is about a liter, and you really need a gallon a day. <br/>Well, if we follow the river up we get to a little stream there. <br/>That's a good idea. <br/>[ whistles] Hey, you guys! This is the way. I found the way. I did not want to go into this being the blond bitchy person at all 'cause I'm really not. The only time I do get assertive is when I see that a critical job isn't getting done. Is that primeval or what? It's incredible. <br/>There's a waterfall! <br/>Are you kidding me? Woo! Start swimming, baby. <br/>Go, go, go. <br/>We were so excited when we found that waterfall, like, I saw it for the first time and I could not believe my eyes. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>Woo! <br/>Come on, guys! <br/>I was like, this is awesome! <br/>You tell me there's not a god. <br/>I don't want to go home. <br/>That waterfall was just, ah, it was like sanctuary. Damn, I think it's taro. We found a ton of taro, so we got food; we got water. These surroundings will give you everything, so you've gotta be close to Mother Earth now. If you never were before, now's the time. <br/>Now that we found this waterfall, it's dynamite, and then it's just the fire, that damn fire. So I'm just going to work on the fire when we get back. I'm going to work on it until it's dark. <br/>Stop. <br/>Oh, there it goes. Oh, sweet! <br/>This is grapefruit, right? It smells like grapefruit. When we open it up we can tell because we'll know what it looks like. <br/>Everybody, a toast. Cheers! To Maraamu. <br/>Maraamu! <br/>When I first arrived here I realized that we had no food at all, and I didn't want to be eating lemons and grapefruits the entire time we're here. [ rooster crowing] Did you hear that? Listen, can you hear that gobbling? Sounds like a turkey. Do you hear it? I'm being dead serious. I don't know if chickens make that sound too. So I decided that I would try to get some meat for us. There are chickens and pigs in this area. Yo, yo, yo, don't move. There's a chicken. I swear to God. He's got to come down, right? He's right up there. <br/>That thing is huge! <br/>Dude, that is dinner right there. Come on, we've got to get him down. I'll grab him and just snap him. Roosters can't fly, can they? <br/>I had no idea that roosters can fly. But this rooster took off like a 747. He was out of there. And that was it. <br/>Did you get him? Come on, chicken man. Did you get him? <br/>No. I know. I will. <br/>At times Rob is a little preoccupied with things that don't really pertain to the survival needs of the moment. He wants to chase chickens, I mean, I don't even think he knows how to clean a chicken. <br/>Maybe I don't have as much experience as you guys do with what needs to be done. <br/>That's why I was getting a little frustrated because if we collect a lot of firewood, if we get the water going, if we finish the shelter, once we've got all those things, then we do the luxury items. <br/>Hunter felt that I was spending too much time trying to hunt down meat and I needed to be around helping with the daily chores. One down. I realized that I'm going to have to work hard... Two down. ...to stay in the group now, and that this is essentially going to be my fate. <br/>It's so important to get fire. This is the most important thing right now, so we need to get a... But yesterday... We spent how many hours with that thing yesterday? I'm wiped. <br/>How many hours did we spend yesterday? <br/>You tell me. <br/>Not many, I don't think we spend more than two. <br/>Of course we know we have to get fire. But to have somebody, you know, "The sky is falling! The sky is falling!," it really started to become grating. <br/>I am not trying to be pushy here. <br/>No, no, no, I'm not saying you are. <br/>Okay, but our problem is huge. <br/>I'm saying right now I can't do that. <br/>Right, I'm not asking you to do it. <br/>You are asking. You're saying "It's imperative. We've got to get dynamic, blah, blah, blah." I'm just telling you I'm really tired. <br/>I'm not asking you to do it. <br/>This isn't going to solve anything here. <br/>I don't have any support here. And I'm frustrated that these people are being more cautious about this. <br/>I just don't like the urgency. You know, it's like, I'm working my butt off and just getting all panicky and stuff is frustrating. <br/>I'm Irish so I have that Irish temper and she sparked it and I did feel bad about it. So then now I became fixated on getting the fire to basically neutralize my outburst. So I was like, "Damn it. I'm starting a fire." Oh, sweet, sweet, sweet! <br/>Oh, we're not even getting full sun. You're going to get full sun in a second. Keep it going. You're going to get a big old blast. <br/>Oh, wow, there we go, baby. Here, sun, sun, sun. <br/>Nice. Yeah! <br/>Thank you! <br/>Yes! <br/>Fire! <br/>Yeah! <br/>You knew if you left those kids alone for a few minutes, we could do something right. <br/>Once we had the fire, then everything was forgotten, and she really started to come around with a personality, and attempting to bond. <br/>We got fire, girlfriend. I know it was important with you. <br/>Kathy. No, no. You put the fire under my butt, you take it. <br/>The nectar of gods. <br/>I think it's those two coconut trees right there. See? Large boulder. <br/>That's where we have to get the water from. <br/>Water, I wonder if we can go up this giant creek? We're going to go hike up to the water source. Go check it out. <br/>We got a little bit of an adventure, but the big thing is we need to get the water so we can start tackling all the other things without getting dehydrated. <br/>Do you think we go up more? <br/>No, no, this is it. We done looked. This is it. <br/>All right! Agua. And it bubbled up. This is the beginning of it. See it bubbling over there? <br/>Oh, that looks nice. <br/>Oh, yeah, we got water. Where's the other one? Mountain spring. Here. <br/>It was a huge relief that there was actually water there because it's the dry season now, so we were excited, got our water, came back to the fire and immediately started boiling. <br/>I'm a workaholic anyhow. immediately started boiling. <br/>I'm a workaholic anyhow. I caught myself trying to do too much. You know, everyone is trying to put their best face forward and trying to show that they're an integral part of the team, and all of a sudden I realized that I had to just, like, slow down. Then I went over and talked to Sean. Sean was great, you know. He's telling me to chill. <br/>Man, this feels so good. <br/>Are you chilling all? <br/>Under the shade, something with some support. We're chilling. Right? Isn't that what we're doing? <br/>We're chilling. You got to tell me some Harlem stuff. I want to go back and... Harlem stuff? That's not Harlem stuff, man. Well, give me some stuff to work with, for God's sakes! <br/>Where you going to use it? Where you going to use, uh... You going to walk up to a brother and go "Hey, I'm chilling." We talked and he almost, for me, reminded me simply of, you know, and it's really comfortable to be yourself. Then all of a sudden different tribe members came over and like we were having a real conversation. And it's nice to have real conversation with people. If someone said... all this la-di-da and it's simply to master every hole in your body, how you breathe, how you speak, how you see, how you hear, how you urinate, how you go to the bathroom and until you are aware of even that, most people around aren't even aware they have seven holes in their head. <br/>He looks like a normal guy, you know, but he's going on and on about being holy. And I'm thinking he's talking about spiritualness, but he's talking about actual holes in your body. I mean, he's a Froot Loop. <br/>The holes of your elimination, people don't like to talk about it, but, it's really, I mean, if you want to be holy, you might as well start with becoming aware. <br/>Of your holes. Holy. Holy. <br/>All right, I've had enough of this conversation. <br/>Then you're aware of what you're saying to people. <br/>I don't understand what you're talking about, not one thing. All of a sudden I loosen up, you know, be yourself. Sean did it to me. I'm chilling here. <br/>Ho, ho, ho! Oh, my, our first mail. <br/>We got mail! <br/>Should we all open it together? <br/>Yeah, here we go. Ooh! What is it? It's a message on a... Oh, crap, we're going to have to row some more. <br/>Oh, no! On the water? <br/>All right. Ready? Read it out loud. <br/>"You'll be in over your head to get to the flame. The weak ones will dread the thought of this game. It's a long tough trail. Avoid a rocky start. Fail to work as a team, you'll be the first to part. <br/>Ooh. <br/>Probst: Welcome. How was the journey over, Sean? <br/>Ha, y'all are crazy. [ laughter] Probst: Anybody have any luck with fire? <br/>Yeah! [ applause] Probst: Good, because in addition to no food, no water, you're getting no fire help from us at all of any kind at any time. That means if you have fire, treasure it, take care of it. When it rains, you better have a backup plan. There's no matches coming. This is what you want to covet. Everybody, put your hand on that. Everybody, get a little hand on this immunity idol. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: It is your first immunity challenge. Win it, your tribe is guaranteed another three days on the island. Lose, your tribe is going right there, Tribal Council, somebody is going to be the first person voted out. That brings us to today's challenge. Here's how it works. Each tribe has an outrigger canoe outfitted with two torches, so you're looking at about 300 pounds right now dry. On my "Go," you're going to take your canoe, run down the beach and then swim with it out in the ocean to the center wok, where you will light both of your torches. Treasure those torches. They're very important because you're going to turn around and start lighting your woks-- four-- as you make your way back toward the beach. Once you get to the beach, it's a sprint down a very uneven and very rocky beach where you will light three more torches. First tribe to reach the end, get their canoe back in the stand, and then light the final wok, wins immunity. You guys ready for this? <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Get ready to start. Wait for my "Go." This is for immunity. Survivors ready! Go! [ shouting] High, high, high, high, high. Up, up. [ shouting] We got somebody down. <br/>Please do not tip the boat! <br/>We got somebody down. <br/>Please do not tip the boat! If this gets water in it, we are screwed. Light it up there. Light it again! Hurry. <br/>Hurry up, hurry up! âª Woo! âª Woo! <br/>Put the torch back. <br/>No need, no need. <br/>They're going to be coming through the same way. <br/>Someone get the last one. [ shouting indistinctly] Someone get the last one. [ shouting indistinctly] Woo! <br/>Probst: Rotu, immunity. Who wants it? You guys are safe for three more days. Unfortunately, one of you guys are going home tomorrow night. We have a day till Tribal Council. Good effort. Head back that way. I'll see you tomorrow. One, two, three, Rotu! <br/>We lost our first immunity One, two, three, Rotu! <br/>We lost our first immunity challenge yesterday, and today we have to go to Tribal Council. So the game has begun. <br/>The party is over. We first got here. We started the fire early. Everybody got to work. But now we lost the challenge and the reality set in. Somebody has to go. <br/>My strategy is to keep as strong as, as strong as possible. <br/>The impression the tribe gave me was that I needed to be voted off to keep the tribe strong. I'm not weak. I know I'm not 25. I'm twice that. I know I can't keep up with you in a foot race, but I can be steady, I can endure, you know. I said is it because I'm a woman or I'm overweight, is it because they think me a mama figure-- all that was going through my mind. <br/>A lot of times the person that looks strongest right out of the chute. <br/>We don't know what's going to happen, is all I'm saying. <br/>That's called life. <br/>I'm glad you told me your strategy, but I don't want to talk about it right now. We're going to go tonight and nobody is to convince me to vote any way because I'm going to vote the way I want to vote. That's the way it is. I guess Peter got on our nerves this morning a little bit because he came up and called us all over and wanted to talk about what the strategy of the game was and how he was going to do it. <br/>I'm not this magical mystical person, all right? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I think if you want to get the truth of the situation, you just can look in someone's eyes. That's not just like, that's not like, "Ooh!," you know. I would have to say tonight that I'm going to vote for Peter. He's just got this strange smirk on his face, always looks like he's up to something. He's just strange. <br/>I know you don't have an alliance. I know I don't have an alliance. <br/>I mean, an alliance right now means absolutely nothing. <br/>I did think about who I possibly may want to vote out, and I was thinking the whole time maybe Sarah. Just today feels too good to be in the water and not, like, doing stuff, you know? <br/>When you look at Sarah and you go, other than having two floating devices that can help us out there, what value is she to the group, other than looking cute? It's very uncomfortable for all of us because we're all one family. It's not chauvinistic, but the more males you have in a camp, the better I think you can survive. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Good luck. <br/>Good luck, Peter. <br/>Thanks, bud. <br/>There's three people that I might choose to vote on: Patricia, if you look at physical strength, she is the weakest person, maybe, just because she's old; Sarah, I think she knows she can maybe use her body with the men, the guys of the tribe; and Peter because of what happened this morning. But right now I have no clue who I'm going to vote for. <br/>Eventually every one us is going but the winner. And who knows who that will be? <br/>Probst: Behind each of you And who knows who that will be? <br/>Probst: Behind each of you guys is a tribal torch. Why don't you go ahead and find your torch and approach the flame? Go ahead and put it back in its slot. We do this because fire does represent life at Tribal Council. As long as you have fire, you have life in this game. When your fire is gone, so are you. It's that simple. Now, all over the Marquesas there are ancient dwellings like this one, thousands of years things have taken place, everything from sacrifices to other rituals. Tribal Council is certainly a ritual. The vote, definitely a sacrifice. Because this is where you're held accountable for your actions on the island. Sometimes those actions are going to help you; sometimes they're going to hurt you. That's what the vote is all about. That's what we're going to find out tonight. But before we get to the first vote, let's talk about the first few days. Gina, what's it like having to source your own food, your own water and your own fire? Is it rewarding at the end of the day to say, "We created all of this?" Yeah, it's very rewarding to do that. We're not given rice. We're not given water. We're not given fire. We won't be given any of those and we have to get it and we've got it. And that... that's awesome. <br/>Probst: Pete, did a leader emerge yet, a clear leader, or is it still a tribe? <br/>Yeah, somebody did step up, and I value the fact that Hunter did step up because I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. He has been optimistic. He has been open, asking each and every one of us what we suggest, and I really value and respect that. <br/>Probst: Peter, feel like you fit in with this group? <br/>Actually, I never felt comfortable. Once I got on land, just didn't feel quite right to me, and I was very surprised. I thought it was going to be a piece of cake for me. <br/>Probst: Sarah, do you think you have a role yet to find? <br/>Kind of everything, we're all just sticking together, doing what needs to be done. We're all come together like that, but I mean, there are some of us that are definitely better at things than others, but I'm just kind of jumping in. <br/>Probst: Okay. Well, somebody always has the distinction of being the first person voted out of the tribe. It's time to find out who that person is. Here's how it's going to work. One by one, you guys are going to make your way along the rock path up to the voting confessional. You'll write down the name of the person you're voting out in clear letters, hold it up, state the reason why you're voting for that person. Okay, it's time to vote. Peter, you're first. <br/>Tricia, you deserve to stay. Peter, you're first. <br/>Tricia, you deserve to stay. <br/>This person is a very nice person, but he did a couple things today that really kind of threw me off. So my vote is for Peter. <br/>Sarah, I love you like a play So my vote is for Peter. <br/>Sarah, I love you like a play cousin. I just don't think you was doing your... your end of the bargain. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote... Peter. Sarah. Patricia. Sarah. Peter. That's two votes Peter; two votes Sarah; one vote Patricia. Peter. Three votes Peter. First person voted out of the tribe: Peter. No need to read the last vote. We'll leave that a mystery. Peter, you need to bring me your torch. Peter, the tribe has spoken. <br/>Go get them. <br/>Probst: Time for you to go. You survived your first vote. <br/>Probst: Time for you to go. You survived your first vote. Now go back and build your world. It's only been three days. Anything can happen. Head back to camp. I'll see you tomorrow. Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:At Maraamu... Here's the plan: Go gather some coconuts. <br/>Probst: ...Patricia takes charge. <br/>This is the tool tree. We're going to leave the machetes here. <br/>She's doing too much talking. <br/>Probst: At Rotu, a hungry tribe competes for the kill. [ whistles] But it's Kathy that finds food. <br/>Get out here. I'm serious! <br/>Sometimes I take myself a little too seriously. I wish I had heeded my wife's advice of just come to this island and have fun. And truly, the other seven contestants, I love them dearly and I'll have fond memories of this adventure.
