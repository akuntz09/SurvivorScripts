<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor:after eight days, the yellow tribe Foa  Foa, had been to the first three Tribal Councils. <br/>I just want to survive to another day. I'm tired. I'm hungry. <br/>Probst: Tensions were high. Nerves were frayed, and the only person who wasn't miserable was Russell. <br/>When people fight I love that. Now, I try to start the fight. <br/>Probst: He now has the hidden immunity idol...  Boo-yah. <br/>Probst: And a diabolical plan. <br/>They can be my little puppets. When I'm finished with them, just throw them in the trash. <br/>Probst: Over at Galu, Shambo had problems fitting in with the rest of her  tribe. <br/>Galu is like they're in high school. The young people want to lay on the beach and gossip. <br/>Probst: She broke their fishing gear. <br/>It's in the swamp. There's nothing I can do. <br/>Probst: And lost one of their chickens. <br/>Shambo is a complete Gilligan who messes just things up all the time. <br/>Probst: Shambo's best friends are on Foa Foa who she bonded with when she  visited their camp. <br/>There was a huge appreciation for Shambo. <br/>Probst: One, two, three, four, five. Foa Foa wins their first immunity challenge! When Galu finally lost an immunity challenge, Russell immunity challenge,  Russell wanted to take out Monica. wanted to take out Monica. But most of the others wanted But most of the others wanted Yasmin to go home. Yasmin to go home. <br/>She does the least out of everyone here. <br/>Probst: At Tribal Council, Russell reluctantly sided with the majority. <br/>I'm sorry. <br/>Probst: Yasmin was gone. And by voting for Monica, Shambo further alienated herself from her tribe. 15 are left. 15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>Everybody go left behind me. And then we'll be in front of the fire in a minute. Well, we just got back from our first Tribal Council, and Yasmin got voted  out. I didn't expect it, not by a long shot. <br/>Do we have any flame there, Shambo? <br/>I haven't gotten to the pot yet. I'm doing that right now, darling. We do. <br/>Okay, perfect. <br/>Let me get this pot out of the way so nobody gets hurt on it. I'm a little disparaged about the fact that every single person on our team  was in alignment, with the exception of myself. I'm absolutely exhausted and hopefully I'll get some good sleep tonight and  pick up the sleep tonight and pick up the pieces tomorrow. pieces tomorrow. So it's like... Whereas we can just sit here and just chill and not do  anything about it. <br/>So Tribal was pretty crazy. Now in retrospect I realize that Shambo is the only person here who voted  against me, so that kind of hangs over my head a little bit, and so I  definitely want to continue and take Sham off. take Sham off. She's my next choice. She's my next choice. She's my next choice. [theme song playing] [theme song playing] [theme song playing]  This ocean is a real bitch. When, you know, you try to go out there, it hits with you massive tides and  waves that suck you and pull you and send you all over the place. I've never seen an object, inanimate, or animate, that was as angry and  fickle as this as angry and fickle as this ocean. ocean. <br/>The ocean is not playing around right now. <br/>Oh, my God. Like, is there a hurricane out there? <br/>It's day 12, and we finally came off a win. We're still excited. The sun's shining. The ocean's been crazy. <br/>What if our flag washed away. <br/>But seems like maybe it's a bright day for Foa Foa. <br/>Tree mail. <br/>Tree mail. <br/>You guys ready? <br/>Ready. <br/>"The ocean's deep provide many a treat. Some pay a fortune for what you will eat. If you keep it all down inside your tummy, you just may win something  yummy."  No! <br/>Oh, no, it's a food challenge. <br/>Oh, no! We're going to have to eat gross, like, stuff from the ocean. <br/>Oh, my God! <br/>What do you mean gross stuff, like fish? <br/>Just do it. <br/>No! <br/>It's gonna be nasty stuff. <br/>No it will be like Samoan rat. <br/>The trick is, you can't throw it up. You have to keep it down. You cannot puke. <br/>I know. <br/>I'm actually really excited about our reward challenge. I'm a pretty experimental eater. I'll try everything once. So hopefully this comes to my advantage and hopefully I am one of the  stronger people on one of the stronger people on my tribe today. my tribe today. <br/>Why? <br/>You said it was going to be a hard time for you, didn't you? <br/>No, I said I'd eat it. <br/>No, I said I'd eat it. I'd just be grossed out. I'd just be grossed out. <br/>I was about to say, "You done with this? You trying to put her on some kind of chopping block? You want me to just watch her, just watch her individual eating challenge? <br/>Right. I know, she's always spreading little...  Yeah, she's trying to spread little seeds to grow in people's heads. She should just shut up about it. Liz could be dangerous for me if she's able to manipulate other to go her way  instead of my way. So as soon as I see somebody playing that mind game on other people, they're  a huge threat because that's what this game is all about is mind games, and  I've gotta be the only mind I've gotta be the only mind game player here. game player here. game player here. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. Foa Foa, getting your first look at the new Galu tribe. Yasmin voted out at the last Tribal Council. Guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yup. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Probst: If there is one thing I am sure of, it is this-- you are all hungry. <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: The good news is, today you will eat. I'll spin the wheel. One member of each tribe will roll a ball. The ball will land on different ingredients. I will then blend those ingredients to make a Samoa smoothie. And you will then gulp it down. Each time you get it down, you score a point for your tribe. It's not a race. If you get it down, you score a point. First tribe to five wins reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Probst: If you can get the bad stuff down you get the good stuff. <br/>Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Survivorbarbecue. <br/>Probst: Survivorbarbecue. All you have to do is get the smoothie down. <br/>Drink it. I don't care what it tastes like. <br/>Probst: In addition, the winning tribe will send one of its members over to  the losing tribe for a little spy expedition, which means that person will  miss out on the reward. Worth playing for? <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: All right, Galu, you're sitting out three people this challenge. Keep in mind, you cannot sit out the same people in back-to-back challenges. Who's it going to be Russell? <br/>It's going to be Kelly, Laura, and John. <br/>Probst: Kelly, Laura, John, take a spot on the bench. Everybody else take a spot on your benches, and we will get your benches, and  we will get started. started. All right, first two. Shambo for Galu taking on Shambo for Galu taking on Jaison. Jaison.

Jeff's choice means I get to add whatever I'd like. And the flies seem to really like the octopus. like the octopus. <br/>All right! <br/>All right! <br/>Probst: Let's see what else we can have. How about a sea snail or two. <br/>Really? <br/>Probst: And I'm gonna  Probst: And I'm gonna give you a little noni juice. give you a little noni juice. <br/>You got this, Jaison, no worries. <br/>Think of the steaks. <br/>Probst: Add a little garnish, fresh seaweed. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: Cheers. <br/>Cheers. <br/>Get it, Sham. <br/>Don't chew, just swallow. <br/>Come on, Jaison. <br/>Probst: Shambo not messing around at all. <br/>Okay, take it downtown. <br/>You got it, girl. <br/>Yeah, that's the stuff. <br/>Yeah, that's the stuff. <br/>Good job, Jaison. <br/>Good job, Jaison.

You got it, you got it. <br/>Probst: It's his last gulp. <br/>It's coming up! <br/>Stay with it, Jaison, you got it. <br/>Probst: And he keeps it down. Jaison scores for Foa Foa. We are tied one-one. Next two. We have Russell taking on Russell. <br/>The battle of the Russells! <br/>Probst: Wow, you landed on the same one. It's a jellyfish special. Let me just get in here and get some good helping of jellyfish. <br/>All right! <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Yummy! <br/>Probst: I think I'm going to go milk. <br/>Milk. Oh, my God! Oh, milk! <br/>I don't even drink milk by itself. <br/>Probst: Well, you're going to really enjoy this. Bon appÃ    tit, gentlemen. Bottoms up. <br/>Cheers, fellows. <br/>Slow and steady, Russell. <br/>Probst: Great way to start day 12 on Survivor: Samoa. <br/>Nasty. [Russell groans] [Galu cheers]  That's it. <br/>Probst: Russell says no problem. <br/>All right, Russell, take your time, baby, take your time. <br/>Probst: Oh, Russell-- other Russell spitting it up. <br/>Come on, Russ! Think about the steak. <br/>Think about the steaks, brother. Think about those steak and and sausages. <br/>Steaks for dinner. Get it, get it, get it, get it! <br/>Probst: Not messing around now; that's what you call a survivor right there. [Foa Foa cheering] Nice job. [applause] After two rounds, we are tied, 2-2. Very impressive. <br/>Good job! <br/>Probst: Next round. Brett for Galu taking on Mick for Foa Foa. Giant clam with sea cucumber. A little sea cucumber.

Take a seat. <br/>All right! <br/>Awesome! <br/>Don't puke, baby. <br/>Probst: Brett's getting every last drop. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Licking the glass. He's a freak. <br/>I think that's about good. <br/>Probst: Nice job. We're tied 3-3. Next two. It's Monica for Galu and Liz for Foa Foa. Both balls land on sea urchin. Since both balls landed on it, I think we'll just give the full deal. <br/>There's no worries. <br/>Yeah, you got it, Liz. It's a protein shake. [blender whirring]  Probst: Wow, it's like a chocolate shake. [Monica laughs]  Probst: A little sea noodle for a garnish. Cheers. <br/>All right, Liz, you got it. <br/>Good job, Liz, you can do it. <br/>Probst: Monica takes that sea noodle out. Don't lose any of that. Liz plugging her nose. <br/>All right, Liz, you got it. <br/>Probst: Monica does not waste anything time. She's just trying to throw this down. <br/>You're doing good, Liz, yeah. <br/>Probst: Liz trying to avoid that rancid smell. Monica shoving the sea noodle down. That is impressive. The girl can eat. <br/>Slow and steady, Liz. <br/>Probst: Monica, show me that empty mouth. Nice job. Monica scores for Galu. [cheers and applause ]  Probst: Liz very close for Foa Foa. <br/>Good job, girl. <br/>Probst: Nice job, Liz. We are still tied, 4-4. Ashley for Foa Foa. Dave for Galu.

I'll give it a little bit of a blend but not a lot. [blender whirring]  You think those are kidneys or livers or what? <br/>I don't really want to know. <br/>Probst: Chunks for Ashley; a few more chunks for Dave. Here we go. Sea slug guts, compliments of the house. [glasses clink]  You got this Ashley, no worries. <br/>Probst: You wanted to be on Survivor. Welcome to the game. <br/>Whoo! [Dave sputtering] [Dave sputtering]  Good job, Ash. <br/>Good job, Ash. <br/>[groaning]: Ugh! [Dave retching, shudders]  Take your time. <br/>Probst: Ashley trying to block out Dave's near-vomit block out Dave's  near-vomit sounds. sounds. Dave gets it down for Galu. [applause] Ashley gotta get this down to force a tie-breaker. <br/>No worries. You got this. <br/>Oh... don't puke. It looks like she already vomited in the glass, and then she's got to drink  the vomit. <br/>Oh, God, there she goes. <br/>Suck it up. [all groaning with disgust]  Probst: Ashley needs to get this down. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: You're going to have to swallow and chug. <br/>[groaning]: Oh! <br/>Can't do it. <br/>Aw...  Probst: Ashley can't finish for Foa Foa. Galu wins reward! [Galu cheering]  Yeah! [cheering and laughter]  I'm going to puke again. Sorry, guys. <br/>It's all right. <br/>Oh. <br/>God. <br/>Probst: Galu, congratulations. Nice job. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Yay! <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: First order of business-- Russell, you're sending one person from  your tribe over to Foa Foa's camp. They will stay with them until the next immunity challenge. So whoever you choose is going to miss out on this reward. <br/>I'm going to send my girl Shambo again. <br/>Excuse me? <br/>We need more info, babe. <br/>I don't think that's very fair since I've already been. <br/>I mean, what do you... What do you want me to do? <br/>Can you spread the love for me? <br/>Probst: Russell has made his decision. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: All right, Shambo. This is for you to open in private. Join Foa Foa on their bench. <br/>Hi, kids. <br/>Had to pay for that chicken. <br/>Probst: Galu, your reward. Come get it. Head back to camp. Have a great afternoon. <br/>Yay! <br/>I'm so bummed out. I'm pissed. Having Russell say that I had to come over to Foa Foa. It's not coming to Foa Foa. It's missing out on the protein that my body so badly needs right now. I feel like I got hit by a train I feel like I got hit by a train today. today. <br/>I don't even care about reward. <br/>Yeah. <br/>You guys are pissed. Imagine how I feel. <br/>We're happy to have you, but I totally understand how you feel. <br/>I'm happy to be here with you guys. You guys are all sweethearts. There's no hidden agenda. What you see is what you get. <br/>Sorry we don't have steaks for you. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>It's all good, man. I don't need a damn steak. I'll-I'll take a group hug. <br/>Group hug? We can do that for you. <br/>I'll take a group hug. <br/>That you can get. <br/>Get in here. <br/>Get a Shambo. <br/>I'm down with that. I love these guys, but I wanted that rib eye. I wanted that steak. I need that steak. I need that protein. <br/>I'm so disappointed in myself. <br/>You know, I was surprised. I thought Ashley would be just fine in today's challenge, but she's the one  that lost it for us. Like, come on. It's just one of those things. You got to suck it up. <br/>I've never been so close to passing out in my entire life. <br/>It's nothing that's going to hurt you. It just tastes bad. I feel like sometimes she's not carrying her weight. <br/>I don't think I would have finished. <br/>I'm an easy target, though. <br/>Well, don't worry about it, because I'm... You are a rock star. You had, like, this much left. I almost threw up. <br/>I'm so happy you're out here with me. <br/>I'm so happy you're out here, too. <br/>You have no idea. I'm very disappointed in myself. I tried, but my body, like, literally couldn't take it. I threw up immediately. Like, I could not get it down. I put all the blame on myself. It sucks. I tried. I mean...  You did so... You know what? You did so good. I'm really proud of you. You stepped it up, for sure. <br/>I mean, honestly, you're helping me get through it. <br/>Oh. After the challenge, Ashley felt horrible, but... You know, she felt like it  was her fault, but you know what? We're kind of... kind of like sisters, so we've kind of been able to talk  each other through that and encourage each other, so, you know, I just wanted  to make her feel better about it. I hope I can pick you up and...  Yeah...  You know that you're strong. And you've done well. You've done really, really well. I'm really proud of you. I'm really proud of you. [birds screeching] [birds screeching]  Get that fire going. Get some water. <br/>Quick order of business, crew. If people were to ask me, well, it really sucked that I sent Shambo over to  the tribe so she couldn't partake in the feast... Well, it really sucked when  she lost our chicken. <br/>I agree. <br/>All right? <br/>Yeah, right. <br/>So, this should clean her slate, but she had to suffer some consequences for  losing a food source. So, let's eat! So, let's eat! [whooping] [whooping]  So we come back from the reward challenge. We got all this food. Everybody's ready, and it's, like, let's eat. <br/>Catch! <br/>But Chief jumps in and starts messing up the fire, getting... messing up the  fire, getting... doing a bum job of it. doing a bum job of it. <br/>Any dry husks anywhere? <br/>No, all of this husk is wet. I just want to eat the thing. I'm damn near getting tempted to eat it raw...  Ah. <br/>...'cause this is bogus. <br/>You need three things for fire. You need the spark, you need air, and you need fuel...  Dave, you do a lot of talking, but not a lot of action. <br/>Is that right? <br/>Yeah, you do, man. Just do it. <br/>It's funny, 'cause I was the one who started the fire first. <br/>Well, come on. Help us, dude. <br/>Okay. No, no... [muttering] I don't want to do that, because you'll just be, like,  "All right, let me keep playing with it."  I'm not in the mood for suggestions. I'm in the mood for help. After we get this started...  All you got to do is ask, man. All you got to do is ask. <br/>If anyone thinks they can start the fire, jump in, don't hold back. hold back. <br/>No. <br/>No. <br/>No, I didn't ask... Was I asked for help? <br/>Well, if you can start it, start it, you know. <br/>I got to hear it from the chief. the chief. <br/>No, you don't. <br/>No, you don't. You're a grown ass man. <br/>Man, I'm not even trying to be arrogant. It's just that I sometimes patronize people without thinking about it, but  I'm afraid that I'm going to shoot myself in the foot without knowing what's  happening. Hey, Chief, I'm sorry about being a jerk, dude. <br/>Don't worry about it. <br/>All right. Shake? <br/>It's all good, man. <br/>It's all good, man. <br/>All right. <br/>All right. <br/>I'd love to. <br/>All right, good. <br/>Oh. <br/>Build that thing up, Dave. Come on. <br/>Ow! Whooey, that's hot. Get down. <br/>Good job, guys! <br/>Dave's the man! <br/>Dave did it. <br/>Dave, that's awesome! <br/>Apparently, nobody here knows how to make fire but me, which to me is, like,  really? <br/>All right, so what are we doing? What are we doing? What are we doing? <br/>But I'm trying to downplay my awesomeness, 'cause it speaks for itself. Actions speak louder than words, so I don't need to say anything. <br/>Oh, my gosh, that looks so good. <br/>Oh, my God. [laughter] [whooping]  You know, hey, if I'm the only guy here that can make only guy here that can  make fire, makes me pretty valuable. fire, makes me pretty valuable. <br/>They are in trouble. I could take the whole... After I finish this, I could After I finish this, I  could take the whole team by myself. take the whole team by myself. [birds singing]  Hey, you guys, I'm going to share the clues with you to the hidden immunity  idol. <br/>Nice. <br/>'Cause you're more of a damn tribe to me than my tribe is. [laughter] The third clue is, "Turn your gaze downward, scour the earth  and take heed. Inside the hole of the tree is the idol you need." Which is this tree  right here. <br/>By the fire. Shambo-- she's still looking for Shambo-- she's still looking for the immunity  idol. the immunity idol. <br/>But she will never find it. [Russell laughs] It's in my pocket. So that's funny. <br/>Jaison, do you have the  Jaison, do you have the hidden immunity idol? hidden immunity idol? <br/>No, I don't have it. Would I tell you if I had it? <br/>I hope so. <br/>I know damn well Ben got kicked out with that freaking idol, idiot. <br/>Oh, I agree. <br/>I know he did. <br/>But he didn't play it, so...  I know. <br/>The immunity idol was never played, even if Ben had it. I mean, I know somebody has it, and I have a feeling, if it wasn't Ben, it's  Russell, and I have a feeling it's probably have a feeling it's probably  Russell. Russell. <br/>Yeah, I've been in that tree a lot, but not all the way up in it. Where is it? <br/>You don't have to go all the way up in it. She didn't stand up in it. I'm telling you. You are lying to me. <br/>Why is this so much of a concern for you? <br/>Because I want...  Why are you so worried about this? <br/>Because I feel like you should be honest. <br/>You're freaking me out right now, 'cause I'm telling you the truth, and  you're telling me I'm not honest. <br/>Well...  You want to be the one who goes next? You're throwing all kind of stupid stuff around. Liz, she gets it. She knows what's going on. But why in the world would you threaten me? That's like slapping me in the face. You don't think I'm going to get back at you? Girl, you're walking on that thin ice. <br/>Ben... Ben told me...  I'm going to tell you that right now. Let me tell you. You're walking on thin ice, You're walking on thin ice, period. period. <br/>Oh, God. There's been a lot of rain tonight, like torrential downpour, and it's  freezing. Now all our blankets are wet. I'm actually regretting the decision to choose blankets instead of the tarp  right now. This is the hardest night yet. This is the hardest night yet. It's bad. It's bad. It's bad. [bird singing] [bird singing]  Come on, boys. Right there. [grunts] Tree mail, baby. [indistinct chatter]  Oh. <br/>Oh. Tree mail. Tree mail. <br/>"Some hold on for their lives while others will attack. So who gets the glory, and who gets the sack? Obviously, in this challenge, you'll have to kick some butts. Not worried about going home tonight? tonight? Then you must be plain nuts." Then you must be plain nuts."  For the past 24 hours, I haven't really thought about the game. I've just been trying to focus on, uh, staying dry, but, you know, today is a  huge challenge. It's the first immunity challenge after we lost the last immunity challenge,  so we really want to reclaim this and keep up our advantage. So I'm hoping people will forget about their discomfort forget about their  discomfort and just hit it hard today. and just hit it hard today. and just hit it hard today. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! All right, Shambo, you can return to your tribe, Galu. That doesn't look like a very nice welcome from Galu, Shambo. Other than Erik, nobody even acknowledged you coming back. <br/>It's a game. I wouldn't take it personally. It's raining, and everyone's trying to stay warm. <br/>Probst: All right, you guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yup. <br/>Yup. <br/>Probst: First things first. Foa Foa, I'll take back immunity. <br/>Let's go, guys. We can get this. We can get this. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, one man and one woman from both tribes will each hold  on to a rope connected to a net while members of the other tribe attempt to  shoot coconuts into that net. The more coconuts go into the net, the heavier the net becomes until you can  no longer hold on. The tribe member who holds on to their net the longest wins immunity for  their tribe. Losers go to Tribal Council where somebody will be voted out of this game. Galu, you have three extra members. You're sitting three people out. You cannot sit out the same people in back-to-back challenges. You need to sit out two men and one woman. <br/>All right, I'm going to sit out Dave. <br/>You want out, Sham? <br/>Mm. <br/>Sham wants out. <br/>Sham. <br/>I have to. <br/>And Brett. <br/>Probst: All right, Dave, Brett, Shambo, sitting this one out. Take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize. minute to strategize. We'll get started. We'll get started. All right. Holding the ropes for Foa Foa, it is Liz and Russell. For Galu, it's Russell and Laura. Here we go. For immunity. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Let's go, Galu! <br/>Probst: The faster you get coconuts in the basket, the heavier they get. <br/>Come on down, Galu! You guys got it! <br/>Probst: Kelly, right off the bat, scores for Galu. <br/>Nice! <br/>Probst: John scores for Galu. <br/>Good job, John! <br/>Probst: Jaison is short. Mick way short. John with another toss on Russell. [indistinct shouting]  Probst: And it connects. <br/>John Boy! <br/>Good job, Johnny! <br/>Probst: Natalie's short. Jaison's short. Foa Foa has yet to get one coconut in. John going for two, and John connects again for Galu. <br/>Yeah! [indistinct chatter]  Probst: Jaison with the first hit for Foa Foa. Mick way short again. Galu is on fire. They can't miss. <br/>Whoa! <br/>Probst: Foa Foa needs to pick it up. <br/>Oh, geez. <br/>Probst: Rain really coming down now. down now. [loud, rumbling thunder] [loud, rumbling thunder]  Probst: Erik tosses a three, and it lands on Liz's. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: She does not like it. <br/>Good job! <br/>Probst: Kelly scores for Galu. Erik scores for Galu. John scores for Galu. Russell holding a lot of weight in that net for Foa Foa. Foa Foa, you need to double-time it. Ashley hasn't made a single shot yet. Jaison piling on Russell now. <br/>Doing good, Russ! Hold on, baby! <br/>Probst: Natalie connects. <br/>Knock 'em dead, John. <br/>Probst: John with another toss and another hit. Russell struggling to hang on. [grunting]  Probst: This might do it from Erik. Nope. Russell's still fighting. [Russell breathes loudly]  Probst: John trying to put Russell out of it. He connects. Russell digging deep. [Russell grunts] Another one from Erik. That might do it, and it does. Russell's out of the challenge. [overlapping shouting]  Probst: Liz, the last remaining hope for Foa Foa. <br/>Come on, Liz! <br/>Probst: Liz going to have to dig deep and outlast Russell and Laura. <br/>Let's go, Galu. We've got it, guys. <br/>Probst: Mick puts one in on Russell. Erik just misses. <br/>Oh! <br/>Good job, Liz! <br/>Probst: Liz doing a great job keeping Foa Foa in this. Jaison connects! Russell now struggling for Galu. <br/>It's a wrap. <br/>Probst: Erik calling it. <br/>It's a wrap. <br/>Probst: Is this enough? <br/>Come on, Liz! <br/>Probst: Liz giving everything she has. Is this enough from John? Liz struggling to hang on. <br/>Russell, hang out, Russell. Hang out. <br/>Good job, Liz. <br/>Good job, Liz. Good job, Liz! Good job, Liz! <br/>Probst: John puts another one in. <br/>Good job, G. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Liz out of the challenge! Galu wins immunity! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah! <br/>Hell, yeah! Good job, boy. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thank you. [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter]  Probst: Galu, congratulations. Once again, immunity is yours. <br/>Yes. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: No Tribal Council tonight. Nobody else going home from Galu. Russell, Liz, Jaison, Ashley, Mick, Natalie, after 14 days, one of you will  be voted out at tonight's Tribal Council. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal. I will see you at Tribal. I will see you at Tribal. [rolling thunder] [rolling thunder] [rolling thunder] [rolling thunder]  [rolling thunder]  Today is the first day I'm convinced that we might be at a real serious  disadvantage. You know, it just doesn't... As a tribe, it doesn't look good anymore. <br/>Oh, I'm sorry. <br/>It's okay. <br/>I'm sorry, sweetie. <br/>It's okay. <br/>Our shelter's got rain in it. None of us slept last night. We're all cold. We're all tired. Our hands and feet look like crap. This is absolute misery. I have never in my life been this cold, had my hands this destroyed, and my  feet look so miserable in my life. There's nothing I want to do more right now than to get out of here. of here. [loud, rumbling thunderclaps] [loud, rumbling thunderclaps] [loud, rumbling  thunderclaps]  No. <br/>No. <br/>No. <br/>I know I don't want to go. <br/>I know I don't want to go. <br/>Normally, before Tribal Council, we all get to run around and scramble,  trying to figure out strategy, but today... I mean, we're all cooped up in a shelter  right now. We... I can't do much about it without other people hearing. It's either we all just vote for whoever we think, and everyone just pack  your bags, or we talk about it and figure it out so the person knows who's  out so the person knows who's going home. going home. <br/>It will be an interesting Tribal. I have no idea what everyone else is going to do. I'm going to vote for Liz. I haven't really had a trust with her since day one. I always thought there was something weird going on with something weird  going on with her, so I just don't trust her. her, so I just don't trust her. <br/>I think Ashley should go. She, to me, is the physical weakest link. I just don't think she pulled her weight in the challenges. <br/>We got to send somebody home tonight. Because the guys are pretty tight-- possibly Liz, possibly, uh, Ashley, um,  or Natalie. I'll play it by ear. <br/>We're all stuck in the shelter, confined in a little ball, so I don't know  what everybody's decision is going to be, but I think it's going to be one of  us girls, for sure. <br/>I have absolutely no idea what's going to go down with this vote. My mentality right now is just to go into Tribal Council and to go into  Tribal Council and see what happens. see what happens. <br/>It bums me out that I had to stop my strategy because of the rain. That's not playing the game like I would regularly play it. [thunder crashing] Liz asked me if I had the immunity idol, and she just  keeps telling me that she don't trust me. You know, when you come at me like that, and you tell me you don't trust me,  it puts a target on your back. But Liz is stronger than Ashley. So I-I don't really know which So I-I don't really know which way I'm going  to go tonight. way I'm going to go tonight. <br/>Probst: Jaison, finish this sentence for me. "Until Survivor,the toughest thing I'd ever gone through was..."  If I had to make a comparison, there was, uh, you know, when I was playing on  the U.S.A. National team...  Probst: In what sport? <br/>Uh, in water polo. We had this Yugoslavian coach who believed that our body needed to be in  crisis at all times, so we're jumping in the pool and wrestling with another  guy, then jumping out and doing circuits of just beating up on each other,  for eight, nine hours a day, seven days a week. So, I came in here thinking that this wasn't going to be that big a deal  because I had done a lot of training and done a lot of things I thought were  hard, but this is by far the hardest thing I've ever done. <br/>Probst: Ashley, I'm guessing coming to Tribal was almost welcome, simply  because there is a warm fire here and cover from the rain. <br/>Yeah, that's true, because we're all so cold. Our clothes are drenched. I mean, it sucks sending someone home, but at the same time, hey, at least  there's going to be a fire tonight. <br/>And the fact that we're also, like, stuck under this little shelter and it's  pouring rain. I mean, it's pretty tough to scramble, you know, when we're all sitting there  watching each other. You can only be so subtle. What, are you gonna pull somebody out in the rain? They'd be like, "Hell, no, I'm not going with you. It's freezing out there. Are you mad? You're going home, man, that's it."  Probst: Natalie, that's got to be a little uncomfortable, knowing that maybe  they decided, "You know what? The girl in the yellow dress-- I guess I'm gonna vote for her."  That's true. There was no way to try and strategize. Literally we're, like, purple. Before, it was always a scramble, so I think the weather had a lot to do with  it today. <br/>Probst: Russell, does the criteria for voting begin to change when you look  at what you've been through and what you might have to go through? Does suddenly competition at challenges give way to: who do I really like  being around or who can I trust? <br/>Yeah, I think it does. We are down to five people now, and I think to me, it depends on who you can  trust. That's like gold in this game. But the fact of the matter is: I really trust the people around me right now. <br/>Probst: So that's the problem. <br/>And that's the problem. Right. <br/>Probst: Ashley, Russell talks about trusting everybody at this point. Who do you trust in this tribe? <br/>I trust everyone to a certain extent, but I think my biggest trust lies in  Natalie and Russell. <br/>Probst: What is it about Russell you trust? <br/>From the get-go, he's kind of pulled me under his wing a little bit. I don't know, I just feel like I can talk to him. So, from the get-go, that's why we have had-- kind of had a different  connection. <br/>Probst: Liz, who do you trust? <br/>I trust pretty much everyone here. I think in going through three Tribal Councils and enduring all the losses  that we've had to endure, it's brought us much more closer together than I  ever would have anticipated and I am surprised that I would place so much  trust in these guys, but I do. <br/>Probst: So you'd be shocked if it was you tonight? <br/>I would be surprised, but it's my gut that would tell me, and, you know,  that's not an issue about trust. <br/>Probst: Mick, how will this tribe be better when they go back to camp tonight? <br/>In the long haul, maybe we'll be a little more organized. Maybe we'll be a little bit stronger at challenges. You know, eventually I think that will strengthen us. <br/>Probst: Jaison, you agree with that? <br/>I think so. I mean, depending on who leaves, we could be a stronger team physically. We could end up being a weaker team because somebody is hurt that their  person went and they didn't think they were supposed to. <br/>Probst: Russell, do you like the feeling as we get ready to vote? It's so up in the air. It's a wild card. Who knows what everybody else is going to do? <br/>Yeah, it doesn't make sense and that's not how you play the game, but with  this group, I think we're just too tight, so I don't really think it's up in  the air. <br/>Probst: We'll find out if you're right. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to vote. to vote. Mick, you're up. Mick, you're up. <br/>I trust you the least out of  I trust you the least out of everyone. everyone. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote-- Ashley. First vote-- Ashley. Liz. Ashley. Two votes-- Ashley, one vote-- Liz. Ashley. That's three votes-- Ashley, one vote-- Liz. Fifth person voted out of Survivor: Samoa--Ashley. That's four, that's enough. That's four, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. Ashley, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go. Time for you to go. <br/>Kick some butt, you guys. <br/>Kick some butt, you guys. <br/>Probst: Well, you're now down to five members. The question is: can you dig deep enough to do what needs to be done to turn  this game around? Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor. The storms continue to batter both tribes. <br/>The elements out here-- like, it's going to break you down. [Jaison laughs, thunder cracks]  Probst: And another castaway goes down. Hold up, hold up, hold up. Everybody, hold up. Medical! Medical! Hold where you are. Hold where you are. <br/>Survivorwas the hardest thing I've ever done in my entire life, but it was  the best experience. I have learned so much about myself. I am such a high-maintenance girl at home. I never thought in a million years that I would be able to go through the  things that I've gone through here. I wish that my tribe would beat Galu and take some wins, and hopefully one of  them can win hopefully one of them can win the million dollars.
