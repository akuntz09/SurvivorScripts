<br/>JEFF Probst: Previously on Survivor:Fearing Amber was out  of the game, Rob felt lost. <br/>I hope Amber is still here. Maybe Lex came through for me. <br/>Probst: But when the tribes arrived at the reward  challenge, Rob got a pleasant surprise. Jerri voted out at the last Tribal Council. The challenge came down to a test of sheer strength. Rupert wins reward! Rupert picked Jenna and Amber to join him on an overnight spa  reward...  Oh, my God! <br/>Probst: ... where they were treated to some welcomed  creature comforts. <br/>I'm going to go back there Superman. [chuckling]  Probst: The next morning, the tribes arrived at what  appeared to be a challenge. [all cheering] It is the merge color! You will live your remaining days right here on Saboga Beach. Their first order of business was naming the tribe. <br/>How about Chaboga Mogo? <br/>ALL: Chaboga Mogo, Chaboga Mogo! <br/>Probst: When Rob and Amber finally had a moment to  reunite, they had one thing on their minds. <br/>We need to get rid of Lex. <br/>I'm here because of him. <br/>Don't go soft on me. We're playing for a million bucks over here. <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge, two individual  immunities were up for grabs:  Wow. <br/>Probst: ...one for men, one for women. For the women, it came down to Amber and Kathy. Kathy wins immunity! And for the men, despite Lex's early lead... Boston Rob comes  from behind, wins immunity! Nice effort. Before Tribal Council, even though Lex and Kathy had saved  Amber, Rob told them the deal was off. <br/>The word I gave you was that if I can take care of you, I  will. I'm sorry, I cannot. <br/>LEX: I had my game all worked out. And if, and if I had gotten rid of Amber, I would have come in  here with my numbers advantage. In fact, I've... I completely... my own game. <br/>Right. <br/>LEX: It's about getting a knife in the back. <br/>Probst: In order to save Lex, Kathy offered him her  immunity. <br/>I don't want it! <br/>Probst: But at Tribal Council, Kathy had a change of  heart. <br/>Thought about it. I'm keeping it. <br/>Probst: A dumbfounded Lex was next to go. First member of our jury, Lex. The tribe has spoken. Eight all-stars are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Captioning sponsored by CBS PARAMOUNT NETWORK TELEVISION [theme  song playing] [thunder rolling]  Hey, you guys...  Oh, my God. <br/>Our fire has a swimming pool! <br/>Oh, my God. It's nothing but a huge puddle. <br/>It's gone. <br/>I knew when I saw the puddle forming that the fire was  going to be washed away. <br/>Well, not only did Tribal suck, 'cause it always sucks,  but it poured on us the entire time. We're freezing cold. And especially for me-- I had to suffer two votes. So, I'm just happy to still be here. <br/>Well, I'm glad... I'm glad that's over. Now, where's Kathy? Is she okay? Is she...? <br/>Why? She take a walk? <br/>Uh, she's not over there. <br/>What's done is done. <br/>She's bumming. <br/>I was going to give my immunity away tonight at Tribal,  but I just couldn't do it. I wanted to, but I couldn't do it. [thunder crashing] It's really hard being on the losing side of  life here. I think Boston Rob has a soul, but, um, he has this temper, and  he was really hurtful today. And, uh, Amber's playing a tough game. She's lying. She's lying like a rug. So, I voted for the person that just lied to my face several  times. <br/>I think the votes would have come to me if I didn't have  immunity. <br/>Oh, yeah. <br/>Because you were... you're a target just like Lex was. <br/>Everything went down according to plan. It was kind of a tough vote, to tell you the truth. Lex was a friend, uh, but we are playing a game. He said some pretty personal stuff to me before we went to  Tribal Council. I understand when your back's against the wall, sometimes you  scramble, but I think he was pushing it a little bit too hard. <br/>I said, "Lex, you're telling me that you want to go  to the final four with me, Boston Rob and Tom?" He goes,  "Yeah." His goal was to have us four friends up there making the  money. And he felt that for some reason, you guys had it just by kind  of osmosis. And then all of a sudden, we get over here and we realize we're  on the chopping block. So, that's what caused the anger. And that's normal! It should. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We should be angry if we're on the chopping block. <br/>I never promised Lex an alliance. I never said two words to Kathy. A very important thing did happen today, though. Lex slipped up in his conversation when he was mad, yelling and  screaming, and basically exposed Big Tom, meaning that Big Tom would have  switched sides. Big Tom, you got caught. And your best buddy sold you out, and he didn't even know he did  it. [thunder crashing] [thunder rolling]  You couldn't have had a [thunder rolling]  You couldn't have had a horror movie any worse than what  we had last night. We got soaking wet. We've been waiting for daylight for two days. Now it's daylight and it's blacker than a dungeon. Looks like it's going to rain again. <br/>Day four of no sleep. <br/>We're going to start losing our minds a little bit. <br/>Our fire pit is in a lake, in a little stream. It's freezing cold and soaking wet. Make it through the night, [coughs] but... in hopes that when  the sun came up, it'd be better. When the sun came up, it was still bad; it was worse. <br/>This beach is bad luck. <br/>Yeah, it's like we're trapped. <br/>I'd never seen a place that rained so much in my whole  life, ever. <br/>I woke up this morning feeling vulnerable and scared  and... I thought to myself, "Why am I here?" I'm miserable. <br/>You're so stripped of I'm miserable. <br/>You're so stripped of everything out here, and you're not  yourself. You're surrounded by relative strangers, even though I know  these people, and you're put in such a physically demanding environment that  you have to bond together with them. But this is the final 11 days. We have food, warm beds, family to look forward to. That's what's keeping me going. <br/>Okay, guys, we have tree mail. <br/>Yay. What is it? <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>It is, uh... I know what that is, guys. <br/>It's a thing that you hang from that goes down the line. <br/>Yeah? <br/>Yeah. <br/>All right. "Red team, Green team, Yellow team, Blue. This mixing and matching must be confusing you. Working together to win on your own. Bring the necklaces with you... it's not for reward  alone."  Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Already, it's combined. <br/>That means we have immunity and Tribal Council tonight,  too. <br/>It sounds like combined reward and immunity. I thought the first immunity yesterday was going to last three  days. So I guess it's not. I got an "X" on my back. So, I have to win this immunity. <br/>Probst: What's going on, Rupert? <br/>Hi, Jeff. <br/>Probst: Hi, Jenna. So, today's challenge is a doozy. It is part tribal, part individual. It is part reward and it is part immunity. And it is definitely physically demanding. It is a Survivorobstacle course, one of the toughest we've ever  had. Two parts to the first reward. Letters from home. <br/>Oh...  I saw my name. <br/>Probst: There's one here for everybody, but only four of  you will win them. And four rain parkas. <br/>Aw...  Probst: Four of you will have them, four of you will not. For the immunity winner, they also receive a little more comfort  in the form of a video from home. A chance to really connect with the people who love you back  home, maybe give you what you need to get through these last 11 days. Along with that comes a big old pitcher of hot chocolate. And, to whet your appetite a little bit for this challenge, I  put together a videotape with just a little sampling of everybody's loved  one. We'll go inside, we'll watch it, take part in the challenge. One last thing, Boston Rob, Kathy, I need the immunity back. One of these is no more. Individual immunity up for grabs. Let's go watch some videos. <br/>Probst: Okay, I'm not going to lie. It's a very short tease. Amber, you're first up. This is your sister Nicole, your niece Emma and your parents. [sniffling]  Hi, Amber. Say hi to Amber. Say "We miss you." [laughs] Whoo! Look at the camera. [blowing kisses]  We love you! <br/>Bye-bye! <br/>Probst: Do you have a tight family? <br/>A very tight family. I think they're probably worrying about me, hoping that, you  know, I'm just taking it day by day and getting through. <br/>Probst: Okay. This is Alicia's mom. <br/>Hey, babe. I miss you. I miss you terribly. Keep yourself focused. I love you, babe, and I'll see you real soon. Bye, doll. <br/>God, I didn't need to see that. We talk every day. I know she misses me. A lot. We're best friends. <br/>Probst: All right, Tom. Here is your son Buckie Bo and your wife Sandy. <br/>Hi, buddy. I hope everything is goin' good with you. Everybody's wonderin' how you're doin'. I told 'em you got it under control. <br/>Hello, Big Tom. Here we are in Richfield. It's a beautiful day. I wish you were here. Love you and miss you. Bye-bye. <br/>Hey. Home chick looking pretty good. <br/>She's a hottie. <br/>Probst: Tom, I don't buy that you're not a little  emotional. <br/>It's always nice to see family. Bo's probably my best... well, best friend and, uh... Well, that  woman's been living with me, uh... 25 years. She deserves the final. <br/>Probst: Got a good family. <br/>Pretty good family. <br/>Probst: Heading towards the slightly unusual-- what would  we expect from a relative of Boston Rob? [others laugh] Check out Rob's brother, Mike. <br/>Oh, man. <br/>Hey, Rob, what's up? This is your brother Mike. I'm going to bring it loud. I hope this motivates you. [muttering]: ...to renovate, because you got to bring home the  gold, son! [laughter]  He's doing Don King there. He's the best. I miss him. My brother's always been there for me, my whole family, my whole  life, always. They're first and foremost in my life and they always will be. <br/>Probst: All right, Shii Ann, here are your folks, Lily and  Don. <br/>Hey, Ann. Hurry home, Ann. We miss you. [laughter] Come back home safely. <br/>Oh, Mom! <br/>Rescue me from this crazy family. I wanna go home. [cat meows]  Probst: Does this motivate you for the last 11 days? <br/>It makes me energized, it makes me want to keep going and  it makes me want to win. They're going to be so shocked that I'm as far as I got,  so...  Probst: Kathy, your son Patrick got a first-hand  Survivorexperience in Marquesas. You won a reward. He actually got to come out and spend the night at camp. Here's Patrick. <br/>PATRICK: Hey, Mom, what's going on? I was just here trying to do some reading. But, um, I just wanted to wish you good luck out there. I love you. Bring me home a million. Talk to you later. Bye. [laughter]  Not too focused on the almighty buck, is he? [laughing] He's just a funny kid. Good kid, great kid. They actually were concerned that I was doing this again, but  that's okay. Everything's going to be fine. <br/>Probst: Rupert, we've heard a lot about your wife Laura  and your daughter Raya-- two big, bright lights in your life. Here's a little love from home. <br/>Hi, Daddy. Yay! <br/>You know, by now, you've been on the island for a very  long time. We love you and we miss you horribly. <br/>Bye, Daddy! <br/>Bye, babe. <br/>Oh, your wife is beautiful. [sniffling]  I know they were worried about me. They were worried when I said I'd do this again. I told them I wasn't going to leave them and I turned around and  left. <br/>Probst: Jenna, the very first time we ever did videos from  home was in the very first season of Survivor,and the most heartbreaking  moment of that entire season...  Do not do it to me again. <br/>Probst: ...was when I had to tell you that we didn't get a  video from your family; it didn't make it in time. I'm happy to say that is not the case this time. Here's Sadie and Sabrina, your daughters and friend. <br/>Hi, Mom. [giggling] We miss you. We love you. <br/>I love her, I love her, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. <br/>Mom! Mom! <br/>Bye, Jenna! <br/>Aw...  Probst: Wow, those are cute girls. <br/>They're gorgeous. <br/>My babies... [sniffling] Ah, it's been 28 days just  thinking about what they look like and trying to remember every little  detail, and then seeing them, it's just the little things I notice, like, as  they're singing, Sabrina is using sign language 'cause she knows that I would  want to see that she's doing it. [sniffling] And their hair is short. Somebody cut their hair. <br/>Probst: Well, I must say, it's nice to see so much love. Everybody here had so much love pouring out. It's time now for the challenge. A lot at stake: letters from home, rain ponchos, and for  somebody-- one person-- immunity, their entire video, along with hot  chocolate and a warm place to watch it. If you want to share with everybody, you can. It's a monster challenge. Let's go find our teams. <br/>Probst: Okay, guys, at stake: letters from home and rain  ponchos. Here's how it's gonna work. You'll be divided into two groups of four. You will compete against each other as two groups of four. First phase of the obstacle course is called "The  Breakthrough," which you must literally break through a maze of jungle  timber. You'll then go across a balance beam. You must then go underneath the belly crawl. Four of you on each tribe must then navigate your way up and  over a ten-foot wall. This will bring you to the blown bridge where, with two planks,  you must navigate across a series of posts. Once you've completed that, you will scale up a very big wooden  ladder and make your way across a rope bridge. Once you get to the other side, one person will stay up on the  platform, the other three will go back down the ladder into a makeshift jail  cell, where you must dig up a tribe flag. Once you have that flag, signal the person still up on the  platform. They will race down the flying fox, retrieve a key. That key will unlock the jail cell, releasing the other three  tribe members. The first group of four to cross the finish line wins reward. In addition, the winning foursome moves on to compete in an  immunity challenge that will immediately follow. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: Let's pick teams. We'll get started. All right, Alicia and Rupert, randomly chosen as captains. You've chosen your teams. Rupert's team: Kathy, Big Tom and Jenna. Alicia's team: Shii Ann, Amber and Rob. For reward and immunity. Survivors ready? Go! <br/>Probst: You're dead even. Big Tom takes a header. Alicia and Rob breaking through. All four have to be out. Hit the balance beam. Rob is off. Rupert back to the start. Shii Ann, you're good. All four have to clear. Still waiting on Rupert and Big Tom. Let's go, all four under the belly crawl. Rupert's made it. Boston Rob. Shii Ann, Amber and Alicia are through. Hit the wall, guys. <br/>Okay, Tom, jump. <br/>Probst: Under the belly crawl. You're still in this. Alicia is first up and over. Boston Rob and Amber working with Shii Ann. Shii Ann is over. <br/>Good job. <br/>Probst: Shii Ann and Alicia pulling Boston Rob up. Boston Rob is up and over. Big Tom, once you're through, you guys can start on the wall. Amber, pulling both her limbs out, is up and over. Come on, guys, hit the wall! Think how you're going to do this. <br/>Come on. <br/>Probst: Got to navigate your way across these poles using  the two planks. Big Tom is up and over. Giving Kathy a hand. Kathy is up and over. Jenna is the last one. They've got her...  Let's go, Jenna! <br/>Probst: ...yanking her up. You're in this, guys. Grab your two planks. Boston Rob leading his tribe across. Decision time coming. <br/>Probst: Rob trying to reach the last platform. Gonna have to work together, figure this out. <br/>Here you go. No. <br/>Probst: Won't reach there either. Keep working, guys. <br/>Ye-Ye-Yeah. <br/>Probst: You're in this. <br/>Go back. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Go. <br/>Probst: Not much room to spare, but they figured it out. Amber making her way across. Stay with it, Rupert. You're still in this. Alicia across. All four across. Hit the ladder. <br/>Come on! Come on! <br/>Probst: One at a time across the rope bridge! <br/>There you go. Take your time. <br/>You got it. <br/>Probst: Shii Ann is across. Rupert. Jenna. Kathy. Big Tom. Get up the ladder. <br/>Don't panic. <br/>You got it. <br/>Probst: Amber making her way across the rope bridge. Alicia, you're up. <br/>Let's go, Rupe, you got it. Let it go, you got it. <br/>Go ahead, Jenna. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob, you're up. Rob skitters across, wasting no time. Shii Ann, Alicia and Amber got to get down the ladder and find  the flag buried. <br/>Come on, girls. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob, you're waiting for that flag. Once they have it, you can go down the flying fox. Thataway, Big Tom. <br/>Get that flag, go, guys! <br/>Probst: Get down the ladder. Jenna stays up top. Rupert, Big Tom and Kathy got to uncover the flag. Start digging, Rupert. <br/>Get that flag! Get it, get it, get it! <br/>Come on, girls! Find it. It's got to be in there. <br/>Probst: Keep digging, it's there. <br/>&gt; You guys, come on! <br/>Probst: Get it out of the hole. You've got it! Rob, hit it. Keep digging! [team shouting]  Probst: Boston Rob coming back with the key. <br/>Go, go, go, Jenna, go! <br/>Probst: He's got to get them unlocked. It's a race to the finish. <br/>Go, Jenna! [shouting]  Probst: Reward! And a shot at immunity for Boston Rob, Amber, Alicia and Shii  Ann. Okay. The four of you have already won a letter from home and a rain  poncho, which can be taken back to camp with you. We're now moving on to part two, the immunity challenge. It's a traditional Thai puzzle. Your goal is simple-- maneuver the puzzle pieces until the  largest piece of the puzzle, containing the knife, will slide out of the slot  at the bottom of the puzzle. Take the knife, chop the rope, raise your flag. The first tribe member to raise their flag wins immunity, is  safe from the vote tonight at Tribal Council and, in addition, gets a video  from home-- their entire video-- and a pitcher of hot chocolate to enjoy it  with. A lot at stake. Uncover your puzzles. Survivors ready? Go. Working the pieces around, trying to get that knife... out of  the bottom. Boston Rob close. Boston Rob has it, has his knife out. <br/>Move, come on! <br/>Probst: Boston Rob wins immunity and a video of his  brother, that I'm not sure anybody wants to see. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Nice job! <br/>Probst: Rob nice enough to share his hot chocolate with  everybody. <br/>Thanks. <br/>Everybody...  &gt; To Mogo Mogo. <br/>To Mogo Mogo. <br/>And our true families, too. <br/>Family and friends. <br/>Family and friends. <br/>&gt; Oh, is that good! <br/>It's really good. Oh, it tastes so good. <br/>Tastes like home. <br/>Oh, it's really good. <br/>I've got a proposition for you. <br/>Probst: All right. <br/>You know, my brother's gonna absolutely kill me... but we  have been living together for some time, and we had some bad blood yesterday. Is there any way, if I forego seeing the video, everybody could  get their letter? <br/>Oh! <br/>Please. I think it's the right thing to do, 'cause everybody's hurting  and everybody's missing home. <br/>Probst: Great offer. I can make that trade. <br/>Aw! <br/>He's so sweet. <br/>You guys would have done the exact same thing. <br/>Probst: Okay. Let's give out the reward. <br/>Yes! <br/>Probst: Alicia, here's your letter...  Thank you. <br/>Probst: ...and a rain poncho. <br/>I forgot about the ponchos! <br/>That's huge! <br/>Probst: Amber. Shii Ann. <br/>Your rain gear. <br/>Poncho! My rain gear. <br/>Probst: Boston Rob. And now, because of the generosity of Boston Rob, Rupert, here's  your letter from home. Kathy. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Probst: There's something from home. <br/>Thank you, Rob. <br/>Probst: Jenna. Big Tom. <br/>I hope it's a big 'un. <br/>Probst: You guys can get back to camp, find yourself a  private little spot and really enjoy this letter. 'Cause after that, game is back on. Tribal Council tonight. Boston Rob's the only guy who's safe. Sadly, this game will be coming to an end tonight for somebody. [birds chirping]  I can't wait to read this letter. <br/>Oh, my God, I'm so excited! <br/>So excited. I didn't get my letter the last time. Rob gave up seeing his family's videotape so that everyone could  have a letter from home. That was really big of him, and it showed a strength of  character that I hadn't realized about Rob Mariano. <br/>[voice breaking]: "I trust and know in my heart that  you're doing well and you're the strongest man." You know... [sniffles]  It's just uplifting. I like it that my wife and daughter think I'm the toughest,  baddest son of a bitch out there... even though I'm not. I like that, though. That gives me strength. I'll read it a thousand times in the next 11 days. <br/>I got a letter from my mom and dad. My dad says that he's never known a stronger person... that I've  done so much in my life...  These letters remind me of my... my real friends and my  family. And the friendships here, as nice as they are, it's not this. It's not this. It will never be this. [sniffling]  What Rob did today at the reward challenge was a generous  move, but it was also a strategic move. Giving up his brother's videotape for letters from home may win  him a million dollars. <br/>I don't remember the last time I was emotional about  anything, ever. And you know, I do feel bad-- my brother spent all that time  making the tape and everything. But this way, everybody won. And I know it's going to get perceived one way or the other,  it's inevitable. It wasn't about me. It wasn't about strategy. It was about strategy, to a degree. It's a good move, yeah. It is. I'm not going to sit here and tell you it's not. But me... my family is the most important thing in the world,  more than anything else, more than money, more than anything. [sniffles] But I'm still getting the million. I'm just having a... a little time-out for myself. <br/>I am not upset. I was upset about violating a friendship. Right then I threw emotion in my game. <br/>Emotion is in the game now, I mean...  You know what I mean. Like personal. <br/>I know. Honestly, I didn't know there was going to be a merge. <br/>Yeah. <br/>There was no way of telling for sure. <br/>It's over with. We don't have to go over it. <br/>I just wanted you to know, regardless of everything,  right, regardless of yesterday, like...  We're fine. <br/>Okay. <br/>We're fine. <br/>I was trying to be nice to Kathy. I know she's playing the game. I don't blame her. But to be completely honest, I have no idea how the vote is  going to go tonight. <br/>I don't know who they're going to pick off next, but it  might be you. <br/>It might be me, but it might not be. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Tonight the vote will come down to the last remaining...  original Mogo Mogo members, Kathy and I. <br/>Today his thing with the letters. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Although it was very generous, it was a totally smart  strategic move. <br/>That doesn't repair bad blood. To me, the letters-from-home trade for the video was just a  bone. You know, probably down deep in his heart, he wanted us all to  have the letters, but higher on the list was the fact that it might  counterbalance any of that anguish and anger that was exposed yesterday. If these guys were smart, man, somebody would take him out. <br/>Well, they will, as soon as he loses immunity. <br/>Yeah, they should, but, you know, Jenna, I think she  thinks she's going to be in the final three. <br/>She's not. <br/>I can feel it. <br/>If they can all convince Tom that he's in the final three. <br/>No, Tom knows he's not. Tom's smarter than that. It's time now to get Jenna, Amber and Rob Mariano out of the  power situation they're in. Maybe I could help these players see the light that maybe I  could be used as a swing vote. And they do it now instead of waiting to go down to seven. Hey, listen, you need to start reacting. You know, like at seven and five, you have to do something here. You are flaking around, baby doll. <br/>I think... I think about it. <br/>All right. Think about it at seven, because when you get down to  five...  Got to clean the house. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Cut Jenna out. <br/>Yeah, you should. I don't want her to win. <br/>You won't... she won't. <br/>Okay. <br/>Remember, key times to mix it  Okay. <br/>Remember, key times to mix it up is at seven and five. That's when I did it. Very difficult to do. If you want to save your ass, make sure you know what's going  on. <br/>I think we got some last-minute scrambling going on in  Panama today. Kathy and Shii Ann are working it. They'll probably go after Amber or Jenna. <br/>There might be something that could be done. <br/>Right. <br/>It would make sense. <br/>Oh, yeah, yeah, it would. <br/>Yeah, but you think they're going to take you to the final  three? <br/>Well, that's why... I know. You'd be a fool to sit here and...  Wait. <br/>...and not do nothing. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I've been sticking with my original deal, but when  everything is going too good, you'd better be looking out. It flies apart. And Shii Ann gives me another option. I will be weighing my options all the way out. <br/>Hey, Alicia, what were you saying... what were you saying  this morning when you said Shii Ann was talking about something? <br/>Kathy and Shii Ann are implanting bad thoughts into Alicia  and Big Tom's head. And they're buying it, I guess. And one person is all it would take to swing one or the other  one way or the other. [laughing]  I see it, it's happening right now. See them? Kathy, Shii Ann and Big Tom are all standing talking for a good  15 minutes. I think they're switching. My gut tells me that they wouldn't have talked that long if he  wasn't giving her an indication that he agreed. He's acting like he's not playing, but he's playing. And the same with Alicia. Alicia wouldn't even meet my eye. If those four do bond, it will be me they vote off. Alicia and Big Tom, I do worry about. Those two are the weak points, because at this point, us four  have been so wrapped up in the fact that we have a four alliance strong,  nobody has bothered to try to like draw in Big Tom and Alicia and let them  believe that they have an alliance with the final four, too. They might decide to save themselves and go to the final four  with the other two. That's what burned me in the first game. Perhaps I'm about to be burned at Tribal Council. <br/>Probst: We now bring in the first member of our jury, Lex,  voted out at the last Tribal Council. Hello, guys. Let's talk about the past few days. Kathy, this has been an odd Survivorin that, at times, it's been  as catty as ever a Survivorhas been, and then there are other times when I  can't figure out how you guys are going to continue to vote people out  because I truly believe you've formed a little nucleus here. <br/>That's what I'm having a hard time throughout the whole  game is, you know, when do you start playing and when do you back off? And when do friendships set in? It's been difficult. <br/>Probst: Big Tom, you've made some friends here that are  going to make it really tough to vote them out? <br/>It's always hard to put that name down of somebody else,  but it's easier to put their names down than to see mine come up. I come to win and I want to win, but I want to win with class,  too. <br/>Probst: Rob, how do you win this game with class? <br/>I think All-Star Survivor is a little bit different than  other Survivorsin the respect that there are real friendships that were  formed before we were even here. And then you come into the game situation, and is it about  friendship or are you playing a game? And it's been a big problem for me the last couple days. I gave my word on something, and I said that that was what I was  gonna do this time and keep it. So, there's no real answer to that question. Class, define class. You know? <br/>Probst: So, at this point, Shii Ann, why not vote you out  tonight? What are you doing that should keep you in this game? <br/>You know, being one of two remaining last original Mogo  Mogo members, I'm in the minority. And, of course, I am a target tonight. But I think that when people are voting from now on, they're  going to have to start looking at who do I want to take with me to the final  two and who can I beat? If all this talk about alliance here tonight is true, which I doubt,  then I'm the next to go, and I've played as many cards as I can, but, you  know, it's not the end for me yet. I may still win immunity. I'm a survivor. I'm here to win, and I will not go down without a fight. <br/>Probst: Kathy, why are you voting the way you're voting  tonight? <br/>I'm voting for the person that lied to me, and not that  lying is something that shouldn't happen in Survivor, but I didn't like the  way it went down. So, I just have to warn you guys, that just so you know, it's,  it's... it's gonna be tough scrambling when it gets down to seven. You guys, you don't even know what's going to hit you, because  people are going to be rethinking, and the fact of the matter is, you're  going to be short players for options. The heat is so intense when you get to seven, I think that, you  know, different combinations should have been occurring when Lex was on. <br/>Probst: All right, Rob, you have the immunity necklace. You cannot vote for Rob. Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote. Shii Ann, you're up. <br/>Amber, same old vote. Shii Ann, you're up. <br/>Amber, same old vote. You need to play a new game or else you're not going to make it. See you later. <br/>Kathy. I don't discredit you for trying, but you didn't honestly think  I was going to let you win. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote, Amber. Kathy. One vote Kathy, one vote Amber. Amber. Two votes Amber, one vote Kathy. Kathy. Two votes Kathy, two votes Amber. Three votes Kathy. It's four votes Kathy. 11th person voted out of Survivor All-Stars,second member of our  jury: Kathy. <br/>All right, you guys. Keep your eye on the million bucks. Good-bye. <br/>I love you. <br/>Probst: Kathy, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Well, you're certainly a very different group from the last time  you were here, both physically and emotionally. Judging from tonight's Tribal Council, there's certainly a whole  lot of game left. Grab your torches, go back to camp. Good night.

It ain't gonna be me. <br/>I'm as scared as all of them, but I'm not letting them see  it. <br/>Damn, I can't believe I got voted off. I can't believe. I thought Rob was going to be there for me. It was stupid actually, it was a stupid play. [growls] But that's what happens when you put too much trust and  loyalty into your thought process out here. I wish I had gotten... further. I wanted that million bucks so bad 'cause I got robbed last  time.
