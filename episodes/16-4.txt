<br/>Â Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor... [ thunder]  ...by day ten, the situation was grim for the fans.  <br/>Everyone is freezing. Everyone is cold.  <br/>Probst: Having won no reward challenges, they were hungry  and weak, and their inability to build a shelter made a bad situation  worse.  <br/>I am sure the other tribe is probably laughing about us  right now.  <br/>Probst: A bitter power struggle emerged between Joel and  Mikey B.  <br/>Mikey seems to think that he's running the show over here,  and I have to put a stop to it.  <br/>Probst: So Joel turned on Mikey B. by arranging to have  his closest ally voted out.  <br/>I'll get Joel. You mark my words about that one.  <br/>Probst: At the immunity challenge...  <br/>Oh!  <br/>Probst: Fans win immunity! ...the fans pulled off a  stunning upset, and the favorites were thrown into the hot seat. At  Malakal...  <br/>So should we think about working a little bit  together?  <br/>Oh, I definitely want to think about that.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Probst: ...Cirie convinced Jonathan and his alliance that  she was with them.  <br/>As long as we stay strong, then we're cool.  <br/>Probst: But later she joined the alliance of James and  Parvati and Amanda and Ozzy.  <br/>I want to vote Yau, because if Yau gets to Exile Island  one time...  <br/>Oh, yeah.  <br/>...forget about it.  <br/>Going up against Yau...  <br/>You'll never win.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: James and Ozzy wanted to vote out Eliza, believing  she was the weakest member of the tribe.  <br/>It makes more sense to vote Eliza.  <br/>Eliza, please? Please, please.  <br/>Come on, Cirie.  <br/>Why is it...  <br/>Because we need his strength right now.  <br/>Honestly, I don't want to change my vote.  <br/>Probst: At tribal council, Jonathan was angered by Cirie's  betrayal.  <br/>I thought I was in alliance with you. Until today, I  was.  <br/>Jonathan, I came into your alliance as the fifth  person.  <br/>Were you in the alliance?  <br/>Am I supposed to trust you?  <br/>Were you in the alliance? Did you say you were in the  alliance?  <br/>Probst: In the end, Cirie got one vote. Cirie. But she  also got her way. Third person voted out of Fans vs. Favorites,Yau-Man. 17  are left. 17 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out  tonight?  <br/>I was, I was.  <br/>It was just an hour before tribal...  <br/>And I was.  <br/>Then you changed your mind.  <br/>You know why?  <br/>But you didn't communicate that with me.  <br/>Whatever. I wasn't even talking to you.  <br/>What?  <br/>I wasn't even talking to you.  <br/>I'm sorry. I'm here. Cirie flipped. She gave us her word  that she was tight with us. She saw a better chance, and she took it, at my  expense. And the truth is that she's much more manipulative and devious than  I am.  <br/>And I'm trying...  <br/>That's kind of disgusting.  <br/>I don't. I'm grown. I don't have to hear what you have to  say. Why do I...  <br/>Yes, you do.  <br/>No, I don't. Jonathan is pissed off to the hilt. He's just  mad that he couldn't make me vote the way he wanted me to.  <br/>You didn't trust me anyway. You used me as an excuse to  flop.  <br/>I didn't trust you. I'm just done. You know that I broke  your alliance. I don't trust you. You don't trust me. Everybody knows it.  Everybody knows it. Done. Done.

We're very, very  pleased. You know, there's been some dissension amongst people within the  tribe, and I think this was good for us.  <br/>Check it out!  <br/>Oh, what was that?  <br/>No! Yeah!  <br/>Nice!  <br/>Oh, yeah!  <br/>Nice.  <br/>Whew!  <br/>Nice.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Yeah, you did. Chop his head off.  <br/>Come and get it.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>It's going to be like a hot dog.  <br/>It better be like a hot dog.  <br/>Whew!  <br/>You always need to be pulling your weight. You always need  to be doing what you need to do to maintain a position. All I've done since I  have been here is keep my head down and work. This is where the rub is for  me. I don't feel like Chet really wants to help out and carry his weight. How  do you not say, "Dude, like, How do you not say, "Dude, like,  either pick it up or go home"? either pick it up or go home"?  <br/>What?  <br/>That.  <br/>Yeah, it's about 2:00. Time for Chet's bedtime. Wouldn't  you say?  <br/>I don't even know how. If I did that and I got back, my  mom would spank me.  <br/>Chet is distraught and weak and just decimated. He is not  in this game right now. He's a physical and mental liability, and he's  horrible for morale around camp. He's gone. He's gone. Chet is gone. Chet is  gone.  <br/>I feel really sick. My ears are hurting. My sinuses are  hurting. My glands are swollen. I feel like I'm probably the next to go if we  lose another immunity challenge because my tribe thinks I am weak, and tribe  thinks I am weak, and being sick doesn't help that. being sick doesn't help  that.  <br/>Last night at tribal council was kind of rough, because  I'm all about keeping the strongest people. We kept one of the weakest girls,  Eliza, and she's sick right now. She's on the beach, shivering, about to pass  out. But being that Cirie was so hell bent on getting Yau-Man out, kind of  folded to her will, kind of folded to her will, which was a big mistake.  which was a big mistake.  <br/>I'm just taking it easy so I can perform really well in  the challenge.  <br/>But I didn't know you were so sick.  <br/>It's not contagious.  <br/>It's not about being contagious. It's about being in a  weaker state.  <br/>But I'm going to be fine. Even being slightly sick, I'm  still going to better at whatever challenge we have today than Yau-Man would  have. After they found out that I was sick, right to my face Ozzy and James  said, "Oh, we should have voted you out last night; we wish we'd voted  you out last night." So that made me feel like crap. You know, acting  like that towards me doesn't make me want to perform well in the challenge. I  mean, if you were a little bit I mean, if you were a little bit supportive, I  think that'd help. supportive, I think that'd help. [ laughter]  <br/>I hate these people. I do. I mean, I almost hope that they  get sicker than I am and have to be removed from the game. be removed from  the game. [ laughter] [ laughter] [ laughter]  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! Fans getting your first look at  the new tribe of favorites. Yau-Man voted out at the last tribal  council.  <br/>No way.  <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?  <br/>Oh, yeah.  <br/>Probst: Here is how it works. On my go, four members from  each tribe will swim out to a floating platform. One at a time, you'll dive  down to a 30-foot-long steel cage containing tribe-colored coconuts, ten of  which have letters painted on them. You'll remove your tribe's lettered  coconuts from the cage one at a time and place them in a floating bin. You'll  then swim the bin back to shore, where the four remaining tribe members will  use those letters to unscramble a one-word answer. Want to know what you're  playing for?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: I think you're going to like it.  <br/>Oh, that's nice.  <br/>Wow!  <br/>Probst: Three egg-laying hens, one rooster. Got some  chicken feed as well. They've already laid three eggs since they've been  here. In addition, the winning tribe will choose one member from the losing  tribe to go to Exile Island. You will also select somebody from your own  tribe to join them. Fans, you have one extra person, sitting somebody out.  You cannot sit out the same person in back-to-back challenges. Who's it going  to be?  <br/>I am.  <br/>Chet.  <br/>Probst: Chet going to sit this one out. Give you a minute  to strategize, Give you a minute to strategize, and we'll get started. and  we'll get started. Here we go, for reward. Survivors ready. Go! All four  tribe members have to be on the platform before the first person can go down.  Go. It's Ozzy and Jason swimming out It's Ozzy and Jason swimming out first.  first. Jason making his way along the cage. Ozzy spending a lot of time under  water. He's still working at the end of He's still working at the end of the  cage. the cage. Jason up with the first coconut for the fans.  <br/>Come on, Jay!  <br/>Probst: Mikey B. in the water for the fans. Ozzy starting  to make his way forward now. Looks like he is moving several coconuts at  once.  <br/>Jason!  <br/>Yep.  <br/>You know what Ozzy is doing, right?  <br/>Yep.  <br/>Pushing all their letters forward.  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Probst: Mikey B. up with the second coconut for the fans.  Ozzy with the first coconut for the favorites. Go! Penner in the water for  the favorites. Penner swims out to the front of the cage, where Ozzy has  pushed a coconut forward. Penner up with the second coconut for the  favorites. We're tied two coconuts each. Favorites now with three coconuts.  And Parvati up with the fourth coconut for the favorites. Ozzy's strategy  starting to pay off. Favorites lead 4-2. Alexis has the third coconut for the  fans-- 4-3. Jason back in the water. Favorites now have five coconuts.  coconuts. There are ten coconuts total. There are ten coconuts total.  Favorites now with six coconuts. Fans have four. Ami in the water now. Mikey  B. in the water for the fans. Ami up with the seventh coconut Ami up with the  seventh coconut for the favorites. for the favorites. Mikey B. up with the  fifth coconut for the fans. coconut for the fans. It is 7-5. It is 7-5.  Natalie up with the sixth coconut for the fans. It is 7-6.  <br/>Good job.  <br/>Probst: Fans have worked their way back into it. We are  tied 7-7. Ozzy up with the eighth coconut Ozzy up with the eighth coconut for  the favorites. for the favorites. Penner up with the ninth coconut. One  coconut left for the One coconut left for the favorites. favorites. Ozzy up  with the tenth coconut for the favorites. Everybody out to the bin now.  Unclip and swim it back to shore. The favorites are on the move. Jason up  with the eighth coconut for the fans. Fans still have two coconuts in the  water. Mikey B. heading out as the favorites are already swimming in to  shore. Start working on that puzzle. Favorites with a big lead thanks to  Ozzy's strategy. It is a one-word answer. It is a one-word answer. You've got  to unscramble. You've got to unscramble.  <br/>Oh, yeah, that might be it. T-r...  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>All right, if I come up with the damn puzzle, come  on.  <br/>Probst: Mikey B. up with the ninth coconut for the  fans.  <br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah! We got it!  <br/>We got it!  <br/>Probst: James thought he knew what it was, and he was  right: "triumphant." Favorites win reward! [ cheers and  applause]  <br/>Hey, how about that?  <br/>Oh, smarty pants.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Favorites, congratulations. Three hens, one  rooster, chicken feed-- up to you what you do with them. Big decision now.  You're going to choose one person from the tribe of fans to go to Exile  Island. Who's going?  <br/>Jeff, unfortunately, we're sending Kathy again.  <br/>Probst: Kathy's going to Exile Island. Favorites, who is  going to join her?  <br/>Ozzy.  <br/>Probst: All right, Ozzy and Kathy, get your stuff. The  boat's waiting for you. You will rejoin your tribe at the next immunity  challenge. Fans, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.  Favorites, come get your reward. Favorites, come get your reward.  Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations.  <br/>Chicken.  <br/>Chicken.  <br/>We lost our challenge today. It's always a bummer to lose  a challenge. Malakal has won every reward challenge. They've got four  freaking chickens now and eggs and everything else. They're living a life of  luxury out here compared to what we've got, which is, you know, jack  squat.  <br/>Ozzy is insane! He is, hands down, the best physical  competitor in survival history. Man. I was, like, jealous of Kathy. When they  were like, "Yeah, she's going to Exile," I was, like, "She's  going to eat better than we've eaten in nine days."  <br/>Kathy is a weak person. The other team definitely sees  this just by the way Kathy is. I mean, I'm pretty confident she's not looking  for that idol right now. I'm pretty confident she's curled up in the fetal  position curled up in the fetal position just trying to stay alive. just  trying to stay alive.  <br/>Ah!  <br/>Look at you. See, that's why you impress me so much, for a  scrawny little kid. I love meeting the favorites. I wish I was on their  tribe. Cirie, Ami, now Ozzy. I'm learning from you guys. You know, so each  time I'm learning something, which I appreciate and I pick up and I try to  use..  <br/>Open coconuts, boil water, make fire.  <br/>I mean, being here with you guys is cool, but being here  is not cool. I don't care about the immunity idol. I mean, I did that, done  that, been there. I don't feel like doing it no more.  <br/>Let's get some clams, because I'm hungry.  <br/>All right.  <br/>I'm going to go look. KB, my partner from the Airai Tribe,  is so dishearted that she doesn't even want to look for the idol. So I told  her I'm just going to go look for some food, and she go look for some food,  and she is, hopefully, making a fire. is, hopefully, making a fire. I don't  know if I'm going to find the idol today, but at least I'll get a little bit  closer. I've already found two clues, so I'm on a little bit of a roll.  There's not that much sunlight left, and I want to see if I can find it  before the sun goes find it before the sun goes down. down. If I can find the  idol, that would make things so much easier. There's a lot of guys out there  that want to beat me. It's really key that I find the It's really key that I  find the idol. idol. "Look in a place where you made your  arrival"-- "where you made your arrival"-- "where you  made your arrival." your arrival." I can kind of relax a little  bit. Now it's just a question of being sly enough to put it back in my hat,  sneak it back in my bag without her seeing. A big piece of wood just, like,  washed up, I think, at night.  <br/>Are you talking about that big, long piece that's over  there?  <br/>Yeah. That's a nice piece.  <br/>Yeah, I moved that up. We had a little fire, and then it  went out. it went out.  <br/>It'll get going.  <br/>It'll get going.  <br/>It'll get going.  <br/>Yeah, pretty much.  <br/>Yeah, pretty much. Taking a lesson from Yau-Man and  Peih-Gee, I'm just going to try and fashion some sort of fake idol. Just got  to make it look Just got to make it look semiprofessional.  semiprofessional.  <br/>It's like a spiny starfish. I don't think so.  <br/>You didn't see any clams out here on this side?  <br/>Um, not really.  <br/>I'm so tired of eating coconut, though.  <br/>Yeah. This is Igor, the immunity idol, the fake immunity  idol. God, I hope someone finds it and tries to play it. I think, if I wrap  it up in that cloth that I found it in and hide it in the exact same place,  that it's worth a shot. I think it'll work, at least for some time, throw  people off the trail a little bit. Hopefully it can do some good or some bad.  some bad. Do your job now, buddy. Do your job now, buddy. [ rooster  crowing]  <br/>Hey, Charlie. Anybody you'd like me to call, Charlie, give  them your last good-byes? Go in peace-- or pieces. [ laughter]  <br/>Good morning, Gloria. Charlie, I think you might be headed  for the slaughterhouse today. If we don't win today, I might be headed for  the slaughterhouse too, so I know how you're too, so I know how you're  feeling, buddy. feeling, buddy.  <br/>I don't know. I really haven't made up my mind.  <br/>I'm telling you that I would be loyal to you to the end,  and I don't think Jonathan could make that promise.  <br/>Jonathan will make that promise, and he won't keep  it.  <br/>Well, but he's a liar, and you know that better than  anyone. I love that Jonathan's pissing people off, and also he's somebody who  they know they can't trust, so I'm hoping that they realize that he's a much  more dangerous person to keep around because of the ease with which he would  flip.  <br/>You make a very valid point, I think.  <br/>He's a charmer.  <br/>He's a charmer. He's an actor. He's an actor.  <br/>Well, you just came... like, you came off guns blazing  right you came off guns blazing right out of the gates. out of the  gates.  <br/>Eliza and Parvati were talking, and I overtook them. All I  heard was "Get rid of Jonathan. He really doesn't like you. He's told me  that he wants to..." She'll say anything she needs to say, and it's so  painful to watch somebody on the outside who's trying to get back on the  inside. I totally understand. I feel sorry for her.  <br/>He followed us on purpose.  <br/>He gets so paranoid.  <br/>He gets so paranoid.  <br/>Kind of.  <br/>Kind of.  <br/>Eliza's just trying to stay in the game, you know? She's  trying to save her butt now. So she's kind of selling Jonathan, like,  throwing him under the bus. And I'd say if we went to tribal tonight, Eliza  would be going home. So yeah, she should be saying anything she can to save  herself anything she can to save herself right now. right now. right  now.  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys!  <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Ozzy and  Kathy, returning from Exile Island.  <br/>You all right?  <br/>It was long, longer than I thought.  <br/>Probst: Ozzy, I'm guessing Exile wasn't so much tough as  it was an opportunity to get a clue to the idol, maybe get an idea where it  might be.  <br/>I guess I was just thinking all the clues are going to be  in the same place and maybe it would be as easy as just digging a hole or  something. But it's a lot harder than I thought it was going to be.  <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?  <br/>Absolutely.  <br/>Probst: First things first, Erik, give up the immunity  idol. Erik, give up the immunity idol. Thanks. Thanks. Once again, immunity  is back up for grabs. On my go, six tribe members will race to a large  six-point sliding hub, which is secured to a stand using six locks. Each  player must find the one key that works for their lock. You must then  maneuver through the forest by shifting, sliding, and adjusting each other,  collecting money bead necklaces along the way. Once you've collected all six  necklaces, the two remaining tribe members will take the six necklaces and  place them on the decoding wheel. If the necklaces are arranged correctly,  the letters that correspond with the tribecolored beads will combine to form  a three-word phrase. The first tribe to get it right wins immunity, safe  another day. Losing tribe, tribal council, another person will be voted out.  Worth playing for?  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>Probst: Fans, you have one extra member, sitting out. You  cannot sit out the same person in back-to-back challenges. Chet sat out in  the last challenge. Who's it going to be?  <br/>Tracy.  <br/>All right.  <br/>Probst: Tracy going to sit this one out. Tracy, take a  spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategy, we'll  get started. All right, here we go. Solving the puzzle for the fans, Chet and  Kathy-- for the favorites, Cirie and Eliza. For immunity, survivors ready.  Go!  <br/>Come on, guys.  <br/>There you go, guys.  <br/>Oh, careful!  <br/>Probst: All six tribe members got to get in the harness  before you start unlocking. It going to take teamwork to win It going to take  teamwork to win this challenge. this challenge.  <br/>In.  <br/>I'm in.  <br/>Probst: Favorites are in. Start unlocking.  <br/>Good job, guys.  <br/>Probst: Ozzy has his undone. Passes over to James. Fans  are in. Start unlocking.  <br/>You got it, Erik.  <br/>Probst: There are six keys. One key fits one lock. A  little bit of luck involved finding the right key. James has his undone.  Parvati now working on her lock.  <br/>Come on, Parv.  <br/>You got to pull it, bro.  <br/>Probst: Erik can't find the key, passes off to Natalie.  Going to have to come back to Erik. Parvati has hers open. Ami now working on  her lock.  <br/>Take your time.  <br/>Probst: Favorites are halfway there.  <br/>Got it.  <br/>Probst: Natalie opens her lock.  <br/>Good job, Nat.  <br/>Probst: Joel now working on his.  <br/>You got it, Ami.  <br/>Probst: Ami has her lock undone. Penner now working on  his. Joel has his lock. Jason now working on his lock.  <br/>Go, Jason.  <br/>That's it, that's it. Pass it off.  <br/>Probst: Penner has his open.  <br/>Good job.  <br/>Probst: Favorites down to one lock. Once Amanda is open,  they're free.  <br/>Come on, Amanda.  <br/>Probst: Amanda quickly gets hers.  <br/>Okay, let's go.  <br/>Good job, guys! Good job!  <br/>Probst: Favorites, all unlocked, headed onto the  course.  <br/>Come on, guys! Don't give up!  <br/>Come on, man!  <br/>Probst: Favorites doing a good job right away of figuring  out how to maneuver in the sliding hub. Jason has his open.  <br/>Let's go!  <br/>Probst: Alexis now working.  <br/>Let's go, Alexis!  <br/>Through the middle. Through the middle.  <br/>Probst: Favorites are out on the course with a big  lead.  <br/>Ami, want to get the first necklace?  <br/>Yeah, I got one.  <br/>Probst: Ami has the first necklace for the favorites.  Alexis has her lock open. Favorites making quick work of this course. Fans  falling further behind, still working on their locks.  <br/>All right.  <br/>Probst: They are not out of the gate yet.  <br/>Okay, got it.  <br/>Probst: Parvati grabs the third necklace for the  favorites.  <br/>Let Amanda come through.  <br/>Go, Amanda.  <br/>Are you through?  <br/>You got it?  <br/>Probst: Amanda has a necklace for the favorites. They're  down to two necklaces left.  <br/>It's okay, guys. Everyone take a deep breath.  <br/>Probst: Erik finally gets his lock open. Fans have a lot  of ground to make up.  <br/>Careful, careful, careful.  <br/>Lift up and push the rope.  <br/>Let Ozzy come through.  <br/>Probst: Ozzy has a necklace for the favorites.  <br/>Wait, wait, wait. Go around that side.  <br/>I can't, y'all.  <br/>Probst: Fans having trouble making any sense of this  course and how to work with the hub.  <br/>Yes! One more, one more, guys!  <br/>Probst: One necklace left for the favorites. James reaches  for it and has it. Favorites are heading back now with all six  necklaces.  <br/>You guys go through the middle.  <br/>Hey, hey, hey! Ow, ow! You're going to break my legs. One  second, one second. I can't move. I have no where to go.  <br/>Probst: Fans just now out on the course.  <br/>I have one. Should I get it?  <br/>Probst: Erik has a necklace for the fans.  <br/>James, go back as far as you can.  <br/>Probst: Experience clearly paying off for the favorites--  not even close.  <br/>Ozzy come all the way this way. Hurry up. Get on the  mat.  <br/>We're on the mat. We're on the mat.  <br/>Probst: Favorites are back. Go! Give up those  necklaces.  <br/>Go, baby, go.  <br/>Probst: Eliza, Cirie, start working on that puzzle. You  got to match up the tribecolored beads with the correct letter.  <br/>Natalie, move forward, move forward.  <br/>Probst: Mikey B. has a necklace for the fans.  <br/>R-i-b-e. We need a purple one right here.  <br/>Ready? Purple right here.  <br/>Turn, turn, turn.  <br/>"Tribe."  <br/>Okay.  <br/>Probst: Eliza, Cirie with a big lead working on this  puzzle.  <br/>S-t-a-y.  <br/>"Stay."  <br/>"Tribe stay."  <br/>"Stays," it's going to be  "stays."  <br/>I got this one.  <br/>Probst: Natalie has a necklace for the fans. Fans now have  three of their necklaces.  <br/>Come on, guys. You're still in it.  <br/>Okay, rotate.  <br/>Probst: Fans three necklaces short of getting back.  <br/>You guys got this.  <br/>"In."  <br/>Probst: Eliza and Cirie think they may have it. Jason has  a necklace for the fans. They're down to two necklaces left.  <br/>"Intact." Wait a minute.  <br/>Oh, my God.  <br/>"Intact." Is it "i-n-t-a-c-t"? See if  this fits.  <br/>Probst: Eliza and Cirie think they have it right.  <br/>"Tribe stays intact."  <br/>Probst: "Tribe stays intact" is right. Favorites  win immunity! [ cheering]  <br/>I love you guys! I love you guys! I love you guys! I love  you guys! Good job!  <br/>Probst: Favorites, congratulations. [ applause] Immunity,  no tribal council tonight, nobody going home. Fans, different story. We do  have tribal council tonight. Somebody is going home. You have the afternoon  to figure out who that's going to be. Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.  Favorites, you guys can head out. out. [ cheering] [ cheering]  <br/>The crew of misfits which is Airai lost again, not even  close again. Yeah, yeah, we got some talent. I don't know what Joel has up  his sleeve. He backstabbed me early in the game and voted off Mary. So my  goal is to pretend that I'm Joel's ally and that I forgive him, vote Chet  out. I'll keep Joel around as long as I can, until right before the merge,  and then cut his damn merge, and then cut his damn head off. head off.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>You know, my mind is just spinning just the fact that he's  still here, you know? And so he is the weakest. He is the weakest. He is the  weakest. And if we get rid of him, then that'll make me feel secure about  your position to me.  <br/>Sure.  <br/>Where you're still in control of the game, but you're not  dominating the game, you know, as far as my position.  <br/>No, I hear you, but I'd rather have Kathy out.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>But I hear you.  <br/>But, you know, just food for  <br/>But, you know, just food for thought. thought.  thought.  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>Seriously.  <br/>Seriously.  <br/>Who's us?  <br/>Who's us?  <br/>You all right, buddy?  <br/>No.  <br/>Yeah, you are.  <br/>Things are very crazy. I think it's very possible that  Chet could go home tonight. I think Chet could go home just like that. So if  Chet's gone, that's one of my votes, and then Kathy, that's my votes, and  then Kathy, that's two, and then I'll be next. two, and then I'll be  next.  <br/>My mind is in the game. My head is in the game. My body is  out of the game, and My body is out of the game, and it's not by my choice.  it's not by my choice.  <br/>You know, we need to stick together. Let's take it to the  next level. Let's try to stir it up. I may not have a lot of power here in  this tribe, but I can tell you this much: I'm going to go down with a fight.  Why not?  <br/>What's up?  <br/>Yo.  <br/>I'm going to help with wood.  <br/>So truthfully, who are y'all voting for? voting for?  <br/>Chet and Kathy.  <br/>Chet and Kathy.  <br/>That'll happen. Just... it can't happen right now, I don't  think. We need his strength right now to win challenges. Basically, Mikey and  Jason feel that Chet is weak, rundown, and the rest of them, I'm not... I  think they're going to do whatever Mikey asks them to do.  <br/>Why are you letting him call the shots right now? I don't  understand that.  <br/>I don't know. Am I letting him? I don't know.  <br/>Yes, you are.  <br/>Yeah, you're letting him.  <br/>You think so?  <br/>Absolutely, dude. You're rolling over. You are. I mean,  it's crazy. You said you were going to get Mike off a long time ago. Here's  your opportunity. I don't understand what... I'm angry with you about it. I'm  going to be honest with you.  <br/>Yeah.  <br/>I mean, you're freaking just following, like...  <br/>No, I think...  <br/>Like a herd of cattle down the road.  <br/>I am threatened by Mikey. That's why I wanted to get Mary  out so early, because of the two of them together. And maybe I should have  gone with Mikey on the first vote with Mikey on the first vote versus Mary.  versus Mary.  <br/>Oh, yeah. Oh, he took that very personal. And that's why I  know that I've got a target on my back from him.  <br/>Mike's going to take you down the next chance he gets  because of what you did to Mary.  <br/>I think he will, absolutely.  <br/>Okay, so this is his next chance. Just be aware of  that.  <br/>And you know what?  <br/>Well, what are you hearing? Why are you saying that? What  are you hearing?  <br/>I'm just very intuitive, and I know a lot of stuff just  because I do, because I'm born with it. And I'm not saying that I'm some type  of guru or anything like that.  <br/>No, no.  <br/>It's just that the writing is  <br/>It's just that the writing is on the wall, seriously. on  the wall, seriously. All you need is one person, and All you need is one  person, and we can take Mike down. we can take Mike down. we can take Mike  down.  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>Uh-huh.  <br/>If one of us is gone, you're done. We can't help you  anymore. We can't. We can't do anything. But with five, we can do  something.  <br/>So you guys are wanting to vote Mikey.  <br/>Yes.  <br/>We'll see. Tonight will be interesting.  <br/>Personally, I think it's going to go me tonight. That's  what I'm thinking.  <br/>And that would mean that Joel did the wrong thing. did the  wrong thing.  <br/>Whatever.  <br/>Whatever.  <br/>Probst: Sorry to see you guys here. After tonight's vote,  you'll be even with the favorites. So, Jason, that might imply that the game  is even. Do you think it is?  <br/>Right now, I would definitely say that the favorites have  an advantage. We've lost four of the past six challenges. But you know, maybe  tonight's tribal council will be able to make a stronger tribe.  <br/>Probst: Joel, how important is it to keep a tribe strong  in terms of winning challenges?  <br/>It's extremely important. You know, the weaker our  individuals are, the weaker we are as a team.  <br/>Probst: Who here will own up to the fact that maybe they  haven't delivered that well in challenges? Chet, what's been lacking?  <br/>For me, probably maybe the first challenge I did in the  water was a little bit more than what I thought it was. But when it comes to  certain challenges, I can take certain roles where I wouldn't need that  extreme strength.  <br/>Probst: So other than that challenge, you feel pretty good  about your effort?  <br/>Yes, I do.  <br/>To be honest with you, Chet has been hurting. I mean,  Chet's been exhausted for four days straight. It's nothing personal against  him. I just don't think he has the physical capacity to compete.  <br/>Can I say something? I didn't compete, and Chet didn't  compete, and Kathy didn't compete, and they still lost. So tell me how you  can take blame for that.  <br/>Probst: Mikey B., in a perfect world, what happens when  you go back to camp tonight?  <br/>I just want to vote out the people who are weak and who  are physically unable to perform. And I hope people who told me the way they  were voting tonight stick to it, because sometimes you have to give a little  trust to earn a little trust.  <br/>Probst: Erik, there seems to be somewhat of a consensus  that we need to keep the tribe physically strong for challenges. Do you agree  with that?  <br/>I agree we need to keep this tribe strong, but it's not  about physical attributes in all these challenges. I think that there's more  to it than that.  <br/>Probst: Joel, you were almost nodding in agreement.  <br/>I think strength is not just physical strength. Am I the  biggest, strongest guy on this team? Yes. But that doesn't mean that I'm  going to be the number-one person in every challenge that we have.  <br/>Exactly. My point is really there's a direct way to go  about something, but that's not the best way. I mean, you can run into a wall  100 times; that's not the best way to get rid of a wall.  <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to vote. Jason.  <br/>Again I need to emphasize the importance of tonight's vote  in determining our future as a tribe. We have lost four of six challenges. So  take a moment to really think about how important it is who we keep on the  island and who we let go.  <br/>Probst: Any other comments from anybody else? All right.  Now it is time to vote. Now it is time to vote. Jason, you're up. Jason,  you're up. Jason, you're up.  <br/>Please leave the island.  <br/>Please leave the island.  <br/>Mike, you've been a loud mouth from day one, and you mouth  from day one, and you never seem to learn. never seem to learn.  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. If anybody has the  hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now is the time to do so. Okay,  once the votes are read, the decision is final.

Drop your buffs.

Don't trust Joel. He's going to  stab you in the back. It was obvious who needed to go. I wish I was in the  game longer. I guess I came out too strong. But I was never lazy. I always  did what I could to help the tribe. So yeah, they're going to miss So yeah,  they're going to miss me, no doubt.
