           Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor:  Come here. Hurry, hurry. <br/>This is going too great. <br/>Yeah, it's, like, too good to be true, man. <br/>Probst: Moto continued to grow stronger. <br/>It's not even survival, it's thrival. <br/>Probst: While Ravu became weaker and weaker. Until the sun came out-- then Ravu transformed its rays into fire. <br/>Awesome! <br/>We're not going to die! <br/>Probst: At the reward challenge, Gary took a hard fall, but Moto still came  out ahead. <br/>Dre scores for Moto! <br/>Probst: Giving Moto more fishing gear and widening the gap between the two  tribes. <br/>Sylvia. <br/>Probst: Sylvia was sent to Exile Island where she received a pivotal clue to  the whereabouts of the idol hidden back at camp. <br/>"You'll find it under the cave's threshold if you dig deep." I need  to figure out a time and a place to look for the idol as quickly as possible. <br/>Probst: At Moto...  He can't breathe. <br/>Probst: ...Gary was beginning to feel ill. <br/>We're going to keep a close eye on him. His health is more important than the game to us. <br/>Probst: But at the immunity challenge... Papa Smurf starting on his second  snout. Gary pulled through when Anthony was unable to chew a pig snout. Moto wins immunity again! Before tribal council...  Does he irk you at all, or no? He seems a little on the whiny side. <br/>Probst: ...Anthony and Sylvia were both on the hot seat, and Sylvia's only  hope was finding the hidden immunity idol. <br/>If I get the idol and if the vote does go my way, I will be able to surprise  everybody. <br/>Probst: At tribal council, Anthony questioned his position in the tribe. <br/>I often wonder if these folks even like me. I like to think they like me, but, you know, sometimes you can't tell. <br/>Probst: Mookie, what's your thought on what Anthony said? <br/>After the challenge, I was really pissed off. When you take a little piece of snout this small, you can will yourself to  throw it down. <br/>Probst: But when Sylvia failed to produce the idol, she was voted out of the  game. Sylvia, the tribe has spoken. 16 are left. 16 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>We going to start a fire or what? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Let's just get the fire going. We will talk about whatever needs to be talked about, get it all out. Just all this silly stuff just has to go. When we came back to camp, I wanted us all to have a powwow. I mean, people have problems with certain people, personality problems, and  they don't say anything. So that other person doesn't know. So this just keeps on going and pressure builds up and then people explode. We'll start talking. <br/>All of us start talking? <br/>Start talking, man. <br/>Start talking. What would you like to talk about? <br/>Start talking. <br/>I don't want to be involved in bitching and moaning and screaming. <br/>Certain people want to bitch and moan, though. <br/>But guy, that's all he [ no audio] does. <br/>Reacting like that, that's just...  Reacting like what? <br/>Just chill, for real. <br/>You have no idea how much I'm holding back, especially with Anthony, you know  what I mean? Sitting around dealing with somebody you really can't tell him how you feel  because you're worried about his vote. Right now I could care less about his vote. For some reason, Anthony, you consistently irritate the [ no audio] out of me  all the [ no audio] time. And I think you go out of your way to do it. I think you go out of your way to do it. I think, for some reason, for some strange reason, you play the sympathy case  once in a while that drives me nuts. I don't usually deal with people like that unless it's a broad-- no offense  to ladies, that's how I talk to girls-- unless it's a girl or it's my mother  or it's my crazy aunt. Everybody messes up, but when you whine about something or you get all, like...  you get all, like, sentimental and sensitive... you're a man. At least, the way I was raised, I'm a man, I've got to act like one. <br/>I'm sorry I irk you, and I'm sorry I irritate you. I have no idea what I'm doing to you that's irritating you. I've spent a lot of my life with very little self-esteem. You know, I got picked on as a kid, and I guess I developed a whole lot of  self-loathing. <br/>I got along with Jessica. I got along with Erica. Those two people are gone, and you're still here driving me absolutely insane. Both of those girls, better players than you. No offense. Some people have it, some people don't. <br/>I may not be doing the best in the challenges, but if they want me off this  island, they want me out of this game, they're going to have to push me off. Because there's no way in hell Because there's no way in hell I'm giving up. I'm giving up. <br/>Wow, I'm in Fiji. This is gorgeous. It's absolutely breathtaking. And at night with the moon is And at night with the moon is out... out...  Which makes our thing so perfect, you know? <br/>Right. Yeah. The five musketeers. <br/>From the beginning there has been a bond between Boo, Alex, Edgar, myself,  and Stacy. It's almost been unspoken. All we know is that the five of us get along and we're not stepping on each  other's toes. We all kind of come together. It's just amazing how things have just, like, fallen into place. <br/>The other team must be kicking their asses right now. <br/>That's the way the cookie crumbles. <br/>This water is awesome! I just want that cloud to go I just want that cloud to go away. away. away. <br/>So Gary...  So Gary...  So Gary...  Mm-hmm. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>I've done a lot of miserable things in my life. I mean, I did a tour of Vietnam and we had some crap that wasn't no fun  either. But gee whiz, this is just... the head spinning is just... I the head  spinning is just... I can't... you can't function. can't... you can't function. <br/>Everybody loves Gary in the tribe, and definitely want him to keep competing  if he feels good enough, but I think he should take his health first. At his age, the amount of stress and possibly high blood pressure... I want  him to feel better, first of all. <br/>You have so many bites, Gary. <br/>Mm-hmm. You've got thousands of them. Gary does not look good at all, and eventually it's going to turn into, like,  a babysitting situation. It's like, "Okay, you know, did I just have a baby and didn't realize  it?" Did you have some of that coconut meat? <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>You should have some, have plenty. I really don't want to take care of him. I don't want to babysit. So let's hope he gets better. That's the only thing I can say. If he doesn't get better he's If he doesn't get better he's going have to go. going have to go. going have to go. <br/>Probst: Moto, come on in! <br/>Probst: Moto, come on in! Ravu, come on in! Moto getting your first look at the new Ravu tribe. Sylvia voted out at the last tribal council. <br/>Whoa. <br/>Probst: You guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yep. <br/>Yeah, we are. <br/>Probst: For today's challenge, both tribes will line up side by side on a  very narrow balance beam over water. Moving one tribe member at a time, you must make your way across the beam,  stepping around your tribemates as you go. If you fall off, or if you are knocked off, you go back to the start. Once you get off the beam, onto the finish platform, then the next tribe  member goes. You can change your crossing order mid challenge, but you have to jump in the  water to do so. First tribe to get all their tribemates offof the beam, on to the finish  platform, win reward. Want to know what you're playing for? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: It's another big one. <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Probst: Whole lot of fish. <br/>Fish, yeah. <br/>Probst: Plenty of rice. Spices to liven up everything you eat. Plus some comfort-- pillows, blankets. That's not all. Waiting back at camp for the winning tribe, a king-sized bed with sheets and  pillows. In addition, the winning tribe will send one member from the losing tribe to  Exile Island. Moto, you have two extra members. Who are you going to sit out? <br/>Cassandra and Papa Smurf. <br/>Probst: Gary and Cassandra, sitting this one out. Swim out. Swim out. We'll get started. We'll get started. Once you guys are set, you cannot be holding onto each other. The only person you can touch is the person that's crossing you. The wind is starting to pick up. Perfect time to begin this challenge. Survivors ready? Go. Michelle for Ravu makes her way around Yau-Man. Stacy working around Lisi. <br/>Oh! <br/>Probst: Both going in. Michelle working Rita now. Stacy and Lisi are trying to get back up. Big reward on the line. Stacy tries a new approach. And that knocks Lisi off. There's a learning curve to this challenge. You will figure it out as you go along. Michelle making good progress. She's halfway through. Dreamz has a new idea. Your hands cannot touch the beam. Lisi steps over Stacy. Michelle hugging her way past Rocky. Lisi stepping over Alex. Both going in. Michelle easily sidesteps around Earl, the first tribe member across for Ravu. <br/>Lisi, let's go, baby, both of your hands on Alex. <br/>Probst: Moto going to stick with their strategy. Yau-Man now working around Rita. Gingerly, but it's effective. Lisi now going to have to sidestep a much taller guy, and she can't do it. she can't do it. Lisi back to the start. Lisi back to the start. Yau-Man crosses for Ravu. Ravu leads 2-0. Moto has a very precise strategy they're trying to work out. No, Lisi, you can't touch two people. One at a time, one at a time. Rita now working for Ravu. <br/>You can do it! You can do it! <br/>Probst: Lisi still trying to be the first member across for Moto. Rita and Anthony still working Rita and Anthony still working it. it. <br/>Use your hands and put your weight on him but make sure it's balanced. <br/>Probst: Lisi, one member left to get over. Lisi across for Moto. It's two-one. Anthony and Rita have been locked in an embrace for a long time. Anthony falls off, a lot of progress lost for Ravu. Moto's strategy is starting to work. Alex over Boo. Moto has tied at two-two. <br/>Come on, come on! <br/>Probst: Mookie and Anthony,  Probst: Mookie and Anthony, going to have to work together. going to have to work together. Mookie and Anthony both fall in. Stacy trying to figure out how Stacy trying to figure out how she's going to  get over Edgardo. she's going to get over Edgardo. Edgardo jumps in. All kinds of strategy coming into play. <br/>Everyone fall in. Everyone fall in! Earl, stay. Come on, come on! <br/>Probst: Ravu changing their entire lineup. Half the tribe jumps in to give the stronger people a better shot. But Anthony can't even stay up on the beam. <br/>[ groaning]  [ groaning]  [ cheers]  [ cheers]  Probst: Edgardo scores for Moto. We are three-two, Moto now in the lead. Ravu now using Moto's strategy. Mookie, you can only touch one at a time. Think. Get in the water. Liliana making it look easy. Moto leads four-two. Ravu still working. Dreamz is across. It is five-two. Stacy across for Moto. Boo gives a wave to the crowd. Boo gives a wave to the crowd. Moto wins reward! Moto wins reward! Ravu, once again, early lead, lost it in the end. Moto, still undefeated in challenges, and a big decision to make. Sending one person to Exile Island. They will return in time for the next immunity challenge. Who's it going to be? <br/>Yau-Man. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man going to Exile Island, where you will find another clue to  the whereabouts of the hidden whereabouts of the hidden immunity idol. immunity idol. Moto-- fish, rice, spices, and waiting back at camp, a king[1]sized  bed. Congratulations. Ravu, once again, got nothing for you. for you. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. <br/>Yeah! <br/>This is great! <br/>Look at the size of this fish! <br/>Today we once again kicked the crap out of Ravu, and in the process, won  ourselves a bed, which I am so excited about. <br/>Oh, my god. <br/>We can fit five people in here, man. <br/>Not only to we have comfort with the cushions and the blankets, but the fish  that we got, and the seasoning, I was like, "Oh, my gosh, I'm in  heaven."  Here, pull these spices off. <br/>Man, soy sauce! <br/>Paprika. <br/>I know. <br/>Okay, what you all got? <br/>Oregano. <br/>We're just living lovely right now. Our morale is up now more than ever. <br/>Geez, man, we're going to eat like kings today. <br/>Oh, man! <br/>Motolicious. <br/>I feel sorry for the individual members of the other tribe, but I want us to  continue winning. I... I don't want to let up for I... I don't want to let up for a second. a second. <br/>Absolutely ridiculous! Five in a row? Five in a row we lose? <br/>What do you want to do? Do you want to get together and talk about it, or...  Thank you! Why don't we just go to tribal council right now? You want to go to tribal council right now, we'll vote somebody off? Because that's all we do every week. Every other day we vote somebody off. So why don't we call Jeff up right now on the Jeff phone and go, "Hey,  Jeff, we're ready to vote somebody off today." I'm skinnier than  homeless people right now. I know 15 homeless people that are 40 pounds heavier than me. Are you serious? They're getting more nutrition in their diet. That's it right there. That was it. Food, pillows, a bed. Everything we complain about every day and we couldn't muster it up. Tell me why. <br/>We just lost. <br/>So what's the sense? What's the sense of going, "Oh, we'll get them next time, oh, we'll do  this next time"? No. I'm not sugarcoating nothing. <br/>We lost, it sucks, let's move on. I mean, if you go in somewhere thinking you're going to lose, your chances  are...  I'm not being negative. I'm stating the obvious. There's a difference. There's a difference. <br/>Who's going to get more wood? <br/>I like Rocky's spirit but it's not all about just talk. It's about motivating. Like, do something-- not just at challenges but here on this island. <br/>Argh! <br/>Argh! <br/>I'm starving! <br/>I'm starving! <br/>We have an interesting tribe. <br/>I'm hungry, I'm tired, I'm thirsty, but do I still get my ass up and go do  something? Yeah. But I'm telling you now, I can already feel this one. <br/>I already know how it's going to go. If we lose tomorrow, you know whose name's going down? It's going to be me. I know I have a big target on me, and I know that I have to be careful and  patient. But now that I've gotten a better grasp on who James is, I'll let him keep  talking, because really in the end it makes him look like an ass. If you don't like your bed, fix it. Chop down some palm fronds. I trust Anthony. I think he's a good guy, he's a genuine guy. But it's getting harder to look out for him. But I haven't made my exact move yet of what I'm going to do. yet of what I'm going to do. I'm still devising the plan. I'm still devising the plan. <br/>"Here you won't find the idol you crave. It's buried under the highest point of the big cave." I'm not resentful  at all of Moto for sending me here. In a way, I'm glad I get a chance to find the immunity idol. Highest point through which you enter. So it must be at the entrance. We may be sleeping on it. I'm quite sure I know where the idol is. The problem, of course, is when do I get the chance to dig alone? I need the immunity idol very badly, so I'll see how fast I badly, so I'll  see how fast I can dig. can dig. <br/>Whoa, whoa, whoa! [ laughter]  Liliana knows what she's doing, and sometimes guys aren't hip to the way  chicks maneuver. It's funny, because Liliana tries to be so sneaky, but I'm Latin, and knowing  my people the way that I do, I see what she's doing. I know in her little diabolical Mexican mind she's trying to come up with  something, you know? <br/>Oh, my god! [ laughter]  Wow! <br/>Wow! What in the world? What in the world? <br/>It just seems like the whole world is caving in here. I don't got the energy to do nothing. I just can't... I can't function. <br/>How you doing, big guy? Feeling nauseated? <br/>I ain't never had nothing like this before. I've had malaria ages ago, and that's nothing compared to what's going on. It just kind of scares you a little bit, you know? I just don't have... I just don't have...  Hi, Gary. <br/>Hi, Gary. <br/>I'm very worried for Papa Smurf, because I can see Papa Smurf was real hurt. Papa Smurf is one of the only people I talk to, so that's kind people I talk  to, so that's kind of worrying me. of worrying me. <br/>All right. <br/>I'm not so concerned about whether Gary stays in the game or not. Quite frankly, one less person, you know, means greater odds for you know,  means greater odds for all of us. all of us. <br/>Good-bye, Papa Smurf. <br/>Bye, Gary! <br/>Bye, Gary! <br/>Today was very frustrating, to be honest with you. We lost Gary, and... I don't know. I feel... I don't feel good about it. I don't feel good about today at all. <br/>Bye, Papa Smurf! <br/>Bye, Papa Smurf! <br/>Love you! <br/>I hope to god we don't lose the next immunity challenge tomorrow. But if we lose that immunity challenge, we're 7-7. In the eyes of the game, we're In the eyes of the game, we're tied, and then  we're screwed. tied, and then we're screwed. <br/>I'm going crazy, bro. I'm going crazy, bro. I just want to start winning. But all I can do is the best I can and try to get people fired up. I can lead by example. <br/>We've got tree mail! <br/>Are you guys ready? <br/>"Some of you are feeling trapped while others just hang around. The key to winning today's event on your teammates will be found. Whether you're on the bottom or if you're on the top, or if you're..."  don't, I don't want to look at you. <br/>Oh, dude. <br/>"...the pressure today will be intense. Tonight for one this game will stop."  I wasn't even watching. <br/>Well, thankfully, I only got like a half a second peek of James naked. Not a pretty sight. <br/>Wear one of the girls' shirts. <br/>Do you want my bikini top? <br/>I'm trying to make everybody laugh. I'm wearing a pink halter top with some coconuts in it. Feeling pretty good right now. <br/>That's hilarious, man. <br/>Anything to get the focus off losing five in a row, and hopefully just go out  there and hopefully just go out there and let it loose and win a game. let it loose and win a game. <br/>Probst: Ravu, come on in! Rocky, Pink is a good color for you. <br/>Thanks, Jeff. I was hoping you'd enjoy it. <br/>Probst: Ravu has a great attitude for having not won anything. No, that was a complement. <br/>Cool. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in Yau-Man returning from Exile Island. <br/>Whoo! <br/>I survived! Thank you. <br/>Probst: We'll now bring in  Probst: We'll now bring in Moto. Moto. <br/>Probst: Gary, Papa Smurf, was evacuated yesterday for medical reasons from  Moto's beach. <br/>Oh, wow! <br/>Probst: The update is Gary is officially out of the game, so Moto has lost  their first member. <br/>Oh, no! <br/>Probst: They are now down to eight. Despite losing Gary, the game continues. continues. I will take back immunity, Alex. I will take back immunity, Alex. Immunity is back up for grabs. Ready to get to today's immunity challenge? <br/>Do it. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Probst: Four tribe members will begin locked in floating cages. On my "go," another tribe member will head out with the key to  unlock the first tribe member from a cage. Once that person is free, they must then race across a series of lily pads to  free the second member from a locked cage. Once the fourth tribe member is free from their cage, that tribe member and  the rescuer get onto a boat where another tribe member is waiting with a ring  of keys. Together, you will paddle to shore, picking up your stranded tribemates as  you go. Once you're back to shore, you must then form a human pyramid. The person on top will use the ring of keys to unlock that last cage and free  your final tribe member. First tribe to get on their finish mat wins immunity. Make sense? <br/>Yep. <br/>Probst: There is one twist to today's challenge. Sealed inside this bottle is a note. The winning tribe will read this note after the challenge. Moto, you're going to have to sit one person out. Cannot sit out the same people in back-to-back challenges. Cassandra sat out last time. Who's it going to be this time? <br/>We're going to sit out Lisi. <br/>Probst: Lisi, have a spot on the bench. Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize and we'll minute to  strategize and we'll get started. get started. Here we go, for immunity. Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready? Survivors ready? Go! Edgardo with the early lead for Moto. <br/>Come on, Edgardo! <br/>Come on, Rocky. Go, Rocky. <br/>Edgardo to the cage first. <br/>There you go, there you go. Rocky loses his keys, falling behind. Dreamz is out. He's on the lily pads. Dreamz crawling across the lily pads. Rocky has Yau-Man out. <br/>Come on, Yau. Come on. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man takes on the lily pads. Dreamz working on the lock trying to get Alex free. Alex moving on for Moto. <br/>Come on, Yau. Come on, take your time. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man falling behind for Ravu. Yau-Man to the platform. He's got to get up. <br/>Good boy, Yau! Push! <br/>Probst: Moto now one full platform ahead. <br/>You got it, baby. You got it. <br/>Probst: Yau-Man losing his had glasses trying to work on the lot for Rita. <br/>Come on. <br/>Probst: Alex has Boo free! <br/>Rita now free. She's working on the lily pads. Barely hanging on. Moto with a big lead now. <br/>All right, all right, all right. <br/>Rita, push it, push it! <br/>Probst: Boo has Liliana free. They're getting on the boat. <br/>Go forward, forward, forward. forward. <br/>All right, guys paddle it! Paddle it! <br/>Dig, dig, dig. There you go. <br/>Probst: Rita losing a lot of time for Ravu. <br/>Get in! <br/>Oh, my god! <br/>Alex on the boat for Moto. <br/>Rita just now at the platform. Ravu has a lot of time to make up. <br/>Row, row, row, row! Ravu not quitting. <br/>Dig, dig, dig! <br/>Probst: Mookie making up a lot of time. <br/>Jump in, jump in, jump in! Dreamz now getting on the boat. <br/>All right, here. Come on. <br/>Earl now free. Ravu now in their boat. <br/>Get on! Get in the middle! Get in the boat. <br/>[ laughing]  Come on, Rita! <br/>Dig! Left side, dig. <br/>Dig, dig, dig, dig! <br/>Probst: Ravu, keep moving. Let's go! Moto heading into shore. <br/>Yeah! Yeah! <br/>Come on, Rocky! <br/>Probst: You're still in it, Ravu. Let's go! <br/>Probst: Moto starts to work on their human pyramid. That top person has got to stand. Ravu now back. Stacy working on the last lock. There are five keys. Stacy having trouble with the lock, trying key after key, hoping one will fit. Ravu working on their pyramid. Ravu back in it, if Michelle picks the right key. Immunity plus a twist to be Immunity plus a twist to be revealed on the line. revealed on the line. Stacy has to get down and open Stacy has to get down and open the cage. the cage. Moto wins immunity! Moto wins immunity! Still undefeated! Still undefeated! Moto, congratulations once again. <br/>Good job, guys! <br/>Probst: Now there's one more element to this challenge-- the bottle. As I said, the winning tribe would open the bottle and read the note. the note. Who wants it? Who wants it? <br/>"You have just won immunity. You must now decide which is more important to you, immunity or comfort. To keep your immunity, you must live at the Ravu tribe camp. <br/>Of course. <br/>To enjoy the food and comfort of the Moto camp, you must give up immunity and  vote someone out tonight."  Probst: So, interesting dilemma-- which is more important? You can keep your tribe strong at eight, switch camps, go live on Ravu's  beach. If comfort is more important, you can stay living where you are. You give immunity to Ravu, you go to tribal council and vote somebody out,  and suddenly we are even, 7-7. So all of a sudden, Gary's departure looming very large for this tribe. I'll give you a minute to talk it over. <br/>Who wants to keep the camp? Raise your hand. We're going to tribal council tonight. <br/>Jeff, we're keeping our comfort and going to tribal council. <br/>Probst: All right, Boo, go ahead and give immunity to Ravu. Ravu, for once, you won't be going to tribal council. Moto, you'll be going back to your camp with all the comforts. I'll see you at tribal. Grab your stuff, head on back to Grab your stuff, head on back to camp. camp. <br/>We won the challenge, and we had the option of giving up our home or vote  somebody off. So unfortunately, we're going to vote somebody off. And it's even uglier being that Gary left yesterday, so it's kind of like  we're losing two people. <br/>All right, let's sit down and talk for a second. This is what I feel is very important to me. I'm going... I'm not going to sugarcoat nothing. I think we are a tribe, right? We're honest, right? Are we snakes? Anybody here a snake? Not yet. We ain't snakes yet. And let's not turn into snakes yet. So with that being said and out of the way, there's two people we can afford  to lose now. I ain't pointing no fingers. It's Cassandra and Lisi. We can only afford to lose them, right? Am I right? If I'm not right, if anybody objects...  It depends on how you look it. <br/>I think that's are the only two people you can afford to lose. <br/>I'll be sincere. I'm not going to vote for Lisi. I like Lisi. Cassandra, I'm going to be straight with you. Probably my vote tonight will be against you. <br/>Here's the thing, Dreamz. I don't think you can ignore the interpersonal relationships that have been  built, not because it's a friendship, but it's also in thinking long-term,  that bond may help you in the future. <br/>We're not individuals yet. We're still a group. <br/>Dreamz started freaking out. I think he shoots from the hip a lot, and he's a bit naive. Because he has no clue what's going on. He thinks we're all part of this solid team, that we do things together in  stride. And it's not entirely untrue, it's just that the team consists of five  people-- myself, Alex, Ed, Lisi, and Boo. <br/>If anybody else got something  If anybody else got something to say, please. to say, please. So is that what we're going to So is that what we're going to do? do? <br/>Well we've got to decide something now before we start, "Come with me to  the water fountain real quick. Come with me to..." you know what I'm saying? That's when we turn to snakes and start biting each other. We don't have to eat each other yet. We don't have to do that yet. Let's not do it yet. <br/>I don't know, I don't know. <br/>I just want things to go down fair so we don't have to see the snake so early. snake so early. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Uh-huh. <br/>Like, it's not that we don't like you and we don't think you're a good  person, because I think you rock. <br/>No, I understand. <br/>The thing is, it would be a backward step for me to go against what they're  doing. I'm going to try to stay in this game longer. <br/>Yeah. All I'll say is just, you know, hang in there. It could be me going home this evening after tribal council. But I don't want to be the first voted out of my tribe. I didn't want to be the first voted out of the game. voted out of the game. So I'm holding on. So I'm holding on. <br/>I think Dreamz is better for us, so we need to keep Dreamz. us, so we need to keep Dreamz. <br/>We need to keep Dreamz, okay? <br/>We need to keep Dreamz, okay? <br/>I vote Liliana, too. <br/>Let's do it. <br/>Let's do it. She's going to be like... She's going to be like... As far as I'm concerned,  Liliana is the weakest link. Because our biggest concern is to get to the top five, and she's the one  person that could threaten it. She could try to manipulate things. She could say all sorts of things that could start tearing us apart. <br/>If we take out Liliana... Cassandra is bad at everything. She sucks at everything. <br/>It's not... we're not going to be hurting. I swear to you. <br/>The most logical thing is to keep Liliana, vote out Cassandra until we have a  numbers advantage again. Right now we're 7-7. Why on god's green earth would you vote out a woman who is as strong, almost  as any of the men? That to me seems absurd. <br/>One of them has got to go. <br/>I'm voting Liliana. <br/>Me, too. <br/>I'm very frustrated. I feel like this is illogical. I want to do what's best for our five-person alliance and for the team in  general. Liliana is a good person. She's worked hard at these challenges. She deserves to stay. She deserves to stay. Cassandra should go. Cassandra should go. <br/>Probst: Behind each of you is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch and approach the flame. Dip it in, get fire. This is part of the ritual of tribal council, because in this game, fire  represents life. As long as you have fire, you're still in the game. When your fire is gone, so are you. Boo, tell me about the loss of Gary. What was the reaction when he had to leave? <br/>Everyone, even the other tribe, loved Gary. He was sick for three days, and he stayed tough for our tribe. We miss him, and we can't wait to see him again. <br/>Probst: Dreamz, let's talk about friendship. Are you starting to bond with certain people maybe more than others? <br/>Pretty much Papa Smurf and Cassandra. But I'm not going to lie to you. The rest of them, if I talk they just get silent or they don't talk back. <br/>Probst: Edgardo, can you understand what Dreamz is saying? <br/>I really don't know where he's coming from. I think we all, you know, treat each other the same way. You know, I treat Liliana the same way I treat Dreamz or Boo. But if he feels that way, I'm going to make sure he doesn't feel that way  anymore. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about today's challenge. Lisi, in spite of the fact that you won, you have to come to tribal council. So what happens at camp? <br/>As a matter of fact, Dreamz goes on a soliloquy about how, you know, some  people should be voted off, the weakest ones...  Jeff...  Cassandra and Lisi. So he's talking about being indivisible, but he's pointing fingers. Hello! <br/>Probst: So, Dreamz, you come back to camp and you decide, "Let's just  have a powwow and I'm going tell you how it is."  Well, not like that, Jeff. Don't make me sound like a monster. <br/>Probst: I'm asking! <br/>All right. I was just saying, "Stop me if I'm wrong, if y'all think I'm wrong at  any point in time." Nobody stopped me, Jeff. They let me go on a shaquila, or whatever she called it. <br/>Probst: Soliloquy. <br/>She let me go on a soliloquy, or whatever they call it. I didn't want to eat each other yet, you know what I'm saying? I didn't want people to go off into little groups and start talking about  people. <br/>Probst: So Alex, you didn't lose, but you're here. You don't want to vote somebody out, but you have to. What do you base it on? <br/>I think you base it on what's going to be best for the tribe moving forward,  and we're going to just move on and do whatever it takes to make sure that  Ravu doesn't have another opportunity to have one of our members voted out. <br/>Probst: Liliana, what do you bring to this tribe? <br/>I feel that I bring strength, and I try to get with the guys and say,  "Let's go fishing or hunting or climbing." So helping the guys out  is not a problem for me. That's just the way I am at home, and I'm here being the same person. <br/>Probst: Cassandra. <br/>I definitely want to compliment Liliana. She's exemplary for the female strength. She's just amazing. I just look for her to go very far in the game. Love you. <br/>Love you, too. <br/>Probst: All right, it is time to vote. to vote. Alex, you're up. Alex, you're up. <br/>I'm going to really miss you. You're such a great person. I really did see the strength in I really did see the strength in you. you. <br/>The alliance is five, not  The alliance is five, not six. six. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area  immediately. I'll read the votes. I'll read the votes. First vote, Liliana. First vote, Liliana. Lisi. Lisi. One vote Liliana, one vote Lisi. One vote Liliana, one vote Lisi. Cassandra. That's one vote each for Liliana, Lisi, and Cassandra. Liliana. Liliana. Two votes Liliana. Two votes Liliana. Liliana. That's three votes Liliana, one vote Lisi, one vote Cassandra. Fourth person voted out of Survivor: Fiji,Liliana. <br/>Wow. <br/>Probst: That's four. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>I'm so shocked. <br/>I'm so shocked. So shocked. So shocked. If they didn't get me out now, I was going to beat them. <br/>Probst: Liliana, the tribe  Probst: Liliana, the tribe has spoken. has spoken. <br/>Probst: Well, I think Liliana's expression said it all. This game definitely being played within the Moto tribe. Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Head back to camp. Good night. Good night. <br/>Probst: stay tuned for scenes  Probst: stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor:  Those two are two sour apples. <br/>Probst: Moto begins to  Probst: Moto begins to fracture. fracture. <br/>Probst: The hunt for the idol is on. <br/>I got a chance to dig. I don't know for how long. <br/>Laugh it up. <br/>Why don't me and you go up there right now? <br/>We could. <br/>Let's do that then. Keep running your mouth. Bring it. <br/>Probst: And the gloves come  Probst: And the gloves come off. off. <br/>Well, I'm definitely 100% shocked. To me, it's ridiculous to get rid of one of your stronger people in the  beginning. I just wish I could have stayed in longer, because I definitely would have  kicked some butt. Wow, there are some good liars, great liars. I think the weak link stayed behind and not... the strong behind and not...  the strong one's leaving today.
