<br/>Jeff Probst: Previously on Survivor:  Everything I say you have some snotty remark! <br/>Probst: Caryn and Katie went head-to-head. <br/>Get off me! <br/>She's crazy. She's completely lost it. <br/>Probst: Survivors ready. At the reward challenge... Go! ...as the tribes faced off in hand-to-hand combat, Koror took a  beating... Angie dunks Gregg! ...and Ulong dunked their way to victory... Ulong wins reward! ...winning material and a sewing kit. <br/>Ulong! <br/>Probst: Back at Ulong, although morale was up...  That was so awesome. <br/>We totally kicked their ass. <br/>Probst: ...Bobby Jon grew frustrated. <br/>I'm very disappointed with my tribe right now. <br/>Oh, so close. <br/>Especially Kim. I don't think she understands the value of work. <br/>Probst: At Koror...  It's definitely a sea krait, so be careful. <br/>Probst: ...the tribe tangled with some deadly creatures. <br/>That thing right there. It's coming closer. This is probably the stupidest thing I've done in a while. <br/>It's a game of survival and we're going to get a shark. <br/>Okay, here comes one. <br/>Probst: Before the immunity challenge, Ulong faced a  setback when Jeff sprained his ankle. <br/>It's totally my luck. I hurt my ankle and we have a challenge the very next morning. If I mess up today, it's on my shoulders. <br/>Probst: Go! Right away, Jeff's unclipping. Jeff took no chances and bailed out of the challenge, but after  a long test of strength and endurance, it was Koror who pulled through. Koror wins their third immunity challenge in a row. <br/>Whoo! <br/>Probst: Back at camp, Jeff gathered his tribe. I know there's no possible way that I can get to the end with a  busted-up ankle. If I stay in here, you guys aren't going to get to the end. <br/>Probst: Some were not convinced. <br/>I feel very strongly that Jeff should stay. We should get rid of Kim for sure. <br/>Probst: But at Tribal Council, Kim was spared when the  tribe honored Jeff's wishes and voted him out. Jeff, the tribe has spoken. 15 are left. 15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight? Who will be voted out tonight? <br/>I can't believe this is all that's left. We started out with, We started out with, like, so many people. like, so many people. <br/>I know. <br/>Tonight at Tribal Council, Jeff went home. I am very sad he's not here. He's great for the team. He's a great friend. It absolutely is horrible to lose the strongest player on your  tribe, but that's what he had wanted, and so that's what we did. <br/>Koror is using strategy when it comes to the immunity  challenge. <br/>Yeah, but they're a weak-ass team. There's obviously something going wrong because they're not in  shape and they're kicking our asses. <br/>We're not going to Tribal again. You guys understand me? I'm going to stomp I'm going to stomp anybody's ass that lags. anybody's ass that lags. You know what I mean. <br/>He means it in a good way, though. <br/>I don't know. This tribe right now doesn't have a lot of togetherness. and closeness, like we thought we had. As it's built right now, everybody's self-esteem's getting down,  but I'm hoping we're going to turn it around. I hope we do learn something, but right now, I don't think but  right now, I don't think we have. we have. <br/>Tree mail. Uh...  I knew it. <br/>"Today you must choose one and only one tribal  representative to make some important choices. The tribe will then have to live with those  decisions."  Katie and I went to go get tree mail this morning and it  basically says the we need to send a tribal representative out, and that we  have to live with the decisions that we make. <br/>We need to figure out what it is. It could be a person swap. <br/>Yeah, or what if the person goes doesn't get to come back? goes doesn't get to come back? <br/>I think Gregg should go. <br/>I think Gregg should go. <br/>I'm not crazy about it, but I'm not opposed to it. <br/>Everyone else is up for it? <br/>I am. <br/>I would definitely be willing to go. <br/>I would do it. <br/>I would do it. <br/>I'll speak right out on that and do a vote. Ian, you've made many good decisions, you've been the team  leader here. You want to go? I say you go. <br/>Yeah, he'd be good. <br/>Today we were volunteering on who wanted to go, me, Caryn  and Janu all volunteered. But it's like nobody listened to us. They just said, "So, should it be Gregg or should be it  Ian?" "I want to go." "Well, should it be Gregg or should  it be Ian?" "I want to go," I just kept repeating myself. <br/>I just don't want to lose you. <br/>I'll be back. We'll see each other again. Is that cool? <br/>It's definitely the tribe's vote. Everybody seems to go for Ian. I'm not going to fight for it. By picking the team leader, the separation of the group is just  obvious. Katie, Jennifer, Gregg, Ian and Tom are one unit, so that makes  five against four. Once we saw them all band together, it was obvious that we're  definitely the we're definitely the underdogs here. underdogs here. <br/>"Today you must choose one and only one."  So somebody is going to be the top dog here. We represent you. <br/>Hey, we're picking out of a hat. <br/>How do you feel about doing it, Kim? <br/>I'm fine with it. I think you're good at it, too, though. <br/>Maybe we'll draw straws or something. <br/>I don't know. I don't agree with the drawing straws. It seems like nobody likes to sit down and think about it for a  second. It's very impulsive, and I'm sure that it won't be the best  decision once it's made. <br/>Want to see what the challenge is and then go from there? <br/>Yeah. We have to go fishing right now. Let's go. <br/>Yeah, let's do that. <br/>Yeah, let's do that. <br/>Let's go fishing. <br/>Let's go fishing. <br/>There's a boat coming. <br/>This is like some kind of World War II thing. <br/>It's on its way. <br/>Oh, look at it. <br/>Probst: What's going on, Koror? Koror? <br/>Hey. <br/>Hey. <br/>Probst: Who's the representative? <br/>Ian. <br/>Probst: Ian, come on up. <br/>Bye, Ian. <br/>See you guys. <br/>Probst: All right, Ian, for today's reward challenge, your  tribe is going to build a bathroom, two sections: a toilet area and a shower  and a wash area. To help you build your bathroom, we go to the Home Depot we go  to the Home Depot toolshed. toolshed. [all exclaiming]  Oh, my God. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Who'd have thought I'd be that excited to see tools? <br/>Probst: A few items. You have a bush shower, a shower curtain, some rings, toilet  seat, some twine, wire, rope, lots of nails, right? <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: In addition, timber, and you get to pick six tools  from the toolshed-- six tools that you will build your bathroom with and six  tools you will keep for the remainder of your time out here. <br/>Jeff gave me the choice to pick six tools out of his toolbox. It was a difficult decision. But my dad owns a construction company and I grew up on a farm,  so it worked out okay. <br/>Probst: What's the last item going to be? <br/>It's going to be this one. <br/>Probst: All right, you have one more decision. <br/>Mm-hmm. <br/>Probst: Koror now has three extra members. You're sitting three people out. They cannot participate in the planning or the execution of this  challenge. Keep in mind, Ian, you cannot sit the same people out in  back-to-back challenges. <br/>Oh, that's right. Okay, we have a immunity challenge coming up, too. Okay, so we're going to sit out Jen, Coby, Janu. <br/>Probst: Okay. Tomorrow morning, I'm going to come back with a judge. The person doing the judging is Jesse. He's got a degree in Construction Management. He's been with the show since day one, and his team builds all  the challenges out here. He knows what's possible to be built out here. For the winning tribe, Jesse will come back with our entire  construction department, and they will build a shelter the likes of which has  never been seen. <br/>Oh, my God. <br/>Probst: Worth doing? <br/>Absolutely. <br/>Probst: All right. Get somebody to come help you get all of your tools and get to  work. <br/>Nice job, Ian. <br/>Are we okay? Yeah? As far as my choices go, I hope the tribe's happy with it, but  I'm feeling fantastic, but I'm feeling fantastic, the adrenaline's running. the adrenaline's running. <br/>Good job, James. Bigger than what we've been getting. been getting. <br/>We found Nemo. <br/>We found Nemo. <br/>Probst: Ulong, come on in. Good to see you guys out here fishing. <br/>We're trying. <br/>We try. We try. <br/>Probst: All right, so, the reason I'm out here-- who's  your representative? <br/>Can we ask questions or no? <br/>Can we ask you questions? <br/>Probst: You have not picked a representative yet? You guys don't have a leader. You can't even pick a representative. Give me somebody. <br/>James. <br/>James. <br/>James. <br/>Probst: James, get up here on the barge. <br/>You okay with that? <br/>All right. <br/>All right. <br/>Probst: James is worried. <br/>I wasn't trying to be the leader. They picked me, but luckily they did pick me because if they  didn't we wouldn't have got the tools we needed to build our lavatory. My stuff. I used to build houses. <br/>Probst: So you've got a background in construction. <br/>I got a background. This is hatchet with a hammer on one end, hatchet on the other. <br/>Good choice, James. <br/>Probst: Okay, here's what's what's going to happen. Some of the guys from the construction department are going to  build, for the winning tribe, the most kick-ass Survivor shelter ever. <br/>Oh, really? <br/>Probst: Sound good? <br/>Hell yeah. Leadership is not a role I want to take on, but when a reward  challenge is at stake, somebody's got to step up and say, "Hey, get up  off your asses "Hey, get up off your asses and let's get to work."  and let's get to work."  The Koror construction crew is in high gear. We have a plan now, so we're gonna pull all the stops out. Koror is going nuts with this thing. <br/>Nice. <br/>Got a nice pathway going. <br/>Willard, we couldn't have planned it better ourselves. Look at that notch-- my God! <br/>If you watch Tom and Ian, they are very careful not to go  through the day without saying, in front of the group, something good about  everybody in the group. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I am carving "Watch your step" to put before the  walkway to the latrine. <br/>That's great. <br/>Time for lunch and a team meeting. <br/>Tom is a leader. That's what he does for a living. He's an officer in the fire department. He's highly motivated. He works hard. He's our little motor that He's our little motor that makes the  train run. makes the train run. <br/>Here we go. <br/>Here we go. Add water. Add water. <br/>Every leader for every project is always Tom. That's the way it is in this tribe. Everyone is "Oh, Tom, oh, Tom. Yes, Tom." The women won't even throw a stick in the fire  without, "Tom, Tom, can I throw a stick in the fire, Tom?" in the  fire, Tom?" It's a little crazy. It's a little crazy. <br/>Now, I'm taking a shower and I want a little bit of elbow  room, you know, so... 35 inches right here. Mark it. Big arrow. Being the boss, it's a big responsibility, but I'm feeling  pretty good that I can take some skills that I've learned and build us a  little outhouse, so we can win us a shelter. So measure from right there, down there. <br/>You look real funny right now. <br/>I do, don't I? <br/>It's about 22. <br/>22 sounds good. <br/>What if we laid them this way because this is going to not  be real sturdy? <br/>Oh, honey. <br/>What? <br/>We've got to nail it. <br/>Yeah, I know. <br/>It's going to be a frame. I promise, it'll be sturdy. Turn that back. <br/>Sorry. <br/>I'm happy to have James as a team leader, but he can be  very fatherly, which can be annoying at times. Okay. <br/>Okay, now... Press, you understand? <br/>Yeah, yeah. <br/>I use a staple gun every day at my job. It makes me mad that James is, like, "Oh, do you need help  with that nail?" Because I know what I'm doing. When I have something broken at my house I fix it. at my house I fix it. Landlord don't fix it, I fix it. Landlord don't fix it, I fix it. <br/>What's wrong? <br/>I'm really weak. Like I need food. And I know you guys need food, but it seems you guys can go  better than I can without it. Like I'm so dizzy I could pass out right now. <br/>What do you want to do? <br/>I don't know. <br/>Why don't you start taking that shower curtain and sew on  "Ulong."  Kim's a little bit useless. She's always trying to get out of things. Finally we found something she likes to do, which is sew. Something she can sit on her ass, and... But really, we've got  five people doing all the hard work. Hey, Bobby Jon, I need some Hey, Bobby Jon, I need some trees  about that big around. trees about that big around. <br/>When I started working hard on something, my whole body  and soul just goes into it, every ounce of it. You've got to want it, you've got to want it and that's what  winners do, winners keep fighting. winners keep fighting. Champions keep persevering. Champions keep persevering. Champions keep persevering. [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting]  It sucks to be on a team with completely "gung-ho,  I'll work until I die and bleed to death" type of people. <br/>It's jammed. <br/>Don't point that towards your eyeball. You want the honest truth? I think I'm the smart one sitting in the center of a bunch of  people running around with their heads chopped off. What are we doing about the sink? We need to get cracking. We've got a lot of time now. Let me tell y'all something, that's why construction jobs don't  get done on time, because people freak out. Don't freak out. <br/>James, he's going to end up driving people insane and I'm  slowly watching everybody mentally lose it, so I'm kind of stepping back and  letting the beast attack the beast. <br/>Who wants to sit on the potty? We've got time for y'all to try it out. Get your asses over here. Get your asses over here. Quit your whining. Quit your whining. <br/>Yes, the boat's coming. <br/>Let's fall in, guys. <br/>Probst: Are you ready for us? <br/>Yeah. We're more than ready, Jeff. More than ready. <br/>Probst: Koror, this is Jesse. <br/>How you doing. Welcome to Camp Koror. <br/>Probst: Jesse's our production designer. He's a tough judge. <br/>We're a tough tribe. We're okay. <br/>Probst: Good. Let's go. Show us. <br/>Tom, lead the way. <br/>This morning Jesse and Jeff Probst came to do the judging  so it was very nerve-wracking. <br/>We have the path coming down, it diverges. We have a little sign here-- "Watch your step." We'll  take you over to the latrine first, show you what we've got there. <br/>Probst: Tom, you're a great tour guide. <br/>He is; he is. <br/>I'll tell you a little bit about some of the design  features-- we decided not to enclose the walls. <br/>Pretty good. <br/>You can shake it. <br/>Yeah, we notched out the boards. <br/>Got a newspaper? <br/>We do have toilet paper. You'll notice that we have...  It's not the stinging tree, is it? <br/>No, it's not. <br/>The tour was terrific. It was taking them through our thought process, how we worked  and how we came up with what we came up with. I'm very confident. I'd be surprised if we didn't win and we need this. We have Rat City, USA. And we need a shelter. <br/>Yeah, let's have a look at the shower. All right. I like the path, a nice touch. <br/>We mounted the actual shower above the tree, and you're  able to adjust it to whatever size you want to go. You want a demonstration? <br/>Yeah. <br/>I think I'm the dirtiest kid  I think I'm the dirtiest kid in camp, so... in camp, so...  Hand me the soap, will ya? <br/>Probst: You got everything you need? <br/>Yeah, I think I'm pretty good. That's good. Thanks very much. <br/>No problem. <br/>Probst: So here's the deal, guys: Jesse's is going to  judge you based on creativity and functionality. If he decides that your bathroom is the best... you'll know it. We'll return. Fair enough? <br/>Fair enough. Thank you. <br/>Probst: See you guys. <br/>Might see you guys soon. <br/>I think we put everything that we had into this challenge,  more so than any other challenge. If I'm judging facial expression, I think Jesse was very  impressed. I don't think there's any way I don't think there's any way we  can lose this one. we can lose this one. <br/>Ulong. <br/>Here he comes. <br/>Uh-oh. Hurry. They didn't even see it. <br/>They didn't even see it. <br/>Hurry, hurry. They're right here now. <br/>That's it-- stop. <br/>Right here. <br/>Put the shovel up. Put the shovel up. <br/>Probst: Looks like you guys are still working. This is Jesse Jensen-- he's the guy I told you about. You want to give him a tour or you want him just to look around? James is going to do that. <br/>You ready for a tour, buddy? <br/>I'm ready for a tour. "For a good time call Jeff Probst." [all  laughing]  Probst: I hope you got the right number down. <br/>Yeah. <br/>We've got our wash basins, we've got a vase, got a  toothbrush holder. <br/>Those your toothbrushes? <br/>Yes. I haven't used it yet, but they have. I don't brush my teeth because I'm a redneck. <br/>You tend to bite down. <br/>We've got our shower right here and we have a drain. <br/>Nice. <br/>Surprisingly, our bathroom area and everything looks  really good. It's a lot nicer than we thought it would ever be. <br/>Let's have a look around the back. <br/>All these posts can be dug up. <br/>We figured it didn't matter if you saw through here,  because you're washing your hands. <br/>Probst: Seen enough? <br/>Yeah, I've seen enough. Yeah. <br/>Probst: All right, so here's how it'll work, guys: If  Jesse decides your bathroom is the best bathroom we will return with our  construction crew. If we're not here by sundown, pretty good idea we're not coming  back. <br/>Fair enough. <br/>Thanks, everybody. <br/>Thanks for the tour. <br/>Thanks for the tour. <br/>Probst: See you later. <br/>Probst: See you later. <br/>Good job, James. Really good job. <br/>You did it. <br/>You did so good. <br/>Everybody did it. I think we won, no doubt. Look at it. It's perfect. They'll be back in about... They'll be back in about... I  estimate two, three hours. I estimate two, three hours. <br/>How long do we have to wait? <br/>I think like an hour, hour-and-a-half. <br/>If nothing else works out, we have a shower and a toilet. Good effort. The Koror construction crew did a fantastic job on this  challenge, so we're really proud. But you never know what rabbit Ulong is going to pull rabbit  Ulong is going to pull out of their hat. out of their hat. <br/>Is that a boat coming? <br/>I hear something. <br/>A boat. <br/>Oh, yeah. It looks like a Home Depot boat. <br/>Yeah! [cheering] Yeah! <br/>All right! Yeah, bring it! <br/>Oh, my g...  Yeah! Yes! <br/>Come on, cartwheels down the beach! [cheering] The barge boat came around the corner again. We could see the Home Depot sign on it, and there was a lot of,  lot of joy in camp. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Yeah. <br/>Yeah, we're going to sleep good tonight. <br/>We totally deserve this. <br/>Bring it home. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I knew it. <br/>I knew it. <br/>Yes! <br/>Yes! <br/>They'll be back. <br/>I don't know, man. I'm kind of thinking that we may have lost. Still trying to keep hope up because the sun hasn't set all the  way. It's not dark yet, It's not dark yet, but it's looking kind of  grim. but it's looking kind of grim. but it's looking kind of grim. [hammer pounding, saw buzzing] [hammer pounding, saw buzzing]  Instead, we get a construction crew. Like, come on. We have a new shelter going on, so, uh... so a good day for  Koror, for sure. Everything worked out the way it's supposed to. Oh, it's a frickin' palace. It's like the Taj Mahal. It's fantastic. Gosh, thank you so much. <br/>No problem. You're welcome. You're welcome. <br/>It's fantastic. <br/>It's fantastic. <br/>I can't even begin to explain how great our shelter is--  it's beautiful. It's not even a shelter, it's a home. We've got a hammock in there and a lantern, and they built us a  picnic table and, like, a little platform for us to just hang out on. It makes the quality of life here so much better. <br/>We got something else here for you, a little housewarming. <br/>Oh...! <br/>What is it? [cheering]  Yeah! Yeah! <br/>To you guys, thank you. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Oh, this feels so good. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Thanks a lot, guys. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. <br/>As if the shelter wasn't enough, these wonderful people  turned around and gave us a housewarming gift, and it was a crate with two  bottles of ice-cold champagne in it. We don't even know if it was the alcohol, but it was the most  delicious thing you ever tasted and it felt great. I'm not that light yet. [giggling]  Caryn? <br/>Caryn? [cackling] [cackling]  I guess the other team won. <br/>I don't get it. Damn. <br/>Probably just because they haven't won one yet. <br/>No. That's B.S. <br/>Yeah, it is. It seems that we lost the challenge. I was confident that we had it, you know? We worked hard. It looks good. It's a shame. But that's all right, 'cause it just makes us more angry that we  lost. We're ticked off, so we're going after them and we're going to  run right them like a dang bulldozer. They won the first three times, it was their time. it was their time. It's our time now. It's our time now. <br/>Yo! <br/>Yo! We got tree mail. We got tree mail. <br/>Oh, my God, it's a gladiator thing. We're going to have to hit each other off beams. <br/>That's what I'm thinking. <br/>"Square off in a circle against your opponents. Balance and strength: two crucial components. David beat Goliath using brains over brawn. Be the one to lose this one, you could be the next gone."  We're going to all have to take on one person with that. <br/>Oh, yeah, that's what it's going to be. <br/>I'm going to practice a little bit. I hate for things to come down to the wire, but it seems like it  has with us. I mean, this next immunity can make or break us. If we don't get it, we're down to five and they have nine. We can't lose another tribe member. <br/>We're going to be like wolverines. <br/>All I know to do to win this next immunity challenge is  just to fight, fight, fight, fight, fight. That's all I know to do. You've got to block out the past You've got to block out the  past and worry about right now. and worry about right now. and worry about right now. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. <br/>Probst: Come on in, guys. Guys ready to get to today's challenge? <br/>Yes. <br/>Yes, sir. <br/>Yeah. <br/>Probst: First things first. <br/>Probst: First things first. Katie... Katie... Immunity back up for grabs. For today's immunity challenge, tribe members will engage  one-on-one in a sumo-style battle on a platform. Using large padded bags, you will attempt to knock your opponent  off the platform. Two rules-- you got to keep two hands on the bag at all times. You cannot use your feet as a weapon. First tribe to six wins immunity. Koror, because you have three extra members, you're sitting  three people out. And because this is men versus men, women versus women, you have  to sit out two men and one woman to even up the tribes. Who's sitting out? <br/>I am. <br/>Probst: Ian, Katie, Willard, sit out. Everybody else runs. Take your spots. Wait for my go. All right, first round, man versus man-- it is Tom for Koror and  Bobby Jon for Ulong. <br/>Here we go, Bobby. <br/>Come on, Tom. <br/>Probst: Survivors ready. Go!

Angie wasting no time. Caryn's in! Ulong has battled back, five-five tie! <br/>We're not going back to immunity! <br/>Probst: Angie's so excited, Tribal Council! Angie's so excited, she doesn't know what to say. <br/>Take that and see how it  Take that and see how it feels! feels! <br/>Probst: It comes down to this. We are tied at five-five.

James comes on strong out of the gate. Coby fighting back. Using that height. <br/>Come on, Coby! <br/>Probst: That reach has got James going backwards. He's got James down. <br/>Coby, yeah! <br/>Probst: Pushing him. James fighting back, squirreling around. Coby still on it. James recovers; now he's got Coby down. <br/>Go, Coby, go! <br/>Probst: Coby still pushing. James on the edge. <br/>Get him, James! Come on, James! [indistinct shouting]  Come on, James! <br/>Probst: Coby trying to push him over with his shoulder! And he's got him! James is in! Koror wins their fourth straight immunity challenge! [whoops] [whoops] [yells] [yells] Koror. For the fourth time. No Tribal Council tonight. Nobody going home for this tribe-- staying strong at nine. Ulong-- nothing to say. Four straight visits to Tribal Council. This tribe of six will become five tonight. five tonight. Head on back to camp. Head on back to camp. <br/>I thought we would have it today. <br/>Me, too. <br/>I didn't know Coby was that  I didn't know Coby was that much stronger than James. much stronger than James. <br/>Feels terrible to have my butt whooped by a homosexual,  you know, but a lot of gay folks are strong, man. They all working out at the gym and all, you know. gym and all, you know. Damn. Damn. <br/>We got our butts kicked today. Imagine that. That's what's been happening here lately. I personally got my butt whipped, and now we got to go to  Council tonight and we got to vote somebody off. <br/>I am so sick of losing, I don't know what to do. I've never lost this bad my entire life. I'm about to flip out. When we got back from the challenge, I was so mad and upset and  embarrassed and just pissed because James lost it for all of us. We could have won immunity, and there it was out of our hands  again, four in a row. We lost. I'm friggin' embarrassed. <br/>Yeah. <br/>I'm mortified. <br/>Well, at least we know that we're doing our part. <br/>Right. <br/>We didn't fall off. <br/>Angie and I, we did the best we could do. We won both our heats, so thank God for the women, 'cause the  guys, they're getting their butts handed to them. <br/>Hey, Kim. <br/>What? <br/>Tonight, we ain't playing the game. We ain't even going to talk about it. We're just gonna go write a name down, you know. We all know whose name's going down. <br/>I'm laying right here in the shade. <br/>Kim, she sits on her butt, but that's it, you know. She don't do nothing. She might drink some coconut juice, you know. That's about the most work she will do, you know. Come on. So she's gone. <br/>James told me, don't talk about your vote. Like, if anybody else had said it, it would have been fine, but  ever since then, it just makes me cry. <br/>If you get voted off, it's going to be three guys versus  two girls. And they're just going to vote the girls off, one-by-one. Kim, she knows she can be the next one to go. Everybody is completely fed up with her. But if we vote Kim out, and three guys and two girls, Angie and  I are in big trouble. I don't even know what to do. <br/>Kick all the guys off. I think the girls definitely see the value of us sticking  together, and I would more than be willing to see some of these guys go  because they aren't guys go because they aren't the greatest. the greatest. <br/>It's a slam dunk for me, man. Kim, I just think she's not a very strong girl, so I just think  it's smarter to vote off the weakest link. Way to go, man. <br/>They're just going to totally take us out. <br/>Yeah. <br/>So what are we going to do? <br/>Well, I just feel like we need to take control. <br/>Me and Steph are definitely talking about trying to vote  trying to vote one of the guys out instead of Kim. We'd have the upper hand, but then again, we might just lose  another immunity challenge because she's not pulling her weight, so what's  the lesser of two evils? Trying to keep somebody around and hope you may not get voted  off, but if she helps us lose it, then-- pfft!-- you know, somebody's going  anyways. <br/>The tide's never up this high-- what the hell? <br/>It could go either way. I could go or one of the guys could go because this is a group  that actually won't make final decisions till it's time to pick up that pen  and write to pick up that pen and write down the name. down the name. <br/>Probst: I saved your seats for you from last time. <br/>Appreciate it. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about some of the facts. Seven challenges, you've lost five of them. Steph, how frustrating is it for you to continue to get beat? <br/>It's so frustrating. I feel like I've never lost this much in my life. Like, I don't know whether to scream, flip out, cry... I mean, I  feel like we are giving it our best and it's not enough. Or at least I know I am and it's, it's killing me. <br/>Probst: Angie? <br/>I was really, really upset we didn't win that reward  challenge for that shelter, and then, on top of it, to lose, like, you know,  the next immunity challenge. Oh, man, it's just devastating. <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon, I don't think we've ever had a tribe  lose this many in a row. <br/>Right. Yeah, things aren't good. Yeah, we're, we're bad. Right now, we're down. Obviously, you know what? I'm not doing something right, and I mean, I consider my head  being on the chopping block, if you want to know the truth, 'cause I have let  our tribe down in the challenges, and I know I have and there's no excuse for  that, bottom line. <br/>Probst: Okay, tonight, we're going to talk about  accountability. It is time to get to the bottom of what is wrong with this  tribe, starting with camp life. Kim. Is there one person that goes fishing? Two people? Does everybody do it? <br/>We all go out, but it seems that Bobby Jon and James take  the Hawaiian sling the most and go. <br/>Probst: When's the last time you went fishing? <br/>We all go out together. We don't go into the water and fish. <br/>Probst: So what are you doing? <br/>We sit on the boat. <br/>Probst: Well, how useful is that? <br/>I mean, Stephenie and I couldn't just row out there all  the way into the deep blue and go fishing and turn around and row back in. I mean, you might have to send a search team out. <br/>Probst: Steph, if you had no men in this tribe, could you  guys survive? Are you self-sufficient as women or are you relying on these  guys? <br/>I think we rely on them, but I think we could be  self-sufficient if we had to be. <br/>I'm not sure if the guys think that us women are as wieldy  with things like the machete and axes and the spear. Like, when we were working on our reward challenge, people were  trying to help me nail-- now, I nail a lot at home, okay? I know how to hammer a nail, it's not hard. But the guys think we're a little bit more delicate than we  really are. <br/>Probst: Bobby Jon. Is that fair to say? <br/>You know, I've only been out here 11 days, and I've  learned that these women right here are just as strong or more stronger than  men. If Kim can use that sling and go and kill us a bear, I mean, I  want her to. <br/>Probst: Let's talk about today's challenge. James. Frustrating to lose to Coby? <br/>No doubt. I'm thinking, "Man, he's a hairdresser. He don't look like he's got any muscle tone, I ought to be able  to whoop him." I tell you what, that boy right there has got some ass  behind him. <br/>Probst: Well, of course you're going to say that...  Whooped my ass! Yeah! <br/>Probst: Today it took six points to win. Five of their six points came from beating the men. The women carried this tribe again. <br/>Yes, they did. <br/>Probst: Kim, today you may have lost, but as a whole, the  women...  Were stronger. <br/>Probst: The women kept you guys in the challenge today. <br/>Yeah, definitely. If we had had stronger guys with a burning passion and control  with that passion we would not be here right now. <br/>Probst: Okay, it is time to vote. vote. Ibrehem, you're up. Ibrehem, you're up. <br/>Kim, you're a good girl, but you're just not putting much  effort into the tribe lately. effort into the tribe lately. Sorry. Sorry. <br/>My vote is for James. James, just wary of dictating James, just wary of dictating a  little too much. a little too much. <br/>Probst: I'll go tally the  Probst: I'll go tally the votes. votes. <br/>Probst: Once the votes are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council  area immediately. I'll read the votes. First vote. Kim. James. James. One vote Kim, one vote James. One vote Kim, one vote James. Kim. Two votes Kim. One vote James. Kim. That's three votes Kim. Fourth person voted out of Survivor: Palau-- Kim. That's four. That's enough. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Good luck, guys. <br/>Bye, Kim. <br/>Probst: Kim, the tribe has spoken. spoken. It's time for you to go. It's time for you to go. After a demoralizing first 11 days, the question is, what are  you going to do to change the outcome? Grab your torches, head back Grab your torches, head back to  camp. to camp. <br/>Probst: Stay tuned for scenes  Probst: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. from our next episode. <br/>Probst: Next time on Survivor... While Gregg and Jen get  cozy at Koror...  They're gonna think we're stupid if we can't tell that  they're together. <br/>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. <br/>Probst: ...the Ulong tribe gets lost. <br/>Do you know the way to get back there? <br/>No. <br/>I'm trying. Don't get down my throat. <br/>Probst: And the game takes  Probst: And the game takes an incredible turn. an incredible turn. <br/>I had a lot of fun playing Survivor. I wish it had lasted quite a bit longer, but, unfortunately, I  guess tonight was my night to go. I hope the girls really stick up for themselves, because Lord  knows, the guys have proven that they're nothing special on our tribe, and I  really hope that, in the end, somebody from Ulong wins, end, somebody from  Ulong wins, and not somebody from Koror.
