<br/>Jeff: Previously on Survivor: The former Kucha tribe,  outnumbered by Ogakor's alliance, fought to stay alive by exploiting the  tribe's disdain for Jerri. <br/>Elisabeth: I think there's a crack in the tribe right now. Jerri-- I think she's going to get votes from their tribe. <br/>Jeff: Jerri won the reward challenge and chose Amber to  share in her victory, while back at camp, Barramundi had their own  celebration without them. <br/>Keith: What's missing? What's making it feel that way? The Wicked Witch of the West isn't here. [ Jerri laughing]  Jeff: Keith won immunity for the second time in a row. [ thunder crashing] The tribe hiked to tribal council in a  torrential rainstorm... Alicia. ...where the former Kucha members learned that Ogakor's alliance  was still strong. The tribe has spoken. Alicia was voted out, becoming the first member of the jury. Eight are left. Who will be the next to go? <br/>Colby: Last night it was just tossing and turning all  night. The floor of the tent was uncomfortable. When the rain started coming in, I was on the end, started  getting some water flow in my side of the tent, just draining off the tarp  that we lay on. And then wake up to see the rain like this, our fire's out. It's going to be a long day. <br/>Jerri: Right now my main concern is staying dry, 'cause I  don't want to get cold. So I'm just feeling kind of drained and lazy right now. So... I'm sleeping in. <br/>Elisabeth: It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood. <br/>Rodger: Yeah, maybe it'll clear off. Maybe it'll only rain half the day. <br/>Amber: I hope our sunny days aren't completely gone  though. <br/>Elisabeth: The rainy season is upon us. <br/>Keith: They don't call me fireman for nothing. <br/>Nick: Look at that. Look at that. <br/>Keith: The physical work is not light. You've got to go get wood, you've got to break it down, you've  got to keep the fire going. And life in the outback is tough, and it's getting tougher. It really is getting tougher for everybody. [ Nick gargling]  Elisabeth: What are you doing, Nick? <br/>Nick: I swear, every time I swallow my throat just burns. The roof of my mouth feels like it's been burned for the last  three days. <br/>Elisabeth: You have large taste buds? <br/>Nick: Enlarged. <br/>Elisabeth: Wow. <br/>Nick: I had in, like, three or four enlarged taste buds on  my tongue, which just is terrible. And I'm feeling better, but my mouth is still raw, so I can't  even drink water normally, and it's just, like, ugh. <br/>Tina: Sure doesn't look like the spring water from home. <br/>Rodger: No, that looks dirty. <br/>Nick: That's 'cause the river's so muddy. If it's been boiled, then I'll drink it. We're out of water. <br/>Rodger: We better... we need to definitely boil up some  water. <br/>Nick: Just dump it and get some more. <br/>Rodger: Yeah. <br/>Tina: The rain settled in here and it muddied our water,  and it's so cloudy, that fishing has not been good at all. We've lost all but two of our hooks because we have to fish from  shore and there's a lot of debris on the bottom. <br/>Rodger: Tina, would you come down here? I'm going to have to get out of the water. I've got a line hung up. <br/>Tina: You got a line stuck? <br/>Rodger: Yeah, about two feet offshore here. The water's just so much muddier. Of course I'm taking a chance on losing my hook in here, I do  know that. Let me poke this way... Maybe tomorrow, we got a full day, maybe  the water will clear up a little bit...  Tina: Yeah. <br/>Rodger: ...and try to get some fishing. Something besides rice. <br/>Colby: Because we're not having the fish, we're having to  rely on our rice. We're eating a lot more rice than maybe we should be. We're down to about two or three days supply at the rate we're  going. We still have eight people to feed. Keith, you want me to start the rice in ten minutes? <br/>Keith: Yeah, if Jerri's up for that. <br/>Amber: Or we could do the two cups of rice, it doesn't  matter. <br/>Elisabeth: Maybe go back to the two cups. <br/>Jerri: One more meal of rice is all we have left. <br/>Amber: At the most. <br/>Colby: Ooh. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my gosh, I knew it was going to be  something fun. <br/>Colby: A rope ladder. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my gosh. <br/>Colby: Oh, my gosh. Hey, guys, you guys are going to dig this one. <br/>Elisabeth: It's gonna be a good one. <br/>Colby: They have upped the ante. It came on a rope ladder. It says "Mental or physical, you never can tell. But you'll need a partner so, you must pair up well. One guy, one girl, one reward to split. If there's one reward to win, then this one is it." [  exclaiming happily]  Wow! <br/>Colby: So we're splitting the reward, and this one is  going to be big and chunky. <br/>Tina: A good one. <br/>Elisabeth: How do you guys think we should decide  partners? <br/>Amber: I don't know. Should we pull them out of the hat? <br/>Colby: You want to do that? <br/>Jerri: I don't think so. <br/>Elisabeth: You don't want to pull out of a hat? <br/>Jerri: No. I think we should pick. <br/>Elisabeth: Who would you pick? <br/>Jerri: I'd pick Colby. <br/>Tina: Well, duh, who wouldn't? <br/>Jerri: Well, the whole thing is, you know, when did this  game start being fair? <br/>Tina: No, but I think it is about team-manship. <br/>Rodger: I'm the old guy here, I know nobody wants to be  with me, but you know...  Amber: Oh, Rodger! <br/>Rodger: Sometimes you've just got to go with the flow. <br/>Tina: How we going to do it, Colby? <br/>Colby: I've got all the guys' names written on a piece of  paper. <br/>Amber: And the girls pick? <br/>Colby: Yep. <br/>Amber: Don't open it yet, till we all get one. <br/>Tina: Did I get one? <br/>Colby: Yep, you got it. Don't look at them yet. All right, you can look at them. <br/>Amber: Keith, you're my partner! <br/>Elisabeth: Nick, you're my partner. <br/>Jerri: Colby. <br/>Tina: Oh, my goodness. <br/>Elisabeth: That's funny. [ scattered chuckling]  Colby: Ready to rock? <br/>Jerri: Yeah. Ironically enough, I ended up being Colby's partner, anyway. I think it's important that people are constantly reminded of  the reality of our situation. There's nothing fair about this. And... you know, it's about winning. <br/>Colby: Jerri said, "Well, I don't want to draw  names." Tina said, "Why not?" She said, "I think we ought  to pick." She said "Who would you pick?" She said  "Colby." I'm sitting there going, well, now hold on, let's think  about who Colby would pick here. Granted, I want to win this thing, but I don't know that I want  to share with her whatever it is. <br/>Jeff: Come on in, guys. Today's reward challenge is the biggest one yet. A helicopter is going to land at Barramundi Beach and take you  to one of the Seven Wonders of the World-- the Great Barrier Reef. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my gosh. <br/>Jeff: Where you'll go snorkeling in the clear blue water,  and you'll be treated to a great lunch. The challenge is an obstacle course. You and your partner must stay together. There will be three heats with two teams competing. It's simple elimination. If you win, you advance. If you lose, you're out. The winners from the first two heats will move on to the final. The winning team is going to the Reef. You've already drawn straws to see who's going to race first. You've picked your partners. Let's go. This is heat number one. Winners move onto the final round. Survivors ready! Go! <br/>Jeff: Nice job, Keith and Amber. Take a break. Heat number two, winners will take on Amber and Keith in the  finals. Survivors ready! Go! <br/>Jeff: Way to go, Colby and Jerri. Final heat, winners get a private helicopter ride to the Great  Barrier Reef. Here we go. Survivors ready! Go! âª  Amber: Are you okay, Keith? âª  Amber: Are you okay, Keith? <br/>Keith: Just go...  Jerri: Come on, pull! <br/>Colby: Hold on. <br/>Jerri: Ready? [ Colby grunting]  Jerri: Okay. <br/>Colby: Go. <br/>Jerri: No! Colby! [ Jerri groans]  Colby: Come on, come on, come on. Go, go, go, go. Hurry up! Go on, hurry up. Hurry up, go. [ Jerri cries out]  Jeff: It's tight, it's tight. <br/>Colby: You got it. Come on. [ Jerri yells] You got it! [ Jerri yells]  Amber: Come on, Keith! Come on! [ Jerri yells]  Amber: Come on, Keith! <br/>Colby: That a girl. <br/>Jeff: You guys are going to the Great Barrier Reef. <br/>Amber: Are you packing all the Great Barrier Reef. <br/>Amber: Are you packing all your stuff? <br/>Jerri: Yeah, I'm going to get dressed, because we don't  have any idea what time. <br/>Keith: Colby left an hour ago. <br/>Jerri: He did not. They wouldn't do that. That would be so cruel. <br/>Elisabeth: Yeah, that totally would be cruel. <br/>Jerri: You guys are funny. <br/>Keith: He tried to wake you, and you said no, you didn't  want to go. <br/>Jerri: I thought for sure they'd be here by now. <br/>Amber: Me, too. [ engine whining]  Tina: Did y'all eat yet? <br/>Colby: Y'all could go ahead and start. <br/>Tina: Well, you may be hungry before your trip. You've got a long way to go. <br/>Amber: But the helicopter is going to be here any minute. [ helicopter blades whirring] [ Rodger yawning]  Jerri: There's got to be a little, little bit of animosity  and jealousy from everyone else for winning two rewards in a row. It bothers me a little bit 'cause I can see where that might  affect people's voting. But on the other hand, I really couldn't give a flying crap, at  this point. [ laughing]  Tina: Your limousine. <br/>Rodger: Y'all have... y'all have fun. Hope you... hope you get...  Elisabeth: We want details. <br/>Amber: Make sure you remember everything you see. <br/>Jerri: I will. <br/>Colby: I can't believe he just landed on our beach right  there. <br/>Amber: I know. <br/>Elisabeth: For you guys. <br/>So which of you two are coming for a fly with me today? <br/>Colby: We are. <br/>Yeah, my name's Craig. <br/>Colby: Colby. Nice to meet you, Craig. <br/>CRAIG: Colby. <br/>Jerri: Jerri. <br/>CRAIG: Jerri, how are you doing? <br/>Jerri: Nice to meet you. <br/>CRAIG: Let's head out to the machine. <br/>Elisabeth: Details, details. Take note of everything. <br/>Nick: I don't want details. <br/>Amber: This is something they're going to remember for the  rest of their lives. <br/>Nick: I'll remember this thing today, too. <br/>Amber: Yeah, we will, too, but...  Nick: Watching the helicopter go away. <br/>Keith: Well, the kids are go away. <br/>Keith: Well, the kids are gone for a day trip. <br/>Nick: Let's eat. <br/>Amber: Let's eat! <br/>Elisabeth: Let's eat. <br/>CRAIG: We're getting over level stuff now, we'll go down  and have a look at the trees, and give you a bit of a close-up look at the  bush. <br/>Colby: All right! <br/>Jerri: Yee-haw! <br/>Jerri: We're in the middle of  Jerri: Yee-haw! <br/>Jerri: We're in the middle of nowhere. <br/>CRAIG: Oh, yeah. As we come up on the river there, we're going to track pretty  much to the north, over some rugged outback stuff, so have a good look around  where you are. <br/>Colby: Sounds great. <br/>Colby: Oh, yeah! <br/>Jerri: Whoo! <br/>Colby: I really got to get me one of these choppers. <br/>CRAIG: Nice waterfalls up ahead. <br/>Jerri: Wow! <br/>CRAIG: Just a change of scenery. <br/>Colby: Just think, Jerri, we could be back on the beach  eating rice right now. <br/>Jerri: It was meant to be, Colby. <br/>Colby: I'm getting excited. <br/>Jerri: We land on the beach and I see a boat sitting  there. I'm, like, "What is going on?" This is... It couldn't  possibly get any better. [ whoops] I don't even want to think about anybody right now. <br/>Colby: No conversation about strategy or Survivortoday. <br/>Jerri: I can handle that. <br/>Colby: I told Jerri as soon as we got in the boat, I said,  "Here's the deal: No talk about the game, no strategy, no talk about the  other survivors. Let's just enjoy the day for what it is: a day off... and that's  it. <br/>Jerri: Can't wait to get some salt water in my hair. <br/>Colby: Can't wait to get some food in my belly. [ laughing]  Jerri: Wow! <br/>Colby: Oh... no. [ Jerri gasps]  Jerri: Is that champagne? <br/>Colby: Looks like champagne to me. <br/>Jerri: Oh, my God! <br/>Colby: Bottled water. <br/>Jerri: Oh, my God! <br/>Colby: Underwater cameras. Look at this. <br/>Jerri: Unbelievable! <br/>Colby: Look at all this! <br/>Jerri: We get under this tent and there is just this  spread. There's a basket full of all different kinds of fruits, wrapped  sandwiches, a bag of Doritos... there's pasta salad and sweet potatoes and  all these different vegetables. <br/>Colby: Look at this...  Jerri: A day at the beach! <br/>Colby: Look at what you get here-- a little brownie. <br/>Jerri: Oh! <br/>Colby: I know. Gol-lee! <br/>Jerri: Where do we start? <br/>Colby: Where do we start? <br/>Jerri: Perfect. <br/>Colby: I feel rather spoiled right now. <br/>Jerri: We got champagne over there. <br/>Colby: That'd be cool. We don't need to have alcohol, if we're going diving. [ Jerri laughs]  Jerri: Sure we do. [ cork pops] We just... we feasted for a good while, and then  realized, "I wonder how everybody else is doing?" But I knew. <br/>Amber: Around camp, we just kind of did, you know, daily  chores and stuff. Keith and I went and got some firewood and broke some firewood  up. Just normal taking care of our camp stuff, you know, and not too  exciting, but just enough to keep us busy to make the day go by a little bit  faster with nothing to do. Oh, no... he only said little things-- I think he's just really  enjoying himself. Just... you know... Why not? <br/>Nick: Just to get out of here and see one of the wonders  of the world would have been great. We're in the outback, but we're seeing, you know, the same basic  spot over and over and over. So to get out and see some really clear blue water and have a  big meal, it would've been great. <br/>Jerri: Here we are in the great. <br/>Jerri: Here we are in the middle of the Great Barrier  Reef. It was just too close to paradise. The setting-- it was very, very romantic, on top of everything  else. I even looked at him at one point and I was, like, "This is  one hell of a first date, Colby." I couldn't have come out here  Colby." I couldn't have come out here with a better person than Colby. We're having a great time. We're getting to know each other outside of the game and outside  of that environment. This is basically the perfect honeymoon without the sex. <br/>Colby: Jerri was quite giddy on our little getaway. <br/>Jerri: Mmm! <br/>Colby: She made a comment to me about it being a honeymoon  without the sex, and it couldn't be farther from the truth for me. I mean, we certainly didn't sit around and high five and say,  "Man, we finally get our time alone together," you know? That's not what I was looking for. I was just looking for some down time away from the game and  that's what I got. I do not want to leave here. <br/>Jerri: I don't, either. <br/>Colby: It's hard back on Barramundi Beach, being out there  26 days going on a month, and not have anything but rice, so we're just going  to go back in and try to be as humble as possible about it. If somebody pisses me off, then I'm going to just say, "I  got to go snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef. What did you do today?"  Jerri: Returning to Barramundi right now is... I'm not  really looking forward to it. But I at least am going back feeling rejuvenated and renewed and  a little bit more like my true self. Because, man, after 26 days of putting on the game face and  being this tough, you know, "don't mess with me" chick-- but I got  a tender side, too. I feel like a little bit of that was touched today. <br/>Keith: Well, let's see what was touched today. <br/>Keith: Well, let's see what this noise is here. That chopper is definitely coming. Yep, there it is. Here they are. <br/>Elisabeth: Where? <br/>Keith: Right coming over the trees. Right there. <br/>Elisabeth: There they are. <br/>Yeah. We want details. <br/>Jerri: That was awesome. <br/>Amber: Your meal? What was your meal? <br/>Jerri: Start out...  Colby: Bananas, apples and oranges. <br/>Mmm. <br/>Mmm. <br/>Jerri: A couple of nectarines. <br/>Colby: And a couple of nectarines. I wish everyone could have come with us. <br/>Elisabeth: Good jump start. You got a jump start. <br/>Jerri: Yeah. <br/>Colby: But since you couldn't, I brought a little bit of  the reef back to you. [ laughter] Everybody gets their own piece of coral. <br/>Yay! <br/>Oh! <br/>Amber: How exciting! <br/>Tina: Wow. That's very nice of you to do, Colby. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, my gosh! <br/>Colby: This is Rodger's. <br/>Oh...  Rodger: Thank you. <br/>Amber: Thank you so much! <br/>Elisabeth: Thanks. It's...  Colby: This one is Keith's, and it has a little empty  space, kind of like the one between his ears. [ laughter]  Rodger: There you go. <br/>Oh. <br/>Colby: Here's your, uh, orange for Tennessee. <br/>Rodger: Oh, man. <br/>Tina: Oh, Colby, thank you! <br/>Jerri: Colby's little, um, shell maneuver was most  definitely strategy. For me, in a perfect world, it would be me and him sitting up  there in front of the jury. I find him and myself to be the most even on the playing field,  more than anybody else here. And so now, because of that little maneuver, I'm thinking...  that he's got one up on me, for sure. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Elisabeth: Colby, thank you so much. <br/>Colby: You're welcome. I wish y'all could have been there. <br/>Tina: That was so thoughtful. <br/>Amber: This is so cool! <br/>It's so cool! <br/>Rodger: Back there. <br/>Elisabeth: Oh, wonder. <br/>Rodger: That's exactly...  Colby: That's one of the seven wonders of the world. <br/>Rodger: Yeah. Yeah. Ha. <br/>Nick: Hey, Keith, can you grab the funnel? <br/>Colby: Immunity is going to determine who goes next time,  just like immunity determined who... who's going tonight. Nick comes over from Kucha, and as Ogakor, we're still trying to  maintain some sort of control. We determined a long time ago that Nick was more of a threat  than say Elisabeth and Rodger. So that determines why Nick goes before them. <br/>Elisabeth: Suckers. <br/>Rodger: That's it. [ clattering in box]  Nick: Oh, I need some water. <br/>Rodger: Grasshopper's in the box! <br/>Keith: Nick's a strong guy, although Nick's pretty much  had it. He's-He's burned out, and he says, "Listen, I'm rea... You  know, I'm ready to go." So, I don't feel real bad about that. <br/>Elisabeth: I don't think we've been alone together in a  long time, the three of us. <br/>Nick: That's true. <br/>Rodger: You're right. <br/>Elisabeth: The remaining Kucha survivors. <br/>Rodger: This wind's blowing right at ya. <br/>Elisabeth: Yeah. Well, basically, Kucha's outnumbered right now by Ogakor, and  there's a chance, one by one, we could go. I know Nick feels as if he's probably the next to go out of our  tribe, but if he wins immunity, it could just as easily be me or Rodger. <br/>Nick: If I don't win the immunity challenge, I think I'm a  goner. I'll go boil water. <br/>Rodger: Well, maybe that's why. They...  Elisabeth: We slave away in the outback...  Rodger: They know... They know...  Elisabeth: ...as our numbers fall. <br/>Rodger: They know that they got us. They know they got us. <br/>Nick: Winning the immunity challenge is important to stay  alive. You know, you get out there, and you try to compete and try to  win immunity challenges, but looks like everybody is voting on tribal lines  at this point. <br/>Wow. <br/>Amber: Oh, wow. <br/>Oh! <br/>Jerri: "Those with good balance are in for a treat,  'cause now we find out..."  JERRI/Elisabeth: "...who's sure on their  feet."  Jerri: "If you keep steady and don't rock the boat,  you'll head to the council, safe from the votes."  Keith: Today's the immunity challenge. It's an important day for everybody. The mail insinuated that we're standing there on some kind of a  log structure, and I think it's going to be in the water. <br/>Jeff: I'll take this again. <br/>Keith: Yep. <br/>Jeff: Mr. Consistency. <br/>Keith: From time to time. <br/>Jeff: Put it back on its perch. Are you predicting another victory today? <br/>Keith: Ah, I don't know. <br/>Jeff: You're going to have to share the wealth. <br/>Keith: Luck is on my side. <br/>Jeff: All right. Today's immunity challenge is going to test your balance, not  your strength. In fact, one of the keys is figuring out how to use your  opponent's strength against them to knock them off balance. There will be three rounds. Each round's a different challenge. It's single elimination. Lose, you're out. Win, you move on. First round, you'll climb up onto the towers, one against  another, and using a rope, you're going to try and knock your opponent off  balance into the water. It's not a tug of war. You can pull on the rope, or if you want, just let it go. Next round, you have a shaky beam. So, it's all about using your legs and redistributing weight to  get them forward or backwards. <br/>Amber: Wow. <br/>Jeff: For the last round, the finalists will square off on  a pair of unsteady platforms. <br/>Rodger: Wow. Cool. <br/>Jeff: As always, tribal council tonight, immunity at  stake. Certainly for one person. Big, big stakes tonight. Now, to be fair, you guys have already randomly drawn names to  decide who will compete against one another in the first round. <br/>Okay. <br/>Jeff: All right. Let's do it. Keith, Rodger, you're up. Survivors ready! Go! <br/>Keith: I love ya, but you've got to go. <br/>Oh! <br/>Elisabeth: Whoa. <br/>Keith: Dog you. <br/>Rodger: Sneaky little devil, ain't ya? [ laughter] [ screaming] [ applause and cheering]  Rodger: Yeah! Whoo! [ mumbling]  Jeff: Rodger, moving on to... [ applause and  cheering]  Rodger: Whoo! <br/>Jeff: Nick, Jerri, grab your rope. <br/>Jerri: Do we have to put our wrist in this thing? <br/>Jeff: Yep. <br/>Colby: Put it around your neck. [ Colby laughs]  Jeff: Survivors, ready. Go! <br/>Rodger: Oh. Did you see his foot come up? <br/>Oh! [ applause]  Jeff: Nick! Moving on to round two. Survivors ready. <br/>Tina: Ready-o! <br/>Jeff: Go! <br/>Tina: Ah. <br/>Jerri: Better be careful. You know how he treats women. <br/>Tina: Oh! <br/>Oh! <br/>Amber: That was a quick one! <br/>Tina: Ha-ha! <br/>Amber: Oh-ho. That was quick. <br/>Jeff: Colby's moving on. <br/>Elisabeth: Colby, you're cruel. [ Colby laughs]  Jeff: Survivors ready! Go! <br/>Keith: Amber is an aggressive little kitten. [ shrieking]  Oh. <br/>Jeff: Amber, moving on! <br/>Jerri: Good job. <br/>Jeff: Okay, round two. Once again, you've randomly chosen the names of your opponents. Here we go. Winner moves on to the finals and a shot at immunity. Survivors ready. Go! <br/>Oh, oh, get it, Rodg! Get it, Rodg. <br/>Amber: Yeah, Rodger! <br/>Come on, Rodg. <br/>Go, Rodg. <br/>Kick it, Rodg. Kick it, Rodg. <br/>Uh-oh. Uh-oh. <br/>Oh! [ screaming] [ applause]  ...Rodg. <br/>Rodger: Aah! <br/>Colby: Yeah, yeah! <br/>Jeff: Colby, moving on! Survivors ready. Go! <br/>Elisabeth: Whoo! Shake those things. They look like they're doing some sort of strange dance. <br/>Oh, oh. <br/>Nick: I can't quite do that like you can. <br/>Nick: Oh. Oh, oh. <br/>ALL: Whoa! Oh! <br/>Oh. <br/>Yeah! <br/>Jeff: Nick, moving on to the final round! This is it! For immunity. The only thing that can guarantee your security at tonight's  tribal council. Survivors ready! Go! <br/>Oh. <br/>Keith: Ooh. Ooh! <br/>Nick: Yeah, baby! [ applause and cheering]  Jeff: Nick wins immunity! <br/>Oh, Nick! <br/>Hey, Nick! <br/>Jeff: Way to go, Nick. Barramundi, see you tonight at tribal council. <br/>Jerri: Yeah! <br/>Rodger: Good job, buddy! <br/>Elisabeth: Yeah, yeah...  Nick: I hope I didn't seal your fate. <br/>Elisabeth: Hmm? <br/>Nick: I hope I didn't seal your fate. <br/>Elisabeth: ...well, you know...  Rodger: Could have been either one of us here. That's just...  Nick: Yeah. <br/>Rodger: That's just the way the old ball bounces. <br/>Elisabeth: Uh-huh. <br/>Amber: It's weird, but I think they all just know, so  they've come to accept it. So, I think it's totally...  Jerri: The main thing that's changing now that Nick has  won today's immunity is that we were all going to vote him off tonight. So, it was discussed on the walk back to camp who we would be  voting for instead. It was decided by the ex-Ogakor tribe that, um, Elisabeth would  be the next one to go. <br/>Elisabeth: It made me scared a little. I was, like...  Rodger: Yeah, yeah. Could be me or you. <br/>Elisabeth: It could be. <br/>Amber: The tribal council's definitely never a place where  I want to go. I hate going every single time. It's voting somebody off. It doesn't matter if you've been with that person the whole  entire time or only a couple days. It's still really hard to do. I definitely want to talk to, you know, Jerri and Colby and Tina  and Keith tonight to see if our original plan's still in effect. The plan was kind of just get rid of Kucha one by one by one. <br/>Elisabeth: You guys are pretty much in control-- you know  that-- 'cause of your numbers. And, I mean, I... My next vote would be for Jerri, anyway. I think that she just brings people down, and I don't like how  she is to even people on her own tribe. Her allegiance is only to herself. <br/>Tina: Mm-hmm. But we have to vote you or Rodger off. <br/>Elisabeth: Mm-hmm. <br/>Tina: Because, you know, that's the safe thing to do. <br/>Elisabeth: Right. <br/>Tina: It's hard. It's hard to talk about. <br/>Elisabeth: Mm-hmm. <br/>Tina: You know, because you and Rodger just have more of  that heart and soul that we want. Me and Colby and Keith usually get together and talk about the  order. We all agree or disagree on things. <br/>Colby: But there is one other alternative. That we can eliminate Jerri. <br/>Keith: I mean... we are... We're stuck with her... Well...  I don't know. <br/>Colby: Keith, I'm sorry, but we're talking about a lot of  money at stake. <br/>Keith: No, I understand that. I understand that, man. <br/>Colby: Okay. <br/>Keith: We have an opportunity that is staring us right in  the face, and it's guaranteed. Want to get rid of Jerri collectively? <br/>Colby: Keith, listen to what you just said. Why would we allow that possibility to even come to fruition  when we've got an opportunity right now to keep things going exactly the way  they are, and then get rid of Jerri as soon as we can? And, boy, do I want to. Man, I had to put up with her all day yesterday. <br/>Keith: You know, it's, uh...  Colby: I can't imagine getting rid of Elisabeth over her,  but...  Keith: I know, and, uh...  Colby: It's just... It's-It's...  Keith: My gut tells me...  Colby: It's the right move. <br/>Keith: I understand. I mean, it makes sense. <br/>Colby: Blue. <br/>Jerri: Hey. <br/>Rodger: Hey, now. Here you go. <br/>Jerri: We're off like a herd of turtles. [ indistinct conversation]  Jeff: Now, I'll bring in the [ indistinct  conversation]  Jeff: Now, I'll bring in the first member of our jury. The jury is not to be addressed. No comments, reference to the jury. The jury will not speak to you. The jury is merely here to gather information that they will use  in deciding which one of the final two gets the million dollars. Each tribal council, as you guys are voted off, you will become  a part of the jury, and the power will shift to that side. Nick, on a scale of one to ten, how important was immunity for  you today? <br/>Nick: Oh, this is a ten. If, um... if I hadn't won immunity today, I fully expected to  get voted off. <br/>Jeff: Based on? <br/>Nick: Based on the way voting has been going, uh, based on  my place in the tribe. Uh, I-I fully expected if I lost today to, uh, be sitting on...  in the jury the next... next time around, so...  Jeff: Jerri, as you look at the jury, you got one member  over there. You guys, right now, have a onein-eight shot at a million bucks. Have you surprised yourself with the way you've acted out here? <br/>Jerri: Honestly, I had no idea that this was going to be  as tough as it is. And I have woken up in the morning and gone through an entire  day wondering who I am. Things come out of my mouth in frustration and out of hunger and  just stress that, after they come out, I want to suck them back in and...  'cause I... It's not something that I would normally say or... or act. So, yeah, I've surprised myself in a lot of ways. <br/>Jeff: Elisabeth, due to the numbers, you're having to sort  of go their way. Worried at all? Strong competitor, you're going to be tough if you get to the  final two. You're probably a target at some point. <br/>Elisabeth: That definitely goes through my mind. You know, you come here, and basically, anyone is a target. But when you're in a minority, you know, of numbers, the reality  sets in a little more harshly. You're always vulnerable here. Nothing is guaranteed, and you can't assume anything, because  that's the most dangerous, dangerous thing you can possibly do here in the  outback in this game is assume. Assume you're safe, assume you're right. You're not. And, so I come here prepared... for the worst. <br/>Jeff: So, let's vote. Elisabeth, you're first. <br/>Amber: Elisabeth, this is Elisabeth, you're first. <br/>Amber: Elisabeth, this is going to be the hardest vote  yet, and the hardest vote for the rest of the game. But the only reason why I am making it is because I made a word  with my original tribe, and I want to stick to my word. <br/>Rodger: Most days, she gets I want to stick to my word. <br/>Rodger: Most days, she gets up in a good mood, but oh,  baby, look out if she gets up in a bad mood. <br/>Jerri: I've never in my life mood. <br/>Jerri: I've never in my life met anyone more likable and  more lovable. Because you are such a likable person, it is a definite threat. <br/>Jeff: I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final. The person voted out of the tribe will be asked to leave the  tribal council area immediately. First vote... Elisabeth. Jerri. Elisabeth. Jerri. Two votes Elisabeth, two votes Jerri. Three votes Jerri. Four votes Jerri, two votes Elisabeth. Five votes Jerri. That's enough. You need to bring me your torch. <br/>Jerri: Checkmate. You guys got me. [ laughs] Good game. <br/>Jeff: Jerri, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go. Based on that vote, maybe the game haschanged, and a new tribe  finally has been born. Barramundi is alive and kicking. You guys can head back to camp. <br/>Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode and hear  what Jerri has to say. Next time on Survivor: The tribe wakes up and realizes that  Jerri is really gone. <br/>Colby: Sweet. <br/>Elisabeth: Her own tribe voted against her. <br/>Jeff: But the survivors are too hungry to celebrate. <br/>Elisabeth: I'm just, like, shaking and weak. <br/>Jeff: They are offered more food, but at what price? <br/>Jerri: You know, it's funny because I absolutely knew this  was coming. It must have been my remark about how this game isn't fair. I'm pretty sure that's what set everyone off. I've had a great time. And I'm still up for sitting around with everybody having a beer  and laughing about this whole thing.
